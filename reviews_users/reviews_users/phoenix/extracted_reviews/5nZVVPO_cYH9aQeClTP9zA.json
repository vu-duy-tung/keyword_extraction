Most of them are perfectly nice, but the guy usually on the register (short brown hair) is the rudest, most arrogant, obnoxious person who has ZERO business being in customer service. He constantly gets things mixed up and acts like it's the customers fault. His entire attitude says \"I'm better than you and you're an idiot for requiring my services to take your order\" even though, you know, that's his freaking job. I work nearby so we drop in here very frequently and this guy puts a bad taste in my mouth and my coworkers have made similar observations. If he hates people so much, why did he chose a front of house position? Rethink your choices and stop raining on everyone else's day.",

The chicken pasta broccoli and cheese is so mouth watering, their salads are always extremely fresh, for a fast casual restaurant their lasagna is surprisingly good too. All in all, Sauce is one of my favorite places to eat in old town when I'm looking for a quick delicious meal.",

Every time we come to eat here the service is friendly and helpful, probably the best I've had from a \"fast casual\" type of restaurant.

    "text": "Sauce is either hit or miss. It's a bit on the expensive side and suffers from mediocre management.   It's one of those semi self-serve places; you walk up to a cashier to order, seat yourself, wait for servers to bring your order to your table and they might also come around to ask you if you need anything such as a drink refill.  The ambiance is hip, comfortable and open which makes it an ideal spot to catch-up with friends.   An entree item (pizza or salad) will cost you around $10. The pizzas are scrumptious but I suggest getting normal/thin crust over their newer thick/pan crust. Every time I've had the thicker crust it's been over-cornmeal'd. Being on a budget, I usually order the mushroom and artichoke bruschetta and a soft drink for just under $7. If I can spend a bit more I'll go for the caesar salad, though I skip the unsatisfactorily dry, cold chicken add-on.  The service is even more hit-or-miss than the food. Their staff seems to have a high turn-over rate with the exception of a couple great food servers. I've had visits where the employees have been fantastic, and others where the cashiers have acted like I was doing them a favor. During a particularly unfortunate and embarrassing incident a young woman incorrectly took my order and when the resulting price was significantly more than it should have been I politely corrected her. She then stormed off into the kitchen and yelled at the staff, \"HE DOESN'T WANT THE PIZZA ANYMORE!! HE WANTS THE BRUSCHETTA NOW.\" loud enough to be clearly heard from the dining area. I should have then called a manager but instead I accepted the $7 embarrassment and wouldn't return for nearly six months.  I've since returned to satisfactory experiences. Hit or miss ... it's the risk you take.",

Ordered a pasta dish and a pizza. The pasta was out quick in less then ten minutes. Lousy pasta overcooked, sauce tasted sweet like Chef Boyardee.   It took them 30 minutes + to get the pizza, by this time my pasta is cold. Had I not said something to the runner, we would have never gotten pizza.   The manager came over, apologized, said it was her fault. She never once explained what was the reason that a table of 6 that arrived 20 minutes after us had five pizzas served, never comped the dinner, but did offer cookies?!!!!!  IS THIS RESTAURANT A JOKE??? ?  Cookies is going to resolve a service issue????  Where I come from, a round of drinks is offered to alleviate tension, or perhaps the dinner is comped, but COOKIES???  Give me a break...her calling is definitely NOT in the service industry. I think Girl Scouts of America is hiring a cookie maitre d'",

My cousin had a panini and mac n cheese, both of which he really enjoyed and I had a seasonal salad with arugula, watermelon, sunflower seeds and feta. It was seriously delish!! Here's the weird thing, my friend went to use her Fox gift card and the manager said they were no longer affiliated with FRC.....who knew?? She was very accommodating though, she was able to change the FOX card into a Sauce card so that was really nice. A server came over and checked on us a few times, refilled drinks and picked up empty plates so if you go....don't forget to tip these folks!!",

I took a bite of each of my friends' dishes and everything tasted great. I ordered the sausage and caramelized onion pizza and added some red peppers. OMG, it was so amazing! It was a perfect combination of flavors and the thin crust was also very good! The kitchen accidentally made a cheese and basil pizza and kindly offered it to us! Even without a great amount of toppings it was a delicious pizza. My friend's daughter was in love with it, and she is typically a picky eater! I had a bite of my friends dishes - lasagna and mac n' cheese- they were both very flavorful and you could taste that they were made with fresh ingredients. It was a beautiful day outside so we decided to sit outside, the staff was very kind and brought out a high chair for the 2 year old. I was impressed at the size and quality of food that they serve with reasonable prices. I see that Yelp has a lot of good things to say about their salads, so I plan to get one next time! I cannot wait to come back for more, but I will admit it will be difficult to order anything other than their amazing sausage and caramelized onion pizza.",

I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.    My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal...   What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy.",

The rich white sauce lacked flavor,and the broccoli looked good but tasted odd. The chicken was completely different from the chicken on the salad - in a good way, but it was still kind of odd.

One manager already had me pegged for a Spinach, Pancetta, and Goat cheese salad.  He was right, since it was pretty much the only salad I'd choose, mostly bec. many of the other choices contained allergens.  Meatballs were calling my name as well, so I chose to order the salad ($6.50), plus chicken ($2), and a side of one meatball ($1).  Paid and took my tag number to a booth.    Salad, w/c glistened beautifully dressed w/ a balsamic vinaigrette, came topped w/ what looked like a teaspoon of lightly toasted pancetta and a tablespoon of crumbled goat cheese.  Chicken was missing, but was quickly brought to the table- about a quarter-cup, shredded, served cold in a dipping bowl.  In another dipping bowl sat my one lone meatball and a little dollop of red sauce.  I savored this little morsel w/ the dinner roll that came w/ the salad.  (The meal would have been perfect had the dinner roll been toasted crusty and warm!)  Aside from the counter and barstool dining area, the rest of the restaurant made me feel like I was eating at a cafeteria, w/c didn't lend any pizazz to my dining experience.  However, this speedbump won't keep me from returning to try other dishes (and more of those luscious meatballs!).",

Thus the veggies were warm but mostly raw and coated with dressing.  They need to work the gluten in the hand/tossed crust, truly roast the veggies, and keep the heat properly distributed in the oven.",

There was lots of cheese in the sandwich, and the soup was the type that is creamier and lighter in color.  It tasted like it may have had red peppers along with the tomatoes but I'm not certain as the menu didn't specify.  Either way, it was tasty!  Pretty happy for the first time getting food here!  ** only complaint about the grilled cheese is it wasn't buttery.... and I prefer them REALLY buttery!",

I no longer care about anything else.     I've tried to replicate this salad because really, it's pretty simple as far as ingredients go:  kale, romaine hearts, currants, cashews, (farro I leave out b/c I have no idea where to get it), and salmon.  See, simple.    Two things:  the dressing and the salmon are what set it over the edge. The champagne vinaigrette is outstanding.  Side note:  they sometimes allow you to buy a cup of salad dressing to go.   The salmon.  I don't are what I do, I can't replicate the richness of their salmon.  I just can't.    I have a sneaking suspicion that they do something bad to their salmon, like cook it in a stick of butter, to get it that rich and delicious.  I don't EVEN want to know.  All I know is, that salad is goooooooo-ooood.  And, in total is $11.  DEAL!  Oh, service is always great whether you dine in or carry out.",

We got a caprese salad, pepperoni pizza, and a side of meatballs to split. The caprese salad was delicious and different than I expected it was a salad with lettuce with chunks of tomatoes, mozzarella, and pieces of bread, I would definitely get this again! Side note: the Caesar salad is really good too. I am a huge fan of the pizzas, they are thin crust, I've had a few different ones and enjoyed all of them, perfect to split between 2 people (~$8-10 per pizza). Its a nice place if you want to have a casual meal, you order at the front then they deliver your food to you (sort of like a pei wei or noddles& co).",

While they are pretty well known for their pizza which is absolutely delish, I usually tend to eat a little on the healthier side and get either the turkey and feta salad or this other salad that has pears in it (I kind of forget exactly what it is, but I've gotten it a few times). I also like the soup and you can't go wrong with their turkey sandwich either. Oh, and their mac n cheese!!! So delish. Those are pretty good standbys, and it's nice that they give you bread and butter on the side no matter what you order, even if you do get a sandwich which a lot of places tend to skimp on the bread if you ordered bread as a staple of your meal (which is probably better for you anyway, but thanks for the extra bread, Sauce!) It's also nice that it's really close to a lot of stuff, so it's a good lunch spot during the work day. Don't get caught browsing at Urban Outfitters while you wait for your food though or you might get stuck spending 100 bucks in about 5 minutes like I did last time I went. Yikes.",

Right across the street from Fashion Square, this place is in a prime location for shoppers to rest their weary feet and escape from the frantic craze that is Christmastime at the mall. All of their food is delicious, but my personal favorite combo is the Chicken, pine nut, tomato & Gorgonzola salad with the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza (split between friends). The pizzas are mostly all under $10 a piece, and if you're not starving and don't want to share, you can get one of their many pasta sides and leave it at that. I like to enjoy a glass of wine with my lunch, and they have plenty to choose from. In the summertime, they even have a $20 special that gets you a pizza, salad, and two glasses of wine. That's $10 bucks each for you and a friend! The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the interior decor is seriously lacking (reminds me of a nice cafeteria), and you aren't able to take your wine to any of the outside tables because their patio is not closed off to the sidewalk. Overall, though, this place rocks!",

I've eaten at the one at Glendale and 7th Street in Phoenix many times on several trips to the Valley, but stopped at the Waterfront location after some last minute Christmas shopping at Fashion Square (btw, Waterfront is really nice, first time I had been to it). It's very casual; you order at the counter after deciding from a menu on the wall. They have salads, sandwiches, thin crust pizzas, and pastas. I had the chicken pesto, tomato, and aged parmesan pizza. Their pizzas are very simple, with only a few ingredients, but there's a great variety of pizzas. After you order at the counter, they give you a number to put on your table and deliver your food when it is ready. The pizza I ordered was excellent. It had a simple taste to it, but it tasted really good. The only complaint I had about it was there could've been more pesto sauce. Overall, if you're looking for a quick convenient place to eat that has great food, head to Sauce. According to the website, there are 5 Valley locations, 3 Tucson area locations, and one Denver location. Now all they need is a Cleveland area location.",

Earth to Scottsdale, this is not LA and never will be.  Look at me, I had lunch at Sauce!  Makes me laugh every time.  I went to the Sauce in Phoenix and it was deicious.  Solid quality, fresh salad and pizza.  However, this Sauce in Scottsdale can be described as average and inconsistent.  I like the cucumber, tomatoe, feta salad.  I got it  2 times and both times were BATHING in dressing.  The balsalmic was so overly proportioned that I actually felt my stomach pH drop another 2 points.  I didn't complain because as I look behind the counter, there was no chef  nor sou chef therefore absolutely zero quality control.  Its only saving grace is that it's across the street from the mall and if you're famished then you can grab a bite.  which is what I did.  I think I'm going to have to stuff half a of head of lettuce in my purse so I can avoid going there out of hunger desperation. I have to clarify that I do that as well, I goto restaurants to be seen and feel cool but I do it in LA at places like The Ivy.  At least my ridulousness is justified when the Hilton sisters were eating their salads next to me.",

We waited about 15-20 minutes and they brought out his mac and cheese (which was almost cheese-less) and a stale roll that tasted like the ones from a high school cafeteria. I expected my salad to come out right behind. The waitress sure didn't say anything about it. Another 15 minutes went by.. My husband was almost done with his food by then, and then my food arrived. The salad was pretty good, but the waitress didn't even apologize for the wait. It is a little strange to send food for the same table out at different times. I don't think the food was worth the money and I don't know if that I will ever return.",

So I got my housemates together (which included a nine month old boy) and we headed out.  We got there, walked in, perused the menu and ordered.  I got a chicken, pesto, and parmesan pizza.  One of my mates had the ham and pineapple and the other a mushroom creation.  Both of them said their pizzas were very good.  I had a similar opinion however I would have prefered chicken chunks rather than shredded the way they had it.  I had a nice Shiraz with my pizza which was a good decision.  I liked the location and the modern cafe ambience was very cool too.  The staff was friendly, hip, and pretty (there was a blonde hostess there that kinda got to me in a good way) .  The patrons ran the spectrum as far as what you'd expect in the heart of Scottsdale's \"urban\" core (I must admit I think I fell in love 3-5 times).  After we (barely) finished eating meals our little guy decided he'd had enough and made it clear.  We exploited the ideal location and went for a little walk around Old Town which was a nice way to end the outing.  (+) Food Location Staff Atmosphere  (-) Shredded Chicken",

    "text": "While driving down to PF Changs down by Fashion Square for a mothers day lunch, we passed by this place and decided on it instead to try something new. It looked busy outside on the patio so I figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place. I have only been to one other Fox restaurant and that is True Food Kitchen, which I like a lot. This place..... meh.  We walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none.   Also, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did. And I still feel like I shouldn't have. All in all I spent $34 dollars on about $5 worth of ingredients. I wont be back.",

I have also noticed that things aren't always \"hot\" when they get to you.  Other than those minor issues, Sauce is the perfect place for a quick lunch with colleagues or after an afternoon of power shopping. I recommend their Veggie Salad with the gorgonzola dressing (it doesn't come with the salad so you have to ask  for it by name!).",

Overall, it is a pretty great deal.  We ordered the Chicken, Spinach, and Apple salad with the Lasagna pizza. We also substituted wine for soft drinks, which Sauce was fine with. The salad came out with plenty of chicken and tasted delicious. The brick oven cooked pizza came out a few minutes later. The pizza was high quality overall, and the taste was on par with some of the better pizza places I've eaten at in the past.  I'm only giving Sauce a 3 star review for 2 reasons: Subtracting 1 star for lack of discount applied for checking into Yelp. On the Yelp page for Sauce it says \"Check in for 10% off any bill over $10.\" The manager says that 10% off is not applicable to the 2 for 20 deal, even though on Yelp there are no stipulations and on the in store advertisement there are no conditions on the 2 for 20, except that it expires Aug 31. Subtracting a second star for pizza cut. The pizza was poorly cut, and slices had to be fully cut with a knife at the table.  Recommendations to management: Don't contradict your advertising. You got us in the door with the 2 for 20 deal and we were even more excited about the 10% off on Yelp. Unfortunately, we felt a little cheated, which doesn't really breed repeat customers, regardless of how good the food is.",

I've never had a problem with this restaurant before, the food is normally decent, but this has been my worst experience ordering from a restaurant in my life. I'm not 100% sure if it's the restaurants fault or the doordash delivery man's, but the cannoli I ordered was in a closed container so there's no way the bug could have made it's way into the food while inside my house. I'm not sure what on Earth kind of bug it is but it was literally inside the cannoli while I was eating it and I am so so so so thankful I noticed it before I took a bite of it. Ahhh please clean your kitchen! I'm sorry if this review causes problems for the restaurant or any of the employees but I am so incredibly revolted. Never ordering from here again. Also I'd just like to add since it's hard to tell in the picture but the bug was ALIVE AND CRAWLING ALL OVER and i'm gonna go throw up now bye.",

My boyfriend likes Sauce and I hadn't been there in years so I decided to give it another shot! Wasn't too crowded when we went, and I was happy to see all of the vegetarian pizza options! The bruchetta looked good too. I was incredibly hungry when I came and was so grateful that we were able to order and receive our food pretty quickly! I ended up getting the artichoke portabella mushroom pizza. My boyfriend got one with chicken sausage or something, I don't remember but I do know that he liked it! The pizza looked so amazing when it arrived and I was happy to see the thin crust. The outside was crispy and I liked it! Almost cracker-like. It was good. The middle got a little too soggy, was flopping when I picked the slice up. But was still not too bad! The one weird thing was every few bites I'd get a chlorine smell/taste. My boyfriend did not have this issue with his pizza so idk what was wrong with mine! Maybe it was the water the vegetables were washed with or something?  It wasn't so strong that it was inedible or I felt the need to complain, but it was odd. The rolls were great though I loved them haha. Well I still feel unsure of Sauce but I'm not totally opposed to returning!",

When I got to the restaurant the line to order was out the door. They had two employees taking orders and doing to go orders while about 4 employees just stood around talking.

All pizzas were really good, I prefer a thicker crust pizza than thin but after eating 5 different types of slices, they all tasted the same to me (texture wise). Never bit into a slice and didn't like it.. but I also don't discriminate pizza.  I was charged incorrectly on their cider (which was really good btw) and I didn't realize it til I saw my cc statement after I've already arrived back home in California.  Eryn, the manager at Sauce, helped me out through the phone and was very sincere and understanding about the entire issue that happened.  I am forever grateful for good service and if I ever go to AZ again I'd go to Sauce to say thank you to Eryn, but also to order more pizzas.",

    "text": "I have been to Sauce Pizza and Wine many of times. I have been to this location and the location on Baseline in Mesa (which I actually like more). It is an easy option for a quick and good meal after shopping and I overall recommend it to anyone. Who can say no to Italian?  I decided to come today to grab a quick lunch with a friend. This is an order-at-the-counter kind of restaurant so it is convenient if you don't have a lot of time or are on a lunch break. I've never had to wait for a seat here, but I'm sure during lunch hour it gets busier which might lead to a 10-15 minute wait. When you walk in there is a big menu on the chalk board wall that is easy to read, organized, and simple. You then order at the counter, they give you a number, and you pick your own seat. There is generous inside and outside seating. The overall ambience of the restaurant is comfy and clean.  We decided to sit outside on the patio. The food came quick, but in a timely matter and we were hungry so we were happy about that. I got the Italian chopped salad and my friend got a pizza with mushrooms. Each of the entrees comes with a complementary bread roll and butter, which is delicious. I liked the meat and cheese in my salad. It was good, but it had too much dressing on it which made it soggy. I usually ask for it on the side and forgot, so my fault. But, I probably wouldn't get that salad again. My friend's pizza was thin crust and I tried it, it was very good. They both are a pretty generous portion. I have also tried the Mac and Cheese here which I get with broccoli and chicken and it is really really good. I have also tried all their bruschetta. I definitely recommend both of them. Each of the entrees are priced around 8-13 dollars which is reasonable especially because the portions are pretty big.   The service was great. The guy who took my order was friendly enough and helpful. He offered me a cup for water which was nice. The girl who brought our food was really great though. I'm not sure what her name was. But she offered to have them remake the salad for me, which I appreciated a lot but declined since it was technically my fault for not asking for the dressing on the side. She brought my friend a side of ranch and told us if we needed anything else to just let her know. She seemed genuinely happy to serve us and make sure our experience was as good as possible.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is in a good location for anyone that is at the mall looking for something good to eat. It is a quick and easy option for lunch or dinner. It also is kid and family friendly.",

So I tell them again that I'll be placing an order for pick up, and they ask me to hold again. So I let them know I had already waited 5 minutes to order, and he still pushed to have me hold AGAIN. When I only have 30 minutes for lunch and I'll still have to wait another 10-15 for them to make my food, I don't have time to hold over and over. Needless to say, I've crossed them off of the list of places for lunch in the area.",

We waited quite a while on our pizzas, so we were quite happy when they came out. Right away, I went to pick up a piece and the pizza was not barely a hint of warmth, obviously they were sitting around for a while. We returned the pizzas, waited what seemed like another 20 minutes, finally my wife and I both asked for status on our pizzas.   My wife went to another wait staff that was very friendly and went out  of his way to make things right. He was super customer friendly and apologetic, the manager showed up shortly after we spoke with this nice guy (did not catch name =( ) with our pizzas that were fresh from the oven. She even wiped our entire meal, which included my two beers and gave us the meal for free.

    "text": "The pizza was really greasy.  Ordered a create your own with mushrooms and it came loaded down, which might have been good except it that's all it was, mushrooms.  There was practically no cheese or sauce. The cheese pizza is surprisingly not boring with 3 different cheeses on it. The pizzas are big enough to share, if so desired. Hand stretched is a basically a thin crust pizza with a slightly raised crust. They serve Pepsi products and a wide variety of teas.  They offer patio dining which would be great if people with shopping bags and scooters didn't walk through it and bump everyone all the time.  While it was an ok pizza place next to fashion square we won't go back again.",

I sincerely thought we had been given the wrong soup. Potatoes and an assortment of other vegetables in a thick stew like brew. Noodles??? No...that was not visible. Broth...not there.   So I checked if we had the wrong soup. So... An ignorant ass waitress(???) came over and said \"we do not get our soup From a can\" like I am a stupid idiot who only knows Campbell's soup. Are you fricking kidding me?  You stupid idiot. I have eaten in more upscale restaurants in the U.S. And Europe than she can even pronounce their names.   I know food from one end to the other. That soup is not chicken noodle soup by any cook's standard. Was it bad??  No. But, it is NOT chicken noodle soup by anyone standards who knows how to cook.   This happened between 5:00 - 6:00 pm on Oct 25, 2015. I will NEVER return to this place due to one stupid, stupid person who represents Sauce.  My husband stopped me from getting in this idiot's face.   Love Fox restaurants. I am still so pissed and insulted from this experience that I sure as hell will never return to Sauce anywhere.",

    "text": "The concept of this place is fast casual, minus the fast part. I have been here several times due to its proximity to work but I find that the time it takes to get your food is not conducive to a work day lunch. They also do not offer pizza by the slice so if I am by myself grabbing a quick bite I go for a panini (which are just ok) and a side salad. They don't let you swap it for the chips so you have to pay extra for the salad and they don't let you get once of the \"fancy\" salads in a side portion.  Overall, I think the only time this place works is if you have some time to kill and a few other people with you so you can share a pizza and salad. But on those occasions I can think of half a dozen other places at the same price point that I would rather go to in the area with better food and ambiance. i.e. Fifth and Wine, Herb Box market, Olive and Ivy marketplace, Gelato Spot, etc. etc.",

My wife had a bad stomach ache later that night that may or may not be attributed to food born illness. I was disappointed with the chain's lack of high standards and may not eat there again.

Once I get back and open up the boxes I find out they gave us a completely wrong order!! We ordered the bruschetta and instead find a Caesar salad and instead of my turkey feta salad I find a different salad that I can't even eat because it has avocado in it (which I am allergic too). My advice is if you must order take out from Sauce, double and triple check it before leaving the store! But it's safe to say I will never be returning.",

The pizza came with arugula, mushrooms and truffle oil and was delicious. For you thin, crispy crust fans this is it! Crunch and thin crust with light vegetarian toppings! Very good and not too greasy or heavy feeling. The Broccoli Mac & Cheese was good, well cooked pasta, creamy cheese sauce and pieces of broccoli. Definitely a lot better than The Vig's, it wasn't incredibly rich which made for easy eating and definitely second rounds.  The place is casual, but appropriate enough for a meal shared between couples. The staff was very pleasant and made sure we were all taken care of! Definitely, gonna come back to satisfy my thin crust pizza cravings!",

I ordered The Italian Panini, my cousin had the Quinoa salad (not sure what it was called), and my other cousin actually ordered a pesto pasta (not on the menu, they basically take mac and cheese pasta and put pesto in it instead). My panini was good, but it was better refrigerated when I got home and got to add ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise and all that! ;p   I loved the banana peppers in the panini. My cousin's salad was alright, I'm not a huge fan of quinoa so I didn't care for it much but my cousin didn't like it too much- she didn't finish it or bother packing it to take home.   My other cousin finished her pesto salad, I tried some and initially I thought it was bland but she gave me another part of it which was super flavorful, so just make sure to mix it evenly throughout.   We got the pizza cookie for our free dessert and they used a vanilla gelato on top of our chocolate chip cookie that wasn't cooked in a little pan. It was delicious. Great service, as well. The food is delivered to your table and all the workers come up to check on you even though it almost is self-serve.   Had a great first time at sauce and the staff were patient and initiated conversation. The prices aren't too bad either. My panini was $8 but I can't remember the rest of the bill because I didn't pay attention, haha.",

They offer pizza, tasty salads, panini's, and pastas. I have only tried the pizza and salads, but I have been very happy with both. They also have a huge selection of wines to choose from.  The pizzas do somewhat remind me of Italian pizza, just a crisper crust. They have some very unique pizza flavors at Sauce. Last time I ate there we tried the  Rosemary potato, spinach, feta, and olive pizza. I was a bit hesitant about the potatoes, but it turned out to be really good.   I have to admit Sauce was a bit over hyped, but still the food is good and I really like the relaxed atmosphere!",

Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.    If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.",

    "text": "I genuinely like this place for a few reasons, and I keep coming back despite some small shortcomings, so it must be pretty good.  My good friend and I love to go here for our catch-up sessions over some lunch.  Its great because its easy, quick, something different than the norm.  Anyone I know I can take here for lunch or dinner run, and they'll probably find something they like or want to try.  The menu is pretty simple: pizzas, paninis, pastas and salads, and all are pretty good.  I will say, however, that sometimes they sound better than they actually are.  Some of the salads can be pretty bland, but the pizza and paninis are pretty good, just not fantastic.  All in all, the food selections are great; can't really say there is a bad choice in the bunch.  One thing I can say, I have a tendency to get the same thing often, and every so often a salad or panini will be notably less-than-stellar.  Despite the risk of get a bit of bad luck when ordering, on average, the food is very good.    The service is great considering it looks like a simple order and sit-down kind of place, where there are small extras that they provide, like people coming around and asking if they can fill your drink, or offering to clear your table, etc.  As well, the location is great (especially if you get lucky enough to catch a parking space in front of the restaurant, and the convenience is fantastic.",

The seating is very cafeteria like - similar to Pei wei or Chipotle - you place your order and take your number and drinks to your seat... someone brings you your food and they clear your table of empty plates.   The food has been very reliable and I love to eat here.   I'm not a fan of the seating and atmosphere though - the menu should drop a buck or two here and there to reflect the ambiance.   The place usually has a good amount of people in it and depending on the time of day, someone's brought their noisy kids in there. It's not as bad as peter piper pizza, but I think the rich parents shopping at fashion square or waterfront consider it as such when their kids start crying for pizza. It's also a hot spot apparently for teenage high school girls... much like Ra Sushi.   If the food wasn't as good as it is, I'd never go there again.",

But the ingredients seemed quality, and the salads and other dishes people in there were eating (sparse at 2pm on a Sunday) looked good, so I gave it a shot.  And I'm so glad I did!  To picky pizza people out there --thin crust here does NOT mean cracker crust.  (I hate cracker crust!)  This pizza has a woodfire quality edge with a middle-of-pie limpness of New York style pizza.  Pretty near perfection, in my book.  I had a pretty basic margharita pizza or something --perfect size for one (hungry) person.    We had fountain drinks but you can get beer or wine, by the bottle or glass.  Very casual interior, with some limited (but nice in the experience of a Chicago girl in the winter) outdoor seating.  Definitely recommend, especially if you are weary of cracker crust pizza like me!",

The mozzarella overtakes the salad and the croutons (while tasty) are too fatty for the salad. Mozzarella is definitely the most overpowering ingredient and there aren't a ton of tomatoes. It's still tastes ok, but it's not the same. So, I will continue to hope they bring the old one back!",

There's nothing really...bad about this place.  It may be consTrued as slightly overpriced given the fact that it's primarily used as a lunch spot but the quality of the food is good.  Two recommendations: 1.  Broccoli Chicken Cheese pasta if you are able to take a post-lunch nap. 2.  Roast beef panini if you aren't.  The pizza is definitely decent as well, service is prompt and fast especially given the fact that it seems like the entire city of Scottsdale descends upon the place like vultures between 12 and 1p.  Bottom line - between Culinary Dropouts, Olive and Ivy, and the greasy mall food (with the new exception of Pita Jungle!), there aren't a ton of options and Sauce may just be your best bet.",

She only knew of the one in Mesa but I stumbled upon this one while out for a ride on my bike, motor-less. Decided to take her there for a couple reasons a) cuz she's pretty cool and b) cuz if I don't like it I can totally rip on her and her tastes.  But dang! I really loved this place! So what if I'm in search of the best pizza in a city new to me? This pizza was so good I couldn't even bother comparing it to my fave 'back home.'   We split a chicken caesar salad. The dressing was tasty and I really enjoyed the pulled-style all white chicken. Then onto the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I loved how thin and crispy it was, the pepperoni was of really exceptional quality but it literally comes down to the sauce. Yeah, it's not just a catchy name for the joint; it makes the pizza!  My only complaint would be the selection of beer. Wine is becoming more and more accessible and I can totally get on board with the idea of wine and pizza or wine and just about anything else, but sometimes I want a beer. They have maybe 6 brands of beer and some are totally appropriate, such as Peroni. I just would like to have seen a bigger selection.  And I think someone else has mentioned the fact that the restroom is very small; True. It wasn't crowded when we were there so I think I'd be pissed if I'd been drinking and it was crowded and I did need to go. Other than that, I really dig this place and can totally see myself going back for a casual dinner or even making the little trek for lunch.",

I've had pizza in Italy (Rome, Tuscany, Umbria, etc) and love it there; I'm always disappointed by the pizza here in the US, and have only found a few places in the entire country that do what I consider to be a good crust; 'Sauce' manage to get it right! (the other fabulous place in the US is 'Pizza Antica' in Lafayette, CA).    I don't understand another reviewer complaining about the amount of meat in the pizza; pizza is not about piles of meat, it is about a combination of ingredients - a perfect balance.   The pastas and salads are also absolutely spot-on - every salad and pasta I've had has tasted fresh and has good ingredients. My only complaint about Sauce is that you can't sit outside and drink beer!  On a warm summer's evening, you must sit inside (in the over-cooled air) rather than sit at a table outside.  I know this is due to some local city rule, but still - has prevented me from going there more than once.    The pricing and service are also extremely good.",

The Caesar pizza is delicious and perfect on a hot summer day. Just filling enough, but not to the point where you'll need to roll out of there. Also great is the Artichoke and Portobello mushroom pizza. The pizza is perfectly covered with juuuust enough cheese. The mushrooms and artichokes are perfectly placed.   I think the pizza sauce is key. Hence the name I'm sure. :) Not too salty or acidic, but full of tomato flavor. No chunks, and nothing to get stuck in your teeth.

We ended up trying it again today because the place we wanted to go to was packed and it was too hot to walk. The toppings on the flat bread that we used to love were microscopic. The avocado on our favorite salad was tiny as well.  There are much better options around, so I'm afraid today was our last visit.",

The menu offers a nice, but not large, selection of interesting pizzas and salads, plus a trio of lasagna offerings. We opted for a potato rosemary pizza, mozzarella and tomato salad and a chicken walnut salad. All were truly yummy ~ the pizza being my absolute favorite. I was surprised that the tomato mozzarella was lettuce salad. The pizza is served on a light crust, so not overly filling. Mom and I also indulged in a good glass of pino grigio. Total tab: $30.  The one hiccup in the place was service-oriented. This was the day after Christmas, so the place was packed. We ordered our food and drinks, but were told there weren't any seats available inside, and that our wine was not allowed on the outside patio. I asked the guy taking our order what he suggested we do, and he said we should not get the wine. Now, this was a mother-daughter shopping day, and we were going to have a glass of wine ~ we were actually thinking about going somewhere else when a manager-looking type said he had found a two-top for us. It was a cramped table, but we appreciated his service, and would only suggest finding a better solution than \"don't get the wine\" for future lunch and dinner goers.",

    "text": "I stopped in Sauce today for lunch to take a break from shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square...it was a great choice.  Sauce is a good place if you want lunch while you are out shopping, but don't want typical mall food court options.  It's similar to a place like Pei Wei, where you place your order at the counter and your food is brought to you at a table.  I ordered the grilled cheese panini (mozzarella, fontina and cheddar), a slice of cheesecake, and a glass of Riesling.  My total was $15 for those three items, so not too bad at all.  The sandwich was delicious...the cheeses were melted together perfectly and they all complimented each other very well.  The cheesecake was nothing spectacular...not bad, but not amazing.  My friend's salad looked delicious, so much so that a woman came over and asked her about it.    My only two negatives about Sauce are: *the wine list was a bit lacking for a place that says it's a pizza and wine place...I think there was only like six choices or so for wine. *you can't take your wine outside, according to the guys behind the counter. So if you want to eat outside, don't order any wine.  We saw people outside drinking beer, so I'm not sure what the complete story is.",

Located in the heart of the \"waterfront\" district in Scottsdale (yeah it's just a canal, and you can't see it from Sauce or most of the district in the first place, but it's the desert ok?), the unchain chain (it's a Fox Restaurant Concepts venue) does a nice job of good food at reasonable price and with pretty good speed.  Service is still a bit in training mode - but it did just recently open.  With a simple wall menu and pricing scheme, there is a large selection of thin crust pizzas - the kind you truly get in central and northern Italy.  While the cheese pizza I had was excellent, there were some nice mildly exotic offerings as well.  The beef lasagna was, for the price of $9, also a very very good choice.  While there was nothing wrong with the salad ordered (sorry - I think is was their Chicken and ? salad)  the order taker didn't know what type of lettuce (mixed) and it was way to light on dressing.  Good - but I wouldn't drive there for it.  Italian beer (Moretti's - yum) was nice.  The wine by the glass was not  special.  Chintzy retro-ish juice glasses were used, the Pinot Noir (only 1 selection per category) was ok.  But to get a 2nd glass I also had to go back up to the counter.  Even though it's a counter order system where they then deliver the food to your number & table, it still seems they should go the extra step for additional orders of food and drink.  Soda was one of those all you can drink fountains.  But for a bill of $45 with tip for 3,in the heart of Scottsdale, it's definitely  a place I'll stop in again if it's \"quick, casual, simple and tasty\" that I'm looking for.  Cheers",

    "text": "My only disappointment w/ Sauce was that while the food was good - it wasn't as great as the menu's hyped it to be.  Why would I mention that first?  Because after reading the menu online I was WAY into the place (expectations up), then I read the reviews (expectations slightly down, but still high), I then heard rave reviews from a friend (shooting expectations up) so I suppose I was expecting something above and beyond what I got.  Mind you - it was still pretty good.  I'm actually looking forward to making the trip again.  My sandwich was good - though I hardly tasted any pesto and my cheese was not melted (On a pannini - it should be melted) - but not amazing.  The pizzas looked great and I'm anxious to try one.  Soup and salad was good, but quite simple - nothing outstanding once again.  That said, great location, good parking.  We were one of only 2 other tables at 11:30 but by 12:30 when we left the place was packed so my advice is to go early or late if you want a really good experience.    Though it's been stated that it's a \"order at the counter\" kind of place, folks regularly came around to pick up extra plates and provide drink refills which was a nice unexpected touch.  It's a nice option for lunch - but it's also in an area of many Good, Nice, Great and even Amazing lunch spots.  So while there are \"better\" spots to go in the area, this isn't ever going to be a bad choice - especially during non-peak hours.",

I will not return back to this place.",

She then followed up again with a private message that addressed my concerns, her dedication and pride in the location was clear and this was in itself a relief after my incident. I believe that any bad situation can be quickly rectified if the reaction that follows is handled with compassion. I'm sad that it took a bad review to have someone listen, but I adore the food here too much and don't want to see a couple of bad apples ruin it.  Mistakes will be made, but it can all be fixed with a heartfelt apology. Thank you Abbie for really caring and I'm very impressed with how quickly my concerns were addressed... Thank you Lauren. I am changing my review and open to changing my opinion on dining in versus to go. Fingers crossed my next experience is better.",

They changed from a shell noodle to a spiral noodle and had little cheese in the dish, needless to say I get why that person tweeted about it. Such a disappointment for a dish that used to be a staple for me there.  Otherwise, the food is good. Haven't had a salad or a pizza I didn't like.  It's winter so I understand they had the heater running, but it was uncomfortably warm. After ordering our beers and food and walking away, the cashier yelled after us that we can't take alcohol on the patio- would've been nice to know when I was ordering my beer so I wouldn't have had to sit in a sauna.",

Their Pasta and Meatballs is not a tradional spaghetti and meatballs or even angel hair pasta, instead it's the macoroni sized pasta. Which I am not a big fan of, when I want pasta and meatballs I don't want the tiny pasta.  Also only Italian place in the world that doesn't serve garlic bread, that's like McDonalds with no fries. Instead you get a French bread roll with no option to add more bread to your order.   Tonight I tried the pizza.....so bland.  The crust was weak and thin, zero taste in their tomato sauce and the cheese barely covered the slice. Honestly Dominos is better tasting.  I made it through 3 pieces before tapping out.  I might as well eaten toast with shredded cheese on it.   I will say the pizza looks good but it's not.  And the toppings did not help either.   Barely covered a slice and also super bland tasting.  Maybe their other food is good but they failed at the two most basic Italian foods, pasta and pizza!!",

Having driven past and seen only the \"Pizza Wine\" description, I thought this was a fancy Italian restaurant, as most are.  I found the menu to be quite compelling: a wonderful mix of unusual ingredients, freshly made.  And the style of service reminds me just a bit of Chipotle (one of my favorite fast food restaurants).  Meaning, the food is fresh, good, and reasonably priced.  And the restaurant is clean and modern without being fancy.  I am unable to give five stars only because I have only been here once.  (I haven't tested the consistency of the restaurant yet.)  There is much more that I want to taste, so I will definitely be back!",

Your end product will be worthy of 5 stars in addition to being cheaper and tastier than the pizza at Sauce.   This place is just mediocre. I've eaten homemade pizzas, frozen pizzas and food court pizzas that have tasted better. Leave it to the cunning Mr. Fox to create a seen and be seen, trendy, fast food pizza joint in disguise located in Scottsdale. Go figure.   I'm not saying Sauce is awful but it's definitely not a place that I want to go back to. The pizza (actually just the food in general) was disappointing. Especially the pizza, as the crust was more like a crispy, greasy cracker sprinkled with parmesan cheese.   There are two reasons why I gave Sauce three stars instead of two. Number one is because I really liked their Sangria. For $5 I got a huge glass that was very delicious and strong. Number 2 is that I really like the concept. Fast, cheap pizzas and salads are all great things! However, these things are not great when they just taste OK. The food at Sauce needs some improvement.   To sum it up - I don't recommend Sauce as there are much better chain type places near the \"waterfront\" in Scottsdale... but if you must go here it isn't horrible, it's just alright.",

I had trouble deciding on which one to buy, so I got a create your own pizza. On my pizza, I added artichokes, prosciutto and fresh basil. I was pretty excited because I love artichokes and basil and the restaurant smelled really good! I ordered my pizza and walked next door to Urban Outfitters while I was waiting. (By the way, this is the sort of restaurant where you order your food and then either find a table or take it to go.) The pizza was ready in about 10 or 15 minutes.   Overall, I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with the pizza I had at Sauce. I love the fact that the pizza is thin crust, but it was a little overcooked, so some of the edges were a bit burnt. The toppings weren't plentiful; I couldn't even tell there was basil on the pizza. Maybe my expectations aren't fair but when I order artichokes on pizza, I expect them to be a little bigger than they were here. The artichokes were tiny little pieces of artichoke, I could hardly see them. Sauce and cheese, however, had good flavor! Maybe I have to try a different pizza. A girl in line recommended the caesar salad pizza.",

I'm not sure if it is coincidental or not, but it seems as though the food has gone downhill since that transition took place.  I always order the quinoa salad with salmon, and the past few times I've ordered it, the salmon is more like dry, crunchy salmon jerky instead of the tender salmon they used to serve.  My coworkers have made similar observations about their food since the transition - dry salmon, food is bland, pizza has less toppings.  I also have to agree with another reviewer's comment about the brown haired guy at the counter.  He is the worst!  I have been coming to this location 1-2 times per week for almost two years now, and I order the same exact salad to go.  Yet every time I walk up to the counter, he gives me the same blank stare like he has never seen me before, asks my name and what I would like, and says, \"For here?\"  You would think after interacting with someone 100+ times, one might memorize at least one of those details.  Anyway, I was willing to put up with him when my salad was tasty, but I may have to take Sauce off of my lunch list if the food does not improve.",

I went a second time and got pizza.  Maybe its my fault for going to a place called \"Sauce\" but I didn't know they took the name so seriously and literally covered the pizza in sauce with no cheese.

They give you a number tent for your table and you wait for the server to bring your food. Service is friendly.  They give you cups to get your own beverage.  I like this concept...it's casual, quick, and not really full-service either.  The food was pretty good, I had the chopped chicken, pinenuts, gorganzola salad. It's not a HUGE salad, just a good size portion (maybe the size humans really should be eating???). We also had Mac & Cheese and a pizza...good food here.  The lunch special was a good deal (there are 3 versions): ANY chopped salad, side of pasta, and a beverage for $7.50.  I think the cheese pizza was $8.75...(crust is thin) fresh basil on it...yum!

I opened their front door anyway, and asked if they were still serving. They said \"No,\" so I turned around and walked out as I had expected. Then about 10 seconds later, another person working there chased after me and said \"Hey, maybe we can help you, what are you ordering & we'll see if we can still make it.\" I was getting a pretty simple chicken salad to-go, so they said it wouldn't be a problem, and they'll have it ready for me as quickly as possible.

    "text": "Why isn't this place rated 5 stars.  I have lived across the street from this location for about a year and ordered for the first time on Saturday.  I split the roasted veggie salad with chicken and a cheese pizza with a friend.  First off- everything was AMAZING.  The salad was big with a lot of veggies but the part I was even more impressed with is you get to add chicken for $2 and it's a generous portion.  I loved it SO much that I ordered it to go last night for dinner.  The pizza is also very good.  It's a thin crust pizza that doesn't get soggy in the middle with great flavor.  (Even though it was just cheese pizza- it was still very good).  I'm going to be a frequent customer now!  THANK YOU SAUCE!    I'll be ordering this salad pretty soon I'm sure, so photo to come!",

For the salad we had the Italian salad which was absolutely amazing probably one of my favorite salads I've ever had and it was a good portion definitely big enough for 2 to share. As for the pizza we tried the pig pizza which consisted of bacon, salami, pepperoni on a nice thin crust which was also a good size and tasted great . For dessert we decided to try the pizza cookie which consists of a triple chocolate chip cookie baked to order with a large scoop of ice cream on top . If you aren't full and have the urge for dessert this will hit the spot.  Now on to the service , we were greeted immediately when we walked in the door and the cashier was quick to take our order and explain some items since this was are first visit, the great service didn't stop here we got our fountain drinks which were self serve and sat down I would say that probably within 2 minutes are salad was brought to our table and maybe a minute or two after that our pizza was brought so definitely super fast service as well as very polite and friendly staff who cleaned off the table and came by to see how everything was , Kudos to everyone at this location for such a great experience and I will definitely be back to try some other items.",

All it was was pasta with a wicked small dose of a watered down sauce on the bottom of the container with absolutely NONE staying on the pasta. Furthermore, I ordered & paid for it with meatballs & sausage.  The meatballs are hard as rocks due to no doubt being frozen store bought vs fresh that they simply microwaved & tossed in for show = inedible!  As for the sausage, well there wasn't any. Probably for the best as god knows what that woulda been.  I HIGHLY recommend NO ONE eat at this restaurant if this is what they choose to send out of the kitchen.  Well, This is supposed to be Mac & Cheese with meatballs & sausage.  Looks more like a kids meal from a a school cafeteria, albeit I'd bet the school cafeteria would taste better.  Can anyone find cheese in this, or sausage??? I know I couldn't.",

All the ingredients are chunky, from the \"croutons\" to the tomatoes. The mozzarella is very creamy and tender but it's cut too large. There also wasn't enough balsamic in the dressing, overall lacked flavor. I'll have to find a new go-to salad.   The pepperoni and mushroom pizza on hand tossed crust was every pizza lovers dream. The crust had the perfect chew to it and the fresh mushrooms put it over the top.   My husbands favorite was the spicey chicken sausage pizza. It's spicey but not over powering. Also comes with green chili on top which adds a flavor level that brings it all together.   We like the hand tossed over thin crust option, the hand tossed provides more of the American pizza taste/feel.   Current seasonal salad is watercress and radish with goat cheese.",

It was the chicken and pine nuts and a mild Gorgonzola dressing.  It was really good.  Loved their choices for ice tea - three varieties.   Great service, clean restaurant, but a little noisy (it wasn't that busy).    My friend ordered a pizza which looked amazing.

They cater to different dietary needs/trends, so they also offer gluten free crust as well.  I like to play it safe when it comes to pizza and I'm usually happy with anything that's even remotely similar to a pepperoni pizza, so I usually have the Suprema pizza (which includes sausage, red peppers, red onions, and mushrooms), which is about $12 and can be split between two people if you're not totally famished. They also offer a Build Your Own pizza, where it starts out at $9 and each additional topping is a bit extra.  I've also had the chicken, spinach, and apple salad for $9 which is also pretty tasty and can be split between two people  as well. If you really want to get the most out of your experience, I'd definitely recommend getting a pizza and salad to split between two people.  They also offer other food items such as soups, paninis, and pastas (though these really aren't the main stars at this type of restaurant in my opinion). Either way, you're in old town and you've got some pretty cool areas just outside the restaurant that are fun to visit.",

I had never heard of Sauce before but we liked the idea of pizza/pasta and wine.   We gave it a shot for lunch and were not disappointed.   Sauce is very much like a Chipotle atmosphere, you walk in pick your item off a menu posted on the wall, order and then sit down the best part was the customer service!  You are normally expected to get up and get your food when its ready (in a low key environment like this) but they brought it to our table. We also received bread which was unexpected. The attention to detail that the team gave to us was very unexpected but much appreciated, even during their busy lunch hour.  The food options were creative, it gave you the opportunity to try something new. We tried the Rosemary Potato Spinach, Feta & Olive Tapenade Pizza and were not disappointed. We also got the Vegetable Salad with  (Carrot, Asparagus, Cucumber, Corn, Tomato, Parmesan & Avocado). It was a very generous portion, fresh and very good. We had planned to split it and it was just perfect to do so, it was definitely not a pathetic looking mini salad that you often find at a quick restaurant atmosphere.  We definitely enjoyed our time there and for a quick inexpensive bit to eat it hit the spot!",

Me and the Mr headed over to Sauce after our reservation for Digestif fell through (thanks guys!). We were very animate about supporting the Dining for Life cause so this was the next best thing.. well, maybe those are a poor choice of words. The thing is we didn't want to drive all the way to downtown Phoenix.. so since there were only a handful of places..   Anyway, I have never been a fan of Fox concepts.. mediocre food set into sort of cool spaces. Sauce is no different.. sort of cool industrial interior, down beat music and wine only 5 bucks a glass. The concept is great its just that the food is terrible on all levels. From the salad with next to no toppings.. to the shitty Totino's style pizza (yep, ate that shit when I was a kid) to the horrible pannini. Seriously.. the food is so simple you think it would be great.. its just doesn't work.. I think the ingredients are to scant and the quality is so so.   I gave one star for the lasagna which didn't suck as bad as I thought and the staff.. the staff is very friendly and attentive. Now if the food was better, well, I think we'd have a winner.",

They have a new thicker hand-stretched crust, which is pretty good if you're offended by their normal thin crust. The hand stretched also appears to be a little larger, and is more filling than the thin crust, so it's good to share.  The white bean and potato soup is the reason why I only try to come here on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Yes, it is THAT good.  The pasta, salads, panini's are all good too. And they have a decent wine selection.   In the summer they offer great dinner deals. I believe last summer was a pizza, a salad and 2 glasses of wine for $20. Seriously, thats a steal and a half dot com.",

It's a wonderful place for a quick lunch - but this is not a place I would frequent for dinner due to atmosphere and menu choices, hence the lower rating.  If you're a fan of the walk up and order establishments, this would be a prime contender.  Now for the food!  I'm not a huge fan of their pizzas.  They taste great with gourmet ingredients - thin crust, but there are so many other pizza joints I would suggest first.  What I do love and highly suggest are their salads.  I think my favorite would have to be the caprese, which is actually a standard salad with lettuce, pieces of tomato and fresh mozzarella mixed in, an amazing balsamic vinaigrette, and to top it off... lightly crunchy buttered/oiled croutons made from their fresh bread.    My second choice salad is the chicken/gorgonzola/tomato/pine nut one.  Fresh light dressing makes this a summer time delight.    Their bruschetta is also great, but expect them to be small in portion, very individual, not shareable as an appetizer really.  Great flavors!  Paninis and pasta also are a large portion of the menu, but alas, I have not tried any of these yet!  In all, a great place to grab a quick bite with good food aimed to please.  If you're familiar with restaurants like Noodles n Co or Cosi, this is right in line.  Not quite what I expected from a FOX creation, but yummy.  p.s. their triple chocolate cookies (plain cookie dough, dark, milk, white chips) are way worth $1 more.  Make sure to take advantage of them because I am addicted even though I don't really love chocolate!",

Be forewarned that while you can order alcoholic drinks, their liquor license does not permit drinking on the patio. You have to keep your party indoors.  I went in with three other people. Three of us got the chicken and broccoli pasta and one got the meatball panini. That panini was the best thing on the table. The interesting thing about the pastas was that two of them were cold -- room temperature at best. The other one was blazing hot. I'm not sure what they do with their chicken here, but it has the taste and texture of canned chicken. They also ran out of wine glasses during our visit. When we ordered our second round, we were told we had to wait for clean glasses. We all finished our entrees and the glasses still weren't ready. Had to get a refund. Super disappointing.

We ordered from our hotel room which was a couple miles away and then looked for parking in the garage. I'm sure by this time it was a good 12 minutes from when we ordered. A family of 4 was 2 ahead of us when we entered, rather than walking up to take out register we just waited; now we are a good 15-17 mins in fromm ordering. Once we got to the register we paid and was told it would be a couple mins. Needless to say, the family of 4 was well into their meal of pizza, salad, Mac and cheese when I went back to the register to find out where our food was. No apology, not even a look of care. I eat Sauce 1-2 times a week, but I will not be back to this location.",

    "text": "Upscale \"fast\" food.  We're creatures of habit and order the same meal during most visits. The macaroni and cheese, bruschetta and a mixed green salad and a few drinks. The salad and bruschetta are mostly consistent when ordering. The macaroni and cheese is never consistent. Sometimes the pasta is way over cooked other times just right. Sometimes the pasta swims in a runny cheese sauce, other times its coated just right. You never know.   We've been going to this location for little over a year now. It's conveniently located within walking distance of our house. Today was perhaps the first time we received friendly and fast service.  From the cashier to the person collecting our plates, everyone seemed friendly and happy to serve. It almost seemed weird because I've gotten used to the fairly crappy snotty behavior of the kids working there.    It was also the first time ever our whole meal was served within a few minute period. On all previous occasions, one dish would come out, then 20 minutes later another, and on many occasions you had to ask someone where your food was. Today, it was smooth running. Perhaps they did some much needed house-cleaning and hired new staff. Keep it up please!",

I had to go up to them 3 times let them know we were ready for the check...(bummed out) I have to give the establishment a 3 star, I would comeback but probably on a day where the staff is switched up.

I locked my keys in my car as I was coming to pick up my order and they were more than accommodating! They were happy to keep my food in the warmer until I was able to get in my car, offered me something to drink and even cookies (it was impossible to say no).   Most places would have just forgotten about you once you paid but they made sure to make feel welcome and even took the time to let me know that even though they were closing, I was more than welcome to stay until the locksmith got here. This place is great and I ended up devouring my lasagna before I left, it was delicious!!",

    "text": "Initially I loved this place, but after going here regularly for work, the novelty wore off kind of quickly. The pizza's good, but doesn't compare to a lot of other places in the area. I know it says \"Pasta & Meatballs\", but I always think that's going to be spaghetti, and I'm thoroughly disappointed when it's not. I thought I'd try the \"chicken caesar & parmesan pizza\" to go out of curiosity. I don't know what I expected, but they gave me some pizza bread--Yep, a pizza but with nothing on it, and, completely separately, a chicken caesar salad. MAYBE I'm the crazy one and I expected too much, but I didn't expect to have to assemble my own food--especially something that is already IMPOSSIBLE to assemble. What the actual hell? I pretty much just stuck with the turkey and fontina panini from then on, but even then, it just got kinda boring. I wish I could love this place as much as I initially did, but now, in my mind, it's very mediocre.",

The restaurant was not too busy and I get to the line (and the chalkboards overwhelmed me) - so I decided to order based on memory.  I ordered the gluten free pesto chicken pizza and the boyfriend got the meatballs with pasta.    We sit down and the meatballs and pasta came first - it was ok.  I was hungry so I snatched a few bites.  The pizza came and it was way overcooked.  An employee saw my pizza and asked me if the pizza was ok - maybe bc she noticed how brown it was.  I really didn't fuss about it since I was starving and I really didn't want to wait for another one.  At the end of the meal, I was a little disappointed.    Sauce just doesn't do it for me anymore.",

I placed a simple order (salad, and Mac & Cheese) and was told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later and still had to wait another fifteen minutes. While waiting, I noticed that the manager was going around and asking other people, who also ordered for take out, what their orders were. It was pretty obvious that they were understaffed and it's likely that the orders aren't placed until you actually arrive in the restaurant.   UPDATE: I took the rating down to one star because upon arriving at home with my food I found out that they forgot to put turkey on their Turkey and Feta Salad... They forgot one of the ingredients that is in the name of the dish.",

I made it a point to make it before I left mostly just because its a FRC and I love all the other ones. Not sure why I didn't make it before.   Went for lunch with two friends. Jags and I ordered two different pizzas that we both wanted to try and then split each of them down the middle. Evan got another pizza and traded us each out a piece so we all got to try three different pizzas.   I got a pepperoni and basil. Jags got spicy chicken sausage, and Evan got something else, can't remember. Anyway, they were all pretty solid. I like the crust, they definitely do the brick oven thing. The sauce as you might guess is good as well. You can tell they use high quality ingredients.   Those three pizzas were the only things I ever tried but I'm guessing their other stuff wouldn't disappoint. They move pretty quick in there too.",

I can't remember which. About 15 minutes after we ordered a man came out and said that they were out of the dough that we ordered and asked if they could make us something else. We agreed. When they brought the pizza they gave us coupons for two free meals the next time we were there.  The pizza was decent. I thought it had good flavor but was pretty greasy.  I also got a side salad that was fine.  I appreciate the friendliness of the service but I probably wouldn't return.
