I had an appetizer and the chicken main course and my boyfriend had the shrimp appetizer and steak entree, so we had a wide variety of options, all of which weren't the best.   Next time I would go and sit outside just for a drink and MAYBE an appetizer.",

To top this off the food was no where near its past reputation. What a shame. We will not be back",

The dinner was unbelievably good.  I've written over 100 local reviews this year and this meal was one of the top 3-4 of 2010.  To start with I had the peekytoe crab cake.  This baby is huge and perfectly crisp on the outside and loaded with delicious moist crab on the inside.  It is served on a bed of avocado and a delicious sauce.  I woke up still dreaming about this dish the next morning.  The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and the grilled asparagus, potato gratin and mac and cheese sides were fantastic.  Another highlight was the unbelievably good carrot cake.  It was presented as a work of art on the plate and tasted just as good as it looked.  Paired with great wine and superior service, this was a meal for the ages.  These guys are pros at J&G.  Make sure to get here as often as your budget will permit.",

Not the best I've ever had, but NOLA and Boston and NYC have spoiled me. These were quite nice, though.  Next up was the beet and goat cheese salad (such a sucker for that flavor combo!) and it did not disappoint!  The steak and broccoli were superb, and the dessert of granny smith apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream was a perfect ending.   A couple of Maker's Mark Old Fashioned's to wash it all down - I was definitely a happy camper.  I'll definitely add this to my \"special occasion\" list of places to go - it was a perfect and lovely evening!",

He was great.   However, this last visit was very different. The hostess  was cold and impersonal (and acted irritated when I requested a table by the window). The waiter was aloof and the food was disappointing. The calamari was not as tender as the last time we were there and had 3 clunks of fried dough in the bowl. The side of mushrooms has also digressed - slimy, bland and no herbs that made it pop. The crusted Halibut was cooked perfectly, but also bland (no salt, herbs or sauce - just a bare and unseasoned filet with a thin semi-soggy crust that kept sliding off. The Rhubarb Crumble was also bland (tasted pre-made like something off a food truck) and despite being told the Pistachio Ice Cream was homemade, it tasted store bought as well (like Bluebell). I only had a few bites and felt cheated. I could have went to Denny's for that dessert. I left almost all of it behind.   My date had the salmon and cheesecake. Same issues. Salmon was cooked perfectly, but had no salt or seasoning. The cheese cake was overly sweet and had a processed flavor to it.   Such a shame, because my first experience was so great. The view is still wonderful and overall ambiance is still inviting, but the chef is not consistent and seems to have a problem seasoning his food ('bland' was definitely the theme). Also, the wait staff is hit and miss (some great ones and some not so much), and the hostess we had acted like customers were an aggravation to her.   On a positive note, the Black Truffle Comte Fritters were still amazing. I can't get enough of them!",

    "text": "Simply delicious. That's how I describe J & G Steakhouse. Not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere is quite perfect as well! J & G Steakhouse sits atop the Phoenician and overlooks the Valley. Every seat in the house is excellent with a window view and it's a perfect setting for a romantic date or a special dinner. In addition to the dining room, the lounge is perfect to sit and enjoy a couple cocktails as well!   The food here is delicious and everything I would expect from J & G Steakhouse. We recently stopped by to try out the neighborhood menu special which is quite simply, a steal. For $39 a person, you order from a prix fixe three course meal that includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. I started with the split grilled shrimp salad which had a delectable dressing to go with it. For my entree, I enjoyed the flat iron steak with BBQ sauce. The steak was cooked perfectly and a tasty combination of tender and juicy. We ended up having a medley of dessert and each one was more delicious then the next! I decided that you really can't go wrong with any dessert here, or really any item from the menu for that matter, it all just depends on your taste bud's likings.   This is on the list of one of my favorite steak houses in the Valley and it's because of beautiful atmosphere and delicious food combined. If you have a loved one, want to woo a date or simply want to have a special night out on the town, I highly suggest J & G Steakhouse! For a more budget-friendly evening, check out their neighborhood menu from 5-7 PM nightly through September!",

    "text": "Our family spent a lovely Christmas through New Year holiday at The Phoenician several weeks ago.    Weeks before arriving at the resort we made reservations for Christmas Eve  at J & G Steakhouse on the property. At the time of the booking through Open Table, I alerted the restaurant that two people in our party required Gluten Free menus.  Upon being seated at our table we reminded the waiter about the dietary restriction of two of our guests. He said that there was no Gluten Free Menu but that the kitchen could probably be able to fix something that would satisfy their needs.    When rolls were subsequently brought to our table, I asked if they had gluten free rolls available. We had dined at the Terrazzo restaurant on the property the night before and were pleased that gluten free breads were baked fresh there each day. Our waiter rather testily replied that J & G's did not offer such fare and that if we had given them advanced notice of our dietary needs that they would have been able to have the appropriate bread for us.  The point is, the restaurant was notified several weeks prior when the reservation was made regarding the Gluten Free requirements. Furthermore, couldn't the waiter have sent someone from the large staff of servers that evening down the elevator and bring up some gluten free rolls for our Christmas Eve dinner?    Believe me, we will not go back to J & G Steakhouse ever again. We felt as if we were cattle herded in to be fed Christmas Eve dinner, then ushered out as soon as possible so that the next cattle could take our place.  I might add that our bill that night totaled near $500 for four adults and two children!!!",

We made a reservation through the website and included that it was our anniversary.  We arrived and self parked, which is a bit of an adventure with the required changing of elevators.  The restaurant is lovely and we asked to be seated outside.  The view is very nice and the atmosphere was pleasant.  Our waiter was excellent, sorry I didn't get his name, absolutely perfect service.  We chose the Restaurant Week menu which had an appetizer, entree and dessert for each of us.  I had the butternut squash salad, salmon and the apple crumble.  Quite simply some of the best I have ever had anywhere!  That salad was just incredible, I could have made an entire meal of just a giant one!  My salmon was yummy with some tasty Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes.  The apple crumble is so good you wish you were more hungry cause it's kinda big.  Husband enjoyed his shrimp, steak and chocolate cake as much as I loved mine.  They gave us a nice card and brought us complementary champagne too.   A lovely evening and we will be back!",

We sat a table inside the restaurant, but it was too cold for our 9yr old. So the lovely server fetched her a shall to keep her warm. It was so sweet of him to do that. The second server we met set us up with a table outside overlooking Camelback Mountain & the hotel's pool, which was breath taking! There were 2 fire pits outside & it was so beautiful. The food was out of this world! I had a bone in filet mignon, daughter ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and my hubby ordered the lobster tail. The best sides were the asparagus risotto and the Yukon gold mashed potatoes! For appetizers you must try the jumbo shrimp cocktail the east side oysters which were so scrumptious! I could've eaten them all day. This restaurant is gorgeous! The staff go over & beyond to make you happy & so effortless! Every single one of them were in a good mood & so hospitable. Our server was Kandice (hope I spelled it correct), Chris and 2 others that helped out. They work as a team and make sure we are all satisfied and happy. One last thing, try the cheesecake & the chocolate lava cake. You will never want to leave because the food & staff were so amazing & out of this world! Thank you to everyone there! I highly recommend trying this place while in Arizona.",

(and I was going to get the FTR), but there were no outdoor tables when we arrived, and while the menu was appealing, sitting inside was not, so we decided to head back to J & G to give them another shot.  We lucked out at J & G and were given a prime table outside with incredible views... it was me, Jared, my brother, and my parents, and it was a beautiful night!  I was exhausted as I came from an afternoon of drinking and hanging out at both the Giants Spring Training game and The Lodge... but I woke up for the meal that was ahead of me.  I drank water but my dad went for the Elderberry Specialty Cocktail and really enjoyed it and my mom had a couple of drinks too... oh, and my bro had a Steamworks beer!  Justis was our server again, and we had several other staff members catering to our every need including an extremely friendly GM.  The fresh bread was better than I remembered from our previous visit.  I started with the wedge salad (and so did my dad and brother).  We were all extremely pleased as the salads were chilled just right, the lettuce was fresh and crisp, and had the perfect balance of tomato, crispy bacon, and blue cheese dressing.  We also shared some appetizers for the table including Crispy Calamari, Parmesan Risotto, and Warm Beets.  I went with the Crab Cake for my entree... much better than the sea bass I had previously during my first visit.  Served with avocado, cucumber, and a sweet sauce, the serving size was plenty, and it was delicious!  The texture was crispy on the outside, and warm and creamy on the inside.  I also dug into the sides that we shared at the table including asparagus, creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms, and french fries that came with the burgers... (my mom, J, and Z had burgers).  My dad really enjoyed his Veal Porterhouse.  And as if we weren't full enough, we shared a few desserts.  My favorite was still the Carrot Cake and everyone else loved the Apple Tart.  And as I'm typing this review, I'm smiling just thinking about what a memorable night we had at J & G... I'm really happy we gave them another shot!  The other funny thing I'm smiling about is that I just wrote about the menu items we had and that I would recommend, and I think they are getting ready to change their menu... we were told they do so on a quarterly basis.  I just hope that the new Spring menu is as good if not better than the one we had on Friday.  And I hope that our future visits will continue to be five stars as well.    As the saying goes, \"you never get a second chance to make a first impression,\" but in this case, I'm glad we gave J & G a second chance - and I bet they are too... after all, I'm bumping my rating up from three stars to five!  Thanks J & G!",

We ordered wine from the impressive wine list and started out with the calamari as an appetizer. It was lightly fried and finished with lemon and some spices. Our group all opted for the filets, along with one selection of the Dover Sole. The service was good and attentive but without being too meddlesome.

I really didn't expect available reservations since I decided to make my reservation the day of - but I hit jackpot and they had 6pm on a Friday night available.  We were seated a few minutes after checking in up front.  The only problem I had with it was that I wish we were seated closer to the windows to see the sunset.  It was the perfect view though- just beautiful.    Our server was attentive and fabulous - always filled our drinks and came by every 5 minutes or so.  I had the pineapple mojito, which was deliciouso!   First course, I had the  butternut squash soup and it was thick, creamy, and yummy.  It wasn't too hot.  They also serve you complimentary buttery, toasted bread and it was so good!  I had to control myself and limit the bread consumption because with three courses, I'm bound to be full.  Second course came the Carmelized Flat Iron - that too was just full of flavor!  The portions were pretty generous for a classy restaurant like this - who knew? Obviously at this point, my mind is telling me I deserve to eat the last course, the dessert but my pants are telling me, \"For the love of God, woman, stop!\"  The warm chocolate cake with caramel ice cream came out and of course, I didn't listen to my stupid pants!  It was good...it really was.  Then I tried my bf's apple cobbler, and that was even better!  It was perfectly crusted and warm and off the charts!    Ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful, the food was impeccable, the service was outstanding, the check - $150 for two people.  You do spend a pretty penny, but I don't eat out like this much so here's to a \"Restaurant Week\" celebration!",

Any high end Steakhouse Chain is better quality than J&G.  We sampled a little bit of everything from bone in filet, bone in tomahawk rib-eye, lobster, and many sides and salads.  All were average in my opinion.",

The food portions were generous considering it was a tasting menu (6oz each fish and steak) and everything was well prepared.    The one thing was that the service in the bar area felt understaffed, and wait times were long to get seated, get a drink, water, etc.  But, that wasn't the end of the world.",

    "text": "Check in with the guard and he gives you the option of valet or park your own car. This is a courteous option but valet is the way to go if you have a date.  If you park yourself, it's an interesting adventure with the utility view of the Phoenician, along with leaking couplers, in the Phoenician basement.  It is also a easy misstep to get on the elevator, read the directions on how to get to the Steakhouse, then still do a misstep at the lobby floor. Yes, the directions are to get off the A/B elevators and change to the C/ D elevators.  The look about in the lobby is a TBT with a bit of 70's decor and several furniture pieces, along with the fountain, dating the hotel.  Jump on those elevators and the entrance to the steakhouse is impressive. The first impression is that it's a destination for drinks, and that is also my last impression.  Grab the Jinga matchsticks and the hostess seats you. We have an early dinner time thus we politely haggle for a table a bit closer to the view. Hey, the place is empty!   Table appears nicely set and the paper placemats appear organic. Wait until the end of the meal when the busboy crumbles the placemat like Denny's and dumps crumbs on the table.  Ah yes the food! Parker Rolls throw back to the hotel decor and actually are stale. The steak tartare is very good but ruined in presentation by serving in a bowl. It is suggested that a flat plate be used and flavorful dressing provided on the side or thickened up a bit and living up the plating. Steaks were underwhelming, especially compared to the competion in this town, and the smaller NY Strip was actually half the thickness of the larger order.  The smaller steak  was overdone for medium rare. Aside from salads, we cheap out with no sides for the meat entree. This option of ordering a la carte for the main dish feels like a stare down between the restaurant and your wallet (Hard to believe that veggies cannot be thrown in with the pricey steak.)  Service was stellar. Wine options reasonable and savagnon blanc chosen was yummy.  Left a comment card with email & phone but it still must be in a paper pile....",

Not sure who would order the burger among fine dining options offered just as I don't understand the couple each staring at 15\" laptops while seated with a panoramic sunset view. Maybe some are satisfied with sustenance and others expect an exceptional experience; either way, kudos for a valiant effort.",

The scallops were fine until squeezing the lemon that came on the plate with them, which had some sort of rancid chemical taste. So, half of us had to send back our meals. Did a manager come to apologize or check on us? Nope! Waited another 20 minutes before a human being came to the table again. Not our server but flagged down some girl working there, told her we wanted the check. Took another 20 minutes of just sitting there until that happened.",

There was no one really in the place (maybe 18 people if I'm being generous and including staff) and we met the manager, Patrick, through my friends who are regulars there. He came off a bit aristocratic in the, I'm much better than you kind of way, but you can never really tell what someone thinks. He definitely didn't smile or was just having a terrible night. Despite having had reservations for a while for a table with a view and there was no one in the place, they stuck us at a table far away from the windows; I guess they were reserving the many copious tables with views for ghosts we couldn't see? At the table, the waiter paid absolutely no attention to us. I wondered if it was because our table was a younger looking crowd or maybe they were executing Abercrombie & Fitch customer service style... you know the \"I'm too cool and you're not so we won't help you with anything and make you really wait for possibly inferior quality products and then make you wait to order food, dessert and check out despite being the only paying customer in the joint. Are they are having trouble? Was our money not green enough? No one will ever know and sadly I'll hesitate to go back.",

    "text": "Very disappointing. We went to the Phoenician with friends be able to site outside and enjoy the evening since the resort does have fabulous views of the Valley from patio beyond the lobby. We decided while there to have dinner at J&G. This is a beautiful restaurant also with great views of the Valley and can be a very romantic spot to dine with its dim lighting and soft live music. Also the service is good but that's where it ends. It is certainly overpriced for what you get. After reviewing the wine list we decided to stick with sparkling water. I've gotten Dr. Loosens Riesling in plenty of restaurants in the Valley but never have I seen it cost $48.00 for a 1/2 bottle (2 glasses according to our waiter) that alone is ridiculous. My husband and I had the chopped salad and I have had much better chopped salads, it was just mediocre at best consisting of a few greens, apple that could have been cut smaller and a few pecans on top and a little too peppery for my liking even the dressing was underwhelming. There was even nothing  special about the popover rolls and normally the bread is one of my favorite parts of dining out! I ordered an 8oz filet medium rare and it was almost medium well, they did take it back but it took quite sometime before the waiter returned with another steak by then everyone was done eating; at least it was medium rare this time. Their signature sauces were okay but really not necessary when you have a good steak. If this is such a great steakhouse they should have gotten right from the beginning. My husband and I shared the Brussels sprouts which were also nothing special, again it had a few pecans sprinkled on top. If I'm going to drop $200 on dinner there is no reason to return here when we have some great steakhouses like Mastros, City Hall Steakhouse, Dominick's, Capital Grille or Fleming's to just name a few in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.",

    "text": "I just wanted to write about my experience at J&G Steakhouse.  My mom is visiting from Wisconsin, and we wanted to take her out for a nice birthday dinner and were excited to take her to J&G. The lady at the check-in desk was wonderful, as usual, and welcomed us.  My husband and I have dined at J&G multiple times so she recognized us and was warm and welcome. I thought it would be a good indication of the rest of our time there, but that wasn't the case. Our waiter was really bad, when he initially came to take our order, we said we would need another minute; he came back approximately 20 minutes later.  Throughout the evening, we barely saw him, and toward the end of our meal, once our plates were cleared, and he knew we were finished and ready to go, we sat there for probably another 20-30 minutes waiting for our check.  It was so bad that we contemplated getting up and asking the front desk for our check instead. We came in right at opening, and it was not that busy. The worst part is he was focused on the table right beside us, and it was pretty obvious he was showing them preferential treatment. My husband and I asked the waiter if the chicken Parmesan were enough for my husband and I to split since we were already getting an appetizer, he said yes, so we did.  My husband's portion was not good at all, and he was surprised that J&G would serve chicken like it. He had the dark chicken thigh portion, and I had the white chicken, he said the chicken thigh tasted like school cafeteria meat and he could barely stomach it. I had to give him some of my white chicken, so he would not be hungry. The waiter never came to ask how our food was, and was so absent that my husband had to resort to drinking ice water throughout the rest of the meal because he never came to check on refills. My mom ordered a glass of wine, once that was gone, he never asked if she wanted another one. I asked for a window seat in my reservation, which I made weeks ago, and we weren't seated in front of the window. I have been planning my mom's birthday dinner for weeks since she is only in town for a short time, and I was really hoping J&G would go above and beyond my expectations, I will definitely be picking a different place next time. Obviously the new management that took over the Phoenician do not care about their customers.  I wrote them over a week ago with my experience and they never responded, the old management cared about the service they provided and if there was a problem, they reached out and did things to rectify the situation so they wouldn't lose customers.",

We went to celebrate my wife's birthday as J & G is her favorite restaurant. She and my son ordered the Dover Sole but after waiting some time the waiter came over and told us one of the Sole's had to be remade and would we like to get the one that is done to split in the meantime. My wife and son did not want that so we waited. When the soles came out my wife's was luke warm but she did not want to wait and send it back. I decided I was in the mood for chicken so I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. When it came out of the kitchen it was like shoe leather and did not taste good at all so I only ate half of my meal. I'm surprised the chef would have let that leave the kitchen. It was something that I would expect from a Denny's, not J & G. They did comp us on desserts and took the chicken off the bill.  I feel bad about giving a three star review but what transpired pretty much ruined my wife's birthday dinner. The waiter and service were excellent as usual.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place after having such a great time and fantastic cocktails during the Yelp Cocktail society.  Alas, the experience came out to be a 3 star average for me.  First of all, this place is beautiful on the inside.  As you walk in, you first notice that it is clean and modern with a sexy South Beach kind of feel to it.  I got the immediate feeling that beautiful people come here and stay and come back.  As you round the corner of the hostess stand, you see the spectacular view.  A beautiful view.  I'm still kicking myself that I had not come here before the Yelp Coctail society earlier this summer.  I recommend to anyone coming here to please go just before sunset so you can appreciate the stellar view this restaurant provides.  We were seated right by the window with a clear panoramic view facing southeast of the Valley.  We were greeted by our server and ordered a few drinks.  We were not in any rush, this was a b'day dinner/celebration for me, so it was a casual happy event for us.  This is where things kind of went down hill.....  The server must have had too many tables to wait on.  He had some support staff, but we waited for very long intervals between ordering drinks, appetizers and dinner.  I generally don't like that.  And my friend, who is not easily irritated, even noticed how long it was taking the server to come back.  So, we finally order our meal.  We decided to go for the 32oz bone in Australian Wagyu Ribeye for 2 that was to be sliced table side.  Cool,  a huge piece of meat, cooked Medium Rare.   We order the sides.  Our steak comes out and... its pretty much just shy of being cold.  Definitely not warm.  We are perplexed by it  to be honest, but one thing that worked in their favor, the time we waited to place our order... and with us both practically starving.. NEITHER one of us would have sent it back - at least the sides were hot!  ha!  so, I ate my steak and kept my mouth shut.  The steak itself taste good.  Just the temperature of it was wrong.  For dessert, they brought out the obligatory b'day cake.  A molten chocolate cake.  Unfortunately, that was the LAST thing I wanted to have.  I had had so much molten chocolate cake on my vacation the week before, that anyone else's cake would have HAD to be flawless for me to enjoy it, there's wasn't.  not enough chocolate and it tasted like it was not made with any salt.  Also it wasn't very sweet.  so... YIKES.    I'm giving them a 3 star review largely because I expect something better out of a restaurant in which 2 people spend $250+ on dinner.",

The night started great, the views are amazing, a nice gal served us wine and we chatted by the fire.  Great start huh?  All downhill from here.  We sat down at a table in the far back (it was my birthday and we requested  nice table, thanks).  The server took our orders and always seemed to need to rush off somewhere.   The appetizers came out, both were very good, Tuna Tartare was excellent.  Then the wait.  We sat and waited 45 minutes for the steaks to come out.  They were cold, just average and the grand apology I got was the waiter said, \"I can bring you more water while you wait.\"  Water?  Holy moly.  The manager walked by during dinner and asked my wife how things were, she said, \"not great honestly, its been a rough experience\" in a sweet tone.  He looked shocked like he'd never heard a complaint before and, frankly, we don't give them that often either.  We finished the meal and got the hell out of there, never to return.  The manager did comp our wine which was nice.  I recommend any of the other steak houses in the area, skip this one.  (City Hall, Flemings, Eddie V's, etc).

    "text": "This is the best value in The Upscale Steakhouse segment in the Valley. A couple of great pointers.. The Lounge overlooks the city, is amazing, start here with a drink.. Linger into the dining room. For $18 dollars, roughly the price of a small prime rib at Outback, You can have a USDA Prime Flat Iron Steak with Pomme Frittes, and a selection of some of the best sauces on the Planet.. Look into your lovers eyes, and go back into the lounge for dessert. For about 120 clams, you can have a fantastic destination dining event...  The atmosphere, service, and the food is incredible.Def in my top 3..",

The Server was abrupt and defensive. Different servers bringing side dishes were untimely. Salads were salty, the steaks were dry with no taste, side order of mushrooms had an odd taste, rolls were white bread, shrimp cocktail had small shrimp and each steak sauce (3) was worse than the next. The French fries were cold and the mashed potatoes were overly salty.  I was amazed that such a beautiful resort would have such inferior food and service. Other than the terrific ambiance, I can't think of one thing positive regarding the food or service. In total, this was an unbelievably BAD experience. They did take back the salad and fries however the server was argumentative that he sees the kitchen staff making the fries daily. Amazing........I am speechless.",

When I pointed this our to the head waiter--I think that what he's call--he thanked me for my negativity.  That really made me want to go back.  After a 20 minute delay we ate.  I think IHOP could have done better.  Diner for four  $350.00.  I'm allowed to be negative for poor performance.  Find another steak house",

While everything was very good, the total experience wasn't outstanding.  Service was the B or C plus team.  Everyone seemed as if they didn't want to be there.  True, it was Christmas Day.  Know it.  Got it.  We started with the calamari appetizer, which was great.  I ordered a pomegranate martini.  Our server returned and said they were out.  Really?  Run to the 7-11 and get some juice.  So, I decided on a lemon drop.  Then the drink runner could not locate us.  It was amusing to watch him go to every other table and eventually he found us.    The steamed shrimp salad was great.  Took a long time to be served.  Even our server asked another staff person what was taking so long.  The entree of filet mignon and gratin potatoes and asparagus was great.  All were cooked perfectly.  My filet had just enough pink in it and my partner's was rare, just as he likes it.  Desert was the warm chocolate cake with caramel ice cream.  All were excellent.  We're experienced diners and are really easy to please.  We don't look to find fault and problems at every turn.  It was just not the stellar experience others have described here.  I'm attributing it to the fact that it was Christmas Day, but if you can't give it your A game in service, you shouldn't be working on the holiday.  Overall, food was an A and service was C plus or a B.",

The place was hip.  Our waitress Sheena was so cool.  It was late already, but we were starving and wanted dinner.  So we tried the tasting menu.  It was excellent.  For $58 per person, it was worth every penny of it and more!  Every dish was so yummy, especially the Chilean Sea Bass in Yusu broth - we practically licked the plate!  The petite filet was cooked to perfection.  We got to sample different steak sauces, even though the steak itself was well seasoned.  And Sheena's service just made the whole dining experience great!  She was helpful and fun to talk to.  The next day we had our New Year's Eve dinner at T. Cook's at Royal Palms.  We paid double (or was it tripled?!) the price for just so-so food at T. Cook's.  At J&G we had better food, more reasonable prices, more hip environment and crowd, and excellent customer service.  Hope we'll get to go back again in the near future!",

    "text": "Located on the fifth floor at the Phoencian resort, J&G Steakhouse is a dark, open, sophisticated space. If your schedule is flexible, I would recommend dining around sunset to get that extra ambiance. However, even at 8 pm (that is the time we had reservations), the twinkling lights in the distance gave an extra romantic feel.  My husband and I decided to have a date night on Friday night, and we chose J&G since it was Restaurant Week and we had been wanting to try it. As most other reviews have said, the service is incredibly lacking and is only 2 stars. Luckily the food is exceptional and pretty much makes you forget how poor the service is that you are receiving.   We both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad, parmesan crusted chicken, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The caesar salad was very fresh and for an appetizer was quite large. The chicken was the highlight for me. You get two nice sized chicken breasts (I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large)...the chicken was so incredibly moist. Plus the parmesan crust on the chicken gave it an upscale fried chicken feel and had a hint of saltiness to it which I loved. The chocolate cake was sinful - once you broke into the cake, there was molten chocolate inside which was complimented perfectly by the ice cream. My husband loved all of his food (tomato soup, hanger steak with fries, apple tart) and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me (the fries were salty and delicious). With our entrees, we also ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were amazing. They were so smooth and had just the right amount of butter in them. I only wish the side had been bigger because we argued over who got the last scoop!  For a beer, two RW menus, and a side of mashed potatoes, our bill before tip came to $79 which we thought was great. For a nice, resort steakhouse, the prices on the regular J&G menu are incredibly reasonable and we are already planning another trip back to try more items on the menu!",

    "text": "This is definitely a special occasion type of place for us. We came for 4th of July because we heard they had great views and figured seeing some fireworks would be a certain possibility there. We were able to catch 3 or 4 shows, one really close by- along with the already wonderful view of the city and mountains.  Dinner was great- we went with the regular menu instead of the prix fixe. I had the Pimm's Cup cocktail- very delicious and refreshing. The steamed shrimp salad was surprisingly the best thing we had all night, it had tons of flavor for an unassuming little salad. We also got the corn ravioli and parmesan crusted chicken. The ravioli were not like any ravioli I've had before, paper thin dough filled with sweet corn and topped with a rich basil sauce. The chicken was super moist and served on a bed of buttery artichokes, although the parmesan crust was a tad  salty after a while.  And on to dessert! We couldn't decide between the classic chocolate cake and the carrot cake, so we got both :) The lava cake was excellent and beautiful. The carrot cake was as good as it gets, but the best part about this dish were the accompanying carrot-ginger sorbet and cream cheese ice cream- so delicious!  We couldn't finish the carrot cake and decided to take it home, so they boxed it up for us and gave us a token to hand to the hostess who would retrieve our take out bag for us... something we'd never seen before! Were they keeping it cold for us or something? Not sure...   Anyway, it was a really special evening out and absolutely recommend the place!",

For appetizer I remember having pate de foie gras with a sour green apple chutney. It was great. After that, I ordered the French Onion Soup, which was made perfectly; they weren't stingy with the cheese, and the flavor was dense. Maybe they used beef stock? Either way it was delicious.  Finally came the Porterhouse. It was massive and every bite was delicious. Accompanying it was a chipotle glaze which made the steak even better. The sides were also good, but definitely not the center of attention.  The second time was not as good as the first, but still great.  Whether it is a pricey venue is unimportant. It is worth any money spent. 4.5 stars.",

    "text": "Move over Mastro's!  Step aside Ruth's Chris!   The J & G has come to Phoenix and I cannot begin to tell you how impressed I am with everything at this phenomenal restaurant.  It occupies the space formerly known as Mary Elaine's on the 5th floor of the Phoenician Resort.   The brand new decor took several months of renovations and obvious attention to detail.  The sleek ultra  modern interior is warm and very comfortable.  Each table offers splendid views above the city.  It now rivals thae views of Elements which is on the other side of the mountain. The tables are large and very accommodating.  The seats are also big and roomy. Our party was first treated to a selection of their specialty drinks.  Loosely based on the classic, but with their own twists.  Followed by a few wonderful appetizers.  Unfortunately I arrived late and missed most of those.  What I did not miss was the 36 ounce Filet Mignon and a glass of delicious pinot noir.  I ordered mine Medium well because I do not like blood on my plate.  We all shared many sides- creamed spinach, aparagus, mac and cheese and potatos au gratin plus several others that never made it to my end.  Thats okay I was full anyway and ended up taking my filet home along with some seared peppers that really brightened up the already fantastice flavor of the meat.  I had two more meals in that To Go container.   The service was extremely polished and still friendly.  Our party was quite active and I am sure a little boisterous at times, but the staff at J& G made us all feel welcome and cozey.   This gorgeous place would be great for celebrations of any kind , romantic or otherwise.",

    "text": "This had the potential to be the best meal I have had this year and sadly it came way under par. I considered that perhaps I had built it up in my mind but everyone else at the table had the same feeling I did. So, with a heavy heart, I am going to say this meal did not deliver.   We arrived early and enjoyed a drink at the beautiful bar. There is not one bad thing I can say about the decor of this place. It is beautiful! Very modern and updated with incredible views of the city from the fifth floor of the Phoenician. The menu for glasses of wine is a short but satisfactory list. There is also an interested beer and cocktail menu.   When our entire party arrived (8 people for a birthday celebration) we were promptly seated. That is when things started to go down hill. Our server was very nice and attentive but the food was very overpriced and underwhelming. Phoenix magazine has their Cesaer salad listed as the best in the city. I informed the group of this and sure enough, everyone ordered it! It is made table side (totally unnecessary) but it was NOT what we expected! No one like it - it was entirely too lemony - and i felt guilty for even having suggested it. However, the French Onion Soup was delicious. We were only served bread once our appetizers arrived which I found odd, but no big deal. Our main courses arrived along with our sides, except for one. We had to remind the server to bring it. The sides are very small and really only meant for two people. So, it was difficult to share them with the table which was disappointing. I had the petite filet which was cooked medium rare just as I had asked. Unfortunately, it was not as tasty as I had hoped. It was not bad, but certainly not the best steak I had ever had. Simply mediocre. The mushroom side was salty and the potatoes gratin was good. I didn't get to try any other sides as they were too small to share with a table of 8. My boyfriend has the braised rib which the server had raved about. The meat was falling off the bone (good) but it was the sauces that really made it unappealing (bad). Some one got the lamb chops and felt they were good, but fatty. Two people really enjoyed their rib eye. Nothing but positive things to say there.   After our main course, I double checked with the server to make sure he knew it was a birthday. He did and said he would bring out something for him. So, to our surprise, the next time he came to the table, he brought the check and said, \"Have a good night.\" We were all very confused by this interaction. We wondered if the dessert was still coming or if he had somehow forgotten in the past five minutes. He said it was still coming (and it did with his name written in chocolate syrup which was a nice touch). At a fine dining restaurant, the bill should not be brought before we were done eating. It was very odd. We enjoyed the dessert (an apple tart thingy) and some sorbet before finally paying the bill and leaving.   Overall, it was a mediocre experience. Our server was very nice and he cannot make up for the food not being excellent, but I think we were all put off by the bill and him saying good night before we were even done eating. But, enjoy the ambiance while you are there.",

I would have liked them to be a bit bigger, but I was the only one that felt this way, maybe I eat too much?? I had the bone in porterhouse steak and it was pretty darn tasty. They serve the steaks with a variety of sauces to dip into, some of them were amazing, others were not. I would for sure recommend this place to someone looking for a 5 star dining experience. Make sure you bring your wallet cause this place is not cheap! Our meal was about $450 out the door for a table of 4. We ordered 3 apps, and 3 sides also and a bottle of wine. This restaurant is operated by Chef Jean George, I have no idea who he is, but the waiter and hostess both swear that he is someone to know. Judging by his cooking, I think I would get along just fine with him.  J&G is inside the Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, I was staying there so I figured I could add this place to my list of great American Steakhouses. My final opinion of this place, it is exactly what it says it is. They meet the B-Stew standard for a fine dining steakhouse. Also, there are great views of Camelback mountain. One last thing, the hostess at this place sold me on coming when I called for information. Very well trained and passionate about her job",

    "text": "I don't say this lightly at all, but honestly, this was the best steak I have ever had.  My husband agrees, and he's eaten a lot more meat in his life than me, so that says something.  But, first things first. We arrived on a Sunday night with no reservation, but got in straight away.  I had some doubts about the place just on principal as usually hotel restaurants are overpriced and underwhelming.  But we were staying at the hotel and too tired and had seen some pretty good yelp reviews, so we figure, why not?  The view was nice, augmented by a great firepit on the balcony.  The service was also excellent, everyone was friendly, helpful, and always there when you needed them, never there when you didn't.  Nothing snooty or condescending.  The crowd was mixed, which I'm assuming it usually is in Scottsdale.  Older retired types, daggy looking tourists from out-of-town, rich old guys with young girls with big fake breasts, people on business trips, etc.  I wouldn't call it trendy.  For food we ordered a cold lobster appetiser with aioli, which was excellent. We both had filet mignons with about three sauces on the side, as recommended by our waiter.  The steak was amazing, thick and juicy and tender and full of flavor.  The sauces, as my husband pointed out, were really not necessary, but did kick it up to the next flavor level.  We had a side of asparagus to share.  We are not huge eaters, so sharing a starter, ordering a small size steak each, and one side dish was enough.  If you are a bigger eater you might want to order your own starter and one side dish per person, as the steaks come with no sides.  We ended up sharing the apple tarte dessert, which was good.  The apples were a bit too sweet, but the cinnamon ice cream on the side was just spicy enough to balance the overly sweet apples.  Given the quality of the food I thought the prices were pretty fair. I\"d go back if I lived in the area, of if I come visit again.  Thumbs up!",

    "text": "We visited J&G at the Phoenician last night for dinner for the first time. I was not sure what to expect since this used to be the long time home of the ever pretentious Mary Elaine's. I could not envision this space as a steakhouse and was guessing it would be still be similar to Mary Elaine's. I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in and saw that it had undergone quite a face-lift.   The decor went from stuffy old world charm to modern and sleek. They also were piping in great music which is crucial to creating the hip atmosphere they are obviously striving for. We were sat at a table where we were able to enjoy the amazing view of the Phoenix city lights.   The menu provided decent selections which ranged from some interesting dishes to your classic steakhouse fare. One item I had to try was the cheese and truffle fritters, which were not a regular menu item, but on their Valentine's Day menu. They were fabulous and I could have eaten a bucket of them, but I refrained of course in order to be able experience the mushroom risotto and filet mignon. Both were excellent. I highly recommend the risotto because it was very flavorful and filled with creamy parmesan cheese (I am a pretty big fan of cheese if you have not noticed).   Overall, we were both very pleased with our experience. The service was a bit lacking which was disappointing because they were not completely packed and should have been a little more attentive. If you have not gone, I would certainly recommend giving it a try for a special occasion or if you are feel like dressing up and enjoying the gorgeous view!",

I chose J&G for our dessert course for the sweets, and the AMAZING view from the patio.  We were greeted promptly by name and seated immediately.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  At that time I explained that we were having appetizers 1st somewhere else and moving on to another restaurant for our main course, the ending our night of celebration here. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place.  Earlier in the day I had a conversation with the hostess and the manager on duty to ask the chef to prepare something special to top of our night.  I did let them know that my companion doesn't do chocolate...! Our service was attended to by the manager Ryan and our server Mercedes.  Needless to say, it was amazing!  They presented us with a table-side Cherries Jubilee.  YUMMM!  Then to top it off, the chef prepared a special birthday treat consisting of cheesecake, sauteed apples, and candied rhubarb. I had also let them know I had a gift in the trunk of my car that I wanted the valet to put on the front passenger seat to surprise my guest upon our departure.  All went off without a 2nd thought, and it was the end of a terrific experience for us both...!!!",

    "text": "J & G Steakhouse is a great place to come for a romantic and yummy meal, even for a vegetarian. From start to finish, the service is great and the atmosphere is fancy and nice. The view from the restaurant is gorgeous if you come for an early dinner while it's still light enough to see out. My boyfriend & I came here for a special date night and had a great time and I would recommend it for other couples. We had:  - Endive Salad: This was the least spectacular dish of the night but it was still fine. I found the dish to be too heavy on raw hard vegetables - thick endive, thick raw peas, and raw fennel.  - Tomato Soup: Nice & comforting. It tasted like really yummy tomato vodka pasta sauce in soup consistency. The cheddar toast it was served with was delicious. - Corn Ravioli with Basil Fondue: Amazing! I got this appetizer dish entree-sized as my vegetarian entree, and it's one of the yummiest dishes if you love pesto. The basil fondue is like a very fresh, very flavorful pesto sauce without the excess oil and much smoother and thinner. It was so amazing and went very well with the fresh corn raviolis. The ravioli had a great thin tender texture. - Prime Rib Eye: My boyfriend had this and said the meat was great. The J&G signature steak sauce on the other hand was pretty weird. It had a very strong orange & anise flavor, and wasn't to either of our likings.  - Salted Caramel Sundae: Yummy, pretty hard to mess up great ice cream and a lot of hot fudge. I didn't love the texture of popcorn with smooth ice cream so I ate that part separately. - Apple Tart: My boyfriend ordered this one and didn't like it but I did, so I got two desserts. I really liked the soft thick candied texture of the apple and the buttery pastry crust. The cinnamon ice cream was okay, but I ended up thinking the tart was yummier without it.",

Did not have time tonight to dine, but definitely will return based solely on two items:  1.) Jean-Gorges concept in Phoenix.  2.) The interior design coupled with the view!  There are also dining options on the terrace with 2 gas fire pits.    It was a mob scene tonight, but I am definitely looking forward to meeting friends for cocktails and savoring the moments here.",

    "text": "Finally made it to J&G Steak House located in the Phoenician resort in the former Mary Elaine's restaurant. J&G is brought to us by Michelin starred chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten of NYC. Upon arriving we entered the bar and liked what we saw. The bar is a fantastic environment with views overlooking the valley and a high-end modern design. Looking to impress the significant other I would definitely hit the bar. The crowd in this part of the restaurant seemed to be with it, as they were all dressed to the nines; especially the ladies.  But I wasn't there to gawk, I was there to pound some steak. We were quickly seated and a bus person  had some bread on the plates in seconds. That's where it stopped working like perfection. We were hanging out for 20 minutes before the waiter even approached the table. True to form with the rep Jean-Georges NYC restaurant of lousy service I might add. The service really didn't get much better from that point on. After placing the drink order we were waiting another 10-15 min before the first cocktail even arrived. I don't want to be rushed, but for god sakes get me a drink.  We finally ordered about an hour after being seated. My wife and I shared a Raw bar appetizer for two and a Caesar salad. The appetizer was very good and full of fresh fish and they did not skimp on the lobster. We were very pleased at this and looked at the price of $32/person as not being too bad for this type of place with the amount of lobster you get plus oysters etc. Next came the Caesar salad which was okay. They use the heart of romaine so it's a little pale in comparison to most Caesar preparations but not bad, just not something you're going to say \"wow, what a great Caesar salad\".  My wife ordered the pepper steak and I grabbed the 12oz Filet. We ordered a few sides as we always like to sample, and take home what we don't eat. We decided to try the mac and cheese, the steak fries, and the creamed spinach.  The meal arrived and we dug in. I have to say the filet was cooked to perfection. I would have like a little more crust on the steak but as far as steaks go it was nicely done,  and lived up to the rep of the owner. My wife also liked her pepper steak. They serve some very interesting sauces with the steaks so make sure to try all.  Unfortunately the sides were a big letdown. The mac & cheese was just a cut above Kraft. Nothing special, just cheese and mac. The creamed spinach had a unique taste but nothing special here either. I always hold creamed spinach up to the impossible to reach standard of Strip Steak in NYC and this version failed miserably. The fries were not bad. We had asked for them well done and they were great. Next was dessert. I ordered the sorbet and my wife ordered the raspberry soup. We both thoroughly enjoyed the dessert.   In retrospect the restaurant really needs to step up its service if it's going to hold its own with the likes of Mastros. Mastros has nothing to worry about in regards to J&G. The steak was superbly done, but the service and mediocre sides bring this hyped-up restaurant down in my book. If they had a 2.5 star I would give it that, but I will be forced to give it two even though the steak was great..",

    "text": "Let's get this out of the way first, I'm not a big fan of \"fancy\" steakhouses.  I tend to think they are stuff, too old fashioned & boring.  That said, this place proved to be an incredible night out & meal.  Apparently I was overdue for a \"hot date\" with my lady friend, and after reading some other Yelpers & checking out the website, I went for it.  We booked online reservations, and it was smooth sailing from the start.  We had a table right on the window, that just has incredible views.  The restaurant is dimly lit and has a modern, understated decor.  It is very comfortable and inviting, and it helps showcase the fantastic views of PXH.   ** As a side note for you other \"date night couples\", the line, \"The view here is beautiful, but not as much as you\" went off without a hitch.  Cheesy.  yes...  Cliche... YUP... Fantastically awesome... Check Yes!  Anyway, I think part of the reason I don't typically like places like this is the servers look at me with a condescending tone, as I don't probably look like I \"belong\" there, but our server was exactly the opposite.  He was nice, friendly & took the time to really ask what we like to make suggestions.  He picked one of the best appetizers I have ever had, the sweet corn tamales.  I could go, get a drink & just eat those...  He was also part of a team of people that are very quick and friendly at serving.  They also don't interrupt you to do thing s like fill water or clean plates.  To the food!  My lady friend had your standard Filet & I had the spiny lobster special.  The lobster was mighty fine, as it was served with a taste-tastic Tabasco butter.  I love the little things like that.  We also split some sides - Mac & Cheese and the Roasted Mushrooms.  The mushrooms were incredible.  I've never had anything like that before.  Beyond the food, I always take it upon myself to really explore the specialty bar menu, to see how good their \"bartenders\" really are.  Two slightly buzzed thumbs up!  I had a sour cherry caipirinha that was a seriously well crafted beverage, and again our server made excellent wine & cognac selections for after dinner.  As close as some of the other tables are to your own, we really weren't bothered by them.  The drunk pack of cougars next to us were entertaining if nothing else, and the foreign tourists on the other side were having a completely crazy conversation.    All in all, it was a great night, and \"Hot Date\" night was a hit with my lady friend.    I don't wear non flip-flop shoes often, but I'd definitely dust off my close toed shoes and go here again.  It has just the right mix of a little fancy, casual sophistication, modern and old traditional charm.",

We decided to give J&G's another shot. We are both happy we did! When we came in our table was not ready so they sat us at the bar. We got 2 drinks and snacked on yummy popcorn and nuts - SO good! I wanted to bring it to the table lol - don't worry I totally didn't! We ordered a bottle of white wine and my bf ordered the Crispy Calamari ($12) to start. I was shocked when he said it was really tasty! He is so picky with his calamari, so already off to a good start! I ordered the Arugula and Boston Lettuce Mustard Vinaigrette salad ($10 i know I am such a cheap date) and he ordered the Pacific Halibut Summer Vegetable Vin Cilantro ($30). We also got a side of Roasted Mushrooms Herbs and Chilies ($9) and Steamed Broccoli ($9). Overall the meal was very good! All the flavors were amazing and so was the service. We will definitely return! :)",

We got a table where both of us were seated looking out the window. Although it may make for an early dinner I would suggest coming here before sunset. The daytime views were more beautiful than the view at night.   Service after we ordered was a bit slow. It took quite some time for them to bring out bread for us even after drinks had been ordered. And our waiter was also pretty snobby.   The butternut squash soup with mushrooms was amazing. I wanted to lick the bowl clean. I can't explain how much I loved it. I would come back here just to have this soup and enjoy the view. Mike had the arugula and Boston lettuce salad with the mustard vinaigrette and it was just too peppery. I only had a bite of this and it was all I could take. It had some radishes thrown in with the greens. It was boring. Not a fan. He ordered the sirloin cap steak with frites for dinner and it came with a house made steak sauce. The steak was cooked perfectly medium and although Mike loves his steak sauce unfortunately he wasn't a fan of J&G's. I had the slow cooked salmon. It was served over a potato puree, with julienned veggies on top and a basil vinaigrette on the side. This dish was also very good. I had never thought of combining basil and salmon together, but the pairing was delicious. And the potato puree was so smooth and creamy. Lastly we both got the warm chocolate cake and caramel ice cream for dessert and it did not disappoint. The portions here were pretty generous. I was stuffed after dinner.   The restaurant has a dark sleek vibe (lots of leather tiles on the walls). The bar area was also beautiful. Tables are pretty close, but it didn't seem like the restaurant was too loud or that I could hear everyone's conversations around me. We'll definitely come back to try some other items on the menu.",

I was there for the food that a lot of people have been raving about.  I read somewhere that the hanger steak was their specialty and I don't disagree.  I had a taste and it was indeed very tasty.  And if I go back I will definitely get it.  And at under $20 it is a steal.  However, I ordered the 8oz filet for myself.  It was cooked properly and tasted good but not memorable.  The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.  And yes, the fries were just as everyone on Yelp said they were; good but just like In-n-Out's, but cooked a bit longer.  The sides dishes were ok at best and were a bit on the smaller side.  However, the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak place thus far.  While it is less expensive than Mastros/City Hall, I think that for a few extra dollars it is worth going to a better place.  In my opinion, Mastros/City Hall have much better steaks and better/bigger side dishes.  However, J & G does have a better ambiance.",

That being said, my salmon was great; however everyone who ordered steaks found them dry; the small serving of sauces were not enough for anyone to share.

For our mains, we had the prime ribeye Oscar style (which I would highly recommend) and it was the nicest cut of meat I think I've ever had, and the crab and asparagus just took it to the next level. We had a nice bottle of Merlot with our meal. And shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert, which was also amazing.  There service was attentive without being intrusive. It was really fantastic, the entire dining experience.",

    "text": "400th Review!!!!!!!!  I have been dying to try J & G Steakhouse for a very long time, and when I saw there was a group of Yelpers going to try them out during the fall restaurant week I knew this was my chance!    1st off, let's talk about the amazing view, you can see for miles, I honestly didn't want to leave, just wanted to watch the city lights twinkle and soak up the view!  For restaurant week, J&G offered a few choices, for me, I went to a steakhouse, so gosh darnit I'm having me some steak!! haha  I started with an arugula & boston lettuce salad with a mustard vinaigrette, now if you don't care of the bitter taste of the arugula, then this salad is not for you, but for me, everything blended perfectly.   I ordered the prime top sirloin cap which also came with a broccoli puree and some roasted garlic & chili flakes on the side, now the broccoli puree on its own tasted very wheat grassy green, if that makes since but the waiter told us to spinkle the garlic chili flakes over the steak and mix the steak with the puree, and OMG AMAZING!!!! The flavors all complement each other! Next thing I knew my steak was gone!! So good!!!   Ended my meal with caramel ice cream and a warm chocolate molten cake, omg so good!!! Love the combination of caramel and chocolate, had I not been at the J&G I'm pretty sure I would have licked my plate clean (not really, but yes it's that good).  Enjoyed my evening at J&G and with the company I was with, amazing views, great service, and excellent food! Hope to be back soon!",

The interior of the restaurant is dark and sleek - a very cool and sexy take on your traditional stuffy steakhouse.  As the planners of the event, we decided to ditch the group and dine solo in the lounge. This is the area is part of the bar and has low lying seating but is full service.  I had the short rib and brussels sprouts that evening and they were quite good, we also had the truffle cheese appetizers and I probably could have eaten the whole bowl.  For dessert we had the warm chocolate cake, the apple crumble and the passion fruit pavlova....the apple crumble won. Aside from the patio, food, and looks of this place, the service was very polished and professional and very nice. If I was in the area again, I would return.",

The caramel ice cream was delicious. The molten lava cake was good too and accompanied by a caramel tuile.   We also ordered the glazed miso mahi mani.

    "text": "Staying at the Phoenician and looking for an offsite dinner, we had a tire blow out and opted for a night in.  Great choice!  While not perfect, (in spite of my 5 star review), the food was outstanding.  I was leaning toward fish, but the waiter described the steak and I was in. One of THE best I've ever had.  I like a steak medium well and often I have chefs try to give me a lesser grade option thinking I do t know what I'm talking about.  But this was PERFECT!  Perfectly seasoned (not too salty), perfectly cooked.  And I LOVED the sauces.  LOVED!  I can't say I had a favorite.  So good.   Other winners were snap peas (with mi t and ginger) which were other-worldly and beets.  My wife opted for Tina taretar as an entree and loved that.   Toffee pudding was ridiculous!    The only \"miss\" was the four gras appetizer which was delicious but inexplicably served with a tart rhubarb puree.  The rhubarb sounded good but so over-powered and disappointed that we opted to forego it altogether Bd just do the pate with toast.  Really good. But in my humble opinion, a sweeter option would have made this as good as the rest of the meal.    Drinks were great a an excellent wine menu.  The place is a must!    Shoutout to bartender Brian, who made excellent drinks and listened to us.  And to Chris, who backed up our waiter and was just excellent!",

Read some of the Yelp reviews before making a reservation and cannot understand why the reviews were so good. The ambiance was less than expected even with the nice views outside the windows. First the table had paper place mats just like Denny's and no table cloths. The chairs were extremely heavy and difficult to move and adjust to the table after sitting down. Unlike other restaurants when a patron wears dark clothes a dark or black napkin is provided to avoid lint on the clothing, the napkins were white and barely cover the lap. Even though the restaurant had been redecorated there was too many hard surfaces for sound to bounce off of. I could barely hear the people at my table while hearing well the people at the next table that were shouting to be heard. Some music started playing during dinner that sounded like a bar band. Not sure when it stopped because the noise made it difficult to hear any of it. Service was average and the bus staff was over eager to remove plates and glasses quickly. Not a good experience. I will not be visiting again.",

Also the French onion soup was VERY salty, and the halibut was bland.  Atmosphere - 3 stars.

    "text": "Made a reservation through Open Table and requested a nice view for our anniversary. We were immediately seated and brought to a table with a large panoramic window. Perfect!   The $40 summer sunset menu is pre-fixed and includes a three course meal. We chose asparagus as an appetizer, the slow cooked salmon as an entree and the warm chocolate cake with caramel ice cream for dessert. The asparagus was alright -- came in four our five stems, but nothing to rave about like the salmon and chocolate cake. The salmon was cooked perfectly...not one bit of dryness. Real tender and a pretty good size. The chocolate cake was amazing. Coupled with the caramel ice cream, it is a perfect dessert. I don't have much of a sweet tooth. This dessert is not overly sweet and it just melts in your mouth. Thanks J&G for the \"Happy Anniversary\" greeting drizzled on our dessert plate...  We also got the 19 ounce rib eye ($ 60) to share. Again, cooked perfectly medium as requested. Real juicy and flavorful already. J&G offers sauces for your steak. As first timers, we did not know which to select. Our server kindly brought us a sample of the three most popular choices. In our opinion (from the three we tried), the best was the black pepper. Second was the chili glaze and third was the J&G steak sauce. Nice touch with the sauce condiment option...  Our server was very attentive and the manager came around to follow up with us as well. Along with the beers that we ordered (good selection of craft beer bottles at J&G), our dinner came out to $150 (total including tax and tip). Very great deal for a very full, satisfying meal for two with an amazing view and top notch service. Next time we are in Scottsdale, we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I just returned from another dinner at J and G steakhouse. This is probably at a minimum the eighth time I have been there. We used to eat at Mary Elaine's  and continued dining in the same spot at the Phoenician resort. This without question, cannot be considered fine dining! The last two dining experiences have been ruined by incredibly ill behaved tables near us. Shouting screaming and clapping and yelling. As it is that makes the atmosphere go straight downhill. The service is always slow and splotchy at best but the food is good. After an hour and a half of deafening noise from the savages we finally had about 15 minutes of peace and quiet and then asked for the check. We just wanted to leave a soon as possible because it was not an enjoyable experience. The waiter came by and we said bring us the check and gave him our credit card. He then took the credit card returned with a slip of paper which we signed and I went to the front desk to retrieve our leftovers while my wife was in the bathroom. The waiter frantically ran up to me and told me that I didn't sign any credit card slip. He was basically accusing me of trying to walk out. We then asked them to check and see what we signed. We couldn't imagine what we signed because we gave them the card, they left with it and returned to our table. It turned out that they gave us a room slip to sign and did not run our credit card. That is not our fault. I asked for the manager and a snooty young girl claimed she was the manager. She then chose talk over me every second that she could without listening to the crux of what I was saying. It is the servers issue if he did not run our credit card properly when we gave it to him. Then to have him run up to us as we were leaving like we are crooks is not acceptable. I tried to explain this and was talked down to and talked over every second I opened my mouth. When you combine the miserable atmosphere with being spoken to in such a rude and disrespectful manner by an untrained person it is easy to conclude that you will be taking yourself elsewhere for dinners. As we usually do our bill came to over $300. You have to ask yourself where can I go and relax and enjoy find food and not be treated like a second-class citizen writing a public bus. I attempted to explain to this supposed manager what the issue was and then I'd have decided it was time to leave when my wife said this is useless let's go. This ill behaved intern then turned and started spouting off to the my back as I walked away. At which point I gave her a few expletives and decided to leave for good.  In short you cannot find a worse place to spend such a large amount of money and then be treated rudely. I invite the management to search my reservation and phone number and then see exactly how many times I've been a repeat customer. There is no excuse for having such incompetence in running a restaurant and allowing the atmosphere to deteriorate to that of a second rate bar. No one in the hospitality industry should ever ever talk back to a guest to the back of their head as they walk away. If you're going to be rude and disrespectful at least have the Courage to do it right to the customers face.",

Why I adore J&G is that it's not your traditional steakhouse. You have elements of French and Asian which automatically wins me over. The bar area is great for meets and greets before dining to ease any nerves while you nibble over the tuna tartare or cheese fritters. Uh-mazing.  I am a carnivore and the deal breaker for me is always the Rib Eye. They cook it to perfection always and any of the sides will melt in your mouth. The asparagus paired with the risotto is so yummy. I prefer the Black Pepper Condiment with a side of brussel sprouts. But when you have good meat, it's hard to be disappointed.   Service is incredible. Attentive, friendly but always at a distance so you can negotiate the heck out of a deal. My biggest pet peeve is having a client dinner where we can't talk business without shouting and have a level of privacy. As for dates, it is very romantic getting to know someone over wonderful wine choices. You definitely have a wow factor dining on the patio catching the sunset. Here's my quip about other Yelp reviews regarding pricing. If you want cheap steak and mediocre setting, go to your chain restaurants. Out of fairness, you can't compare apples to oranges.",

    "text": "Located in the beautiful Phoenician Resort is the J & G Steakhouse. The inside is very clean shiny dark wood walls done in a contemporary way. Plenty of large windows to view the city and also a patio with fire pits.  The restaurant features more items than just steaks and the menu is accented with French and Asian Accents. Signature Items are recommended.  The Tuna Tartare (a signature item) might have been the best Tuna Tartare I ever had. Unless Tuna is really good I don't enjoy it raw but this was truly delicious. The fish was sweet and fresh and the textures of the Avocado were just right. The Ginger Marinade made it pop with the just right flavors.   The Black Truffle Cheese Fritters are very additive. They were only marble sized put packed a delicious mouthful. I could have eaten them all by myself. They had this very thin shell that tasted kind of like a yummy potato chip and the inside tasted like it was filled with like an Italian seasoned parmesan cream taste with truffles to me. It was a bomb of delicious flavors.   I had the Fresh just flown in that day sauteed Grouper with Spaghetti Squash. The Fish had a tasty nice seasoned crust and was flaky and moist inside. it sat in a sesame miso broth dotted with chili oil that didn't over power the fish. The spaghetti squash just soaked up the sauce.  My husband had the 19oz. Rib Eye with a side order of the Brussels Sprouts and the Black Pepper condiment. The steak was prepared MR as he requested. I tasted a small piece and it seemed on par with other steak houses but the Black Pepper Condiment was really Outstanding. I could tell a lot of work went into it. The sauce tasted like  combination of reduced beef confit onions with black pepper to me. It takes all day to make that kind of sauce.  I love brussels sprouts and pecans and aged balsamic but they didn't have that yum factor to me or to my husband. They weren't bad just OK.  We decided to try the Apple Crumble for dessert. It was as tasty as an apple crumble can be with a refreshing big hit of cinnamon and the creamy cinnamon ice cream went just right with it. It delicious but more homestyle than I was expecting.  If you have a Scottsdale/Phoenix Preferred Dining Card you can use it here.  Great Ambiance  Signature items have the WOW Factor",

At the table there was a little happy birthday card waiting for me! I thought that was a very nice touch.   I ordered the asparagus risotto as an appetizer. It was green in color which I've never seen before but it was absolutely delicious! My dad ordered the baby beet salad as an appetizer and said it was great. For my entree, I got the 12oz Filet Mignon. And let me tell you, this was probably the BEST piece of steak I've ever had in my life. It was perfectly cooked Medium and extremely tender. It almost just melted in my mouth. The taste was phenomenal. My dad ordered the Halibut and said it was very good. My boyfriend ordered the rib eye and didn't leave anything left on his plate! For sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes, broccoli, and snap peas. They were all super tasty!   After we finished our meals, I was treated to a complimentary chocolate lava cake. It was amazing! Best chocolate lava cake I've ever had.   OVERALL: The service here was prompt, attentive and organized. Overall, I would 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you're looking for a nice meal to celebrate an occasion or just to go out for a good dinner, this is definitely the place to go!",

We had prime seating by the windows overlooking the Phoenician pool and Scottsdale skyline.   As far as food selection, we ordered filet med rare and the Brussels. Steak was delicious with the bernaise sauce (cooked grilled.)  Brussels were bland, probably wouldn't order again. For dessert we had apple crisp and cheesecake. Both straightforward desserts. Cheesecake was very light and refreshing. Crisp was rich, tart and decadently sweet.   Overall 5 for ambiance, solid food and service.",

Took us 10 minutes to flag down our server who promptly replaced the steak with another that was also over cooked.   Meanwhile my salmon got cold as I waited for her entree to arrive. Didn't bother to get dessert as we were just disappointed with the experience. Ambience was cool - live guitarist that played very well although we did hear a rendition of Stairway to Heaven. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend J&G unless you want low grade food at a mid grade price. There are many other restaurants in the area that I'd recommend over J&G. Try Mastro's. Not sure why I deviated...",

My appetizer was fantastic, I had a pork belly dish which was one of the most delicious things I've ever had. My wife had french onion soup which was good, but nothing special or worth 12 dollars. The steak was adequate... for a JG restaurant I expected more than adequate... Perhaps my expectations were based on Jean Georges in NYC but for the price, it was no better than any other steakhouse that I've been to. The mashed potatoes were more butter than they were potato and tasted as such.  Disappointing was the desert, we had the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The ice cream did not taste like caramel and was a small portion. where as the cake was too strong of a chocolate flavor, it was overbearing and just too rich. Again, the food just fell short in comparison to the NYC restaurant.  Service was slow, but not terrible. Would expect more for the price.",

I booked through yelp and added a note that it was for my parents anniversary dinner and could we possibly have a great table to enjoy the view from. I called to verify the reservation a day ahead and they indeed knew it was an anniversary dinner but when we arrived the table they gave us was... Well, standard? The whole place has a nice view but I was anticipating something closer to the windows.  Once we ordered our food they brought out some bread rolls and butter. 2/5. Nothing to write home about. Meh.  We ordered the tuna tartare as a starter. 4/5 - delicious! Seriously yummy.  I then ordered the sunset menu from which you choose a starter, an entree and a dessert.  Starter I chose was a romaine salad. 3/5. Tasty at first...but overdressed. We all agreed there was some sort of Dijon mustard and lemon zest flavor going on. I didn't finish it because it wasn't that good.  Salmon - 5/5 holy God in heaven, I will return for this alone. I ordered it well done and it came as requested. It was tender, moist, tasty. and with every bite you get a forkful of buttery, garlicky mashed potatoes. Amazing. I was expecting the snap peas it came with to be fresh but they were cooked. No big deal. This meal is a winner. The 3 of us agreed the entree was excellent.  Dessert was a warm chocolate cake (molten style) with some flavorless ice cream on the side,2/5. Cake was ok, ice cream was... No thanks. We also had cappuccinos which were standard. The capps were comped since it was a special dinner and no extra desserts were ordered outside of our sunset menus so that was a nice gesture.  Atmosphere 5/5 - dark, quiet, loungy, romantic. Great viee of the sunset, the resort and the city lights below. Service 5/5- everyone was friendly, prompt and checked in on us just enough. No complaints there. Classy folks, UNLIKE the snotty folks working at another fancy restaurant on a different mountain I've reviewed before... Anyway.  The ambiance is special and the view is beautiful, the entree was perfect, the service was great and I will be back for more. I just won't go with high expectations for the bread rolls or the desserts.",

The view from the steakhouse is in incredible, especially at sunset. The appetizers was a shell fish sampler which was very good and consisted of lobster, oysters, and muscles. Next game the salad which was also very good. I had the tuna steak for dinner which was cooked rare and was very tasty. The dirt was a chocolate lava-like cake with vanilla ice cream. The service was very attentive and kind but again I am still very anxious to try dining with a small table.",

The place is located on the top floor of the resort and has an incredible view of the city. The place is dark but that adds to the romantic feel of the place. They had a tasting menu available but we also wanted to take advantage of the 25% off our second entree deal and since they would not offer it for the tasting menu we opted for a la carte.   We started with the tuna tartare, which was excellent. We then shared the watermelon gazpacho with poached shrimp. They split the soup for us, which was a nice touch but the taste was average. It was refreshing though. For our entrees, my wife had the bone in filet and I had the bone in ribeye. We had the creamed corn and creamed spinach for our sides. The steaks were amazing with great flavor and was cooked perfectly. They were both huge portions and I not only finished my steak but about 1/4 of my wife's too. They also bring out several sauces you can try with your steaks too which was fun. They were definitely not necessary because they had great flavor as is, but it was fun trying the different sauces. We both agree that the J & G steaksauce was the best which had carmelized onions in it.   My wife and I compared how this steakhouse compares to the many others we have tried and think it ranks a close second, just barely behind Mastro's City Hall. This decision was made on the basis of the flavor, cost, and atmosphere. Having said this, we would gladly come back here again because it is an excellent steakhouse.",

This place sits on the 5th floor and has plenty of glass to view out of.  You can see Phoenix in the distance and with the low level lighting it really is a nice, intimate place.    Lets talk food.... We ordered several appetizers, since we made happy hour :)  We enjoyed a fresh J and G Slider.  Great beef, tomato, and lettuce slider.  Simple snack.  We also tried the mushroom egg rolls.  Great flavor from the mushrooms and a nice dipping sauce.  The Beef Skewer was a happy hour item, will order again. Excellent seasoning and dipping sauce.  We even saved the sauce for further use :)  Also enjoyed some happy hour drinks, Italian creme soda is a great drink and I enjoyed a glass of Colores Del Sol Malbec and Paso a Paso Verdejo.  Then we got a hold of the non happy hour menu for more treats. Time for the dinner menu.  The pork belly appetizer was one of my favorite dishes.  Excellent amount of crispy skin, fat, and sweet topping to balance the salt in the pork.  Great dish that I plan on ordering again.  Then the best part, a great tasting menu for only $60.  This included 4 dishes and a desert.  A 5 course meal for only $60, we had to try it.  We enjoyed the tuna tartar, great flavor.  The radish and ginger was an excellent component to the tuna.  The Parmesan cheese risotto was the best I ever had.  Super creamy, excellent flavor with the cheese. The mushrooms were great with the risotto as well.  The risotto was my diet nightmare.  Time to run 5 miles after eating that rich and creamy dish.  The grilled beef tenderloin was excellent and luckily Julie, our waitress suggested some sauces for the beef.  The mustard mi so sauce was great with the tenderloin. Very tender and delicious, one of the best I have had in Arizona.  The Chilean Sea Bass was a nice, light protein with a great mi so broth that added a nice flavor to the meat.  Very tender and cooked perfectly.    Another surprise was the chocolate cake with Carmel ice cream.  I assumed it was like any other chocolate cake and ice cream desert.  Well the Carmel ice cream was excellent and every bite with the warm chocolate cake made a great balance of flavors.  I plan on having this desert again.  I must thank J and G steakhouse for providing an excellent meal.  I have not been so satisfied.  Worth every dollar I spent and I hope to enjoy many more evenings here.",

I think my expectations were maybe too high- I assumed the quality and presentation would live up to the namesake.    The good: very romantic (its dark- which I love) and if you are sitting outside they have a fire going.   Everything else is meh..  We had the seafood bar, which was very good considering we were in AZ.   The shrimp salad, one of the chef's specialities could have been amazing, but was over dressed to the point that the lettuce was limp.  eww.   I had a prime rib that was cooked perfectly, but I can't say it was any more special than any other steak I have ever had.   they presentation and they carving of the meat table side was nice.    My friend had the cod or sole.. I forget which.  Again, a nice table side deboning.   He said it was pretty good.  My other friend had the salmon- nothing special according to her.   The best part of the meal was the sides that we ordered: asparagus, mac & cheese were wonderful (the fries were fries and the snap peas were fine).  For desert we shared a carrot cake.  Again, really yummy but not outstanding.   Really, the best part of this place is the wonderful view from the patio.    They do have a wonderful wine list and a great bartender.  If you are staying at the Phoenician I would be inclined to have a drink at the bar and order some apps rather than eat at the restaurant.",

Three of us were seated at a booth/table kind of setting. Very typical all american steakhouse with dark interior, but the glass  columns in the middle made it more upscale and fancy looking.   We started off our dinner with the Chilled Shellfish Platter, which consisted a few different kinds raw seafood, they are lobster, jumbo shrimps, oysters, clams and mussels. Out of these five, the lobster and oysters were the best in my opinion. Very special side note, this platter is served with this cutest and smallest tabasco sauce bottle i have ever seen! You have to see to believe it, the size of the bottle is as small as a dessert spoon.   I chose the grilled Swordfish for my entree, two pieces of grilled swordfish filets on top of miso broth, though it was a bit too salty for me. One friend took the salmon and the other took the short rib. And omg, the short rib dish looks like a dessert, very pretty presentation, i almost thought it was a piece of chocolate cake with some green apple topping. Both had very good ratings to their dish.  And yes, free chocolate lava cake with ice cream for the birthday girl! Compare to Flemings, this lava cake was sweeter, which is to my side, and it was shape like a flower, very pretty! On top of the free cake, our service tonight was excellent!  A little side note, for the first-timer, I opted for self-parking as I always do, I had to take two different elevator to reach to the restaurant floor, so you know, it was a little confusing.",

Started with the \"jumbo\" shrimp app which was far from jumbo. Also had the oysters which were decent and onion soup which was pretty good. Then we had the ny strip which came out at room temperature and was just not good. Ordered it medium and wasn't pink at all. We had a 945 reservation which was their last so clearly wanted to close. Dee like they cooked steak when we ordered apps and just let it sit in the window. My girlfriend had the lobster which was very good. We also had the Brussels sprouts which I couldn't bare to eat. Our waiter couldn't have been nicer he was great! Overall just a very below average meal and not worth the money.",

Prob the best views in phoenix! Be prepared to spend a lot of guap- $$$$$$  Restaurant is located on the  5th floor I believe so take the elevator there. I recommend making reservations ahead of time (just in case).  We got the raw bar for app- it's basically a platter of oysters, mussels, lobster tail. Super fresh! Was it worth $42- prob not. You can def get the same high quality for cheaper somewhere else but people prob come here for the ambiance. We were seated inside so it was kind of hard to see the views but you can go to the balcony (empty areas) and take some pics.  For my entree I got the steak hanger with fries- cooked perfectly for medium rare ($27)- one of the cheaper options on the menu otherwise it can get really pricey. Honestly it was cooked perfectly but that is expected for a nice place like this. Could I get this somewhere else - same quality but cheaper? Yes, def. Like I said you come here for the ambiance and views.  if you're feeling fancy or if you're not paying- def come here!",

He knew he menu and courses everything appropriately. He wasn't overly friendly like a lot of higher end steakhouses.  The bread was fresh and hot, served with butter and coated in sea salt.   The tuna tartare was served over avocado, with radishes and a soy glaze. The tuna itself was fresh and diced perfectly. The avocado mousse was great as well. It wasn't overly salty like most soy based sauces.  The 12 ounce filet was excellent. It was slightly a little past medium rare, but I'm a steak snob so most people wouldn't notice this. The foie gras accompaniment was amazing. They give you a huge portion for the price.   The mashed potatoes, Brussels, and fries were great sides. The side portions are meant to be a la carte, but are not as massive as places like Mortons  or Ruth Chris.  Overall a great meal with unbelievable views.",

The salad was wilted lettuce with the stems still attached and was a choking hazard.  I ordered chicken parmesan without the cheese which was a big mistake - I received two pieces of grilled, hard and dry chicken with mashed potatoes.  The dessert strawberry dish - came with exactly one cut up strawberry ( yes! 1 strawberry) with hard merengue decorating the plate.  The egg white scramble that was ordered for breakfast had raw greens on top of it - we had to discard the greens  Their fruit pancakes however were delicious.  For the food in this prestigious hotel to be rated higher, the menu had to be more varied, and delicious.  The staff were wonderfully trained and were very efficient and polite.  The executive chefs might need a wake-up call.",

I agree that the food is a bit on the pricey side however someone has to pay for all the upkeep and ambience in that place right?  The view was great too and we sat facing the window that outlooked the fire pit.

She knew everything about everything on the menu and had the wine list down too! Everything we ate was delicious and we would definitely do it all over again.   WHEN you go, ask to sit outside and ask for Candace. It will be a wonderful dinner!",

We enjoyed the oysters, tuna tartar, salad, filet mignon, broccoli and French fries.  Other than the steak being more medium than medium rare, everything was delicious.   We ordered the apple cobbler for dessert and they brought us a chocolate lava cake too as a surprise for our anniversary. The cake was good, but really--do we need two desserts?  They should have just comped the cobbler.   All in all really good--overpriced but good.",

    "text": "I grew up in Phoenix but have lived in DC the last three years, so I'm rediscovering the Valley anew. I've been to a lot of fresh places since I've been back, but J&G is the freshest. I love this place - the vibe, the view, the cocktails and, of course, the food.   I visited J & G for a dinner and a happy hour for gratis events and was blown away both times. Yeah, yeah - I didn't pay - but after three years of dining and drinking in DC, take it from an expert - this place is a spectacular value (especially compared to other steakhouses).   First, dinner: since this was a gratis event, I wore stretchy pants and channeled my inner Augustus Gloop. My group ordered generously from the menu. To begin, I tried the french onion soup. Cheesy, savory goodness - good, but not the best I've ever had. It's eclipsed in my memory by my appetizer, the sweet corn ravioli. I've never tasted anything like it - and with each bite, I noticed a different element to the taste. And yet more elements when I took bites with the cherry tomatoes. It's seriously one of the best individual things I've eaten. In life. You can't come here and not order it.   For the main course, I had the filet with bearnaise and my group shared sides of macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and french fries. The steak was cooked to perfection - absolute buttah (without being actually soaked in butter :::cough, Ruth's Chris, cough:::). And speaking of butter, the bearnaise was absolutely drinkable. I was amazed I had enough self control not to do it. The fries and mashed potatoes were good, but the macaroni was another standout. Sadly, I've had a lot of whack macaroni and cheese at restaurants - J&G does it right. It's actually on their happy hour food menu, which I'll get to next.   We didn't have any room for dessert, but we did have cocktails on the veranda overlooking the absolutely fucking insane view of the city. They were expertly mixed and super unique - I tried a pisco sour, something I'd heard about but never been able to order before. The drink itself was expectedly kind of weird, but it was well-mixed. My gin and tonic after that was perfect.   On to happy hour: I didn't have to pay, but it is SO cheap. I will definitely be back. If you don't want to fork out for dinner - or want to do some thorough research before you do - come for happy hour to get a taste of the goodness. The same appetizers on the dinner menu are available for happy hour in smaller portions for $5. I tried the pork belly (good), sliders (good), fries (great - but when aren't they?!), the sweet corn ravioli and the mac and cheese (you already know how I feel). Then the beers (microbrews, no less!) were only $4 I think. I had wine, and it was $6 a glass. I'm sort of a philistine when it comes to wine, but it was decidedly better than the swill I normally get for a similar price at the store or at other happy hours. We ate and drank inside, watching the sunset through the windows, listening to their DJ/live music combo. Magical.  Bottom line: I love this place. I couldn't afford dinners here very often, but I'll be back for the happy hours and for dinner as an occasional \"treat.\" My waistline will be relieved!",

Since we're not total pigs, we split each of the plates. The chef was nice enough to split each of the orders without me asking them to do so. Plus there was no random share charge. Each of the courses was excellent.   Make sure to put this in the queue if you're in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner with a party of 5.  I had requested a table with a view and they delivered by seating us next to a window (they also have tables outside on the balcony but it's summertime in Phoenix so no thanks).  You can't see the sunset from this side of the building, but at night, the city lights are gorgeous.  The dining room has a little bit of a retro 60s flavor with the banquettes and layout,  but the furniture and decor are very current.  Bathrooms were also spotless (nobody ever mentions this in restaurant reviews but I always find this information useful).  Our waiter started off by explaining that the restaurant was named for Jean Georges Vongerichten, \"a famous chef in NYC.\"  Hmm. If you have to explain that someone is famous... well, enough said.  We were aware of the man behind the name \"JG\" before we made our reservation, but primarily because we know him as the husband of Marja from the Kimchi Chronicles.  Go PBS!    Service was overall fantastic.  Friendly, but not too casual.    Highlights from the meal included the tuna tartare (wow!), crab cake (chock full of crab and the peas were dynamite), black truffle cheese fritters (apparently truffle can make even fried cheese classy), veal, salmon, and the peppercorn steak.  Desserts were tasty but very standard steakhouse fare - carrot cake, ice cream sundae, warm chocolate cake.  No surprises here.  Honestly I would've probably chosen 4 1/2 stars but since yelp only allows you to assign \"whole\" stars I think it was more fair to round up rather than down.  It's a steakhouse, but I feel like the most interesting items on the menu were not traditional steakhouse fare.    I would totally come back.  Especially if someone else was buying.",

As Mary Elaines the space was elegant, regal, sophisticated, refined.  As J & G the space feels like a sleek flashy Vegas restaurant.  I am still recovering from that shock.  I was there to give it a try.  So here you go.  Tasting Menu  Tuna Tartar (Delicious) Parmesan Risotto (needed salt, but good) Sea Bass (Excellent, so moist) Beef (Good, but excellent tasting steak sauce was ice cold) Chocolate Cake (Wow!!!)  Cocktail/ Wine  Sidecar (awesome) Some sort of big red wine.  Our waiter was good and explained the menu very well.

Our dinner took a really, really long time. The oysters were excellent but the rest of our food was just ok. I ordered an heirloom tomato salad, which was good, but it had onion rings on top which made no sense at all. I love onion rings- just didn't go together. I've had better steak other places. Overall, it's worth going for the view but don't expect great food. There are definitely better placed to eat in Scottsdale.",

It gets four and not 3 stars for a couple of reasons. It's got a lovely atmosphere; it's very contemporary without feeling cold and unwelcome. They also have a raw bar that had some great oyster options. The clincher for me, though, was the foie gras terrine. It was simply superb. Served warm with crusty bread and rhubarb chutney, I could have eaten the whole thing myself but for the sake of my waistline, I'm glad we were sharing amongst friends. The foie gras was sweet and decadent.  Finally, the steaks were good but were no better than any other nice steak house but they had two sides that were very good and made it be a 4-star meal: their potato gratin is simply excellent and their mac and cheese was also very good. We ordered several sides and shared them amongst 6 people and everyone definitely got a good taste of everything. I think sharing a side between two or three would be perfect. Good wine list, good cocktails.  It's worth the trip.",

Wine - great. I bet the cocktails are, too, but I didn't have one. I did have the $38 per person seafood appetizer which is pretty much a meal on it's own - a lobster tail, some clams, oysters, mussels... good stuff, and with 4 sauces, not 3, not 5. 4. There will be a test later. Only downside, it tasted like the seafood had been prepared then refrigerated. For $38 per person for an appetizer, motherfuckers, youse betta make dat shit fresh homie. Don't give me no chicken of the sea buuuuuulllllllll shit! OK maybe that's a little over the top. It could have been better, but it wasn't horrid.   The side dishes were tasty. I had the steak frite, a hangar steak with fries, kinda frenchie style and shit, cuz I gots class yo. The quality of the beef was high, it was very tender, the chef understood what \"Medium Rare\" means, it was like quality and skill in preparation came together to make a perfect steak, om nom nom. The fries though kind of had a frozen safeway brand quality to them. How do you fuck up french fries? One of the other dinner attendees had the filet, which looked tender and juicy and perfectly cooked, and I have to say the salmon was beautiful and translucent and perfect looking, enough so that I was actually impressed. The sides were A OK. We didn't have any creamed sides - just the normal variety.   The food is good but the ambiance is better. I hate writing that. it's still 4 stars.  The best seating is by the window, no doubt. I saw some douchetard there with his lady, sitting by the window - facing AWAY from it. Yo homie! No ass for you, you're doing it wrong.",

First, I just want to say that this place makes a proper old fashioned. I took a sip, smiled and poured a little on the floor for Don Draper. But when it comes right down to it, you got to judge the place on the food that is part of the name, right? Steak!!   I ordered the filet. Usually, I will get a rib-eye or a porterhouse, but it is bikini season after all. Anyway, I order my usual medium rare, we get some asparagus(sp?) and prepare to chow down. Oh, we had oysters to start and they were great, but get some cocktail sauce unless you really love vinegar on your oysters. Back to the steak- her's was perfectly cooked and mine came about medium well. I have officially become a steak snob because I hate when my $45 piece of beef is molested by too much heat!! I sent it back, my date called me a meat princess and I thought I had a great new Yelp name. After lots of apologizing by the very attentive staff, I got my second one and it was perfecto. Second time's the charm I guess. I really liked this place and you will too.",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice now, and the first time was pretty decent, and the second time, was really fantastic, which is why I'm only giving it four stars.  The first meal, we had the tuna tartare and the french onion soup.  The tartare was fantastic.  In this day, let's be honest. Tuna Tartare is so ubiquitous that it's difficult to do anything innovative with it, and usually, it's a bit disappointing.  In this case, it was both innovative and wonderfully tasty.  It has really fresh tuna on top of avocado and topped with fine slices of crispy radish--all mixed with a lovely soy-lime syrup. Really, really tasty, and rivals my all-time favorite tuna tartare from Michael Mina.    The onion soup was really, really good--onions that have been caramelized a very long time, and broth with a lot of depth and richness.  Very tasty.    The first visit I had the hanger steak--sure, it's one of the cheapest cuts of meat on the menu, but it wasn't seasoned that well (needed salt), and the sauce i ordered it with (the bearnaise) was fairly underwhelming.    Now, the second visit, I had one of the best steaks in my lifetime (yes, seriously, and I don't tend to exaggerate).  I had the ribeye, which is a prime cut.  It was cooked to perfection (i ordered it medium rare), and for me, the best part was the outside was charred in the best sense of the word.  They must have put the steak on a cast iron pan on both sides as it had a beautifully crunchy and flavorful crust, yet the inside was still wonderfully pink.  Not cheap at $46, but fantastically good.    A few other notes:  the atmosphere is very New York City-like.  It's dark and black, and for us,this is a huge positive--it feels very sleek and modern, and has a beautiful view of the skyline.    additionally, the staff is incredibly warm and friendly.  we brought our 3 month newborn along with us, and they were extremely accommodating.  Troy, one of the managers, I suspect, went out of his way to make us feel welcome and comfortable--granted, we are resort guests and had been there 2 nights out of three, but even so, the staff is incredibly nice and service is excellent.    my sense is go here if you're planning on going big (i.e., getting a nice hearty steak).",

The waiter was friendly the view was nice and hence the 2 stars. Steaks were ordered medium-rare and came out almost an hour later medium-well. Cheese truffle fritters were good, but the miso glazed swordfish was cold. Save your time and go to city hall or especially Donovan's for a great steak house.",

    "text": "I've been a huge fan of Jean Georges for years beginning with Prime at Bellagio, followed by Market in Paris. In Las Vegas, we used to go at least once each trip we made there. With so many new restaurants popping up in Sin City, we've chosen to try others, but after our dinner at J & G Steakhouse at the Phoenician, I think next time we go back to LV, we'll have to make a reservation at Prime. The menus are very similar, in JG's typical French-Asian inspired steakhouse.   First of all, the restaurant space is just gorgeous . . . and its location atop the Phoenician is a perfect setting for twinkling city views. Patio dining in the premium months alone would make it worth the price of admission. I particularly love the semicircle booths that ring the main dining room. We opted for seats by the window, and really enjoyed the \"corner\" like booth we shared. It was our 22nd wedding anniversary, which I let them know by reservation through \"Open Table\", and we were greeted warmly by the hostess acknowledging our celebration, as did our waiter, the restaurant manager, and just about everyone who served us at our table. It was lovely.  Our server Brian was delightful . . . very unassuming, friendly and informative. He was very helpful in offering suggestions, highlighting favorites, and not overselling, which I find to be a real drag at many other finer dining establishments. The one thing I found incongruous in the entire setting was the \"butcher paper\" place mats. They just seemed so out of place for this elegant establishment.  To start, my hubby ordered a half-bottle of Mount Veeder Cabernet. Neither of us are big drinkers, and the fact that J & G had a pretty extensive list of half-bottles was a real treat! It was full bodied and delicious, and just a perfect amount to see us through our dinner.    My husband ordered a sampling of the days selection of oysters on the half-shell.  All were perfectly shucked, but the Blue Points were supremely meaty with a little salty finish. For starters my husband ordered the wildly popular Tuna Tartare. The tuna was so light and fresh and melded well with the bed of avocado and ginger marinade. I opted for the Butternut Squash soup, a favorite of mine at Prime as well. It was just how I remembered. The oyster mushrooms come in the bottom of the bowl, and the attendant then pours the soup over it . . . it is so creamy, a little sweet, a little savory. I would have licked the bowl had I not been in a public room. Yum!  Hubby splurged and chose the 16 ounce Six Peppercorn Prime NY Steak. He was on Cloud Nine. I totally forbid eating red meat at home, so when we dine out, I don't make a fuss if that's what he chooses. The steak came perfectly medium rare and it was accompanied by four sauces from which he could choose.  In order of preference, Bearnaise, Smoked Chili Glaze, J & G Steak Sauce and Black Pepper Condiment. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with Honshimeji Mushrooms in a Miso Yuzu Broth. It was to me an unusual preparation for Chilean Seabass, but was simply refreshing and clean with a bit of a citrus finish. Honestly, I could only finish half as I was so stuffed from the starters. In addition, we ordered two sides, the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts with Balsamic Vinegar and Pecans and the Potato Gratin with Comte. Both were great for sharing. The potato gratin was so rich, between the both of us, we could only eat half the order. Needless to say, we brought a little of everything home with us in a \"doggie bag\" and had it for lunch . . . and it was just as delicious warmed in the microwave now that the flavors had time to sit.  If you can believe, we saved room for dessert! For our anniversary we were treated to a free Raspberry and Rose Pavlova with crisp Meringue and raspberry sorbet. We also ordered the Warm Chocolate Cake with caramel ice cream. Hubby loved the Pavlova the best and pretty much consumed it all before I could even get a good taste. He was on a major sugar high. I had a couple of bites of the warm chocolate cake and was blown away by the texture of the cake with its warm bittersweet chocolate center. I was in chocolate heaven. The caramel ice cream was a perfect pairing. Some of the best ice cream I have tasted in eons.  As we left, we were both in our \"tummy full, nap now\" mode . . . very sated with the atmosphere, service and cuisine!",

    "text": "My husband took me here for our first wedding anniversary.  We liked it so much, we took our friends for their fifth wedding anniversary.  Let me say that the first thing that let me know I was in for a treat was the ambiance. The decor had a retro-modern feel, and the view - day or night- is spectacular. I don't believe there's a bad table in the house.  So we have our priorities straight right? The first thing we order are the drinks: a double Martel for him, a Sprite with green olives for me.  (Cut me a break; I was 4 months preggers at the time, and the olives make me appear as though I'm \"doin' something\", lol.)  After we get that out of the way, next come the appetizers: Tuna Tartar, Crispy Calamari, and last but FAR from least, the Peekytoe Crab Cakes. In a word: YUM. And that was just the beginning.  For my entree, I orded the House Salad, the 12oz Filet Mignon (I was preggers, what did you expect?), Potatos Gratin with Comte (don't know what the Comte is, but it really doesn't matter... the sh* was GOOD).  I have NO complaints about the service.  The staff was friendly, and attentive without being overbearing.  They definitely earned their 20%.    Would I go again? HECK yes.  Make sure you save your pennies; it's gonna cost you all of the pretty ones, because you know this kind of dining ain't cheap.",

We came here for dinner for my bday when my family was visiting, and they seated us by the window, which gave us a great view of the valley. Our server Justis was great, really polite, helpful, and very attentive.   My sister and I each had the tasting menu with 5 courses (tuna tartare, asparagus/lime risotto, chilean sea bass, petite filet mignon, and the chocolate lava cake with caramel ice cream to finish it off). Everything was amazing, they couldn't have picked better things to give us a taste of what they had to offer. Our steak also came with a side of fries and spinach Everything had amazing flavor, really rich, and nothing was too overwhelming. The proportions were also the right size to fill us up without seeming glutinous. My mom had the filet mignon with a side of asparagus that was cooked to perfection as well. Justis also brought us complimentary selection of the special sauces (we really liked the house sauce and the sweet chili sauce, I wasn't a fan of bernaise sauce) My lava cake even came out with a candle and happy birthday written in icing which was nice.   Overall, we were very happy with this place and found that the prices were worth it for special occasions such as this!",

    "text": "I went here last summer with my husband when they were offering a prix fixe menu. I got the steamed shrimp salad with champagne vinaigrette, flat iron steak and fries, and warm chocolate cake with caramel ice cream for dessert. My husband got the heart of romaine Caesar salad, a parmesan crusted chicken dish, and cheesecake with strawberry jam and rhubarb ice cream.  Everything was absolutely delicious, with generous portions. I've never had a salad as good as the one I had here. My steak was cooked perfectly, and my husband's chicken dish was really good too.   Dessert totally stole the show - my molten chocolate cake was paired with a crisp sheet of caramel and a complex caramel ice cream. None of that one dimensional Brach's style caramel...no, this was the kind you get by cooking cream and sugar and butter for a long while on the stove. Buttery, slightly burnt tasting, like the best kind of creme caramel topping in ice cream form. My husband tried it and literally said \"Wow!\"  His dessert was pretty amazing too. A dense, creamy cheesecake not grainy in the slightest, paired with a little sweet strawberry jam and wonderfully tart, creamy rhubarb ice cream. As intense and rich as my dessert was, my husband's was refreshing and light. Who knew cheesecake could be the lighter of the two options for the night?  Since we just had the menu and no alcohol or other appetizers, it was just the $35 per person plus tip. Service was friendly and attentive without being officious or overbearing, which is always a plus. The only downside to the evening was that we didn't realize you had to ask to be seated by the window so we could see the awesome views. Instead, we ended up in the middle of the restaurant.  I would definitely go back, especially for a new prix fixe menu but even if I had to pay full price. It was a great experience and the food was worth remembering, even a year later!",

    "text": "This place is so fancy-looking, you would think it would cost an arm and a leg.  We were wow-ed when we walked in for Thanksgiving Dinner.  I picked J&G after looking at over 30 restaurant menus.  I've never been a huge fan of turkey so I was looking for an upscale, festive dinner with lots of protein options.  Luckily, J&G served both a 3-course Thanksgiving turkey meal for $45 and everything (except the tasting menu) from the regular dinner menu.  The three of us shared what we ordered and I enjoyed the meal overall. -Steamed Shrimp Salad with Avocado and Mushroom Champagne Vinaigrette ($14): I'm not a big salad person but this was actually very good. 4* -Sweet and Sour Pork Belly Ginger-Shallot Confit ($10): Yea, don't trust those Americans when try try to go Asian. 2* -Red Wine Glazed Short Ribs ($24): This wasn't as good as it sounded. The short ribs could have been more tender. 3* -16oz Peppercorn Prime NY Steak ($47): Excellent value for the size of the steak.  I wasn't a huge fan of the sauces that were provided but the steak was cooked the way I wanted. 4* -Mac & Cheese ($9): Yummy! (But a little overpriced) 4.5* -Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes ($9): For the size of the container, this was also overpriced, but nonetheless, very tasty. 4.5* -Lemon Vanilla Creme Brulee with Lemon Sorbet ($10): You know, I was a bit disappointed by the flavor. The top didn't seem to be torched properly. 3* -Warm Chocolate Cake with Caramel Ice Cream $9): Classic, rich and delicious. 4* -Bottle of Casa Lapostolle Cuvee Alexandre 2007 ($42): Not bad for a bottle of wine at this price point. 4*  It was a feast.  The food was sophisticated, the service was good and the price was so reasonable.  Seriously $75 per person for so much food at a place with amazing ambiance and an awesome view is quite the bargain.",

We decided to make a reservations a month ago and have 5 adults for dinner on Thanksgiving. We had a 5:45 reservations as service started around 5 pm on Thanksgiving at J and G. Something was really off with the service! We did the pre-set Thanksgiving meal at 65 dollars per person. The dinner was ok but not great as turkey was dry. It was as if we were forgotten. No one even made a pass by our table once our main dish was served. No offer of coffee or after dinner drinks. No sign of our desert which was included. After 15 minutes with dishes sitting in front of us with no one coming by to collect we finally stood up walking to the patio outside and requested to someone walking to notify our server we were requesting our desert to be brought to patio. A gal, not our server, who looked like she may have been helping in kitchen delivered the deserts outside another 15 minutes later. No offer of coffee or after dinner drinks. We saw the manager, Patrick, walking around but found it odd he was not noticing the lack of service at several tables....mainly ours. Under staffed? Not sure but they clearly knew in advanced how many people had reservations. Disappointed. Expect more from a restaurant who aspires to be top notch.",

Views were great although you can't see the sunset because it faces south.  Ambience was nice...mostly couples and quiet with light background music.  I had the lobster which wasn't the freshest but it was prepared perfectly and the sauce was very tasty.  Hubs had the filet which was also cooked to perfection.  They brought us out a complimentary dessert, the pavlova. I had never had anything like it- raspberry sorbet covered in a meringue with whipped topping and raspberries.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  Also, the 1/2 price wine bottles on Sundays topped off the evening.  Def recommend for a romantic dinner out.  Will return to check out the patio with the firepit in the winter for apps and drinks.",

Pork belly appetizers, salmon, filet, tenderloin, NY strip and lamb chops each was as hoped and the four sauces brought for the beef were a nice addition. Parker house rolls with sea salt were yummy. A beautiful panoramic view of city lights and roaring fires on the patio.   The sides, soups, salads and desserts didn't live up to or enhance the enteees. Butternut squash soup was one note and the chopped salad was overly vinegar tasting. We tried six different sides and three desserts that were just additional bites. Warm bitter coffee on night one.   The service each night was like two different restaurants. Tuesday had us sitting for four hours. Thursday the service and pacing was impeccable.

From the unique cocktails in the lounge/bar area to our fantastic dinner and the night cap on the ground patio this was a True experience. Exactly what we were looking for. When your spending a few $$$ on dining, I like to soak it all in and take my time. Since this is on the grounds of the Phoenician there is plenty of beauty to admire.  Definitely arrive early for your reso's in order to spend 30 minutes in the lounge sipping on a specialty cocktail. We enjoyed all aspects of our dining experience and even though we were seated later than expected we never felt rushed. - Kumamoto oysters - fresh and, as always, the perfect balance of mild brine and sweetness - Shrimp cocktail - as expected - Wagyu Tomahawk steak was grilled just right to medium rare and served with seared mini peppers - a nice touch! We liked that they sliced the steak tableside too. As steak \"purists\" we weren't a fan of the J&G Steak Sauce or the Hot Buttery Sauce (too sweet for our tastes) - though the signature offering was appreciated.  - The Beets and Potato Gratin with Comte were tasty - The warm bday chocolate cake with caramel ice cream was the perfect end to dining - it's more like a souffle/molten cake with it's light texture. Can I have another?!  Note, take care when ordering a Dirty Martini from the ground floor/patio area bar. I had to ask for extra olive brine to achieve the proper salty ratio of Tito's to brine. For $18 they should know how to make it perfectly!!",

I know it is a steak house but sometimes people take someone that is a steak lover but don't eat steak.  Also the view is ok but not fabulous.  The service was good but not great. However the manager did come to say hi and check on is and also they provided a nice cake for my moms bday.  It wasn't busy and we were able to enjoy some wine out by the fire.  The sides were almost better than the main meal.  I recommend the cheesy potatoes and the huge asparagus.  My expectations are always very high for a nice restaurant.",

To start, I ordered the French Onion Soup and absolutely loved it! For my main course, I shocked myself by ordering chicken at a steakhouse! The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was delicious! It's covered in a perfectly tangy lemon sauce, and served with asparagus. We also ordered some shared sides for the table - creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and large asparagus. I especially enjoyed the creamed spinach. At the end of the meal, they brought out a little dessert for the birthday girl! The service was a little slow. It seems like restaurants of this caliber usually have multiple servers per table to ensure you are never waiting for a wine refill. But overall, everyone enjoyed their meals!!",

    "text": "We have been to the Pheonician a couple of times in the past but this was our first visit to the steakhouse. We were visiting from Hawaii and I wanted to treat the in-laws to somewhere special, and it was a hit! Incredible food with one of the valley's best views.  The food was of course wonderful. Truffle fritters were my favorite appetizer we tried, but the ahi tare tare was a close second. Living in Hawaii we get a lot of great raw seafood dishes, but this was the best ahi tare tare I've had. Filet Mignon Steak was cooked to perfection, but the highlight for me was the C02 injected bearnaise sauce. It was so light and flavorful, and not overly rich and heavy like a lot of places have.   The service was nothing short of amazing as to be expected at such a place. I go through a lot of water, and my glass was never less than half full. Sitting with an empty glass is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, so I was quite impressed by the hyper attentive staff.   A special thanks to our server Austin who was quite knowledgable about the food and beverages and answered all of our questions. Wonderful experience and successful dinner and it started and ended with our great waiter Austin and the professional staff at J&G steakhouse. 10 out of 10, will be back next time we're in town.",

Austin was our server for the night and he was great and very knowledgeable and helpful with his suggestions. I have a gluten dietary restriction and they were very accommodating to this. I highly recommend the tasting menu, it is an amazing deal at only $67 for a 5 course meal and to that you can add a wine tasting for every course meaning 5 wine glasses for another $40!!! The manager Henry stopped by to check on us and wished us a happy anniversary. They also sent us a dessert and a happy anniversary hand written card from the general manager which was a nice touch. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family and will be back again soon! Thank you!!!",

Environment:  5 stars  Contemporary elegant setting  Welcoming:    5 stars Service:         5 stars (Candace our server was great; checked on us frequently)  Manager came around and even filled our water glasses.  Everyone is hands-on.  Food:        French onion soup                 5 stars      Amazing parker house rolls    5 stars      Veal chop so thick and juicy and perfectly prepared:  5 stars      Steak with frites:   2 stars-------- an average piece of steak; I can't say the meat was delicious.      Frites were fine.       Spinach (sauteed):  2 stars------ No distinctive flavor despite being told that the spinach had herbs in it, including mint. (could not discern the mint)   We cut up the small roasted peppers which accompanied the veal chop and added it to the spinach along with peppercorn sauce and certainly improved the flavor.  (Did I just cook on my birthday?)   Sauces:  4 stars---they provided 3 sauces to choose from to enhance the flavors of the meats. Dessert:   4 stars----Chocolate molten cake with caramel ice cream.   Chocolate cake was not cloyingly sweet.  Nice!",

The waitress should have recommended that, but she didn't. She was slow getting our wine order after being slow greeting us. She failed to keep her head on a swivel and notice those she was serving. Once she delivered our dessert menus she never came back as we watched her walk past us 5X. Really just a service issue and for a resort trying to get a 5 diamond status we were really disappointed with the service.",

That's until the most recent visit. The waiter was rude. Not just rude to us the customers. He was rude to the runners. Got our orders wrong and didn't want to own up to his mistake. The food was mediocre, possibly due to the fact that it was near closing time. That being said, the warm shrimp salad is highly recommended, their steak is excellent and the salmon, Dover sole were all well prepared. Mix drinks are delicious and their brioche bread is likely 3000 calories but worth it. Though the last visit left a bad taste I'd still recommend it just hope you get a better waiter/waitress than I did. Horrible waiter took a star.",

I lived in Chicago for almost 20 years and hit pretty much all the big steakhouses in that time - Gibsons, Joe's, S&W, Chophouse, and the chains - Mortons/Capital Grill.  I know a good steakhouse and J&G doesn't come close to even the chains.  I had the Six Peppercorn NY Steak with foie gras.  The peppercorn was strong which was fine with me but the meat was very flavorless. Even the foie gras was bland. The slides were small and the fries were cold when served to our table.    The view is very nice and the wait staff did an excellent job but the kitchen and beef let them down big time.",

    "text": "My wife and I make it an absolute priority to stop in for drinks and small plates whenever we visit Phoenix so this was going to be our typical check on the list for the evening.  That is, until we were thrown for a loop.  We usually opt for the Thirsty Camel since it's great for people watching and the atmosphere is upbeat rather than typical hotel lounges which will put you to sleep fast.  Well, that went out the window due to them renovating the entire area including the main entrance.  So now what?  Our driver dropped us at the other entrance and we had to make a decision.  Do we leave and go to Mastro's or start at J & G?  We opted for the latter and it was a great decision. I have been to this city for the better part of 27 years and I have never been to this place mainly because I had a destination always planned out ahead of time.    The visuals are stunning to start off with.  It has an wide view of the entire valley, the lounge itself is well put together and the restaurant is gorgeous.  We always tend to opt for the bar when we are going out for a night on the town since we gravitate towards small plates and the more immediate service aspect rather than the full presentation.  Brian was taking care of us and he was on point.  Very conversational, attentive and we felt 100% taken care of.  A lot of bartenders will give you the small talk and it's somewhat canned and then presented in a way that makes you feel if you come back the next night, it's the same exact interaction verbatim.  He was not that way at all.    I opted for the Pinot Blanc and then a glass of Pinot Grigio while my wife had the Brut Rose'.  Both were excellent.  The appetizers were what really shined here though.  The shrimp cocktail was perfect.  The chill was exactly what you want and the size were quite large.  The Tuna Tartare' was just ok in our opinion.  It was missing something but it wasn't bad.  It could be that we just enjoyed the other items more.    The appetizer that blew my mind though was the Crispy Calamari.  I have to preface the fact that I am not a calamari person by nature but this was off the grid in terms of a great dish.  It's almost impossible to get calamari to be crispy, flaky and not have it be overly greasy or rubbery.  Well, they did just that.  It had a consistency that I have never experienced.  It was so good that we ordered it again.  That's about as common for me as having a Vegan try a Bone-In Ribeye and then order another.    The music which was provided was a nice addition without being overly loud to where we couldn't hear ourselves talk.  The sum it up, I think The Thirsty Camel lost two customers and J & G gained two.  This has nothing to do with the former but everything to do with the latter.  It's hard to go wrong either way.",

Couldn't figure out where the restaurant was, no one in the entry to ask questions.  Then, how do you operate the elevator?? This was really strange. Most high tech elevator I have been in, you don't push any buttons once inside, and when we left the restaurant, couldn't figure out how to get back to the lobby area!  We arrived within a few minutes of reservation which was 6:45 PM. It was not very busy. After we were seated, the beverage girl came by with water. That was it!  We waited for at least 30 minutes before we even saw our waiter, Really bad. He kept walking behind us, but never came and introduced himself.  It was ONE HOUR after we were seated before we were served.  We sat there with absolutely NOTHING to eat! no bread, no crackers, NOTHING! The food server brought us our food, served it (still no waiter) and left. No one came by to check on \"how is everything\".  Finally at 8:30 (remember we arrived at 6:50) we asked for our check and left.  If the service had not been so bad we would have had dessert. As it was, our bill for 2 people was $200!! Horrible experience.  Food was good, but $66 for filet of sole? really? not sure why it was so expensive.  The meat was less. Everything was a la carte. We had asparagus, mashed potatoes and bernaise sauce, all which was in addition to the entre.  By the time we left, it was busier. This was for a Wed evening. I don't know if the other tables got better service or not, but I would not come here again. Plenty of other choices. The service in this hotel overall is awful!",

    "text": "I took my date here. It looked like a very classy restaurant so we dressed very classy: she looked especially gorgeous in her white blouse against her red lipstick, and I decorated myself with a button-up, chino's, and a purple bow-tie around my neck that matched how breathless I felt being near her. This was to be an especially romantic night --a big night for an important decision, one that makes or breaks our time together. And J&G Steakhouse provided the perfect setting.  Walking into J&G I did feel a bit self-conscious about being overly-dressed as I saw people in t-shirts, but honestly, the steakhouse has such a comfortable blend of contemporary rustic-ness that whatever you wear will be hidden in the atmosphere of pure class and low-ambient lighting. Nonetheless, the hostess complimented my date on her outfit, and she blushed. Points awarded right through the door.  Walking in and you immediately notice the lighting: it's dimly lit, but  these tall glass walls offer light to the area around them, and it gives a classy atmosphere. There's a woman on the piano playing and singing on the other side of the long dining hall, and it sounds like romance itself.  And it's loud. But that's good --because you have to draw closer to your date in order to hear her.   The menu is pricey, but fancy. We opted for the 5-course meal and wine pairing ($60+$35 each). The waitress presented the wine to be served with the course, explained why they chose it and how it will affect the meal, poured our glasses, and then the waiters presented our food. They were constantly replacing mats, pouring more water, replacing forks --we never went without throughout the whole evening.   The food was delicious. I wasn't blown away by any course in particular. For being new dishes paired with new wines, nothing stood out. It was good and tasty. Throughout the night we smiled and shared stories. It was the perfect place to just \"be\" together.  I reserved the table a week out and asked them to seat us in an \"ideal view of the sunset.\" They sat us in front of these large window panes that faced south, but we couldn't barely see the west. I was bummed! I wanted our special night to be adorned with beautiful skies and memorable paintings by the hand of God Himself. But, I figure a classy restaurant like this must know what they're doing, so I took a minute, breathed, and really noticed how they set us in front of a scene was far richer in color than the sunset would have been, and I believe the staff knew exactly what they were doing when they sat us in that table. Our table sat above the secondary dining area, and with our elevated seating we overlooked the blue pools, the yellow canopies by the water, the white walkways streaming through the green trees of the grounds, and the red roofs of Scottsdale shingling all the way to the canvassed sky in the distant horizon. The view was crowned with purple stormy skies of the evening, with two rainbows decorating the rain clouds illuminated and glowing by the waning sun. It was a everything you could ask for... and it all eventually left us for the night.  Overall, we loved it. She loved it. It was the fanciest thing her or I have ever done in our lives.  After dinner we sat on the large balcony on cushioned benches warmed by the nearby fire, and watched the city lights twinkle in the distance, the planes flying into the night, the people below enjoying the pool. It was a relaxing way to top off a wonderful dinner.   And it was a memorable last night to end our time together, with everything you could ask for once again disappearing into the night.",

    "text": "I am breaking my general yelping rule, and giving a place 5 stars on a first visit. But this place really earned it this weekend. The BF were debating coming here for restaurant week after having gone to a different restaurant the night before and being super disappointed. I'm really glad we decided to go. The view was nice, we sat right by the window by the fire pit, so we got to look out over the city and at the fire...it was pretty awesome. The rolls were delish....they were almost croissant -y. I ended up getting the restaurant week menu and the BF ended up getting a cheeseburger (he had wanted one all day). I started with a ginger marg at the waiter's recommendation...it was sooooo good. It was spicy with ginger...I kind of loved it. Also, it turned out that most of my food had a ginger note, so it paired really well with my meal.  The BF had a nice pinot grigio, which paired well with his burger :-P. For an app, I got the butternut squash soup, which was a little gingery and not as thick as butternut squash soup usually is, but very delicious. For my main, I had the sirloin cap...it was awesome! perfectly cooked, and served with a puree that had a delicious gingery and fresh herb flavor. I could eat that steak anytime...it was wonderful. The burger was also delicious...it was thick and juicy, also perfectly cooked, and had really fresh veg on top and a really tasty onion ring. For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake and it was amazing...chocolate just oozed out of it. I liked that it wasn't too sweet, but had a rich chocolate flavor. I will definitely be back here, restaurant week or not!",

Everything we excellent except my filet which was to be cooked medium, it came out DONE, I mean really done as in grey all the way through. About half way through dinner the host came by and ask how if everything was alright I pointed out my over cooked uneaten steak. They offered to replace it but at that point everyone would have been done eating by the time it arrived so I declined. They were very prompt in removing it from the bill and the waiter apologized for it, I pointed out it was not his fault, kitchen mistakes happen so they handled it correctly. Over all we had a nice evening, the bill at $250 including drinks and tip was very fair and we will be back.",

The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because you can't ignore the view and all of the problems we had were recognized, owned and dealt with immediately by the Manager, Pat.  The service was the worst we've had at any restaurant.  Our drink glasses were removed and we weren't offered a refill or another drink.  They ran out of dinner rolls and offered us burnt sourdough toast (for real).  The food took forever to come out of the kitchen.  When it finally arrived, three our of four meals were wonderful.  We understand that a kitchen can be slow, but have the waitstaff who can offer customers the opportunity to not notice, by being kind and personable and apologetic rather than rude and afraid to talk to your table.  We would probably give it another try just once.",

The only reasons I'm giving 4 stars are two-fold:  The shrimp cocktail was overpriced - $18 for 5 shrimp? C'mon...yummy but lame.  And  The desert menu is seriously lacking - I was expecting to see at least one amazing thing and they were all boring: cake, apple fritter, cheesecake, gelato...boring!!  Other than that, everything was amazing. I'm getting over a cold and they brought me out my own tea kettle which sat next to the table and stayed hot for two hours. And the finishing salt they provided in a tiny bowl was a great touch!  Order a steak, it'll be cooked perfectly with a great crust on it. Have them bring all the sauces too; their bernaise is ridiculously fluffy - they infuse it with liquid nitrogen!!  And the beurre blanc is perfect and delicate.  YUM (PS, if you get Mercedes as your server, you're in for a treat! She's amazing!)",

Food was 5 stars (we had 2 of the summer specials and 2 of the tasting menu).  Waiter treated us to an extra dessert, which we didn't really need since we already had 4 desserts, but he gets props for doing something.  View was 5 stars.  Here's why only 3 stars: this is now the nicest restaurant on the property.  Phoenician.  Someone thought it would be a good idea to rent out the back room to a large group of the most productive Go Daddy salespeople, who were congratulating themselves for a job well done.  They were unbelievably loud!!!  Totally ruined the dining experience for the regular dining patrons.  Sounded like a frat party.  Couldn't hear conversation across the table.  Every minute there was whooping and cheering and napkin waving that only got even louder every time the door was opened.  Waiter assured us it would get quieter when their food was served.  Nope.  No manager came by to check on us or he/she would have gotten an earful.  I'm not optimistic that anyone at the Phoenician will even comment on this, but suffice it to say that what could have been a 5 star night was reduced to 3 stars by this loud group. They should have just closed the restaurant for the night.  Did I mention that this is the crowned jewel of the Phoenician?  Very disappointing.  Too many other high-end dining experiences begging for business in the middle of the summer in Phoenix.",

We started off with the caesar salad [$12] which is a shareable starter along with a piece of their infamous bread. Enjoyed my (~19 oz) Rib Eye [$64], cooked just the way I wanted (med). The meat was so juicy and the marbling on it was spot on. The 8 oz Filet [$49] was a little overcooked (asked for a med, got med well), but my partner still enjoyed it. Although she did say she's had better steak... Opted for the J&G sauce which was a mixture of everything as our waitress said. Tasted similar to A1 sauce, just less commercialized. We ordered the sauteed spinach [$10] & the asparagus [$10] which were both \"okay,\" nothing outstanding. Our waitress Ula was great, very attentive & even gave us a little surprise for our anniversary. The free dessert was chocolate molten lava cake w/ice cream. Absolutely decadent & one of the best parts of the night. Overall it was a lovely restaurant and experience.",

It had a basil fondue which was to die for. It's hard to describe, similar to pea soup but creamier and richer.   We also ordered the \"Black Truffle Cheese Fritters\" and the \"Ginger Margarita\" but I was not a fan of either. The margarita was far too sweet, and the fritters were nice and nutty from the truffle oil but were ultimately miniscule cheeseballs. I wish instead we had ordered another \"Charred Corn Ravioli\", yum! Highly recommend!   There are multiple seating options. You can sit at the bar, by the windows for a view, in the lounge area with couches, in the dining room, or outside on the wrap around balcony. Really loved all of the options, made the space seem more dynamic and fun! And the hostesses were very hospitable and nice!",

I mean you get up for the restroom and they refold your napkin, seemed weird at first then I realized it's how they keep their restaurant better than everyone else. Very formal. Our waiter Jeff was wonderful.  The food excellent. We had, filet mignon, NY steak and the salmon. All delicious.   We came a bit too late to see the outlook but it was wonderful. Fire pits at night, the resort pool lights change colors. So beautiful.   Pricey, so I can't afford to be back until another special occasion lol.",

Calamari looked different but was very good as well as the Pork Belly had an excellent presentation and was as good as it looked.  10 oz Prime 6 Peppercorn New York Strip Steak (reg $44, $10), 16 oz Lamb T-Bone (reg $44/$10) and the 12 oz Filet Mignon Steak (reg $57, $15) all were of the finest cuts of meat, tender and juicy. The Peppercorn New York Steak was excellent and a wonderful tasting of beef. My 12 oz Filet Mignon was thick and juicy, as it was cut the juice just oozed out.  For our dessert we shared the J&G Cheesecake Cranberry Compote Quince Sorbet and Warm Chocolate Cake Caramel Ice Cream. The cheesecake was very good as was the sorbet but the warm chocolate cake with caramel ice cream was difficult to pick over.   For just having a make over recent, decor looked dated, service was top notch, did not seem like our waitress did much but take our order and give us the bill, but the other people were there for everything.",

The sides were beyond spectacular. Enough for the three of us to share.  After dinner, a beautiful dessert was served along with a complimentary dessert.

I was relieved to see that they did a remodel which is beautiful (as it was looking rather tired) I believe it was a recent addition. The view and ambiance was fantastic and the staff was very attentive. I like how our server wrote our order on a little check pad (very back in the day) I appreciated it. Our group started with several shrimp cocktails and it was good and fresh (it's shrimp cocktail) you know what to expect. Calamari with basil salt had a good taste but I felt was too battered and the lemon dip I didn't care for, squeezing a lemon over the top was one thing but we all felt the dip made it slightly too tart. ENTREE...19oz Ribeye, the GOOD news is that it was prepared as requested medium rare the BAD news is that it was served on a cold plate. I prefer a hot plate, I will take a lukewarm plate I'd even settle for a room temperature plate.....but put a hot steak on a cold plate???? The steak also came with a variety of sauces, maybe it's just me but I don't think a prime steak needs any accompaniment so bringing it out without ordering it I felt was a waste. Asparagus with LEMON zest was good, broccoli with LEMON Parmesan mixed with my lemon sauce in the calamari I was about up to my ears in lemon. Side was very good macaroni and mushrooms I was just happy to taste something without lemon in it. Dessert was okay and they have good coffee, I thought about ordering tea but I was terrified they would bring me a lemon wedge and I'd have to run out of there screaming. BOTTOM LINE, the Phoenician sits smack between great steak houses on either side down the street, while it was fine I'll stick to those!",

Beyond expectation, this feast was incredibly delicious, comfortable and I did not regret paying $125 per person for this experience. Staff let us dine at a leisurely pace and attentively kept our beverages full while we enjoyed our feast over looking the balcony.  I decided to forgo most of the traditional offerings and pursued the caviar, raw bar and far fattier and less healthy options such as deep fried quail (delicious), pork belly, and no less than 6 desserts.   Luckily, the newly renovated lobby was a nice place to digest before heading home for Black Friday shopping. As every outing to the Phoenician, this was a truly memorable event and always fun and relaxing.",

    "text": "I was on here trying to figure out what to wear. I am confirming that I had jeans with a nice button up shirt with dress shoes and was fine. There was guys with t-shirts and jeans to guys in sports coats and suits. Most of ladies were slightly dressed better in dresses. Everyone was comfortable and there was no attitude.   Restaurant week always makes me smile about finding new places to feast. So we enjoyed a great 3 course meal at J&Gs on Friday night. We arrived a little early, taking advantage of the Phoenician free valet and bellied up to the J&G bar. Julie was our mixologist. I tried their signature Manhattan Cocktail ($15) and the Mrs. had a glass of a Spanish Red Wine ($13). Julie always had a smile and was great to ask about the restaurant and about her favorite places locally.   We had a 7:15 reservation and they kindly seated us with drinks in tow. David took over as our server. He was on it. He knew that we were there for the restaurant week menu and suggested their specials in case we were interested, but no pressure.   I had the Grilled Shrimp with Avocado and Asparagus, the Caramelized Beef Tenderloin, Charred Favas, for main course and Warm Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert. The Mrs. had the Warm Beet Salad with Yogurt as a starter, the same main course and Mango Upside Down Cake, Basil Ice Cream for dessert.   These little plates are gonna fill me up? Oh yes! Grilled Shrimp and Asparagus were awesome! I even tried the beat salad - Gooood! The Tenderloin was amazing cut, cooked perfectly! I liked the Mrs' dessert better. Something about the crusty cake and Basil ice cream, it was amazing.   Dave was there to check on us and pour wine and even banter with us. Top that off with a romantic setting, a big booth to ourselves overlooking south over the valley, We will def be back!",

Overlooks the mountains and has fire pits and all. it Made the dinner so much better just with the view. I had the 8oz filet, my dads gf got the salmon and the three men got the 12oz filet. Everyone was very impressed and said their meals were amazing. Sides mash potatoes, spinach, and mushrooms great choice.The service  was outstanding and they were very polite. Even though it was pricy it was worth it for a night out of great steak :) thank you j and g!",

We went out for drinks beforehand and were surprised to learn that many locals did not know about the steakhouse.  The restaurant is located near the top of the Phoenician and had a beautiful view. All of the tables in the dining room were set up so that you could see the view during the meal. We went at sunset- it was beautiful. The food was delicious, though pricey (it's what we expected) and the service was impeccable. I would recommend J&G for a romantic date or for a special occasion.",

We ordered the Kobe tomahawk chop which came 40min after our salads and was lukewarm in temperature. I could hv sent it bk but we were hungry by that point. We overheard a table of 4 complaining about their late arriving dinner also so I wasn't being too picky.  The view of the valley is great but that was about it.  We won't be returning.",

The steaks were very good, as you would expect from a fine steak house such as D & G.  I had a wonderfully prepared filet mignon, the steak was tremendous.  I am typically a bone-in ribeye guy but I am glad that I tried the filet.  The sides were all good, nothing spectacular but solid.

    "text": "The only reason I am giving J&G a 2 star is for the awesome waiter service we received last Friday night. We'd a party of 5 and the service was impeccable. Our server was exceptional.  We all had the tasting menu ($60) with the wine ($35). The wine portions were generous. However the quality of the wine was not good.   For starters we'd a tuna tartar which contained ginger and sesame sauce. The ginger was too over powering and the tartar had too much avocados. The pairing for this was a Riesling which was good.   The second course was a risotto with a wine from Alsace France. The risotto was ok and a bit salty. Nothing special. The wine was horrible. It tasted like flat soda that left a burning sensation in my throat. Kinda like drinking scotch with flat ginger ale. We told the waiter and he confirmed that the wine was off without saying it. He compensated us with a glass of Chardonnay which was ok. The waiter also gave us an extra glass to compensate for the poor wine. This is the reason why he was a good server.  The third course was a Chilean Seabass with black beans. Seabass is a very delicate fish and should never be paired with beans or anything with rough texture. This is a horrible combination. To top it off, the seabass tasted like it was frozen. The fish was not delicate at all. Why did I know this?  I was at Ocean's up in Scottsdale the night before and had a real Chilean Sea bass. This dish was so bad I completely do not recalled what the wine was...  The final course was a petit filet which they cannot possibly screw up. It was tender but nothing special. I believe it came with a Cab which was ok.   Given the amount of feedback we've provided to the server and one of our friends didn't like the chocolate cake in the prix fix menu as a dessert, the server gave us a sampler of desserts and a port to end the evening. Desserts were so so and so was the port. However, the server made a genuine effort to satisfy our needs.   Jean-Georges Vongerichten needs to pay closer attention to this restaurant along with his Vegas steakhouse as both sucked. At this rate, someone should take away the Michelin star from his NYC restaurant.",

Our service was terrible partly because our server had too many tables (7 or 8 tables is a lot to handle and give good service). We waited 25 minutes before our server took our drink order. The quality of food was average at best. I am not a \"salt\" person and never need - or want - to add salt when I'm eating a restaurant. Most of the food needed salt!! The $35 halibut was boring and bland - literally it had no flavor. The steak was ok (expect for the fact that it wasn't cooked the way I ordered it). The server never asked how our food was until it was time to clear our plates. He didn't even great us when we arrived so I didn't get his name. The best part and the reason for the 2nd star was the the warm chocolate cake we had for dessert. Don't waste your time or money. Overall, under spiced and over priced!",

    "text": "I thought that Restaurant Week would be the perfect opportunity to come in and use my gift card... but as soon as our server described the specials there was one that my husband had fixated on. The Tomahawk! For those of you who don't know, a tomahawk steak is basically a large bone-in ribeye, in this case portioned for two. Even though the waiter offered to let me order from the RW menu even if the hubby did not and my husband graciously offered to attempt to consume the entire steak himself, I reluctantly put the restaurant week menu aside and prepared myself for... The Tomahawk!  I started with the chilled corn soup which was fantastic.  I would not have expected the lemongrass and corn flavors to work so well with each other but they were perfect together in creamy broth and just a hint acidity from the tomato garnish. The presentation was also lovely with the fresh veggies arriving in the bowl and the broth added tableside. The hubby started with a Cesar salad that he thought was just ok. He was more impressed with the potato gratin we picked as our side... I only got a couple bites of those but they seemed pretty tasty. (tip: order at least one side dish per person b/c portion sizes are small).  The best part of the meal was, of course, the steak. Our server wheeled it out to us on a cart topped by a large cutting board. He expertly carved it off the bone and sliced it up for us, neatly spitting it onto two dinner plates. At the end of this production he also offered hubby the humongous rib bone to gnaw on; this he received as a child would a long anticipated gift from Santa Claus. The meat was wonderfully tender and flavorful. I also really enjoyed the trio of steak sauces that accompanied it. We finished off our meal with a slice of cheesecake to share. The cheesecake was not the best but I liked that it came with a quenelle of sorbet on top. Very different. That tangy fruitiness really complemented the glass of AZ Stronghold Rose I had ordered. I also had a glass of Malbec with dinner that was only $9 but quite good. I am happy that they had a few options from local wineries and my hubby was also glad he was able to order a Kiltlifter.  The food and service were all excellent. I am not sure how I feel about the ambiance. Something about it reminds me of Vegas. Maybe the Cosmo-esque glass chandeliers?  Or the huge windows a-la-The Mix? Or maybe just the hip, upbeat music and younger good-looking crowd. Either way, the only complaint I have is the price. If you go, make sure you are prepared for sticker shock... or else be smart and order off the Restaurant Week menu!",

    "text": "One word - Disappointing.   I decided to take my husband here for his birthday and because they were also participating in restaurant week. Also, they have great happy hour specials on Thursdays. Perfect.   First, I had requested on my reservation to seat us in a great seat with a view since it was a special occasion. They sat us in the back of the restaurant. Next, I ask for the happy hour menu and our waiter says happy hour is only in the lounge. So we couldn't get any drink specials which was annoying. Then we were brought out some crusty old stale rolls that were cold and hard and I immediately sent them back and requested fresh ones.   I ordered from the restaurant week menu and my meal was great. It is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. My first course, the shrimp was a little overdone but had good flavor. 2nd course, my steak was cooked well. 3rd course, cake topped with mango and the basil ice cream was delicious.  My meal was not the problem. My husband ordered a veal porterhouse which came out looking like a big pork chop. Upon inquiring to the waiter, he told us veal turns white when cooked...what?! That is just flat out not True. I think our waiter was new on the floor because he was not knowledgeable about the menu (or steak in general) and just was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fb.s.ing&s=2b7abc84a004bfeffe8f2aceaf59a78f755578d751760dd1e1374a1b2b0f843f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">b.s.ing</a> his way through all night.   I didn't like any of the steak sauces. Too bitter or too sweet.   To top off the evening, our waiter took FOREVER to bring us the check.  I'm usually not a nitpicky person but when I'm spending $120+ on dinner, it better be well executed, delicious, with great service.  There are plenty of other spots in the valley to get a GREAT meal at that price point. Will not be returning.",

We were 1 of 3 tables in the whole restaurant (Monday night), so even though its a moderate sized place, it felt very intimate.  My cucumber gin martini was delicious and refreshing, he also enjoyed his beer.  We decided to skip any kind of appitizer and go straight for the main courses. While waiting for our order w/ were offered the softest, warmest, tastiest rolls weve ever had. Then came the food. Oh. The. Food. I had the roasted lobster w/ fingerling potatoes and peas. A pound of fresh Maine lobster shipped in that morning? All for me? YES PLEASE. Needless to say, it did not disappoint.  My hubby had the 6 peppercorn sirloin (which was cooked perfectly and delicious) w/ the black pepper condiment and the J&G steaksauce. He preferred the pepper condiment, I preferred the tangy steaksauce. Now, since J&G is a fancy schmancy steakhouse, they offer all their sides (when ordering steak) ala carte. My husband ordered the salt and pepper baked potato and the mac and cheese, thinking that theyd be small portions. Lucky for me, they were Good sized portions, perfect for sharing. They were both delicious, though the mac and cheese had a faint lemon taste to it which we both found odd.  Then the dessert. Mind you, at this point we were both STUFFED to the gills. Somehow we made room. We both had the icecream and sorbet. My husband took a double scoop of their ginger ince cream (which is more ginger snappy than actual gingery) and a scoop of their almond, I took a scoop of their ginger icecream, one of their strawberry sorbet (which reminded me of strawberry italian ice), and a special scoop of their blueberry. Our water (Greg?) also overheard us talking and he and his trainer offered us a choice of one of their nightly dessert specials (so sweet!). We tried the pear cake w/ pear sorbet and spice ice cream (all 3 were to die for).  Speaking of our waiter, we would have never known he was in training if he hadnt told us. he was super professional, courtious, and informative. Bravo to his trainer!  If you have the extra $$ to spend for a special evening out, I throughly recommend going here. the view wasnt bad either. ;)",

I haven't had the pleasure of a meal in the dining room, but I have had appetizers in their beautiful lounge a few times.  They have a lovely shellfish platter, and I love their mac 'n cheese.  Not as big of a fan of the calamari, but it's only because I like a very crispy calamari so I forget I'm eating squid.  They actually choose to have the flavor of the calamari come through.  My husband LOVES their oysters, however.  Unfortunately, they are priced per oyster ($3+) and he will order at least 2 dozen.  Drinks are expectedly pricey, too, but very good.    So don't go to the bar expecting to get out cheap, but you will get out happy.  And the last time we were there, the kitchen came out offering comped desserts.  I guess they saw our bill before we did:)",

He kept forgetting things.  Then he missed 2 people's order altogether.  They kept promising the meal in a few minutes with no luck. Then they brought out the wrong meals.    The waiter was the main issue.  He was never sincere and took forever to apologize.  I would pass until they can get their service levels up.",

It was a great birthday! We sat on the patio, which overlooked an amazing view, and got to cozy up next to each other. Our waiter was friendly but didn't hoover and let us enjoy our time together.  The food was fantastic. We got the brussel sprouts to share then I ordered the filet and the husband got the ribeye. Both were super tender and flavorful. (Husband said one of the best he's had recently.) For desert we ordered the tiramisu and J&G also brought out a special birthday treat - a chocolate lava cake. Both sweets were tasty, but the tiramisu had frozen crystals inside - like it was frozen then thawed. Overall, we had a good time and will be back.",

We sat in the bar both times because cool environment, but we had the same bar tender wait on us and we felt like we were an inconvenience to her even though we were the only couple in the bar.  She was more interested in talking with her fellow employees than helping  us. Hopefully when Marriot takes this over, she will not be here .   On the reverse side, Ahmet in the lobby bar is awesome and is doing a great job with his staff",

It's a good thing, too, bec. in the end, we found that this place wasn't ostentatious nor that pretentious.  Dressed casually, we still managed to have a good time, despite the overall lackluster dining experience.  First off, let me say that the service could pick up their heels a bit.  By the time we received our expensive alcoholic beverage choices, more than 20 minutes had elapsed.  ($15 for a glass of Cab and $11 for a tiny glass of mimosa?  Are you serious??)  Our first plate, a sub-par Caesar salad, arrived close to an hour after we were seated.  But perhaps the fault wasn't entirely J&G's... Digestif's Caesar salad pretty much demolished all other competitors, I'd say.  How about I testify that tonight's salad was crispy.  That's saying something nice, right?  No flavor, no creamy eggy goodness, but somewhat crispy.  The decimated croutons didn't help the situation...  For the entree, we had the skirt-steak & frites.  The latter weren't any better than what you would find at McDonalds'.  (Seriously, I'm not making this up.  Just check out the photos and you'll see I'm all about the truth!)  But the skirt steak!  This baby wasn't much to gaze at, but it was tasty.  Let's just say it was delicious enough for me not to cry over the expense we spent that night on a barely-touched salad, a cheap cut of steak, three beverages, and tip.    Now onto the star of the show... chocolate cake w/ caramel ice cream!  Wait for it... homemade caramel ice cream!  And chocolate-lava cake shaped like a star.  Oh. My. Freakin'. God.  This should be renamed \"Foreplay.\"    Nice ambience, despite it being darker than I would like and that we were seated far away from the panoramic views.  I appreciated the privacy, though.  Women's restroom was clean and orderly, and walking past little caches of wine bottles was a nice touch.  The grounds looked pretty, but I was more impressed w/ the property at The Arizona Grand...",

The chef even whipped up a quick snack when the group's selections did not meet my dietary needs.  Superb service made me book an Easter dinner reservation.  My mom and I dined here tonight and were thoroughly impressed.  She ordered the tasting menu and I had the Easter menu.  Every course was excellent, though it was quite a bit of food.  Our views were spectacular, service was on point (they even switch out your place mats when they become a bit messy).  I ordered an extra side, the potato gratin, and when it didn't appear with our entrees, the server immediately apologized and expedited the order.  We were not charged for this and it was beyond delicious.  The manager stopped by to ensure we were enjoying the evening.  I loved everything I had, the pea soup (vegetarian, I checked) was decadent and the green color was phenomenal.  The tuna tartare was spicy, but not overwhelming.  I loved my strawberry pavlova dessert and its fresh and light flavors.  I recommend this to anyone who likes great food and great service.  I am most likely booking a dinner here for my parents' upcoming anniversary.",

Service was awesome, and the crowd was pretty mature.    We started with the calamari and a round of Kumamoto oysters. However, they mistakenly brought us Hama Hama oysters so we ended up getting a second round of oysters on the house!    I recommend any of the following steaks for your entree: rib eye, porterhouse, peppercorn NY steak if you like it peppery. From the sauces, I enjoyed the bearnaise and the miso mustard cause I prefer heavy/creamy. Others in our group found the spicy chili sauce interesting. The house steak sauce was *yawn* boring.    For sides, the standout was the creamed spinach. The grilled mushrooms and mac n cheese lacked oomph. Wish we ordered the potatoes au gratin instead. We glanced at the dessert menu, but we were too stuffed. Although I was impressed when our waiter informed us that the warm chocolate cake was invented by Jean Georges himself. If only we had saved room for dessert! If only we hadn't received the free round of oysters!    After a decadent meal here, DEFINITELY enjoy a little sippy on the patio. There are comfy cushioned seats around the firepits with the stars above and the Phoenician pools below. The perfect end to the perfect meal.",

Upon taking our seats, we were treated to a breathtaking panoramic view of Phoenix as the sun set.  If you want to shoot for that experience, take a 5:00 PM reservation in late-December.  The designers of the restaurant did a wonderful job.  It lends intimacy to the experience.    Dining options were worthy of the occasion-- breaded shrimp \"cocktail\", French Onion soup, wedge salads, steaks, fish, fresh rolls, and lava cake or red velvet cake dessert plates depending on the choices.  Not a single complaint (though I couldn't finish the red velvet cake due to eating so much and its richness).  Take a moment to get some pictures of your group on the balcony and to commiserate by the fire on a cool Arizona Winter's night.  Afterward, if you have kids, go downstairs for Christmas story time with Cavalier Spaniels, to take a picture with Mrs. Claus, and then listen to the professional carolers.    Self-parking is a breeze and the Phoenician's staff seems to always be exceptionally helpful and kind.",

On the other hand, it is overpriced, not the best steak in town, and feels a bit like the hotel restaurant it is.    We went late one night but were seated next to a table with babies/toddlers (at 8:30pm), so had to ask to be moved.  They were out of the rib eye and so the server recommended the bison rib eye -- neglecting to mention it was $50.  It was also a bit flavorless, dry.    Sides were okay -- creamed corn and asparagus were good.  Wine list is extensive, but again way overpriced.  I'd recommend going for happy hour to enjoy the sunset, but not necessarily stay for dinner.",

We attended this place on July 3rd and had a reservation at 9:00.  I requested a booth a week in advance, but they couldn't even accommodate that.   Let's just get straight to the review.  Food/Service  Our waiter was no were to be seen most of the night.  We ordered a few drinks and couple of appetizers to start.  Black Truffle cheese fritters and calamari.  Both were ok, and the portions are a joke.  Most nice restaurants serve some sort of calamari dish and for what you pay here is down right insulting.  There were probably 6 to 7 pieces, seriously WTF.  For dinner we order the Filet Mignon and porterhouse steak.  My fiancee requested it medium well and I wanted my steak medium rare.  Her steak was served rare and mine was overcooked on the medium well side.  SMH.  Our sides were a potato gratin and creamed corn dish.  Once again they serve it in a little dish and the flavors were nothing special.  Our waiter said he would bring us out bread, but that never happened.  I had to request my coke to be filled up several times and had to stack the dirty plates for them to finally take it away.  Seriously, where is the customer service?  I snapped couple of pics, didn't even want to waste my time, but posting anyway.  Not the most memorable nice dinners I've had in a while.  For the food that they serve they are not an elite or top steakhouse in the valley.  They are more like a Keg's Steakhouse, Longhorns, or Flemings.  For a great steak and experience, I would recommend Mastro's, Dominick's (Scottsdale Quarter) or Donovan's.  Report Card=F!!!",

If you can sit by the window it is especially panoramic. The noise level is low and the crowd subdued. It got a little loud in the bar but hey, it's the bar!  Solid wine list and extensive cocktail list. They carry Buckler's NA which is an indicator of their attention to detail and diner preference.   She had the Caesar salad and I had the pork belly appetizer. Both were excellent but the pork belly was incredibly flavorful. The mix of flavors is interesting and very good, very good!  She had the Parmesan crusted chicken and I had the filet. The chicken was good though a bit dry. The steak was excellent and served with a sampling of house made sauces that were very interesting in and of themselves. We shared a side of au gratin potatoes that were rich, creamy and just incredible.   We skipped dessert but they have an extensive after dinner drink and dessert menu.   What needs to change to make it a 5 star restaurant you ask, well the servers were constantly reaching over us. They apologized each time but kept reaching all the way across us to retrieve dishes and glasses, not sure why but it was annoying. The service was jerky or kind of disconnected. There were long stretches when we couldn't get anyone's attention and short stretches when we couldn't have a conversation without someone interrupting us or reaching across us. The food makes it all worthwhile though, outstanding!",

    "text": "Dined here during Restaurant Week, Spring 2017.  Food was amazing. Had fresh oysters along with cocktails and beer prior to the appetizers.  I couldn't get enough of the gazpacho; it was so flavorful and with a surprising kick to it. Also tried the angel hair, which I initially thought was odd to serve as a starter, but it was so good. The noodles were definitely fresh and the pesto was so good. I was definitely blown away by the appetizer dishes.  The sea bass was also enjoyable. The couscous looked dry at first but I was proven wrong with the first try, along with the tomatoes had such a good tang to them. The fish was nicely cooked. The flavors worked really well together. Overall, it was a well constructed dish with such good, solid flavors. Also tried the grilled flat iron, which was ordered medium rare, but came out within the medium-medium well range. It was good, but I was expecting more from a steakhouse.  Dessert was solid. Had the lava and cheesecake. Pretty good.  Service was great. I would definitely return again to explore the rest of the menu, along with that gazpacho.",

Service was fine, but almost too casual for the upscale-steakhouse feel and especially for the price tag.  The food left a lot to be desired. The steaks were fine (we're from Texas so maybe that's why we weren't super impressed), the sides were ok, but the steak sauces (especially the J&G signature steak sauce) were not very good.  We were treated to a free congratulatory dessert that was so so kind of them and really delicious, so that left our night on a high note, but we were overall disappointed with the food and atmosphere for how much it cost.",

It wouldn't have been so bad if there weren't less than 20 ppl in the restaurant & a couple who was seated AFTER we ordered our food was served their food 25 min before us. They also had steak! Lol! Our waiter never came to offer any explanation or recognize the wait, until we sort of grabbed him rushing by & then he offered an apology & went to see why. I always order my steak medium so that wasn't the reason, but whatever the reason, which was never given, I won't be returning, there are toooooo many other GREAT steak houses in Phoenix!",

    "text": "The fact this restaurant rates so high is perplexing, but I am more surprised Jean Georges has an affiliation.  The price is definitely JG, but the quality and menu are lacking.   So, first what I liked: Staff were friendly and generally attentive. The view is nice.  The veal chop was excellent.   The sauces were good as well.  However, two people at our table ordered steak, one rare and the other medium rare, but they both came out rare.  Cardinal sin.  There is no fixing this situation.  If it is sent back everyone else has to stop and let their food get cold or finish their meal by the time the steak returns.  The bigger issue at this restaurant is the antiquated menu.  Straight out of the 80's. Tuna tartar, crab cakes and fried calamari?? You're joking, right? What they couldn't squeeze coconut shrimp or potato skins on the menu?  What's worse the plating has zero appeal. Look at some of the pictures in other posts, specifically the pork belly.  Basic.  It also was not very good - If this were the first meat dish I had, I would be a vegan.  The steaks were placed on the plate with 3 peppers, no thought at all.  I am not asking for a blooming onion on each plate, but for the price it needs to look better than Outback.  As I said before, the people were friendly and that goes a long-long way, but to be accurate there were points in the evening where I felt forgotten.  If everything else were on point I might ignore this oversight, but it wasn't and for the price this should never be the case.  Lastly,  the Phoenician and J&G need about a $40m-$50m remodel.  This place felt tired.    Change the menu, remodel the restaurant and give me a reason to come back.",

    "text": "A dinner here is a terrific experience in all respects. (To truly make an evening of it, you'll want to start with a cocktail or four in the Thirsty Camel lounge downstairs.) Upstairs, the sleek bar makes great cocktails and has vases of fresh herbs at hand to add the extra sparkle. Service is very smooth and accommodating; I've always been made to feel very welcome and I've always had the impression they really care about providing a great dining experience. And of course, the view over the valley from this high perch is pretty amazing. As this is a big dining room, of course not all tables are going to have the up-close windowside view, so you might want to come on an off-peak night if you're dying for that. There's plenty of space in the bar area to get a nice long look if your table is further back. On my most recent visit, I had the signature charred corn ravioli in a basil fondue ($11), and it was heavenly as always, and the perfect size for an appetizer. I followed that up with the NY steak, a perfectly-cooked (medium rare) 10 oz portion ($39) that came with a choice of sauces. I picked the sweet onion-chili, which was a great tangy/spicy combo. After I had placed my order, I decided I had a hankering for some melted bleu cheese on the steak so I asked the waiter if they could accommodate. It was no problem and very nicely done. For dessert, I had the ice cream and sorbet selection--and you can choose your combinations and how many scoops you want to customize the size. For a restaurant of this quality in a resort this well-known, and with a name-chef as the owner, the prices are pretty darn reasonable. I can eat better here for less than I can at the Ruth's Chris at home, so I really can't find fault here.",

But first I did start with a drink from the happy hour menu.  I tried the Vanilla Italian Soda.  It was so good that I had two.  We then tried the mushroom eggrolls and the dipping sauce.  We also tried the slider.  It was fresh, but only okay.  We also tried the beef skewers that were pretty good.    We then tried the tasting menu.  The first dishes were the tuna tartare.  It was amazingly flavorful.  Then came the risotto.  I would go back for that dish alone.  We also had a steak and fish.  Both were delicious.  What really surprised me was the dessert.  It was a chocolate cake with carmel ice cream.  It was quite light.  I really can't wait to go back and try more of their menu items.    The service was also great!",

Romantic ambiance with extraordinary city lights and has a outside patio with fire-pits which add to the views. Very nice long bar, well stocked with premium labels.  Martinis served in old fashioned round martini/champagne glasses. Perfect Sapphire dry martini. The Jumbo prawn appetizer was a little limp, passable but expected better from this 5 star restaurant....maybe difficult to fly in fresh prawns on a daily basis. However, everything else was perfect and the aged Ribeye exceeded my expectations. You will not be disappointed. Very flavorful, aged, grass fed and lean but very tender. Selected the Faust. A big red cab out of Napa.  Probably the best value on the extensive wine list and it came in a split so you can enjoy more than 1 wine label. BTW, If you are fan of Quintessa....its in the family. The standard sides are shareable so just have each person order 1 side and share.  The cheese au gratin  is like candy.  The Cinnamon Apple Crumb was the coup de grau paired with a 10 yr old Port. Kudos to Jeff........superb service. Definitely go again......would have given 5 stars but the shrimp........",

We had spent a week at the Phoenician and were told that a discount was offered, as in all restaurants at the resort, to children that order off the main menu. I thought delayed and poor service was because we were receiving a discount. In the end...service and attitude was just not good. Ordered a bottle of wine and saw the waiter open and taste my wine off in another area before I received the first taste. In all my years of wine tasting, have NEVER seen the waiter tasting my wine!! 2 steaks had to be sent back...not cooked to medium rare. Obviously this didn't make them happy because they sent them back rare. When I received the check I found no discount. After questioning about discount I was offered a minimal amount off the check. I'm ok with paying full price for a great steak...but don't do well when lied to. If a steak place has to lie to get you in the door...they're not a 4 star restaurant.  Shameful...and a poor representative of the Phoenician.",

The decor is understated luxury and the service matched that of any fine restaurant in the world.  I will strongly agree with the sentiments of the Sweet Corn Ravioli - worth a visit on its own!  If steak is what you're craving, you won't be disappointed!  In a town full of quality beef option, J&G ranks at the top!

We arrived at our designated reservation time of 7:00 PM but the restaurant was not very full. It is a beautiful place with one of the best views in the valley. It's modern and classy at the same time. Very comfortable atmosphere. My husband had a beautiful floral arrangement waiting at the table for me. We started off by ordering two of their specialty drinks. The Ginger Margarita ($12) and a special Kumquat Mojito. Both were very good. We were informed by the General Manager on a table visit that the Ginger Margaritas are the only drink that is in all of Jean-Georges restaurants worldwide. I ordered the tasting menu for $58.00, which gives you smaller portions of the following food items: Tuna Tartare with Avocado, Sweet Corn Ravioli in basil butter, Halibut with Miso Yuza glaze and Bok-Choy, Grilled petite filet with J & G steak sauce, sauteed spinach, french fries, warm chocolate cake with Carmel ice cream. My husband ordered the Porterhouse $60.00 with a side of mushrooms. They did give us a complimentary dessert of cheesecake with cherry compote and sour cherry sorbet. My husband enjoyed his steak even though he had to send it back to be recooked. My steak was also undercooked but I ended up taking it home so I did not send it back. The steak was not served sizzling hot and the glaze on the Halibut was very spicy. Service was average nothing to rave about. They did make an exception and let me order the tasting menu as I was informed by the server this menu is usually reserved if everyone at the table orders it. I think they wanted to make our anniversary special. I've had better steaks but I gave them four stars since they did go out of there way to make our evening special and the view is fantastic!",

The decor is inviting and the view is relaxing. I had high hopes. The menu has something for everyone- steak, of course, seafood and chicken. For a prix fixe, $35, you can have a 3 course meal which I think is pretty reasonable. Both myself and my dinner partner ordered the lobster which was only okay as it was a tad bit overcooked. You may be wondering why I gave this restaurant only 2 stars. Well, I've never had such bad service ( well maybe at McDonalds). Our waiter took our initial order and we hardly saw him again. His assistant, whom he never even introduced, came by to offer additional rolls and eventually take our dessert order. For example, I ordered a glass of wine but no one ever asked if I needed a refill instead someone just took my glass away when it was empty.  We did make a comment to our waiter about not seeing much of him and were met with random chitchat-- very odd.  In the end, the manager came over and we expressed how we felt. He was VERY apologetic and took one of our lobster dinners off our tab. So that was nice.",

    "text": "I'm throwing 5 stars at this one. I thought the restaurant week menu was a steal. Everything tasted great. One thing to expect, they put some type of acidic sauce or dressing on the steaks. It was similar to whatever they drizzled on the asparagus appetizer as well as the asparagus risotto. I thought it tasted great but we did have a discussion at our table that a True carnivore could be thrown off by addition. We tried some of the side sauces and nothing was that great. The peppercorn recommened by our server was probably the best because while it was deep and rich, it still had a sweet flavor. The house steak sauce was too dark and bitter for me. And the soy mustard was great on the salmon. Speaking of salmon, damn, I've never tasted a piece of salmon that didn't have that strong salmon flavor but this salmon, was delicate, not strong flavored at all, just perfect. What separates this steak house from the others is that we seemed to enjoy every course. The notable exception would be the bread. They don't hold a candle to the popovers at BLT or the duck fat fries at Bourbon Steak.",

    "text": "I had my first visit to the J&G Steakhouse as a part of restaurant week.  Overall the experience was very disappointing and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The meal took over three hours because the time in between courses was at least a 30 to 45 minutes.  This would have been more bearable if the food was worth the wait but while it was cooked perfectly the flavors were unremarkable.  I guess maybe because it was the fixed menu for restaurant week but rather than showcase their best dishes in order to ensure a return visit, they did the opposite and ensured I will never go back to this restaurant.  The flat iron steak was chewy and dry and came served with a side of french fries that would have been more appropriate next to a Big Mac.  The tomato soup was drizzled with truffle oil - a good idea in theory - but the truffles were so overwhelming that it was all you could smell or taste.  And the service was terrible.  I was served a drink and a glass of water when we sat down and not again until I hunted our waiter down before dessert was served and asked if we could please get refills.  Then, after my boyfriend told him he did not want another drink because he was driving he brought him one anyway.  When we got the check, we found out that this extra drink was $40 and we were being charged for it!  To sum it up, I miss Mary Elaine's.",

    "text": "My husband I went to J&G Steakhouse last night and loved it! We had an amazing table with a dramatic view of the Valley and a very knowledgeable server, expertly pairing wines at the drop of a dime.  I wanted to try everything but decided on the Fois Gras appetizer and Dover Sole for dinner. It was delicious. The Fois Gras was like nothing I have ever had in the states. The Sole was so fresh and cooked to perfection. My husband enjoyed the sweet corn ravioli and the Prime Rib for dinner. He was extremely happy with his meal.  As if that wasn't enough food we ordered the onion rings and steamed broccoli as sides with our entrees.  One of the best things about this restaurant is you can go for a fancy romantic dinner or for a gourmet cheeseburgers and fries while still get to enjoy the exquisite views of the city and amazing decor.   With all the new steakhouses taking root in the valley, J&G definitely stands above the rest.",

    "text": "This place deserves 5+++++ stars.  I must admit...I went in there with low expectations thinking it was just ANOTHER steak house with a killer view and yet very mediocre food. What a pleasant and delicious surprise. I don't usually dwell on the decor but this place is an exception.  The restaurant has such expansive view of the Phoenician grounds that you almost have to take deep breath and take it all in.  Interior decor is done very subtle and soothing without sacrificing elegance.  We sat by the panoramic window and it was very nice.  Eh Em...now.. on to the the food.  Foi Gras appetizer is a sure winner and had a very interesting & original presentation.  I appreciated that.  Hanger Steak...you're thinkin $18...probably will be just bleh. NO WAY!  It was cooked to perfection, juicy, flavorful, tender and just darn GOOD!  It also comes with 4 different sauces so you can explore a little bit.  Service was more than adequate without being intrusive.  Granted there are no ballet trained waiters pirouetting around you like French Laundry.  However, I did had my napkins refolded each time I got away from the table and my water glass was never more than half empty.  The manager came by and checked on us...a very nice touch.   I absolutely loved this place.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "J&G is SO close to getting five stars from me, and I'm pretty sure they will once they've completely worked out all the kinks. For starters, they have a stunning dining room -- stark, modern, and hip while also dark, classy, and elegant. This isn't your grandfather's steakhouse, but it's not some Scottsdale scene-over-substance place either. From the fifth floor of the Phoenician, they also boast gorgeous views of the city. But on to the most important part...the food. Everything we had was spectacular -- sweet corn ravioli, chopped salad, filet mignon, crispy spiced onions, and exotic fruit salad for dessert. My main complaint is that nothing came out very hot - the ravioli, steak, and onions were all just warm. But I'll deal with my steak being just warm when it's this amazing - not an ounce or gristle or fat, just pure tender beef, like butter, perfectly seasoned. And at $28 for 8 oz. or $36 for 12, the best steak in the city might also be the most reasonably priced! Another minor issue is the service - while our waiter couldn't have been more friendly and helpful (kindly offering to take back our chopped salad and remake it with a different dressing when we didn't like the dressing it came with), some of the courses took quite a while to come out. I'm all for fine dining restaurants pacing a leisurely meal, but this was beyond leisurely...it was slow, about 2.5 hours total. All said, this was a wonderful experience, and I plan to be back MANY more times for the amazing steaks and more. And why not, when the price is right?!",
