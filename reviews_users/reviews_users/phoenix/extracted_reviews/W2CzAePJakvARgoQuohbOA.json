Its not as if I don't like the place, but my sales manager about pissed his pants when we spotted the restaurant. If he is happy, I'm happy.",

She said she'd make sure our food was brought out to us.  She asked the tables around us the same thing.  When our meal was ready it was brought to our table.  No other In N Out has done this but it was really nice.   It kept the kids from getting up from the table when the adults usually get up to pick up the food.  The restaurant was clean.  Food was delicious.  The staff was working together to keep it that way.  I'd definitely go back to this location.   There were a lot of college students dining there... small groups and couples.",

Most people will get the animal style and be adventurous however I am a real plain Jane and stick to double meat and double cheese in a lovely slightly toasted bun, perfection!

    "text": "Wow, this In-N-Out was packed to the gills on Friday night! Despite it being so busy, there wasn't any wait to place our order, and there were still seats left for us to enjoy our meal. Even though they were slammed with orders, we still got service with a smile. Our order didn't take too long to get made, and soon we were enjoying our cheap yet tasty burgers.  I decided to go out on a limb and try something completely foreign to me in the realm of burgers- protein style (Substitute wrapped lettuce for bun)! I had it with cheese, and also animal-style. I shared some fries, well-done (i.e., they are fried twice instead of once), and a fountain drink.  The burger with no bun and lettuce wrapping was quite good. the crisp, fresh lettuce was a good complement to the hot grilled burger patty and condiments. Despite it being wrapped in the requisite paper pouch, it was still a messy meal as the lettuce does not soak up any of the grease and sauce like a regular bun will, so as I ate more, the paper got soggy and juices started to run down my hand and arm. While I really enjoyed the burger protein-style, I think a single patty just isn't enough for me, since I was still a bit hungry after chowing down so next time I will try it double-double!  The fries, when \"well-done\", are a whole lot better than their regular style. Frying them twice made them quite crispy, and the extra frying adds more flavor to the potatoes. I do appreciate that they use freshly cut potatoes though!  They are open late at this location- Until 1:30 A.M. on the weekends and up to 1 A.M. other nights.   Overall, a good way to start the end of your work week right!",

I recently came to this location and ordered:  Cheeseburger Animal Style, $2.25 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ#K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w#EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n...</a>  French Fries Animal Style, $3.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ#MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n...</a>  Small Soda, $1.40  The Cheeseburger was perfect....had all of the flavor that I've come to love about In-N-Out.  The Animal Fries on the other hand were terrible....they were cold and chewy.  Unbelievable, because they cook it fresh....they must've left this order on the counter while they finished by Burger instead of giving me a fresh order of Animal Fries.  It was a little disappointing because I normally have a 4 or 5 Star experience at an In-N-Out.  Oh well, maybe I caught them on a bad day?    Return Factor - 60%",

    "text": "Typically, I would shy away from writing a review on a fast food chain with 290 locations. However, the In-N-Out experience is anything but the normal fast food dining experience. I am always impressed by the consistency of the In-N-Out Burger experience.   The quality of their never frozen beef patties and fresh, made-to-order burgers is excellent and their customer service is always prompt, efficient, and wonderful. The staff is always courteous and happy--it's good to know that I am supporting a place that seems to treat their employees well.   The inexpensive burgers and fries always hit the spot--I only wish there were locations outside of California and the Southwest to satisfy my fast food burger cravings. But, I suppose staying within a manageable driving distance of the distribution centers is what keeps the food high-quality, fresh, and preservative-free.  My go-to is the protein style double double burger (no bun, just a hearty lettuce wrap around patties that are oozing with cheesy goodness).  When I want to try a variation on my favorite, I just consult the \"Not-So-Secret\" menu on the In-N-Out website!   If you have not been to an In-N-Out burger, I strongly recommend visiting this wonderful fast food place! Expect a long line and short wait, but if you are a fast food/burger lover, you will not be disappointed!  Fun tidbit: Look for the bible verse references on the paper products. Just noticed this after my umpteenth visit to In-N-Out Burger!",

For example, the meat is prepared fresh everyday, so it will taste delicious. Also, French fries are prepared well everyday and it's the most fresh French fries I have ever eat. Second, I think the quality of service at in-n-out is high. For instance, the workers there are friendly. Finally, in my point of view, the price of range is low for a student. For example, all social classes can eat from it. In conclusion, I advice everybody to try it and I hope you like it.",

    "text": "INTERNAL MEMO   To our valued employees, You are the most integral part of what makes our company wonderful. We want to continue to show our appreciation for all that you do, and that includes the overwhelming number of suggestions we received for our upcoming 60th anniversary.   The management team must admit the diversity and scope of the ideas surprised us, but we feel that it is reflection of our talented work force.   For example, the suggestion that we close our indoor seating to mimic how our original store in 1948 would serve customers is not feasible. In-N-Out now operates in locales which have inclement weather compared to Southern California, and we believe our customers value this change. Moreover, many of our stores are so busy as to displace a significant amount of our customer base.   Along those lines, we are also are unable to implement the suggestion that we separate our customers into two separate lines, one marked \"colored\" and one marked \"white\" despite how common this was in 1948. In-N-Out's popularity already ensures that lines are often long, and tests the patience of many consumers. We also are uncertain that our African-American, Asian-American, and Latin American customers would find such a decision compatible with In-N-Out's desire to remain inclusive to the largest market share possible.   We also are opposed to adjusting our current portion size to what it was in 1948. It is our opinion that customers would probably notice that we have made our buns bigger, patties thinner, and cheese oilier over the years. Moreover, it is the position of management that importing soft drinks sweetened without corn syrup may be a violation of US law and therefore an unacceptable risk for the company.   Lastly, we believe that lowering our prices to those charged by In-N-Out in 1948 is also not feasible. We believe that such tactics are the sign of desperation and not the hallmark of a healthy and aggressive brand and company. Moreover, this might be viewed as a In-N-Out conceding it is no longer the bargain it once was. The management team strongly disputes this, recently price increases notwithstanding. We also have reason to believe that such a move would be viewed unfavorable as we explore our potential IPO next year.   In closing, we continue to believe that our employees are our greatest asset. We thank you for your input on this momentous occasion in our company's history and encourage your feedback in the future. Sincerely, Your Management Team",

Fast food places aren't known for their well-spoken and friendly teenage work force, but In-N-Out always feels a cut above.    Their menu is very simple.  You can have a double cheeseburger, a cheeseburger, or a hamburger.  They all taste great, and the fries are made while you watch.    There's also an unwritten menu at In-N-Out that has developed over the years.  If you'd like sauteed onions, pickles, and extra sauce on your burger, ask for your burger to be prepared \"Animal Style\".  I know it sounds goofy, but the cashier will know exactly what you mean- and it's amazing.  If you're in the mood for a burger and fries, it doesn't get much better than In-N-Out.",

    "text": "Ok, so first things first, this is a pontless review, I mean you most likely have your opinions set already, but if like me, you move Westward and have always heard of the mythical in-N-out, I figure this might be of use to you. A) it's a chain fast food joint. So set your expectations there. Do I have a favorite burger place? Yes. Is it a fast food joint? Why no, no it's not. Neither is it this FAST (hence the name fast food eh?) or hve a drive through, or so handy after a long day dragon slaying and I just want to get back to my cave and prop my feet up. So lets dispense with the silliness, this place is what it is, it's cheap, surprisingly cheap, fast... usually VERY fast (unless there's a hella rush) Service so friendly that it's almost scary!   As for the food, the meat is decent quality for a chain and fresh, not frozen. tasteless lettuce fresh and crispy for texture, and onions either grilled or fresh cut, your choice. Now to what I tend to order... yeah they have a secret menu, and I've played with it a bit, but I only tend to go when tired and haven't planned in advance, and since I don't care enough to memorize the secret menu, all i know is \"animal style\" which isn't bad at all, adds a bit of flavor and messiness to the burger, although I only had it the once. The buns are fresh, as are the fries, so i find that they benefit from extra toasting, order them both \"well done\" I find that especially for the fries, it makes a world of difference. The well done fries are much better than the usual ones.More texture and crunch etc... As for the burger, i like fresh onions, so add lots of those, and they have never let me down.   To the people that view the animal style fries as gross because of the way they \"look'? So what? How do they taste? and if it just wasnt for you, then fine, but I have never had them myself, and cant imagine I would ever order them because they looked good (or good for you!) I mean figure out the ingredients, art for the eyes was never the point! I want to try the animal fries myself, i just haven't.   If my fast options are Chick-Fi-Lay/Panda Garden/In-N-Out/Hardee's (Carl's JR out here)I would probably go for one of the burger joints, with the awareness that the entire meal at In-N-Out would cost what the burger at Carl's costs, but sometimes I don't go for cheap, and some Carls are decent.)  But as long as your expectations are reasonable, your not gonna be disappointed by the In-N-Out food.Even if it isn't what you like, its good stuff for what it sets out to be.  Might try that DQ burger a earlier review mentioned if the situation arrives.",

Of course my first stop for food was to InNout right after my flight landed. Please dnt judge me because i wasnt the only one making this trip from the airport lol. I actually seen a group of people, who i assume ubered to InNout because they wheeled their luggage into the store.   Now on to the food. For some reason I fancied this location more, than the one in Dallas. We all know Texas is the beef capital but for some reason the burger tasted better in phoenix. It was so delicious i could have cried tears of joy biting into that burger. The freshness of the meat and the lightly toasted bun with the animal style goodness is just pure bliss. The animal fries are just heavenly!!!!!! I just cant understand who wouldn't love this. Only bad part is that i thought it was a good idea to eat outside and the of course melted my milkshake with in 2 minutes. Thanks 95 degree weather .  Other than that if your in the tempe or ASU area stop at this location its worth the wait and the staff is always friendly giving great customer service!!!",

I love the retro feel and friendly service and quick lines always make it a positive experience.  My favorite thing is the shake - but burgers seem to be the most popular item for obvious reasons.

I highly reccomend dining in rather than taking it to go simply because the fresh cut fries are likely to get cold and soggy quick.    If you're adventurous, try getting your burger or fries \"animal-style\", while it's not on the menu the employee working the register will know what you are referring to.  Animal style consists of melted cheese, special sauce, and grilled onions, simply delicious.    Another great menu option is the protein-style burgers where the bun is replaced by crisp refreshing lettuce.    Finish off your classic American meal with one of their three thick milkshakes!",

In N Out is fast food, but its the most fresh and flavorful burger I have ever had, and for some reason, even the bun tastes better than at most places.

I'd see such excited social media posts with lots of pictures any time someone ate at one of these restaurants, which seemed no different than any other fast food burger joint. That's why I hadn't bothered to try In N Out, despite living in Arizona for the past 7-8 months. I must say, after visiting this location on a late Sunday afternoon, I have a better appreciation for this place. Not even taking the food into consideration, I was very impressed by how many staff members were working at the time - legitimately working. Everyone was seriously busy the entire time and providing excellent customer service. The restaurant looked very clean and I liked the transparency of being able to see right into the kitchen. Nothing was \"hidden\". Where else do you get to watch potatoes getting cut into fresh fries? Also, they seemed to really care about the presentation of their food. Which by the way, my cheeseburger was very good and I liked that I could get the onions sauteed. As a first-timer, I found the menu a little confusing (despite how completely basic it appears) because my friend was explaining all the crazy ways you can order. It's like a secret language I don't know - but want to learn. I kept it very simple this time, but would definitely come back here before ever going to Burger King or any other similar place ever again.",

    "text": "In the word's of Spongebob Square Pants, \"I'M READY!\" After ten months of more Mcdonald's than I've probably eaten in the past ten years, I'm ready to leave Australia and return to my home country, the meca of fast food.   Though, I am an avid fan of the New American cuisine (vegan friendly & fair trade) I WANT SOME MEAT. I've made a list of all the fast food spots I plan on hitting up upon arrival back to the states.   This list reads as follows:   1. In N Out 2. Whataburger 3. Wendy's 4. Taco Bell   As you can see, In N Out's my number one and this is simply because it's the best. It's funny to see that Mickey D's isn't even on the list when I shamefully admit that my roommates and I eat there maybe once or twice a week.. gross, I know.   Last night over a double hamburger, fries, and a sundae all for 9 dollars, I began explaining In N Out to my house mate. In N Out isn't a place you go for just anything, most people know exactly what they like and order just that, time and time again.   Though the menu is small and simple the big tastes explain it all. The patty's aren't large in any way but the fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion combined make their burgers hard to get a proper bite in your mouth all at once.   I'm not the biggest fan of the fries so I usually opt away from them and snag a couple of my friends though I have come to In N Out alone before (which is not pathetic on any level). So yeah, like I said I get the same thing every time switching back and forth between their delicious lemonade and milkshakes. The good thing about this location is the Yogurtland in the lot right next door. So if you ever see me around the Grigio, dont be surprised if I head over for some dessert after my 'gourmet meal'.  Note for vegetarians: If you're a vego you can order off the secret special menu. This menu is not spoken about, kinda like that guy on Harry Potter who's name shouldn't be said out loud. If you know about the menu and order it theres no problem but there's no chance you're getting an employee to tell you about it! Sorry, I won't be sharing their secrets here but if you're interested definitely look up their secrets online!  Since I've been living in Australia, I've realized how condiments aren't that big over here and find it frustrating how they charge you 50 cents for dipping sauce. Sometimes I can't be bothered spending extra on sauce since even Macca's is an expensive meal but baby do I love me some sauce. In N Out's, Special Sauce is so delicious and definitely worth the extra money for a packet. Though its probably just a mixture of mayo and ketchup (kinda like big mac sauce) it's an essential add on.   This is fast food but you shouldn't expect it to be quick and easy. Every time I go to In N Out, there's a drive thru line through the parking lot. Thankfully, they've got employees who wear goofy outfits standing outside with Ipads sending your order in when the drive thru is like this.  I understand I may have gotten peoples hopes up but I suggest going into your first In N Out experience with low expectations. I was honestly so dissapointed after my first try at an In N Out near LAX maybe Arizona's In N Out's are just better? I think I had just gotten my own hopes up but whatever the reason was for it to be so bad, I swear after my second try I became addicted.",

For me it was hyped up way too much before I went so my experience might have been a little bit of a letdown, however the burger I got was pretty good and tasted fresh. ***make sure when you order the fries to ask for them \"crispy\" or else they come out pretty soggy and do not taste that good at all. Also you might want to check out the \"not so secret\" menu online and look at other options you have when ordering. Please don't forget this place is a Fast Food joint so don't expect a gourmet burger, just an affordable burger that might be a slight step above some other fast food joints. Oh and the menu has only a few options (no chicken sandwiches just burgers and cheeseburgers as well as fries and shakes).",

Their menu is relatively simple with prices similar to other chains such as McDonalds but with MUCH better quality in food.   I ordered the Double Double - Animal Style. This is a burger with two meat patties which, usually, I would think is too much meat for a burger. After my first bite, HOLY. MOTHA. COW. Juicy burger with crisp veggies and a soft toasted bun rounded out with creamy thousand island dressing. Nom NOM! Definitely a 5 star burger.  My friend got fries which I thought were pretty meh. Next time I come I'll definitely try the Animal Fries which I've heard so much about.",

Being from Chicago, I think my expectations for burgers was a bit higher and I had heard so much about this place, but I was let down greatly by the cheeseburger I got.  On top of that the best way I can describe the fries were that they tasted like someone had tried to rip off McDonald's fries... but they were stale and not hot. Gosh, those fries were icky. They ruined my appetite for the burger and had me wanting to drive to McDonald's just to have a different taste in my mouth.  I can say that I would never go back here. I'd rather hold out for some Portillo's because In and Out was a huge disappointment.",

In-N-Outs are pretty consistent across the board, but I was a bit disappointed with this location, hence the -1 star.   My go-to order forever?: 1 cheeseburger, grilled onions, chopped chilies, medium rare. The guy at the counter told me they don't do medium rare...  Um... \"...\"  I don't see why they won't (or wouldn't), but I just said \"Ok\" and went about my day. While it temporarily filled the hole in my heart where In-N-Out goes, it was merely satisfactory, not outstanding (so yes, on your elementary-school-like report card, In-N-Out of Tempe, you get an \"S\", not an \"O\").

To be honest, I don't like the shoestring fries, which seem to go stale in a hurry and are a bit dense for my liking. But it's okay, because the burgers, with mustard and/or a special thousand-island style dressing more than make up for it.  The beef tastes fresh, and it's seasoned lightly. And I think the buns have a light coating of butter or oil, and they're wonderfully soft to boot.

I only went to In-N-Out Burger because my daughter wanted to eat burgers for dinner and I had made a deal with her earlier in the evening about it. The guy who took my order while waiting in the long drive thru line was really nice. However when I got to the drive through windows things changed. There was no one at the first window and I did not happen to see a sign for paying there, so I kept driving to the next window to pay and get the food.   When I got to the second window I was greeted with a dark haired Latina looking or Asian girl with thick glasses and bright red lipstick and no smile who said \"You did not pay.\" Naturally I did not know what to say because I was going to pay for my cheap junk food at the second window. So I said \"Can't I pay here?\" I'm not sure if she thought I was trying to steal food or if she was trying to discipline a disobedient kid.  \"No you cannot pay here you have to pay at the first window!\" And I said I would like to just pay here, and I had my card in my hand and she said \"No you have to pay at the first window.\" At Dutch Bros and Starbucks people pay and get their food at the same window so why does In & Out Burger have some sort of autocratic drive thru situation? It was super weird because it seemed like she was asking me to physically get out of my car and go to the first window, or back my car up or something. Keep in mind I have already been waiting in line for about 15 minutes or more. Finally, after trying to humiliate me for not paying at a different window, she took my card and ran it, even though it must have been super inconvenient because she had to walk to where the first window was.  She, or someone, should have apologized for the act she pulled. Now I know why I don't go to fast food places anymore, and it's the shitty attitude of employees, not the bad quality of the food.",

Lets just say thank goodness there's a GPS and map app on our cell phones nowadays or I might have starved to death in the desert.  This location seems to be easier to get to from everywhere.  (For outsiders, don't let \"Tempe\" fools you, it's closer to Scottsdale and Phoenix than the other ones)  I was told of the not so secret secret menu. So I went and got a cheeseburger animal style. We ordered one order of fries to share and a milkshake. The fries is big enough to share, and is the less impressive item.  Don't know if it is as lightly fried everywhere else, but I like my fries crunchier.  The most impressive thing is the price.  My cheeseburger was $2.20.  It's not a huge burger but it filled me up just fine.  The entire meal was just over $10 with tax for 2.   The menu is simple. And the amount of employees with their cute little white uniforms and the hats are abundant. So even though it was packed the service was fast.   Guess I am now on the In-N-Out bandwagon.  Now if they can open one up in my neck of the woods...",

No matter what location you visited, you knew your burger would be delicious and the service was the industry standard. After what I witnessed at lunch today, I can safely say that torch has been passed to In-N-Out.  I've known that In-N-Out makes some of the best burgers anywhere, for years. They do it by focusing on one thing and doing it well. And they cook them to order. The former king \"assembles them to order\".  Today, at the In-N-Out north of ASU, I saw a well oiled machine in action. I pulled into a packed parking lot with a full drive-thru. I walked into a lobby that had just a couple seats left. And while I waited for my order, I watched the line stretch out the lobby doors. No one got upset or impatient. No one left or complained and they were all served in a timely manner.  How does this location manage to attract the crowds? You can't see it from the 202 until you're passing it. You can barely see it from Scottsdale Road. (Hint: Their reputation.)  My \"protein style\" (no bun) Double-Double and fries were freshly prepared, hot and delicious. And the service is impressive for its friendliness and competence. Lunch today was as busy as I've ever seen in any fast food restaurant. And the crew at In-N-Out handled it like it was any other day. Long live the new king!",

Maybe that is how the regular customers like  their french fries or I just happened to be here on an off night  for french fries.  Since I was hungry, I ate the french fries anyways.",

People certainly love this place, and it really has a huge following. Students, in particular, are devotees of this chain. The prices are renowned for being affordable as well. The question then, is whether the taste meets expectations.  Food: This place doesn't make me feel sick after eating. I think that in itself makes it a winner. I'm not a huge fast-foodie, but when I do go out, I'm willing to grab a burger here. The burgers aren't massive, but they're flavourful. You don't need a ton of sauce to make one their patties appetizing. You can ask for onions, but don't. The onions here are strong and will light your intestines on fire for the rest of the day.  Fries are good, and it's fun to watch them chop the potatoes up with that massive fry-slicing machine.   Service: I've always had good service, which is impressive given that they're always incredibly busy.   You can always find a better burger joint, but for a fast-food burger place, In-N-Out is my go-to.",

The menu is not complex, but you CAN get some special orders if you're not a newbie!   I always get the same thing and it never disappoints. I get the double double combo which includes a fries and a drink. If you're a True Cali local, you get half lemonade, half sprite. For some reason, it's the best drink to go with your burger and fries in my opinion! The milkshakes are actually not that great there mostly because I always feel like they're room temperature when you drink them, and they're so thick that you can't actually drink it through a straw. Then again that's just my opinion!   Here's some tips that you didn't know about 1) ask for grilled onions instead of normal onions. They're a lot better 2) ask for grilled peppercinis. If you like a little kick of spice, these are worth it. Not a lot of people know about this for some reason  3) animal style is awesome, but ask for more \"thousand island\" dressing once your Oder is done. What happens with my fries is that I always eat the top with all the melted cheese and stuff, then I end up just having regular fries",

Dining Environment: We opted to eat outside and quickly changed our minds. There was bird poop on a couple of the benches, and none of them looked like they had been cleaned recently. We moved inside and several tables were not clean as well. Note that this was around 4:15, so it was between rushes.   Food: Ordered the Double-Double, fries, and a drink. Very reasonably priced. They put a lot of sauce on the burger at this location, which I appreciate. Food tasted better than my last visit, but I don't remember the lettuce looking anywhere near this bad. Nearly inedible, so I chose to take a picture. Definitely doesn't look like how they advertise their lettuce.   Overall: If you need a quick bite to eat at a cheap price, this place gets the job done, but the food quality can definitely vary.",

The first thing you notice when you enter the restaurant is the retro interior design which gives the vibes of the 60's in California. You will also notice the classic red and white In-N-Out menu above the cashiers. The menu itself is simple and only consists of couple of items. This allows them to focus on perfecting their burger.   The restaurant was packed and there was a long line, but fortunately, thanks to their exceptionally fast service, I did not wait that long in the line. I ordered the standard number 1 order which consists of double cheese burger, fries and drink for $3.60. a very good deal!   The place was pretty clean and we received our food relatively fast. My hamburger was freshly prepared, hot and delicious. The juicy meat combined with the cheese and the sauce is the perfect recipe for happiness! the fries were decent. There is nothing special about them, they were just normal fries. In-N-out is hands down the best and cheapest burger you can get in town, I never was disappointed by them. [204 wds.]",

I went through the drive-thru (which always has a huge line) but my food has always been hot and fresh even after sitting in that line for 30 mins. I got my food, drove home (less than 2 mins) and i was about to eat my food when I felt the burger patties were ice cold! And my fries weren't even hot or crispy, they were a lukewarm disgusting soggy mess (and I get plain fries). I literally had to heat my burger up in the microwave before I could even eat it. Even then, it still didn't taste that great. I didn't even eat my fries because they were so soggy and mushy. Then to top it off,  my 7-up tasted like mold for some reason. I looked inside the cup and I didn't see anything, but maybe their ice machine needs to be cleaned out (I used to work in fast food). To say the least, I was extremely disappointed but I'm sure I'll be back because it's USUALLY really delicious and super close to my house. But I would recommend not going through the drive-thru especially on a Saturday night, and eating inside so you can make sure your food is hot and fresh.",

I ordered the cheese burger and side of fries and to my surprise I could taste the potato in the fries. LOL I guess I'm only used the fries tasting like grease so this was actually pretty cool to me. Back to the burger - the meat was cooked just right but I think what makes their burgers so special is the toasted bun! Yeah, I know I'm supposed to say the meat patty but I think the secret really is in the bun. It was perfectly toasted and didn't get soggy from the tomato or juicy burger.  Have I joined the In-N-Out-Burger cult? Uhm, no not just yet but I'd be willing to bet if I had another I might just cave.",

The burgers are good, don't get me wrong, but they're nothing like what some people make them out to be. And what's with the lack of condiments? Blasphemy! Oh, and \"spread\"?!? WTF is this garbage that you're trying to pass off as an acceptable substitute for the variety of burger toppings that, for reasons I'm unaware of, aren't available here? Whatever this crap is, it's nasty.   Fries are average, and their shakes are ok (mine was a bit thin and runny). Reminds me of a low-budget Steak'n'Shake, which has MUCH better shakes and a lot more variety on their menu. (if only I could transplant one of these bad boys from the midwest...)  Again, even after eating here numerous times, I still fail to see how this place could even come close to living up to the hype. Sure, the whole \"secret menu\" was a genius marketing gimmick, but this place is mediocrity at best. If I want the best possible \"fast food\" burger, I'll go to Culver's which is far superior and gives it's patrons what we deserve...some freakin' choices!",

East-coasters! Gather 'round and let me describe the wonder in terms that ye all are familiar with!  The best way to describe this place is with comparisons to other fast food places. The most relevant are Shake Shack and Steak 'n' Shake.  It's burgers are very similar to both, but probably more so to Shake Shack--they're pressed thin, with almost \"crunchy\" edges.  Natives love to order off the \"secret menu\" or whatever (Google it), but I just got a regular burger with extra onions as well as fries.  These burgers are good, but not as good as Shake Shack.  Whatever (incredibly unhealthy) sauce Shake Shack puts on their burgers really just makes them heavenly, and In-N-Out just isn't QUITE on that level.  Very comparably quality-wise with Steak 'n' Shake burgers.  The fries are great, but at the same time, not so great.  As a friend so aptly described them, they have a very detectable \"cardboard\" quality to them.  You'd think that would make them horrifying, but in reality all it does is make them slightly subpar compared to the competitors.  The cooler they get, the more this quality becomes obvious.  Order them for yourself if you want to understand--they're still quite decent!  Most importantly, although In-N-Out doesn't quite cut it compared to Shake Shack, it's like, half the price.  If you're not bougie (or rich) and want a regular fast food place, In-N-Out is where it's at.  For the price, it can't be beat.",

    "text": "Of fast food burger joints few places are as well known in areas where they have absolutely no store presence as the chain \"In-N-Out Burger\". While visiting Arizona on a business trip I was aware In-N-Out Burger was a fixture in the area, and it had been well over a decade since the last time I had stopped at one.   Since my first pair of visits to In-N-Out Burgers in California in the early 2000s, I've seen people wearing In-N-Out Burger shirts, read countless articles about the chain, and decided the next time I'm near one I'll give it another shot. My feeling in previous visits to In-N-Out was that while good, and inexpensive there was nothing exceptional about the food there. Would I notice something I didn't before?  When I arrived at my hotel in Tempe Arizona I was immediately able to spot an In-N-Out location and visited several times during my two week stay. On my initial visit I ordered a 3x3 which is three beef patties and three slices of cheese served \"Animal style\" which is with lettuce, tomato, the beef patties being mustard cooked; pickle, extra Thousand Island style sauce known as \"spread\" with grilled onions. I also got Lemonade and animal style fries which added spread and onions to the top of my fries. Overall, I thought the burger was very good, especially for the price, but that even with the spread the fries were a bit lacking.   My next visit I went in a slightly different direction, passed on getting any fries and just got a regular 3x3 burger without the animal style additions and a chocolate shake. I noticed that besides the lettuce, tomato and onions it didn't taste as different as I thought it would. I also obtained this through the drive-thru and was given a box rather than a bag, making it somewhat difficult to transport without spilling. The shake I had was excellent, and while I was in the area I tried vanilla,chocolate and strawberry shakes and all were good.  My overall opinion of In-N-Out is this, if you've never visited one it isn't the legendary once in a lifetime experience you may have heard about. However, it is very good for fast food and is quite inexpensive. The most unique characteristic of getting an animal style In-N-Out burger is that it is unique tasting. Nothing exactly tastes quite like an In-N-Out burger, the sharp onions and more sour than big mac sauce thousand island spread give the burger its character. It might not be the best tasting fast food burger ever, but it has its own identity. I am going to give In-N-Out four stars.",

    "text": "When in town for a wedding, I was excited to be able to try the famed IN-N-Out burger  animal style. Being an East Coast native I love 5 Guys little cheeseburgers and the peanut oil cooked fries doused in vinegar and wanted to compare for myself. I like the fact that is a drive-thru, so it really is a fast food restaurant. Prices are lower and they have milkshakes which I unfortunately I did not order, because I didn't want to go overboard on calories. Silly I know.  The verdict is that I much prefer 5 Guys over In-N-Out. Maybe I don't normally eat my burgers animal style so I wasn't comparing apples to apples, but I thought the fried onions tasted like the artificial onion soup packet. The fries were just boring and had no flavor and don't want to add a bunch cheese just to give it flavor.  I will try it again just to order my burger the way I normally eat them and skip fries and order a shake.",

You want to know the meaning of life? Get a double single with grilled onions and chiles and that should get you pretty darn close to figuring out the answer to that.

But since their burgers are great--I will keep them at 5 stars. This location, like many of their locations, is usually very busy. However, considering that they are right down the street from ASU (where everyone loves them) I think their level of busyness is understandable. I've never had to wait more than 7-10 minutes at this location and I usually have a special order and visit during peak times. Besides the fact that their burgers taste amazing (ask practically anyone, they'll say the same thing) I love how fresh everything there is--if it goes into your food it is fresh and never frozen. I also like the fact that In-N-Out Burger pays their workers well, it is refreshing to see a company treat their workers with dignity and respect.",

From a health standpoint, the food is fresh, but I wouldn't say this is something you should partake in everyday. The fries are made fresh for every order, and the burgers have this special sauce that is just oh so good. It is perfect for a late night binge after going out, be prepared to wait  in line, at almost anytime at both the  drive-thru or inside, both move quick, but your looking at a 5 to 10 minute wait time. I heard they have a secret menu, where you can order a veggie burger of sorts, plus other things off menu.",

Then again, you may just be looking to see what items to order to shake up your current order. So here's my favorite: grilled cheese...yes, they make grilled cheese at In-N-Out and they are oh-so-good! If you order just a grilled cheese it will come exactly like the cheeseburger minus the meat; they throw on all the same toppings. You can also order a grilled cheese-plain. This will be the toasted buns with a cheesy center of wow! I like to get one of each, one plain, and one regular minus the sauce and sub regular onions for grilled onions- so in a sense, animal style minus the sauce. :-) I also like their fries. I will get them animal style minus the sauce. You end up with a box of fries with melted cheese and grilled onions. So good! And the bottom half usually doesn't have toppings so you also get some plain fries. Wash it all down with a coke! All American Yumminess!",

I was pleasantly surprised by how efficient the staff runs this location. The line was not abhorrently long and it went by quickly. Service was good. They made the BEST chocolate shake I've ever had at an In-N-Out location.   Only downside is the nasty taste of cold fries. And it doesn't take very long for them to get cold! Also didn't like how the lettuce disappeared halfway through my burger :/ It was alright for the price, but I'll be sticking with SoCal locations.",

There was a line, it went quickly, I was able to order quickly and it was nice that they had a 1, 2, 3 menu choices of a burger, fry and drink.  I ordered the #1 Double Double, I have not had In-N-Out for many years!  Last time it was in Vegas years ago.   I also ordered a couple shirts, which was reasonably priced $12.99.  They came quickly delivered to my table.   My burger quickly was made and I sat down and ate, I had to smash it down, and it was huge!  It tasted very good tasting, meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese.  The fries were pretty good, but I was more focused on the burger.  My drink was good too, I had coke.  It is served in a deep red tray, workers were polite and helpful.  Overall my trip here was a pleasure.  Lots of parking and close to the airport.  Looking forward to coming back at one of their locations.",

We arrived at the same time as literally everyone else in the area and the line/ wait was so terrible- I was wavering on being hangry. I was so overwhelmed by how many people were in the restaurant that I hardly got to enjoy anything.  It was an actual battle (I'm not joking... I had to fight some arrogant baseball dad) for a table. People were actually standing next to us as we ate our food so they could claim our table next.  What I'm getting to is- if you don't have to eat in the restaurant, get this to go.  Food is mediocre and so not worth a super long wait. As we were visiting the area, I can't say that losing my business will make a difference, but my first In-N-Out experience will absolutely be my last.",

I mean $3.70 for a double double with grilled onions, tomatoes & cheese, you can't beat the price for the quality   I mean you can get better burgers, but for the price and quality In N Out is tough to beat.  Compared to the competitors in the same price range In N Out and one of the best price and quality burgers that's why there is always a line no matter when you come here.

I guess there are a lot of students that go here, so the drive-thru line can get long. One of my co-workers was nice enough to bring me back about 30 minutes later, and the wait was nowhere near as bad as my Uber driver had argued. We went inside to order and got out of there in under seven minutes.   Cheap? YES. You can't beat the prices. Friendly? YES. Unbelievably so, and I wonder if it's a cult. Delicious? YES.

They do as well as they can to get through the orders, but you can expect to wait 10-15 minutes for your food on a busy day.

This is a discussion I can't really win either way because both of these quality chains offer some things the other does not.  I always like the vibe of every In-N-Out - nostalgic, clean, jumping with activity, friendly, etc.  Five Guys has peanuts, fresh cut jalapenos and a trippy Coca Cola soft drink dispenser that is loads of fun and features a lot of blends you can't find anywhere else.  Their burgers are probably equally delicious although I lean very slightly toward Five Guys here because of the wider variety of available toppings, etc.  You can't beat the size of an order of fries at Five Guys which are always overflowing inside the bag in addition to the huge cupful they provide.  The fries at In-N-Out are pretty special too - always fresh, never frozen.  I don't know about Five Guys' fries although they taste spectacular too.    This location seems as good as any of the In-N-Out stores and I've been to quite a few in a couple different states.  Always consistent and high quality.  The kids who work at these locations are always bright, friendly and on top of things.",

No crazy combos or an endless list to chose from.  Except for you can add the secret menu into the mix.  Im from Texas where sadly there is no In-N-Out and even I know of the delicious secret menu! I always order my fries animal style!  Honestly, I wouldn't eat the fries if they weren't animal style, only because their fries are not super crispy like I usually like my fries.   With that being said, all there food is amazing and its all made fresh.    Yes, this location does tend to get busy, but they keep the line moving surprisingly really fast. No worries... In-N-Out will be in your tummy soon!",

    "text": "After hearing about In-N-Out Burger for years, I finally was able to try it while on a trip to Phoenix.  Menu.  I walked inside and was immediately impressed with the simple menu: hamburger, cheeseburger, double-cheeseburger, fries, milkshakes, soda.  This is a burger restaurant, so why should they clog the menu with lots of other things--if I wanted to eat chicken or fish, I'd go to a place that specializes in those foods.  The simple menu made it really quick to decide what I wanted to eat.  Service.  The counterperson acted like a genuine human being--not the typical, fast-food robot.  From this point on, the word \"genuine\" repeatedly came to mind.  Food.  The cheeseburger was very good, but not exceptional.  I was pleased to read that the patty was not frozen, as would be expected.  The fries--which they said were freshly hand made--were exceptional.  I can't ever remember having fries that tasted this good anywhere--really crispy.  The chocolate shake was very smooth--also made from genuine ice cream instead of some powdered box mix.  It was definitely better than any other fast food milkshake I've tried.  Restaurant:  The restaurant was cleaner than most fast-food places as was the bathroom.  Overall:  I would certainly be happy to eat at In-N-Out Burger again.",

Very nice and upscale buildings next door too, so the drive through line has been about 10-15 cars deep the couple times we have been here.  But the wait isn't too too long, but sure it worth it, IMO!",

When I got my food it looked absolutely delicious, but when you bite in to the burger, there is no flavor there to savor. The burger was very bland even with all the toppings that come on it. It was very disappointing. The fries were the same way and I understand they are fried in cholesterol free oil, but when you bite in to them there was no crisp about them, they were soft and chewy. Very cool decor and great service, but the food was very underwhelming. First and last time to an in & out.",

Anyway, I had a double double (meat, cheese & onion only) and it was delicious. I know I'm crazy for not having fries because the ones here are delicious, but I just wasn't in the mood.   Sure, the lines (both in the restaurant & drive-thru) at this location are always PACKED, but considering how long they can get I think they do a pretty good job of getting orders out as quickly (and accurately as can be). I had to wait less than 10 mins for my burger and I was in a line of at least 10 people w/a completely packed dining room.   I'll also point out that the bathroom was clean, which is impressive for a high volume fast food place.",

You can literally watch them make your order right in front of you, so you already know it's as fresh as it gets! The best part? The freshly cut fries! They cut the potato right there and toss is right into the fryer! Definitely not like other places where they purchased fries pre-cut and frozen. And since they're freshly cut and immediately tossed into the fryer, they're not and hot and crispy! However, for those that like that extra crunch to their fry, they can order it extra crispy and they'll make it that way for you! My friend ordered her fries that way, and with me being the type of girl who enjoys texture, it really hit the spot!",

The fries are great as well and shake great too. The menu is simple but that is In-N-Out it does a burger classic always consistent.   I can truly say the service is always quick, and the employees always seem to have the same positive energy when taking orders or asking if there is anything they can do.

I'm very happy that there are so much more locations in the valley compared when I was a kid back then. Almost there's most likely an in and out available nearby. I order what depends on my mood and it's either a protein style double double or grilled onions instead. I actually didn't really like In N Out as much as I do now and it's so addicting.  If you don't know the secret menu here, you're missing out. Reevaluate your life.",

It is what a burger place should be, a bunch of young teenagers who take pride in their first jobs.  $2 for a great cheeseburger, $6 for a combo w great fries and a milk shake is worthy of a last meal.  The burgers put the high priced burgers in Manhattan NYC to shame---Ray's Hell Burger wannabes.  In and Out is a throwback to a time when fast food was about quality and affordability.  This place qualifies for Hall of Fame All Madden status.  I miss those days after swimming in a meet or playing in a basketball game where we would go out for burgers and shakes.  It doesn't get better than In and Out!  Arizona Baby!!",

No matter how long the line is, they are quick at taking orders and moving things along. Regardless of how busy it is, I always have someone greet me at my table and offer to bring my food out. There is always someone who comes by and offers to throw away my trash as well.   I never expected this from a fast food establishment and at first just came for the good food. I find myself returning more frequently to show my appreciation for a good company and after many visits in the past 4 years I decided it was time to express my gratitude.

Had heard so many good things about this burger joint that I had to give it a try while traveling in Tempe AZ.     The burger was small and flimsy, which was finished leaving half the bun and fixings sitting there wondering whether it was worth eating a bun with lettuce, onion, tomato and \"spread\" by itself.  I ultimately opted to forgo the unnecessary carbs to focus on my fries.    At first I thought maybe I was tripping, but the fries tasted like salted cardboard sticks.  I had to pinch open the French fry, only to discover the hallowed center, which reminded me of my youth as a short order cook who occasionally double fried the French fries before I realized you can't refry fries if you want them to taste good.    Needless to say, my curiosity about this restaurant was met with severe disappointment to what started out as high expectations.   If the food was at the same quality of McDonald's, Burger King or Wendy's, I would have been disappointed, but I certainly wouldn't have felt compelled to write a one star Yelp review.   Now I'm left wondering whether this was just a poor isolated experience or if this is the \"Quality you can taste\" experience that is typical of this over-rated establishment.     In-N-Out?  I'm OUT for sure.",

Service was great the food is quality for fast food the people are always friendly and I love the french fries even though I can only eat them about once a year.  For a fast food joint I think nothing comes even close to In-N-Out Burger. If I didn't have to worry about gaining weight I would come here every day and then probably have a heart attack ha ha.  Five stars all the way.",

Now that you know where I stand I'll say this, I know why it has its detractors, I'm just not one of them.  First of all, the flavors are strong! They season the burgers with lots of salt and it comes through. Also some people hate the fries (my wife is one) as they are straight up potatoes that are fried and then served. They can be a bit on the limp side and are pretty starchy. I love them, but there are times I won't get them because they are a bit heavy when paired with a burger.   With that being said, I was in Arizona on vacation for five days and I ate there three times. So they definitely are doing something right in my opinion.",

Upon walking inside, I could see there were no available tables inside or outside to sit down and the standing room for carry out orders was shoulder to shoulder. Also, finding the entrance to this location can be a little confusing.   That being said, I proceeded inside to place my order (Plain Double/Double combo) and waited patiently with everyone else. Even though they were slammed, the staff was still friendly and I received my order in a timely manner (hot and fresh).   Since this is the closest In-n-Out to my work I'll more than likely visit again (just not during lunchtime on a Saturday).",

The second time I called, they apologized and said they'd look into it. About a month later I went back, I wish I didn't. Another facial hair in my fries. For the third time, that is just unacceptable. BEAWARE when eating here, if you're a regular I'm sure you've eaten many hairs without even noticing!",

I'll be honest and say that prior to driving here,  I looked to see if there was another location because I know this one is very busy.   The parking lot can be tricky.  You pull in and are immediately in the drive-through line even if you want to park. It's all good, just letting you know it's kinda crowded.   We went in... well, not at first because the line inside was right up to the door so we waited outside for a few minutes until the line moved forward.  My boyfriend asked if we wanted to go somewhere else.  I assured him that it would be quick and worth a small wait. Indeed, within a few minutes we ordered and sat down.  The food is consistently fresh and delicious.  The service is always excellent.  I've been going to In-n-Out for years and I always tell anyone who will listen about the excellent customer service.    So, in a nutshell, even though this place was so busy that we couldn't even walk in the front door, the experience was excellent and on par with every other visit to any location!",

I had a sense of dread, as I sometimes have the patience of a 3-year-old when I am hungry.   The line moved swiftly & efficiently. My brother grabbed us a table while I was finishing up my order. His order came out, but mine was still being made. A lady working there came up and asked if I was waiting for an order. I said I was, & she offered to get it for me. Then she brought it to my table when it was ready. I was like, \"what is happening here?\" to my brother. The great service was weirding me out a bit. Then as I was finishing, she came up to the table & offered to take it away for me! My brother had already cleaned his stuff up. I was convinced they thought I was a secret shopper or something. Granted I've been living in a country with horrible service for the last 4 years, so I think I'm just experiencing a bit of culture shock.

    "text": "Whenever I travel out west, I always remember the possibility of In-N-Out Burger halfway through my trip.  Fast food is not often on my mind but as soon as I remember that I have possible access to In-N-Out, its must-have-it-now stop for me.    Most recently, I was visiting a friend in Tempe and we were running errands.  I made her take me here.  This means I googled the location and then gave her turn-by-turn directions....there was no other option.  We arrived to a busy parking lot and an even busier interior.  I went for the gold.  That means I ordered the double-double animal style.  When in Rome...right?  Oh, it was all I hoped for and more.  Delish!  The freshness of the ingredients definitely makes a difference even if it just fast food.  Minus one star for the fries which were kinda gross.  I didn't even bother with them after like five fries.  Because everything is cooked fresh, the wait times are longer than your typical fast food joint.  Be prepared to wait a few minutes, but its worth it.  Service as this location was friendly, the place was clean.  When it comes to fast food burgers, this time it was a complete success!",

I can't be certain, but I know this location was clean, bright and staffed with friendly people who seemed genuinely happy to be doing their jobs. I think this speaks to how well the company treats their employees, but whatever it is, it makes for a great experience.  And ohmygod, the food. I make a point to go to In N' Out on any trip I make to the West coast. Each bite of a double double animal style is like taking a bite out of an angel's halo. And I will tear into the French fries like nobody's business, even though I try to avoid them at other restaurants...I mean, especially fast food restaurants. This is fast food at a different level.   Crowning achievement, the chocolate milkshake. Or get a neopolitan if you're feeling fancy. I will sign a petition In N' Out to come eastward. In fact, I'll knock on doors to get others to sign it too. Although this could make me quite fat. Let me rethink this.",

    "text": "This In n Out Burger was really good.  I love In n Out burgers because they are special to go to because there aren't any In n Out burgers in Colorado.                    In n out burger is a fast food restaurant so I didn't interact with the staff so much.  When I did interact with the staff the were super nice.  The woman at the ordering counter is delightful.  She had a huge smile on her face and was such a pleasure to be around.  A very nice man helped us carry our food to our table.  All employees were wearing white uniforms, all were clean.  Their hair was tucked up into white hats away from the food.                  I'm pretty sure you can guess what was on the menu.  Burgers! Burgers were delicious.   They had such flavor. I was very impressed with the fries.  They were made right there at In n Out Burger. In the bottom of the fry boat it said that since 1948 they have been cooking their fries in 100% trans fat free cholesterol free vegetable oil.  Their potatoes are peeled and diced  fresh at each store and are cooked fresh for their customers.  Fries can be very unhealthy especially if you eat them frequently.  However, I thought the fries could have cooked a small amount of time longer they  weren't under cooked they just weren't as crunchy as most fries.                     To be in In n Out burger is to be in In n Out Burger's ambiance. They have created an ambiance that says fast food.  The red and white colored building is a great place if you want to eat fast food.  it is a place where you get in and get out, not a sit down and relax place.  It is perfect for a hot summer's day when you need take out or a quick place but don't expect dinner! p.s. try the strawberry milkshake",

The meat on the burger is top shelf and the lettuce, tomato,  pickle and condiments are all fresh and add to the over all satisfaction.

Burgers are also amazing for a fast food chain. Shakes are mediocre and I wouldn't recommend getting them. In-N-Out's menu may look basic, but there are some hidden items on the menu. For example, get the Animal Style Fries and you can have that as a whole meal. The fries are covered in cheese, thousand island dressing, and onions. They are good but very heavy. You can get as many patties and slices of cheese as you want. Ask for a \"4 by 4\" and you will get 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese on your burger. You can even ask them to make your fries crispy if you like them that way.   PRICE: Best value in town! Burger, fries, and soft drink will cost less than $6. The low price and great food keep you coming back.   ATMOSPHERE: Typical fast food joint, nothing special. It can get quite busy in there though.   SERVICE: I think In-N-Out employees are really Carebears in human costumes. They are so polite and very helpful.   SKINNY: You don't know what you're missing! One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life, and the best deal in town for a good meal.",

Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasn't working.  There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husband's had a big slice of tomato.   Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close.",

The burgers are empty with barely any taste, the fries are always cold and leave a disgusting greasy film in my mouth, and the grilled onions taste like slimy slugs.  I want to like this place, I really do. I'm forced to eat it at least once every six months because every single person I know loves it and acts like it's Gods gift to fast food. (hence the psalms on the cups) This place is like fast food for elitists. \"I won't step foot into a McDonalds but In&Out is so indie and different that I'll allow them to serve me~\"  The hidden menu is what really gets me. Having \"secret items\" on your menu doesn't make you cool. It doesn't make your customers feel special or exclusive (unless they're idiots). It just makes me feel like you're too cheap to update the menu that you've had since the dawn of time.  Did I mention that there is ALWAYS a giant line? Both in the drive through and the dine in. Theres never a good place to sit and it's always packed. If I didn't know any better I'd think it was Club In&Out.  That being said, when I'm forced to eat it I'm unhappy but never physically ill like I am with another extremely popular place that I hate (chipotle). Also the employees are really friendly and service is pretty quick considering how long the lines always are.   I know I'll most likely continue going here with people close to me for the rest of my life but I would never pick it on my own or suggest it to outsiders.",

Are the burgers better than McD's and Burger King?  Of course, but that's like being proud of being the toughest kid on the chess team, or the most talented player on the Girls Basketball team. And compared to other locations this one takes forever.  The last time I was there a friend was in from out of town and had never had In-N-Out.  We were two of 6 customers in the entire place and it took 15 minutes to get our food.  After taking a few bites of his food his exact words were, \"why did we wait 15 minutes for this?\"  It summed up all my feelings about In-N-Out.  It's good for fast food (assuming you think 15 min is fast) but it's not a real burger.  Too bad, because it's insanely convenient for me to eat there.",

Was very happy to find out there was one in the Tempe/Phoenix area when I was flying in for an event. And cracked a smile on the way to the hotel when I saw the neon sign from my Uber. It wasn't the most convenient drive from where I was staying. And my roommate - who had the car rental - wasn't stoked about having to drive us. And she definitely wasn't impressed with the drive-thru line. But once she tried it, she understood.   Went with my standard Double Double Animal Protein style. Hit the mark as expected. The fries didn't make it too long in the car - they were gone before we got back to the hotel. Thank goodness we didn't get animal fries; now that would have been interesting!  I can understand why some think we might be crazy for getting excited about fast food. But it's sort of like that scarcity principle - because I can't have it once a day, more like only once a year - I tend to get a little silly when it comes to getting my In-N-Out fix.",

Yes, it gets crowded, so if you're going to park and eat-in try parking in the lane closest to the restaurant, otherwise you'll get trapped by cars in the drive-thru line. Also, order your food and wait to get it before you grab a table. The system works that way. If you go and sit down while waiting for your food, then you've just taken a table away from someone who already has their food. Finally, at this location, if you're trying to get there from North of the 202, use Miller Road. It goes under the freeway and straight into the In-N-Out lot allowing you to skip the traffic on Rural.",

In order to find somewhere to sit, you have to be a bit savage and run, not walk, to the vacated table!   I always get an animal style double double (no bun, lettuce instead) and animal style fries. This time, I tried them well done. Wow! Super crispy and of course the secret sauce and cheese on top made them that much better!   This chain is always consistent and use fresh, quality ingredients. They have a large secret menu, which is a lot of fun! I'm dying to try their Neapolitan shake which is a mix of vanilla, strawberry and chocolate. Their strawberry shakes, which I have tried are super thick and creamy!  Check out their secret menu online and come prepared to try something different as their posted, in store menu is just a small preview of what you can get here!",

The pure fact that citizens out here have access to this burger from 10:30am to 1:30am any time in their lives is mind blowing to me.  That to me is like if I died, went to heaven and I was passing joints with Jesus while eating In and Out and not get fat, ever.  This burger is probably the epitome of all burgers you guys.  The satisfaction you get by eating this should make all your problems go away.  There is no other burger chain in this world that taste better than this.  And that is a fact.  My goal now is to figure out how I can relocate to the west coast to be closer to this life.  And if people ask me why I moved out here, my answer will be, to be closer to this burger.",

Yes, I was still a little full from my bagel this morning, but I only had to sit and wait 5-7 minutes...  Again, same menu items since 1948 (I think?) and relatively cheap. I like that they don't \"sell out\" and add on trending foods or even package their burgers/fries into combo's - they keep it all OG and it works for them.  Not a huge huge fan of their fries but I still jam them down my face. Friendly and fast service always, which is refreshing to me.  Only thing w/In-N-Out that is like a tiny insect crawling in my ear is the \"JOHN 3:16\" stamp on the bottom of their drink cups. Obviously, this is a religious verse but it just bugs me, you know? I'm not a Satanist who drinks goat's blood and bursts into flames on seeing any Christian references, but I just don't want it on my food products. I dunno - it's hard to explain I guess. I wonder if this ever poses issue within their employees who don't *happen* to be Christian?? I could honestly debate this all day... But just like the fries, it doesn't deter me from business and cramming down their burgers. :)",

You can read all over the place why In-N-Out is excellent, and I think you can believe the hype.  I went through the drive through on this visit and was met out there, despite the 40-something degree weather, by one of the employees who took my order in person. Did I mention that it was after midnight? Yup, they are open until 1am on weeknights.  My food was hot and tasted great -- I got a double cheeseburger \"animal style\" (extra veggies and grilled onions) with \"animal style\" fries on the side (fries with melted cheese, dressing, and grilled onions). After a long day spent in a variety of airports, this was a great \"welcome home\" and a worthy detour on my way home.",

I know In-N-Out is popular but I was blown away by how many people they can fit into this location. The parking lot was larger than average and full. This location is kind of a pain to get to with traffic as well. We went through the drive thru, where a woman was waiting with a clip board to take our order. We waited about seven minutes in drive thru before receiving our food which we took home to eat. As usual it hit the spot. I have not tried to shakes yet, but it is on my to do list.   *Tip: Order extra spread sauce on the side to dip your fries in.",

That's all I'm going to say. 5) Milkshakes are meh and super fatty. I usually get the strawberry lemonade.  I hope that helps.  And why three stars, you may ask? It's a regular old burger place, which makes it \"A-OK\" in my book. If In-N-Out offered a vegetarian burger and/or better fries, then they would be in the 4-5 star range. Alas, In-N-Out does not.",

I miss you already In-n-out.  Small request, and I don't mean to knit pick.  please learn how to make french fries.  I  know you do it naturally and such, but let's get it together guys..in 2013, a plate of fries that doesn't have a week's worth of salt in them shouldn't be considered a culinary breakthrough.

And patient too, as I struggled to recall the appropriate name for a couple of secret menu items.  THE FOOD: Burger is okay and the main reason for the 3 stars. Could use a bit more beef as you can barely taste it. Veggies are always crisp. The fries... I can skip the burger for the fries I'll tell you that much. Especially well done fries.  My kiddos love their milkshakes. Thick and creamy. Smell it and you know it's gonna be good.  A-OK. For the price, it's still a good deal.",

I was very impressed by the staff - every single person was smiling and hustling. I ordered a #2 and had my first root beer in about 10 years. I'm pretty sure my eyes rolled back in my head when I took my first bite of the burger. Despite not being a big fan of \"white buns\", I didn't even care because the burger was so delicious. Next time I will try animal style. I read a lot of comments about the fries being bland or boring. I think they tasted like fries without any added \"food-like products.\" I think many palates are so accustomed to overly seasoned and salted foods, they've forgotten what real food actually tastes like. The fries are made of potatoes and that's what they taste like. Boom. In-N-Out is my new guilty pleasure for a fast, reasonable and delicious burger.",

I would definitely suggest getting a black-white shake (on the hidden menu), just ask for it and they will give it to you. The black & white shake consists of a half chocolate milkshake and half vanilla milkshake mixed together. It is truly delicious, I enjoyed that as well as the fries which are cut in house before every day, fresh (which is very rare to have fresh things in this day and age). The burger was very good, and has a very good secret sauce (some similiar formula to thousand island) onthe burger which really makes all the other flavors pop out and taste delicious. The food there is near perfect for fast food, and also the staff is incredibly nice and helpful as well ad hard-working.

Truth be told, I've never thought of In-N-Out Burger as fast food.  It is True diner quality -- which is a compliment.  I'm talking about the diners of yesteryear.  When diner food was like home cooking, but with a much bigger grill!  I've been to a number of In-N-Out Burger's in my day.  Something I appreciate at each location is just how much the staff seems to enjoy their job.  Now, I don't have much fast food experience.  I don't know what it's like at one of the big chains, like McDonald's or Burger King -- but I've heard from friends who have worked at one of those places that it is a fairly thankless job.  I've never met a person, sans an owner of a McDonald's franchise, who said they loved to work for the golden arches.  But, people who work for In-N-Out Burger are always so...jovial.  It's actually quite jarring.    This location is no exception.  It opened at 1030AM.  We were there at 10AM because we were driving into town and figured it would be easier to wait than to drive back at a later time.  At 10AM, they were already helping customers and making orders.  Why? Because they had a line of people and cars that was there before we arrived at 10AM and they want to make their customers happy.  A simple philosophy that seems to be too often forgotten these days.  Of course, everyone seems to know about the secret menu, so I won't explain my order to anyone.  We got:  Double Double  Animal Style - it was exactly what we hoped it would be.  Flavorful, juicy, well-cooked and delicious!  These burgers really stand the test of time, as well, due to a wonderfully sweet and decently dense bun.  Fries Well-Done Animal Style - These fries are a gift from whatever god you believe in. Secret sauce, grilled onions, cheese and deliciously crisp fries make for a mouth-watering experience.  All in all, a great location that went above and beyond to take care of its customers.    As an aside, for us, 1030AM equated to 1230PM since we live in Texas and had just driven into town.  Watching all these college kids eat burgers and fries for breakfast -- well, I wept for my love of pancakes and bacon.  Another aside, most In-N-Out Burger locations still don't know the \"On the Sal\" secret menu item.  It's a side salad with secret sauce (a bit like thousand island but better).  So, order it whenever possible!  :D",

    "text": "I'm from the east coast, and recently moved to the area.  So I bought into all the hype and the good ratings on Yelp and tried In And Out.  Boy, was I thoroughly disappointed.  I checked out their website before I went and knew what was on their regular menu and their \"not so secret\" menu.   I was ready to order as we pulled up during the dinner hour to a very full drive thru.  It took 10 mins from the time we ordered to the time we got our food.  I was prepared for this and wasn't really an issue for me.    So I get home and unpack my food and get ready to eat.  The fries are very cold, bland and had a lot of burnt fries in the mix.  I just smothered them in ketchup and had them anyway.  Nothing special there.  Now for the burger.  I have never in my life eaten a burger with more than one patty (except for a Big Mac) just because I never need/want that much ground beef on my sandwich.  Well I could have gone 4x4 on this one because these beef patties were the thinnest I have EVER seen from a fast food joint.  They were black, charred, and leather looking on the outside, yet somehow despite the microscopic thinness of the patty were still pink on the inside.  Yuck.  Overall this meal was pretty disgusting and certainly did not live up to its reputation.  I seriously doubt I will ever visit an In and Out chain again.",

I should have just stayed away.  I had to wait in the drive through for about 15 minutes and my double burger was tiny, cold and raw in the middle.  Not pink or slightly under cooked but raw with an odd char on the outside.  The fries were half burnt and reminded me of \"Potato Sticks\" from when I was a kid, but not nearly as good.  I let my dog have some of it because it was so gross and it made him sick for 2 days.  I'll just stick with \"Whataburger\" or even McDonald's. I have no idea why this place would ever get a 5 Star review.",

The drive-thru line can be long a lot of the times, and for good reason.  Of course, the thing that differentiates their long drive-thru lines is that they actually move rather quickly so I never mind waiting for all that grilled goodness.  The only thing that could make their burgers better is bacon but that's like saying the only thing that can make something wet is water.  Bacon or not, everyone should pay homage to In-N-Out burger =)",

As I stepped up to the counter, I gazed upwards at the sign for the pricing and was impressed by the simplicity and reasonable nature of their pricing.I decided on purchasing a simple \"double-double\", along with a vanilla shake and a side of animal fries. The animal fries themselves were not on the menu! In-N-Out is one of the few restaurants that offers a \"secret menu\", where customers can purchase items that are not listed in store. The animal fries were among the best fries that I've ever tasted, and the burger was the best that I've ever had from a fast food joint! All in all, if you're craving a burger, head on over to In-N-Out!",

In 04 I moved east and every time I'm near an InO, I have to stop!    I got off the plane yesterday and asked the rental car lady how to get to the closest one.  I'd been once before but couldn't remember the directions.  My partner and I jumped in the car and zoomed over.  We were on a mission.  As soon as I walked in and smelled the burger grease, I knew I was home.  I showed some restraint in only ordering the cheeseburger combo (I normally get the double double).  I inhaled my food and left.    I'm plotting as to which day I'll be returning this week--and I will get that double double.    YUM!",

Ok, sure, they are fresh, but they have no flavor and taste like cardboard. Its cheap, so thats always a plus. They are always super busy and I get it. But I can't agree with the 5-star reviews. If there was a 3.5 review, thats what I'd give. I'm in between a 3 and 4.   If you want a GREAT hamburger and support a local restaurant, ran by local owners, head down to university drive in tempe and get an amazing burger at The Chuckbox.  If you stick with a chain? I think Fatburger has these guys beat.",

Ten long years of torture, unsatisfied cravings and crappy burgers. So it is without shame that I admit that a huge deciding factor in my move to Arizona was the presence of In-N-Out burger.  There's no dollar menu, only 3 combo meals and except for the price, the menu is essentially the same as it was 50 years ago. Yet In-N-Out is ingenious in its simplicity. You always know what to expect: fresh meat, never frozen; fresh cut french fries; fresh lettuce and tomatoes; and real American cheese.   I live just up the street from the Rural and 202 location. Like every other In-N-Out I have visited in the area, the store is clean and the staff are all friendly and each possesses many more brain cells than your average McDonald's or Burger King employee.   If you've never been, or rarely get to go, then you definitely want to go with the Double Double, fries and a shake. If you get to go there more frequently then you might want to scale back to a regular cheeseburger unless you have a really fast metabolism. Also, Google \"In-N-Out secret menu\" for a complete list of all the secret menu items such as animal style burgers and fries, 4X4's and the like. I definitely recommend the animal style fries...so tastey.",
