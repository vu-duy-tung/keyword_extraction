    "text": "We decided to go have our Easter dinner at the cheesecake factory tonight and I wish we wouldn't have.  Right away our server messed up the appetizer order, ok it happens, not too big of a deal. But it got messed up a second time. Then when our dinner was brought out the server never came back till everyone was almost done. My dinner was not good and I wanted to get something else. But I had to sit while my family are waiting for our server to come back. When she finally did, she questioned me on why I didn't like my food and if I had ever had it before....I had actually had it many times and was one of my favorite things. She became very rude after all that. Didn't bother apologizing. I had to wait another 15/20 min after everyone was done eating and paid for my meal to come out. The one thing that made this experience has was the rudeness of our server Alexandria T. I'm a server and I think one of the most important thing is to check back with your table to make sure everyone is happy. This could've been different if she had done that. At my restaurant when there's a problem, a manager always comes to the table....no manager bothered to talk to us. Very disappointing",

It used to be that I would typically get the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake, which by the way, is sinful. Well, I guess they all are. It has an Oreo crust, chocolate chips throughout and on the top, and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. Then they introduced the Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake and I'm like, seriously, Cheesecake Factory? It has a moist, red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake. It also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting. I came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token (as my husband puts it, yeah right!). I got the Cookie Dough slice and then I noticed the Red Velvet which I thought was just a limited time. So what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices. $16 later (yikes!) but I am the happiest girl in the world.",

The bread that they brought out was I think dipped in a whole vat of butter, the complementary bread they brought out was actually better with the dip. For the main dish i got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and it was awesome. The flavor and the crispy topping brought everything together. The veggies and the chicken were plentiful and covered in the sauce. I brought it home because i couldn't finish it all and it was just as good reheated. The wait staff was very polite and knowledgeable.",

We chose not to eat the cheesecake (this time), but it has always been amazing in the past. Our waiter was nice, but definitely a cheeseball.

Anyway, this past weekend, I took my hubby there to celebrate his bday and come to find out he has NEVER eaten at a CF anywhere.  I almost fell when he spat out those words.  \"It's a rite of passage,\" I find myself squealing out.  Well, he loved it even though he couldn't get over at how small the filet mignon looked on the plate.  However, it was my friend who ordered the Jamaican dish with shrimp that had the best meal at the table.  I had a bite from her plate and my taste buds went into a convulsion, it was stupendous.  I had the salmon special.  It was good but nondescript.  The Kentucky tea and the cherry cheesecake were real smooth and good for my taste palette.  You can't go wrong when you choose CF.  I'm so glad that hubby's eyes and taste buds have opened up to the CF way of eating.",

When we got there,it was extremely crowded,we gave them our name and they said 10 minutes tops.Well 40 minutes later we were finally seated.The waitress was nice but stuffed us in to a very small booth.She was slow bringing our drinks and our apps,and only refilled our drinks once.            All of this could have been forgiven if the food was good.My husband and friend Tim ordered the steak both medium rare,what they got was a piece of meat smaller than the palm of my hand fully cooked.I ordered the Philly Cheese sandwhich,it had no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave.Ive bought better at Wal-Mart.I ordered two kids chicken finger dinners for my boys but they only brought out 1 and when I told the waitress,she insisted that I only said one and that maybe the boys should share because the kitchen was really busy.

    "text": "This review is going to sound a bit harsh.... but I'm sorry, for the prices they are charging, I expect a little more class.   Yes, the food was good, the waitress was nice and funny, but they both needed a bit of refining.   To start off with the first thing out of the waitress' mouth was \"I love your hair!\" Then continued on about hair for anorther minute and a half, ending with when hers is wet it's \"like almost touching my butt.\" OKay! Over-share honey! I'm supposed to order food and a drink now that we have discussed your butt? Anyway, finally moving on I ordered a tea and my friend got a water. Her timing for check backs were great, but refilled my tea waaaaaay too much, I would take two sips and then there she was again refilling my glass (and filling the air with unnecessary commentary), not to mention when she refilled my glass she had to pick it up every time and twice she touched the times on my forks. I know it sounds weird, but really bothered me. Another one of my big pet peeves, if you are wanting to remove a plate from the table and I have a utensil still on it, ask me to grab it off or just bring me a new one. DO NOT remove it yourself and place on the table, ick! She also grabbed my butter wrapper off my plate touching my bread. Just leave me a lone lady, stop touching all my s***! I felt like she wanted to pop a squat with us and have girl talk. Back off.   The food came, it was alright. I started with a side salad and friend for fried artichoke hearts. My salad clearly had been pre made and sitting in a cooler for hours, as the lettuce was brown and over dressed. The artichokes were good and the dipping sauce it came with was yummy. Everything else that hit the table was great. PS: Vanilla bean cheese cake is awesome!   Over all we had a good time. But for my meal costing me $30 and I didn't even have a cocktail, home girl needs to learn some cooth and manners serving a table.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas. I live across from Cheesecake Factory on Camelback Rd. I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) \"I thought that you forgot about me?\" His curt reply was \"It's gotta cook!\"....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito. I am discovering that there are many other options in close proximity to me.....You NEVER know who your customers are! I've been in the restaurant business for over 30 years in New York, Paris and Las Vegas and have moved to PHX, to live and open a restaurant here....Oh, yeah, and I happen to be one of the Top Chefs in America:-)  Herb",

I ended up with a chicken sandwiche and soup... none of which was earth shattering... but I loved the waiter... we had fun with the fact that the seemingly 'we never get out much' peeps next to us didnt know how to act in a restaurant...and he brought us a piece of decadent red velvet cheese cake and even wrote in cursive a cute little note for me and my friend.. and I will leave it at that:-) Score for the factory.. compliments of the waiter...

I've been to this location and to the Cheesecake Factory in NoSco a number of times over the years, but a fresh visit at lunch today gives me a reason to review Cheesecake Factory. We've all been there, right? The food is pretty good, they have a big, giant, varied and eclectic menu (thank you messieurs Roget). You get a metric ton of food for the price (I brought approx. 2/3 of my club sandwich home with me and my puppy couldn't be happier, plus, I couldn't begin to eat all the fries). No room for cheesecake on this visit or I would tossing and turning at my desk all afternoon. I don't think the food is really the point with Cheesecake Factory. The lunch was nice, the food tasted good, and the atmosphere was really very pleasant. The service was good, prompt, attentive and friendly. There just isn't anything that stands out about Cheesecake factory to make me want to give them more than an average rating. They do lots of things pretty well, but if I wanted great fried chicken, I'd go to Lolo's...if I wanted a great steak, I'd run up to the Fairmont...you get the idea. So, pretty good, esp. for a chain, with good service and good price points and more food than you haul in wheelbarrow!",

I am not a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory, it's not that it's bad - I just prefer to try restaurants that are not necessarily chain style restaurants - especially when it comes to dinner style dates. However, my friends picked the spot and I obliged. I ordered a lemon drop martini and a cucumber mule for cocktails. For dinner, I ordered the alfredo but asked them to add blackened shrimp for some added flavor. The shrimp were on the smaller end and were slightly over cooked. The taste of the rich, creamy alfredo made up for it but it set pretty heavy in the belly. So much so, that I ended up passing on cheesecake. I think I would order off the small plate menu next time and leave room for all the yummy desserts. I had a pretty busy day so I was starving when the food came out - sorry, no pics of the food - just part of the menu.",

When we walked in we asked for a table outside and then after waiting for 20 min they sat us inside, after reminding her we wanted outside we were told it would be another 25 min because she forgot.  Our waitress was useless, she messed up more things about our order than I could have ever imagined, and dropped two of our dishes upon bringing them to our table (This caused us to wait even longer due to remaking of our food.).  After always needing to ask for more water and asking three times for mayo, saying she was awful is an understatement.    The only reason this place is getting three stars is because when you finally get the food it's always pretty good with nice serving sizes.  All in all, I won't be in a hurry to come back anytime soon.    Return factor 15%",

    "text": "It's like any other Cheesecake Factory out there, though with all the common problems I have with TCF this one stood out because of our great server, Brittaney.  The bread served was good, I'm always a fan of sourdough but they were hardly warm.  For apps, I had the Tuna Tartare which was good, strong in flavor but the portion was way too small for something to cost $7. It came with barely enough fried off wontons to eat with the tartare.  I split the Louisiana Chicken pasta and even so the portion was filling. Good pasta with a kick to eat, creamy sauce and perfectly fried chicken.   For dessert I went with something light, so I decided on the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It was a bit too warm for my liking as I like my cheesecakes cold. The flavor was light and not too sweet though.  Our server Brittaney was so nice and gave great suggestions! A great waitstaff here overall. I suppose it's just the food here that can be a hit or miss and the price point is way more than what it should be.",

The last two trips here have always been a nightmare NOT with the wait staff but the host and or hostesses   They stuck us back in the east side if the seating are with all sorts if open tables. Ince back there there was twi very large parties that were so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. We excused ourselves from the wait staff to be seated in another area. She said it would be 5 minutes. After watching several couples and groups get seated right away  and 27 minutes later without a word from the hostess we left Wont be back to this location   Better to read the reviews and believe them!! !",

Right when we walked in the receptionist made eye contact with us then just ignore us so we had to walk toward her and say \"Hi\" first which is unacceptable. Second, she told us to wait a couple minutes to be seated while there was no waiting list. So she watched us walked out and walked back in and then she responded \" oh i thought you guys left\". She was just terrible at what she does. Also, i ordered a chicken burrito with guacamole and without cilantros and of course they made it with cilantros on it. It couldn't of got any worse but then they bring my burrito with no guacamole. I addressed it and she said they ran out of guacamole. At that time i was almost halfway through my burrito. It would have been nice to know there was no guacamole before they brought out my burrito for the second time.",

Bad service, took forever. I wasted so much gas waiting in the takeout parking spot.  The shrimp roll.... Had ONE HALF of a shrimp in each roll..... I guess that's the portion for real... The sauces that come with it are garbage, inedible.  The noodles in it are gross. Overall a bad choice.  So disappointing.   Crab artichoke dip tastes like canned TUNA and rotten. I felt like throwing up after I ate it. Plus they gave me four tiny slices of bread for a huge portion of fishy nasty dip. Just pretend you mixed cream cheese with cat food and warmed it up... There you go.  Edemame, freaking soggy and salty...  Potstickers..... Tasted like canned chicken... Sauce was super strong and nasty. Looked frozen and microwaved.  $55 FOR THIS   FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS..............:::::  FIFTY.       FIVE.    DOLLLARS.        WHAT THE HELL.  I am without words.  I have been to a cheese cake factory before in CA. It was edible atleast...  This one was a JOKE.   One word.   DISGUSTING.   We're still hungry and threw it all out. Had to go get a burger some where else. The stand $6 for a burger... What a relief.  $6   SIX DOLLARS   SIX.   DOLLARS.    Cheese cake factory.... How are you in business ??? And how do you live with yourself feeding people all of this nasty food... I wonder how many people have been sick and disappointed from eating here...  Stay away. Go to the stand or honestly Taco Bell, McDonalds... Anywhere else... Yuck id rather eat pink slime from McDonald's than cheese cake factory ever again...  I am in complete shock that this nasty food is being served and people come here...   If I wanted to eat rotten tuna artichoke dip I could have made that myself and it probably would have tasted better than cheese cake factory..  You call yourself chefs...  Hahah.   Awful.",

The service was good as was the food. Thr waitress suggested eggplant Parmesan which was good and to be honest I've never seen it on the 15 page menu that they have. We enjoyed one slice of shared red velvet cheesecake which was delicious as well as take-home cheesecakes which were equally as good. The Asian lettuce wrap tacos are always a good lite choice and if you're here on the day when they have the chicken artichoke soup I would highly suggest getting a cup.  It is one of the most delicious soups I've ever had!",

Since my husband and I were picking up the  tab come to find out from our guests only when outside and saying our goodbyes that it was mentioned by several people. My dish of Skinny Chicken Pasta was cold and I had to look for my chicken but decided not to say anything.  Our bill was $360.00 and not objecting  to that but the kicker was that my husband was celebrating his Birthday and his cheesecake was supposed to be complimentary. It came with good wishes on it and some of the staff sang as well. After reviewing the bill this morning they had charged us for the Cheesecake .  Kind of puts us off for doing our next celebration  at the Cheesecake Factory.",

I also ordered the chicken rigatoni pasta in red sauce with basil.  Nothing too amazing, I could definitely cook something just as delicious at home.

Love the food, the portions, vast selections of appys', entrees and desserts. Hate the wait and lack of reservations.  The Biltmore Hotel called in a reservation for us for a table of 8 for 6:30pm on Sunday.  It wasn't a reservation, nor a pseudo reservation, we ended up being seated at 6:50 pm.  If you don't get there (any of the restaurants early, before 5pm, expect a wait.)  I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps, $15, extremely yummy and enough to share with 5 others and chicken and biscuits, $21, enough for 3 meals.  The biscuits are airy like Marie Callenders corn bread, I got 3 chicken breasts and plenty of gravy.  Friends ordered the Steak Diane, excellent mushrooms, miso salmon, shepards pie, just to name a few.  Everything was so good.  The downside of our experience at this restaurant was the ordeal of no reservation and our waiter was inattentive, we had to ask for our drinks and appy's.  Had to ask the manager to find out what was going on with our waitstaff and order.  Hopefully, this was not the norm at this location.",

When it was served I began to eat it and noticed there was no chicken.  I politely asked if I had ordered wrong and she said \"no\" the chicken might be on the bottom. I checked, no chicken. I again brought it to her attention and she said she had to show the kitchen to be sure that I was correct.  She then proceeds to take my salad that I had been tossing around to the kitchen .  They  go through it and she brings the same salad back saying \"yea, you were right they forgot it, they laughed and added some for you\". I would have thought they would have made a new one not played with mine and add chicken to fix it.  I chose not to eat it after others have handled it. I didn't want take it further  because I was with others.  But.... Cheesecake, I was embarrassed enough for us all. Worst service ever!  And an attitude I was shocked by!  I  sure the other people I was with will not return there anytime soon. There are a lot of great places to go at the Biltmore and Cheesecake if no longer one of our choices.",

    "text": "Just some preface, I gave this location a 5 star mainly based on comparison with it's counterparts in California.  I love Cheesecake factory. I like their appetizers, their pastas, their entre's. In California, I've been to the one in San Jose, Irvine, and San Diego. The food is always about the same (good), the line always long (hour), and the service is always mediocre ( too busy to be attentive, professional enough not to make it an issue).  This location was nothing like this in a good way ( maybe cuz it's not CA?)  1. The food was excellent. My party had:  - Pasta Da Vinci - Great  - Wings - Good  - Tuna Tartar Appetizer small plate - good  2. Service was amazing. My drink never even got halfway down, every few minutes someone checked up on us, wow....  3. No wait. None. Walked right in... I don't think I've ever seen that happen...  Amazing. I know how I say I hate reviewing franchises, but wow, good food, no wait, great service....",

I had about the simplest thing on the menu--the Regina Special, with soup (good), salad (okay), and a mayonnaise sandwich, aka chicken salad with almonds. In this case, the chicken should have been in teeny tiny letters and the almonds must have been disguised as mayonnaise, and a very good disguise it was. Yuk! No crunch, no color, no like.

    "text": "$7 per slice for a Cheesecake? Okay that's understandable for being at the most expensive commercial real estate on 24st & Camelback in Phoenix.   What is not excusable is the Moroccan Chicken. The only reason I got in my car a blew $30 on a meal on take out, is because of a video showing how delicious it was. What I got from this location was nothing short of horrible. It looked nothing like what I saw in the video, and on top of that the chicken was so dry I had to chase it down with water just to swallow it. It did not matter that they were generous, giving 3 breasts with the meal, because I could not finish even one. Since I hate wasting food I gave it to my 3 cats, but they would not even eat it, and they love chicken!  I would not have even written this review because I hate bashing businesses, but this place refused to answer my email complaint about the bad meal. At least answer and acknowledge you read it. Next time I'll just go down the road to Chili's. At least they try..",

I sent it back and it came out very quickly, the kitchen added lemon and capers to the Alfredo.  WRONG!  Again it went back and this time I got a reasonable facsimile of a piccata.  The next time I went in the bartender Chelsea ignored me for almost 20 minutes.  When she finally did come over she was rude and treated me like a second class subhuman piece of trash.  Today I went back and Chelsea was working again.  I had just returned from a hiking trip with friends and sat in the back of a Jeep for six hours.  I just wanted to have a drink and relax while I waited for an Uber to pick me up.  Unfortunately Chelsea's girlfriend was sitting at the bar and didn't shut up from the moment I walked in to the moment I left.  I'm not saying it's wrong to have friends come in when your working and everyone has the right to express themselves but there is a limit and boundaries need to be set.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory, you had your three strikes!",

And it was AWESOME! Great service, delicious food, yummy drinks...they were 100% on point.  I wonder if perhaps I have just been choosing the wrong entrees all along, or if something has changed with them, but whatever the case, last night was awesome.   At our table, we had two stand-out dishes, the chicken madeira with steak diane, and the caramel chicken something or other. The other two dishes were good, but nothing spectacular, and this is a review about what made me happy, so pbbbbbbbbbt!  So much so, that we ordered a couple of cheesecakes to go. The lemon raspberry cheesecake, by the way, is phenomenal...raspberry lady fingers, lemon cheesecake, fresh-ish whipped cream...yum yum! I'll have to wait to get feedback regarding the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake though.  So, that being said, I will no longer sully your name with negative comments or nay-saying...and I will be back. Thank you for a great evening.",

This location is nestled between plenty of office buildings and if you go right at noon, there will surely be a wait.   Today I got the same great food and service! After glancing at the novel-sized menu and wrestling in my mind what to have... I had my usual: the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. I always order mine without the middle slice of bread. There are few reasons why I do this: 1. I can't fit the double decker sandwich in my mouth 2. it makes the sandwich more packed full of shrimp and bacon! 3. Less calories - which I guess makes up for the bacon and fries I had! All in all the sandwich was delish! They have a new nifty metal fry holder that kept my fries hot, too!",

Came here with my husband and had the worst experience ever. Our server ignored us and was rude the entire time ! It was so bad I decided to contact them through their website and spoke to the manager at the store who sent us a gift card to give them another try. Decided to try them again, I got to go food today, two plates and a side was 44$!!!! We got the food, went home and noticed my side was missing! It's not a big deal to me, I know people make mistakes and things happen. We called right away to let them know and the manager told us the side would be taken off our tab. I ordered a teriyaki chicken with rice and I only ate my rice because the chicken just felt so slimy and gross. It didn't taste like it had been grilled at all. Almost like they got a piece of rotisserie chicken and put sauce on the top. The skin wasn't cooked all the way through and it was just wet and gross. My husband ordered Alfredo pasta which he thought was okay. It sucks giving a review this low because the hostesses are so nice and welcoming and managers are amazing! I really hope they are able to work out all their kinks and hopefully redeem themselves to me for me to go back.",

    "text": "I was there two nights in a row with big groups while I was at a volleyball tournament for my daughter's team.  First of all, I really appreciated how servers offered to split the checks rather than us, the customers, having to ask.  The first night, I had the pasta napoletano which I would translate to a meat lover's pasta.  It was delicious and I never would've thought I'd ever eat pepperoni with pasta before.  I also had a drink called an Irish Manhattan because I was craving alcohol and coffee at the same time.  Let me say that there was plenty of alcohol, but not a lot of coffee to it unless you count the three coffee beans that sat in my martini glass.  It was nice, but not necessarily what I was looking for.  I had my regular raspberry white chocolate cheesecake.   The next night I went \"light\" with the egg roll sampler and the pork belly sliders.  I could not finish my food as it was plentiful.  The pork belly sliders had more of a pulled pork texture to it, so it kind of tricked my mind into thinking I was eating something else.  My daughter had the \"meat lovers\" pasta upon my recommendation and she loved it too.  Like father, like daughter I guess.  BTW, she hates pepperoni, but she gladly ate everything on her plate.  I ordered the banana creme cheesecake to go, while she ordered the Oreo Cookie Dream cheesecake.  Mine was okay, as I needed a stronger banana taste to satisfy my cravings.  My daughter thought her cheesecake was way too rich and so she barely touched hers when she tried it later.  All in all, you can't go wrong with this place.  Both nights the wait staff was kind, courteous, and patient with my large group.  I can imagine that large groups can be a nightmare for food servers, but they have this down pat.",

    "text": "03-20-2019 Yelp review  Amal Al. Cheesecake Factory.  I like cheesecake factory restaurants, and it is one of my favorite dining. I love most of their dishes, the feature they have is having varied menu. It is a place where most people can find their favorite food. Also, if you have children, you will not suffer to find tasty and healthy food for them. They have American, Italian, Asian, and global dishes which let you vary your table, and if you are confused which restaurant you want, cheesecake factory is a good choice that gives you many options. Their tasty dishes are a lot, but I love their pastas. It is well flavored and with balanced sauce. I like chipotle pasta and it is spicy if you like spicy and chicken pasta, I recommend it. Cajun Jambalaya is very good as well. It comes with shrimp and chicken, and it cooked with pepper, onion and tomato sauce. It is supper yummy. I like Their popular appetizer cheese macaroni balls, and I cannot go there with no order it, and I tried their lemon grilled salmon. It is so good.  However, some of dishes are not delicious at all because they use some strong flavors on it. Especially if they make Asian food. It seems not real Asian food, they overdo it. One time, I ordered fried orang chicken with white rice and it is Asian dish, I couldn't eat it. It was very sweet and with unnecessary added sauce. Also, my husband ordered Thai chicken dish, and it was over sweet too, so we could not taste the chicken.  The prices are expensive, and how expensive? that depends on your order. It is like most of dining restaurants that have two dollars in yelp. If you order expensive food like steak, salmon or so on, it is going to be more expensive. The good thing is their plate is big and you can share it with others, so you and who you are share with, will not need to order more than main plates and that make the total not that expensive. Furthermore, I like going there with my friends, and we enjoy their food. It is recommended place if you have your family or your friends with you.    The service is good until it become very crowded. The thing that I like is they are friendly and helpful if you have kids and that what I like most in the restaurant. They care about your table to be suitable if you have stroller, and they are in general fast and helpful. However, I said before if it crowded, they become very slow and with untrained service. One time, I waited my order for more than 30 minutes, and they brought the appetizer after the main plate, and they gave us the wrong check, so I didn't give the waiter tip because I wasn't satisfied about the service, and it was horrible service. But that didn't happen to me always, it was few times only. In general, their service is good enough.",

The menu is extensive so there's something for everyone, however, since they don't exactly have a specialty, all the entrees come across as bland. My sliders we soggy and several of the other appetizers we tried were average at best.  Big surprise - the cheesecake is good.   Pro tip: Grab dinner at one of the other restaurants in the Biltmore area and reserve The Cheesecake Factory for dessert.",

I've been in the biz in the past and go out of my way to be friendly as well as a solid 20 to 25 percent tipper.   I won't go into all the details,but took 30 min to get my burger. Afterwards asked for mustard. That took another 10 minutes.  Sitting at the bar I mentioned to the bartender that it seemed a long time to wait.. he got angry with me and started accusing my of treating him like a servant.  Which in fact employees of a restaurant are servants by definition.. It was so disturbing I paid, left no tip and more than half my food. The manager was at the hostess station and I informed him of the treatment from the bartender. He seem not concerned.. I will never step foot in the restaurant again and will share my experience with many... Bad bartender bad management...",

    "text": "Well, we were all very hungry and we picked Cheesecake factory as it was 1 pm and the crowd was mostly gone.    We got seated promptly, however, our waitress seemed like she was rushing at every pass.  Ordering our drinks, our food, it was like sit down and tell her immediately what we want.  There was no warmth there at any level.  Very poor service.  We felt very uncomfortable.  Needless to say, we ordered our salads and we ordered Ranch and got Vinagarette!  How does that happen?  RUSHING!!!!  We had to get them replaced twice.  We ordered our entree's along with an appetizer.  So, I don't know what the Brea Ca location is doing right, but the other locations need to follow it.  The QA at this facility was atrocious. We tried the Fried zucchini once again and once again, let down.  There was zero, zip, nada flavor at all.  In Brea, they had awesome seasoning and were cooked perfectly.  Here it was dumped and served.  Just terrible.   I ordered the Eggplant Parmasean for my Entree.  We waited about 20 minutes only for the waitress to come back and say they were out.  How can you be out of Eggplant at lunch at 1 pm???  Again, lack of rigor and discipline in the kitchen as you should never run out of anything especially a top seller.  So I had to find something else and ordered the Truffle Honey Chicken.  What a disappointment.  Two small pieces of this so called chicken were as hard as a rock.  You had a very hard time cutting it with the sharpest knife and it was un-edible as it was too hard to chew.  It was like eating rocks.  The Gumbo was ok, but slopped in the bowl and lacked any presentation as well as the orange chicken.  We tried to end on a good note with a piece of their new Celebration Cheesecake.  Well, unless you like Icing and I mean a lot of icing this is for you.  However, if you like a cake along with your icing this is not for you.  This was layer and layer of icing on a very, very small sliver of cake.  What a waste.  This one needs to be shelved.  Needless to say, Cheesecake Factory lacks QA across the board and the food gets wasted as it cannot be eaten.  Very frustrated on this visit.",

The Cuban sandwich tasted OK, however I would just call it a simple ham and cheese sandwich. And honestly why would I want to pay 15 dollars for that? Their signature  brown bread was delicious and our server Sydney saved the day with her professionalism and efficiency. Actually she earned all the stars. And no, we won't go back.",

Also had Ahi Capaccio and that was delicious, but a bit overpriced for the amount.  The strawberry shortcake was not to my liking. The replacement for the soft, moist shortcake cake was this hard crusty, and ultimately soggy crust like pieces. I did not like it one bit.

The skinnylicious offerings are quite good too - sometimes I wonder how they actually lower the calories in these meals (smaller portions and probably higher salt content).  We have gone to this location at least a dozen times over the past year. In almost all cases, the service has been excellent. Friendly and attentive. All you would expect.  In terms of parking, it's generally easy in the \"token\" lot right in front of the restaurant (2 hours free). If you are going at a busy time, there is additional free parking at the back of the shopping center only a few minutes walk away. There is also valet parking.  In terms of the wait, you might experience one depending on when you go. It's a popular place. We try to go just before the busy hours (e.g. 11:45 on a weekend) so we haven't waited more than ten minutes. However, when we leave around 1pm, I can see that there is probably a 15-20 minute wait.  Good place for lunch or dinner. We'll keep going back.",

But unfortunately, we ended up not having much fun at all.  On a Tuesday night, we arrived at 7pm and after only 10 min., were seated at a booth, which we had requested. But the booth was so dimly lit that I could't read my menu! Literally... So after a couple of minutes I asked the waitress if we could change seats and she said if I wanted to do that I would have to get up and ask the hostess myself... to which I replied no. I do not have to get up- I have a waitress who can ask her on my behalf. She rolled her eyes and suggested that if I could;t see I should use my iPhone instead... really? How rude, I thought. Why can;t she just help me instead of trying to be sarcastic?  Then the manager comes over and asks me if I would prefer a seat in the middle of the room- with hard chairs. I told him no because our family had just spent 4 hrs on bleachers at the baseball game, so I needed a more comfortable seat. (Not to mention the fact that we specifically asked for a booth from the begging and there are other booths with lights) So he told me that there was no other table. That was simply not True, as there were other tables which had light. There was no sense talking to them. The noise level was really high so I felt like they could't really hear me- or else were;t trying. I was wanting them to help me, but they were too busy to care. They basically said take it or leave it.  I ended up using my iPhone and letting the kids eat... I drank water since I had lost my appetite. It's hard to want to to eat drink and be merry when you are treated like you don;t belong. I did;t bother getting drinks, or dessert, since I just wanted to leave asap.  I also tried not to be upset with the fact that the waitress barely came to our table and we had to flag her down for napkins, forks, water, ranch, bread... It was exhausting. We left disappointed. I reluctantly left a tip even though I felt like writing her a note on how to treat your fellow man. But I decided that nothing I would say could change their rude, insensitive demeanor. After all, it was such a small request and they made such a big deal out of it. Apparently business is so good that they don't have to treat customers with respect.   After that experience, I doubt I'll be back anytime soon... but that's OK... I doubt they'll miss me...",

Anyways when we walked in the hostesses told us it would be about 15 minutes for a table and we ended up waiting 50 minutes!!! After we sat, we weren't greeted by a server for about 15 more minutes... I ended up going to the front to order food to go because we waited an hour and a half and still the waiter didn't take our order. Management was not helpful at all.. Horrible horrible experience",

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory is such a mixed bag of good and bad. There's almost always a wait if you have a party larger than 2, even if the restaurant is empty. I don't know if they are understaffed or if there are tons many people visiting on a daily basis. Either way, call ahead if possible.  This particular location has a valet, but you can easily park around the mall and walk a couple minutes if you want to save a few bucks. Servers are friendly and attentive. Restaurant is nice, big, clean - kind of reminds me of a Vegas casino.  I really like the rye bread - it's soft and sweet. White bean hummus is a nice twist on classic hummus, although I think the accompanying bread was a bit stale. No biggie. I just wish I had ordered a different entree. I got the Chinese chicken salad, which is a stupid choice given their huge menu of American and European dishes. The salad tasted like the Asian chicken salad from Wendy's, but with a bunch of rice noodles on top. Sure, it's a big salad, but not worth the $14.50 I paid for it. Like I said, my own fault - order at your own risk!  The crispy chicken costoletta was actually good. Once again, big portion, and the chicken was really nice. Mashed potatoes seemed a bit tired, and the asparagus was nothing fancy. Still, it was good, and I wouldn't mind ordering it in the future.  I think the food here is good, not outstanding, and I do think it's overpriced. I wouldn't mind eating here again but it'll be awhile before I do.",

My most recent meal (\"Evelyn's Favorite Pasta\") was a bad choice, the pasta was undercooked and the combination was bland, I desperately wanted some tomato sauce or something. But it's Cheesecake Factory, the special favorite of many. Overall all the food is generally good, as is, of course, the cheesecake. Don't come without buying cheesecake, even if you don't have room for it; take a slice home with you. But to my original surprise the first time I came to one of these, Cheesecake Factory is about a dining experience with a very full menu of fine meals.",

Best service.   Over the holidays I received a $25 gift certificate and used it (!) I was just bowled-over at how great the food and service was. In case it matters: Steak Diane and a big fat Scotch whiskey. Steak was delicious and the \"real\" portion was generous. (scotch whiskey delicious, as always, McCallan in case you wanted to know. ). I know their reputation is for huge portions, but this steak was under $20, delicious and plenty of it.   (My only suggestion is that the mashed potatoes were not creamy enough. They were good but they were not creamy enough. )  IMPRESSIVE!!!   4 STARS!!  The tab was reasonable, John at the bar was terrific!    I never thought I'd say this but I'm going back and I'm probably going back a couple times.",

    "text": "I love the Cheesecake Factory, and cannot say enough good things about them!  I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time.  Their menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.    Today I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me!  I will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.    I will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of \"15 minute to go\" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's \"free\" parking but they shove you way in the back on the \"north\" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall.  My advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts...  Anyways, I love you cheesecake factory and you have never failed me! MUAH!",

Before my party was seated we were discussing the delicious choices of cheesecake over by the displays and noticed a dead fly on one of the cheesecakes. We informed a staff member. The fly was removed and the cheesecake was placed back on the rack to sell! I'm sure it's inevitable sometimes, but I think we were just in shock that the fly was simply picked out so nonchalantly. Needless to say when asked if we wanted to try one of their cheesecakes after our dinner we kindly declined.",

Having good company and a good appetite makes a perfect lunch.  The choices on the menu makes it so very hard to decide.  I also have a couple of friends that tell me you can not go wrong with anything on this menu. I would love to come back again maybe on a special occasion because it is special occasion kind of money you will spend. You do get complimentary bread and that is a plus because its not bad at all. I like the wheat one it seemed to be softer than the white.  I did not get the cheesecake maybe next visit.",

The Skinny:   A couple of things...the menu got skinnier, to say the least there new menu is fantastic and I like the fact that they didn't destroy an entire rainforest to make it...the old ones I think use to have perfume sample cards come out. and magazine subscription cards...sometimes I would fall asleep just reading thru it...  I like the fact that the new menu has the old favorites but also some healthier options. The Skinny shrimp summer rolls...the skinny shrimp taco's and the skinny grilled salmon and at pretty affordable prices!!!

    "text": "Normally I never visit chains as I detest them, but on a Sunday night Mother's Day, there really was nowhere else to go. It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away.  The waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight.   Pretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++  I got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal.  Summary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner. I'm going to have to pass on this one unless I need cheesecake in the near future. The validated parking is free with a two hour limit.",

The only reason we stayed and ate is we had a $50 gift card.  Wanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty.  With three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him), the sundae and slice of cheesecake, with tip was $45).  I think that is quite a bit.  The best part was the free bread, no joke.  Service was pretty horrid as well.",

Parking on a Friday night is a challenge but they have valet if you don't want to circle around. When we checked in we were told it would be around 15 minutes but they had us seated in about 5.  Their menu is huge. Honestly, it's too big but there is something for everyone which is nice. We started with the crispy Cuban egg rolls and the stuffed garlic bread which were both excellent, the dipping sauce for the egg rolls was delicious! There was a variety of dishes from Alfredo, salads, steak Diane, another pasta dish and my orange chicken on the table and everything looked good. My orange chicken had great flavor and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The serving size was huge so I had the rest for lunch the next day. We were all stuffed but but you can't leave without trying the cheesecake. We tried the salted Carmel and a couple of milkshakes for our younger dining counterparts.  The service was excellent and our servers were very friendly and helpful.   My dinner bill for 3 with an appetizer, sodas, 3 entrees, 1 piece of cheesecake and a milkshake was $93.00 before the tip.  The only downside of the dinner was the restrooms. Two of the three stalls had no toilet paper.",

    "text": "(Part 1 of 2)    I am writing this lengthy review to let everyone know that there are those who accommodate (within reason of course) and those who hate their jobs and simply don't give a BIT (you're already aware of what I truly wanted to type).     I am immensely dissatisfied with my experience at this location (Biltmore | Phoenix). I initially dined at the bar and there was a man named John who provided terrible service. His critical thinking skills are beyond subpar and he is a terrible liar. When I first sat down he seemed rather attentive acting with urgency to make certain the counter space in front of me was clean and thoroughly wiped down (that was nice). I ordered some sourdough bread and he asked if I'd cared for anything else at the moment. I told him that I wasn't feeling well, but would like to order something for carry-out in a few moments. It all went downhill thereafter.     Firstly, all of the utensils provided to me were dirty (I should have taken photos). In all honesty, I get it considering I too have worked in the culinary field so sometimes it happens. But what truly bothered me was the fact that even several moments after my mashed potatoes arrived John hadn't noticed I set all of the dirty utensils far in front me on a dirty side plate along with a balled-up (clearly already utilized) bed napkin (you can check the video footage to confirm). I finally gave up and asked for a another fork, to which he did retrieve, however he did so in the middle of washing a glass and handed me the fork while his hand was dripping wet (ewww). AND he still didn't remove any of the dirty utensils which were placed in front of me--even after I succinctly told him they were dirty.     Again, I was not feeling well and by this point I just wanted to enjoy my mashed potatoes before they got any colder. A few minutes later I was ready to place my To-Go order. I ordered Fried Macaroni Balls for my younger sister and a small side of steamed vegetables with marinara sauce for myself. John asked me how much of a portion I would like and I re-emphasized just a small order of steamed vegetables with only enough sauce to mix them with--NOT a hefty side. Several minutes later I was given a box of reddish-orange sauce which was freezing cold and (what I thought) was my side of steamed vegetables with marinara sauce and no macaroni balls. He (John) had no idea of what the sauce was as he attempted to tell me it was the marinara sauce for my vegetables (this was the first attempted lie). I informed him that I did not need an entire container of marinara sauce; only enough to make my requested vegetables. Just then, it dawned upon John that the cold sauce was for the macaroni balls and he immediately sprung to the kitchen to make certain that they were almost ready. Upon his return, (terribly confused) I informed him that the sauce was freezing cold to which he replied \"Oh, you plan on eating it now? They probably thought you were going to eat it later which is why they didn't heat it up.\" (This was his second attempt at a lie.) Surprisingly, he then took the box and went to heat it up. By this point I was entirely fed up, but I didn't see the point in discussing anything further with John considering how oblivious he was. He brought the remainder of my items and a bag on the side. I bagged up my own items and closed out my tab. I even tipped John--STILL (I know... I know... I'm far too nice).",

You always know you're going to get tasty food, and a large serving (usually enough to share or take home half).  Plus, they've got a huge menu with a good number of veggie options (veggie burger, salads, pastas, sandwiches, etc).  I love love love their avocado eggrolls.  So much deliciousness wrapped in wonton skins and then fried, with a yummy cilantro sauce. MMMM.  Their corn cakes are also good, but the sauces on them aren't veggie; just ask for salsa instead.  I also love the brown bread they serve with all meals, even if you're just getting starters or cheesecake.  Speaking of which, they're actually pretty good, says my cheesecake snob partner (who is from NY), and big enough to share easily.  I've actually been over-serviced at multiple cheesecake locations, which I guess is better than not getting enough.  On NYE, we went here for Cheesecake, drinks and the free champagne toast; we had two almost identical servers who clearly didn't communicate, and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two. I'm not gonna argue.  They may have their off days for service, but their food is good, their menu long, and their servings big. It's hard to argue with that.",

We checked in with our name, party of two, was told it was going to be about a 30 min wait, got our pager, and waited outside since the lobby/foyer was crowded. There were a few parties waiting outside too.   40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time.   This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude.   They did seat us about a minute after.  Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried.   We always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert. We live 30 min away, so we like to make night of it when we decide to come out.",

It was extremely salty and deep fried. . I don't recall getting any cashews. We also ordered Asian salad.

My memories of CFs from back East were tons of mediocre food and great desserts. This time, however, we had very nice appetizers--avocado eggroll, samosas, and beet and goat cheese salad. My main course, the spicy chicken salad, was tasty.   The appetizer portions are generous, the main course not so overwhelming and the dessert? Too stuffed to eat it so we took it home to  have tonight! But how can it go wrong for dulce de leche cheesecake?   I would go back except that I know I will be tempted to try other restaurants in the area particularly the ones that aren't corporate-owned and have more interesting menus. That said, the few items we tried from CF's menu were A-OK. I'll probably take my son there for brunch sometime.",

However, if you are not into Cheesecakes they also have some mean ice cream sundaes and   cakes.The Black out cake is so Gooey(must have if your a chocoholic). I generally end up eating just appetizers and desserts because the dessert portions are really huge and can be shared by two (or Not).  They have a pretty extensive menu with a good variety of cocktails,Beer,Wine,Milkshakes etc. I tried the Peach Bellini which is a blend of Champagne,peaches and peach Liqueur.It was quite refreshing and tasted more like a peach smoothie nothing too strong.We also had some stuffed Mushrooms and Crispy fried Cheese.  The booths are cozy with dim lights,service was fast and friendly.This Location definitely scores higher than the others.  Cheers!",

I had the skinny-luscious steak medallions and they were tasty but surely small. Of course I knew I was ordering off the skinny-Lucius menu but it was quite a surprise to see how small they were. I made the mistake of ordering them medium - since they're so small they came back cooked pretty medium well (my bad).   The cucumber lemonade is where it's at! They muddle fresh lime in it and it's absolutely delicious!!! Our server Marcella couldn't hear us though. And she brought chocolate milk out for my kid even though I distinctly said white. She tried, however- it seemed.",

I ordered from the take out, Chicken Maderia without mushrooms, still want the sauce just no mushrooms because I don't like the texture of mushrooms. I knew by the time i got home I was going to reheat it. I opened it and sadly saw the best part missing the sauce! Bummed I reheated it for 20 minutes.  The potatoes were still not cook at all!  They were hard as a rock.  Tried cooking it longer and just pitched the potatoes.  Then took a bite of the chicken and it was undercooked!   So overall it sucked!",

I waited and waited, and called back 15 minutes later and a young inexperienced person told me that she could see them packaging up to go orders so she was sure he was on his way out.  Again I waited, 15 minutes after that I called back and asked to speak to a manager, she laid the phone down and no one came back to speak with me, 5 minutes later I hung up.

He was looking around at other people as I was speaking to him. I told him I understand it's a busy night just wish the cooks would have thought about what goes in the dish.

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory is a well oiled, fine tuned machine. They have good food, good service, great ambiance, fun atmosphere, and reasonable prices.   The first thing you notice about Cheesecake Factory is how enormous and grandeur it is. The colors are beautiful and warm, and even though it is a huge restaurant each table feels tucked away and private. This is a great place for a romantic dinner for two, or for a giant group. There is a bar area with tvs for game watching, and a patio for when it's nice outside, so there's a place for everyone to be happy.   The staff is wonderful; everyone greets you warmly and seems to love what they do. The servers are extremely attentive, efficient, quick, and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy and get what you want. They know the menu front to back which is quite impressive considering it is about 20 pages long. The most difficult thing about eating at The Cheesecake Factory is figuring out what you want to eat. The menu is HUGE, and offers everything; pastas, steaks, gourmet chicken dishes, seafood, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wings, quesadillas, and even breakfast. You name it, most likely they have it! You would think with such a large menu the food would be mediocre, but on the contrary it is actually delicious. I have never had a bad meal here or been disappointed with a dish. They even bring out warm bread and butter to get you started. If you save room don't forget their cheesecakes, they are exceptional.   Cheesecake Factory is a great place for a solid meal any time of the day. You'll find something for everyone and you'll go home full, satisfied, and most likely with lots of leftovers!",

Probably the best happy hour I've encountered in a very long while. Everything that's normally well over $12 is $5, so we went crazy and ordered a plethora of things, and they were all good.

Our waiter was very attentative, my friend thinks he hit on him though... but we always fight about which server is hitting on who! lol!

Really I did! it was like... stinging me! ouch! :'(   But I did order the chinese beef dish and that was INCREDIBLE! He ordered... hmmmm... I don't rememeber... but it must have been good he didn't complain. lol. We laughed and joked and talked and ate. We had too much fun.

I had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as \"fine\" but otherwise unremarkable.  Sorry, Penny. I hope your salary on the show increases due to the heavy product placement fees that CF must be paying, but we won't be back.",

After about 30 minutes we had asked for our check and a box from our waitress. 20-25 minutes went by and we asked again, she said \"I'll be right back.\" Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip. Never going back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Also, we never got our boxes for our leftover cheesecake.",

    "text": "OK, I'm gonna take one for the team and admit it.  Is it bad that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place?  No judging now.    I mean, I usually reject any restaurant remotely chain-like, but Cheesecake Factory, you are one of a handful of respectable chains that I like and frequent.     An easy solution when you don't know what you want to eat (you're sure to find something in the menu, yeah, it may take 40 minutes to decide, but whatever), or want to take Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Charlie from the Midwest somewhere fun, but not too edgy or Scottsdale-like.  Funny thing is I've had their cheesecake maybe about two times, because with the ridiculously large portions would I really have any room?  And if you're looking to totally WRECK your diet, this is your place - there's hardly anything healthy on the menu (but they did just start a lite salad menu).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.  I guess I like chicken, huh?  FYI, they don't have a kids menu, which is really DUMB, because this place is such a family restaurant.  For those who care, they have Valet.  I mean, come on, really?  There is a parking structure on the other side of Macy's.  Valet in Phoenix with easy parking situation = lame.",

But my friends do, and I can see how uneducated normal folk get sucked into the \"Cheesecake Factory Vortex of Doom\".  i came here for a get together with friends the other night. The menus are a bit much with all that advertisements in them. The menu is eclectic, but I definitely think the prices are borderline gouging.   The portions are big, that is correct. But, chicken is cheap, and a plate of it with mash and gravy for $16 is a bit much.   The cheesecakes are delicious, all though we were a bit bummed to find out that the cheesecake is not made in house. My friends first choice was said to be unavailable because it was frozen. That means the place is not a Cheesecake Factory, but merely a Cheesecake Depot, where the real factory trucks in the baked goodies.   I strongly feel this place is WAY overpriced for what it offered. It is a casual, family restaurant with upscale dining prices. If they had a better product, I could stand spending $60 for 2, but not when it's a sandwich and Chicken and Biscuits.",

Fortunately it was quickly replaced by my new favorite, the gumbo. I'm not really sure how a kitchen can specialize in every cuisine known to man but they manage to pull it off somehow. If i have one complaint, it's the excessive use of butter, which I can taste on my lips after every bite of almost every item on the menu. Then again, butter makes it better right?",

Their desserts are AMAZING and IF you can finish your meal, then go for their signature cakes. Simply amazing is the best way to describe their cheesecakes and other savory cakes. If I did have a complaint (besides the extensive menu which can be daunting to some) it would be that this place is usually a bit noisy, but it's also huge and often full of customers, both good signs. Try it for yourself, and then make your own decision. I've tried everything from (chicken) sliders, burgers, pasta, steak, grilled chicken and seafood.",

I understand we came around the time they were closing (they had an entire hour before close) but you still have to treat your customers with the same amount of respect that your previous customers had received. Two of us paid with our card, and the other two paid with cash, and the server didn't give them their change back. The change was about $1 and some change for the both of them, so he ended up keeping close to $3 without ever putting it on the table. My friends most likely would've given him that as a tip and then a little bit more, but no. He didn't even give them the chance to figure out how much they wanted to leave as a tip, he just never gave them the money back. So for that, I decided not to tip him, since he already decided on his own what his tip should have been. I don't want to sound like I'm trying to make things all about me, but I went there on my birthday to eat with friends and the guy after checking my ID didn't even say happy birthday. The service just wasn't there. Also, in case you're going there for your birthday expecting a free slice of cheesecake, I guess they don't do that anymore. They now give you a sundae in the smallest cup. I tried to let my food cool off once it got to me, but the flatbread pizza slid around a lot, and I ended up eating only cheese and dough due to everything falling off.",

    "text": "Received a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory for Christmas, and my husband I stopped in to use it while running errands in the area one afternoon.  I haven't eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in years, and it was about what I expected. Large variety with decent food and service.  My husband ordered two apps for his meal- chicken samosas and the fried Mac and cheese balls.  The chicken samosas were very good. I'd return for those alone. The seasoning was very flavorful and the dipping sauce was delicious. The Mac and cheese balls were solid but could use more flavor in the Mac and cheese itself.  It was the tail end of brunch, and since I hadn't eaten breakfast, I ordered the chilaquiles. The were eggs over cooked and so was pork, but the sauce good.  The service was friendly but a little slow. My drink took quite a long time to come out, as did our food.  We were too stuffed to eat it there, but we did get a slice of classic cherry cheesecake to go. I ate it a few hours later, and it was perfect.  I'm not rushing to go back to Cheesecake Factory, but next time, I'd stick to apps and cheesecake.",

    "text": "This is one of my more favorite places to go.  Decent menu selection and I love the Caesar salad dressing.  Tonight however I was less than impressed.  Our server was lacking.   He was not very attentive and slow in some cases chit chatting with some tables when other tables were waiting    Another server in the adjoining section was on spot.   He will get a less than typical tip from me as he said he would bring the check but it's been over 8 mins already and still waiting.  Finally it came. Wonder how long we wait to cash out.  He'll be getting less than 15% now.  Shame, this place usually has good service but maybe that's only when the server is female and can multitask.    Rating is 3 stars cause food was decent but service sub par.  And took 5 more mins for him to come pick up the check.   Ok 8/20 and here we go again. Order a Caesar salad and when it gets here it is shredded iceberg lettuce that looks like coleslaw.  They ran out of romaine but server never came back to tell me.  Manager is not even available to talk to me about experience. Think it's time for him or her to find a new job since customers service is not a priority here.  Will be alerting corporate now as this is become the norm at this one.  What a shame",

    "text": "I find this place to be really hit or miss with the service. Mainly miss. I've only been seated on the patio as that's always my preferred seating area. I'm not sure if they forget we're out there or what. The last time we were there my husband had to go inside to track down the server that was found standing there watching TV, literally just standing there watching TV WTH? While we were waiting for this guy and waited long enough to feel the need to track him down. The food is okay and the crabcakes are actually very good. My potatoes were served but they were not hot or even close to warm. I told the server and his response was \"do you want another order to take home\" I think by the time I got them home they might be cold again? And I would have preferred them with my meal rather than a bedtime snack. But he only found they were cold as we were given the bill because he didn't come back after the food was served to see if everything was okay.  Patio service is sub par.  Update/Last and final The crab bites are what kept me coming back but I've determined today's experience isn't worth it. I got burnt crab bites served with no plates so I ended up eating off my bread and butter plate. I did ask the server, Isabelle H, for plates but she forgot. The hamburger sliders were put on a napkin before she finally realized we needed plates. Bad service and burnt food. This is an instance where your food can't even overcome bad service.  I really wanted this outcome to be different but once again the outdoor dining service is a complete flop. Obviously burnt food actually served... I'm done.",

    "text": "So normally I wouldn't write a review for Cheesecake Factory, well because it is Cheesecake Factory and it is alway just ordinary and mostly mediocre. But after our experience this time I had to write one. This review is all about our server Charles. We usually only go to Cheesecake Factory for the happy hour food because it is decent size portions for a reasonable price. Going for happy hour means we always it at a table in the bar. We did the same thing this time but man was the experience different. We were greeted right away and waters hit the table without even asking. Charles was so happy and friendly. You could tell all he wanted was for us to have a great time, and great time we had. He was so on top of our drinks I could have floated out of there. Really, my drink (no -alcoholic) never got past 1/2 full. If it got close, there was Charles taking it away to refill it. But it wasn't only the drinks.... he was so on top of the food order, condiments, napkins.... ETC. He was everywhere! I mean it was happy hour in the bar. He had so many tables and it was amazing how he gave each and everyone the same attention and great service. He literally was like a high energy ping pong ball all over the bar. This was by far the best service we have ever received from Cheesecake Factory and we can't wait to go again but will call and make sure Charles is working first.",

    "text": "This was our first visit to The Cheesecake Factory. We were greeted nicely at the front door and shown to our table right away. This was nice as we don't usually wait, just a habit.   Our waitress took our drink orders and gave us some time to wait for the rest of our party. When she brought our drinks she tried to drop them off and run, but I caught her and ordered an appetizer. The spinach, artichoke cheese dip was typical, nothing to rave about.   Our party arrived and her drink order was taken and delivered. When our waitress came to take our order we had been catching up and my friend hadn't gotten a chance to look at the menu so she asked if our could be put in while she took a moment to look.   The waitress walked away and I actually caught her rolling her eyes with a look of disgust on her face!   When my friend had gotten a chance to decide she called her over and gave her the order. Our order that was put in about 5 minutes earlier than hers arrived almost 5 minutes after hers.   I ordered a vegan club salad, it was great.   My husband ordered the lemon herb chicken, it was so overboard on the lemon that was all he could taste. Most definitely not worth his money.   My friend ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was so tough she had to borrow my husband's steak knife to cut it.   All in all we waited longer than was necessary but we are OK with that as we were relaxing and enjoying each other's company. The waitress must of been having a bad day, but put on a smile and wasn't rude to our faces. Not worth the $100+ bill for three, may not go back, but may try another one for comparison.",

It was love at first bite for my partner and I, and we have made it a must in every trip we have made to Phoenix.  - The ambiance is very nice with subdued lighting and nice background music. Staff was always been very attentive and corteous. - Portions are generous and packed with flavor (so far I have only ordered something I didn't fully like). This last time I got the Chicken Bellagio and my partner got the Pasta Carbonara, which were LIFE giving. We had plenty of left overs to prolong our Cheesecake Factory reverie the next day. - the cheesecakes are always fantastic. I got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake and my partner got the Adam's Peanut Butter cup cheesecake. Very decadent and rich in consistency.  The prices are a bit high, but it's the CF. You don't go to be all dietetic and stingy. All in all it has become one of the best chain restaurants I have ever visited.",

This type of restaurant not only serves their signature cheesecakes with various flavors and toppings, it also serves typical lunch food (BLT sandwich w/ fries, appetizers) and Happy Hour.  It's more of a grown-up family and friends type of place moreso than families with kids.  There is also a patio to sit out and enjoy (loud) company and tolerant weather ;)  The servers are professional and happy to take your cameras/phones to snap pictures as per your request (so that the restaurant backdrop can show ;) ).  The atmospheric lights are dim with the restrooms even more dim.  The ambiance and room temperature are at a comfortable level and while it's casual dining, it's better to put on something nice being this is Biltmore and the restaurant chain started out in Beverly Hills, California.  That is only if you want to fit in.  I usually come here to enjoy original-flavored scrumptious cheesecake.  Have tea with it-  it's a plus for your palette ;)  Even the plain cheesecake is that filling so eating a lunch with it could cause my stomach to explode ;)  There is a bakery in front if you'd like to purchase their cheesecakes.  Thanks!  BTW, I love the revolving entry door :)",

The way they handle parties of 6 or more is ridiculous.  I tried to make a reservation for 20 people, could not do it because they do not take reservations.  I get there earlier to get a table and wait for my friends to arrive.  They said they will have one ready for all of us, but could not let us seat at the tables until at least half showed up. So there they kept us for about 45min until we were a total of 10.   To me that is total bullshit, is in the middle of the week, not too busy, just a fiasco from that point forward.  If you are planning to have a big dinner, birthday dinner, or anything involving parties of more than 6 people choose a different restaurant. TOTAL BULLSHIT.",

    "text": "So we go to eat after a volleyball tournament.  Not a hard decision - it's the Cheesecake Factory.  Already know it's gonna be good.  HOWEVER.....we walk in and woman (I did not get her name - apologies) greets us like old friends - we crack a joke - she is adorable.  LOVE HER.  So we are all happy and looking forward to the good eats and then enters Jeff.  OMGosh.  Jeff is the best waiter we have encountered in YEARS!!!  Years I tell you.  And I eat  A LOT.  So first, Jeff is professional and awesome.  AND THEN my daughter orders a burrito without meat and Jeff asks if she wants extra beans - daughter says no, it's okay and Jeff says, well, I will have them add extra beans and veggies.  We look at each other and are impressed.  That could have been it.  He already earned a great tip but there is MORE.  He hooked us up with bread fresh out of the oven.  He nailed it with filling up our waters in a timely matter and hooked me up with buffalo sauce for my sandwich because he felt there just wasn't enough on it for me.  WHO DOES THIS?  We were treated like royalty.  Seriously.  Little things make it and JEFF is the man.  Super cool guy and a really great server.  I would hire him in a minute for our business for customer service.  This guy rocks.  I went so far as to ask for the manager to tell him how impressed we were with him.  Jeff, seriously - thank you.....it matters!!!!!",

The tiramisu cheesecake is the best I have ever had.  Even if you do not like cheesecake you will love the tiramisu. The standouts for the appetizers are the buffalo blasts.  They are like shredded chicken deep fried with cheese around it dipped in buffalo sauce. Oh it's so so good. I also like the factory burger for my main dish. It's a hamburger in sour dough bread with onions with fries. Trust me it's really good. My wife and I always go on eachothers birthdays so the workers can sing to us. Great food, service and setting.  I love this place.",

We were sitting outside for about 20 minutes waiters kept going by we got up and we were ready to leave when a server approached us and asked if we had a server so we said no  and he went and found who our server was.  Elizabeth than came to our table and said I kept wondering why no server was  checking up on you guys  turns out I'm your server. She kept making excuse after excuse not once did she apologize. By the end of our dinner we were already so annoyed by her she tried to get us to have desert and kept  trying to force us to have desert and than made a stupid comment  \"are you guys gonna make me run around here like a chicken with their head cut off to get you guys to order desert\" which we still have yet to figure out what she meant  by it. The bill then came you would've thought that when two people are spending almost a hundred bucks for dinner and drinks it would've been nice to have something taken off the check. Nope you're wrong not with Elizabeth. Oh and once more she made an excuse for making us wait 20+ minutes when the restaurant wasn't even busy. This happened about 3 months ago and I'm still furious about leaving her a tip. We've been back since and always make sure we don't have Elizabeth.",

    "text": "When Cheesecake introduced their monstrosity to the Biltmore years ago, I was turned off by breathless staff pushing drinks and skimpy desserts, and by longer waits than a GP's office in flu season. But I have to say that, over time, I've warmed to this conglomerate - even as I subsequentyly learned that eating here regularly might kill me.      The staff has settled in and mostly toned it down, and now our entire family revolves through CF's front door with confidence, and suspiciously early for dinner, to avoid waiting room rigor mortis.  Overall food preparation is at least one notch below Houston's across the street and one notch above adjacent CPK, which is more impressive than it sounds considering the legendary breadth of Cheesecake's menu.     It's all respectably prepared, if fattening, and often quite good.  I like the fish tacos (standard fish but massive fixins) and the portabella and asparagus omelette. Mom gravitates towards sublime corn tamale cakes, and Chris is seduced by a salad presented in two huge conical mounds he likes to call \"Dolly Parton\".    There's an item or two on this menu to pique anyone's interest, and while the Factory probably wont serve up your best meal ever (unless you dont get out much), a truly disappointing meal here is rarer than Steak tartare. Portions are large and we almost always pass on dessert.   Not the kind of restaurant to whip out an engagement ring in (this is a Factory, after all), but a safe choice for the family, stargazing (Suns opponents staying at the Ritz eat here all the time), or a pre-movie dinner date. Well, safe until you die.",

Or does it actually just drive me mad causing me to drive my salad fork into my forehead while perusing the ad-riddled pages? I'm always here for the comfort food. And I don't order those ridiculous salads, large enough to fill the salad bar at Soup Or Salad! Frankly I simply cannot digest all the raw roughage in one sitting. Cauliflower is no longer my friend. Yesterday I ordered the Hungarian Beef Ghoulash. Meet was very tender, gravy was too salty and the egg noodles that came with were a bit bland. I guess you need to ask for a gravy or sauce for them, cuz they was jest naked. Rickie's meatloaf, tasted just like my entree...I swear...I tasted no difference in the sauce. The Buffalo Chicken triangle thingy appetizer was different and tasty. Crispy, spicy triangles of lightly battered something or other filled with chicken. With so many newer places opening up all over town done in minimal/urban decor, The Cheesecake Factory really sticks out like a loud relative at a dinner party. Hmmm...will I go back? Probably...too convienent after movies at the Esplanade. And if I try everything on the menu eventually, I know I'll be navigating my walker with the yellow tennis balls attached, but I'm bound to find the fresh, consistent and comforting dish I so want.",

Fries were cold). We ordered the kids' pasta for my son and it was just that- a bowl of WAY too hot pasta (I just don't know why restaurants serve kids' meals at 1000 degrees). But that was it, just pasta, no veggies or sides. It is a family place no matter what they try to be, it is a big loud place that people bring their kids to, is it too much to ask for a nice, healthy meal for my kid? But I digress. Again, loved the service but the food was underwhelming. Luckily I really enjoyed spending time with my family and that made it fun :)",

No one liked what they ordered the only thing I enjoyed was the appetizer and my glass of wine. We had to return a couple pasta plates because they were so salty I mean really salty unable to consume. May I add these plates are around 20 bucks each. You can find way better restaurants for the same price range even cheaper. We should've gone to the vig like we initially planned but we wanted to try something new. Oh well now we know we for sure won't be returning. Lots of better food options out there!",

I asked the same question. She replied \"NO!

I would have liked to see a little more variety.  The waiter was younger and very prompt and professional.  I ordered the eggs benedict and my fellow dinner ordered an egg combo with a bagel.  Everything was tasty except the break.  With my eggs benedict, the english muffin was toasted to beyond the point where I could cut it with a knife.  The bagels were rock hard.  I was fine with not having the english muffins, but my friend spent 10 minutes to try and get another bagel.  In the end, we just gave up and enjoyed what was left of our food.    Despite any shortcomings of breakfast, the cheesecake makes any meal better.",

My husband ordered spaghetti with meatballs and I ordered the Chicken Madeira. And of course a slice of Oreo cheesecake!! The orders were very generous!! And delicious! My husband prefers his spaghetti sauce more saucy but the flavor was great! My chicken meal was delicious with yummy sauce. But, I forgot to get a photo!! The cheesecake of course was the Star!! Thanks Cheesecake Factory for helping a working Lady bring home the Bacon and Dinner!!",

She was kind enough to keep us updated on our tables and they would take us back shortly. As soon as we were taken to our table our waitress greeted us and asked for our drink selection. Considering there was 13 of us the drinks came out really fast and no mistakes. She then took all of our orders and was very friendly. I ordered the filet mignon medium with veggies and mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked exactly as i ordered and let me say i cleaned off the plate. We all then ordered cheesecake to go and they have an extensive selection on cheesecakes. That by far was the hardest part to decide which one i wanted. I really enjoyed it here and will be back to try other foods from their endless menu choices.   This location in particular can validate your parking so make sure to take your chip in with you.",

From the minute we got there the service was spectacular! The hostess (I didnt catch her name, but its a lady with dread locks) was so darn nice! We got a highchair for our baby, she cleaned the entire chair for us, carried the baby, and assisted me to get my squirmy baby in the chair! I mean... who does that?? She acknowledged my whole family! My 7 year old is a chatter box and she listened to her whole story about her dance recital she had just had that day!  Our Waiter was Kyle, very, very nice young man! My Parents speak no English and we often get looks and huffs and puffs from Waiters when we have to speak Spanish, but that was definitely not the case! Kyle took care of us, he was very attentive and extremely patient with us all! We've never had better service! We will most definitely be visiting this location more often, your customer service makes the drive worth it! Keep up the great work!",

In the moment, the Chicken Madeira I ordered was extremely tasty alongside a great pile of delicious mashed potatoes. Afterwards, we enjoyed a slice of the Coffee Cream Chocolate Supreme cheesecake, which was very tasty as well. All of the staff we interacted with were nice and provided great customer service. Unfortunately, this is where this story takes a turn.  At about 3 am the next morning, I developed a horrible bout of food poisoning, leading me to vomit profusely multiple times. Looking back, I have no doubt that the chicken in the Chicken Madeira dish was undercooked, giving me this horrible illness. Looking back on the meal, the chicken did look a tad off unlike most chicken that is cooked correctly.  I will never return to this location nor any other Cheesecake Factory location due to this incident. This has simply ruined the experience for me. I hope others can read this and think twice before ordering a chicken dish at The Cheesecake Factory.",

Unfortunately, the pineapple upside down cheesecake was all gone which left me having to decide on another dessert. I chose the strawberry shortcake. However, when it arrived I was very disappointed. The shortcake was very hard and cold, not fresh whatsoever. On the top of the shortcake their was a sugar crust made with raw sugar. The strawberries were the best thing about this dessert.

    "text": "We had a VERY disappointing experience here Friday night. I called just after they opened to see if I could bring in a cake for our server to bring to our table for my daughter's birthday. The manager I spoke to was pleasant and confirmed that, yes, I could bring in my own cake, and just let our server know that I had brought it in.   I took the cake and bday candles to them early in the afternoon, and the hostess who took it made a note that it was mine and then put it in their fridge up front.   Once we arrived that evening, I spoke to the hostess (on the DL, so my daughter would be surprised), and asked her to tell our server Brandon that the cake was for my daughter and to bring it out with the candles in it after dinner. The hostess followed me back to my table so she was sure to talk to the right server about the right table/party.   Dinner came and went. It was all very good, but expensive, which is expected there. Then the bill came, and I tipped about 25% because I appreciated the extra trouble of them letting me bring in my own cake, etc.   But after the server took my money, we never saw him again - and no one ever brought out her cake!! NOTHING!! After we waited a while and realized it wasn't happening, we decided to leave. When I stopped at the front and explained what happened (or what didn't happen) and asked for my cake back, the man at the counter casually handed it back without making any effort to make the situation right!!!   I was so disappointed and felt so bad for my daughter to not get the the birthday fun I thought I had set up for her.   Bad job, Brandon and Cheesecake Factory. You really dropped the ball.   The next day I wanted to complete the online survey about my experience, but realized too late that having the receipt handy is required, and I didn't have it.",

Never got the the kids menus, ordered only appetizers and another hour later I asked another waiter to check on our food. Found out it was ready but they were holding until the entire table was ready. Took 20 minutes for our check that I asked for when I got my food, which i had to go and get it! Asked for a manager and she was so rude. Never apologized about us being there for 3 hrs with 3 kids and forgotten about. I've never been to a place that was so disorganized.

The skinny menu is great when I'm dieting, and the low carb cheesecake was a great cheat - I am a big fan of the burgers for when I inevitably fail on my diet. The highlight of the most recent meal was our server Joe C, he was hilarious and offered great service - if you read any of my restaurant reviews, I pretty much judge a restaurants service based on whether I see the bottom of my soda glass, and joe kept me very hydrated",

    "text": "Not usually a big fan of chain restaurants, but I was in town with a friend visiting her dad, who wanted to take us here for lunch... free lunch, so who am I to argue.   Much nicer ambiance & decor than most chain restaurants & a lot of menu selections, so pretty hard to not find something you'll like. After hemming & hawing about what to order, I finally settled on the California Cheese steak sandwich (minus the mushrooms... hate mushrooms), which was freakin' delicious! So few good cheese steak places in San Diego & I had to come to a chain for an amazing one. So many cheese steaks are either bland or so overloaded that you don't really taste any distinct flavor... just a big mash up of food overstuffed in a roll that all spills out as you try to eat it. The sandwich tasted just as good as the menu picture looked... hot juicy flavorful grilled steak, with ooey gooey melted cheese, along with onions & peppers. The cheese perfectly molded everything together so nothing falls out as you eat it. What makes the sandwich so good is all the ingredients compliment each other, but the grilled steak flavor was still dominant over the cheese, onions & peppers. The fries were pretty good, but weren't quite hot enough... I could tell the fries would've been a lot better if they'd been hot.  My friend had eaten too much meat on this trip already, so she opted for the Cobb salad & loved it! She gave me a bite & it was definitely one of the better Cobb salads I've had before. Her dad ordered a burger, which he said was really good, but he got jealous when my sandwich arrived... he didn't see it on the menu.  Zaida was our server & what an awesome server she is! Very friendly, personable & an adorable smile. Checked in on us enough so we didn't really have to wait for a refill on anything. Service can make or break a restaurant... I mean who wants to go to a good restaurant where the servers are either not very friendly, or just going thru the motions, but Zaida was excellent at making us feel welcome.  Just the regular old cheesecake was amazing too, but I wish they didn't have to put the calories on display right in your face. Felt a little guilty at eating a 1200 calorie piece of cheesecake, but we were on vacation, so there ya go.",

Everything felt a bit dirty and a lot uncared for.    While once probably a nice go to location,  the Camelback Cheesecake Factory felt more like Denny's older brother,  attracting the budget minded (although pricey menu- but there are generous portions).  Certainly won't make our dining rotation.  Too many really good choices at the same price point.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, back in the 90s, this building was Planet Hollywood. Back when Planet Hollywood had multiple locations all over the place. Although I guess that's irrelevant now. Anyway, Cheesecake Factory is one of those places, much like Olive Garden, that I might visit once per year - not necessarily as a desire, but simply because I received a gift card for the restaurant.  It's funny, because I always read these articles about Cheesecake Factory struggling, but yet, their parking lots are always jam packed with customers. A family I work with considers them their default choice for celebrations, so clearly the place has its appeal to certain folk.  Their menu, quite frankly, really freaks me out. Not necessarily because of the caloric content that they often get criticized for, but the sheer size of it. There's really no real sense of direction with the menu, as it's almost if they're trying to cover virtually everything imaginable. If they specialize in something other than cheesecake, I'm not entirely sure what it is.  Anyway, I decided to play it safe and ordered an old fashion burger, while my girlfriend ordered half a chicken salad sandwich, which was more than enough to feed one (normal) person. I substituted out their fries with a side of mac and cheese.  Overall, I found my burger to be comparable to what you'd find at most chain restaurants. Not particularly great, but not really bad either. The mac and cheese was a bit on the bland side, while my girlfriend wasn't really impressed with her chicken sandwich in comparison to some of the great ones she's had at some local establishments. She claimed it was just a bunch of mayo, very few almonds, and didn't really taste like chicken breast. The lukewarm (loaded) potato soup was mediocre at best. On the plus side, we've both always enjoyed Cheesecake's complimentary hot bread and butter.  Now, as for cheesecake, I've never really been a fan in its traditional form. However, there's a ridiculous amount of creations here for dessert, to the point where most people can find something that they'll like. Years ago, I'd default to their Chocolate Tuxedo, but we decided to take a risk and go with their Hazlenut Crunch, which is topped with Nutella. It was actually decent and as good as I remember their cakes being, so that's one thing that I feel this place can deliver on.  Our server was very friendly and chatty, more than happy to provide her opinions on some of our menu choices. We definitely have no complaints there.  Overall, Cheesecake Factory is what it is. It will never be a place I'd visit regularly, but I think that for an occasional visit, it's perfectly fine.   And as for their fans, I'd imagine that it's virtually impossible to get bored with their extensive menu.",

The bartender John was very professional and helpful.  The food was phenomenal. I had the Herb Crusted Salmon (although I personally wouldn't call it 'crusted') and the Steak Diane combo. It came with the famous mashed potatoes - which are a must no matter what you get. I came with my co workers for dinner and we all enjoyed our meals. The salmon was cooked perfectly and not dry whatsoever. The steak was a little tough for Medium-Rare but it had a pleasant and warming taste.   No matter who you are, there is something for everyone at CCF! I recommend going through the plethora of pictures or at the very least scan the menu before you visit the restaurant, otherwise you will find yourself reading a book of the menu. You can get any of the pastas and be full and then some. The portions are very generous and worth it!",

I got the egg roll sampler.   15 minutes later the food arrived, which I don't think is bad for a wait. The presentation on the plate was great.  The taste, nah. Jack in the Box egg rolls are better, and cost less.   I'll probably go again, but only for the desserts...not so much for the lunch/dinner menu.   The atmosphere was relatively quiet which I like.

My family and I frequent this location often but will no longer be patrons due to their discrimination against my infants stroller.  There was no wait and plenty of tables were open and available.  Aside from being told that they could not accommodate my child's stroller and could not seat my family AT ALL because of our stroller, I was then called a liar to my face by the hostess who deliberately lied to the manager when I called him over in saying that she didn't say we couldn't be seated when in fact she did. I was told \"we cannot seat you and the stroller\" by an eye-rolling, brunette hostess whose mid-drift was exposed (which I'm sure is against company policy).   The general manager, Rick Fredrickson, defended his employee's lie without listening to my account of the situation. I explained to him that his employee needed to learn how to service the customer and find solutions instead of telling the customer \"no\" to something that was completely within her control and her only job...to find her paying customers a table so that I can contribute to her paycheck and ensure that she is able to continue to buy more too little shirts to wear to work when she denies paying customers a table to sit at.    The manager and the hostesses at this location did not provide customer service on any level and we will not be back.",

Our selections were the chicken taquitos and chicken potstickers. For those of you that have never dined here be prepared to read the novel they call a menu. It's actually a little overwhelming and is probably a reason why their prices  are on the high side.  Waitress took our order and asked if we wanted bread, which we declined but it's a nice gesture. Food arrived fairly quickly and was pleasing to the eye. The taquitos were actually two whole cut into four pieces with a very tasty green salsa on the bottom of the plate with a drizzle of a avocado based sauce and a sprinkling of Pico on top. These little bites were perfect in every way. Crispy, a little spicy. I would order these as a entree next visit so I wouldn't have to share. The chicken potstickers looked great too. A slight golden brown crust on two sides placed in a large bowl with a thin asian inspired soy ginger sauce. The sauce was amazing, I could have drank it. Even though they were cooked perfectly I wish the chicken stuffing, though plentiful wasn't spiced enough for me. They needed more ginger or garlic...something to give them a little more umph.  Overall it was a good dining experience, I do think for the portion size the value wasn't really a bargain.  I love how the menu has calorie counts for those watching what they eat. $27 and change was our total without tip.",

    "text": "Another carbon copy of all the other cheesecake eateries. At certain times of the week this place can be packed. However, if you arrive just before closing time on a Sunday night, you won't have to wait to buy your favorite cheesecake to take home and savor.  This Cheesecake Factory is situated in the Biltmore mall on Camelback. If you crave cheesecake this is the right place to come.  If you are counting calories (oh dear, wrong restaurant!) let someone else read the menu and then you probably should skip everything that they have on the menu.  Almost every slice of cheesecake is a gazillion calories.  The wait people were very personable and helpful, even right before closing time.",

    "text": "I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch with friends, but wasn't sure what I would get. It was nice to discover an item marked as vegan on the menu - the vegan cobb salad. The salad was tasty, but way too big and too expensive! And salad doesn't do well as leftovers. The beets and chick peas were my favorite of the veggies on it. The lettuce was fairly lame - mostly iceberg, but the dressing was okay.   They also had the Impossible Burger, but it didn't look like the bun was vegan and the server didn't point it out when I said I was vegan and asked for suggestions. There was also a pasta I could veganize, but a salad seemed easier.  Our server was great - just the right level of attention. Overall it was a fine experience, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",

At first I was hoping that the whole cheesecake was over 1,000 calories, but alas no, that's just one piece. And, I should learn to just half the slice and share it, so then it's like only 500 calories (ugh). Maybe, I should half the half to get to the calories that I should have for a slice, but nah, let's just eat the whole thing (slice not cake).  I'm definitely a fan of the cheesecake here, but I'm just not such a fan of the calorie intake on a slice of cheesecake even though it tastes sooooo good.   And, there are some mouth-watering flavors by the cake or by the slice. Since it was my daughter's birthday, she chose the flavor--white chocolate raspberry truffle. But, that mango key lime looked delicious and so did the salted caramel. Oh, let's just face facts, they ALL looked delicious.",

The menu has definitely expanded since the last time the two of us had been there, which made the selection process very difficult - haha. We ordered the fried calamari to start, which came out with this thick garlic sauce, almost butter like, which was fantastic. The cool on the calamari was perfect.   For our dinner, we ordered three small plates that we could share, which was so worth it. The fried cheese, mashed potato tots, and empanadas were amazing! Can you tell it was cheat day for us? Haha. Everything came out promptly, our server was so nice and was on top of her game.   We ordered dessert to go since we were full by the end, but our experience was great. Parking here is hard to find since it's in a shopping center, but the whole area is clean and well kept. The restaurant itself was clean, but I had forgotten how dark it is inside! Would recommend for a splurge night / date night, it is a bit pricey.",

    "text": "I have so many fond memories of this (Biltmore) and the Kierland Cheesecake Factory locations from many years ago... Back in the day, I didn't mind eating at chains, but now when I dine out, I prefer to eat at more locally owned establishments.  That being said, there's always a time and place for a visit to a chain.  One of those times was last week, when my husband and I were gifted a Cheesecake Factory gift card from my parents (thanks Mom and Dad) in honor of our anniversary!  We took the kids and headed over and I was admittedly excited.  I told my kids about the large menu, the fabulous food, the tasty lemonade, and the delicious desserts...   We were seated on the side patio upon request, which was great, and we had a decent experience.  The reason it was decent (3 stars) and not all that (5 stars)?    Well... the service wasn't as friendly as I remembered it being.  It was also on the slow side.  My omelette came out wrong, so by the time they corrected it, my family was almost done with their food.  It also needed salt, which was missing from our table, but I figured it may take awhile to get, so I did without it.    Everyone else enjoyed their food, and once mine arrived, it was good, albeit it could have used some salt ;).  The lemonade was as good as I remember... go for an Arnold Palmer!  And of course the cheesecake won't disappoint.  We went for the original on our visit.  I am also a fan of their carrot cake, which I plan to get if/when we return.  There is something for everyone here, which is the big reason to go... just keep your expectations in check and you'll be fine!",

But otherwise their pasta was OK Ok and also their white chicken with rice has a weird taste to the gravy .. not good at all.  Of course if you are here, the cheesecake has to be the dessert and we ordered the carrot cake flavour which was fine.. but it wasn't as expected (a bit on the dry side)",

Everything is very fresh and tastes great. It's a huge menu though which can be frustrating if you are hungry. We are talking everything from Asian to a simple hamburger. Not to worry though, you are going to like whatever you try.   My most recent visit I had the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer and a classic hamburger. Both were outstanding!   Staff is always friendly and if something isn't right, they will make it right with no questions asked. They can substitute just about anything on the menu as well.   Cocktails are pretty darn good too, there is a large cocktail menu as well.   You can also visit Grand Lux Cafe, Cheesecake's sister restaurant. Different menu, but just as extensive. Just as good too!  Enjoy!",

No ranch as requested.   2. Bread was refrigerated cold.  3. Seats were dirty. Gf had to grab a napkin from another table to wipe off the seat before she could sit down.  4. Walked passed a bus tub overloaded with dirty dishes just sitting in a booth... not a good impression walking to our table.  5. Fries were not hot.  The food and service were good. Wouldn't recommend or return to this location based on our experience though.",

    "text": "When going to this restaurant location specifically I recommend parking in the paid parking lot across from the entrance. It will give you a little yellow token that you can validate when you are leaving and will save you the hassle of trying to find a spot in this busy location.   Now for the restaurant! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to and the only Cheesecake Factory location I really like. The atmosphere is very lively sometimes noisy and most workers are very friendly and helpful. The lighting is rather dim in certain seating locations. I would say it is \"too romantic\" when it comes to the lighting if that was a lighting setting.   Almost all of the servers I have had in the past were great with timing, knowledge of the vast menu, friendliness and attention to your needs. The food is always great and I have never regretted my decision when ordering. The Red Sangria and Moscow Mules were perfect for drink choices. I even ordered an A.M.F. (a dangerously blue heavier alcoholic drink. Those who know understand) which was not even on the drink menu. I was surprised on how accommodating this location was. They even bring an extra plate if you are sharing a dish and have split it up before. I recommend the Shrimp Bistro Pasta or Chicken Madeira for a main entree and the Portabella, Avocado and Zucchini Fries for an appetizer. Those are just my go to choices.   The only problem, as with every other Cheesecake Factory or Man vs. Food competition, is trying to reach that last bite and in this scenario it's the cheesecake. This cheesecake is probably more total calories than all the food leading up to it and it's worth it. If you ask for a cheesecake to-go container you will put it in the fridge only to open it up before bed and finish it.  I highly recommend this location and restaurant chain and don't forget to validate before leaving.",

Mimi, the host, sat us down at a booth not even 5 minutes from when we walked in. Even though the restaurant was full, they always attended to our needs and never did I feel that we were left forgotten. If you are in the mood for a drink, I recommend their passion fruit mojito, the citrus flavor with the mint leaves are always a perfect combination. For our appetizer, we had the Fresh basil tomato and cheese flat bread, this is a must and you will not regret ordering it. The cheese with the perfectly cooked tomato were a perfect match, and throwing on fresh basil gave it the fresh taste you expect. Of course, why visit Cheesecake Factory if you are not going to order some cheese cake. We had the Tiramisu cheesecake, and it really did took us to heaven. So, if you are looking to have a nice date or a great night out with a great environment, good customer service, large portions and good food  I strongly recommend.",

    "text": "Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants.   Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once.   I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta.   When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else.",

My husband and I always leave with that warm, satisfied glow and feeling comfortably full. There's no greasy, yucky aftertaste like a lot of places.  Our favorites include the crab puffs, the asian chicken salad, their burgers and their penne spaghetti. They have a meal for just about any taste or craving and have the most enticing deserts! We had a raspberry-white chocolate cheesecake that was absolutely to die for! They have awesome rye bread, which you get for free before your meal to nibble on.  The service is usually pretty good and we never really have any complaints. The staff are always friendly and helpful and always have positive things to say about the food we're ordering.

Todd, the manager said he'd send us a gift card but that it would take some time because it comes from California then he'd mail it to me. So I waited and waited fast forward to January and I speak with Tracy, another manager allowing them to try to fix this one more time before I write a review and she was very friendly said she'd get back with me and she did, she let me know that the person in corporate doesn't work weekends (because I called on a Saturday) I was fine with that but here we are on Tuesday and still no word.",

    "text": "I went to Phoenix to spend time with my Grandmother. She is going to be 86 this year and has been having a bunch of health problems so when I told her I would be coming to town, she asked if I would take her to see her financial planner who works in this area. He is great and often drives all the way to Sun City West to see her or they conduct business over the phone and email. Since it is schlep for my mom to do this, I was happy to take her. We had an appointment around 1:15 and since Gram moves a bit slower than either of us expected, our plan to have lunch before the appointment didn't work out so we had lunch afterward. This is how we ended up at CF. She was starving and knew they had a lot of options and she didn't feel like Miracle Mile (and I knew I could eat at the one in Arrowhead)  Cheesecake Factory is CF. I know now that I like their burgers and I love their garden salad. It is full of great veggies like shredded zuchini and beets. Gram had the meatloaf and ate about 3/4 and then decided it wasn't as good as it used to be. I refused to let her send it back (one of her favorite things to do-eat more than half and then complain so she gets either a comped meal or another meal that she takes home for another time)-yes,I am outing her trick and she knows I am on to her....  She let me pay because I didn't let her send her food back. Luckily and our waitress was a doll who totally got it. She was from San Jose so we had a good time chatting about the Bay Area and the differences between here and there.   The reason why I am not giving this location 4 stars is because the slice of cheesecake we ordered had some nasty strawberries on it. I have a good taster and when I bit into one it was like biting into an overly acidic chemical taste. I told the waitress and she brought us a plain slice. The waitress told the manager who came over to tell me that NO ONE had ever complained about the strawberries before. I told him to taste one and he looked at me like I was crazy. A few minutes later, our waitress came to me to tell me that the manager did taste the strawberries and that I was right -DUH. Had he come back to tell me this himself, he would have bumped up the star rating in service...  Gram said she likes the location in the Arrowhead area better, though we did have a good time talking about all the changes in Phoenix and the Biltmore area.",

    "text": "To be honest I used to live off the best menu item which was the juicy portabella mushroom burger, I would pick it up for lunch at least 3x per week, in addition to going there for dinner....a total addiction until they took it off the menu. That's ok, I needed a change. I love the Thai lettuce wraps with peanut dressing that's another serious addiction. The sweet Hawaiian salad tastes like candy. All of the salads are among the best salads you can get anywhere. The Chicken Marsala is fantastic. The simple four cheese pasta is crack. Oh the salmon rice dish with a light lemon sauce will fill you up yet you'll feel good. Those suggested pasta dishes are really good. Steak and ribs was ok, yet I order that at a stake house. Fish and chips yummy. Burgers are fantastic. The size of the burrito reminds you of your first born child. So again, I'll admit when I lived down the street at the Biltmore Estates I went here for dinner at least 4x per week at my sons request. But it's always nice and quiet, easy to have great conversations.  Consistent quality food, tons of variety to satisfy everyone's  tastes. Esp great when you don't feel like doing dishes. The appetizers are all very good as well.",

    "text": "I've been to Cheesecake Factory about six times, about three of them at this location. I'm not much of a fan of chain restaurants, but I must say the decor and ambiance have been nice and the restaurant always clean.   On a past visit I had a Buffalo Chicken sandwich which is no longer on the menu...and probably with good reason. It was the sort of quality I'd expect from a fast food drive-thru, only a larger portion and served on a plate. This time, I had the Cuban Sandwich with a Green Salad side. The sandwich wasn't bad, just not memorable. The portion was plenty for lunch and some to take home. My friend had the equivalent of Chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti (don't see it currently listed on their website menu) which he downed in no time, despite the large portion. At the server's recommendation, we shared the Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake, which was fresh and flavorful.   The second server (the first one's shift had ended) was late in bringing some water I'd asked for. While I wasn't concerned about it, he noticed his own service was too slow and he promised to \"make it up\" to me. Not sure what that meant and I never saw any benefit.   While the portions were more than ample, I'm not sure the prices are in line for the quality being offered. Two lunch entrees with nonalcoholic beverages and one dessert came to about $50.00. For the money, I would've preferred to go elsewhere.   I will say I've stopped by the carry out counter for cheesecake to go before and absolutely LOVE the Lemon Raspberry and will always consider it a \"go-to option to-go\"!!!",

We ordered the lunch Renee's special - 1/2 sandwich, side salad AND a cup of soup.  I loved this option and it's rare, you usually pick 2.  The cup was more like a bowl, the 1/2 sandwich was still a good size (LOVED the chicken salad with almonds) and the side salad was also pretty big.    I love their bread basket, especially the wheat oat - yum!  The kids got nice sized portions of their meal - great options for the young ones, too.  LOVE the $1 ice cream scoop.  I love coming here and always want to come right back to try something else on their huge menu.",

From 4 to 6 Monday through Friday you can enjoy drinks and appetizers for $5 each or so. I like the Mojito and the Cosmo too. My husband has had the pink lemonade drink and enjoys that a lot. The real draw here is the food. You can order many of their appetizers which usually run $10-$13 for around $5. The best part is the happy hour burger that my husband always orders. Unlike most places that only have sliders this is a full size burger and fries can be ordered with it for a dollar or two more. He loves it as he can have an adult beverage and a burger and fries for like $12. I enjoy several of the appetizers especially the shrimp spring rolls and the avocado egg rolls. There are other things on the menu I am tempted to try but I keep going back to my favorites. I have dined at the Cheesecake Factory outside of happy hour and it's still really good but happy hour is the way to do it!",

The good thing is that most items (even salads and sandwiches) will get you multiple servings unless you're super hungry. I'm a fan of their rye bread. People think I'm weird when I compare other calamari to the one that's served here.  That said, I wonder how much of the food is actually prepared fresh from scratch. A lot of the dishes are drenched in salt. My friend couldn't eat his pasta because it was so salty.  Service was slow and \"meh\" at best. Cheesecake is good for its convenience and familiarity. In the future, I'd rather spend the same money or less at a local restaurant.",

    "text": "The other day, i took my holiday guests to share dinner at yourBiltmore location. My friends had arrived from Paris and were famished. I chose your establishment because of the extensive selection of menu items and the quality of food. It was approximately 5pm and we decided to enjoy our meal on the patio where it was relatively quiet.   Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted promptly and seated immediately. I was concerned because I didn't see anyone else eating on the patio which typically means the server sometimes can forget they have people outside. Our table was clean, music was at an acceptable level, the sunscreens were pulled down and everything seemed perfect, then...our waitress arrived and introduced herself as Nikea. At that precise moment, our experience began to change.   Granted, had been shopping all day. My guests were experiencing jet lag from their travels. Their English is not that great which required translation and patience just to get through the menu. The four of us were hungry, but we just couldn't believe nor did we ever expect what happened next. Nikea created an environment which made us feel as though we were being welcomed in her own home. Not once did we ever feel rushed nor did we feel like red headed step children for sitting on the patio. She had other tables on the inside  but somehow knew when we needed drinks or her assistance. She made reasonable suggestions and was present for our entire meal.  Although we had just met, she created an atmosphere in which I felt as though I had known her for quite some time. One might ask what exactly did she do?  Everything. Absolutely everything was perfect and exceeded my own expectations this making taking our dining experience from perfect to a remarkably extraordinary epic experience! If she isn't part of your training crew, I would highly recommend you consider making her one. Her mannerisms, attentiveness and overall professionalism was superb, but it was her personality which boosted her A game and placed a personal touch on our experience.  I truly hope you take the time to share this with her. Thank you Nikea for a remarkably relaxing and memorable dining experience. Entertains guests from foreign countries who have limited knowledge of the English language is very exhausting and sometimes stressful. Thank you for making this an amazing dinner for me and my guests.   And if you are reading this to her, I hope you give her a great big hug for me right now. You absolutely put the \"awe\" in Awesome!",

I decided to try this location out for my birthday meal since I was craving their chicken chipotle pasta. We started out with the standard bread basket and I had a strawberry lemonade. Our server was crazy busy but he still took care of us for the most part. My chicken chipotle pasta that I also add shrimp too was so delish the sauce is a little creamy but has a kick to it from the chipotle flavoring. The asparagus, tortilla chips, chicken and shrimp  just work perfectly with the sauce and the penne pasta! This is def. my go to entree at the Cheesecake Factory. For dessert since I'm not a fan of cheesecake I went for the carrot cake and it was everything I wanted and more! Moist delicious cake with nuts, raisins and carrots and just enough frosting.   I have also met my girls at this location several times for happy hour and they have an awesome menu menu with $5 appetizers and drink specials! And the portions are huge 1 appetizer can serve as a meal or can be shared easily.   Cheesecake Factory never disappoints, I will always be a fan :-)",

I hope I get a refund then\" and he responded to us \"go get your refund then!\" As if it was our fault that these technical difficulties were in place stressing this man out! We just tried to get food! I have no idea what the mans deal was but thanks to him we will never show at this crappy ass customer service Cheesecake Factory. Couldn't even give us an explanation or explain that we would be refunded our money. There wasn't a sign on the door - just locked doors, one man inside, and that's it, we weren't even the only people picking up, there were two other individuals waiting outside confused, trying to call the inside of the restaurant!! I never got an email or call saying the order was not going through AND I was charged. Now I have to call my bank in the morning - thanks Cheesecake Factory",

Reeses was delicious but let's be real, you really cannot mess up a Reeses cheesecake... The red velvet however was extremely lacking and almost flavorless (minus the obvious super sweetness). I'm not a fan of processed food and pretty much everything that comes out of their kitchen (almost any chain restaurant) is processed. Too many gourmet scratch kitchens throughout the valley that I would prefer to support",

    "text": "Poor staffing. We were crammed into the entrance, standing room only. While waiting amongst chaos I noticed the whole patio open. It was dry, clean and perfect for the overcast weather. When I asked about being seated there I was told that the patio was closed because there was not a server available for patio. The wait to be seated was 45 minutes standing shoulder to shoulder. After finally getting seated we arrived to a booth in a very lovely setting and my hopes were rising. After searching endlessly for vegetarian options for our family I asked the server where on the menu I could find vegetarian options. He informed me that there were not many options and that they were randomly placed. He referred me to salad. Desperate for comfort food I ordered stuffed mushroom appetizer and angel hair plain noodles. I cut up the mushrooms to use on top the noodles which took a very long time to come out. I added a squeeze of lemon from my water and made myself a half way decent vegetarian meal. The noodles were incredibly over cooked and tasted more like top ramen mush so there was only so much I could do. The booth forced you to sit directly upward with no room to relax at all so before I had even received my food my back was hurting. To be fair the staff was kind and the cheesecake was very tasty.  Better to just order cheesecake to go and skip the whole restaurant experience.",

    "text": "9/30/2018  Yelp Review  The Cheesecake Factory Tempe AZ Biltmore Fashion Park  2402 East Camelback  Phoenix, AZ 85016 US 602-778-6501               The Cheesecake Factory is an amazing  place to have a great dinner and to unwind and relax with a friend. Yesterday was my first time ever dinning at The Cheesecake Factory and it will now be a place I come to frequently.              The food was very tasty from the beginning to the end. The sweet brown and regular white bread as amazing. The brown bread wasn't too sweet so i was able to still enjoy it. The bread was also brought out nice and hot so the butter was able to melt perfectly on the bread before I ate it. The white bread was simple but somehow even taster than the brown bread. For my main course I ordered the BBQ Burger medium rare which perfectly melted into my mouth. The onion straws were the perfect level of crunchy which allowed each bite of my burger to be soft yet crunchy which really sets the burgers apart from your average fast food burger. The BBQ and ranch Sauce mixture on the burger gave the burger a sweet yet refreshing taste. The fries were nice and hot and had the perfect balance of salt. Overall the food was 10/10 in my opinion.              The Atmosphere and Service was fancy yet casual from the start. When i walked in everyone was nicely dressed and I was greeted by very kind words from the host stand. I had to wait about 5 minutes for the rest of my group of 5 to show up so I got the chance to walk around and check out the huge variety of cheesecake. The whole place gave of a professional yet causal appeal. The lighting at my table was a little darker than I would expect but the booth was very comfortable. My server was a taller man who was very kind and helpful from the start. He brought refills constantly and always checked up on my table to make sure we were okay. He gave very good advice on which type of food to get and even gave his personal favorite foods from the restaurant which was a great help to my friends who were undecided on what to get. His appearance was very professional and acted professional the whole dinning experience. The only thing I wish he did was say his name so I could thank him for his service on this yelp review. My server was also great at pre busing and was very quick to bring me and my friends sides of ranch and to go boxes.               Overall I paid 30 bucks plus tip for a great time with amazing food and some of the best service I've ever had in my life. I highly recommend anyone trying to go on a nice date or have better food with some friends to make your way down to The Cheesecake Factory and you will not be let down.   James Jack Foley",

We did have to send the waitress away initially as not everyone was ready to order. Once we were all ready to order, she was nowhere to be found. Finally she arrives and takes our order. An order of the brussel sprouts was placed to arrive before the meal. It did not. The entrees took a good 30-40 minutes after ordering to arrive, so by now it is roughly 12:30. We inquire about the missing brussel sprouts and were told, \"oh, your food must have come out first.\" Um, ya think? I got a margherita pizza that looked like a very bad grocery store brand frozen pizza. Very little cheese and what looked like a single leaf of basil cut up and distributed between the 8 slices (one sliver of basil per slice). Halfway through our meals, the brussel sprouts arrived. One in the party ordered an old-fashioned burger hold the tomato. It came without lettuce, pickles, mayo or tomatoes; only onions. The others felt their burgers were okay but did say they were so salty they were almost inedible. Service was not good and their prices have really gone up. We left the restaurant at 1:15! Two hours spend waiting to order, waiting on food that wasn't good, waiting on the check, etc. I don't expect to be back anytime soon.",

When i said yes may i please have a look at the menu he literally made a face and handed me the menu as if like he was annoyed. We finished our dinner and he asked if we wanted a cheesecake to go and we said yes that we needed a minute to look over the menu and he rolled his eyes at us.

I got seated during the regular dinner hour on a Thursday within about 10min of walking in. I sat near the bar area (not on a high top) and loved it because it was moody and cozy. We ordered the Korean fried Cauliflower bites to start and OMG,  just get that already! I've tried cauliflower in so many different ways throughout the years and this definitely makes my top 3 list! Absolutely dee-lish! As a vegetarian it was pretty much salad, pastas without any meat (a little overpriced for my taste) or a veggie burger. The veggie burger was pretty good but I wish it either came with a cool sauce or when it gets delivered it actually has the condiments you ordered with it (like mayo, mustard, etc.) I waited about 5 min to get these (lucky for me, I actually don't mind room temp food). My server was busy taking an order at a different table so not really her fault. The pork chop dish my partner got was really great, my veggie burger was ok as were the fries. For dessert we ordered the 30th anniversary cheesecake which was VERY, VERY delicious! Took that to go because I was full. All in all, we had a nice dinner and experience. I don't eat out at chains too often but have always enjoyed my Cheesecake factory meals in the past.",

    "text": "The Factory is winning with its appetizers. They aren't cheap, but from small plates to small salads, I don't remember having an app I didn't like.   On my latest visit, I dared to try the fried Mac and Cheese balls. I kept wavering at first, because I couldn't imagine their mac and cheese tasting any different than a box of pre-packaged stuff lurking in my pantry. But whoa! The dish knocked my socks off. Can I get an AMEN for comfort?  The nicely fried balls were close to 2.5 inches round with large noodles mixed with creamy cheesy goodness. I don't know what blend of cheese is used, but I was happy that I couldn't taste american cheese. And it wasn't as greasy as you would think. The mac balls are topped with a tomato-cheese dip that also taste pretty good. Four balls cost $11.95  Avocado Egg Rolls (11.95) speak for themselves and the accompanying dip speaks for everything else:  Six half rolls per dish are served on top of some useless white crunchy sticks that I ignore every time. I forgot to ask if I could substitute lettuce for them. At least then the egg rolls would be sitting on top of something pretty. Oh well, maybe I can save packing costs by using the sticks as padding for the next package I send for X-mas.  Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes (10.95): I've ordered this before and wanted to try a second time. Yes, it's a comforting dish. Sweet corn kernels are baked into three tamale pancakes and covered in garnish of avocado, pico, cream, and some kind of relish (which I just realized today) tastes very similar to Thousand Island.  Would I go to the Factory without ordering cheesecake? No, no I wouldn't. Ever since I had a good run with the STruessel (which they no longer carry unfortunately) I've been tasting other flavors. This time I decided on the Lemon/Raspberry, dulce de leche, and white choco/raspberry. Hmmm, I like all three.",

    "text": "I literally came for the avocado egg rolls! The dipping sauce that is comes with is a sweeter flavor and then  mixed with the salty egg rolls are a good combo!  For another appetizer I ordered the appetizer caesar- the thing was huge!! and this was the appetizer size? Defiantly could split the salad.   For main entree got the chicken Bellagio! It was good , nothing special to write home about. It's a flatten chicken cutlet over a bed of angel hair pasta and like a pesto sauce. To me cheesecake has this large menu but lacks the \" taste\" factor since they have such menu!  Ordered the red sangria to drink with the meal - it was tasty but I was pretty appalled that it was $9.25 ..I could have easily had three.",

My pasta was wonderful although it unusually served with some kind of bread it was not,  being they serve bread at the table for starters it was not a let down to me. My boyfriend really enjoyed his as well although the portion size was I'd say a lunch size. The cheesecake is of course to die for. We had salted caramel cheesecake and yum! I am not one to eat sweet treats often so it really hit the spot. They have so many different options on the menu. Something there for everyone. The service was good our waitress was  kind and very assertive. The manager even came by our table and saw we had ordered 2 biscuits that we didn't eat not do to them not being good it was just we were full he was kind enough to take them off the bill, even when we told him that was not necessary. I would return again for sure.",

    "text": "What the heck happened to CF?!!!  My wife and I were very excited to take our kid to experience what used to be a \"sure thing\" for us back in high school. It used to be that service and quality was above par here each visit.   While on vacation we visited this location.   Where do I start?  First, our server Erin was AMAZING! She knew the extensive menu cover to cover. Not just the popular items, she new each ingredient, sauce, protein and made recommendations based on our preferences.   At the end of this experience, the manager Adam was very nice too.  That's all the good I have to say.  The table we were sat at had a 2 inch by 3 inch chunk of the granite or what ever stone material the table was made of missing! The entire corner of the table. Luckily I noticed and told my 6 year old not to touch it. We didn't want to be moved because by the time I noticed it we had bread and drinks wanted to get on with our meal.  It took over 30 minutes to get our food after ordering. A party of 12 was sat next to us well after we ordered and they all had their food about 3 minutes after we got ours. It took so long that our kids were bored and ready to go. So we asked for boxes and took it to go.   Before we left I noticed that my Farfalle chicken was missing the chicken!!!! They took it back and added chicken to the dish. Also, my dish, essentially a bowtie pasta, was the same portion. Size as my two daughters pasta dishes from the kids menu. I paid $20 for a kids size dish!  We ordered cheese cake to go. Red velvet, Celebration, and Tiramisu. They were all just okay. I remember when CF cheesecake was to die for.   My wife's hibachi steak was okay. Not bad but not really good. It came with wasabi mashed potatoes. There was no wasabi flavor and they were incredibly dry and grainy.  In the end, the manager Adam comp'd one of the cheesecakes, whoopty do.  We spent just shy of 2 hours and $120 on that experience. My server was so awesome that we still tipped %20. Everything else was lame.",

When you have to use your cell phone just to see the menu, and I am by no means visually impaired, well maybe they could consider some type of ambient light. There was nothing. Not even a candle. A small pendant light would have even been good. There still wasn't enough light to read through the menu.  Waitstaff was okay as well. She might have been pretty new though. She did do a good job.",

Anytime I've had a problem in the past the manager has asked how he could help. Nope not this time. Erin blamed the bakery for taking so long but others with other waiters got theirs quickly and no manager visited when I sent my Cheesecake back. Used to be one of my favorites places to go because of the variety and service. But nope! Never coming back.   Oh and I forgot to mention she brought a birthday  sundae but when I mentioned I no longer wanted the cheesecake she took it back until I raised a stink! Nice birthday memory for my daughter!",

We waited for nearly 30 minutes and requested a booth and was sat in the bar area in at a small section. We let it pass because it was considerably busy and we were hungry. Our server was less than par - he waited on every table except for ours for nearly 10 minutes before he even offered to take our drink order. When we finally got to order 20 minutes later it took an additional 25 minutes to get our food. No where in that time did our server check on us to see if we wanted refills and it wasn't until the table 6in away needed boxes did our server even check in on us. Once we got our food we were ready to go. We asked for our food to be boxed (as most other Cheesecake Factory's will box it for you and he had just boxed the couple's food next to us 10 minutes prior) he threw down 3 boxes (for whatever reason, there were only two plates on our toddler sized table) and when we asked for the check it took an additional 10 minutes to get and another 10 to have picked up. It's safe to say we won't be visiting this location or any other for a bit, it was majorly disappointing.",

One thing I don't like is whenever they bring you something with a dipping sauce of any kind, they bring it in a tiny dish and you always have to ask for extra.  Okay, maybe I am just a pig and eating too much sauce.....but seriously, would be nice to at least ask \"is that going to be enough sauce or would you like an extra one.\"  Anyway, I am nit picking (otherwise I wouldn't be much of a critic), but the place is great on all other fronts!

The waiter did his best to catch the Roach without success. The waitress apologizes for the floor and the roach. Eventually the manager came over and offered to waive our dessert that we didn't even order. So he wanted us to pay more money for an subpar experience. I can see why this restaurant has three start rating. The restaurant is subpar, the floors are always dirty with food from the last guest and now they have a roach issue and we weren't even compensated correctly for our troubles or just to simply make it as right as possible. For this reason we will probably never return although we live 2 minutes away.",

We were seated immediately & it took 10 minutes to get someone to take our drinks order. Now. Some of you might be thinking, \"You're being unreasonable.\" No. Think of a place that you go for service where is acceptable to be acknowledged after 10 minutes when is not busy as fuck. This place was no where near busy. We are then greeted by Giovanni who was plenty friendly, but not a great waiter. After taking our order we advised that we were on a break from work so we would like the check immediately. We received our check last.  Our food arrived with 20 minutes to spare from our break. He said that he would bring to go boxes with our order. Not only did we never get a to go box, but we had to borrow one of there mother fucking napkins to bring our food with us. Again, I know some of y'all are thinking, \"Bitch, you didn't have to bring your leftovers!\" Yes we did. We paid for that shit. In conclusion, hold your shit to a higher standard instead of letting your wait staff get so high. Be as baked as you would like, just handle your high & bring us a damn doggie bag!",

We sat at the bar an ordered a Flying Gorilla to split. It had little chunks of chocolate in it and was pretty tasty, no complaints there. The server brought us bread out as well. The brown bread was good, but the white bread was hard as a brick. We also ordered a Smore's Galore cheesecake, and sweet baby Jesus was that a sugary slab of something. It was delicious, but made us both a little sick to our stomachs after a few bites. Not sure how any human being could consume a whole slice in one sitting. When I went home I looked up the calorie count out of curiousity- it was about 1,600 per slice! No wonder it took us three days to finish it! Next time I come, I'll bring a party of 6 for a single slice of cheesecake!",

I've eaten here several times and I've never had a bad dish here. We enjoyed a couple of small appetizers first and I ordered the corn fritters and a plate of stuffed mushrooms. The meals came with a basket full of complimentary breads. For small plates, they sure give you a lot. I was getting full just from eating the appetizers.  We also ordered the shrimp platter, breaded salmon, mashed potatoes, asparagus and washed them down with Raspberry Lemonade. For dessert, we got the white chocolate macadamia cheese cake. OMG.......Heaven. Totally scrumptious.  I felt like a total heifer and if I eat here everyday, my booty is going to get huge!

Service was horrible. They insisted on taking our order a certain way but when the food was delivered, they had no clue who ordered what food. There were 2 servers for our group. One server was scheduled to go home and rushed some of us to pay our bill. They didn't check on how our food was and at the end brought us the bill without even asking if we'd like to order dessert.

    "text": "I can't review the food here because we never got seated! Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much.   We called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave.   I have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could. Had the hostess we'd spoken to earlier in the day not said it wouldn't be a problem, we would have made other arrangements for dinner that night.",

    "text": "Our server Georgina, took our drink orders and left. When she returned, she had forgotten to bring a tea for one of our party. Moments later, holding a tray with a cleaning rag on it, she dropped the tray just beside me and splashed both myself, and my friend sitting next to me. I absorbed most of the splatter, in my mouth, left eye, and face. She fortunately was only splashed on her body and hand. Georgina didn't even say anything to us, but picked up the tray and kept going. After a few moments of waiting, I got up and went to the restroom to clean myself off, since I didn't even have a place setting or napkin at the table. On the way back, I stopped and asked to speak with a manager. A young man with curly hair, and square framed glasses was brought to me and didn't give me his name. I told him our situation, and what had happened. I told him I could not only smell, but also taste the cleaning solution that had been on the rag and tray. At first I asked if it was bleach based, and he assured me it wasn't. Then he said he'd talk to our server, and left things at that by turning around to talk to the hostesses. Clearly, I was dismissed. So I returned to the table, disgusted, upset, and smelling of cleaning solution. My appetite was ruined at this point, so I choose not to order anything. Having chemicals splashed into your mouth, even a few droplets, will do that to a person. At this point, our friend STILL hadn't received his iced tea. We flagged down a passing server and asked her if she could bring it for him. She went back, and came out with the wrong tea. Now in this, I say it wasn't really her fault. She wasn't our server, and didn't know what type he had asked for. Correcting that issue was minor. Next up, comes our long wait for our orders to be brought out. Georgina hasn't been back to our table for at least 15 minutes at this point. Another young man stopped and dropped one basket of bread and a small dish with 4 butter pats, to serve a group of 7. Another long wait, and the table next to us, who were seated after us, and ordered after us, gets their meals. At this point, my left eye was feeling irritated, and I went to flush it out in the men's room with water as best I could. When I returned to the table, our orders were just coming out. And my roommates order was wrong. He had ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp, and NO asparagus. And he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles. At this point, he notified the food runner who had brought his dish that it was wrong. The young man said sorry, and then walked away without offering to replace or fix the order. he decided to just pick out the asparagus, and deal with it since he was hungry, and didn't feel like waiting another 30 minutes. At this point, Georgina has appeared at our table 4 times total. While refilling glassing, she is reaching directly in front of my roommates mothers face, my face, and our friend seated on the other side of the booth. No excuse me, no words at all, and STILL no apology from her for the splashing. While my friends ate, I again went to the restroom to flush my eye. I again stopped to speak with the manager from earlier, and asked him for the name of the chemical used for cleaning. He immediately told me that \"I already told you sir that we do not use bleach products here.\" He furthermore told me that he had spoken to our server, and she said she didn't have any cleaning solution or rags with her when she dropped her tray. Outright calling me a liar as I see things. Please take into account, from the beginning I told the manager I didn't want anything, and wasn't asking for free meals, or drinks, or desert etc. I simply wanted the name of the chemicals used, so that I could give that information to a doctor if I felt the need to seek out treatment. He informed me that they didn't use chemicals for cleaning, and then said they used a sanitation solution. I'm sorry, but that would be a chemical. I pointed that out, and told him I was very upset with how this had all been handled. I made it clear again, that I wasn't looking for anything from him, except the name of the chemical. He asked if there was anything he could do to make my evening better, covering my meal or anything. I once more told him that I had chosen NOT to eat, after getting splashed and having that rancid taste of chemicals in my mouth. He then said he would get me the name of the solution used, after my having exhausted every other avenue, and telling him I would be contacting the corporate office. At this point, I told him I was done with the conversation, and wanted nothing more to do with him, as he clearly didn't care about the situation. The rest of our evening was spent with little service from Georgina. She had come and taken a desert order from our group while I was speaking with the manager, without even asking if I had wanted anything. Granted, I didn't. She didn't speak a word to me the entire time after the first complaint, and treated",

    "text": "Normally I would never pick to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, ever, but a co-worker picked it for a work function, so off we went.   There were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first.   I have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue.   The other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side.   Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless.   As for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much.",

It's so delicate and at the same time the chocolate is not too overpowering the flavor of coconut mousse. The calamari is great, they cooked it just right. I'm highly satisfied with choosing this restaurant for dessert!",

Hostess should be welcoming , accommodating and friendly.  For they are the first person you see when you enter.    Great fried zucchini though !!",

I have been to the cheesecake factory several times and in different states and cities and every time I have gone I have ordered something different. However, I have always been satisfied and delighted with my dinner. Nevertheless, to say that the servers are very gentile and attentive with their customers. The complimentary bread they serve is amazing I can literally say that I can stuff myself with bread and be a happy camper. I would totally make them a five star restaurant.",

    "text": "So the first time I was considering going to this location, I was warned from my friends who work in the area that the last time they were there that they had to give some sort of warning due to a hepatitis a issue they were having...  Anyhow, onto the actual review... the food overall has been mediocre at best.  Usually something's overcooked or bland.  The service each time has been relatively good.... and the personalities tend to surface.  The second to last time I went with a friend and we had dessert.  Ordered coffee with a shot of Baileys and had a slice of cheesecake each.  Our waitress was VERY enthusiastic about the cheesecake.  To the point of us being ever so slightly uncomfortable, but she did claim to have gained tons of weight at the start of her job due to having a slice every time she worked.  I suppose if you're surrounded by it, it could happen.  Dinner wise, however, the portions are difficult to finish for the average appetite, but I tend to gravitate toward their small plates menu and order a couple of things off of that.  I also enjoy their Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's a good place to go if you have a bunch of people who like a variety of things or just can't decide.  This definitely is not my choice of places to go, but usually more like a... oh, we know it's open, it's not that far, and no one is in the mood for anything specific sort of place.",

    "text": "The last time will be the last time.  Yesterday at CF, waiter was passable. He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer, and did not do so until asked.  Food and drinks were good.  However, at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels. Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, \"It's just a spill.\" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband, shirt, wheelchair and wheels. We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle.  The manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning; then the waitress said she was sorry. No comp, no apology until we cleaned up ourselves.   Even worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched.  This was weird deja vu.    Maybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible, and they don't know their limit until they exceed it. Ha.  Overall, food was good and service was sub par. Attitude was LOUSY!  The customer who is paying about $25.00 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy.   Better luck when seated at the bar, on past visits. No spillage.",

    "text": "Big fancy chain restaurant? Big insane menu? Big servings? Small prices?   Dear Cheesecake Factory,  Say hello to your newest fan! I always imagined The Cheesecake Factory to be one of those places you go to for a boring corporate meeting or on a date with one of those cheesy guys who believes that this fancy Biltmore location will woo you off your feet (replacement for charm).   After trying this place out, I have completely changed my mind! The menu was extensive with an impressive variety of plates! I ordered these Vietnamese rice paper rolls that were just as delicious as the ones from the Vietnamese deli down the street. My friends ordered plates that were huge and mouth watering! To top it all off, the prices were extremely low and an exceptional value! I'll be stopping by whenever I'm in a mood to eat beyond my means :)   The staff was nice, nothing over the top, but with great locations and great values, the service is over shadowed by the food!",
