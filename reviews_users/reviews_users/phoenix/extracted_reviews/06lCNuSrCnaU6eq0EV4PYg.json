    "text": "Went back to Province last night - ask for JESSE, he's the best server I've EVER had downtown.   Again, the food was AMAZING: we had the goat cheese fondue, which you would think would be weird, but it's whipped with something else, perhaps cream cheese or some whipping cream, and it was fantastic.  We had the homemade pasta and lamb and both were out of this world.  The lamb with hominy just melts in your mouth and the pasta is served with a mixture of veggies.  We also had a serving of asparagus and for desert....squash muffin with honey ice cream.  It was light and sweet, with a fantastic \"frosting\" and the ice cream was perfect: it tasted just like you were eating honey.  We also tried the manhattan, margarita, and the smart money. I usually always avoid mixed drinks when going out, but the drinks I had (the margarita and smart money) had the great, fresh ingredients, so I knew I would have a headache or feel like I just ate a pixie stick.",

    "text": "Checked out Province last night and had a great experience. The inside of the restaurant is very nice if maybe a little cold design wise. There were 3-4 other tables of people so it felt pretty empty which didn't help but Im sure that will change as the restaurant becomes more known. We were seated pretty close to the entrance and could see there was a pretty constant stream of hotel guests coming in with their luggages which I liked.   The service was outstanding. The waitress did just the right amount of checking in with us throughout the night and was very prompt when needed. The chef sent out two appetizers on the house, the first was a cracked wheat salad with almonds and some other ingredients, it was very good. Everything we ate throughout the night was great, no complaints there. They also had a great Czech beer which I'd never had before, it was awesome and 6.2% alcohol content to boot!   The patio wasn't open yet but we wondered around it a bit and sat down for a minute. The views are great and the music is louder than inside the restaurant so it was more of a lounge feel. I loved being able to watch the cars and people going by, very urban feeling. One thing that was interesting was how windy the courtyard was...there is a serious draft going through there yet the streets were pretty calm when we left.",

    "text": "Had an amazing experience at Province inside the Westin Hotel.   First of all, the hotel and restaurant are beautiful. I love the manzanita trees and fuchsia wall. The bathrooms were also very clean and modern.   Went on First Friday and it was completely dead, which is very sad to me. People need to go to this hidden gem!   The menu is tapas style so my friends and I ordered a bunch of items including:   Crispy White Corn Croqueta with ancho aioli  Mini Cuban Chicken Sandwich  Summer Squash Taquito  Grilled Tomato Flatbread  Melted Goat Cheese Fondue  Grilled Ahi Tuna Tacos  Potato Frites   My favorite was the Summer Squash Taquito. It came with just one small taco and it was just a bite, but it was very good.   I would love to return to Province and sit outside once the weather is cooler. The ambiance is very chic.   Complimentary valet for the first 3 hours is a plus too.  Go to Province people!!!",

Even though it is in the heart of downtown, the patio has been designed for privacy and comfort.  The manager and his staff go out of their way to make your visit a wonderful one.  Go on a Friday evening, and see the flamenco dancers.  Me and a friend went last Friday night, and a flamenco guitarist played music while male and female flamenco dancers danced.  It was wonderful. Dinner, drinks and a free show - you can't beat it!  Oliver was our waiter, and he was just great.  He is friendly and professional, and was able to give us good suggestions to meet our dietary needs (gluten allergies).  This is one of my new favorite places!  I will definitely be back for more.",

The atmosphere was fantastic and we got very lucky with such a nice night, just loved the design of the patio. The service was fantastic as well, I never went without a drink or had a dirty plate in front of me for long.  The fondue's were amazing, it was so rich and flavor full it went great with the chips provided. I was also amazed by how much flavor was in the caprice salad, the pesto on there was really good. I thought the chicken mojo skewers were well cooked and had a great flavor.  My favorite part of the night had to be the desserts though as those little churros with the chocolate were great and well sized for a good bite and easy dipping. Then the ice cream came out. I am not normally a fan of coffee ice creams but the cappuccino/mocha (i forget which it was) was fantastic. I had to get a second round even though I was stuffed.  Huge thank you's go out Lindsey and the Yelp staff along with all the staff at Province, they really were well prepared and did a great job showing off the restaurant. I am going to be sure to come back soon.",

So, Sweet Pea and I, along with B$ and one of his girls, and K-Dawg went here last night to celebrate AZ Restaurant Week, a couple of bdays, and well because we can.  I was very ready to like it because it's downtown and supposed to be local/organic/whatever.  Unfortunately I didn't like it.  No, I didn't.  This place is completely generic, people!  Generic environment, generic food, bad service...that sums it up.  You know what?  It even bores my @ss to discuss the food at all, so let me just give you the lowlights:  They said the bloody marys were their own mix and spicy.  If that's their own mix, they should check out Mr. T's because it's better...and spicier.  When asked for more spice, they gave Sweet Pea a little room service bottle of tabasco.  They forgot B$'s drink, and when reminded, tried to play it off.  They did nothing for birthdays.  They were supposed to give us two glasses of wine as our wine pairing and the timing was totally wrong...we had to remind them that a red should have come with our entree.  Although we were one of three tables in the restaurant, the food runner wandered around the dining room with our food while we watched, trying to figure out whose it was.  Oh, the goat cheese fondue was just kinda ok.  Hotel restaurants can be good.  T. Cook's, Lon's, etc. etc.  This is not one of those.  The only reason I can see to eat here is that you're staying at the Westin and don't want to leave the property for some reason.",

Our amuse-bouche was a cold spinach soup that was alright but needed something else. Some taragon maybe? I'm not sure but it needed something to brighten it up but it was a unique offering on a rather warm evening so it worked.  The spring squash taquito was meh. Some zuchini squash diced in a little crispy taco shell. The shrimp and grits were excellent, though! Shrimp was well-cooked and the grits had a nice texture and the manchego worked very well.   For my main, I had the papardelle which was very good. I got a half portion since we'd had some plates to share before and it was plenty for a light supper. The pasta was cooked just right, the olives and manchego and peppers all worked very well and it was just a lovely late spring dinner.  However, the portions, even as a small plates restaurant, are extremely tiny on the shared plates. The prices are not bad but are still a bit high. The staff, eh. Our server tried very hard but some things were forgotten, some were brought out completely wrong, etc.   So overall, I may come back but I won't be in a huge rush. The concept is fun and fresh but it needs a little perfection on the execution to be great instead of just decent.",

They have a decent area outside for drinks and light bites.  But it's pretty close to Central so it may be noisy if you go immediately after work.  Neither of us ordered a main course; we did a menu sampling.  Here's the run down:  Croquetas - sweet potato and goat cheese balls covered with crushed pumpkin seeds.  They were good.  Truffle fries - average.  Not hot when delivered; looked as though they were not cooked when order but a while ago and sat under a heat lamp  Pretzel chips and goat cheese fondue - this item gets a 5 star rating.  YUMMY!  Grilled veggies - not much to say  Steak tacos and shrimp tacos - average.  The \"Stack\" desert is just again, average.  Caramel ice cream between 2 thin crispy things, similar to a cracker and baked apples underneath.  The bill for all of this, a Coke and an iced tea was almost $60; thank goodness for the coupn.  Our server was the best part of the evening.  Very nice, willing to recommend items and seemed to be genuinely interested in making sure we had a nice evening.  The valet attendants were also providing excellent customer service.  Based soley on the food, I won't go back.",

This is a great place for \"work\" type meals because it's upscale and the service is quick and professional. The acoustics are good, so while the restaurant was pretty full, it still seemed quiet and it was easy to converse. The restaurant is quite pretty, with natural and modern elements well fused, big floor to ceiling windows which let in light, and a nice little patio with a fire feature.   I had the black bean burger which just...wasn't that good. The house made patty was very thick but also very dry and flavorless. Yes, it tasted like black beans, but I think some cumin, garlic, and spices would have gone a long way. The menu mentioned it was served with chipotle aioli, but mine was missing, and I didn't want to interrupt my conversation with flagging down a waiter and getting it fixed. I'm sure the overall taste would have been better with the punch and moistness of an aioli. On the lunch menu there was another vegetarian entree (tofu) and two pizzas that were vegetarian as well.",

    "text": "Province serves up \"provincial\" in an urban, contemporary setting.  I knew lunch would be something to remember when I entered the Westin Hotel lobby.  It may seem like a small thing and it was more of a lobby detail than restaurant detail, but the place smells AMAZING!  It's not the smell of food, but an aroma of clean-meets-floral-meets-subdued-men's-aftershave that made me stop in my tracks to take in the moment.  So, on to the restaurant.  The decor is refined-urban-contemporary and is nearly as inviting as the perfume in the lobby.  It's clean and comfortable without being pretentious.  Our server was friendly and advised us to expect South American flavors.  While he and the bus person were both very attentive, I did find it odd that we were never asked the typical \"Is everything OK?\" question, though everything was more than OK.  We started with a crudites which included a pair of warm mini-muffin shaped carbs of some sort (pardon my ignorance), three pieces of crunchy, flat bread sticks (which to me tasted like glorified Goldfish Crackers) and a mini ramekin of velvety chickpea and dill dip.  The dip was great, but I could have passed on the rest.  My friend started with the (pictured) Tortilla Soup (avocado, rotisserie roasted chicken) which I'm told was creamy and robust with flavor.  The chunks of chicken were meaty and moist.  We shared the (pictured) Heirloom Tomato & House Made Mozzarella Salad (pickled onions, cilantro almond dressing.)  This was almost too pretty to eat with its artfully arranged colors of heirloom tomatoes and the oh-so-flavorful pickled onions.  For the entree my friend ordered the (pictured) Spice Rubbed Grilled Shrimp Tacos (ancho aioli, pickled cabbage slaw, house corn tortillas) and am told the (what seemed to be braised) shrimp were very good.  I ordered the (pictured) Grilled Berkshire Pork Tenderloin (anson mills grits, brussel sprouts, adobado.)  I requested to substitute the brussel sprouts and was easily accommodated with a switch to a vegetable medley.  The pork was super moist, though just shy of evenly cooked.  The adobo sauce was flavorful, but not so overpowering that is took away from the flavor of the meat.  The grits were fine but I couldn't get enough of the mixed veggies (carrots, squash, onion, kale, etc.)  On the way out, the hostess chatted us up a bit and we learned the decorative moss wall is real...she mists it every day to keep it thriving.  The bartender thanked us for stopping by, even though we never had an opportunity to have a drink at the bar.  He tells us the pink chairs positioned at an angle are supposed to be inviting.  Between the inviting pink chairs where I haven't yet had a drink, the delicious food I couldn't get enough of and an outdoor patio with fire pit that looks like a great spot for day or night, I'll be back invited or not.  And if I arrive late and they're closed, at least I can still take in the scent of the lobby.",

    "text": "Being inside a luxury hotel that shares its building with the biggest mining company in the world, but being stuck in the middle of downtown Phoenix, I'm going to guess that Province is a big hit during the week.  But on a Saturday night in June, my wife and I practically had the whole restaurant to ourselves.  Not to say a quiet evening out wasn't appreciable.  The biggest pro about Province was its great service.  I really liked our server who was very attentive.  There is also a $50 for $25 gift certificate on local dines (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2Fphoenix%3Fref%3D19485&s=13f273d311728f7448ff75fcf55bdaf2585245ad2d7e3c3cc0823dcdee2befc9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/phoenix?r...</a>), but it's only valid for dinner at this restaurant.  The biggest con is that while the food is not bad, it's not really worth a trip downtown.  We all know that downtown isn't the happening place in the valley (even on a Saturday with the D-backs playing the Giants just down the street), but there are a few unique spots in the area.  I respect the overused farm-to-table concept, and the food was fresh and flavorful, but not anything that begged me to come back for more.  If you find yourself at the Westin and don't want to walk down the street in the summer heat, then by all means give Province a try.  I personally would hit up a few other places that are in the immediate area first.",

One person had mostly greens with only two or three small chunks of beet, and mine had absolutely no goat cheese. When I brought this to the attention of the server, he had to check there was supposed to be cheese in it before bringing me a small cup of goat cheese.  Several of us also ordered the seafood stew. Not only was the broth extremely tasteless, the odor was very fishy, to the point that non-seafood eaters at the table were offended by it. The small chunks of crabmeat were overdone.

Excellent service, always a step as head of us   It's somewhat expensive -but the patio with its secluded feel in the city and water wall to cool - along with the food, staff and overall ambience, make it worth the price!",

    "text": "For a long time, I have been looking for an upscale restaurant where my hubby and I can go when we are on a date night seeing a show downtown. There aren't really that many nice spots within walking distance of Orpheum Theater or Symphony Hall (I hate having to park twice) where I feel comfortable when I'm \"all dressed-up\".  Most places in the area cater to the ballpark crowd. This restaurant totally fit what I have been searching for... so it very ironic that on my first visit to Province I was in shorts and a sci-fi t-shirt and sweaty after a day of walking around the crowded Phoenix Convention Center. You see, in addition to being Restaurant Week, it was also Comicon weekend!  Even though it was not specified in the menu online, I was pleased that the first course was supposed to be shared since most of the restaurant week menus at other places we had gone ended up being way too much food. We love Mexican seafood so we ordered the shrimp coctel. We both enjoyed the flavors in this dish very much, but agreed that this was not an authentically prepared version compared to when we have eaten it at various places. Also, it was served with no accompaniments and only one spoon, which I found odd. In Mexico it is usually served with saltine crackers and most American places provide chips or tostada shells so it is a pet peeve of mine when you get neither. For my second course, I got the tomato soup which was absolutely delicious except for being too salty; though that may just have been me since food tends to taste too salty to me when I am a little dehydrated. My husband said it tasted fine to him and he also really enjoyed his Caesar salad.  For our main entrees, I ordered the paella and he got the strip steak.  The steak ended up being a really large juicy piece of meat that was quite delicious, as were the side vegetables.  My husband is not a fan of eggplant so he gave me the mini empanada that was on his plate. I thought it was fantastic! I also really enjoyed my paella, even though it was not what I was expecting. The rice was very soft and there was a lot of cheese. There was no shellfish or meat of any kind in it. Really, it was more like risotto than paella. But I love manchego so I thought it was really tasty. For dessert, we each got a trio to sample: a peanut butter and chocolate flan, strawberry mini tart, and a papaya cupcake. We both liked the cupcake the best, even though the coconut frosting was overpowering.  From start to finish, the service was impeccable. I am truly surprised to read some of the other reviews on here. I loved the decor and was completely enchanted by the living art on the wall next to the hostess stand with all the moss and ferns sticking out. We will definitely be back to enjoy their awesome patio for happy hour next time we are downtown... or maybe for a pre-theater meal!",

Our bartender Genia was super friendly, out going, and enthusiastic. Genia's fabulous customer service is the reason we chose to enjoy our dinner at the bar. Genia was helpful in recommending meals to try. I went with the cauliflower steak and the house salad which were amazing!! Even if you aren't a vegetarian(which I am not) I strongly encourage you to try the cauliflower steak. My boyfriend had the tasty chicken and rice soup along with the Mahi entree for dinner which he throughly enjoyed. Genia was also helpful with our drink choices. She recommended beer for my bf to try and offered samples without being asked.   What a fabulous restaurant with even more fabulous employees. Genia rocks!!!",

    "text": "Really hit or miss.  First of all, the atmosphere is terrific.  Modern, minimalist, big open spaces.  Very nice.  Ouside patio, when the weather is right, would be lovely for cocktails and food, around a fire pit.    I've eaten here twice.  Once for lunch, once for dinner.  The restaurant clearly is for hotel guests and corporate types.   I live downtown, so tried it despite this.  The food as a whole is decent to good.  It's very hit or miss though.  For example, last night my wife orders the organic salmon.  It was absolutely delicious, cooked perfectly, slightly rare inside and crispy on the outside.  On par with the best fish houses I've ever tried.  For me though, I tried the skirt steak.  It was a $2 piece of meat, barely adequately cooked, drenched in about 100 grams of fat/oil.  I guess to hide the fact that you just got completely scammed into eating a tough, fatty, crappy piece of meat.  I guess I'm more of a filet kind of guy, but honestly, this was one of the worst steaks I've tried.  Deserts were okay.  Appetizers were just okay as well.  Presentation of everything was outstanding, however.  I'd even be back here many times if it was more reasonable in price.  But for the money they are charging, I just demand better food, better service.  Even if the menu is creative, and the setting is one of the nicest modern restaurants I've recently had the pleasure to dine in.  Particularly frustrating since it's only two blocks from my loft.  By all means, if you go here, skip the steak!",

    "text": "Went here with my girlfriend during restaurant week. It was a Sunday evening which may be why the restaurant was mostly empty except for two other couples. The decor is very modern with splashes of color here and there. Nothing that made me say wow but it was nice.  The service was excellent on this day. I'm not sure if it was because of how empty it was but our server was always on top of our refills and getting our dishes out of the way. We happened to make a comment on how it seemed the caeser had too much of a mayo taste and the manager comped our drinks which we did not intend at all. Overall, we felt taken care of without feeling like our server was hovering over us.  We had the flatbread appetizer which was ok but was salty. The chorizo already brought a good flavor to the dish but the chef also added sea salt to the spinach which was overkill. I had the strip steak done medium rare and it came out perfectly. A little on the bland side but it was still very good. My girlfriend had the steak frites. I had a few bites of it and thought it was really good also, however, she was turned off by the bright green color of the chimichurri sauce. The trio dessert was ok, nothing to write home about.  Overall, I think it is a great restaurant to try during restaurant week. I think the regular pricing is a little high for this type of restaurant but it appears to be in line with other restaurants in downtown, especially one connected to a Westin.",

I also loved the shrimp tacos and the meatballs. I think my favorite was the tuna watermelon ceviche. I have never tried anything like it before and thought it was really innovative and unique.  I had to make two trips to the antipasti station, it was really well laid out and the skewers were delicious.   The wines were very good and matched the foods we were served well. The beer was very good also. I also got the privilege of trying the Smart Money drink. It was very good but a little too sweet for my personal tastes.  The staff was extremely courteous and attentive, you could not have asked for a nicer event. My compliments to the chefs, the food was fantastic!   Province gets my highest recommendation, the food and service here are really exceptional. I look forward to bringing friends here to enjoy an exquisite meal.

    "text": "AZ restaurant week kicked off last night and while there are a few established and well liked restaurants that my husband and I have yet to try, we decided to take a gamble and try Province, which was a little less known.  The decor was minimalist, bright, and trendy but reminiscent of other hotel restaurants. I really liked the bar and loved the outdoor seating. When it cools off a little more I could totally see myself enjoying the beautiful patio.   Service was impeccable. Water refilled constantly, napkins refolded. Our server was great. Professional without being too formal. We were checked on several times by the manager.  The amuse bouche was a very tasty and fresh gazpacho. I appreciate that it was vegetarian since I often miss out with amuse bouches.   For starters I ordered the goat cheese fondue and my husband ordered the corn chowder with crab. The goat cheese fondue was good but not impressive. Honestly it was something I could make in my microwave with just a few ingredients. And I wish they had something different to dip into it, like Crostini or something hardier. Instead they had these cracker/flatbread things. A little too salty. My husband's corn chowder was very light and tasty.   For our entrees I ordered the goat cheese tortellini and my husband ordered a steak dish. My goat cheese tortellini was HEAVENLY. Delicate tortellinis with perfectly cooked vegetables in a mouthwatering broth. Absolutely amazing. My husband enjoyed his medium rare steak but said that one side was cooked more than the other. The artichoke gratin that came with the steak was so good that I kept stealing bites.   The dessert was a chef's tasting of 3 desserts, an apple tart, a squash cupcake with maple cream, and a peanut butter chocolate concoction. I am not a big fan of sweets so squash cupcake and peanut butter chocolate thing was way too rich for me but my husband loved it. If you are a dessert fan you will be in heaven here.   The wine pairings were really good for being house wines.   I thought it was interesting because this woman sitting nearby that was obviously there only for restaurant week was complaining to the poor server about portion size. I was sooo full after this 3 course meal.   Our server told us that they have a happy hour that I'm eager to try in their beautiful bar.",

Same for the service.  Our first selection from the menu was not available (according to the server, not available for some time)  Tuna and watermelon - The watermellon pieces were cut from the rhine.  The rhine flavor took over the dish.  Beet & Bleu salad - beets were flavorless, cheese pieces were out of proportion and the salad was overdressed (soggy)  Romaine Hearts Caeser - It consisted of mostly romaine leaf that looked close to the end of its life (browning and not crisp).  Flavor of chile spiked dressing was okay.  Shrimp Tacos - ridiculously small portion; even for tapas.  Shrimp was okay, the tortilla substitiue was not edible.  Fall Squash Gratin - Flavorless.  How do you erode the flavor of fresh squash?  10 Hour Bbq'd Lamb - It was okay at best.  No sign of the advertized chorizo (or even chorizo flavor) to be found.  I did find a few pieces of eggplant but they did not add anything to the dish.  Lamb was very dry.  We sent two plates back  - the beet salad and the squash gratin.  One was taken by the manager and the other by the server.  Neither asked us for any detail about why we did not want the dish - My guess is that they are accustomed to taking dishes back...  Much like the food, service appeared to have the potential to be terrific but in the end was underwhelming.   Our server was distracted and definately uninterested in providing us with a meal on anything other than his own pace.  We are generally quite forgiving about occaisional food quality and service issues.  We are not forgiving of top to bottom failings in food preparation.  I sincerely hope that our experience was a fluke.",

It's located in The Westin and has a beautiful, serene patio/dining area...well, at least until we got there.  The restaurant was empty.  At 7:30 p.m. I was concerned that we weren't going to get in but lo and behold, we had the patio to ourselves.    The service was wonderful, probably due to the fact that we were alone in this place.  Our hostess suggested we sit by the beautiful fire pit and enjoy our cocktails, which we did.  Our sever suggested we order at the pit and that they would come get us when the food was ready to be delivered.  What service.  Food.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it took so long to get our food.  However, it was worth the wait.  I ordered the goat cheese fondue (which is more of a dip), the beet salad and the crab cake.  Others ordered the beef filet, lamb chops and chicken.  Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted superb.  We enjoyed a beautiful evening with a very attentive staff and wonderful food.

    "text": "Last night B and I were looking for a place to eat.  Went to Sens last week, Portland's is a bore, ate at Pita Jungle for lunch and a late night snack earlier in the week... and we didn't feel like hopping on the light rail to go someplace else.  I didn't feel like Hannys tonight.  We decided to go to a fail-safe for us, District.  I really like the food there, but was disappointed when we rolled up on our cruisers (after having called them and asked about this) and found out that their stupid kitchen was closed and we could eat from their sub-par bar menu.  Okay, this isn't about a bad review for District, I do like their food, but they just tick me off... because we called and they said dinner was being served 'til 9:30.  What's up with this town and places closing EARLY?  So we decided to finally try Province Restaurant at The Westin.  I had't read many reviews, but their menu was, as I recollect, \"okay\" sounding.  So we rolled up on Georgia and Dali and didn't know where we could lock our bikes to.  The valet took our bikes and brought them inside... gave us a ticket and we were on our way.    The ambiance was beautiful inside... kinda hotel-ish, but definitely more modern and sleek looking.  I loved that they did their menus intelligently... a few nicely printed pieces of paper on some stock and a fun clipboard.  Little waste.  We were seated and asked for a white wine suggestion... got this really nice light Greek wine, which the name escapes me... but B took a picture on his Droid.    Luis came to our table and brought our wine... telling us how happy he was that we chose this specific bottle.  Very friendly and seemingly knowledgable.  He told us the history of the vines and the grapes... also told us about the region.  Definitely seemed like a Sommelier, or at least trained properly.  I tasted, it was delicious... he told us that he was the general manager.  We ordered a couple of tasty appetizers... some sashimi and a taco of sorts, I forgot what kind of fish was on it, but it was marinated deliciously.  Oh yeah, they brought a yummy li'l amuse bouche.  It seems it's the in thing these days since everyone watches Top Chef and everyone's got an amuse bouche these days.  But it was good... some kind of ceviche tasting item... although I wasn't thrilled with eating raw onions... it wasn't bad.  The wine was flowing and the waitress came back a couple of times to check on us, which was nice.  Our main courses were the pan seared tuna and the bbq lamb.  I made the big mistake of ordering the full portion of the lamb.  You know how you go to fancy restaurants sometimes and their portions are teeny... well I'm not a teeny eater.  So I ordered the full.  Definitely not the wisest of decisions... but VERY delicious nonetheless.  The bbq sauce was a little sweet, but not too much... and the lamb was pulled, which I'd never had before... but inspired me to want to cook lamb in this fashion at home.  B's tuna was very tasty... had an interesting sauce with it that I don't think I've tasted before.  Oh yes, we also ordered some vegetables for the table that were grilled perfectly.  Really tasty stuff there.  Somehow we finished my lamb... and had no dessert.  Next time I'd like to go back and just have some dessert and some cocktails.    Nice place... pretty bar too.  I didn't read any Yelp reviews on this one, but I liked it.  PLUS don't forget the valet service for our bikes.  We went out to get our bikes... tipped the valet and off we went.  Not a cheap dinner, but definitely well worth it, I think.",

You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature.   The food was unbelievable! I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love - what an amazing combination that I'd never have thought of.  If the food isn't enough, the service is superb. Every interaction with the staff was excellent - you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there.   I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible.",

It was our first stop, located right across the street from the light rail and located in the newly built Westin hotel. We were seated quickly and I started with the lagunitas which is dangerous :) We had the goat cheese fondue, tomato flat bread, and albondigas to eat.   The flat bread was very fresh and good, though it was ever so slightly a little greasy. The albondigas, which I was excited to try, unfortunately lacked any spice or \"kick\" so it sort of fell flat. The hit of the table I'd say was the goat cheese fondue. Super good. I would highly recommend it and it was really delicious.   Our server Don was great, and the manager came by and asked how everything was and offered us some coupons for our next visit. I would definitely like to come back for lunch or dinner, or happy hour on the patio.",

I parked closer for me by the corner in a disabled space. The Phoenix police have a new rule for downtown, meters are now until 10 PM even disabled spaces have meters, despicable. The city council has killed night time restaurant business and it shows. When I went out at 8 PM to find a ticket on my auto, my auto was the only one for 3 blocks around. I have spoken to many restaurant managers and they state their business is down since the new 10 PM \"greedy\" meter rule went in to effect. So the city collects less. I'll stay in the Biltmore and N. 7th Street, lots of new exciting restaurants there and no meter hassle.  It's too bad because this restaurant has a great manager, great food and drinks, I rate it a 5 easily but will not be back.",

A little weird but once friends arrived and the night wore on, it got busier. Staff was super friendly and helpful at helping us decide what to try. Ended up trying the following:   Crispy White Corn Croqueta with ancho aioli  Mini Cuban Chicken Sandwich  Summer Squash Taquito  Grilled Tomato Flatbread  Melted Goat Cheese Fondue  Grilled Ahi Tuna Tacos  Potato Frites   The melted goat cheese fondue was great and I really enjoyed the white corn corqueta with ancho aioli. The look was very modern, crisp and clean and a little earthy. Great food, great service, only complaint was the servings were ridiculously small (even for tapas-style it was still small)!! We ordered a lot and I didn't quiet feel full but I didn't want to order any more than we already had because it was adding up!  I would go back again and try some other menu items but now that I know what the serving sides look like, I'll be more particular about what I order.   Also worth noting: They have free parking at the hotel for 2 hours if you validate with the restaurant host!",

From day one - no small feat.  -Stark Japanese flavor to the ambiance: dark wood and stone horizontals massed monochrome walls softened by dessicated organics on surfaces and hanging from the ceiling and a few monochromatic illustrations on one wall.  Pleasing but as a prior reviewer noted, somewhat cold.  We ate at what seemed to be a cork-topped table.  -Amazed at the reasonable prices.  Green lentil soup with a dollop of yogurt, mixed vegetables in sherry, pork belly hash, shrmp over grits and manchego.  All local, all delicious set us back less than $25.  -And the thing that ripped the 5th star off - Starbucks coffee.  With one of the best micro-roasters I've tasted just 2 blocks north at Royal [and a gaggle  of excellent ones within 2 miles nowadays] they couldn't go local with the caffeine roastery?",

I love the music played on Saturday nights on the patio (played by a DJ during the cooler months), but if you want food and/or drinks expect to wait. I don't know where all the servers go, but they always seem to disappear. This past Saturday, I even went and got my own drink at the bar after waiting ten minutes at my table outside on the patio. Let me just say....the bartender was HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! He should find something else because he clearly doesn't want to be there. He was so RUDE!!! Service is big for me and that's why I had to give it two stars. Fire all the wait staff and bartender and get people that know what they are doing.

A little expensive for the portion size. The food was nicely prepared. Tasted fine. Everything is ala cart. If you are hungry or a big eater you will need an appetizer as the portions are a bit on the skimpy side and come without any sides.  The calamari are thick strips as opposed to the traditional rings. They were excellent. The shrimp was nicely prepared and consisted of 6 on a skewer over kimwah. Duck was just 2 small breasts and duck wrapped in skin. It was excellent but skimpy portion.  I would recommend this restaurant.",

Food was okay.  I ordered the breakfast tacos.  And my two companions ordered typical breakfast items that I can't actually remember so that's telling you something about how memorable the food was.  For a typical eggs and breakfast meats meal we had a 60 dollar tab.  Now, I understand that we chose to eat at a hotel restaurant so we should expect premium prices.  However, there wasn't anything premium about the food.    I have always wanted to try Province since it looks like such a pretty place, so I'm glad we can say we tried it.

Where the heck was the rest of the staff, the remainder of the restaurant was empty.  Had the pork shank, which was unusual and tasted good. Nothing spectacular with the favors though.

The server also informed me of their Wednesday wine special where I could get a half-price bottle and take the rest up to your room!

I juice at home and it doesn't take much at all to make a good juice. It tasted like they cut the juice with water to thin it out and make more $$ off of it.

Portions at this restaurant are definitely not big which is fine because I don't like to eat that much.  My roommate and I had dinner here a few nights ago before seeing a show at the Herberger Theater.  We met some of the lucky yelp elites who scored tickets to the Daddy Long Legs performance which, by the way, was enjoyable.  We thought our service was efficient and attentive. We didn't have the same experience as Linda, but we were at another table, so everything seemed to run like clockwork. I don't drink spirits, but they do have a very interesting wine list. The food was also good, and reasonable. I certainly enjoyed the chilled cucumber soup. All of this plus a nice atmosphere makes Province a place worth, returning to time and time again.",

However,  the hostess and the other two servers along with bartenders kept congregating at the corner of the bar, which is where I was sat in main door dining area This disturbed meal and obstructed. my view to bar monitors.   Once the steak came out, it was small in size and the temperature I had ordered- medium, I cut into the steak it was well done. I brought it to the attention of a waitress, she apologized,  offerd to replace it and took it back into the kitchen. When she returned, I did receive a larger steak,  it was the right temperature. This was to my delight and I must admit it was favorable and full of juices. The manager then came over and apologized again and discounted the meal 50 percent, which was great on his behalf.   This is  the reason for my four stars. I then ordered the chilli pepper cheesecake . The first bite was very spicy, but the following bites were complemented by the hibiscus sauce.  To my great surprise, I enjoyed it.  I would recommend this place,  but maybe on a busier day like a weekend, not a non-game event Sunday evening.",

Just grab something to fill teh stomach and time. But I realize my eyes and appetite open my mind at Province.   Here are two specialties I like the most. For breakfast, try Superfood Skillet - [Scrambled egg whites, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, onion & avocado served over sweet potato hash] I haven't seen any skillet is so prepared with wellness in mind. Simple materials cook hot inside but nothing burnt outside. Adding a bit Tabasco, it's my welcoming breakfast for an energetic day to go.  Second recommendation is their Smoothie - [Kale, spinach, banana, mango, and cinnamon] This is really what I call power food that boost your morning drill. Creamy, thick, zesty, and green literally.   Nice vibe in the evening for one or two mixed drinks and some chats with interesting souls.",

That makes it a quiet environment where it's super easy to have a conversation.  I stick to the soup and salad duo at lunch which may be part of the problem. The soup is good but the soup of the day has been the same for two days this week leading me to believe that it's freshness is in question. The salad I tried both times is the beet salad. It's also good but the portion is really small and underwhelming. I left hungry on both occasions.  It is super easy to drive up and valet off central which makes it attractive for a downtown spot but since I'm walking from my office, that's not a consideration.  I'm afraid that I'm taking this one off my lunchtime list.",

The whole place had an ultramodern feel, with smooth Latin music softly playing in the background. We started off with some cocktails and shared their delicious crab cake. We also delved into their cevichi which was good but not super impressive. My main course was salmon which was very savory and not overcooked but I wished it had been served with some rice to compliment the vegetables. For dessert we shared a chocolate cake dish in addition to a strawberry concoction, both paired with a raspberry champagne. The service was impeccable, the wait staff even folded our napkins when we got up to go to the restrooms. Overall I enjoyed my meal, the ambiance was good, but the food was just okay, and in my opinion slightly over-priced. However it was very romantic and I had a great time dining there!",

    "text": "Talk about a disappointment. Restaurant week is something that my close group of friends looks forward to every year. It's a great time to experience something special from a restaurant we have not tried before. Our expectations were high are that the food and service would be impeccable since Restaurant Week is a showcase for creativity. Unfortunately, it was not the case this year. We had a reservation for 10 for Saturday evening. We were promptly seated at a long, comfortable table. However, things went down from there. First off, there were wine substitutions for the meal pairings. The pairing ($10 additional or $5 a glass) was a bargain, but the replacement wines did not match well with the food. The appetizers were a disappointment across the board. I heard negative comments about the ceviche and the corn chowder. I had the goat cheese fondue along with several others (with high praise from the server).  We all commented on its unpleasant, non-fondue-like texture and the tasteless crackers that accompanied it. The entrees fared no better. The salmon was overcooked, the tortellini was bland and the skirt steak was tough and not very favorable as skirt steaks usually are. The worst thing (noted by several others) was an artichoke and leek gratin. It was thick and dry as spackle and the worst item of the night. Nothing came out at the proper temperature. Dessert was an afterthought with a mini sampling of mediocre selections placed on a plate with no flair whatsoever. Though we enjoyed each other's company, we were completely disappointed at this subpar experience. Most said they would not come back based on this experience.",

Everyone enjoyed the food. We spent almost $50 a person, no alcohol. Menu items range from safe haven (steak-frites) to more adventurous. The arepas appear inspired by the Venezuelan variety, would be better with less or no blue cheese. Crab cakes were disappointing, but, then we just got back from Baltimore. If you didn't know what they were, you would not guess they were crab cakes. The chef apparently loves blue cheese more than we did, we all thought it was used a bit much in the menu items and we found the particular selection too strong for our taste.The salmon was good, not anything special. the Feijoada, pushed by te server, was also good. We'll go back to try more of the dishes. Overall the menu seems inspired by Venezuelan-Columbian and other Latin classics but takes a lot of liberties that are interesting, but may stray too far from the original for some of us that love those classics in their native form. We'd definitely go back for another opportunity to try more of the dishes. It is very pleasurable to see real creativity and a bit of culinary risk-taking in downtown Phoenix!",

They were excellent-- interacted with the crowds that came to see them, but the restaurant was what was exciting.  I have eaten at many restaurants and never have I had the level of service I had at Province, inside the Westin.  The manager fixed our table so we could have the best view of the dancers, and interact with them.  Also, they gave us happy hour prices on the wine, because they were a little short staffed when we first arrived, and so we had to wait to order our wine and it was after happy hour.  They had a special event so they had a lot more people there than usual.  The server was attentive.  We both had the fish stew, oh it was good and not too filling, plus we shared a side of polenta and we shared the beef skewer an excellent appetizer to share.  When we finished our meal we were full but not overly so.  The dinner tab was reasonable.  We had the shared appetizer, two glasses of wine each,  the fish stew, and the shared polenta all for $35.00 each, which included the wonderful dancers and the great guitarist.  I would call this place a sleeper, in that it has to be one of the best dinner spots in downtown Phoenix for the price.",

    "text": "Let me say right off the bat that my low-ish rating has nothing to do with the food, which was great.  DH and I both had wonderful meals -- my shrimp and grits was maybe the best I've ever had and the asparagus with preserved lemon was also wonderful.  The portions (one small plate and one \"smaller\" entree) were just right and the prices very reasonable for the quality of the food.  The decor has been commented on and I don't have much to add except that I didn't find it cold -- in fact I really liked it.  The service was generally good EXCEPT . . . and here's the reason for my lower rating:  I am gluten-intolerant and asked our server about several dishes, all of which she advised me to avoid.  When it came to dessert I specifically asked about one item, she said that it had gluten ingredients, so I \"settled\" for ice cream.  Who would ever think (I didn't, but the server should know) that inside this tiny scoop of ice cream was something that was suspiciously like a piece of cookie.  Fortunately my gluten intolerance isn't of the serious, Celiac variety, where I would be very sick for a week from just a taste of something containing gluten, but it's enough that I'll be uncomfortable for a couple of days.  When I told the server what I found, she was very apologetic, someone senior (one of the chefs?) came out and apologized and they took my ice cream off our bill.  They probably should have comped the entire meal (or at least our drinks) but I wimped out and didn't insist.  Just be aware, if you have an issue with gluten, that the servers are not educated about the menu items and you need to insist that they ask the kitchen about any item about which you are not absolutely certain.  It's an issue that has the possibility of being sufficiently serious that they should know about this stuff and, while I can chalk some of it up to opening-week-learning-curve, it's pretty inexcusable.  Without that one issue, it would probably be at least a 4-star, maybe a 5.",

We went in not really knowing if we would stay for dinner; wanted to scope out the menu first.  The menu gave a good appearance and the outdoor patio was more than inviting.  So, we decided to give it a a shot and asked for a table.  Our server, Drew, was off the charts fantastic.  Very professional and was there to make sure our visit was worthwhile.  Our drinks were exceptional and the food was truly fantastic.  The patio with the downtown views really helped to make this place a contender for one of the best venues in our downtown restaurant scene.  It's right on the metro line and easy access to all of downtown  The martinis were a ten, the food including the asparagus salad, the ahi tuna tacos and the pounded chicken breast were all 9+ on a scale of 1 - 10.

We had a party of 6 and they were able to seat us right away, we had mimosas and Bloody Marys... the Marys were good the mimosas were light on the champagne, too much orange juice. We ordered appetizers... chicken skewers, juicy and flavorful, steak bites were very yummy some pieces were a little fatty but it was cooked nicely and the rub was great. The house made potato chips were light and crispy and yummy. The fruit plate was really nice, could've used more yogurt but I probably could have asked for some if it came down to it. The pastry basket was just ok. The corned beef was very very crispy and a little on the salty side so some might prefer it that way, but unless you order it extra crispy I don't think it should automatically come this way. The omelette was okay nothing to write home about, the breakfast potatoes were way overdone they were very very very crispy and tasted of oil. Turkey sausage and egg whites.... How do you mess that up. Here is where the real disappointment was.... The Croque Madame. They have no right calling it that because it is nothing like a croque madame. There's not a shred of Gruyere on the plate nothing has been broiled the bread is soggy and mushy, and the eggs still had a lot of raw white and the bechamel was flavorless and pointless. Do not order this meal there. It is terrible. It is nothing like a croque madame. Province is going to need to step their food game up if they want to survive with the locals.",

Also the cheese got cold quite fast, so something to keep it warm might have been good as well. But overall the experience was great.",

Four for breakfast was $80 and one in my party did not even eat we shared a fruit plate... Definitely not worth the money and since we were the only table in the dining room you would have expected the service staff to be falling over each other to wait on our table... NOT.  Don't think i will be returning and will not recommend to anyone else... Good Luck!",

We ordered coffee (3.5) and I ordered a Bloody Mary  which was a little on the spicy side but tasted fresh and my husband ordered a mimosa ($6 each). We shared the seasonal fruit plate which has a nice variety of fruit  including strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, blueberries, blackberries, and pineapples, but the melon was not ripe and some strawberries were over ripe ($8). I ordered the corned beef benedict ($11) and my husband ordered the classic benedict ($12). The corned beef was a little dry, but I should have expected that! The hollandaise was tart. Best breakfast potatoes I have ever had! We made a reservation per our voucher request but the place was almost empty. I was disappointed that the Westin does not have complementary parking for its guests.",

My husband and I went with another couple and we all got the Retaurant week menu and also opted for the optional wine/cocktail pairing.  Everything was awesome, including the service, though, it had a slow start in the bar.  Not sure what the delay was but it took a while to get someone to come take our order so we coud enjoy some cocktails before dinner.  Once we were seated for dinner, our server Emily took great care of us.  We started with a choice of a cocktail, i enjoyed the mojito and my husband tried the pina colada.  Both were excellent.  Our first course was the roasted plantain and pumpkin soup with a poblano crema; it was delicious!  The next course was the arroz con pollo which again was very tasty.  Next came a wonderfully cooked and seasoned pork chop and tasty yucca black bean cake with a small bed of greens.  And lastly a coconut cream flan with a rum glaze.  (The wine pairings were very good as well.)  This is the third time I have dined at Province and always it is wonderful meal and great service.  Our friends were so pleased (it was their first time) that they are already planning a return trip.  Hope you check out Province for yourself!",

The atmosphere was 4 or 5 star, the valet was prompt and polite, the patio looked like a comfortable place for drinks, and the service was great.

    "text": "I've been here a few times since they opened (i live next door), and have always had amazing food, drink and service....untill (Que Law and Order Theme Music here) last Sunday night. When Alissa (the manager) is there, its a well run machine. Greeted politely, seated immediately, waited on perfectly. Sunday was the first time we went in, and she wasn't there (the on duty front desk mgr ((get to that shortly)) said she had worked the past 10 days in a row and deserved a night off; no question!). We were seated immediately on the wonderful patio, between the water fall and the fire pit. ordered drinks and apps, all came out fast and amazing as always. However, after an hour and 10 minutes of waiting for our main dishes we were beyond livid at our Stoned Out waiter. he seriously must have been in the back playing guitar and yanking on his curly white boy hair. we never saw him and when we did he continued to make excuse after excuse. At one point, he said they were plating our food....43 minutes later we saw him again. Then he blamed \"the 14 top that was just seated\"...um really? they were eating when we walked in; and they were THE ONLY ones in the entire place!!! When we Finlay broke down, and asked for a mgr, he immediately came over (Chris i believe) and asked what was going on. 2 minutes into the conversation, he said \"stop, let me get this handled\" and went to get it handled. our food arrived, along with out POS waiter who didn't say a single word. he just sat our food down, and left, never to be seen again. Chris came back over, and told us our entire meal was comped (all martinis, sodas, apps, entrees', everything!). I understand bad seeds. The only reason I'm still at a 5 star is because of the management, the normal service, and the food is beyond tasty. But, be warned of 2 things: you will pay a premium for the quality (worth every penny to me as long as hippie isn't your Waiter) and 2, if a white boy with curly hair and Cashed eyes is your Waiter, move seats out of his section. If i see him when i go back, my review will drop to 4 stars. Alissa, please smack him around a bit.",

From the moment we sat down, the staff was attentive, but not hoovering.  We were served a little taste, before we even had a chance to look at the menu and then got excited to look at the menu.  Everything from the \"little starter taste\", to the pear salad, to the salmon, (and when everything else is that good, you HAVE to do dessert!)  Our server recommended the stack cake - which was also amazing.    You could be dressed up or casual - either way was okay.  We dined outside to enjoy the balmy evening - Great atmosphere, quiet, did not seem like a \"hotel restaurant\" - can hardly wait for my next trip to Phoenix to dine there again.",

The service was attentive as the restaurant was nearly empty (at 11:45 am), but our server knew next to nothing about the menu items.  He also seemed incapable of making eye contact, which was just odd.  The lentil soup was very good, though the portion was also very small.  I coupled that with a flat bread that was somewhat bland.  My guest had a chopped salad that she had to send back once.  When it came out again, it was fine, but nothing about it stood out.  All in all, it seems like your standard hotel restaurant--eat there if you're stuck in the building, but get out if you're not.",

    "text": "Location:  5 Service:  5 Menu:  4 Environment: 4 Overall:  5  I had breakfast at about 8:00 am on a Wednesday morning.  Province Urban Kitchen & Bar is situated close to public transportation options like the bus or light rail.  There is an enclosed courtyard to welcome you to the hotel grounds.  Look for signs to guide you to the restaurant.  I entered from the east after taking the light rail and found the restaurant without any delays.  Location: 5  I was greeted immediately upon entry.  The host acknowledged me and did not acknowledge my service dog.  This level of professionalism is not common in the year I have lived in the Phoenix metro area.  Most places will pay attention to her and neglect that I am the customer.  I first met Krystle who offered me water and was also the barista that morning.  I asked her to make me her favorite caffeinated beverage.  She brought me a latte with foam so fluffy it reminded me of looking at cumulus clouds.  My server was Christina.  I ordered the Buddha Bowl because of its variety of ingredients and that it was a vegetarian option.  It was delicious and came out promptly.  Service:  5  The menu selection is adequate.  I was able to review it online before I got there and had in mind what I wanted.  The menu is built for those who have a focused breakfast appetite and may want to eat and run.  The price may be appropriate for the alignment to a hotel like WestIn, I found it a slightly high for the portion size and presentation of my dish.  Menu:  4  The environment was inviting.  There is a HUGE picture of the Phoenix light rail train on the eastern wall.  The rest of the interior design felt canned and missed an opportunity to include local art to create a more unique feel to the restaurant.  There is appropriate space between the tables so that you are not bumping into others as you are seated or leaving.  Environment:  4  Overall:  Province is a place to stop by and check out.  Whether you are living and working downtown or passing through while you visit this city, I recommend you visit this restaurant.  This place is for those wanting a change in standard fare and environment who can dine in or order to go.  And try out the Buddha Bowl, I think you'll like it!",

I don't normally order signature cocktails because I don't like sweet and too many flavors to confuse my taste buds, but the balance was incredible! Last but absolutely not least, my server Karen was wonderful. She made sure everything was great, my courses were timed perfectly and gave the customer attention needed without being overbearing, as I have experienced at so many other restaurants. Definitely ask for her if you try this establishment for the first time (or any time!). Dinner will go smooth and you'll leave with a smile on your face. I sure did!

    "text": "Province is located inside the Westin Phoenix Downtown hotel. I had two meals at Province - lunch the first day and breakfast the second day.  For lunch I sat at the bar and I ordered a spicy tomato soup and the W.P.D. Cobb Salad - which included: Avocado, applewood bacon, cucumber, egg, tomato, blue cheese, house-made ranch dressing, and sliced grilled chicken. The soup was outstanding! I could have drank a gallon of it! The salad was solid - nothing special.  Lunch was greatly marred by the fact that the fire alarm system went off when it was not supposed to. Apparently they were testing the system elsewhere in the hotel - but it went off downstairs. It went on and on and on - until I had a throbbing headache. I was about to get up and walk out - but just then they finally turned it off.  I ended up having to go down some Tylenol with an iced coffee to get rid of the headache. Nice going Westin hotel staff.  The next morning for breakfast - I decided to try the Corned Beef Hash - which features House-made corned beef, poached eggs, topped with a grained mustard hollandaise. Plus coffee, water, and V-8 juice. It was outstanding! Delicious! Yummy!  Service was good.",

That being said, not for those who like simple soul food. The portions are smaller but the complex flavors were more than enough for me to feel satiated.",

First was to have a wonderful peanut butter stout. Next was to have dinner: cauliflower croquettes, beef cheek on blue corn polenta, and pork three ways. Outstanding! Third time was for lunch: Sonoran Caesar Salad. Not as special as it sounds, but they did bring me extra dressing (which was needed). Fourth was to use my drink ticket for a Holiday in Jerez - fantastic! Fifth was for breakfast - the green chili pork chilaquiles, very nice. All the foods I had featured a little tip of the hat to the regional flavors, especially pepper and corn. Do yourself a favor and spare some time away from the convention go-to pubs to check this place out.",

    "text": "Arriving for dinner at 6:30pm on a Sunday evening, I was a little bit nervous when I walked in because the dining room was empty... except for 3-4 tables with people dining alone.   Then it hit me, it was the restaurant for the Westin, so it made a little more sense.  The dining room was beautiful and \"loungy\"... had an upscale 60's Vegas vibe.     I was a bit disappointed that the lighting wasn't more dim to make it a more elegant dining experience, but the rest of the evening made up for it.  Our server was beyond friendly and delightful.  She was very attentive, but not overbearing.     The wine selection was quite nice... I didn't look at the cocktail menu specifically, but it seemed as though they had a nice variety.  We ordered the meat/cheese plate as an appetizer and it was perfect for two people.     For dinner, I had the 6oz filet and it was cooked beautifully as medium.  Crispy onions on top with beautiful fingerling potatoes and mushrooms.   My friend was able to have hers the way it was intended, with roasted tomatoes, which probably added to the flavor, but my tomato allergy restricted that for me.   All and all it was a very tasty dish.  We shared a beautiful pot de creme for dessert and it was something that we agreed we both would have had our own because it was that good!  I imagine it's hard for a restaurant to survive in downtown Phoenix, but also being part of a hotel, makes it harder to fill up, but.............   It would be a great option if you're going to a show or the theater downtown!  Also, they had a beautiful outdoor patio, which I would have loved if it weren't into the low 50's by the time I arrived.   It's hard to see from the street - the signage isn't obvious, but if you take advantage of the Westin parking lot/valet service, Province will validate your ticket!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. I had initially seen this place on groupon then read reviews and the menu and was excited to try it. Its a type of atmosphere I like in a restaurant, very modern, and nicely appointed. This ended up being one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. I'm generally pretty easy to please and very forgiving of little issues of a restaurant. This place missed on just about every aspect.  We went at about 4:30 for a late lunch and happy hour. We sat in the lounge and greeted fairly promptly. Drink orders were taken. A little stingy on the pours of their wine. The Sangria, both red and white were tasty. The red Sangria had quite the kick. That was the best part of the evening. After asking for one more minute to browse the menu before ordering our server vanished. It was nearly 20 minutes before having to step up to the bar to ask to order food. We ordered a mix of items as I love to try lots of items from a new place. We ordered the burger, 2 different tacos, crab croquettes, and the meatballs. Most of which are small plate items. The tacos are very small and do not come on a white corn tortilla. I'm not quite sure what it was. I was not a fan. I hardly noticed that their was shrimp in the one taco. I only noticed from looking, it was not from tasting it. The skirt steak in the second taco was tender and flavorful. The crab croquettes and typical of bar food. You could taste the crab, not in a sweet Maryland style crab cake kind of way. It was more like a tuna fish casserole sort of taste. The burger was decent, but definitely not worthy of a $12 price tag. I have had larger Wagyu beef hamburgers for the same price that tasted so much better. The fries with the burger are good and the house made ketchup is great. The last item of what we ordered was the meatballs. Its a cute presentation with triangles of toast for dipping in the bland sauce. Unfortunately the meatballs were uncooked in the center. Not just undercooked and pink, they were RAW on the inside. I sent the dish back of course. The waitress was very apologetic and took them off the bill. As she was trying to clear the table she dropped some silverware and food at our feet. By this time she obviously was not having a good day. She brought us a complimentary dessert of a pumpkin cupcake with ice cream. The ice cream was great. The cupcake was overcooked and dry. When the bill arrived I gave my groupon and credit card to the server. The manager came back with both and apologized for bad experience and comped the whole bill. I'm not sure if I would try them again. The problems with the meal were very basic things that just should never happen at a restaurant of this level.",

Not currently on the menu, but worth ordering is their seafood paella, with a delicious sauce featuring just a hint of coffee.  I know it sounds a bit odd, but it really works.  We've also had the empanadas and the meatballs (served in the cutest little Staub casserole).   I'm especially fond of their desserts, including the Honey Crisp stack served with Dulce de Leche ice cream and the spectacular coffee and donuts, warm little donut holes sprinkled liberally with cinnamon and sugar and served with a coffee ice cream and dark chocolate ganache ~ absolutely heavenly.  Although this is a very generous portion, if you have any dedicated chocoholics or coffee addicts in your party, you may need to order one per person, it's really that good! Lovely outdoor patio and charming staff make this one of our favorite places.",

The hostess was really nice and let us pick any table we wanted outside. There was only one other party outside but sitting near the waterfall did make it feel a bit cooler. Our waitress arrived shortly and we ordered the caramelized banana split for $8. When it arrived a short time later, its presentation was fairly fancy with one banana, split in half, caramelized (read: slightly burnt but in a good way) and one scoop of vanilla ice cream and everything covered in peanuts. While it was good, for $8 it seems like it should have been a lot more considering all those ingredients combined probably cost $1. Would it have broke the bank for two scoops? Oh well, it hit the spot and we got to enjoy the neat little patio.",

We had almost the exact meal as the previous reviewer so I wont bother telling you how wonderful and tasty the meal was so instead I'll tell you how accommodating the wait staff was. My wife is at the end of her 1st tri-mester and eating is something that can go any direction. Half way through dinner she felt full and didn't want to eat anymore because she wanted to try dessert. Dessert took a little while to come out but when it arrived my wife couldn't even eat a bite she started feeling quite ill and on the verge of crying I called over our waitress and explained the situation and asked if the dessert plate could be wrapped up. She was amazing and told us no problem and then came back a few minutes later with the sweet snacks.   Great evening.",

If we were not famished we would have looked for another place, but the valet had already parked us.  Complimentary valet service was nice. I ordered a vegetarian black bean burger. It came with fries, but I substituted for fruit. The fruit bowl was huge, but the fruit was day-old melon.  My friend had a boring chicken sandwich. Grilled and tossed across a bun..just blah.  We were confused on wait staff-who was serving us? Three people came by. They were confused with fetching a little ketchup for me to try and spice up the bean burger.  The bean burger was dry and arrived with no sauce or toppings except lettuce and tomato.  We ate just to eat,  tipped and were left with a feeling..nice place for a nice drink and a chat if you are near The Westin, but other than that...prepare to be bored.",

The waiter I had was extremely courteous and helpful, making it an overall fantastic experience.  Instead of starting with apps, I decided to try small portions of the Pan Seared Rare Hawaiian Tuna and the House made Papardelle Pasta (I love the fact that they have small / big portions for some of their entrees!). The tuna was delicious. It had the right amount of lemony zest and the romesco sauce was outstanding. this is def one of my favorite dishes.   The pasta was fresh and tasty. I loved the mix of mushrooms and monchego.  Having been to quite  a few of the restaurants in phoenix, i will say that province is right up there with the best!",

    "text": "Province, at the Westin Phoenix is a pretty standard American menu, with some very interesting Spanish twists, and a somewhat awkward dining room. We dined for lunch and had a roller coaster ride of a meal. Our server answered many questions with \"I don't know\" and never offered to find the answer, so we were left with nothing to go on. His stumbles through his pre ordering \"speech,\" which sounded like he was reading from a script, were pathetic. Not his fault if they make him recite something verbatim, but I don't want to eat at a place where the servers are doing that, there is no connection whatsoever.   We tried the flatbread with Chorizo and Manchego which was fantastic, the papperdelle which was great as well, and even the squash sandwich, which was probably my favorite. Per the servers recommendation, I tried the \"out of this world\" hamburger. It certainly was not \"out of this world\" as he so proclaimed. Actually, it was pathetic. The nuked piece of meat, lack of ANY sort of condiment, and only a leaf of lettuce and a slice of tomato made this a dry as a piece of cardboard abortion of a burger. Upon telling our server, he said \"oh yeah, we have a cook who likes to cook things a little longer.\" That's not an acceptable answer, dude... and if the guy is that bad at cooking, then he needs to be taught to cook to a standard. A side note here, we light salt, but found everything to be completely doused in salt, almost to the point where it was overwhelming. Regarding this, our server did tell us a cook in the kitchen is heavy handed. Dude why are you guys not training these people? And why are you throwing your co workers under the bus?  I'll go back here after a while when they can work out some kinks. As for the atmosphere though, it's a big empty room, with nothing interesting inside. They have some corporate'y \"art\" on the walls that looks uninteresting, and a huge open space in the middle of the dining room that desparately needs something done with it.",

Province is inside The Westin, and since I was already staying the night, I decided to pop on in to province during happy hour to give them a try.  After checking out the happy hour menu I went with the cocktail of the day ($7), which was a watermelon mojito. If you were to imagine a perfect beautiful summer day, this cocktail would match that feeling, it was cool and refreshing and had a little kick it to and for $7 bucks, I had 2!  For the bites, I ordered the poutine, which during happy hour is a bangin good deal ($6). It was thick cut fries, gravy, chorizo, cotija and roasted green chili, these were amazing! So dang good! Almost licked the pan clean haha.  If you are looking for a great chill place for happy hour, go give province a try!",

OK, my thoughts:  They have valet parking, but, trust me, plan to pay $12, cause you will definitely go over your free first 3 hours.  No big deal, and the parkers are nice guys. Now the food, I had the steak for $36 which is a petite filet mignon over something I couldn't identify along with a reddish-orange sauce.  Good, filling and probably the best thing there as both the receptionist and waitress suggested it. My son had the swordfish which he said was good, but it looked more like a patty of swordfish to me.  Regardless, he said it was good just not great. Conclusion:  Get the petite filet mignon. Not a fantastic meal--but a good, filling one cooked very well--so, we wouldn't hesitate to go there again. Service was great, too.  We called and told them we were heading to the opera, so couldn't handle the meal being too late.  They did exactly what we asked.  No complaints at all with the service. Word of caution:  If you go to Province before a show like we were, make a reservation.  The place was packed!  Latecomers were stuck eating on those high chairs at the bar--not comfy looking to me.",

We had a reservation, so we were seated right away.   We ended up being 7 people instead of 6 and it was no big deal, another chair was added to the table and orders were taken. I ordered the chicken flautas , which are a re-imagined version of traditional chicken flautas. They use blue corn, which was an exciting change. the flautas were packed with  chicken, which seemed a bit un-seasoned, and came on top of lettuce (traditionally the lettuce is on top) . On top of the flautas there was a creamy avocado sauce  thing, which I thought was good but felt paltry , would have been great to have more sauce on the side.  The flautas come with a side, and I ordered sweet potato fries, which is a weird combination with flautas, but they were pretty great and I regret nothing.  Overall I enjoyed my experience and I applaud the creativity of the chef to re-invent a traditional dish. I would be interested to try more of their menu items.",

    "text": "It was my birthday weekend. I tend to not want a big fuss on my birthday, but other people usually have other ideas. I usually surrender, as it is a great opportunity for me to get together with the 5 most amazing women in my life (my wife and my 4 daughters).  My daughters had heard great things about this particular restaurant, located within the Westin Hotel, on the corner of Central Avenue and Van Buren. So, they wanted us to go have Sunday Brunch to celebrate my birthday.  It was a quiet Sunday morning at Province. I counted two groups seated at the patio, and no one was in the main dining room. There were two gentlemen seated at the bar, but they weren' eating.  We had a two-hour window for Brunch, as I had tickets to the Cardinals game all the way across town. We were seated promptly at 11 AM. Sadly, after that, our issues began.  Although we were given our menus immediately, and our drink orders were taken, it took close to 20 minutes for our server to actually bring our drinks. Then, it was ultimately close to 45 minutes before our food actually arrived.   Our server apologized profusely for the delays, in between her harried tasks of taking care of the tables at the patio, and a couple who now was seated behind us in the main dining room. We were understanding, but we all thought that perhaps they were short handed as our server seemed to have been taking care of all the tables.   Don't get me wrong, the food was fantastic. All our meals were cooked to perfection. My Steak and Eggs was wonderfully prepared. The grilled steak was cooked to my liking - medium well, and well marinated. The potato hash that came with the dish was tender inside but also had a  crunchy exterior. The Pancakes had amazingly flavorful blueberries. We also ordered the Sonoran Eggs Benedict, which had a delightfully spicy chorizo as part of its ingredients. It really did come alive within our palates. Yes, we do share food amongst each other as most families do. It's just an efficient way to sample the variety of dishes.  However, by the time we got out of there, it was past 1 PM, and I wound up being late for the start of the football game.  I'm really not sure what happened there that morning. But, it didn't leave a good impression with any of us. My daughters voiced their regret about deciding on this spot. I allayed their concern, stating that it was more important for us to get together once in a while; than it is for us to be flustered by lapses in service at an establishment such as this.  It's unfortunate because upon reviewing the recent reviews, it appears that my review may be one of the few 3-star reviews or less, of late.",

On my first visit, I think my vegan options were the standard \"fries and a salad\" but I got sweet potato fries instead. The server suggested he bring me a side of maple syrup for the fries. I raise an eyebrow, but once I tried it, I was an addict.   On my most recent visit, my friend and I needed a quiet place to chat, drink tons of coffee and have a light snack in the mid-morning. The restaurant was quiet and comfortable, and the coffee was delicious. They even had soy milk! My friend got the mixed fruit and berries, which were beautiful, and I ordered a side of hash browns cooked well done. A few minutes after ordering, a person who seemed to be a manager came out and said they only have a \"house potato trio\" and asked if that would be okay. I thought that was sweet and let her know any kind of crispy salty potatoes were fine by me! The potatoes were perfect and the fruit and berries were gorgeous.  We never saw the bottom of our coffee mugs, and before we left, the manager/server came back and offered us some \"cold beverages to go\" so we got two iced teas! Needless to say, we got the caffeine fix we needed, and then some!",

They were a bit on the pricey side for the size but she did note that the champagne was plenty and the juice was just for color.

It was a good time since we were going for a celebration but I don't know that I could go there on the regular.  It was a bit expensive.

We selected a booth in the bar area and were \"well\" served by the bar tender. My wife ordered a Sonoma Cutrer Chardonnay and I asked for a glass of Bordeaux. They were both very drinkable, in fact, I ended up ordering a second round for myself. Then we selected several small plates. These included cauliflower croquettes, filet & NY tips, fried green tomatoes, salmon cakes and a watermelon salad.    We cleaned our plates - everything was tasty and fresh. I was surprised to find that the cauliflower was my favorite. I would definitely order this again.  Prices were competitive, service was very good and the food (based on what we tried) was delicious.

I created my own flight of 5 beers ($12) to go along with my dinner - scallops on a bed of potatoes, corn, bacon and some veggies ($33). The food was good, but didn't stand out in particular. I did enjoy sitting outside in the courtyard, next to the fire pit. Do come in if you're not feeling like going out of the hotel - it's a good option. Otherwise, go explore Phoenix!",

The ambiance is modern and a touch of elegance at the same time comfortable for my liking.  The menu selection it seems a small one, but they are of good selection. To start with I have ordered their beef cheeks, the beef meat was tender literally melts on your mouth the corn puree garnishing was appetizing and light, I was going to scrape the last of it if I was not thinking of how good my main dinner dish would be. So as I have pictured the Pan Roasted Sea Bass on this review, the presentation was very attractive the black rice and the Marvin's romesco sauce was a perfect match to the delightful pan roasted Sea Bass and black forbidden rice.  I could not dare to choose on their array of wine selection so I went with my usual 'Cosmo' martini.... all time fav.  My server Tyler was a very accommodating, cute young lady, she had excellent customer service, very helpful and informative of my dinner selection, my compliments to the young men named Adrian who made sure I have a full glass cold iced water the whole entire dinner time.  With that said, it's a wonderful dinner experience.  I will for sure recommend to business peers, friends and family alike.",

The eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise was velvety & delish. The hubs breakfast were some pillowy slightly chewy waffles served with warm syrup. We both really enjoyed the breakfasts.  Fast forward to our cocktail service this year in the bar for NYE. It was busy, busy full of Fiesta Bowl fans, locals & Suns fans cruising in for a cocktail before heading out for the night. There was a little live entertainment & table service in the bar area. The only bummer is the beautiful outdoor patio that normally has table service didn't because of how busy it was. The nice thing was the hostess let us know that ahead of time so we weren't disappointed.",

    "text": "Visited Province Urban Kitchen & Bar for breakfast during a trip to Phoenix.  It is located in the Westin, which is also really close to the Convention Center, Talking Resort Arena, and Chase Stadium.  The restaurant has a nice and clean decor with a bar in the middle.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with mushroom, spinach and tomatoes along with potatoes.  It also came with toast, and I chose wheat bread.  However, it took at least 20 minutes for the food to come out.  I also noticed that alot of other tables were taking awhile to get their food to come out as well.  I finally got my food and asked for ketchup and tabasco sauce to go along with it.  It took another 15 minutes to get my condiments and had to remind my waiter about my request.  I had already eaten half my dish by the time my condiments came.  As for the dish itself, the eggs were very dry and the potatoes were really salty.  The toast was good and came with a peach marmalade.  Maybe it was just that day, or maybe it's just breakfast time; but I wasn't impressed by the slow service, dried scrambled eggs and salty potatoes",

I ordered the eggs your way, I did scrambled eggs with the best bacon and the potatoes were sooo good. It also came with 4 pieces of toast with the absolute best blueberry compote !!  My friend got the pancakes of the month which were blueberry. The pancakes were really buttery and melted in your mouth. Although it is a little pricey compared to other places it is worth it! You can taste the quality and the location itself is very cute.",

First tried the salmon ceviche at Devoured, and as I'm a picky salmon eater, the fact that I enjoyed it was a good sign...the fact that they then handed me a 20.00 off coupon was a very good sign.  Used said 20.00 coupon yesterday. Overall a good experience. Love that they bring you out a semi amuse bouche that features some of the fresh ingredients the kitchen is working with that day. Ours was a chopped vegetable medley and it was very fresh and well seasoned. Started with the goat cheese fondue on the recommendation of both our server and fellow yelpers. Very good. Also, the bread service was tasty...non-traditional and yet very enjoyable.  My dad had the pounded chicken breast, which was good....but could have used a little more veggies (for a farm to table restaurant). my salad was also tasty.   My tortilla soup, however, was a totally different story. Awful. Terrible. Inedible. Blander than bland...so spice at all, it didn't even taste like there was any salt or pepper. I couldn't eat it. So minus 2 stars for the sad, sad, sad soup  Added back .5 stars for 1) being downtown and 2) giving me a 20.00 coupon and 3) being pretty new (hopefully someone can season up that soup)  Additionally the bar, which I didnt get to experience, looks like a great place to grab a pre-show beverage.",

    "text": "Me and my daughter went here for Thanksgiving dinner. It says in the restaurant description, not good for kids, but my 8 year old fit in fine. Maybe that's b/c it was a holiday.  The atmosphere is modern, trendy, colorful and just beautiful overall. The patio is as nice as the inside dining area.  We were able to easily make a reservation on Open Table for the same day. The Thanksgiving menu was very reasonably priced ($26 per person,) the valet parking was free and the hostess knew my name and when we walked in - probably b/c they read the comments section from Open Table in which I noted it would be me and my 8 year old daughter coming in for dinner! Nice touch.     On to the food; it was largely traditional with the gourmet twists you would expect. Everything was served family style, and it came with a salad and dessert. My favorites were the turkey, maple sweet potatoes, chorizo stuffing, gravy, dessert and mashed potatoes. The not so good was the bland salad and the brown butter Brussel sprouts, which were really undercooked.  While the atmosphere and staff were impeccable, the wait for our dinner was extraordinarily long. We waited about 45 minutes between when our salads arrived and our dinner arrived. Luckily, the ambiance and iPad photos distracted us. When I got the check, I noticed they only charged me $12 for my daughter, which was a pleasant surprise. I fully expected the pay $26 per person, as advertised.  In summary, I will definitely go back, try their normal menu and hang out with friends. I just hope the service is faster next time!",

It's my wife's favorite place to go get breakfast at downtown, and I've recently began coming for a nice steak under $40. They have a short but balanced menu that ranges from small plates like Scallop Ceviche to a NY Strip steak for around $32! They have a decent by the glass wine menu, some local beers and cocktails. I typicaly stick to a glass of red wine with my steak, but decided to have a beer with my dinner this evening. i got teh NY strip steak with leek gratin and abodada sauce and wilted spinach. It's a HUGE strip steak, and aggressively seasoned (the way it SHOULD be). My wife got the goat cheese fondue, teh scallop ceviche and we got some croquettes that were awesome! With my daughter's cheese pizza, drink, tax and tips, our meail was just under $100 (1/3 of that being my steak dinner haha). Over all a great place to get a good meal with great service. They also have a VERY nice patio that's perfect for this time of the year!",

Province had a special menu for the Yelpers.  We were given 20% discount off of the menu.  The fondue with pretzel crisps and garlic cheese ball appetizers (not too sure what it was), but pretty delish!  As for main meal, I had the grilled shrimp taco. You get two mini tacos filled ancho chile aioli and shrimps.  I was unable to squeeze any juice from grilled lime.  Maybe I was hungry and weak.  One of my corn tortillas sort of fell apart when I picked it up, but, they were still good.   Unfortunately, the main meals arrived quite late, so most of us were rushing to eat before the show starts.  I felt really bad for Jami that didn't even have a chance to eat her meal. She had given us the show tickets, but had to leave to the theater.  A big thank you to Lindsey for the appetizers, coordinating this CMYE, and Jami with ATC for show tickets!   One slow night will not keep me away; however I hope the next visit will have a quicker food service.",

The salmon was actually really good, but the chicken was lacking in flavor. The dessert sampler was a big flop -- so pretty, but they tasted like they had been sitting out for days -- old and chewy. But I can say the service by our waitress was outstanding -- she was so nice! Afterward, at the bar, the older, male bartender couldn't have been any less interested in serving anyone.

Another great bite was the shrimp taco and the churros, darn they were good, I had I think 4 of them.  The drinks were flowing, I had red and white sangria, both delicious.  I was one of the lucky ones who was able to learn how to make their \"smart money\" cocktail. A mix between a manhattan and a mint julep.  It was so much fun.

They made for great company for the evening. :) I liked how everything was set up in little tasting stations, and they also came around to the tables with samples of what was being served as well. My personal favorites tonight were the Chicken Tortilla soup, the meatballs, and the churros dipped in chocolate ganache. The white sangria was also delicious! The outdoor space at Province seemed very warm and cozy with the fire feature and the high top tables. I also liked the industrial modern feel of the metal building with the artsy colored lighting. I would definitely come back to Province some time!",

The bar inside is definitely more crowded and loud. The food was pretty good, they have an interesting menu of south american food.   I had the stuffed peppers and the spiced scallops which was the perfect amount of food for dinner. It was also accompanied by the mixed red wine which was pretty fantastic. The second night I ate there, I had the spiked caesar salad. It was pretty good, but I was still hungry after, I should have added one more tapa. If I find myself at the Westin again, I will definitely be having dinner at Province.",

    "text": "DEFINITELY NOT SPECIAL OCCASION  Ok, I really wanted to give this place three stars because after all even though it was definitely the wrong pick to celebrate an anniversary I wanted to be objective and review the food/prices/atmosphere. Unfortunately, I can't give it more than two stars.  We picked this place after a long search for a nice place to celebrate a special anniversary and were pretty disappointed with the atmosphere. It's very cold, business-like, modern, not romantic AT ALL. It would be good for a business lunch or a dinner if you are from out of town with your coworkers but not good for special occasions. But again not really their fault.   Now the most disappointing thing was prices vs service. The food was actually pretty good. We got Havana Flat Bread for an appetizer and my husband got Seafood Arroz Amarillo which was tasty and I got Bass with lobster mashed potatoes. My fish was excellent, and the potatoes had real lobster pieces in it (not just the taste like some places). The fire roasted peppers were a little disappointing because I thought they would be on the side but it turned out to be a pathetic little teaspoon full pile on top of the fish. But that's ok, overall the food was really good.   However, for that kind of money ($130 check) the service was lacking. The waitress was polite but seemed like she didn't really give a damn and what killed it was coffee/dessert. We ordered coffee/desert and they arrived 10 minutes apart. Really? I might not be like most people but I prefer my desert to arrive with the coffee. And they were not busy at all! So I would pay maybe $60-$70 for this dinner experience but definitely not $130! Will not go back. There are plenty of places that are cheaper/better service.",

    "text": "$16 for one white sangria?  Yep, that's what I paid.  Was it right?  No, but due to time constraints caused by the staff who were unable to efficiently accommodate our large group despite ample notice we were coming, I had to forgo the inquiry.  So much for our 20% discount.  With my main complaints out of the way, I can say that I did like the clean and modern space.  Although we sat inside, they have a beautiful patio as well.  My husband and I had soup ($7) and shared several small plates ($8-$12 each).  The tortilla soup with avocado and roasted chicken was wonderfully spicy and full of flavor.  I was a little surprised by the small portion given the pricing, but it was spicy enough to be plenty.  The crab cake with chipotle remoulade was really nice, too.  I had the shrimp tacos to myself.  Although the shrimp was cooked perfectly, the tortillas did not hold up.  One disintegrated a bite into it requiring the use of my fork.  My husband also ordered the meatballs.  I tried one, and while they were tasty, I could do without.  While I would be inclined to return for a cocktail or an appetizer, I would be hesitant to have dinner before a show or with a group again due to the extremely slow service in both getting our food and the checks.",

Our kids ordered from the kids menu, but did not like the pasta with red sauce or buttered sauce.   The seasonings were just not to their liking.  It's kind of like giving gourmet mac and cheese to a kid that is used to Kraft Mac and Cheese...it just won't work.  :)  We expected this but got them their own entrees just for the experience/ambience anyway.  The host, however, was apologetic that the kids didn't eat their food and offered to get us chicken nuggets or something else off the menu, but we declined.  THerefore, instead he bought my wife and me some more alcoholic drinks.  I might add that the drinks he bought us had more kick than the same ones we had ordered earlier in the evening.  :)  The service and ambience were excellent.  They also had flamenco dancing on the patio which made the experience more fun for all of us.    The food was pricey, but we would consider returning for drinks and some tapas for a late night snack.",

I met other yelpers here for pre-theater dinner. I will say there were about 20+ of us give or take at various tables. At the larger table of about 12, for some reason they just couldn't seem to get it together. Drink orders got mixed up, food orders came out very late or not all. Yes you read that right, not at all.  It got to the point that we were scrambling to eat the food some of us did receive and pay our bill to get out of there to catch the show. The table across from us, the entire party came in later than we did ( table of 6) and yet they were served there drinks, food, and checks in a very timely fashion. (and yes they were part of our group)  I will say this, the food that we did receive was good and the staff was friendly enough but still it does not make up for the service. The restaurant was not busy and we had reservations so it was not like they didn't know we were coming  which makes this even more puzzling. Maybe I will try again if and when I am downtown and just sit at the bar. Maybe it was the fact that we were a large party, but again the restaurant was not busy. Maybe they were just having an off night.",

    "text": "Pros: + Design inside the restaurant + Patio: fire pit, water wall, umbrellas, heaters + Brunch served 'til 4pm on weekends  Cons - Coffee is badbadbad - Inconsistent food quality - Super pulpy mimosas (maybe a 'pro' for pulp lovers? Their opinions don't count though; who likes pulp?)  Getting out of bed after most places had stopped serving brunch two days in a row led to two consecutive brunches at Province last weekend. Which was good because now I know that it wasn't just one off day they had on Saturday, but that it's a genuinely mediocre brunch option.  Coffee that was served was cold the first visit, burnt and bitter the second. Being poured the bottom of the pitcher led to grounds floating in my mug. Whatev, it happens. But the server not saying anything--or fixing it--was disappointing.  Mushroom/goat cheese omelet was fine. Actually, pretty good. Dressing on the side salad was great & the tomatoes were super fresh (salad was better than the omelet). Benedict on visit 2 was really, really disappointing. English Muffins used as the base were great but that's where the positives end. The sauce was too thick, had very little flavor and there was way too much of it.   Over-cooked poached eggs really piss me off. As a cook or a server it's painfully obvious when eggs are overdone. No jiggle? Don't serve them. Sadly, two completely solid eggs were put on my plate. Cut into them, took the solid top off like a lid to show the completely solid center and pushed them aside on the plate. Again, server said nothing.  He got the pancakes on visit #1 and chorizo tacos on #2. Plate was cleaned both times, so they couldn't have been that bad. It's possible I'd go back, but only on a beautiful day to enjoy the patio and possibly try the mini churros.",

The server's presentation of the food builds your expectations...  But.  The food shatters the image.  We ordered a main dish, the goat cheese tortellini as an appetizer to share.  Good thing we didn't expect to fill up on this sad serving of 3 limp, lifeless blobs.  It was evident that the pasta was fresh but the flavor and texture were lacking.  And, I am being gentle. From there, we were scared to adventure in to other creative dishes so we stayed \"safe\" with the burger and fries.  Ordered medium, the hockey puck came out well-done with soggy fries to match.  Aye. My wife made me send it back threatening a better meal at the Burger King.  We rarely complain but we asked the server for a new burger, he obliged, graciously.  He served us some complementary bread items which were nice and fresh.  The new burger and fries arrived shortly and were upgraded from an F to a C+, at best.  We were happy with the option for small or large pours of wine.  I really want Province to pull it together because it has great potential.  On a previous occasion, I enjoyed a burger, fries and margarita over happy hour in the bar.  I will be back because I remain hopeful for you, Province.",

The salad was 100% iceberg drowned in dressing which added mediocre flavor at best.  I've had better salads by buying pre-made bags from the grocery store.  My main dish, a 16oz steak was overcooked and while palatable, in no way merited its hefty price.

    "text": "What a posh and delectable evening this was, hosted by Province's GM Luis San Martin, and our CM Lindsey!  Luis' passion for food, combined with executive Chef Zweiban's history in the Latino American culinary community, have combined to make Province a truly unique gastronomic experience.  Province's focus on using locally grown ingredients in their cooking and creating contemporary American dishes infused with Latin fare - creates a seasonal menu experience, and only enhances their appeal.  We had the ultimate pleasure of sampling many of their wonderful offerings this evening.  The evening began with their White and Red sangrias, concocted with Orange liqueur and Spanish brandy.  The red had a full and bold taste, making for an excellent sangria! Apple slices gave it a great fall flavor.  My first course was the Beet and Bleu Cheese Salad.  With candied marcona almonds and an apple cider vinaigrette, the many flavors and buttery beets made this a perfect starter for the night.  (I loved it so much I ordered it to go, at the bar, later that evening)  This was followed by the Heirloom tomato with house made mozzarella salad, doused in a cilantro almond dressing which added a unique twist to this popular salad.  Soups came next, featuring a Butternut Squash Soup with toasted pepitas and a Tortilla Soup with rotisserie roasted chicken and avocado.  I was not a fan of the tortilla soup, as it had a smoked chipotle flavor, but the butternut was creamy and full of flavor.    Passed hors d'oeuvres came out about every 5-10 minutes, and I was overwhelmed at the artfully crafted bites that we got to sample.  The mushroom croquettas, stuffed with a potato puree and served with a garlic aoli were outstanding.  The Mini Cuban pork on brioche sandwich, with mustard aoli and cabbage slaw a beautiful amalgam.  Then came the Tuna and Watermelon ceviche with a spicy rice wine vinaigrette that gave the perfect kick to the mellow flavor of the tuna and sweet texture of the watermelon.  One table had an assortment of charcuterie ranging from Serrano ham, to Manchego cheese, to Spanish olives.  There were also three distinctive samplings of their main courses.  The Ancho chile rubbed skirt steak with a touch of chorizo was ambrosial!  For skirt steak, the meat was supremely tender, having been marinated.  What great southwestern flavor!  This was followed by the Pounded Natural Chicken Breast, in an orange mojo sauce.  Great combination of flavors! Last but not least, I feasted on the Slow Braised Brandt Farms Meatballs, served with a unique piquillo-ancho sauce, which tasted of a very rich marinara, but with a slight smokey flavor.  The culinary experience continued at another table, with a Melted Goat Cheese Fondue, as well as a Bleu Cheese Fondue. The goat cheese would taste great with some fig or orange marmelatde on toast, but otherwise it was flavorless to me - but creamy nonetheless.  The Bleu was outstanding!  Lovely creamy texture and savoery flavor.  It was excellent with the bread chips.  The night of tasting ended with samplings of their Cinnamon Churros with Chocolate Ganache, as well as mini Squash and Pumpkin Cupcakes with Molasses and Cream Cheese Frosting.  I can attest that we were all in saccharine heaven.  Overall, the incredible bites combined with the wonderful drinks, the sensual lighting at the patio at Province, and the DJs sultry beats - made for a very exceptional evening.  Thank you, Province, and Lindsey for making this a culinary night to remember!",

    "text": "Now here's a restaurant that knows how to do Arizona Restaurant Week right.  Went here my brother over the weekend after a D'Backs game.  The place wasn't that busy and we got excellent service throughout.  The place is on the bottom floor of the Westin Hotel/Freeport McMoran building downtown and has a huge wine display, a relatively small dining area inside and a quaint outdoor patio.  Very elegant yet pretty laid back.  They started my bro and I with a refreshing gazpacho and some hummus.  For appetizers, he got the shrimp ceviche while I got the crab and corn chowder.  Both appetizers were delicious and the portion sizes were small enough for the sauvignon blanc wine pairing that went with both of our appetizers.  For the main course, the restaurant paired our dishes with another glass of wine (pinot noir for him and and a cabernet sauvignon for me).  For the dish he got the green gazpacho salmon while I got the skirt steak with artichoke potatoes.  Wow.  Both paired wonderfully with the selected wines and the vegetables worked into both dishes in such a way that they both had a good clean flavor to both of them.  For dessert we both got a dessert sampler including a fruit tart, chocolate/peanut butter flan, and a squash cupcake with sweet cream.  The cupcake wasn't really my taste, but the flan and tart were both excellent.  In the end our stomachs were both full (but not explosive fortunately).  The portions for each course were manageable and elegantly prepared.  And the staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.    Lastly, a HUGE thumbs up to them for giving us coupons to come back again before the end of the year.  They offered this to everyone who came for Restaurant Week.  I had already planned on coming back again, but this made that all the more certain.  This place is a gem amongst the burgeoning downtown Phoenix culinary scene and they left both my brother and I full and smiling from start to finish.",

    "text": "The boyfriend and I indulged in a seriously delicious brunch here the other week... Hold on to your sweet tooth. We started with their donut holes. They are crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, covered in cinnamon sugar and served with a caramel sauce. Yum! Then I went with the pancakes. Their pancakes are served with diced cinnamon apples, granola and fresh whipped cream. You get a hefty stack and a side of pure maple syrup for added sweetness! I downed a couple mugs of their very good coffee as well. The bf ordered the club and he ate it all, so it must have been good!  Prices are very fair, more than fair considering this is set inside a Westin and hotels often mark food up astronomically.  The hotel valet is complimentary for those dining here.  Our server was kind, prompt and informative with our menu questions. My only complaint is the hostess was off setting up tables for a large party, so regardless of our reservation we waited about 6-7 minutes at the hostess stand before someone spoke to us.  Its not something that would keep me away, but I can't imagine its good for business to have customers standing around unacknowledged for that long.",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised does not come close to how I felt after stopping in last Thursday for \"Chill at Province\" which is held on Thursdays and Fridays with music (DJ Mike Hooker on Thursdays and live music by Micah Bentley on Fridays) and specials on drinks and apps until 7:00pm.  I have been to Province a few times and let's just say that they're not at the top or even on the middle of my list of places to hang out. They are going to the top of my list for Thursdays and Fridays.  Let's start with the music: DJ Mike spins some great tunes, very chill and relaxing...exactly the kind of music I was to unwind with after a long day at work.  Moving on the the specials:  -HUGE pitcher of Sangria for $10. You heard it right kids, $10 for a big pitcher of   Sangria.   -$5 pitchers of draft beer  -$3 for empanadas and tacos or $4 for flatbread.  We chose to imbibe on Sangria and beer and order some tapas: -Chorizo Meatballs topped with cheese and a tomato sauce with a kick---DELICIOUS -Artichoke and Goat Cheese Croquetas:not a huge fan of goat cheese but I was fine   with this -Crispy Fries with house made ketchup: fries are a dime a dozen. That being said,    these fries were pretty damned good!  Our bartender was awesome and attentive so we really had a great night and I will definitely be back once my liver has had a few days off.  The ONLY thing I would recommend is that these guys do something about the lighting....it is WAY too bright in there. The place would have a LOT more atmosphere and would compel guests to stay AFTER the specials end if they turned down the lights or even added some mood lighting.",

It works really well with the hotel. Example: it shares the adjoining courtyard which is lovely in the evenings.

He was outside cleaning and setting tables as someone who's run a business, that was exactly what you'd want to see from your leadership and that set the table of expectation for the rest of my visit.  His name was Alex.  He and our server Casey were excellent.  The food was pretty good too.  I'm a SW boy and had the brunch tacos- I subbed chx for chorizo and my inner fat kid loved it!  I live close & hadn't been here since they changed management.  They've changed the menu quite a bit to reflect regional tastes and they get two thumbs up. The other menu simply tried too hard.   Lastly- as we were leaving we wanted to see the pool above the restaurant.  Alex, understanding we weren't guests but could be at some point, made it a point to meet us at the gate we didn't have a key for to key us in the area.  Great anticipation and very memorable.  Obviously I recommend this place and my inner foodie does too.",

They changed  pasta type from fettucini to angel hair pasta which made the meal a little lighter for me,  which I thought was flavorful and wonderful.  I come to Phoenix about every 6 weeks and rarely eat at the hotel but I will change my ways after this visit.  Thanks for being so accommodating and welcoming!",
