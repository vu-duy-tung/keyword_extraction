I came in at around 4 in the afternoon and was greeted by the owners of the restaurant. They were very sweet and welcoming. The service was excellent.   Spicy salmon rolls are my go-to, and Yama's spicy salmon definitely did not disappoint. I had their seaweed salad as well and it was delicious - just the right amount of sweetness. In addition, I had their famous gyoza and I was quite pleased. It was not deep fried, and tasted very fresh. The decor of the restaurant was clean and classy, but not at all pretentious.   Last but not the least, it was very affordable! I came in during happy hour so it was really cheap, however the regular hour prices weren't bad AT ALL. I cannot wait to come back to try their other rolls and their ramen!",

I think the best sushi I have had actually comes from Yogi's over the obligatory top tens in AZ but I hate eating in a cafeteria setting.  I think they forgot the salt or flavor in everything.  Negatives:  miso soup has no flavor, add a tsp of soy to give it some  sushi has no flavor, I have no idea how the can do this but they have seemed to be able to extract flavor even from the ones with eel sauce and sriracha on them.   coconut shrimp's batter has no salt in it. The chili sauce cant save the blandness but a cocktail sauce could.  The teriyaki steak looked good but it tasted like it was boiled in water. I could see the sauce on it but when I took a bite it tasted like a naked steak with no seasoning at all. I dont know how that is possible.  I asked for salt and the only shaker they had was one with huge flakes in it. I doubt they had any in the kitchen.  Positives:  The food came quick. The waitress we had was great.",

I finished everything but the last few spoonfuls of soup.   Overall, this is a good place. It's not super high end sushi, but it's good, happy hour makes things super reasonably priced, and the service is really friendly and attentive. The hot night roll is a california roll, which some eel sauce and spicy tuna on top. The hot-sweet combo was perfect and the roll was the perfect size. The yellowtail carpaccio was also good, though I would have wanted to taste the ponzo sauce more. The jalapeno slice on the fish was one of those weird instances where you get a smoking hot pepper; this isn't something to be helped though. The agedashi tofu, wasn't really traditional. It didn't come with bonito flakes and I wanted more sauce. But! I left nothing on the plate, so it was still damn tasty.   I'd go again. Especially for lunch since it's close to work. The have some poke bowls that sound yummy. And they have some non-sushi items or even less traditional sushi items (like chicken teriyaki rolls) for those of you that aren't feeling the raw fish. You should try it!",

From the moment I walked in the sushi chefs greeted me which was awesome and welcoming. Once we were seated we were greeted by our server who was SO sweet and nice and attentive! We had miso soup to start and we tried a variety of rolls... EVERY SINGLE ROLL WAS DELICIOUS! Came in during happy hour and got such good deals! Not to mention, the server reminded that happy hour was approaching an end and if we wanted to add anything before happy hour ended. Coming from a restaurant background that is so rare and showed she cared more about our experience than making more money. I will definitely be going back and I agree with all the great reviews, I'm a fan lol",

However horrible that sounds it was an accident that was not looked over by the staff/management as they took amazing care of us for the rest of the night by: replacing my brothers shirt with a new clean dry one, a free appetizer and more. What started out as a not so great birthday dinner ended as one of the best costumer service examples we're ever witnessed.

I'm a ramen fan so I ordered the Tonkotsu pork ramen and what arrived was a strange broth that tasted like miso soup and was topped with Spam. I thought they mixed up my order, but was told no that was the correct pork ramen soup. I was clearly not enjoying the dish so the waitress very kindly offered to replace the soup with a sushi roll of my choice. I decided to try the Phoenix roll. It seemed decent enough until I bit into something that tasted so rancid I had to spit it out.  Now, my husband ordered a different sushi roll and it was OK. Nothing to write home about, though. So over all we were not fans of Yama.",

We ordered a large hot sake to share, which was delightful and enough for two.  To eat we had their gyoza to start. They were cooked perfectly, with one edge being nice and crispy while the rest were steamed to perfection. The oil on them was noticeable but it was a clean enough oil that it didn't impede upon the flavor.  Then we shared their Tidus and Yuna Love Boat which was incredible. It had a dragon roll which was good, a spicy tuna roll, again very good. Both met the standard for those kinds of sushi rolls. Then there were I think four different types of nigiri, all of which were beyond amazing. The octopus nigiri was my personal favorite as I enjoy the texture. And lastly there were 6 types of sashimi, 3 slices of each. The slices were generous without being too much to eat. They each practically melted in my mouth, which tells me that the quality of their fish is higher than many other sushi restaurants.  They also have fresh wasabi, which makes the meal absolutely perfect.  We then enjoyed their green tea mochi for dessert.  Our server Jason was very nice and extremely attentive. Our waters were never empty for more than a minute since all of their staff took the initiative to fill waters regardless of whether or not they were our server.  We can't wait to come back for another date night, or to try their happy hour!",

The waitress repeated the order but she was almost whispering and I was talking to my friend so I wasn't really paying that much attention. But apparently I should have. It takes 20 minutes to get food and she serves a Gyudon and a Donkotsu Ramen. Okay. I told her this wasn't my order and she brought it back to the kitchen, saying she will get me Katsudon. I didn't really think it would take 20 more minutes since they screwed up the order and if you rush it, it should NEVER takes 20 more minutes. You NEVER cooks the food like you JUST got the order from the customer. So I told my friend to start first but my meal is not getting served. ANOTHER 20 FREAKING minutes. She didn't check if my glass was empty or the food is okay for my friend.  Okay it's busy Thursday night at 7PM, let's give her a break. But seriously, the food. Really? First I am Asian. I'm not a big fan of CALIFORNIAN rolls, which most of snobby people would think as cool food, but I know what Japanese food should be like. But this Gyudon and Katsudon is never what I expected. The beef in the Gyudon, I don't even know what part of cow it is. They put too much ginger in the food and all you can taste is just ginger and the fat from the beef with salty sauce. The amount of the food isn't impressive either. Now the Katsudon, jesus Christ, who serves Katsudon in a flat plate? And what about the amount? The meat was thin only size of my palm. Mediocre taste and over-priced.  I don't necessarily wanna blame the waitress only on everything. But there are DEFINITELY not enough staff to cover the tables. I saw them running around and the other table getting served every 15 minutes. I don't know what the hell is going on, but they should really change the way they run A RESTAURANT. I assume the restaurant was busy not because the food was good but because it is on Groupon. And there were only 2 Asians out of at least 50 customers. And you know what that means.",

The only negative thing I could say about this place is lack of parking. But you can park on a side street or look for the two labeled parking spots. We were greeted and sat immediately. Our server was very sweet and attentive. We got our food within ten minutes of ordering. I got a chicken teriyaki bento and my wife got tako yaki and a tuna roll. The bento was stuffed with goodness. Teriyaki chicken on top of cabbage, white rice, a salad with ginger dressing, and I subbed a spicy crab roll instead of the California. I normally don't eat a lot but I ate the whole thing. Needless to say I may have found my new favorite sushi spot. It's small but that atmosphere is perfect. The food is great and the staff are amazing.",

I had the teriyaki chicken bento box which was very good. The teriyaki sauce on the chicken had a bit of sweetness to it that I enjoyed. The salad was heavily dressed but flavorful. It also came with rice and 4 California rolls. At $9.00it was very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. We finished lunch with the tempura cheesecake which was super yummy.

The salmon sashimi here melts in your mouth, and is better quality than big name restaurants.

The sushi tasted fresh, and the happy hour prices were very reasonable.  Service was great and I especially liked the free mints for dessert at the end!  The rolls here were on the heavier side when it comes to sauces, which some people probably will love and others will find less \"authentic\" - but then again, I've never been to Japan, so it's all good to me.  :)  Overall, I'd definitely come back, but probably only for happy hour since the usual prices are a little more than I'd be willing to pay.",

However, my favorite thing here was their gyoza. Normally I don't expect very quality gyoza from sushi places since that is not something they are supposed to specialize in but this gyoza was amazing! They have pretty good prices for happy hour. The only think that I would recommend staying away from is the appetizer which I believe is called tokoyaki. This was one of the weirdest things I've tried. I'm sure some people like it but I thought the texture was just super off putting. Nonetheless, this place has a great location right in central Phoenix and they have an outdoor patio. Great spot for happy hour",

    "text": "Went for lunch, and it was delicious! Very fast service and the iced green tea didn't taste like green water. Spicy Salmon roll was a little smaller than most places, and not too spicy, but it was tasty. Las Vegas was also good too though it was 75% crab salad. We also had  the golden avocado appetizer which was a little bit of spicy tuna in an avocado quarter, and tempura fried. Nothing wrong with that, totally delicious.  My favorite part was the salmon sashimi. It was nice and cold, fatty and was a thick slice. And to anyone reading this, if you have never tried that green leaf they add to the sashimi, try it!!! It's called Shiso and has an amazing flavor *swoon*  I wouldn't say it was the best sushi ever, but it was pretty tasty, especially for Phoenix.",

I had a spicy tuna roll for $4.00 and the tonkotsu ramen for $11.00. Both were great, but wow, that ramen was fantastic. I sat at the bar so I could get a look at the rolls being prepared, all looked delish with nice presentation.  Staff was super friendly/attentive and I liked the modern but cozy digs as well. I'll be back!",

For our main dishes, we got a mix of sushi - pink lady roll, ninja roll, spicy tuna (all yummy)- a bowl of ramen (with spam!!!), and the \"April Special\" Honey Sesame Chicken (the most perfect batter ever!). We finished the evening with a dessert feast of fried cheesecake, mochi, macha ice cream, and hot lava cake. Everything was delightful! The staff was so friendly & helpful & Chef Tony even came out to check on us and wish me a happy birthday! Thanks Yama, for an awesome night!",

Additionally, the fish was I'll prepared and poorly cut so despite it being of decent quality the consistency made a bad experience. The worst part however was the OLD sushi rice. Rice is very important to all sushi, but especially nigiri. The texture was tough and it was served cold. Most likely it was old, which is why I'm giving it such a bad rating. I would have given 1 if not for the decent selection and quality of fish (before cuts were prepared). I would not recommend this place.",

Menu prices seemed reasonably average, but then when our rolls came out I was a little surprised at their size. The rolls were a bit on the small side and I'm not sure they warrant the regular menu price, though super tasty. Shrimp tempura were also somewhat skinny and small compared to what we usually get when ordering the same at other places. Overall we enjoyed the food and the service was great. So will definitely return, but will shoot for happy hour next time.",

We ordered edamame, shrimp tempura roll, magic roll, spider roll and two sake sangrias. The sangrias were a little too syrupy for me but strong. The rolls were very tasty and enjoyed every bite. I probably wouldn't order the spider roll again because for $12, they only gave us a few pieces. I deduct one star because for the price, the portion size is on the smaller side. Usually, we order two rolls that is sufficient to fill me and my husband up at other Japanese restaurants. However, we had to order three rolls to fill us up.   Our order came to a little over $50. I will definitely be back for happy hour!",

There weren't many vegetarian options, most Japanese restaurants offer a tofu or veggie bowl (either with rice or noodles) and they didn't have this.  I ended up trying the two veggie rolls which were okay at best.   The nigiri was delicious per my boyfriend, and the sake was expensive for how little you received.

I looked on Yelp and saw this place and their great ratings so decided on this spot for lunch.  We arrive and are seated immediately. We place our orders. Luckily, everything we ordered was cold. All of a sudden, the power goes out for a few blocks. Patrons who ordered cooked foods had to leave. We ordered all raw fish so there was no issue. I felt so bad for the owner. He said food not eaten in 30 minutes will just go to waste. So he started to give us a free for all on food. We had some huge chunks of salmon. There were a few fish belly bites tossed in the mix. There was so much given I forgot if I actually received what I ordered.  When it came time to pay the owner said that his registers wouldn't work. We luckily had cash and we were treated so nicely and were provided generous portions that we paid what we thought was the bill. Others got to walk out without paying. A few who walked in after the power went out were turned away. The owner despite not being in the best business situation made the most of it. We lucked out with a few extra bites (by the way, everything was delicious).  The good karma will certainly go back to you, good sir.",

Service has also been lacking on most visits, and I've had my card ran for the wrong amount twice. On both occasions, they ran my card for more than our bill was, and gave us cash back to make us whole. On the last visit, the server admitted their system wasn't a True POS, so it was easy to get other tables mixed up when running cards.",

I came today for oysters (they were out) This is a new experience for me (place running out of oysters) Apparently they only come on certain days (huge disappointment) The miso soup is something I would not recommend just to be honest it taste like the package pre made Miso soups they sell at Fry's Grocery Store. The rolls were actually pretty good! They also came out pretty fast. I had the Spicy Tuna--Which had some spice unlike some places that state it is spicy but lacks the kick. I had the Scorpion Roll--MmMm delish, and I had the Eel Roll--Very Good--Not overdone and the rice was tasty. Also had the classic Vegas Roll--Great. This place is decent and worth the shot if you are in the area for your sushi kick. I have to add they play raunchy music--I would not be able to physically bring my daughter here--Not family friendly in that aspect!",

I couldn't have been happier with choosing such a small quaint sushi bar. Now the sushi was amazing, I recommend for those who love sushi to try the Las Vegas roll it is to die for. We also had the lollipop roll which was unusual and I have never seen before yet extremely tasty. We also got their gyoza aka dumpling and they were so delicious with an amazing dipping sauce on the side. I would recommend this to anyone who loves sushi and great service!

Service was outstanding.  Parking is a challenge. They only have a couple spaces out front, we had to circle the block to find street parking. No big deal but kind of a hassle.

Recently I messed up on a to go order and they totally fixed the order, though it was my fault. They did not charge for the fix, though I said it was my fault. It is just how they operate.",

I've been to several sushi places in the valley and they are usually more than willing to work with me. Unfortunately this is not the case here. They have a sweet lunch special with either a bento box or a poke bowl or some sushi. They were absolutely unwilling to substitute a veggie roll or tofu in any of the specials. I ordered the avocado roll off the regular menu. It was so tiny everyone laughed at it!  The tofu appetizer was tasty though. I would be willing to try it again if they would put a veggie option on the lunch specials!",

I especially liked the Phoenix roll. With that said I feel the need to clarify that I kinda felt like this was a bit run of the mill.. nothing special to really stick in my mind or wow factor. I also was disappointed that I only received minimal wasabi with my order. Four rolls and about a half tsp of wasabi?? Guyyyyyys I like it spicy ):   All in all not really disappointed but not wowed either. I'm used to SF area sushi so I may be a bit picky. I'd say this is prob a solid little spot but I don't think I'd return on my next trip to AZ. Gotta try em all though!",

Super friendly staff that make you feel welcomed, give great recommendations on food, and make sure you're having a good time!! Loved it!   I saw that this spot just opened up a couple weeks ago by our place so we went to try it for a late lunch. We had perfect timing because happy hour had just started :). The owner recommended the Gyoza - so glad he did because it was delicious! We normally just stick to edamame as our appetizer so it was a nice change that did not disappoint. We stuck to the happy hour menu for rolls and got the Godzilla roll, Hot Night roll, and the Vegas. They were all so good but the Hot Night was my favorite! You can't go wrong with spicy tuna on top of a roll :-). Support this new local restaurant. They offer the whole package - excellent service, great food, and great happy hour!",

The manager was super friendly and helped make my birthday memorable with on the house sake. The customer service here is some of the best I've ever seen--and it doesn't hurt that the food is delicious!  The second time I went to Yama, I got a to go order which was quickly prepared and tasty! The food at Yama is very reasonably priced too--especially considering how good it is.

First: The tables were so close together that when we were trying to get to our table we had to wait for the waitress to finish talking to the table next to us to get by.  Second: The rolls are a on the smaller side, which I understand since it's probably more expensive for them compared to California.  Third: The rolls aren't really that amazing, I have definitely had better and fresher tasting rolls before so after the third roll it was kinda hard for me to continue and enjoy it.  BUT we did go on their one year anniversary on the first friday of the month so they had a lot of discounted prices. That was pretty sweet.",

I couldn't even enjoy my meal because she was cussing and yelling so loud at them in the back AND IN  FRONT of all the customers. Definitely not manager material and needs to be let go ASAP!!!!

    "text": "I didn't expect this place to be good, yet it still was below my expectations.  The sushi rice itself was not satisfactory!  The grains felt tough/dry, not chewy.  Either the rice was undercooked or it has been frozen then thawed from another day's batch.  The Boston roll had thin slices of tuna.  The quality of tuna was not good.    The Sunshine roll was tiny!  My son was able to finish without getting full.  The baked lobster roll had very sparse \"lobster\" on it.",

    "text": "The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sake bomb / beers are way overpriced in my opinion. I originally tried this place about a year ago and ordered a boat of sushi. All in all, my boyfriend and I were not very impressed but it was also our first boat go around so maybe we didn't realize what we were getting ourselves into.   Fast forward to a week ago and we decided to give it another go around. They have reverse happy hour fri and sat from 9-11 pm so we figured we'd give it a try. We fell in love! Other than the overpriced sake and beer the sushi was amazing. Best spicy tuna roll in town and the tuna lover and black& white specialty rolls were delicious and left you craving more! The yellowtail and scallion offered nice full pieces of yellowtail and no fillers. The spicy yellowtail which was not on happy hour was also extremely good. We went back for more a day later and I can't wait to go back again.   We did try the golden avocado which was aesthetically appealing on the menu but I would definitely choose another spicy tuna roll instead of getting it hands down.  Service was great and very attentive. Everything we asked for was delivered quickly and accurately. We will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "I have no idea why this place is rated so highly.  I tried them tonight for the second time.  This time was through Postmates.  However, let me assure you that this was not a take out issue.   We live down the street from the restaurant and was delivered to us within three minutes of the order being ready. Both times I've ate here, I got sushi and tonight my husband got \"chicken katsu\" and \"fried\" calamari.  First of all the chicken katsu was not the katsu breading.   They looked like glorified chicken nuggets.  The sushi was sub par at best.  I get better sushi from the cafeteria at work and that's through Sodexo.  The real disappointment was the fried calamari.  This resembled nothing that is fried calamari except there were rings.  It was soupy- and while you can tell there was breading on it at one point by the starchy blobs floating in the sauce, the only crunchy part of it was the tough rings, that you had to keep chewing on to penetrate.  The flavor of the sauce was delicious, it's just a shame it was on the rubbery slimy mess I couldn't swallow. I tried two pieces and my husband tried one and spit it out.  It ended up going in the trash.  I understand Phoenix isn't exactly a Japanese cuisine/sushi town but this food was not good.  I will always give a restaurant a couple chances, in case it was just a bad night. Sorry to say both nights were such a disappointment.",

I am currently in my life  sushi phase so I have been eating sushi on the regular so I've had a good variety in the last 2 months.   The food here is sooooooo fresh. The Las Vegas roll is the best I've ever had because the sauce they use and the tempura batter is perfectlyight and crispy. You can tell the fish is extremely fresh which at times is difficult to find in the summer in Phoenix.   They have a happy hour special where if you buy a bottle of saki you get a free order of gyoza. The owner/chef sold this as his gyoza is the best in town. I love gyoza so this is a high bar to set .  He wasn't exaggerating. You can tell he makes his food with pride an love.   All of the staff is extremely friendly and attentive from sushi chef's to waitresses. Very proud of this self owned little business and even prouder to support it.",

I took my parents and each of them kept raving about how good their rolls were, and my dad is definitely on the pickier side. They have a great selection of nigiri and sashimi. I had seared tuna nigiri and it was excellent. One negative thing was the service was slow, but it was Friday at 7pm and it was really busy, so I'll let that slide for now. Definitely going to be returning here as my go-to sushi place.",

    "text": "After living down the street from Yama for about 6 months, my fiance and I finally decided to try it one night a couple of weeks ago, and I am glad we finally did! (We aren't sushi people, so that was our hesitation.)   We got there around 7:30/8p on a Saturday night, and the restaurant was very crowded, but our waitress was still attentive and extremely friendly. She didn't seem at all stressed by the number of tables she had to serve, which I thought was nice. It did take a while to get our drinks and our food once we had ordered, and I think this was maybe because the bar and kitchen areas aren't that big, but I don't know for sure.  To start, we ordered sake mules, which we thought was a fun concept and is something we have never seen before. They were pretty good - my fiance enjoyed his a lot even though I didn't as much, but I also don't really like mules so I'm not a good judge :) we then ordered the Sweet Spicy Crispy Calamari, and it was delicious! We order calamari just about everywhere, and had never had it in a sauce quite like this - I loved it!   For dinner we split a roll that was on special, which I believe was called the King Scorpion Roll. Like I mentioned, we really aren't sushi people, but this was a cooked roll so we decided to give it a try. It ended up being really good! We also split the Teriyaki Chicken dinner plate, and that was amazing! I would definitely go back and have some of that.   I did think this restaurant was a bit expensive, but considering what we got it really wasn't bad. I'd definitely come back and have since recommended it to friends who are into sushi! :)",

Fried avocado was really good, never had it anywhere else - it came with tuna I think. The magic roll is my favorite, it was wrapped with soy paper and had two different sauces on it. The salmon on top of the Alaska roll, was a thick cut salmon and not like other sushi places will give you a small piece! Yummy! All in all, everything we ordered was delicious!

The atmosphere is nice, cozy, simple decor, kind of modern, I found it pleasant. It was really cold temperature wise,  mentioned it to our server, she had someone turn up the ac, which was really considerate considering I was really cold and I didn't know if anyone else might have been too ( it was warm during the day, so it's understandable), it was great customer service to adjust the temp to make it more comfortable! We ordered a few different things off the menu, which is very neat and organized, isn't to overwhelming, easy to read. Any questions we had were answered. Our server again, was so kind to let us move over to the table next to us since it was bigger and the food we ordered was out growing the table we had been seated at. The food came out quickly, and we enjoyed everything we ordered! The sushi tasted great and very fresh! Our server was very sweet, very personable, prompt and very accommodating. I look forward to going back! Thank you for bringing central PHX a delicious sushi place!",

    "text": "For a Bay Area native who is used to fresh sashimi and sushi this place is worth a visit.   My friend and I used the Groupon to try this new highly rated sushi restaurant. We were immediately seated and are waiter was extremely attentive and polite. While our restaurant had monthly special rolls, we went with the spicy calamari, 2 chef special rolls and salmon sashimi.   Appetizer-Spicy Calamari: The fried calamari rings were drenched in a sweet garlicky spicy sauce over a bed of fresh cabbage. I love garlic so this dish was bursting with flavor. My only critique was I hope it was more on the lighter crispier side like what you would get with tempura flakes.   Chef Special Roll #1: Magic Roll smoked salmon with cream cheese wrapped in story paper and drizzled in spicy mayo and eel sauce...I'm usually not a proponent of cream cheese in sushi but this one was a winner.   Chef Special Roll #2: Lollipop Roll an array of fresh sashimi tuna, yellowtail, and salmon with avocado and a kani stick all wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber all of which was masterfully arranged like a lollipop with a toothpick...it was sweet and refreshing a great compliment to their saucy rolls.   Salmon Sashimi: Buttery and Fresh need I say more?   Summary: Awesome service and yummy sushi!",

My husband and I dined here on a Wednesday and we thought it was good but still needed some small tweaks to make it great.  Here are a couple of pros and cons:  Pros: -food was served quickly -presentation of food was done well  -flavors were great -very nice staff and very accommodating and polite -convenient location with parking -very clean and well decorated  Cons: -ramen noodles seemed to be from a package and reheated (not fresh) -pork in ramen was way overcooked -asked for shichimi soup spice and got sriracha the first time around...? -service was haphazard and awkward (possibly their first server job?) -server did not get us drink refills and didn't even suggest it until the end of our meal (our glasses sat empty for almost the full hour we were there) -SO LOUD!  the acoustics in this place made it nearly impossible to have a normal volume conversation or be able to hear my husband across the table even though it was not full (definitely recommend getting some sound muffling foam or something for the ceiling so the noise level stays low)  All-in-all the food was good, place was clean, staff were very nice, but the quality of the food/service, as well as the ear-piercing need some polishing.  I hope to try this place again in a bit to see how they progress.",

Having worked in the restaurant industry for many years in the past I have certain expectations.    This place exceeded them all!  The service is top notch.  Extremely friendly staff that is very welcoming and genuinely seem to care about the customers and enjoy what they do.  We had the pleasure of meeting the chef/owner and this man was a delight!  I just wanted to hug him!  We started with the spicy garlic edamame and the Agedashi Tofu.  Both were very flavorful and fantastically prepared.  We then had a sampling of different veggie rolls, sushi rolls, and nigiri.  Not one thing to complain about.  It was all very fresh and the veggies were crisp!  Dare I say...probably the freshest sushi I've had in the desert.    We will be back again and again.  It is walking distance from home and I have a feeling We will be regulars.

    "text": "I'm torn between a 3 and 4 star.  We went on a Tuesday night and were quickly seated.  They were busy, and it took a while to get a drink order in.  We ordered waters and a sake bomber.  The menu had a $5 bottle of Sapporo Light and didn't note that larger bottles were available.  Halfway through drinking, we ordered a second $5 bottle of beer (because you receive a generous amount of sake).  Then I saw other tables with larger bottles of beer and asked our waitress how much those were.  I was told $6.  It would have been nice if the large bottles had been listed on the menu or if we had been informed when ordering a sake bomber that larger bottles were available instead of spending $10 for something that could have cost us $6.  I let the waitress know of my disappointment.  It took a while for the order of spicy garlic edamame to arrive, which was well seasoned but a little too oily. Then it took a lot longer for our food to arrive.  After 10 minutes, we pointed out to the waitress that we were missing one of the rolls and were told it was coming.  It finally got to us about 15-20 minutes after the rest of the rolls, and it was explained that it had been delivered to the wrong table.  During the meal, I had to keep stopping the staff to ask for water refills, even though I placed my empty glass at the side of the table.  I only got one refill the whole time (they kept saying someone else was taking care of it), and I left very thirsty.    My vegetable rolls were wonderful.  My partner got four rolls (cucumber, avocado, vegas, and I don't remember the fourth) and said they were good, especially the avocado.  There are no vegan soup options except the appetizer miso, but they offered to make a vegan ramen with veggies for me, and it was great!  The prices are reasonable and the food was good.  We'll be going back and hoping they'll work out some of the service issues the longer they're open.",

I had to remind her about the miso soup, no big deal but we could have been eating the miso during the wait.    When we finally got our sushi we were excited! This was relatively good until I noticed that the rice was a little hard. My friend had the same observation. This was a little disheartening.   I probably won't be going back to Yama anytime soon, but it was a nice meal and worth the Groupon price.",

Next: the sushi is fantastic!!! It's not too pricy, and is a little smaller that sushi at other places I would say. But is soooo good. Everything feels very very clean here and I love the homey small vibey feel to it. 10/10 will always come back to this place.",

Maybe the rolls in the menu are a lot better. We started off with the sea weed salad and that was really good. We then Ordered the spicy crab and  I think Godzilla roll. The fried part on the Godzilla roll was the only thing I tasted. The spicy crab was ok. I also ordered the Ramen which was pretty good. We also had sake bombs to go with our meal and you can't go wrong with them. I love them. The outside patio here is pretty nice. The weather was perfect so it made it enjoyable. I'll be back to try something else off the actual or if anyone has any recommendations I'd love to hear about it.",

Miso soup looked like legit water soup also tasted like water as well. Ramen was flavorless. Sushi was not good. A waste of 50 dollars. Gyoza was ok. The water was top notch",

Yama S is an attractive Japanese restaurant with 5 Japanese chefs doing their job with aplomb behind the counter.  Our waiter, also Japanese, couldn't have been more helpful, kind and delightful.  I had the sashimi which was generous of portion and delicious to the taste.  My wife and daughter had the yakisoba noodles with veggies and chicken and they gobbled it all up without leaving the typical leftovers for me to devour like some male lion picking through the meat of a zebra corpse.  One very pleasant surprise was the price of wine.  No lie, they serve bottles for $20-25 which were very good.  This is a restaurant that punches above its price weight.  Dinner for 3 with bottle of wine and a cocktail was $110.",

Unfortunately, my mood changed as soon as I opened the bag my soup was literally just a cup with a lid that was too big for the cup with some tape over it. I should mention the sushi was not good at all. That's just my opinion.   I will never order from this place again nor ever visit do not waste your money... you're better off obtaining your  sushi roll and yummy soup from Yogis Grill. - And you probably won't be bullied by the restaurant for posting your own personal honest opinion on here.  Thank you, i don't need a refund nor an invitation all I need is for the responses to this review to stop, specially at 1am when I'm trying to sleep!!",

I am a sushi lover so I stick to that, usually. We've had their noodles and they are pretty good as well as their BBQ. The bento box is very generous.  However the high lite of all our visits where last Thursday when I was indecisive about what to order, and our waiter ask me what I liked.  After noticing that have octopus, I just couldn't resist and made sure the waiter knew I like octopus, then he added that they could make me a special roll. So the made an octopus, fresh salmon, skin salmon and eel sauce. I'll be honest I wasn't sure if those flavor would go well Together or if one ingredient would be overpowering, but they made it so well my special roll was incredible GREAT!  I would highly recommend to suggest what one likes as they are happy to accommodate.  The roll was tight, not to much rice, doesn't come apart, I've never been disappointed. Great service as well. We are regular here, and can't wait to go back again!",

The selection has a lot to offer and the setting is really intimate. We ordered the tempura shrimp for an appetizer and they came out super fast and fresh. Really good for starters. Then the rolls came fast and furious. The philly, Las Vegas, Magic, and octopus nigiri. This place ran like a well oiled machine but did not disappoint in the service and sushi masterpiece!!! Great little spot and highly recommend.",

We tried the Lollipop specialty roll, which was tuna, salmon, yellowfish, and imitation crab in a roll form, and instead of rice and seaweed, the outer wrap is thinly sliced cucumber. It is skewered on the side with a cute toothpick to give the 'lollipop' look. The 5 pieces of the roll were bathed in a light soy sauce-based sauce. Very refreshing dish to have on a hot summer day. I highly recommend getting this roll!  Then we ordered the sashimi party platter, which is a June special. It was a large platter of fresh, beautifully presented salmon, yellow tail, red clam, white and red tuna. Very filling and price was very reasonable.   We also ordered unagi sashimi. It was delicious as well.  Other have commented on the lack of parking in front of the restaurant. This is True, but you can parallel park on Pierson, which is the small street just north of that strip mall.   This place is very deserving of 5 stars, and I will definitely be returning.",

We have been in the Phoenix, AZ area for 18 months and have been trying out different places.  Until today, we have not found any sushi restaurant that compares to the SF Bay Area.  We found this place by using Yelp and decided to try it out because of the good ratings the restaurant received.  My wife and I were totally happy with the quality of the fish.  The fish was fresh and tasty.  My only critique would be that the sushi portions were on the small side.  Given the small portions, I would say the prices are slightly too high.  But we will be back.  Most of the tables are for parties of two with a couple for a party of four.  More than four, they will be to do some rearranging.",

Honestly the teriyaki chicken disappointed me a lot, not good, mushy chicken and pretty bland.  But i gave it another try because of the reviews on Yelp.   So the day that i came for dinner i experienced fantastic service and food!  Visited on a Wednesday night (ladies night, half off red wine).  We got three tonkotsu ramens and one yakisoba noodles dish.  All were delicious.  And the service was great too.  Very friendly server, waters filled promptly, very attentive.  We will definitely be back to try the sushi!",

The Casual decor makes it appealing for lunch.  The service was incredibly friendly from the moment we arrived. Very attentive,  and quick to appease the guests requests.  We were given a First Friday menu that listed discounted items. Which is an automatic plus,  for cost conscious sushi fans. We chose the Gyoza as a starter, and were not disappointed. The texture was soft and spongy,  and the pork was very flavorful.  We then moved on to the sushi rolls. The selection overall was pretty mediocre,  no crazy creations that were out of the ordinary. The Salmon Nigiri and Spicy Tuna were fresh,  but nothing spectacular. The Playgirl roll had a nice spiced mayo atop salmon and avocado,  but again nothing to get excited about.  I'm giving this place four stars because of the awesome service and price point. Definitely a good future lunch spot,  but the sushi isn't spectacular or unique enough for top tier status.",

Best Sushi place in AZ I have ever eaten is Shimogamo. Made by real japanese. It's as close as authentic taste in my opinion. I have been to Japan before so yea I have taste real quality food there. People that said this sushi place is great had no idea what they are missing.   On the other hand, their entree isnt too terribly price or taste weird (compare to their sushi). I would suggest getting entree rather than sushi if you must come here to eat. Their omurice is actually not bad.   Service can be horrid especially when you order for pick up and was told it takes 15 mins, you went there and they made you wait another 15 mins and more. I order for pick up percisely because I dont want to wait that long. Manager was the one taking my order too and told me the time which made the situation worse. It seems like he didn't know his own kitchen.  The good: They have done a good job with decorations of the place. I appreciate it when a place put effort on making their restaurant presentable. But its sad when something is pleasant to look at but hollow and has not other quality.   The cons outweight the pros when it comes to this place though.",

Very prompt and helpful. They all seemed to enjoy their job. I assume they are either family or the management has trained them well. We were impressed.   The sushi was top shelf good. We got the Baja Roll, Godzilla roll, and the Hot Night. The presentation was very good but wow the quality is what i remember most. The rice, sauces, an textures were balanced and robust. So damn good!  Parking was a bit of a hassle becasue it looks like they are replacing thr blacktop. They are closed to the central light rail stop though!",

They came out crispy and hot!   Up next, the star of the show. The Last Vegas Roll. A deep fried roll with fresh eel, cream cheese, avocado, crab mix and topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. $7 on First Friday, smokin good deal.",

I went here looking for popular types of sushi, such as fresh Yellowtail, Crunchy Tuna etc and they didn't have anything I was looking for.   What I enjoyed most was the Hand Roll.

We also had gyoza, which tasted like it was made from a packet, and not cooked enough.  The service was very friendly, which slightly made up for the mediocre food.

My only wish would be that they would have more vegetarian options of rolls. My server couldn't understand me too well as to what I was trying to ask for, that also could've helped a bit. In any case, dinner was delicious. I'm still thinking about it. Can't wait to visit Yama again soon.",

No worries- there were a good number of other rice/noodle dishes that we could choose from. I ended up going with the gyudon and my date got the chicken teriyaki and a salmon skin roll. I loved my gyudon because the sauce was a good balance of sweet and salty, and the portion was actually pretty good! The chicken teriyaki is pretty standard and again, the portions were also good. My date reported to me that the salmon skin roll wasn't that good- he thought it was a bit dry, and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that or not, but regardless he didn't like it.   Our server was so amazing! I wish I got her name because she was so sweet and attentive to our needs and she made the experience a pleasure!

Thankfully aoili and eel sauce don't appear on most rolls (a pet peeve). Ingredients seemed fresh as one would expect.   Parking: VERY LIMITED. Take the light rail and walk a block or 2 south to the restaurant. This is really an issue for Central Phoenix and it is so for this location. I parked in the high rise apartment guest parking (overflow?).   Ambiance: Perfect upscale sushi restaurant, and the misters are exactly what the patio seating needs during the summer.",

I am usually more of a sashimi fan, which no doubt was excellent, but this place also does rolls really well.   A lot of sushi places that I have been to go overboard with either the toppings or the rice to fish ratio which really is a huge deal in making sushi great. The rolls at Yama are done just right. We tried a few different rolls and all of them tasted great with the right amount of fish and toppings.   They do have happy hour menu available and a lot of the rolls are offered on it which definitely is a bonus. Highly recommend this place to sushi lovers!",

This is the only place in Phoenix that I've tried so far, that has given me the feeling of home! The fish is delicious and fresh. The staff is so kind and nice. It's rarely super busy so we always get sat and start eating almost immediately. Pro tip: go on Sunday's after 2 for happy hour. Miso soup becomes a $1, and the price of the rolls gets seriously reduced. My favorite roll is the Hot City Roll (I believe that's what it's called). SO GOOD!",

    "text": "Summary: Avoid this place. I experienced shady practices by a guy who was either the manager or owner. Will not return!  The long version: I bought two Groupons to this place for \"$25 worth of food.\"  Visit 1: Ordered $22 or $23 worth of sushi and was told I'd have to pay the tax. I have used Groupon many times and have never had to pay the tax in a situation like this. Not even once. I was a little annoyed, but it's not the biggest deal in the world.  Visit 2: I ordered a chicken dish (which tasted terrible, by the way) along with some sushi. The total came to about $27 after tax. I present the Groupon when asking for the bill, and I'm then told by the waitress that it's only valid for sushi. It turns out it does say that in the fine print, but the title of the Groupon is \"$25 Worth of Food for Two or More\" NOT \"$25 Worth of Sushi for Two or More\". I then asked our waitress if I can talk to the manager.  The manager/owner comes over and I'm thinking \"Certainly they'll make an exception. After all, the title says '$25 worth of food.' Not to mention, their food costs are much lower on chicken then they are on sushi. Chicken dishes are always among the most profitable dishes for restaurants.\"   Me - I tell the manager that I neglected to read the fine print, and the title of the Groupon is misleading. I then asked if he can make an exception. Him - \"No, we can take $17 off your total bill, which is the cost of the sushi.\" (At this point I'm thinking \"EVERY other restaurant in Phoenix would've made this exception\") Me - Well, can we order a sushi roll to go since we'd have $8 left on the Groupon? Him - \"No, you can't take it to go. We want customers to come in and enjoy the experience.\"  This is perhaps the most unreasonable restaurant manager I have ever encountered as a customer. I will not return and will recommend that people do not go here.",

It also took her about 15-20 minuets to bring out the beers that we ordered, and same thing was happening to people next table, few people didn't get a silverware and couldn't start eating for a while because she wouldn't even come to a tables, everybody was pissed. It wasn't even busy in the restaurant, just 3 or 4 tables. And she had like 3 dirty tables after other people left and never cleaned them the girl from the kitchen had to come out and clean it for her. It was horrible service like this for a first time ever, on top of it it was my birthday and my mood was completely ruined. We still love your place because food is absolutely amazing all the time as well as the rest of your staff but hopefully that girl will get a proper training so she doesn't affect the impression of your future customers. Low stars just because of her.",

The ahi tuna was pink, (frozen?) if fresh it would be a dark red. They also did not cut the fish correctly, again making the fish more chewy than melt in your mouth. It was as if the place is low on cash, buying poor cuts of fish, and hired someone who is not a trained sushi chef. Not recommended if you expect to eat good fish.",

The avocado is so rich and creamy. Also tried the gyoza and you can tell they are hand made very delicate skins and rich pork flavor. The spicy calamari is super tender and heat was just enough to get your attention without setting your head on fire. The hot night roll simply super with the crab and avocado and the tuna on top with eel sauce and was rolled and cut into perfect bite sizes. The restroom was tidy and clean. The only thumbs down was the noise level - three tables of diners and it seemed very hard to hear. Please take a chance and try them out, would love to see them succeed.",

    "text": "I used to have this place deliver food to my work via grubhub. I always enjoyed the Las Vegas roll and the Golden Avocado. I shared with coworkers and they were in awe of how crispy, fresh and delicious the food was.   However, I have had some less than satisfying food experiences during my lunches with Yama's food. The yakisoba was a bit bland and just tasted a tiny bit like Chinese 5-Spice. It was my first time trying yakisoba. I was having my \"cheat day\" (but it is always cheat day when I am ordering Yama) but I was excited to go to town on that yakisoba! I expected it to have a better flavor sauce, or something.   The other thing I was less than happy with was the takoyaki. It was something new I wanted to try. I love squid and from what I had seen online, takoyaki looked awesome. I wasn't prepared for the gooey texture when it arrived, and I couldn't stomach it. That being said, I decided that since takoyaki is a \"favorite\" or frequently ordered menu item according to grubhub, I figured I would let it slide. It is probably a very authentic dish that just wasn't on my palate's radar.   Anyway, I decided that the Golden Avocados and the LV roll are my #1 favorites from Yama, but the baked lobster roll is also great. Wash it down with a Bundaberg ginger beer!",

The tonkotsu ramen was perfect for lunch when I came here on a cold day; the ramen was piping hot, the broth was very flavorful with a generous mix of ingredients such as cured egg and slices of pork. I returned for happy hour two days later and got the godzilla roll and a spicy salmon roll - both excellent, and I washed them down with a refreshing glass of Sapporo beer. Yesterday I came with a friend and we enjoyed excellent shrimp tempura, ramen, salmon roe nigiri, and a delightful blossom roll. The very friendly staff, very reasonable prices, the modern Asian decor, and of course the excellent food make dining here a True pleasure and I know more return visits are in order.",

The one star is in regards to the man who sat us and made accommodations for our stroller and another waitress who smiled when she passed me and my child on the way to the restroom. Short story short, we waited a little more than 10 minutes at our table, never received any menus. 4 employees were seated eating, I'm sure they were on their lunch and I'm not mad about that but they completed their lunch break and we still did not receive service. We waited a few more minutes to see if anyone would attend to our table and still nothing. Since we are visiting from out of town, I'm sure we won't be returning to try again.",

Also, My Wife and I only eat a few types of fish... so I can't speak to the menu in depth.    The owner was amazing, super nice and genuinely helpful.  He almost got my review to 4 stars.   The server was good but wasn't great.  Server didn't explain one of the dishes well and we ended up getting some extra stuff we didn't want.  We didn't make a fuss about it since this is a new restaurant.  She was kind though.    Salmon nigiri was awesome, the rolls selection wasn't our style.   But the manager did offer to customize however we wanted.  Wish was nice.  My wife didn't like the Ramin.  She thought it had no flavor at all.    I say definitely give this place a shot.  Decor is cool.  Small place, but really comfortable.     Lastly, they had music playing and the song \"Killing in the name\" came on.  For those you who don't know who RATM is, they're an awesome band but have tons of F-bombs in that song.   We had our 4 year old son with us and had to distract him from the lyrics.  We're pretty easy going and strangely got a kick out of it.  But geez, pretty bold sushi spot jamming rage.  Zack de la Rocha says it best in the song \"come on\"!

I finished the Spicy Yellowtail because I was desperate, but had to use an obscene amount of the play doh Yama calls wasabi to make this palatable.

They have been in business for one year and celebrated their annual anniversary the day of our visit. They were generous with all of their customers and had a complimentary mimosa for the occasion!    We tried almost like everything!  The best thing and a must try on the menu was the yellow tail belly carpaccio --- we had 3 of these!  Other popular rolls for us were the spider rolls, rainbow  roll, tuna lovers roll, striped bass, and the pink roll (literally is pink soy paper)!   I could go on and on because we loved this place so much we kept ordering!!!  They even cater to your wants and desires, such as change the sea weed to soy paper, add jalapenos or light on the rice!  Nothing was a problem to make the experience right!  This is our sushi go to from now on and the only place I'm recommending is this place!  If you haven't gone, go!  If it's a drive for you, it's worth it!  Parking isn't an issue and I'm serious, I stand by this review, no disappointments here!    Cheers Chef Tony!  What a success!",

I highly suggest Yama Sushi House. Really nice, friendly service and a quiet atmosphere. Happy hour is 100% worth it and the time I go the most. Cheaper sushi and drinks, you can't go wrong.",

Like her shift wasn't over and she was there when we left. Maybe she was just an inexperienced server that doesn't realize you don't take a change canister or whatever crap they use till someone leaves the table. But I guess I like tipping the waitress like 60% for mediocre service. Lol. The bar next door was absolutely insane to the point where it ruined the patio, it is central Phoenix though so what should I really expect?? Maybe it was a bad night, I will try it again.",

The food was good, a definite 4 stars. The restaurant itself is small and quaint and wasn't too loud or busy around the time I went which was noon on a Friday. The staff and the sushi chefs were Asian which is a definite plus. I would return and try this place again",

Also, their soup is flavorful, not salty and fulfilled my craving for ramen noodle. If people don't know by now, the gyoza is a must order. With that said, they should make dumpling soup.",

Also, the squid salad is a great appetizer along side a seaweed salad. Love love love this place!  The prices aren't too bad either for sushi.

Honestly, are the five star reviewers eating at the same place I did?? I appreciate venues that let fish shine and offer a variety of flavors within their house menu: sweet, crunchy, fishy, savory, tart, earthy, etc...so was disappointed to find a menu heavily featuring krab, cream cheese, excessive sauce, and mostly salmon or tuna--small amounts at that. I can't even say I liked the seasoned rice, which recalled a guilty grocery store sushi purchase. Nigiri was dry and chewy. Overall, the best roll at our table was just OK. Service seemed to over-compensate as if aware. Didn't feel the happy hour contained any sushi gems. Can't speak to the quality of hot dishes as we ordered sushi only.  The location and interior are charming and staff kind and competant, so in my heart I'm rooting for Yama House to flourish! But as a somewhat experienced sushi goer, I can't endorse the star attraction. At least at the time of this review...",

I've had fresher fish on sushi rolls and though their uni nigiri was creamy it lacked flavor and sweetness. Their takoyaki was tasty but the octopus was barely there, the pieces were too small. The omurice was flavorful, but the chicken was too dry and the egg wasn't fluffy. Additionally, for the quality, this place is overpriced. If you are looking for fresh fish that's more nigiri or sashimi style and hot foods I would recommend Hana Japanese Eatery.",

Arizona sushi is always kind of questionable, and most places rely more on fancy rolls in order to dodge the question of how fresh the fish is. Here, they have great rolls also, but the quality of the nigiri is excellent.   I haven't had such delicious Tuna or Salmon since being in Japantown in LA. This is an outstanding little restaurant. There aren't many tables here -- the owner came over and was very friendly. I can see why they have great reviews on Yelp. Server Amy was always there when we needed her. Just a great experience.  The only mistake I made was in ordering some Sake that Amy recommended. It was delicious. But this tiny little bottle was very expensive. That's my fault--I should have asked before ordering. I just figured, \"How much can a little tiny bottle of sake be, anyway!\" Big mistake.   We'll definitely be back. We intend to be regulars. And we're in the \"mood for sushi\" regularly!",

    "text": "This place absolutely amazed me! From the customer service to the food, this was an all around great experience. The owner came out to introduce himself and even shook our hands as we all left. We got some standard rolls (Las Vegas Roll, Crunchy Salmon Roll) and then their Hot Night Roll which is now my new favorite roll! The rice tasted much fresher and moist than any of the sushi restaurants I've eaten at. We also got a Ramen dish and it was equally as amazing. Their Happy Hour is from 2p-6p weekdays and has a great selection of standard and specialty rolls at a reduced cost. I like that they have two sizes of the Saki Bombers because I can never finish the larger size of Sapporo. We mixed it up and also tried Asahi as well. Amy was our waitress and was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back for sure.",

    "text": "For a brand new restaurant, the owner sure doesn't treat customers like he wants them to return. Beware of the shady practices here! The first time we ate here, we used a \"$25 Worth of Food for Two or More\" Groupon. Although the total was less than $25, they said tax wasn't included and we had to pay for that separately. That was strange because I've used dozens of Groupons and **never** needed to pay for tax. Okay, fine. But it gets worse.  The 3rd visit, my boyfriend used a Groupon (the same one). At the end of the meal, they explained that it only covered sushi, so the chicken dish wasn't included. Obviously this was confusing since the Groupon said \"$25 Worth of FOOD for Two or More.\" We asked if they could make an exception because the title was misleading and the manager came over to say that no, they wouldn't because in the fine print (the very last sentence) said it was only for sushi. What he *could* do, was let us order another sushi roll. (Um, duh. We were under the $25 amount). He did make sure to mention that since we didn't tell the server beforehand that we had a Groupon, he didn't even have to let us use it at this point. What?? So, we asked for the last roll to-go. He explained that we couldn't do this because he wants guests to enjoy the experience in the restaurant, not take food with. Ridiculous! We did sit down, we did experience the restaurant, and now we wanted the last roll to-go. Ugh.   Any reasonable owner would have made an exception since the Groupon title was confusing, but instead, his unreasonable and unsympathetic attitude has made us swear off this place for good.   (By the way, that terrible-tasting teriyaki chicken definitely cost less than the sushi roll, so it would have been in the restaurant's best interest in terms of profit/cost to allow that anyway.)",

Even though it was very busy that night, the servers came around often to fill our beverages/clear our dishes/etc., but not to the point of smothering us with attention. In that regard, I think they hit the perfect note. However, the quality of food was VERY underwhelming. Actually, the actual phrase I used after paying the bill was, \"I feel like I got robbed.\" Our order of chirashi had pieces of fish that were not properly cut - there was one piece that was still attached to another. That tells me the sushi chefs are not properly trained. Not only that, the pieces were tiny. There was a large mound of fine julienne daikon to make it look hearty, but the serving was so small for an $18 dish. The rice underneath was not sushi rice, either. Most Yelpers seemed to have enjoyed their rolls (they were just OK in my opinion - nothing to write home about), but if you're looking for quality sashimi/sushi, this is NOT the place. Save yourself the heartache, and hit up Hana (BYOB -what!) or Hiro instead.",
