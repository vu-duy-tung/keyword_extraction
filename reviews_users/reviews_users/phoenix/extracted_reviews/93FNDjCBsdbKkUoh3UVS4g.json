We know that they stoke the ovens between 4-5 and know there can be quite a wait. We don't mind waiting the time to get good quality pizza. The reason I am only giving it three stars after this visit is because of the staff.  Especially the host Francisco.  He is rude!  He speaks in a condescending tone.  Especially if you have parties larger then 4. He acts annoyed.  During my 45 minute wait for a table I watched people that wanted tables that had larger parties be spoken in a tone and manner that was not respectful.  Love your pizza but please come up with a better system for parties over 4 and by all means please coach your lead host on how to deal with people.",

They have an excellent by the glass or bottle wine list and their beer selection is also good.  They have an excellent Caprese salad that we like to have as an appetizer before our pizza.  Their menu is small, mainly pizza and a few salads, so if you are looking for a place with lots of choices (pastas, sandwiches, etc) Grimaldi's may not be the place for you.  But if you are looking for amazing pizza, I would highly recommend giving Grimaldi's a try.  One thing to keep in mind:  weekend evenings can be very busy, so I suggest going at slightly off times or bringing a dose of patience.",

    "text": "Ok, so I seem to agree with everyone here from the 5 stars to the 1 star. The pizza is simply fantastic. I understand they use a filtering system for their water which explains the delightful crust. The mozzarella is top notch,  they use quality pepperoni and other meats.   Like some of the others here though, I have experienced downright shoddy service. The management is lackadaisical to the point where I took the time to write the corporate office. To be blunt \"he just doesn't give a damn\". That is too bad because the place is just screaming to be a success. I know that I have avoided this place, just based on the management alone. We have a wood fired pizza joint (Sal's Tuscan grill) nearby which has really good pizza as well and when I am peeved at Grimaldi's, I go there instead.  It isn't as  good as Grimaldi's but customer service counts for something. GET OVER YOURSELF and treat your customers with some respect.",

I was really looking forward to it since the reviews were so good. First impression wasn't great, our server was probably one of the rudest servers I've ever had. She had a terrible attitude and seemed to overall hate her job. We were all really polite to her so I'm not really sure why she was so grouchy. On to the food, it was OKAY. Most definitely not anywhere near the best pizza I've ever had but maybe a slight improvement over dominos or Pizza Hut. It was essentially tasteless. There was little seasoning and almost no flavor. I think if I had a slice of cheese instead of the supreme I ordered it would have been even worse, the toppings definitely masked the blandness. Lastly it was super expensive. For any good topping add on its an additional $2-$7. Overall the service was bad and the pizza was mediocre.",

I have never had a bad experience in any way in any of the times I've eaten at this location or any other one for that matter. Grimaldi's gives a consistently professional experience and always has scrumptious food.  Today was no different. My husband and I we were in for lunch so we started with a small Mediterranean salad to share (that we could have split to with more people as well) and a half carafe of the house wine.   We ordered a pesto pizza with beef meatballs, jalapenos and mushrooms. The thin crust is delicious the pesto is to die for. It is one of my favorite pizzas in the valley.   We ended the meal with a slice of Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake and a glass of Moscato. The service was spot on and the entire experience was enjoyable. I highlt recommend Grimaldi's to everyone!",

    "text": "Honestly? I'm just done with this Grimaldi's. The service absolutely SUCKS and last night's effort was definitely a perfect example of what's wrong with this location.  We had a 1 hour wait last evening, which was excessive given there were tables that were empty waiting to be filled for quite some time. Secondly, we ordered 2 salads but only received 1 of them. We waited so long for the other, the pizza came out first so we cancelled the other salad. No apology. No offer of making it up to us...nothing. There were at least 1/2 a dozen times when a server or a guest broke a dish or glass while we were there. It was almost to the point where people should have started shouting OPAH! afterwards! At one point during our meal, a child raised a plate over his head, smashed a plate to the floor (to which the parents did NOTHING--but that's another story) right in front of the server. The plate broke in a thousand pieces, several of which hit us in the legs. It took at least 15 minutes before someone came and swept up the remnants of the broken plate. That is unacceptable but......Did the manager come over? Heck no. He didn't even MOVE or turn around from his seat at the bar where he was parked watching the Spurs/Heat game. That's right. The manager parked his butt in a seat at the bar the entire time. He would randomly get up and go cut a pizza from time to time, without washing his hands first mind you, but he never came around to a single table, never looked up once during the parade of broken dishes, and could not have been any less involved in his shift. The pizza took so long to arrive that it was actually cold and the crust was soggy.   Done. There's just no reason for this when Grimaldi's isn't a cheap visit at all. I've given too many chances and it's just not worth it.",

I have eaten lots of pies at  Grimaldi's original location under the Brooklyn Bridge, and I have  to say this Grimaldi's has equally great pies.  We arrived at 11:00 after watching a movie and we were seated within minutes. Our server took our drink order, and the drinks were delivered quickly. On this visit we kept it simple, a small pepperoni, double cheese pizza.  The small pizza is enough for two people (16\"). The  pizzas are thin crust, crispy, and  delicious.  We were filled from our pizza, but  we couldn't pass up desert. So  we went with  the \"trio\" for desert.  You pick any three deserts off the menu. We tried the Tiramisu, Oreo cookie cheesecake, and Cannoli. My favorites was the cannoli. Grimaldi's has great food, service, and staff, which always keepd me coming back.",

Now that I live in Arizona, a Grimaldis is always close by.  Decided to come down to this one in Peoria (It's only about a 15 minute drive from my new house) for lunch.  I ordered a large cheese pizza and a Diet Pepsi.  I kept it simple today.  Pizza was as good as always.  Great thin/charred crust, fresh mozzarella, great sauce and a little basil.  It's a perfect pizza!  I ate 4 slices and brought the other half home for dinner.  Service was friendly and my waitress brought me another soda right when I was about done with my first...she was on point!  The manager came by to everybody's table and asked them how the food was too.  I will be back sooner than later.  This pizza today made my move to AZ worth it ;-).  I can't say enough good things about Grimaldis.",

All you get for the $15 is cheese.   Let's cut to the chase....To charge $14 extra dollars for toppings is outrageous !!!!  For an iced tea, small salad and a pizza.....it set us back $43.09.  Each side was charged as tho it was a full serving of the topping.....each side of the pizza was charged doubled for mushrooms and olives....and it was pretty skimpy.   So when I questioned the bill.....the waitress says.....that's just how we do it if you order a 1/2 and 1/2.  A little heads-up would have been great.  I can say it greatly affected her tip.   The service was good......salad would have been better (not so soggy) if she had put the dressing on the side as I asked.   This is 'average' pizza at best.......While I do not have a problem paying a premium for a killer pizza.....but this was not it.  Planning on another trip to the area in a few weeks.....and we will try someplace else.  I also informed the hotel to stop recommending this place.",

Super disappointing for such a fantastic family-friendly restaurant.

The waiter did not know the menu at all. I asked for Aqua Panna and he said they didn't have it. Said they have Pellegrino. Being a long term me customer I knew they did. I had to express lain the difference of sparkling and still water. The pizza was under cooked. Soggy crust that collapsed like a wet noodle when I picked it up. I asked for it to be cooked more and the waiter said he could not do that. First time in 15 years that I have had a bad experience. Quality control is hard to do when you expand your business and this one will not help them or do them justice if they do not train wait staff and cooks on standards. I am just disappointed because I really push this pizzeria to all my friends. I drive 45-60 minutes from my residence to eat at the closest one to my house once a month. It is always worth the drive. I just want them to be better.",

Our waiter took it back without any questions & had a new one made (& we appreciated it) We received another one but by that time I was over the whole experience.

We ordered 2 pizzas with Pepperoni and chicken sausage. The pizzas were large and very thin as a ny style pizza usually is. The crust was slightly crunchy and the taste of pizza was fantastic. From the sauce to the toppings everything was top notch. The chicken sausage was spicy so it made the pizza great. We also ordered some wine for our meal and for dessert some NY style cheesecakes. These were nice and creamy. Yum! The service was also fantastic as the servers were very attentive. The restaurant was crowded and definitely had a nice elegant vibe. Prices were a tad high but well worth it. Would definitely recommend. Will be visiting Glendale again soon and this will be one of my must stops. Thank you Grimaldis for creating a great experience for my family and i.",

Hands down the most amazing pizza that has ever entered my mouth. It's a little more on the pricey side, but all pizza lovers know that you gotta pay for pie. If you want cheap take your ass over to little c's. Quality, my friends, quality. Order the caesar salad as a starter and I promise your food journey will be a gift that keeps on giving.",

    "text": "THIS is what passes for gourmet pizza in Glendale? I think not. You're kidding me. Grimaldi's is a sweet looking place in the desolate Park West. The decorations are great, and there is plenty of Sinatra playing to further the illusion of class, but once you sit down and look at the menu, the disappointment starts flying at you.  Appetizers? I think not, unless you're feeling like salad. There is salad, pizza, and wine. Also, a full bar, with beer. Not that having a simple menu is bad, it's just that when pizza is all you make, I expect mind blowing pizza. This falls flat on all levels.  The crust I'll admit was decent. Just the right amount of flavor and charring. You're getting that right. But the tomato sauce? Nothing special. Do they buy it from Safeway? The cheese? Just alright for a gourmet pizza, and certainly not enough of it. As far as toppings go, I don't like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered. Also, I feel every gourmet pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option. 'Ham' just isn't cutting it.  Don't fret, the white pizza was okay. It used just the right amount of garlic, and had a fair balance. It was a bit on the bland side, and I would definitely have olives on that if I ever came back.  But please, Grimaldi's, spare us all your pretentiousness. No matter how many decorations (your plastic hostesses included) you put up, or how much backstory you have about NYC, you define mediocre. Don't offer me some BS wine pairing with your pizza, the only pairing it deserves is a mug of Budweiser and a Yankee's game. It's just not quality stuff. Some poor chump is going to waste $40 on a pizza and some $5 BevMo wine thinking he's dining on something amazing. Meanwhile, I'll be enjoying my meal at a place like Piazza Al Forno. Take notes.",

As I had two young children with me, the server brought small lumps of dough for them to work on, which kept them delightfully occupied. The service was good and timely. It was a little slow and getting the bill and the payment, but otherwise excellent!!",

The salad came out on a cold plate (!) and the romaine was crazy fresh and crispy. The croutons were the most amazing toasted bread and the dressing was light and flavorful. The pizza was heaven. I got the four cheese, which was the perfect blend of salty, creamy, and chewy, with a crust that was light and crispy and not overwhelming. Delicious!   The best part of the dining experience was our server. You know, you get a lot of so-so servers,  some really bad ones, and only a handful of really great ones. The gal who served us (I think her name was Emily)  was just phenomenal. She was fast and efficient, anticipated our needs, and made sure we got out in time to get to our movie. My mom and I were both really impressed with her professionalism and clear ability to do her job well.   All in all, it was a great first visit and I expect to eat there again.",

After being completely ignored by literally every employee (yes, we made eye contact, still ignored) the hostess finally arrived to tell us that they cannot take any orders for pizza (at a pizzeria) after 3:30 pm. So they can clean the pizza oven, in the middle of the day. I've been to quite a few pizzerias with wood burning ovens that manage their ovens without turning away customers.

The hostess then told us they were on a 45 minute wait....let me just say, the restaurant was almost totally empty.

Apparently you get a free slice of cheesecake w/ a carafe of wine purchase.  We opt for a Lambrusco bottle and the antipasto to start.  The antipasto is a plate of bread and a plate of literally 4 slices salami, 4 slices mozzarella, 1 basil leaf, roasted red peppers, and 4 green olives and 6 kalamatas.  Not overly in love with this assortment- I could do a better antipasto from my refrigerator.  Where's the prosciutto??  The pizza though!! Thin crust happiness with that authentic chewy New York fold in half style.  The sauce was nice & chunky and even the small pizza is large for 2 people.  I basically went into a pizza coma and forgave the uninspired (though fresh) antipasto!  Pumpkin cheesecake as promised: great flavor and texture to the filling but the crust was soggy.  Maybe it was free because it was frozen or a week old?",

I would have given five stars except for a couple of things that didn't quite make the visit perfect.  First off, we happened to arrive at a time when they were servicing their ovens, which was fine.  I get it.  Sometimes things have to be done to provide a good product.  However, when you say that the wait will be 45 minutes from when you order until you actually get the pizza, make sure it's 45 minutes or less.  Not an hour plus.  Luckily, knowing that the pizza would take awhile, we decided to order a Caesar salad and some bruschetta to enjoy while waiting and enjoy we did.  Both had so much flavor!  Absolutely delicious!  We couldn't wait to taste the pizza.  Instead of building our own, we decided to go with \"The Don\", which is topped with Italian sausage, meatballs, and pepperoni.  Sounds great, right?  Unfortunately, The Don didn't live up to his predecessors.  It was decent enough, but was really lacking in flavor.  I was expecting so much more.  All in all, this location is great.  Our server was excellent.  They have an extensive wine list.  The atmosphere is spot on and would be a great \"date night\" excursion before heading to see a movie. Wish I lived closer...",

    "text": "I used to live about a fifteen minute walk away from the famous Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Heights. It was a little bit of a tourist trap, because everyone knew about it thanks to TV shows, magazines and the \"Best Pizza In America\" award. I went 1 for 5 in my attempts to get in that line down under the Brooklyn Bridge, and the one time I did manage to make it early enough to secure a decent spot, the za was definitely worth the 40 minute wait.   With that in mind, I was pretty intrigued by the prospect of a Grimaldi's pizza without the 2 hour line at the original location. I think, however, that there are forces at work to keep me and a Grimaldi's pizza apart and they have followed me to Phoenix.  This place is f*cking hard to find without a GPS. It's hidden in a shopping plaza across from a movie theater with some of the most understated signage ever.  The service was pleasant enough, and attentive. The antipasti and drinks came to the table right away and I hoped within 15-20 mins our pizza would follow.  20 mins pass. 25. Then 30, then 35. Where the hell is the 'za? People who were seated after I was are being served tasty looking pizzas and I got nothin'.   I noticed that Honey Boo-Boo's family, who were seated a couple tables away from me about ten minutes after I arrived were enjoying a pie that was identical to what I ordered. Shortly after they begin devouring that first pizza, they are presented with another pizza, which is followed by some discussion with their server and what seems to be some sort of apology. As if they had been given the wrong pizza and had begun eating it anyhow.   Yeah, they were eating my pizza. The server had goofed something up, and within 2 minutes brought a pizza to my table that was not at all what I had ordered as if she had a clue.   I asked for my check. The server told me the manager was coming to my table but no one ever showed.  She boxed the pizza up for me (it was mushroom, onion and tomato, not pepperoni as I had ordered, and I'm sorry, but I think putting tomato slices on a pizza that already has tomato sauce is dumb and I am not down to become a vegetarian because you botched my order) and I never did receive a check for it but I did tip her what would have been 20% of the bill.  Poor handling of my case leads me to believe they're all new and learning how to work together, but I can't see coming back to this particular location. Maybe I'll try Scottsdale instead or go to Barro's.  BTW- when it comes to pizza in Brooklyn, it's Carmine's or Lucali hands down over Grimaldi's anyhow.",

    "text": "We arrived at Grimaldi's a little after 9:30pm (they're listed as open until 11pm).  Place was mostly empty, maybe 6-8 tables seated plus a patron or two at the bar.  We stood at the hostess stand for a couple minutes.  When the hostess? returned I asked for a table for 2.  She said it would be a few minutes.  That seemed odd... we were the only people waiting to be seated and there were many empty tables.  We gave her our name, anyway.  She walked away.  As we stood waiting we noticed the empty tables hadn't been cleared from the previous patrons, and it wasn't obvious anyone was bussing them.  Nonetheless, there were several employees basically standing around.  When the hostess didn't return in awhile, I started looking for her...  first she was taking pictures of a group at a table, then she was talking to another table, then she was talking to some other employees. But she was not clearing a table or, it appeared, trying to get someone else to clear a table.   We had been waiting for about 15-minutes at this point.  Eventually I caught her eye and she returned to the hostess stand and I asked what was taking so long.  She said she was sorry and offered us a table next to a loud boisterous group close to the hostess stand.  We asked for a table somewhere away from the noise. We were told it would be a few more minutes, and said she was sorry.  I again asked why this was taking so long, said she was sorry.  I said I noticed she had time to take pictures, she said they asked her to and she was sorry.  I said she had time to talk with others, she said she was sorry.  At that point I pretty sternly said \"stop saying you're sorry... sorry doesn't fix anything.\"  She said she was sorry.  We left and went to another restaurant where we waited about 5-minutes for a table which, coincidentally, it wasn't completely bussed... the hostess wiped it down, set it up and seated us.  Grimaldi's may/may not have excellent food... we'll never know since we won't be returning.  But they would do well to instill in their employees that being \"sorry\" doesn't fix a problem and it's never an excuse for poor service. Action fixes problems.",

Honestly, within an hour I had an upset stomach.... and you know what came next.  I was the only one of our group to order those 2 items, and the only one to end up with an upset stomach.

It's super thin , crusty Pizza that has a lot of cheese and is garlicky. The pepperonis are these miniature little pepperonis that curl up and are so delicious. I always order a large pizza so I have plenty of leftovers. Also they have the best birthday program in town, anyone that signs up will get sent a free voucher for a large pizza around their birthday week. No other purchase required, it's a crazy good deal. I've also tried their barbecue chicken pizza which is seasonal and it's amazing, also their red pizza is delicious as well, probably the best red pizza sauce I've ever had. They don't have many appetizers other than salads but that's okay I'm there for the pizza. I have shared a salad a few times and they have been very good. They also have some amazing cheesecakes for dessert which we usually end up taking home. Every time my parents come to town there is always a trip to Grimaldi's involved. It's also close to a lot of the spring training games and Tommy Lasorda frequents it, I'm told during spring training he is often there a few times a week, I have seen him twice personally myself, he was always very kind and more than willing to take a picture with people.",

    "text": "We come here a lot and we stopped by tonight for a birthday dinner for my wife and I. We decided to dine in and take advantage of our free bday pizza coupon. We had to wait as they were getting a table ready which is no big deal; this is where it went wrong. We sat down and the table was still covered in crumbs from the last table, a plate was dirty, then our sever came over.  She took our drunk order and remove the plate, no apology, no big deal. When she brought the drinks back and took our order she gave a bit of an attitude. Then she got a larger table and we almost never saw her after that, but could hear her schmoozing it up with them. When she finally came back I asked if I could have a beer and a new water as my glass had something in it. She took the glass and again no apology. 10 minutes a later I got my beer which I could see was at the bar waiting and she took numerous drinks from there to her other tables. The beer was like warm at best.  We ordered 2 large pizzas which came at completely different times and delivered by two different people. The pizza, however, was amazing as usual.   We asked for our remaining pizza to go, our server stacked the two pizza tins on top of one another smashing one pizza, and then placing dirty dishes on top of the other pizza. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed it. We didn't take the leftovers. Despite my suggestions my wife did leave a tip.   From now on we will only be getting pizza to go because of this, hopefully anomaly, terrible service. We were so disappointed as we usually get amazing service every time we go.",

She was, professional, attentive and all her recommendations were fantastic. No photos because we ate it before I remembered I wanted to Yelp it! You won't regret trying anything on the menu. Last I had the Brooklyn Bridge, Chef's selection. Wines @ the table, 19 Crimes (Bold Red), Terra D'Oro (Moscato) & Banfi (Sparkling Rose). Hope that helps, Enjoy",

The toppings doubled the price of the 16\" pizza. And like others said, hardly any toppings for the price. And you pay the same for toppings on 1/2 or whole pizza. Anyway $71+ later we were done. Pizza ok but not worth the price. Maybe go back if we get the free birthday pizza.",

We show up after driving 30 min to get an appetizer and order some pizzas with the family to find out they were just about to shut the ocean down at 3:45pm they were just finishing up the last min orders placed online.   The reason they get a 1 star is because the lied I specifically called I knew they would shut the oven down for cleaning and I planned around that time to enjoy some dinner with family come find out they didn't care. The (manager) male, I didn't catch his name offered no help specially after I told him I called and dragged everyone here with a new born baby to dine at their restaurant.   He could of easily taken our order really quick since they had more orders going in the oven to begin with. I didn't ask him to make any expectations just did what his staff suggested to find out I wasted my time so I guess I will go somewhere else and no come here again. Thanks for your no help mr manager you suck and you don't know what customer service is.",

As always the basic Margherita pizza was outstanding in its simplicity.  Nice and thin and not terribly filling - but you will have enough.  Finding the place can be a challenge because it is located on a faux-city-downtown shopping mall.  So you should follow your phone map app closely to locate Grimaldi's. Parking is available out front but is usually taken, so you most likely will have to park around the block in a larger lot.  Not too far of a walk, though.",

My only complaint is that they re brick their oven and the most random times and it's down for like a hour when they do it. So if you go for lunch give them a call and make sure the oven is up running and hot. Lunch special is decent you get a good size Cesar or house salad and a personalized one topping pizza and a soft drink for for 9.95 . Restaurant is always very clean and manger checks on you.   ***** another 5 stars for you guys! Just dined in for dinner. Wait wasn't long for it being Friday about 35 Minutes. They use a cellphone system they call or text when your table is ready. Which is nice because you can walk around the Park West shopping center. Our server tonight was Jake and he was very personable and fast. He was great with kids and their request for the fun dough. Kept our drinks full and was speedy with bar drinks. Salads came out fast cold and crisp. Pizza came hot and amazing as always. Ask for yummie garlic powered it gives the pizza that zing! We will continue to dine in! Keep up the good work guys!",

The 16' classic with pep, bacon, and Italian sausage is amazing! Everything I want in a pie and this was it. The crust, perfect balance of crispyness to bendable for folding. Also, not to thick and I wouldn't call it thin. Just the right amount of sauce and ingredients that taste great and full of flavor. The cheese, and I don't care much about cheese is also freaking perfect because it's not too much but it's there and it's good. I forgot we also had a Caesar salad, can't complain here very fresh. To top off the great food, our server was perfect! If you like pizza, brick oven pizza to be exact...you need to try Grimaldi's at Park West!",

I love the music that they were playing in the background and the lighting in the restaurant was awesome. Now, let's get to the pizza. OMG!!!!! Completely delicious! We all loved the thin crust. It was so fresh too! We had side salads which we really should not have gotten because we were kind of full by the time we got to the pizza. But overall I highly recommend trying this place and if I'm ever back in Phoenix I will definitely go here again",

It was grossly hot in there and no compensation such as free soda or anything for sticking it out. The only reason we stayed after walking in was because the host said the back half the restaurant had air. Nope. Still hot. I would have walked out but we had waited 30 minutes and already had wine in front of us. I may be back, but not until winter when it's nice outside.",

It was big enough for two people to share. Afterwards we couldn't resist the dessert menu. We got the trio of chocolate cheesecake, caramel apple cheesecake, and the cannoli. They were all amazing, but the caramel apple cheesecake was my favorite. Definitely will be going back.",

    "text": "I had heard many great things about this pizza so it was on a high pedestal for reference, and maybe because it was Father's Day they phoned it in, but I don't get to go out and spend $80 on dinner that often (food price only). I wanted to go to Pizzeria Bianco downtown but they are closed on Sunday's. Grimaldi's was stoking the fire, which takes about 45min, but we decided to wait. Ordered a house salad and a caprese salad. Also put an order in for 1sm (16\") regular sauce pizza w/pepperoni for the kids and 1sm white with 4 veggies on it. The price is per topping, even if it's only on half  of the pizza ($2-$4 each).   The house salad had a fly at the bottom, which looked like cracked pepper until my daughter almost ate it (the manager removed it from the bill). The service was terrible, the entire time. She ran behind me when we had outer mouths full and asked how we were doing without stopping. I had asked originally that I would want some wine but wanted to look over the menu, and all the menus were taken along with the glasses when I was in the bathroom. One busboy brought us new plates for the pizza and then another one came, stacked them up and took them away without asking. The waitress couldn't hear us over the din of an empty restaurant, so I felt like I was yelling and she said she didn't hear what I said when I didn't say anything. We were rushed, told not to get larges, which would have worked for us better because we like pizza leftovers and got none, there were no pre-built recommendations and everybody's meat and veggies are different from the next place. I had to cut the large pizza slices for my kids with the butter knife (hard to do and messy, the fork was sharper) because the waitress could not be tracked down. The mozzarella was good, but I've had better. The pizza was good, but I've had better in town. We got a booster seat only after we asked a manager. Sorry all the issues aren't in order, but I keep remembering all the stuff that went wrong while I'm typing and will remember a few more after I'm done. I was so fed up with the service that I didn't order any wine, I just wanted out of there, which took too long because our server was apparently swamped with the other tables.    For the price it wasn't worth it (I feel like deleting the review and repeating that statement for the entire length). My Father's Day dinner was a letdown. The pizza was just OK, the service was something out of the twilight zone.. I'm going somewhere else next time and not going to let people talk about it like it's the best pizza in town.",

    "text": "Walked in the door to the host listening to a server blatantly bitching about something, no acknowledgement, nothing, and another gentlemen with his back to the door who greeted me before the two girls staring right at me!  Our server was a little frazzled, but I am throwing that on tweedle dee at the front who clearly had triple sat her.  The place has a huge acoustics problem.. It was boisterously loud and echoey.  THe layout is really awkward, it is an oddly shaped place and that leads to tables being in odd spots.  We were in some sort of corner of a corner.  I was about to walk out as I was waiting for the hubster to find a parking spot (really tricky at this place on a weekend) and he found a spot quicker than our server greeted us (about 5 min).  But I felt bad leaving after he had spent so much time to find a place to park and we had wanted to try this place... We were actually trying it so see if it would be a good fit for a large (i.e 25 people) party we are planning in November (clearly we have decided against that)  I ordered a beer, I had asked what their draft selection was and she said that they had the Sam Adams seasonal (knowing Sam Adams usually has more than one seasonal at a time, this was as informative as telling me the beer was yellow).  I inquired more and the server said, \"oh, I don't know, its like light you know, definitely lighter than Blue Moon\"  I reply with, \"light in what sense because Blue Moon is not a heavy beer in the slightest bit\" ,( its actually an anti-beer..back in the serving days it is what I would suggest to people who want a beer that didn't usually drink beer). Her reply was \"oh Blue Moon is REALLY strong! So this beer isn't like this!\"  Oh jeez.  Really?!?!  Why I continued to ask for more clarification is beyond me, clearly this girl had never had actual beer in her life.. (having worked at a brewery for eight years, there is an inevitable beer snobbery that kicks in)  But, I have had some REALLY GROSS Sam Adams before (ie. their Winter beer with pine needles...yes, yes, pine needles...it tastes as air freshenery as it sounds)  Anyways, insert 3 more completely incorrect statements about beer later, and I just ordered the damn thing.  It was 118 out the weekend we went, and I just wanted something cold...all else fails I could just down it.  I was very thirsty by time it got to me...8 minutes later-with no head bc it sat at the well so long.  It was the oh so lovely host who brought it (which mind you, didn't look like she was old enough to serve the glass).  While waiting for my food (see below) I ordered a second beer...yeah, that one took so long to get to me it was warm...sigh.  About 30 min later the hubster's pizza came.  Mine, not so much.  Our server did not even acknowledge that my pizza was MIA.  I saw her frantically trying to get the managers attention.  I saw her impatiently talking to the expo. I saw her pacing.  Not once did she say, \"hey it will be just a moment on the pizza\".  Five minutes later she finally gets the manager to acknowledge she needs help.  Manager goes to the line, gets my pizza and delivers it.  Not once does the MANAGER say \"sorry about the wait, etc\".  I bring up the wait.  Her response...HA! \"Oh well, our pizzas are hand made, so they can't possibly all come out at the same time. And your pizza has fresh sausage on it, so clearly it has to cook for longer.  I mean you should see how it is when we have large parties, they never get their food at the same time. It is just how we do things here. You should of expected that for a fresh made pizza\"   WHAT THE HECK?!?!?!?!?! Did that just happen?!?  Oh and your FRESH sausage...it tastes just like the pepperoni on the hubsters pizza...tastes just like Jimmy Dean. Lady, don't patronize me. I worked in restaurants for 13 years, I watched the game happen the second our server realized she forgot to put my pizza in...Don't make up some lame excuse about pizzas can't possibly be ready at the same time for the same table...if that is actually True then you have a very POORLY run kitchen.  Our server was nice, but that didn't make up for the horrible service we got... Only part of it was on her end though.  I asked for a box, server said she would box it...ugh I hate that. What I ended up with was foil very loosely covering my pizza and thrown in a huge bag...umm...really?!?  You're a pizza joint and this is the best method you have for left overs?!  $50 for two pizzas, 2 beers, and a salad accompanied by obnoxious staff and overcooked pizzas....yeeeah no thanks!  Oh and they were rolling silverware outside on the patio... Sucks for the server that does it & I sure hope bugs don't land on the \"clean silverware\".",

    "text": "Compared to some of the incredible local pizzerias we have in Phoenix, Grimaldi's doesn't even come close to showing off the potential of what good pizza can truly be. But, at the same time, in terms of chain pizza, I've found that Grimaldi's is one of the better options. I largely attribute this to their crust. Coal-brick does indeed give their crust a great flavor that you won't find at most places. Emphasizing this is very smart marketing on their part.  I'm not really a fan of \"build your own\" concepts and prefer places that have developed their own creations that you can experience by choice. Unfortunately, aside from a few rare exceptions, you're pretty much on your own at Grimaldi's. Be careful, because if you're the type who likes to dump a lot of crap onto your pizzas, your bill will quickly add up. I've jokingly said that someone should order every topping and create an 86 dollar large pizza just to see how god-awful it would truly be. Although I've found that keeping it simple with a basic pepperoni is all that's necessary.  Service is okay, but I always seem to recollect the time when I went here with a co-worker a few years ago. I asked the server what he would recommend for my pizza. He just looked at me like I asked him to recite all 44 U.S. presidents in chronological order. He had nothing! No suggestions and no guidance! He eventually shrugged and reluctantly stated, \"The chicken is pretty good, I guess...\" Seriously?      We had a terrible experience in Chandler, but that's a different story for a different day.    I'll gladly give them a solid four stars. Yes, there is better pizza available, but in terms of comparable \"chain pizza,\" it's probably one of your better options.",

I love a thin crust that isn't too chewy and this is it. When you first bite into it you get that crunch from the toasted crust which is great. Then the flavors of the sauce and cheeses are really good and fresh. I don't live close but when I'm in the area I will definitely have to visit more often. Cuz this is what real NY pizza is about!",

You'd think, GREAT!  ... but next to us sharing this wonderful enclosed private area was a big party.  The group was celebrating someone's birthday and they were THE LOUDEST GROUP OF PEOPLE we have ever sat next to.  It was so awful I was literally getting a headache.  They were celebrating someone's birthday so it's not like I can do anything (nor should I because why ruin someone's celebration?)

We ordered sausage and my family asked why I ordered pepperoni and sausage. I told them it was the sauce they saw and not pepperoni! We also ordered one with green peppers. It had probably about 1/2 pepper diced and barely got a couple of small diced peppers on each slice. Although our food came fast and hot our server never came back to fill our waters. We were a party of 9 so 20% tipping is mandatory. We always pay 20% if not more as long the service is good however she was definitely not 20% worthy. She was also the bartender so I get she had other jobs to handle but she never once filled our water. Some of us ordered an alcoholic beverages so that helped with our thirst but those who didn't were thirsty all dinner. Yes we could've asked but should not have had too. I brought this up to the manager when I was leaving but all got was a non genuine sorry because he had to. Every time someone says they are not a fan of Grimaldi's I let them know how much I love it but I am starting to see what everyone one is talking about. What a shame.",

We finally got to find out for ourselves what all the buzz was about.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza with a ceasar salad; and I ordered a glass of the house red wine. The salad was a perfectly dressed ceasar--not too much dressing but not so little that you're just eating dry romaine. The pizza was delicious! That crust truly is so crispy and appetizing! And of course the wine was a perfect compliment to the meal. A bit on the dry side with a bit of a bite but delicious nonetheless.  And because I am all about the ambiance of an establishment, I was very impressed with the 'hand' of the table linens. Red and white checked tablecloths with a heavy cotton hand prove this is no cheesy (no pun intended) Italian joint. The table is simply set with just the minimum items needed for your meal.   As for the customer service--from the hostess that greeted us to the waiter, we experienced friendly, professional service. Everyone was kind, helpful and knowledgeable. I look forward to visiting Grimaldi's again in the very near future!",

I have been wanting to for a very long time now. Ive been to the one in Scottsdale and was not that impressed. One of my co-workers told me he has been to this one and loves the pizza here. My curiosity got the better of me so I went.      It was packed so I had to wait about 30 minutes. When I was called I was seated at a tiny little table in the back corner. Not exactly the best seat in the house I have to say. The waiter came over after about 10 minutes and took my order. After another 20 minutes the pizza arrived. It looked good and smelled good and tasted fantastic! I do have to admit this was one excellent pizza. Great sauce, very good crust and just the right amount of grease for flavor. And yes I did say grease. A pizza is not a pizza without a bit of grease to make it taste good.       Even though I had the interesting, \"stoking the ovens\" fiasco the first time I tried to eat here, I will be back. This would be a nice date place on maybe a Thursday or Sunday when it's not so busy. I recommend the pepperoni and sausage. They both had great flavor and really made the pizza. Enjoy!",

However, this place is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a> for several reasons. First, it has a great atmosphere. All the waiters are friendly and attentive, even if you aren't sitting at a table! The bartender Kevin kicks ass. Great sense of humor, and excellent bartender all-around. The pizza is amazing! I had a simple Personal Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Famous Grimaldi's Sauce. Absolutely delicious!   As far as the price goes, I ordered a small caesar salad, a lemonade, and a personal pizza with two toppings and the price came to about $24. This is misleading, because I ate all the food myself, but it could have easily fed 2-3 people.   So in summary, great food, great employees, great price. Check it out, but try and go when its not as busy.",

In all the times I've been here, I've always had great service. Unfortunately, yesterday(6-28-14),  my server was not up to par. Remind you, it was not busy. She did not pre-bus, it took a while before We got what we requested for, rarely checked on us, had some attitude, and condescending. I definitely will make sure I don't have her on my next visit.  If it will help management, she was the server to a party of 9 ppl and a baby, having a baby shower lunch.  However on a previous visit, our server Tommy, well yesterday, he came and visited our table and greeted us with a warm hello.  This was just a nice gesture that our server remembered us.   :)  Keep up the great work Grimaldi's!!!",

After 30 min the server comes by and says they are still woking on it.  15 min latter we walked out with nothing.  This was the  only time we talked to the server and the Manager never came over, even though he could see us seating there bored to death, to explain why they are inept.   Had more conversation with the bus boy as he pickup around us.  Really how long does it take to bake  a 12\" pizza 5 -8 min. Never again, has been 3 years since I was there before and it was so-so then, so it's not gotten better.  Fool me once good for you, fool me twice shame on me.",

If it were not for the service it was overall an ok experience. The pizza wasn't that that good and not good enough to make it worth my money to come back. I also didn't like that toppings were a la carte. The pizza is well overpriced with a large cheese being 16. Toppings being 2 to 4 per topping. So no for pizza instead of a fine dining 5 course meal and wine 5 hour dining definitely not worth my time. The only positive about the waitress was she filled my water. I'm done and out!",

I have two kids and they bring the dough for them to play with while we wait for the order. The wait has never been more than 20 minutes from the time we order to the time we get our fabulous food.

The pizza was adequate and nothing special. All the cheese shakers on the table had spoiled cheese, so that was no good. Also, they put the basil on before they cooked the pizza. That's a no no. In a 700 degree oven it comes out burnt. Did I mention the area we were sitting in had at least 5 flies fying around the whole time? The calzone's looked great, but there was something off. Each person who tasted the 4 calzone's said something was off. The texture was all wrong, the sausage that we asked for was ground up like ground beef and had no taste. Needless to say, except for the kids who enjoyed playing with dough, everyone at our table said they won't be back. Being from Brooklyn and knowing the kind of food Grimaldi's is capable of, we were very disapointed.",

We arrived at 415pm on a Saturday and we were informed by the Host as he drank a soda with the straw in his mouth \"we are stoking, are you familiar with this\".  No, this was the first time we've been here.  Still with the straw in his mouth, \"we have to change the coals out and re-start the fire and this process takes about an hour\".  Ok, we will order an appetizer and wait.  He then said, it will be just a moment while we get your table ready.  I looked around and there were only 3 tables occupied.  About 15 minutes later, he directs us to a table right near where we were standing.  The server took our drink order and offered to go ahead and place the order so we were first in line when the oven was ready.  We ordered a couple appetizers and placed the order.  The small salad was enough for 3 people and the large antipata was enough for 5.  They were wonderful!  We ordered 2 large pizzas & a large calzone- All were excellent!  The meatball pizza was amazing!  The calzone was stuffed full and did not disappoint.  The price was a little high.  Not happy that you have to pay $4-$6 for each additional topping.  When we were ready to go, the server was nowhere in sight.  We finally waived down a Manager and he took our card.  Only then did the Server appear and drop off our bill and say, \"thank you so much for stopping in\".  Again, the food was fantastic, but the service was bad.  And why they would change the coals at dinner time on a Saturday, I'm not sure.  I would go back again.  But I would order ahead and make sure to avoid the \"stoking\" hours.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Grimaldi's today for lunch.  We decided to try this place one more time. Our last visit resulted in my sister biting into a large piece of coal and breaking her tooth. According to the manager this is common and they are supposed to check the pizza for coal before serving. My sister got the run around for awhile before she finally got her tooth looked at by a dentist. The manager wanted my sister to pay for everything and then Grimaldi's would reimburse. She finally was able to get the insurance information for billing, prior to her dentist appointment. This took several phone calls and a lot of frustration on her part.  Today we decided to check the pizza ourself for coal and sure enough my husband found two small pieces in his pizza slice. Our waitress started out waiting tables and ended up behind the bar serving drinks. We had to ask several other waitresses for another, beer, water, etc., because our waitress never came back to our table.  The service was horrible and the food was not worth the wait or the frustration of bad service!!!",

The pizza i just attempted to chew here at Grimaldis at Park West was less than average. The crust was supposed to be the best part and it was not at all. It was so chewy that me and my partner could barely chew it. The toppings were sparingly and they charge for every topping ($2).  I Have eaten at Grimaldis in Scottsdale and it was much better. I would much rather have had pizza hut than this. I love pizzeria bianco and rays of ny. I hope mgr here sees this and figures it out soon.",

First time trying it was over a year ago and it was delicious. I would come back all the time and referred quite a few customers there. I still go about once a week, or every other week. My first bad experience was several weeks ago when I ordered a sliced tomato and mushroom pizza. I was enjoying and was half way finished when I took a bite in something very chewy. It was pepperoni. Now this wouldn't be a big deal at all if eating meat was not against my beliefs. It really surprised me because I had been there so many times and this one time, out of all the pizzas, and all the people who do eat meat, this happens to me. Weird. I complained and the manager came out to apologize and that was it. She just apologized and stood there. It took her a few minutes to offer not charging us for the pizza. It was very awkward. Other that that one bad experience, I still come back. Always. The quality of the pizza sauce is GREAT and everything else is great as well. This pizza is made in the brick oven so it will not be your usual pizza you order from Dominos or Pizza Hut. If you are used to thick, greasy, nasty, low quality pizza, this place is NOT for you.",

I would never go back for the pizza but if I was in the area and wanted cheesecake I would stop in and get it to go. Oh and when hubby and I walked into this place there was about 5 servers or whoever just standing there in a group talking,but when we walked in they just stared at us as we walked to our table,didnt say anything just stared it was really awkward!!!!",

    "text": "Took my wife and the in laws there to celebrate her birthday. We called around 5 pm to see how long the wait time was. We were told that there want a wait and then we asked if we could put our name on the list since we were on our way there. We were told they don't do that and that we would have to put our name on the list once we got there. Once we arrived there was already a 30 to 40 minute wait, which was little frustrating especially after pulling it up on yelp and I saw that I could put my name down on the list to join the line. There isn't much room to wait inside till you are seated which is kind of rough with the heat, you either sweat or snuggle up like sardines inside the front door.   Good Pizza, I normally get The Don which has plenty of meat and sauce for you and the crusty in crispy and tasty. My Waite normally get the white garlic with sausage which she finds tasty but that's not really my flavor but it does look pretty tasty. The 18 inch is plenty of pizza for two if you can agree on the type you would like. Things are a little pricey but if you share some of it then you should be Abel to get a good deal from it.   Overall I would say it's a good place to go for a date, family dinner or just any special occasion.",

    "text": "I kept the place in the back of my mind after seeing a movie across the way a month prior.  It should have stayed in the back of my mind.    As we were approaching the door, you can clearly smell a backed up sewer.  This is no fault of the restaurant but, it was kind of gross and worth a mention.    The server hostess followed by the server greeted us.  Our server asked if we've been here before, since we said no, she explained the niche of New York style pizza and so on.  Our complete order consisted of two iced teas, the caprese appetizer, and of course, pizza.    After a short wait, the appetizer comes out and is delivered to the opposite side to our small table.  This was awkward considering there was enough space next to me and between the person that I was with.    Upon inspection, the presentation was questionable seeing some salt and pepper sprinkled on this.  From New York to California, when ordering this at a restaurant, I have never seen pepper or beefsteak tomatoes used.  The use of beefsteak tomatoes for this was poor judgement for this appetizer and makes it appear that they don't care what they are serving.  Those have their place, but are tough and lack flavor for this.  The 'fresh' mozzarella was far from it.  It was bland and tasted store bought since you can tell that it was sitting in the fridge a while.  On the plus side, fresh basil was used and the only thing that was done right here.    Before I go into the pizza, I get it, but it was rather frustrating having to pay $2-$4 per topping.  The price was a one size fits all, so if you got a small pizza or a large pizza, it was the same price.  Again, I get it.    With that said, we shared a small pizza since we didn't want leftovers.  $12 pizza and then another $8 for 3 different toppings seemed like a lot considering how cheap pizza is to make.    The pizza was decent, but not worth $20.  Being a wood fired oven, you'd think that sauce and toppings would come closer to the edge in an effort to prevent so much burned crust.  Nope.  I liked burnt food, in moderation, so I was ok with this, but pointing this out since others might not be.  Overall, the pizza might have been saved with better sauce since it just tasted like basic tomato sauce and they needed to more generous toppings considering the cost.   Overall, I felt this place was cutting too many corners and skimping where they shouldn't be to save some money.   If changes are made, I'll give them another chance but, at this point, I can't recommend them to anyone.",

We ordered our Caesar Salad which was huge for a small salad. Then we only waited about 10 minutes and our pizza was ready. We kept our pizza simple by just adding pepperoni. The flavors of the sauce and cheese were able to speak for themselves and it was delicious. We have had many Phoenix pizzas and this is one of the best. We also tried the special Reese's peanut putter cup cheesecake. Although simple,it was one of the best meals I have had in a while. Very pleasant experience.",

It's one of the few affordable quality restaurants in the area without having to go down to Westgate (which, even then, is limited). I would recommend stopping here if you're at Park West - it's a good place to stop when you're going to see a movie.  Service is good, haven't had any issues with getting seated in a reasonable amount of time or with our orders.   Seriously though, if that caprese wasn't consistently bad, this would be 4 stars.",

The service was about par with the hostess. She walked passed our table at least 7 times and never taking one dirty plate or refilling a glass) If that's the busboy's job, cool. How about you just pick up the plate to appease the customer (not to mention it was a small as hhheeelll table, so space was a hot commodity), hm?

We ate what we could as we were starving after waiting over an hour. The manager came over and agreed the pizza was burnt..said a new one would only take 8 min... 8 min..why did it take over an hour? Anyways, he took the pizza of the ticket..which was great cause it was not edible.  He did offer a piece of cheesecake which we declined as I could not sit around anymore waiting.

My brother and his wife came into town so we decide to make a reservation and go. It was a Saturday night and we got seated for our reservation pretty quickly. Our waiter immediately notified us that things were really busy and pizza would take over 30 minutes so we asked about appetizers. He said that everything gets cooked in the same oven and they don't use microwaves or friers. So we got some salad to start us off.  Luckily the pizza came and it was pretty good! We even followed it up with some cheesecake afterwards. The four cheese pizza was a little salty to our taste but it was good overall.  Our waiter was great. He checked in with us regularly and kept our drinks topped off.  You will most likely be parking on the side parking lot of Harkins Theatre. There are just a few spaces in front of the restaurant.   This is a cool place to try out. But they may need another oven so they can get food out faster.",

Stay away from the Peoria location, y'all!! The service was absolutely awful!!! We were not greeted with a smile let alone any kindness! We decided to eat at the bar, since the ProBowl game was on, and you usually get better service at the bar... right? SMFH, we sit at the bar, waiting well over 6 mins before Angelica swiftly passes by to say \"I'll be w/you guys in a minute \" ummmm, who are you addressing!??? Then when she finally DOES come to us, she pisses me off by offering me a damn glass of Ghetto ass Moscato! There was a nice blonde couple sitting next to us, I didn't hear her offer HER any damn Moscato! I declined then asked her \"who in the Hell would drink a dessert wine with a Brooklyn style brick-oven pizza!?\" She apologized then said well a lot of people ask for it, me being a smart ass then replied, \" well maybe next time you wait for someone to ASK rather than offer that disgusting crap!\" I noticed it took unusually long for our pizzas to arrive, when they did... miss busy-body hadn't even set up the trays or anything and when I asked the guy that brought it out to do so, he gave more attitude than a queen on RuPaul's drag race!!!! the pizza was cold, and one of my $4 toppings were missing! Although it was cold, it was still good. I hate writing bad reviews, but the entire experience was horrible from the guys preparing the pizzas just an ear shot away from the bar having HIGHLY inappropriate conversations in addition to the fact that the service here was just dreadful!!!!

I asked if they could substitute another item they said no. Coupon expired the next day so the hell with Grimaldi's.",

On The last occasion which I'm updating my review about the pizza left much to be desired even by grimaldis standards, too much sauce, not enough cheese, and FLIES bugging us the whole time.  The service for the most part was good but they constantly got confused about whose order is who, I want to give them 4 stars but after multiple visits and can easily say something is always a little off when we're not being refused service because they're \"stoking the oven.\"  It makes me feel like they give themselves an excuse to slack off when they do that, they desperately need a new oven or maybe just a second oven, not to complicated to figure out if your a successful restaurant one would think.",

My wife asked about the happy hour menu and she said because it was after 6pm that she could not honor anything on the happy hour menu.  I told her that we had been seated since 5:52pm but she just apologized and said there was nothing she could do.  Needless to say, this was very poor judgment on her part and the manager should have comp'd the first round of drinks for the long wait.  Oh well, we probably would think twice about returning because of this.",

This place was super packed but luckily you can reserve your place in line via yelp. Parking is a pain as well. Service was fine but I don't see a reason to come back.

They do have a gluten free crust but when you order a 3 topping pizza and it costs $24.00, you expect to get something larger than a 10\" personal pizza with hardly any of the toppings you requested. Let's talk about the toppings that the pizza comes with. The cheese and sauce may have been a total of 4oz and that is stretching it. The quality of crust was poor. It was a pickup order and the young lady that took the order hung up on me before I was finished. I was displeased from start to finish. I would suggest that if you eat gluten free pizza go anyplace else.",

    "text": "Another pizza chain claiming to be the best from NY. Grimaldis is located across from the Harkins at Park West. The inside always smells like dough and bleach for some reason. The staff is always rude and very short with replies. I went recently with my wife and another couple. They sat us in the very back in an alley like room even though the place was more than half empty. The waitress came out and asked for our drinks. Not friendly or if she was happy to see us. The menu consists of about half a dozen items. No wings or appetizers. Just build your own pizza and some salads.   I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, jalapenos, and mushrooms. I also ordered a large Mediterranean salad. Asked for ranch and the waitress arrogantly replied they don't carry ranch. So I asked for blue cheese and again she smirks that they don't carry dressings. I said, \"Oh, okay thanks.\"  Point taken: I am beneath your level of standards.  Thanks.  The salad was okay. Everything tasted fresh but had a little too much of their balsamic vinegar dressing. And for 10 bucks I could have made a salad that would have stomped a mud hole in that one.   The pizza was a pretty decent size. The edges were slightly burnt and the cheese and sauce were on point. However, for 2 dollars per topping I expect more than 8 slices of jalapeno, 10 slivers of mushrooms, and the tiniest circles of pepperoni that I have ever seen. Not to mention the jalapenos had the ends on them. Yum, that tastes great chewing on jalapeno stems. Thanks Grimaldis!   Then the manager comes by and cant even make eye contact and asks how we are doing. Great thanks. We wont come back here.   The bill comes out to 40+ bucks before tip. For a pizza, salad, and a couple of drinks. Do yourself a favor. Go somewhere that appreciates your business and welcomes you in their restaurant at bare minimum. If you want to drop 40 bucks on a pizza and salad go to Piazza AL Forna, Bianco, La Grande, Spinatos, Oreganos, Cibo...etc...etc...etc.",

However here is where the unprofessional-ism comes in.   After dinner my GF went to the restroom, while in the restroom, a waitress approaches her with a proposition from the Manager named \"Rich\". Stating, \"he wanted to give her his number since he found her so attractive and wanted to know her status with the guy at the table\". This offended her and she declined the offer.   Evidently, this is a common practice by the manager to prey on female patrons as the waitress had no problem assailing her on his behalf. My GF returned embarrassed/offended and wanted to leave immediately; she wouldn't  tell me what was wrong until we exited the restaurant, in order to prevent a scene from occurring.  The manager should really take some classes on business ethics. Patrons are there for the growth of your establishment, not for your own carnal desires.",

I went to Grimaldi's and ordered a pizza for take out. I arrived approximately 4:50 PM the young adult who took my order said the pizza would be ready at 5:25 PM and for me to come back at that time. I went to the bar and ordered a beer and watched their TV. At 5:25 I went to pick up my order and the waiter said it would be a couple of more minutes. A couple of more minutes turned out to be 12 more minutes.  When I finally received my pizza I went to my car to start back to my home and decided to eat a slice. When I took a bite I couldn't believe what all the hype was about their pizza because the pizza that I got the cheese was stringing and it took a while to chew. I wasn't impressed with Grimaldi's pizza especially paying 27 dollars for a small pizza.",

    "text": "AMAZING coal brick oven pizza !! Don't live far from here so when my boyfriend and I feel like eating something good this is our GO TO!!! I hear this is as close as New York pizza as you can get. You walk right in and see the hard working pizza flipping chefs at work through their see through glass. Also try their amazing wine bar or sit outside to enjoy the weather. We order take out and we dine in. There are times when they stoke (clean) their oven so they don't take orders at the time so they usually ask you too wait an hour or so. All the times we have dined in the food has been delicious and their Cesar salad is DA BOMB  the waiters there are very helpful and very kind. We had asked for a pepperoni pizza and we never got them. I brought it to my waiters attention and he came back with a BOWL of pepperoni. I WAS IN LOVE! Pepperonis are my favorite  and did I forget to mention their Antipasto ??? Comes with salami, peppers, DELISIOUS fresh mozerlla, olives, and slices of bread. Must try and MUST VISIT. I hope this reviewed helped. Enjoy",

    "text": "My significant other and I were in town this weekend to visit with friends. We had limited time and needed to have our favorite pizza. Since moving to Seattle/Tacoma area, we have not had anything near as good as Grimaldi's. We decided we would post on Facebook to let our friends know where we'd be if they wanted to meet up with us. When the head count reached 12 we thought we better make reservations. Before lunch was over, we had a party of 26!!! The staff at Grimaldi's was so accommodating of our rather large and unexpected group. And, as always, the pizza was the best. Thank you so much for making our reunion lunch so wonderful. I only wish we had ordered a pizza to go to bring back to the Pacific Northwest, I'm hungry for more.",

The pizza is amazing (pepperoni and jalapeno being our family favorite) and its always made perfectly with the right amount of toppings but the reason I can't give 5 stars is because I can't understand why the bathrooms are so small!!! Three people can not even fit in their comfortably, I like to wash my hands without reaching over people so that's why I have to give 4 stars. If the bathroom was spacious it would definitely be 5 stars!!! But service and pizza are amazing!",

The wait at this location is ALWAYS lengthy, and the food is not so good that it feels worthwhile. The hostess team on 11-29-14 seemed particularly ill-prepared to seat people efficiently, and they were thoroughly confused when our name was called.  Our table for two was ready. . . . but it really wasn't. . . . After more waiting, we were offered a table outside (which is precisely what we asked not to have); we took it because we were hungry. On the positive side, the manager did seem to try to please guests on a busy night, and our server was extremely pleasant and attentive. (I wish I could remember her name) The pizza was very tasty, and our salad was also good.  Beverages were refilled promptly throughout the evening. The bread leaves a lot to be desired; far below the offerings of other mid-scale Italian establishments. Again, 3 stars seems harsh, but 4 may be a bit generous in light of the wait and confusion leading up to our being seated.",

The waitress was very kind and prompt with our drinks and salad.  But our pizza was another story. Other customers who arrived after us received theirs before us. After 45 minutes of waiting I asked the waitress for a discount because I felt they were taking too long.  10 minutes later the manager came out and apologized and told us the pizza was on them.  And shortly after that the pizza arrived. All the kids shouted FINALLY!!  Lol the waitress kept apologizing which I respected!  And the we all dug in. The pizza was delicious and the crust was amazing.  I would have given 5stars but the wait was reDICKulous   But over all we loved it and I wouldn't mind going back and trying it out again even though I feel like the price was a little bit too much per topping I feel like it was worth it.",

Turns out our order was lost  (it happens) but our dinner was on them and still great pizza. Third visit. Valentines Day around 3 pm, Ovens are being cleaned and no pizza until an hour later. Talked with manager on my disappointment and left. Fourth time today 4/17. Arrived at 4:45 pm and ovens being cleaned again and no pizza till around 5:20 pm. Reason for my disappointment this time is I gave them another shot, drove out of my way because wife wanted pizza. Sorry Grimaldi's but the way you conduct business I will not return even if you offered a $100 gift certificate. Point is people go out of their way to do business with you and when a customer walks in expects to be seated, pizza ordered and food arrive in a reasonable time and not have to be informed that, sorry we can't make your pizza right now.",

    "text": "This Grimaldi's is A~OK if your in the area looking for good pizza.  I usually rave about one of the other Girmaldi locations to my friends and since we were in the area we thought, why not try this Grimaldi's.  After all it's a Girmaldi's and the Patsy Girmaldi's in DC Ranch taste a like the Girmaldi's in New York.   We were a little concerned when we arrived since this place was very slow and it was during peak lunch time.  The service was ok not exceptional but good. I usually don't have to ask for a refill on my beverage at the other location, but here I did twice...  The decor of this Grimaldi's is very nice.  I found myself starring at the ceiling more than once thinking: \"better not bring my bride here; she'll want me to do this to our ceiling in the den\"!   Lunch~ antipasto salad. The fresh mozzarella was very good, oven roasted sweet red peppers were too cold and not seasoned, the salami was sliced very thin and offered only four pieces (lacking), some olives and some fresh baked bread.  The mozzarella and bread were the stars of this dish ~ everything else let you wanting more or something different.  Personal pizza ~ white garlic with fresh tomatoes.  For the first time ever I had to add salt to my pizza, what the heck? The crust was full of the deliciousness goodness I'm used to at Grimaldi's, crispy and scrumptious but the white cheesy and garlicky toppings needed more seasoning...  The calzones my colleagues had were delish and they ate everything in sight including the left over sauce from their calzones.  I would come back again but for dinner not lunch.  The bar area seemed to be the place to be in this location. This is where you want to sit so you can watch the pizza dough flying before they load it into their brick oven, have some beer or wine but order a different kind of pizza!",

    "text": "I came here on a strong recommendation from a friend. After reading the reviews, I was anxious to try it out. I went on a Saturday night, half expecting it to be really busy. We were seated in about five minutes or less. Not busy on a Saturday night...made me kind of worried.   The menu is sparse, it made ordering really easy.  Service was fairly slow considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. Refills were slow, service was kind of inattentive but not rude. Our pizza came out in about 15-20 mins. We ordered a white with garlic with pepperoni and sausage. The pizza looked and smelled delicious, but that's where it all went bad.  First off, the pizza crust was really soggy because of all the grease under the pizza. I have never ate such a greasy pizza in my life. i had to drain every single slice, it literally created a puddle on my plate. There was a significant lack of sauce on my pizza, some parts of my crust were bare, not even a hint of red on them. The pepperoni and the sausage tasted great and there was enough toppings on the pizza to justify the $2 price tag.   The non soggy areas of crust were great, and the cheese was amazing. We ended up taking half the pizza home, the slices were filling. The pizza was better the next day, after the box absorbed most of the grease, after throwing away the pizza box, the bottom of the box was saturated in grease. I'm not sure if grease makes a quality pizza, but in this case it just made a soggy crust.  **Update** Under intense pressure I came back here and tried a white with chicken, they seriously redeemed themselves. I spoke to the manager and he insisted my last time was a fluke and should have been corrected. I would come back on occasion.",

A little more pricey than average pizza place but the service and added elegance (table cloths, cloth napkins) made it worth it!

But here's the bonus; there's great service and a nice italian diner atmosphere. Located conveniently next to a Harkins Theatre it's a wonderful date location as well. As long as they don't tweak that wonderful pizza this Italian isn't going to change his opinion(Fact, it's a FACT that there pizza is delicious ;)",

He was personable, funny and just all around a great server. I tried the calzone for the first time, because I already know their pizza is awesome and so is the caesar salad. Not a fan of ricotta cheese but I really enjoyed this. We eat at this restaurant more than any place in town. It's also in  a great location, next to Harkins and lots of shopping. I do recommend this place. Thanks Grimaldi's, see you again very soon.",

Tirimisu is pretty good, the canoli we did not care for, I have had a couple canolis and liked them but the filling in this one was very thick custard corn starchy like to me, if they changed it to a light cream it would be great.

The manager came over to me right away and apologized and offered to buy me a drink at the bar. I enjoyed a drink and was attended to by the very pleasant bartender.

This will be the last time I ever set foot in this restaurant. We have had nothing but issues the last few times we have gone here and the only reason we go is our son's birthday and it's where he wants. No more. The issues all stem from extremely awful management IMO. We have gone twice,at 2 different times, to only be told after being sat that there are no pizzas available (oven restocking). Thought we timed it well the second time since it was a different time of day, thought wrong I guess. All with the most recent screw up, they forgot an ordered pizza, the third time in a row BTW, and behaved as if it was our doing they didn't cook it. Look I get it that mistakes happen but own up to it please. The manager handled the entire situation as if \"oh well we forgot your pizza and you'll just wait the extra time while the rest of your party finishes eating\". Yes she eventually comped it, as she should, but only after I commented. My favorite part, after the pizza finally arrives the manager comes by and asks \"how's the pizza\", you mean besides 30 minutes late and after everyone else is finished eating??",

This pizza does not need many toppings because the cheese and crust are both delicious. The cheese is slices of fresh mozzarella, which I love. The pizza is never soggy or burnt. The only negative about grimaldis is that the prices are a little high. It's $22 for a plain pizza and toppings vary from $2-3 each. Good thing I don't like a lot of toppings on my pizza! They also are always very busy so make sure you either plan ahead or go earlier in the day. Love this place!!!",

Trying new things is hard for my boyfriend but he agreed! We chose Grimaldi's and ended happy with our pizza but disappointed with the service. My boyfriend only likes to make half pizzas with certain toppings and I already feel bad enough making it seem hard for the workers. But it should not be a big deal. The entire time my boyfriend was having anxiety because of the cooks staring at us. I knew it had to do with the toppings or whatever the problem was. Everyone was just staring. Making remarks. The girl that brought out our pizza was really rude. Making small remarks about how many toppings were on our pizza. We ended up leaving early because of how uncomfortable we felt. our server was super nice to us and we left a good tip. I wish it was the same for the others.",

We luckily got in right away, were seated at an intimate low light table, and received immediate service. We ordered the caprese and a 12inch create your own (6 slices) and we left full. They have a large menu of wines and a full bar. My favorite part that will have me coming back? 1. The CRUST! it's thin but has an amazing texture and taste. 2. The staff. Our waiter was so accommodating and happy to answer our questions. We will be back with our kids or even our next date night! Keep up the great work!",

The wait was about 40 min because it was very busy but went surprisingly quick. When we were seated our server greeted us friendly but it did not seem genuine and he just seemed like he was going thru the motions. He brought out our drinks and quickly took our order and was quick in bringing out our Salad.  The pizza arrived within 10-15 min and was cooked well and tasted really good. Our server did check on us frequently and like I said was pleasant but just seemed like he had a long day but I guess it's understandable. The coupon I had was not working but to his credit the server informed me that the manager took care of it and honored the coupon. Overall a good experience and my small issues were nothing to warrant a negative review because in general the food and service were good but could have been a little more with a smile and not let the frustration of a long day be noticeable. I would and have returned because the pizza and calzones are worth the little inconsistencies.",

My problem is that last time we were in celebrating a special occasion we received less than mediocre service starting from not getting refills in anywhere close to a timely manner and when asking about it the server still forgot more than once. We also asked for the leftovers to get boxed and we were reassured it would be brought out, yet we paid the bill and waited awhile still no follow through. We had to ask another employee to grab it. Hopefully it was just an off day.",

    "text": "This place totally makes up for the other pizza place that unfortunately shares the same name as this place, but has absolutely no affiliation (thank goodness).  First off, I have to say that the two times I've been here, I haven't once paid for the actual pizza, because if you sign up your birthday, you're given a coupon by e-mail for a FREE PIZZA.  Extra toppings are extra charge, of course.  So  if you haven't tried this place yet and don't know whether you should spend your money, sign up to get a coupon on your birthday.  I'll definitely spend my money for a pizza even without a coupon.  The crust is thin and crispy, with just enough chew to it so it doesn't taste like a cracker with toppings.  The coal firing gives a wonderfully smokey flavor to the pizza, and leaves yummy bubbles in the crust.  So far we've done half pepperoni and half meatball.  Meatball you say?  I admit I've never had meatball on a pizza, so I couldn't help but picture golfball sized meatballs atop a thin slice harnessed in place with strings of mozzarella.  I know, I know..they Slice the meatballs, silly.  I'm normally not a big fan of pepperoni, but this stuff was surprizingly meaty, slightly spicey, and not too oily.  The meatballs though...the meatballs are my favorite.    Top everything off with great service (people that actually know their stuff), a fully stocked bar (with beer sporting the name of \"the Kilt Lifter\"), and nice cozy atmosphere.  I have been back, and I will be back.",

It is way overpriced for what you get. When you have to order EXTRA cheese to BARELY cover the pie with cheese.... this is not acceptable! They offer EXTRA basil at a charge, the pie comes standard with 3 crumbs of basil. The pie is relatively tasteless, the sauce is weak! About the crust, it is good but the center of the pie remains SOGGY even on a pie with only one extra, i.e. sausage (excuse me sausage CRUMBS). This has been the case 3/4 visits.  These comments are based on my FOURTH visit about 2 weeks ago, it is without a doubt my LAST! Mario's Pizza in Surprise/El Mirage puts this place to shame!! He provides a decent NY style pizza devoid of pretense.",

The place wasn't busy so the pizza came quickly. My friend and I split the Carmel toffee cheesecake that was divine. I would recommend this place and will go again.",

A friend took me and my wife to this place and told me that they actually are from New York and they were first having trouble getting the pizza to taste authentic when they first got to Arizona, but they found out it was because of the water here. So they actually used purified water for the dough. It just shows you the detail that goes into making their pizzas. They can even tell you what wine goes with which pizza. pretty cool.",

The dough was undercooked and for some reason there was small pools of water on the surface of the pizza. However I don't remember ordering ice cubes as one of my toppings. Toppings are ridiculously expensive 3 dollars for sausage, 4 dollars for peppers and so on. These prices would have been live-able had there been toppings covering the entire pizza, however, to our disappointment one slice was almost entirely covered in Grimaldi's signature sub par sauce with no toppings to speak of. Waitress however was friendly.",

Nothing could have been further from the case when we went to Grimaldi's at Park West. The service was awful , taking an inordinate amount of time to take our drink order then serving me the wrong drink , then taking over 40 minutes to deliver a small pizza and a personal Pizza to the table.  Pizza just isn't that hard to get right. But Grimaldi's has missed the mark almost entirely. What they served was poorly cooked substandard ingredients on what I can assume was some kind of flatbread crust that was the consistency of fiberboard.  Unless you are a thin crust aficionado you will not get anything remotely resembling pizza at this restaurant, and the food in general is not worth the price Kama which is exorbitant! For a small pizza, a personal pizza and 1 Fountain beverage our bill with tip was $53.   I didn't complain to the management because I was late for a movie , mostly due to the slow service.  It was the only place open at 9 p.m. it was close enough to the theater where we had a shot at making our film. We should have just eating popcorn. My recommendation is to avoid this place like the plague.",

They are good no doubt but something special about Grimaldi's is their toppings.  In particular, their ricotta.  I have no idea how they do it, it's mesmerizing!  It's smooth, it has a sweet nutty flavor and it is perfect.  We've been multiple times with friends and have gotten them to catch the ricotta bug as well.  Last time in there our table ordered 4 pizzas All with added ricotta and when the manager helped deliver them he remarked on this must be the table that loves ricotta.  Yes we do!!  I'm addicted to their ricotta especially on the Don.  Bellissimo.     Their salads are great as well.  Have never had dessert but maybe someday I'll try (if I can add ricotta) :p",

Go in the main enterance and turn right, you can't miss it.  The only crappy thing was finding parking near by.  The street parking was all taken and the dirt parking lot was so chaotic that people were parking in areas that were blocking other cars in.  But being willing to walk just a few feet extra and you'll find parking.  There was plenty of seating outside and and equal amount inside.  I went on a friday night and was seated right away.  I ordered a pretty plain cheese pizza but it was delicious.  The only down side was it felt like forever that it took to make and bring us our personal pan pizzas.  Once we had them things were good.  I would have no problem returning here and getting more delicious pizza.",

They said they could only do that if I ordered it to go but I wanted to sit down in the restaurant and have a beer. They said that was not allowed.

The tomato sauce also had decent flavor.  What I didn't enjoy was paying for each topping I wanted.  It can go from a $10 pizza up to a $20 pizza easily... and this is for a small 12\" pie!

Parking wasn't bad and it was easy to walk in and pickup and pay for the order. They leave the box open so you can make sure you're getting what you paid for which is nice. We paid and took our pizza home.    We ordered a traditional pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. The pizza was perfectly cooked. Crisp crust not burnt and plenty of mini pepperoni and mushrooms. The sauce and cheese was the perfect amount as well. It has been a LONG time since I have had pizza so this pizza tasted like the most delicious thing on earth. The best pizza I think I have ever had. The slices were big so we cut all of the pizza slices into 2 pieces. The hubs and kids really loved the pizza as well although the kids didn't care for the \"spinach\" on the pizza. Noted. We will get it without the basil next time lol  We will be getting pizza I am sure in the future when the occasion arises!",

    "text": "It was my first time visiting a Grimaldi's and I have to say it was incredible!  My servers name was Brian who I think was also the bar keep; he was so friendly and engaging it made the experience even better! I ordered the lunch special (Monday through Friday from 11-4 I believe) which I got a house salad, the 'Brooklyn Bridge' 9in pizza, and a glass of passion fruit ice tea for just $9.99! You can do any specialty pizza for the $9.99 and a house or ceasar salad with a fountain drink or ice tea. If you want a normal pizza it is just $9.49 for the same combo.  The salad was definately above average. It was well cut and cleaned and well dressed also.  Now the pizza... WOW! Absolutely incredible. The crust was the perfect level of crispy yet soft. On the pizza it had the most incredibly creamy cheese and very nice roasted peppers with italian sausage I do believe. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is scared of a very complex pizza or a lot of toppings, it's far superior to any normal pizza you will have in your entire life.  The Ice tea was very good. It's does not come sweetened and it does not need it. It has a great amount of flavor and sweetness naturally with the passion fruit. The cheesecake is made fresh in house and I got the strawberry cheesecake and I have to say from the presentation on the plate, to how soft yet firm it is, absolutely would recommend. The cheesecake is $6 and worth every penny after eating such a great meal.  I believe it is called Grimaldi's Coal or something along those lines, but basically you donate $5.00 or $10.00 to however much and they give you a card that says the amount donated and you get that amount taken off your next bill.  The donations go to feeding starving kids, it says that a $5.00 donation feeds up to 50 kids. There is nothing like eating amazing food and getting to help feeding starving children at the same time!  Great experience and will definately be returning soon!",

The crust was perfectly cooked and delicious. My only complaint for my pizza was the little Hormel brand looking pepperoni. They were just not what I was expecting. The dessert trio was excellent but I should have just stuck with the amazing coconut and caramel cheesecake. It was to die for. Tasted exactly like a girl scout cookie. The restaurant was clean and inviting with friendly staff and great Rat Pack-esque music. My bill was expensive but worth it!",

    "text": "First, make sure you go early so you don't have to wait.  We did a Saturday and got there about 4:30 and there was plenty of seating.  They don't have a big menu so the choices are easy.  All pizzas are thin crust, but there's a good selection of toppings.  We did the Mediterranean Salad adding grilled chicken (for $4).  It might have been 1/2 a chicken breast cut in 6 slices for $4.  Not worth the price, but the salad was very good.  Their vinagrette was exceptionally good.  Now for the pizza...  There's better in town.  Federal Pizza comes to mind, but in the west valley, you have very few choices, so Grimaldi's is ok.  We ordered the margarita pizza adding fresh garlic & prosciutto.  It came out perfectly done, but the slices are humongous, too big to handle, and somewhat soggy in the middle.  There wasn't even a hint of garlic flavor and we didn't really even see any on the pie.  Usually prosciutto is a great topping to add that salty flavor, but this pie was salty enough all by itself, so the prosciutto put it over the top salty.  If you prefer margarita pizza with sliced tomato, this is not you pie.  They only use sauce which to me is a cop-out, but to each his own.  3 stars for the pizza.  The service was very good.  Kudos to Ali behind the bar and her male counterpart.  Both were very attentive and helpful, thus the total of 4 stars for the entire experience.",

He put the manager Mike on the phone who said \"absolutely not\". \"We can't cause it's a corporate rule\". Bullshit. It's a franchise so they could do whatever they wanted. I asked the manager straight \"so you're going to lose a party of seven ?\"  He said yep. Their pizza is so good but I won't go back based on principle.

Got an immediate e-mail confirmation letting me know they were busy working on my order.  Drove to the location just before they said it would be done.  The location was super busy which was a good sign.  My wife and I parked and then went inside.  The line to be seated was going out the door, but thankfully, we ordered ahead!  We were immediately assisted and our pizza was produced.  They lift the top of the box so you can be sure what you're bringing home which is a nice change of pace.  I paid, exited with my pizza and headed back to our new home to devour this beast.  We ordered an 18\" Don.  Arizona isn't exactly well known for its pizza.  It's not like the east coast.  It just isn't.  Tacos are another story, but pizza?  I just don't think of Arizona when I think of pizza.  Sorry.  I was pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite.  The sauce is prepped by hand.  Very flavorful!  The mozzarella was as fresh as could be.  The pepperoni and meatballs on the pizza were delicious. The pizza crust is light, airy and also flavorful.  It didn't stick to your gut like some pizza crusts out there which I really enjoyed.  It left me full and satisfied without feeling like complete shit.  You know the feeling I'm talking about, right?  The one where you reach for the remote controls of your Roku and TV and just beach yourself like a giant sperm whale on your sofa.  Yeah, this pizza totally doesn't make you feel that way which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Highly recommended!  So far, these guys are winning on my quest to find the bestest and tastiest pizza here in the desert.",

The Greek salad had such awesome flavor; my hubby actually loved it and he doesn't usually eat green food! Lol it was a bit pricey but I actually tried to buy all the items and make my own at home the other night and it was close to the same price for less food! Service is fabulous! Nya is our favorite. great at what she does, sweet, and fun. All around had a great time. We will be back!",

The salad had 2 olives, a few pieces of red pepper & a bowl full of romaine lettuce.  You had to pay extra for the pepperoni & kalamata olive which would have been ok but each slice had 2-3 small pepperoni's & 2 pieces of olives.  People were waiting to get in & they had several empty tables & lots of staff hanging around as 1 pizza at a time seemed to come out of the oven.  I should have never missed an early evening at Oregano's for this.  My 1st trip to Grimaldi's will be my last!",

    "text": "On our way home to So Cal, we decided to stop by Grimaldi's in Peoria, since it was both closer and not out of the way, like the Scottsdale one. The last time we were in town, Kathy first tried the one in Scottsdale and just died and went to pizza heaven. I agreed with her as we had it before leaving for home. An interesting note: the one in Scottsdale points to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patsygrimaldis.com&s=bac5928a8f10d8ea307598e794d141ad0af9c4087ac951545138b2c51f6b8164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">patsygrimaldis.com</a> and the Peoria one just points to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grimaldis.com&s=0ffd2abd3534758d159c6707e5ad66557b73feb54795a1345e70036233503ff2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">grimaldis.com</a>. I'll need to ask...  We had to take a detour off of Northern, since there was street work being done from out direction. When we finally got there, Grimaldi's was in a new shopping complex that looked like an outlet. The restaurant was facing the movie theatre and it started to rain while we walked in. We sat down and put in our order immediately, since we were dying hungry and didn't want the back and forth. Our usual: Pepperoni, onions and garlic. A nice blend of salty, sweet and savory. Kathy also ordered the mozzarella, tomato and basil salad. The mozzarella tasted store made and not hand made. The waitress did confirm that a company made the cheese just for Grimaldi's.  When the pie did come out, it smelled divine and was just as good as I remember it to be. Kathy thought that the Scottsdale location made a better pie, but I think she is going off of euphoria. The crust was kissed by the coals, thin and crispy. As thin crust pizzas goes, Grimaldi's is head of the class. Pizzeria Bianco is in a class of its own, but that is an another review...  We devoured our pie and I made sure to leave room for tiramisu. I am a maniac when it comes to tiramisu and was very pleased when I dove into the fresh tiramisu on drizzled chocolate. SO fricken good! Chased it with restaurant quality coffee. I can't think of a better way to end a meal.  I found out that the father, Patsy, owned the original Brooklyn location and the son branched out to Florida, Arizona and other states. The name was changed to Grimaldi's from Patsy Grimaldi's after the dad retired.   Overall, if you want a slice of New York pizza, outside of New York, Grimaldi's is your best bet. It only 6 hours from So Cal, but worth the drive...Stay hungry, my friends and good eatings!",

We go in and even though the place is empty we are sat in a tiny dark corner and left to look at our menus. We sat for about 10 minutes and then we had to get up and go over to the several girls standing at the hostess stand and asked where our server was, after another 3 minutes or so he finally showed up and took our drink and food orders, the food took some time but did show up. It was good and I liked the brick oven taste it had but then they messed up on (and again took forever) to get our dessert order. We only saw our server once, no refills offered on our drinks and it was all together a horrible experience, and late 10 min to our movie. Next time we will go over to toby keith's place a short walk up instead!",

The server suggested a bruschetta. Man it was great. My 4 yr old and wife both wanted a pepperoni so we got one one those also. It was very good.  My wife said it was the best pizza she has ever eaten.    Very good service and I loved the atmosphere. I really like the fact that the menu is very small. I have always been of the opinion, do what you do best and excel.   It was pretty expensive though. It was almost $50 for 2 pie's, 3 soda's and tip. We did have plenty to take home. We wont be eating there that often as money is kinda tight. Takeout would be quite a bit more affordable so that's a good option.",

I went to pick up my large pizza and a salad. I saw my pizza come out, I saw two guys opening the box,  looking at the pizza and discussing something. One guys comes over to me, quickly opens the lid and says \"isthisok?\" (yup all in one word.) I said \"uhh yeah, I guess so\"... \"but wait it looks a little small to be a large.\" He says - oh yeah it's between a medium and a large, but we will give you your salad for free. So, if I would have said \"yes, it looks fine,\" they would have left me walk out of there with something less than what I paid for?! Plus now I have a pizza that will not fill up my family? When I ask for a new pizza he grudgingly says \"well its gonna take 20-25 minutes.\" So, I leave... with a small pizza and a crappy wilted salad... and don't expect anyone to hold the door for you either... they are all too busy gabbing around the guest kiosk.  Ps- this is the 2nd time my order was messed up and I must say even Domino's and Pizza Hut have never messed up my pizza size or toppings!",

I was shocked that the menu offered only salads, pizza, calzone, and a couple dessert options.  No appetizers, no pasta.   I always like to see what other customers are eating.  Most had salads, and all looked delicious.  We had the antipasto which was alright.  Rather bland with the exception of the kalamata olives.  Everyone was eating pizza.  All looked good and greasy.  We had a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  The cheese was good, and the sauce was real sauce!  My dad said, \"This pepperoni is some serious meat!\" And my mother had heartburn in the first 5 minutes.    Even though there was more than enough staff, our drinks sat empty for quite awhile.  Our table exchanged \"where'd the waiter go?\" glances and a manager must have had radar for this.  She immediately appeared at our table and refilled our drinks, boxed our pizza, brought our check and ran the credit card.  I give that lady 5 stars.  On the funny side- there was a girl \"working\" (could never tell what she was actually doing) who looked like a younger version of Tabitha from Tabitha's Takeover (show on Bravo).    Little things: Restroom was clean!  We sat near the front and heard the telephone ring multiple times.  The brick pizza oven is in the middle of the restaurant and you can watch the guys toss pizzas.  I wouldn't avoid the place in the future, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again.",

I especially love the pictures of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. The service was really good. The food is not great but really good.

    "text": "Pizza was fantastic! We got a large Pepperoni, Meatball, Sausage, Mushroom, and Olive pizza and it was some of the best New York style pizza I have had. The large was just enough to fill us up. Another group at our table got a different pizza and it was watery and cheese was really gooey, so it might be hit or miss. Service was good. Our waiter came over to our table just enough times to get us a couple refills and our check. Our hostess was very nice and kept checking in on us, asking if we wanted drinks or to look at a menu, while we were waiting for our table to be ready. For a large pizza and 5 beers we paid $50, so it was a little pricey, but not to bad.",

I walk into this location for the first time, I can honestly say it's a mixture of ambiance between The Olive Garden and a typical pizzeria. The moment I walked in I was greeted and seated. The service may be described as polite and respectable.   The food items ordered were a small pizza and a Mediterranean salad. The pizza had a THIN crust with mostly ingredients being the key volume piece in the pizza. The salad was delicious, fresh and filling.   Thank you Grimaldi's for making pizza an eatable food once again without the fear of endless bread enhancers! I no longer feel guilty for eating pizza and PREFER Grimaldi's thin crust over any other pizzeria's pizzas.   Great service, beautiful location and delicious food, five stars without a doubt :)",

The personal cheese pizza is $9.99 but I had to pay $8 for just 3 toppings, but once I got to eat it, it felt it was well worth the price.  I would definitely recommend it to pizza lovers.",

They recommended that the pizza be cooked for an extended amount of time because of the wet ingredients which caused the crust to be slightly burned with a tad too much crunch for my tastes.  Plenty of staff inside.  Interior atmosphere was o.k.  The only markdown I give them is the price. It seemed to lack value and was over priced.  Probably will not return given it is too far away from me...and even if there were one closer, other places would get my dollar first.",

It is big enough to serve four people with a little extra for who is hungry.  That would be me.  Romaine lettuce, olives, feta cheese onions etc.  The dressing is very light and refreshing.  For pizza, we order two personal sized pizzas and that feeds four people with a little extra for who is really hungry.  That would be me AGAIN.  This pizza goes down easy.  It's great tasting pizza with delicious sauce, fresh toppings, and thin crusts that do not leave you bloated with dough.  The wait staff remembers my family and we are greeted when we enter and throughout the course of our dinner.  A past waiter will always drop by to say hello.  The wait staff are very attentive and are True professionals.  This Grimaldi's location is in the new Park West shopping center.  Check it out.  This location gets packed on the weekends and week nights draw a respectable crowd.  Grimaldi's is one of the reasons.",

I'd heard good things from family members, and last week the opportunity finally presented itself.  The first thing I noticed is that their lobby is virtually non existent, tons of people huddled around the hostess podium with a wait upwards of 30 minutes.  To be fair it's about 6:30PM on a friday and they have a bar, but the bar is completely full as well. many patrons were waiting around the edge of the glass enclosed kitchen in the middle of the restaurant which I found odd.  When we finally got seated our waiter greated us promptly with what seemed like a very \"forced\" brooklyn accent, \" Ya Evah Been Heeyah Befo,... It's Good Pie\" pleasantries aside he was very prompt and took good care of the table.  He even gave my neice who was with us some pizza dough to keep her occupied.  I ordered an individual red sauce pizza with with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom.  They have 3 different sauces, red, white and pesto.  The pizza came and was actually very good, the mozzarella was the fresh kind, not too much cheese, the sauce was a thick puree without being chunky. the toppings were very fresh, everything in sliced form, even the sausage. definitely need a fork and knife to eat this. supposedly it was a 12\" pizza, but being new york style it was very thin, and I was actually kind of surprised I finished the whole thing.  All in all not a bad restaurant, not a bad pizza and I would go back.",

I was able to get a 'lunch size' pepperoni pizza for $5.49 and a Pepsi for $2.50. Grand total? $7.99+ .73 tax = $8.72   I can't eat at Wendy's or Arby's or Long John Silvers this cheaply and Grimaldi's tastes much better is much fresher!  Grimaldi's doesn't advertise this lunch special. I have no idea why. It's a nice little secret value if you know about it. The lunch size pizza is smaller (9\") and much cheaper than the personal pizza (12\") offered on the normal menu. You aren't going to be stuffed by it, but you won't be leaving hungry, either. It's the perfect portion size for one person at lunch, in my opinion.  Of course, the staff are always great and the restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere (everything I mentioned in my previous review still applies.)",

My oldest wanted pizza for dinner, I told my Husband the idea and he had heard of this place from a friend of ours who takes his family all the time. So that said a lot knowing the kind of nice places he enjoys going to.   We had high expectations because of the friend who referred us to check Grimaldi's on Northern out.  I liked that we were able to add ourselves to the wait list from the Yelp app, it even gave us a timeframe and sent me a text right after thanking us and asking that we check in upon arrival.  We got there and checked in, waited about 10 min for a table. They were busy (Friday night), Lots of big groups that night, some birthdays etc. Once we were seated our waitress was super nice and got us all drinks right away. Our boys, 4, 3 & 1 year olds loved getting the pizza dough to play with. Edible fun!  My husband ordered an IPA, and then had a Peroni, and I had a glass of their wine they created that pairs well with The Don pizza. Very good! This style of pizza is wood fired, definitely not your basic chain pizzas, more of an artisan kind of pizza. Crust is crispy, their sauce has great flavor, apparently they're known for their famous sauce.  Our boys ate nearly all of their cheese pizza, we ate all of The Don, well, I had two slices, my hubby ate the rest. That's a good sign. :) I also ordered the Ceasar salad, the small is big. Enough to share with 2-3 people.  We got some desserts to go, tiramisu, a couple canolis and a chocolate cheesecake. The family loved all the desserts. I'd say the tiramisu is one of the best I've had. Yum!  Overall, we loved this place, food was great, drinks were quick, filled and good, the atmosphere was relaxed and laid back but definitely had a nice family & enjoy yourself sort of feel with some big groups and college football playing on the tv's near the bar.  I think we've found a nice new spot for the fam. I'd also like to go back with just the Husband for a fun dinner at the bar. If you come here, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Is this exactly what New York pizza is like? It's sort of close, but not exactly. Apparently, the secret to True NY pizza is in the water. Being that it's 2000 miles away, I don't expect them to import that here. However, this is still pretty good pizza. Been here twice, with the last one being a birthday offer for a free large pizza. All you have to do is sign up for their email subscription!   Anyway, the first time I was there, I ordered the pesto pizza with spinach and spicy chicken sausage and a NY style cheesecake. Pizza was cooked evenly, crust had a nice crispness to it, and it wasn't overly greased like you see with other pizza places. The spicy chicken sausage definitely had a nice kick to it! Cheesecake was pretty good too. Second time around, I had the regular pizza with sausage, peppers, and mushrooms. Again, this pizza was solid. Although you could tell it wasn't truly from New York, it's close enough that if I was in the mood for NY pizza, it would definitely do its job.  In most instances, I would give this place 4 stars, so why am I adding the 5th? They messed up my order and actually made the same pie twice. Instead of throwing it out, they actually gave it to me for free. SCORE! Free pizza that would probably last me 2 or 3 meals! Service was outstanding both times. Servers were very friendly, attentive, and outgoing. Ambience was very New York-ish too. Lots of pictures of NY on the walls with Frank Sinatra playing in the background.",

Lucky I made a reservation, others had to wait 20-30 minutes as there were private parties, families couples and groups of folks everywhere...and the place is pretty big. Plenty of staff to serve everyone and we were quickly seated. Ordered the house salad and a couple of personal sized pizzas. The salad arrived quickly and one small took care of two of us. There was one guy tossing the pizza dough and he was putting on quite a show, although not sure I would want the pizza where he ran the dough across his back, that shirt was a bit sweaty. But, he was talented  that is for sure. Pizza arrived and it was very good, New York style  thin crust. Cheese was fresh and excellent, good sauce, crust while the bottom was crisp and the edges done well, there was still a thin layer of soggy between the toppings and the bottom. Maybe that is just the way a brick oven cooks. Overall a superior product that will bring me back again.",

Any toppings you want, they got but I do suggest that you don't put too many on the pizza because it just ruins it. Plus the toppings get heavy and your pizza wouldn't support it. The other plus is their Ceaser Salad. Everything is good including the staff who is on point! Good job guys and keep up the good work.",

I was looking for some good pie as I am missing the east coast.  I found this place in a nice upscale outdoor shopping plaza.  I walked in and was seated pretty much right away.  I ordered a soda and the large pie, (I had a feeling I would eat well in the hotel later, I was right).  I got pepperoni and mushroom.  The pizza came out about 20 min later and it was fantastic, the crust was thin and properly blackened from the brick oven, the sauce was proportioned well with crushed tomato and the mozzarella was applied in slices which was a nice touch.  I ate half and took the other half to go.  It was just as delicious later.  When I went in I did not know that this was a chain and was a pizza company started in NYC but has grown across the country.  I cannot wait to get home and try out the Tampa location!",

When my pizza finally arrived, well after the rest of my party was finished eating, I asked for a to go box as our lunch hour is over. The waiter apologized and told me he was having it compt, I was appreciative of the gesture. Then my bill arrived and the only item compt was the pizza and I was charged separately for my tea and side salad. Now I did eat the salad and drink the tea but to be charged $7.08 for a side lunch salad and iced tea is ridiculous considering the lunch special for the pizza, side salad and drink for my companions was only $9.00. What a joke and I definitely will consider twice before eating at Gimaldi's Pizzeria again!",

And the seasonal cheesecakes are great. Assuming that were are ordering less than 1 pizza for every other person, then I usually have room for the cheesecake and never regret it. If you do overdo it at dinner... just do some jumping jacks and pack it down!  The staff is friendly and I've only ever had 1 issue with anyone here.

UNBELIEVABLE. So so frustrated and angry she says she will credit my acct which I will follow up with and make sure it gets done but so angry and not sure if I will be going back.

    "text": "I am a fan!  My dearest and I went last night - he is borderline diabetic so doesn't eat pizza very often.  But, he had a need for za so we went to Grimaldi's.  We had been there once before many year ago with a larger party but this was just the two of us.  Red and white checkered tablecloths - I looked around for LADY or a TRAMP but none in sight.  We got there early and were lucky to score a high top table as the place was filled otherwise.  Our waitress was so good.  Personable, knowledgeable about the menu and much more importantly, friendly.    I ordered the house pinot  for $4.00.  WOW.  Generous pour and a really nice pinot.  OK so my dearest went with a Miller Lite.............  There are three basic choices for the pizza.   Regular, tomato based sauce (sure it was San Marzano's), white sauce and pesto.  We opted for the regular with meatball, onion, mushroom and green pepper on half for you know who!  Not me!  The atmosphere is fun - lively, kids doing their thing, and a great patio!  We waited awhile for our pizza but it was fun just date talking and people watching.   Several of the people around us ordered one of their salads.  They looked wonderful and the small one easily feeds 3 if not 4.    When our pizza came it was delicioso!  I am such a fan.  They only serve beer and wine but what's not to like with an excellent pino grig at $4 and Miller Lite ( oh yes they did have many other more palatable options).    I am looking forward to going back!  Highly recommended!",

I love their menu, simple and to the point...salads, pizzas and calzones.  We started off with a small caesar salad, which could feed 3-4 people.  It was tangy and fresh tasting, with crunchy croutons.  We couldn't stop eating it.  But, then our pizza arrived...a large with ricotta, fresh sliced tomatoes and half meatball...mouth-watering!  I've never been a big fan of overly sauced pizza, and this always has just the right amount on it.  The crust is the perfect vehicle for their fresh ingredients.  My husband finished off his slices, and I took home half of mine (to be enjoyed later).  The staff was very nice, but the food was \"MWAAAH\"!!  We can't wait to come back.",

Pizzas remain incredibly yummy, service is fast and kind, and it's an excellent choice when you have kids.  The dough they give younglings to play with keeps them occupied and is a winner of an idea.  We had one boo-boo where the server mixed up my little girl's order.  The manager immediately came out, apologized, and said it was on them.  An occasional error happens and I told him that was nice to offer, but not necessary.    TIP: We ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake to share for dessert-- makes you want to say Hallelujah after each bite.    The bill came and both my daughter's meal and the dessert were credited back.  I made it up on the tip side, but it was a forthright gesture that the place wants to nail the dining experience every time.  NICE!",

Our local friends wanted to take us to Grimaldi's instead, their favorite pizzeria about 20 minutes away. Being the Yelpcurious sort, I was game to try this much hyped place. The downside to a place that has been hyped is that one's expectations are higher.   We ordered:  * Mediterranean Salad - Tasted fresh and good, but the dressing wasn't very balanced. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=ARQro-dR-8Hd90yb1yUyAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/93FN...</a> * Pizza half plain cheese, half with basil and tomatoes <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=SbHD7fVvL32LgaUIpCBq9Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/93FN...</a> * Pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and basil <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=wl7YMUaOquTxdYgR4SG6Hg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/93FN...</a> * Louis Martini Cabernet - for our friend * Red Sangria - for our friend  Positives:  + I'm all about the thin crust. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=qf12YBWeKcLe2leFp09fPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/93FN...</a> + The sauce has a nice kick to it. + The fresh mozzarella tasted good. In fact, everything was very fresh. + They give kids pizza dough to play with while waiting for the food - fun! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=9ZRm5qrrVJIQDnohj1llDA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/93FN...</a>  Negatives:  - There was a 45 minute wait - the price of popularity. - The service had chain feel to it that didn't rub me the right way. \"I'm (server's name), and I'm going to take care of you.\" It was friendly enough, but wasn't for me. - My friend's pizza didn't have enough basil, and she asked for more. Our server said she could bring more for $2. That was disappointing for a tiny dish of chopped basil, considering it was already a topping and our $75 bill.  Overall, I enjoyed the pizza and the kid-friendly atmosphere. It wasn't the best ever, but I'm a fan.",

(the manager or hostess checked twice learning over to see if I had sausage on mine, there was so little in there in comparison to my daughters.. ) Took me 20 minutes to catch the manager/hostess she happened to be near us diming the lights. we were unable to get out waitresses attention whatsoever. She did come by immediately after the did was delivered to check. She was cheerful and nice, just never came back again. when we finally got the manager I told her I never got one refill of iced tea. We asking ed for boxes  to go frustrated at that point. She did ask to remake.. I was done by then.. Let me pay my check and leave. An attempt is made to get me to order dessert.. No thank you..My food to go please. $50 later for two people, one ice tea, 2 pizzas and a salad that I never got packed... She gave me 2 $5 of coupons to return... Bahhaha.... Nope! Passed them to my nephew at the next table. I'll stick with Nick & Bens Pizza! Far better, great price and fantastic service. On the way out I looked at the manager and said., \"By the way.. I never got my salad packed as asked\" (Was taking it home to enjoy with Ranch, dressing which is not an option at Grimaldis) Her comment \"It's no biggie\" ?!?! Hmmm, probably not the best thing to reply to a frustrated customer. I really expected better, beautiful atmosphere and restaurant. Pizza oven... They could be the place to enjoy often if not for the service. Very disappointed.",

When it was our turn, they went to seat us outside, which they didn't ask if we wanted, sat us at a small table next to a construction barrier. We had to move the table slightly because it was too close to the other gentleman sitting behind us, which made the table super wobbly. The table cloth was extremely dirty and when I asked if we could get a different table he said he would have to put me back on the wait list. I told him the table was dirty, he proceeded to look at the table and wiped some crumbs off the table and said, \"yep, that is dirty\". The host just walked away and went back to his station, not really caring.   We just got up and left, that's just ridiculous. If you're going to sit people outside next to a dirty construction site, you may want to ask your customers if they are ok sitting there first.   I love Grimaldi's pizza, but I won't be going back to that location again.",

My family had a problem with the order. We only got the salads in and there were problems with two out of three of them. Only one of the two Caesars were supposed to have no croutons, both came out with none while the house was supposed to come with the olives on the side. This was after having an issue with seating. When that was brought up to the manager, the manager took no accountability and said it wasn't on the ticket. We did tell the server this and it wasn't so either it was read wrong or not put. The manager couldn't be bothered to make things right. A good manager says \"I'm sorry, what can I do to help\" after listening to the issue, this manager didn't. It pains me to give this place a one star review but I can't help it. They changed for the worst.",

WARNING: they do not have ranch, at all! I personally don't eat ranch in my pizza, but I know a lot of people that do. They also don't have wings.   Our favorite pizza is odd, but always great. We order red sauce, sausage, ricotta, and pesto drizzle, and they make it great. The pizza is a ha d tossed thin crust style pizza, the sauce has a great taste and they use quality ingredients. The portions are large, but the price is a little high compared to other pizza places.   The atmosphere is very comfy with dark lighting, a big bar, and the best part is you can watch them making your pizza. They toss the dough in the air, dress it up, and put it into a coal oven to cook.   Always a good bet for a date night, and since it's right next to the theatre, it's one stop shopping!",

My daughter had made reservations for the back room for a table and then she rechecked the afternoon of the event and when we got there they had put us out front with all the noise, said they had a party of 20 that called in and they put them in the back room. The funny thing was the group of 20 never showed up and that room was empty the whole time so they're not customer friendly. Money is their bottom line. And the pizza was just so-so and it's on the expensive side. Will never go back although after a disagreement with my daughter they gave us 20% off of the order but by then we had a sour taste in our mouth about the place",

One thing I will recommend is to check the bottom of your crust as sometimes the pizzas will get too charred if the person Manning the oven isn't doing their job properly. This happened to us on our visit last week. The bartender handled getting a new one made and the mgr approached us with an apology which was greatly appreciated. My husband was a little Bent because he expected a discount and or a free beer. We had already paid and while waiting hubby ordered another beer. Sadly the tip he left ended up paying for his beer because of his dissatisfaction. I want to apologize to the bartender because he was great!  This will not affect my opinion about the product and staff,  we will be back.  Lastly,  I need to know how to get back on that \"free\" b'day pizza list!  I looked forward to it every year and wish it would continue!!",

    "text": "Well if you are looking for a long review talking about everything else that does not matter read on.  I will only talk about the one thing that takes us to the places we love to eat.  That is the food.    I will reminisce a bit.  When I was a kid we lived away from everything.   The only pizza I had was pizza my mother made.  Most of it was by scratch too.  The only thing she purchased was the sauce and peperoni.  That was some of the best pizza too.  I did not have commercialized pizza until I was almost 12 years old.  Then there was only one pizza place that delivered there too.  Arizona seems to have had a bloom of pizza.  There are some very good pizza places here.  (I am covering all the bases too.  Because there are different types of pizza)   I am glad to say this place is one of my favourite places to eat pizza.  We have come here a few times and it has been solid.  We stopped by here after watching a Wind River at the Harkins.  Good movie BTW.  This time we got a salad which was great.  The pizza was half peperoni and sausage.  The other half was cheese.  The pizza was super good.  Not much more is needed to say about it.  I am sure if I did some research this place probably has roots in New York or some where in that area of the USA.    People give this place a try.  I am sure you will like it.  Just remember there are different styles of pizza for the different types of people.  This place is a oven style with a thin crust.  It will be different than a Chicago deep dish.  Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.",

I tried this place because I saw a lot of people waiting to be seated so I put two and two together and figured this would be worth a look. Okay so the pizza is pretty awesome but the real MVP is the calzone. It is served with a tangy marinara sauce. They are not stingy with the cheese. The pizza is full of flavor and by far my favorite from any other pizzeria. The cons are the wait don't show up hungry because you will be quite hangry. The pizza crust can sometimes scratch the roof of your mouth; beware and eat slowly. Oh one more thing if you sign up with them online you get a free pizza on your birthday. Love this place!",

When we were finished the bartender took my card to process the payment; now I don't know what happened with the computer on Grimaldi's end but the comment the bartender says next was not necessary. He assumed I was trying to cheat them and that I had no money on my card as he says, 'I know what's going on here' and looks at me.   I was so shocked I looked back at him in disbelief as he asks me if he can run my card again. I say yes; still in shock, angry, and frustrated at this point, and again the card didn't work and the computer began to freeze all together.   The bartender then leaves with my card and doesn't tell me what's going on and proceeds to get another employee over to assist. They take a picture of my card for record and the other employee noticed the computer was frozen and they finally got it to work.   All in all everything from the ending was unprofessional and could've been handled so much better and differently. Not only was I embarrassed by the bartender but also treated so poorly by the staff. No apology was given. I won't be back!",

I think it is awesome as so many restaurants simply give you a free dessert and neither one of us are really big dessert eater's. So we started off with their seasonal Strawberry Salad and it was scrumptious. The small size was the perfect size for the two of us to share and the ratio of ingredients was spot on. For our pizza we ordered our traditional White pizza and added Roma tomatoes, sweet red peppers, and ricotta cheese. This combination is phenomenal, especially when sprinkled with balsamic vinegar on top. Service was top-notch (as always) and the food was outstanding again!",

This took place at 930 on a Tuesday. To top it off the prices are ridiculously high. The pizza, in my opinion, very low quality and unaesthetic. Little Caesar's is honestly better. I cant tell you how disappointed I was when they delivered the pizza. I realized I could have bought pizza at the movies for half the price and they have ranch too. The marinara is too sweet. It was just a terrible experience altogether. I've attached a picture of the pizza. Honestly, anything is better. Save your money!!",

The pizza is definitely just for two people it's about six slices medium slices not to small just perfect. Our salad arrived right away and our pizza right after that. Service was fast.

I would've added a bit more dressing and preferred buttered seasoned croutons instead the toasted bread cubes, but it was good. My friends pizza came out a good four minutes before my pizza arrived, even though we ordered at the same time and my pizza had less toppings. The pizzas were good, fresh ingredients. They only offer thin crust, which I prefer, but not for everyone. I liked the very fresh whole milk mozzarella, it melts so much better and adds that string cheesy pull. The personal size pizza that we ordered was more than enough for two to share. It's a cool place to hang out and good for a date night",

We arrived and were given the option of waiting thirty (30) minutes or sitting outside. Opting for the outdoor seating, and given the heat, we expected a waiter that would at least make sure we had something to drink.  The service started out normal with drinks coming out fairly quickly; however, that was the end of the pleasantries. Again, with the heat, our drinks went rather quickly. Our empty glasses sat for roughly 10 minutes before our waiter (Vanessa) came back to refill them. Seated outside, we had no clue where our waiter was most of the time because we only saw her three times: 1) when she took our order, 2) when she refilled our drinks (for the first and only time), and 3) when she brought us the check. To make matters worse, the waiter helping the people across from us was doing an excellent job (i.e., refilling drinks, conversing, and checking on the quality of the food). It was like night and day between the waiters.   Overall, our waiter was either ready to clock out or just didn't care about us. Again, the food is good, but the service can be ridiculously bad. It was not a nice way to spend a Father's Day.",

We were given gift cards thirteen months ago. Four times, including this afternoon, we tried to make reservations but were told that they were booked for the entire day. Finally I asked if I could cash in the gift cards because using them has proved impossible. The hostess was able to find us a table when I requested a refund.  After we were seated, we looked around at the dining room. There were at least six empty tables. Six! We arrived at 1:30. Our pizza wasn't served until 2:10. During those 40 minutes, two of those six tables were seated. Why claim to be booked out and have tables sit empty for 40 minutes?  The pizza and calzone were mediocre at best. The crust was chewy and flat. There is a lack of salt and pepper, it seems. The salad had only four ingredients so I paid the extra 5 dollars to put chicken in it.  The service was average. I do not see us going back.",

When I went here with my family this weekend, the restaurant estimated an hour wait, so we stood outside by the fireplaces. Grimaldi's even offered to text us when our table was ready, so we were free to stroll around outside without fear of losing our table.  Love the pizza! So delicious. Great cheese and sauce. Even though I'm not usually a huge fan of thin crust, this pizza makes up for it in great taste. You pay for each topping, so we've always stuck to about one or two toppings. One large pizza feeds two people (with maybe one or two pieces to take home as leftovers). Just tried the pepperoni topping for the first time, loved it! They are little bite-sized, thicker slices than your normal pepperoni. I usually get sliced roma tomatoes and sausage..yum!  Also love the experience of just being here. While you wait for your pizza you can sit and watch the chefs twirl the pizza dough. Charming decor of wine bottle light fixtures and checkered table clothes.  I've always had friendly servers the 4 or 5 times I've been here. Also I would recommend everyone to sign up for their email newsletters! You get a free large pizza on your birthday! SO worth it!",

    "text": "Coming out of a later movie in Glendale the other night, we decided to look for a place to eat nearby.  Whipped out the smartphone, set the setting to YELP, and the tractor beam locked onto Grimaldi's nearby.  Off we went at warp speed.  At the time of arrival, which was later dinnertime, there was no wait.  We got a table and had to hop up on the chairs to sit there.  Looking around, I enjoyed the whimsy of the decor, with what appeared as wine bottles with their bottoms cut off as hanging lights, different NYC Subway signs, some b&w classic NYC scenes, and the cooks nearby, twirling the pizza dough.  The menu is clearly focused on the pies, with basically just a few appetizers and salads for other items.  We ordered a Caesar salad to start.  The plate and salad were nice and chilled, with the dressing having a slight lemon taste; it was light, not a hearty Caesar dressing, but enjoyable.  The presentation of the pizza is as they should be: a stand to give it the respect it deserves, and served on a platter with a serving utensil (unlike many places that just expect you to use your own fork or knife--barbarians!)  Ours was a large, thin crust cheese pizza with fresh tomatoes and kalamata olives.  The tomatoes were perfectly cut and distributed--it looked like a pepperoni pizza.  The olives stood out, very nice flavor with a salty kick--these were the good ones and not overcooked!  Although I did order a pie with sauce, I didn't really notice it...maybe they didn't use much.  I hope to return and try that again.  Though there was plenty to fill us up and take a few pieces home, we decided to save room for dessert and ordered the tiramisu, which is always interesting to see how each place interprets it.  We found they don't make their own (though they do make their own cheesecakes), but it was excellent: very moist and flavorful.  Our service was great: the waitress came over several times to see how we were doing and someone else came by towards the end to see if we had a good experience.  Of course, it also wasn't the rush hour, so that helped.  I hope to make it back to this or another of their locations, as it has great thin crust pizza WITHOUT a huge wait.  Beam me back, Scotty!",

This place has some of the BEST customer service I have ever experienced and the pizza tickles the taste buds in the most delectable of ways. If you are looking for a great pizza and a home town feel, look no further. The GM Mike was very warm and inviting. If you're looking for a great bartender make sure to see Lindsay and for a vivacious rad server, ask for Tommy. Some of the best staff in town.",

The manager fixed it by giving us a free large pie on our next visit. Sign everyone up for the birthday club. A free birthday pizza every year. Parking is tight around here because of the Harkins across the street.  When our kids were little the wait staff would give them a pizza pan with some dough on it to play with while we waited for the pie.  As for the pizza, we love it. Thin crust and folds perfectly for one handed eating. The salads are top notch.  This place has a nice NY feel and was a real welcome addition to the west side. Worth every cent!",

    "text": "delicious pizza but inconsistent.  We frequent Grimaldi's often for eat in and carry out. Our favorite toppings are fresh garlic, ricotta, pepperoni, and Italian sausage. Most times everything is great. This last time there was an overload of sauce and a lack of cheese. Imagine just entire pieces striped an inch thick, the whole length with only sauce. The cheese adds the correct element of saltiness even it is not stretchy. When there's not enough (and an overload of sauce), the whole pizza is disappointing. Maybe they had a new chef because even the ricotta was just dumped on in huge chunks.  The server: She was pleasant but infrequently seen despite only having three tables.  The hostess: Was completely missing. We waited several minutes for someone to even say hi. The bar tender (why was he wearing purple?) sat us. Strange.  Hopefully this was just an off night for Grimaldi's because I'd hate if the service and pizza was going downhill. It's our favorite in Arizona!",

We sat down and ordered 15 minutes later, got our salads then waited an hour before we noticed our food was not at the table yet. After addressing it with the manager she said it would be ANOTHER 40 minutes and was not apologetic and had informed us that our server should have told us it was 1.5 wait for our pizza.  This place is seriously unorganized and is in desperate need of a staff revamp. We couldn't wait because we had an event so all 9 of us had to leave. They still charged us for our alcohol. This is the worst dining experience I have ever encountered and will never be eating at this location EVER AGAIN.

So I found out when we got there about 25 people were going to show up, I let the waitress know who in turn told her \"manager\", she came to me and told me she couldn't accommodate more people because they were just too packed. This stressed me out because I planed the event so I just told people that we should leave and go to Buca Di Bepo where they are ok with a big party. When more of my guests arrived, another manager named Mike came and saw my friends sharing a chair took the initiative to get us another table which made me feel a lot better. We had a really good time and the food was so good! My suggestion is if you're going to have a big party, don't come here because it's way too small of a place and Park West has the worse parking lot. This place is better for a smaller party. Oh and when I made the reservation they said I had to have a $200 minimum and could only have the table for 2 hours, that really didn't make much sense to me. Anyway, I wouldn't come back as often, the women manager put a bad taste in my mouth, you would think that my guests money is just as any other person waiting for a table",
