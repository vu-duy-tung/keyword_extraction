A lot of seasoning can tramendously affect the taste. I was a little bit frightened as to see what it is like and tasted. The chef's did not disappoint. I liked it (I got rice noodles). The rice noodles to be honest was a bittle bland, but I got a side of teriyaki sauce and it made the rice noodles more tasty.  The service was decent. The waitress was a little slow but in the end acconplished what we requested.  The atmosphere was clean and welcoming...a little bit dark for lunch time.",

I filled up my bowl only to hear one of the cooks at the end complaining about how much he makes and what is and is not going to do for his money. That being said I made sure he saw me put some money in is tip jar out of fear for my food.  When I got my food it was like only half of the topping came back, I was left wondering if I got the wrong bowl, but sure enough it was mine.   Not sure if I will go back anytime soon.",

Service was exactly what I needed to be, not too much not too little.  It's all changed.  In attempt to confuse and infuriate you there are now  multiple bowl sizes that connects to a rule about not having food at your tray where they try to nickel and dime you. don't worry, you won't forget as there are tons of signs pointing this out about how we will charge you if you even slightly askew from their plan. Gone are the days of just getting a bowl and using engineering skills to build a leaning Tower of food.  As well, they have implemented new, at the table digital check out system. These are great, but because the staff already doesn't have much to do in a self-service restaurant, you've never seen people dig for tips harder in your life. It's actually pretty unfortunate... being friendly is good, continuously interrupting our dinner and attempting to be helpful because you have nothing to do is not.  Sorry, you guys were doing it well for so long but apparently it couldn't last.",

Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.  Pros: - Friendly and helpful hostess - A variety of proteins to choose from  Cons: - My noodles were overcooked and mushy :-( - The sauce was SPICY, it was not marked as spicy. I thought the whole concept of being able to customize your meal is to add spice if you want it. - It took a long time for them to cook it - $12 lunch; noodle bowl and drink. The portion size was mediocre for the price.  Since the cons outweigh the pros, I would not recommend.",

Easily to best Mongolian grill-type restaurant that I've been to - deserving of 5-stars in the Mongolian category. It's quite a drive for me to the nearest Genghis Grill, but worth it. I dine here several time a year and like to bring out of town visitors.  I love their fresh meats - not frozen slices that you need to smash down in your bowl, like virtually every MG restaurant. Has the largest selection of meats, veggies and sauces that I've seen. They now offer three bowl sizes, instead of just one.   On the negative side, they used to have 12 \"recipe\" cards that assisted new visitors on building their bowls, but they've replaced those with newer recipes that aren't nearly as appealing. They've also implemented - inexplicably - a policy of charging a person an additional $4 for going backward through the food line (i.e., to add a item you overlooked, or more of a favorite item). They also could improve on labeling all food items.",

    "text": "This location was better a year ago before they turned it around to make it like all the other ones. I remember back in the day, Happy Hour was all weekend and all well drinks were $2!!  They didn't have all the perks, like the appetizers or \"large\" bowl option, or even the little ordering cards.  I keep going back though, and the food is still tasting good, so I am acclimating. I really like the build-it-yourself philosophy.  Perhaps I am a control freak, but I like to decide how much spice and sauce and broccoli goes into my bowl. I like a lot of broccoli, moderate amount of sauce, and a little spice.  My husband goes the complete opposite route with no broccoli, tons of sauce, and too much spice. It just would not be a complete experience at Genghis Grill if it does not include him pondering that maybe his bowl is too spicy.  Getting back to those appetizers, I suggest skipping them. If you shove down all the contents of your bowl as you  go through the line, a regular bowl is enough food.  We got the edamame last time because it was included in a coupon, and it was mediocre. We also got the ice cream since it was also included in the coupon, and it was also mediocre.  Envision two very small scoops of vanilla ice cream in a small dish, lightly drizzled with chocolate sauce.  That is the sundae. No whip cream, no sprinkles and no cherry on top.   The servers are always friendly and the people watching is usually acceptably entertaining.  Sign up for their mailing list because you get good coupons (although then you wind up with boring edamame and cherry-less sundaes....). Kids eat free on Tuesdays!",

    "text": "Being a lifelong YC's patron, my interest was piqued when I saw there was another Mongolian bbq restaurant in Tempe.  To short-cut to the differences between the two, Genghis Grill:  -Has smaller bowls, so smaller portions as a result -Has more selection, with more expensive types of meat and veggies such as bay scallops, calamari, and snow peas -Is about $10 for a single bowl -Has thicker, sweeter tasting sauces that have to be mixed in after the food is cooked (Otherwise they burn due to the sugar content).  With YC's, the sauces can be directly ladled onto your bowl and are cooked with the meat and vegetables. -Offers alcoholic beverages, and has a cheap happy hour (Which I have yet to try) -Does not have any free range soup or soft serve with your meal.  Drinks are provided by your server, rather than a free range soda fountain. -Servers bring your bowl to your table, rather than waiting at the counter -Does not offer you any waxed paper to push your meat/vegetables into the bowl so you can maximize on bowl space  Since the price is the same no matter what you get, I loaded up on seafood, getting a mix of marinated fish, shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  I got some veggies, 2 spoons of spice mixture, and a mix of szechuan, Khanzu, and ginger-citrus sauce.  While the combination tasted good itself, the thinner cuts of seafood ended up being done faster than the larger cuts.  As a result, the scallops and calamari tasted tough and overcooked while the shrimp was cooked just right.    Service was friendly and attentive.  While I do like the bigger selection of items to choose from, I like the thinner, less sugary sauces at YC's and the bigger bowls.  It's a tough call, but I would say, if you want more seafood and higher quality meat in general, go with Genghis, but the better deal will be at YC's.",

Genghis grill is fantastic! You can't really complain about the food, because you literally build your own stir-fry. The selection in the little buffet thingy is great!   The only complaint is that their drinks are too expensive. We arrived during happy hour & I ordered the $4 Bloody Mary that was on special, & it was disappointingly small.

My problem being VEGAN is that the meat station is at the beginning of the line.  This wouldn't be a problem if PEOPLE DIDN'T USE THE VEGETABLE TONGS TO SQUISH DOWN THEIR RAW MEAT into the tiny bowls provided.  I asked the line staff how they prevent cross contamination to which she replied \"I dont understand what that means.\"  Ok, fair enough, she isnt educated.  So I asked for a separate clean tong to use, even though I know that \"meat juices\" are already mixed in with the veggies.  She said they only have one for each container, and no extra clean ones.  At this point I was just too grossed out to eat.  My husband, being a carnivore didnt mind, but has been in the bathroom \"declaring war on Mongolia\" all evening, so I guess my theory could have been correct.   We brought all this up to our waitress, as I would have like to have had dinner there, and she says its the corporate office's decision to have it that way, and had been asked this same question several times before. She mentioned that Muslims should absolutely NOT eat there, as there was NO way of knowing for sure if the food was cross contaminated with pork, and that the sign asking about \"allergies, and special dietary requests\" was a joke.  Until they switch up the order of the stations, Veggies Beware!",

Best thing I like is the selection, and it's fresh meat not the frozen shaved stuff.  Along with the meats, they have scallops and shrimp, and that ain't too shabby in my opinion.  Then there's a huge collection of veggies , spices, and sauces.  You can play around with the sauces and create some very delicious combinations.  I love the texture of their noodles, chewy but firm.    Atmosphere is pretty nice and the crowd that comes there is pretty chill too.  I love their happy hour, can't beat one dollar well drinks.  I also like the fact that they are open till 10 or 11 on most nights, perfect place to eat after catching a flick at the theater nearby.  They're bit more pricey than other bbq's but I think it's well worth the extra few bucks.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of grillin' Mongolian style.  I love Asian food in general, so this is right up my alley.  (I must be out of the loop and super-uncool because I have absolutely no idea what this YC is that you speak of...)  I feel this place has taken a lot of mistakes of other Mongolian grills and learned from them  Here's the lowdown on the pros and cons...  Pros: **A wide selection of everything!  Meats offer the traditional steak, chicken, pork, but also options such as shrimp, crab (albeit imitation), scallops, and tofu.  Veggies have pepper and onion combos, mandarin oranges, celery, raw egg, and a few other options that I haven't seen at other establishments.  The starches are more than white rice here - they offer brown rice and udon noodles too.  **Seasonings and sauces.  They have a bunch of seasonings to put on your meat before you pile on the veggies.  I think this is a good idea.  I have no idea if my shrimp was more or less tasty because I did it, but it made me feel better having another option to make it my own.  Their sauces are all sugar based and they add them at the end (which is a plus) so they don't burn.  The how-to list of concoctions is handy, but I like to be brave and go it alone.  It's definitely a trial and error process.  **Price.  I think $8 is reasonable for a large bowl of Mongolian grill.  Granted, there are some tips and tricks to getting the most out of your dollar (pile high and push it down my friends) and some strategery to the order of which you load on your veggies.  **Happy hour.  I can't remember what all of their drink specials are, but I know there are $2 wells and they make 'em strong. Nuff said.  Cons: **The all-you-can-eat propaganda.  As a person who never makes the most of a buffet, all-you-can-eat is not really for me.  I think how it works here is that you can go back and do a second+ bowl and move up to the $12 bracket.  I like a lot of veggies and I had a hard time getting all I wanted in the bowl (yes, even with all of the tips and tricks), but I would have willingly paid the $12 to get two bowls at the get go to make one bad mamma jamma of a stir-fry.  Maybe next time I'll see if I can finagle...  **Assembly line set-up.  You can only serve from one side of the item line and let me say, it can be a little daunting.  For a first timer taking their time and getting it all worked out, you start to feel the pressure as the line builds behind you.  It's not a process in which I like to be rushed.  It's not a big deal and people can go around or whatnot, but it's not very conducive to serving a lot of people at once.  I'll definitely be back to have another go at it.  Skip YC's and go straight to Genghis Grill, or so I've been told...",

The food was great and my favorite part was that the area where you get your food had fresh meat, most Mongolian places I have been to usually have frozen stuff, I forget exactly but am sure they had like 15 or so different meats to choose from. I've had Mongolian BBQ all over Cali and this is the only place I will go to now due to how fresh their meat was. We were in and out fairly quick, which was great since we were rushing to catch our movie. We will definitely be back with our kids and family!",

My experience eating here was probably a lot like Shawn Johnson's experience at the games -- not quite the showing I expected, but GG still managed to eek out a medal or two.  My favorite Mongolian places include soup and salad bars in addition to the ingredients to be grilled; Genghis Grill does not. I missed being able to snack on a salad while waiting on my first bowl.   The ingredients were all fine; most seemed fresh, but I had to avoid a couple of the less popular offereings (for the life of me, I don't understand why bok choy hasn't captured the hearts of the American public). The sauces were generally tasty...think Trader Joe's bottled dressings and you'll get the idea.   The highlight of the night was when I realized the shredded cheese that given to me by request came free and clear. Of course, this made me wish I would have asked for sour cream, too.   You won't see a picture of my experience at the Genghis Grill on a Wheaties box any time soon, but the meal was pleasant enough for a solid three stars.",

But this place is the best I've found so far.  basically you pick the ingredients from a buffet style set up, and then they cook it on a huge open range.  Lots of meats, veggies, and spices, and a decent selection for the vegan/vegitarian crowd.  its a little pricy, about 9 bucks for a single bowl and 15 for unlimited trips, but compared to the rest of the mongolian rip offs around town this is the bee's knees.  And for the people concerned about cross contamination, its all cooked after you make your selection so raw meat touching the veggies doesnt really hurt anything.",

Since I was going to be in Tempe, I figured WHY NOT?!  Genghis Grill is  not my thing.   We got seated and handed a small metal bowl, I was confused.  At the other mongolian places I have been, you start out with a big bowl not this dinky bowl.  So, I say \"whatever, fatty\" in my head and head over to the start line to get this meal going.  What do I see?  Nothing but the sickest thing I have seen in a long time.  A BIG-ASS BOWL of BLOODY MEAT, just sitting there in a bowl of blood.  I've never wanted to be a vegetarian so badly in my life.  I suppose I was used to YC's where the meat is frozen and shaved.   I don't like actually seeing the blood of a meat product, it really grosses me out.    Anyhow, the bowl didn't fit nearly as much food as other places, I guess it's good I didn't over -stuff myself but the price was higher and that whole  meat product area was really bad.  Oh and the scallops, I think they were scallops?  Anyhow it was like a bowl of white fluff (you know marshmallow fluff? in a far?) No real shape to them.    So this whole \"fresh\" meat, chicken area is one of the grossest things I have seen in a long time.   I must say that after it was all cooked and brought to the table it was more than enough food and it tasted okay, not what I was expecting.",

Maybe it's the hunter in me, or just the boundless enthusiasm I attach with the ability of choice combine with meat.  The concept is simple for your typical mongolian grill.  This place has a great location in Tempe Marketplace and it's quick if you want to catch a movie next door.  This is pretty much a staple whenever I visit the Phoenix area.  If you've never done mongolian grill before, don't fear -- the food is completely sanitary, preserved under the right conditions, and constantly replenished.  And vegetarians, delight in that you can have a healthy meal sans meat, despite the salivating carnivores around every turn.  You can go for a single bowl, or upgrade to unlimited for just a few bucks more.  The sauces range from mild to insanely spicy, so there's really something for everyone.  I can't wait to go back!",

We went most recently because I had a birthday coupon from them for a free bowl, but I've been there several times before and each time this place has been consistently tasty. I like building my own meal from their provided options, and somehow I always manage to make mine pretty darn good. I do think it is a little expensive, but then again you can go ahead and pile up the meat and veggies in your bowl if you want to get the most food for your money.   The only downside is that the place is pretty crowded (tables and benches are placed close together) and often pretty loud. They haven't been as busy the past few times I've been there, but I think that's because it's summer and the ASU kids have cleared out.  This is our usual stop when we are at the Tempe Marketplace.

As I walked in, I looked at the bowls and chuckled. \"There's no way that's gonna fill me up\" I thought. Boy was I surprised.   So the general idea here is you get a bowl, walk down the line and throw in all the ingredients you want. From beef to chicken to a few fishes and the other white meat, there's no way they won't have what you want. Add some veggies at the next station then down to the sauce station. Here is where the fun is as you try and mix and match sauces to make something that tastes good. Next stop is the cook who asks what you want your concoction mixed with (rice, fried rice, udon noodles, a couple others I can't remember.) Five minutes later your eating what hopefully tastes good and the size is not disappointing.  I will forever be a fan of this joint as it gives me the ability to choose what I want in my food down to the detail.  The staff isn't as attentive when it's busy meaning empty drinks for a bit, but they are friendly and helpful when they are around.",

Then load as much as I can in the tiny bowl. The people who toss your food to cook are rude,half fell off,who cares I'm just paying $11 for a tiny bowl. Then you just have to figure out what to do next. Do I wait?? Guess not. Go sit they will bring to you. Ok my food was great but I selected it so that was expected. Some things I didn't have in my selection were in my food??. Fiery hot peppers..no thanks. I'm probably not coming back. I'll stick with. YC's get more food for less and they guide you with manners.",

Pretty much set up as a chipotle style Mongolian grill. You fill your bowls, don't let that small bowl fool you, you can pack as much as you want into it and when it is cooked, it's served in a bigger bowl.   You pick out your proteins, veggies, and sauces all buffet style. They even have spoons on the line  to try the many different sauces they provide.   Basically if you love a good noodle bowl that's freshly made, this place is where you need to be.   There is also a full bar to enjoy if necessary. It's also located in a beautiful location, surrounded with tons of places! When I go back, I will be here!!",

The managers Robby and Trevor were so helpful and provided excellent customer service. I have been to restaurants where the managers sat in the back and didn't help the servers. This was definitely not the case with these two! They jumped right in there and helped. I was also impressed with Jacob. He was working at the grill taking trays. He was very kind to all of the guests and also provided excellent customer service. I have been a server before so I tend to notice restaurants that go above and beyond! Keep up the good work Genghis Grill! I will be back!",

With the regular bowl coming in at $13, and without the ability to pile on your own starch (a la YC's), the value just isn't there. The premade sauces are thick and sugary, and not very tasty.   I am also continually frustrated by the presence of a waitstaff... while they do a fine job, it's just not necessary when you have to get up to make your own bowl anyway.   Fine in a pinch, but overpriced. Head to YC's where you can get soup and wontons included.",

The flaming arrow was also an interesting and good choice as well. The staff was great. Its right next to the movie theater and shopping so location is great too.",

Anyway, today there was a special for $6.99 bowls so my friends and I went. There's a variety of ingredients like bacon, sausage, pepperoni, chicken, beef, scallops, calamari, white fish, etc. Then there's the veggies and then the sauces.  The portions are definitely smaller than YC's. I still managed to get a pretty good amount of food into my bowl. At YC's, you have a bigger bowl and it's easier to smash everything into it. Here... not so much. But I found a way around it. Build a wall with broccoli and essentially make your bowl twice as big. It's a work of art and architecture in the end.  Sauces and flavors are good. Variety. Nice place to hang out with friends. :) Just make it work your buck. Pack it in!",

She has been one of the best waitresses we have had at any restaurant we have been to in a while!

    "text": "On 12/17/2014, i visited genghis grill for the 1st time. I dined at the Tempe Marketplace location with friends and family.   Upon entering the 'food line' to determine my bowl size and select my food ingredients, i immediately noticed the vast amount of food and debris on the floor in front of the food selection area, which was certainly not a positive impression of my 1st visit. During the length of our entire dining experience, that floor area was never cleaned up.   When selecting my bowl size an employee assisted but constantly inspected the bowls for cleanliness prior to distributing them to the customers and 'discarded' about 25% of the bowls on the 'clean' shelf. This made me uncomfortable because if the employee could not trust that the items would be clean, how could I?  Reaching the food selections located in the rear of the display cases was actually impossible to do so while maintaining proper hygiene. Because of their location in relation to the plastic sneeze shield, most customers including myself had to actually duck under the shield and reach our entire upper bodies under the shield to reach the food items in the rear of the display cases. This made the food selection process very difficult because the height clearance did not allow for much room to reach the food items in the rear of the display case  Many of the food items were in very low supply and we had to ask the employee to refill many of them, such as the spices, vegetables and sauces. I asked myself, 'Why aren't these items more constantly monitored by the employees to maintain proper food levels?'  my food was cooked and actually delivered with some burnt remains from what appeared to be an unclean grill surface or burnt remnants of another source.  I relay this information to you because i feel this location needs immediate attention and for the staff to be properly trained or retrained.  I am very disappointed by my 1st visit to any genghis grill.",

Then, you give it to the grill person and sit down.  As others have said, you don't wait at the grill - your server will bring you the food after you sit down (unlike the ubiquitous YC grill).  I would say the quality is better than YC.  Probably because the food is fresh rather than frozen.  Variety is also superior to YC - you have the usual fish ad pork, but you can also add various steak options, scallops, fish, and squid!  Awesome.  Lots of veggie options, and you can add egg(s).  The sauces are thick and flavorful.  It's also nice that you can pick from rice in addition to noodles.  My main complaint?  The portions are way small.  You can order all-you-can eat, but it's an extra $4 (maybe even $5? I don't recall exactly)...  I'm sure this is a cost-saving tactic, but jeez, stingy.",

This place is located within the Tempe Marketplace Mall, so you won't actually see it from the road.  When entering, we were immediately greeted by the hostess.  She asked how many were in our party, and I told her two.  We were seated at a table, and asked if we had been here before.  Daniel had, but I had not.  I am familiar with this sort of dining, but had not been to this particular chain or location to experience what the place was about.  Basically, the jist of the joint is that you prepare your own meal.  There is a buffet style setup with lots of raw ingredients.  Meat, steak, pork, chicken, etc.  There's also loads of veggies and spices to choose from, to make your meal complete.  Take as much (or as little) as you like.  What I really liked was that they had reciepe ideas on the wall.  this made it easier for someone like me who couldn't think of anything in particular that I felt like making at the moment.  After you assemble your dish, you give it to the guys at the grill.  In turn, they give you a number, and put it on your table.  When your food is done being cooked, they walk it out to your table.  I liked that! No waiting by the grill, especially with it being so hot here.  I don't remember what Daniel had, but I had a beef and veggie dish that I made myself.  Tasty!    I would gladly return to this location again, and enjoy thier dining.",

I probably try a new sauce everytime, and have never been disappointed! I also appreciate that they have marinara sauce and spiral noodles for my friends who are weary of asian food.  They also have AMAZING DRINK SPECIALS :) I had a two dollar mimosa this afternoon.  $1 Sake $2- Wells, Mimosas, Bud Light Drafts & Sweet tea Vodkas $3- Domestic Beers & Skyy Vodka $4- Bloody Marys, Import Beers $5- Sake Bombs and Jager Bombs..

    "text": "As far as this type of restaurant goes I vastly prefer Genghis to YCs. There are a lot of reasons why I prefer this place. One of which is that their meat looks much better then what YCs puts out. Also because it's not frozen there isn't a ton of suspended water content which means that when you get your food back it tastes better and the sauce isn't overly watery. Not to mention there is no freezer burn!  The veggies here almost always look more fresh then what I've come across at YCs. I love my onions and here they are crisp and freshly cut.  The portion sizes are a bit smaller, there is no denying that. But as far as flavor goes this place takes the cake from YCs.",

I tend to overload on veggies and find myself making a mess & then I feel bad, like I'm the jerk the workers have to clean up after lol. I never get the same thing every time..its like an adventure! Haha. The Khanzu (I think that's what its called) sauce is the best sauce I've tried so far. I liked that you get so many choices for your starch, some are more interesting than others (spiral pasta? tortillas?).. I'll just take the brown rice please! And pass the Sriracha!   I love this place so much I ate there twice last week...or maybe its because I live like 2 minutes away & my roommate had never been. Either or, still a great place, highly recommended!!",

When I got in line, I had no idea how they were going to charge me, by weight? certain ingredients? by gender? I didn't know. No one had explained it to me.  I found out later that you pay one flat price. I made it through the process fine, got my food and enjoyed it immensely, until I noticed that they did not put in one of my ingredients! They took out the pineapple from my bowl of ingredients that I handed them. Why?! What do they have against pineapples?  The waiter was very friendly, until he learned that I had a high value coupon. Then he practically ignored me the rest of the time.  That was fine, because I didn't really see the point of waiters at this restaurant anyway since they don't really need to take your order. Overall, the food was great, you get a lot for the price. Now that I know the process, I would come back again.",

    "text": "Before I start my review, a matter of full disclosure first: I am the contestant for this Genghis Grill's 2014 Health Kwest, a competition to lose weight over 60 days eating Genghis Grill once a day for each of those days. As part of this competition I do get a free bowl for those 60 days and must complete social media challenges for the possibility to win money at the end of the competition, one of the challenges is to complete a Yelp review. I will try to be as fair handed as possible.  This particular branch of Genghis Grill fell under new ownership a couple of months back and they have done wonderful work to update the look of the restaurant and up the skill of its employees, and it shows. The new bar and dining area are tasteful and the staff is excellent.   Over the past 48 days, I have become acquainted with a number of the staff who know me by name and are always pleasant. Allen, Andrew, and Mike have always been skilled behind the bar and make sure my stays are pleasant and my glass of water is never empty. Arnell and the grill staff are always hard at work and always make sure my bowls are well taken care of and never burned or under-cooked. David, Martika, Hailey, and Edwin have been some of the best servers, making sure my bowls are brought to the table quickly and always greet myself and any guests with a smile and great attitude.  The food here is what you make of it, quite literally. There is a variety of meats from beef and chicken to turkey and calamari. With plenty of seasonings and loads of vegetables the real struggle is to limit yourself so your flavor combination doesn't overpower itself. This is one area of criticism. While some recipe cards are offered at the line, there could definitely be more, showing how versatile a Mongolian stir fry can be. Given the combinations, you aren't limited to just an Asian inspired meal. You can branch out to an Italian pasta dish with pepperoni and red sauce. You can do some outstanding fajitas or even a manly beef and vegetable with barbeque sauce dish. I just wish they had 1) a salad bar and 2) a buffalo sauce so you could make a buffalo chicken and vegetable dish.  My only criticisms are minor and I really enjoy the establishment. And don't let people tell you these places are grossly unhealthy, if you do your bowl right and pay attention, they can be extremely good for you. Even my vegetarian mom loves this place.",

    "text": "Genghis Grill is one of my favorite restaurants!  I have always enjoyed the \"experience\" of Mongolian BBQ, and Genghis is as good as it gets!  If you're not familiar with this sort of experience, you get a bowl (three different sizes) and follow the steps:  step 1 - select your protein, step 2 - select your seasoning, step 3 - select your vegetables/ingredients, step 4 - select your sauce, and step 5 - select your starch.  Genghis Grill has over 80 ingredients (including a whole egg).    While I always get a regular size bowl, I sometimes upsize it to large and take home enough leftovers for 1-2 other meals.  To be honest, I have never ordered a signature bowl (not even the heart healthy bowl), mains, or salads.  I have only had an appetizer a few times (edamame) and a dessert once (cookie butter).  Otherwise, the bowls by themselves are more than filling!  You can make reservations on Open Table, take advantage of Khans Rewards (and their birthday program), and if you're an ASU student or staff member, show your Sun Card for a discount.  Happy hours are 3-6 PM Monday-Friday or 8 PM to close on Sunday-Thursday.  You can take advantage of different drink specials each day plus 1/2 price appetizers.  I miss the days when there were Genghis Grill locations all around the Phoenix area (which really was only a few years ago), and they used to have more discounts than they do today (including <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>).",

    "text": "My low review it's about the service I received today (06/16) and about our waiter Hayley, my food was great and I don't have any complaints about food value or flavor.  I met my family for dinner at Genghis, I have a young niece that had pizza and a kids drink from some other place for dinner; sometimes we get her Mac & Cheese but today she wanted pizza. We ordered our plates and drinks and by the time the bowl came to the table I basically had to \"guess\" if my bowl was my bowl because the waiter said the cooks had lost the name tag/receipt/little piece of paper with my name (no biggie it was my plate anyhow) I just found it inconvenient, what if it wasn't? That was problem #1  Problem #2 (and most important) We ate, we ordered separate checks and when mine comes it had a \"Kids drink on it\" I found it odd, but I was sure If I told my waiter she could take care of it. When she came and took the cards to process payment I said \"I believe you charged me for the kids drink but we brought that for her (my niece) from the pizza place\" the she says \"But you were putting soda on the cup RIGHT?!?(with a very accusatory tone)  so I replied \"Yes?!?! (very confused)\" This because YES I did put soda on my niece's cup very small cup maybe HALF cup because she finished her soda and my boyfriend SHARED his soda with her on her cup. So this mean she either was spying on us or somehow knew that I shared half cup of soda with my niece which I find very interesting and lame to be honest, to be watching what your customers do or don't. Actually I was also sharing my bowl with my boyfriend, am I going to be double charged because we shared the bowl??  Hayley (and I'm assuming this was her name because it was on the receipt) then explained to me that since it's free refills it's charged by each person so that's why I was charged since I was putting soda on another cup. She asked if it was ok to which I replied \"Yeah that's fine\" and proceed to pay $1.50 for sharing my drink with a kid. I mean, she already assumed and made me feel like I was stealing soda by sharing 1/2 cup so what could I do other than pay, RIGHT?!??!  Very disappointing experience since we are paying $40+ dlls to eat there I think $1.50 could've been spared, we even left a full refilled cup of soda that wasn't needed or consumed that I'm sure it went to waste. It's not that I was stealing the forks or any valuables, I mean you guys would've known since you were very attentive to what I was doing.   Anyways, problem #3, the floor is very sticky.",

No wonder why the 2 locations in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale shut down.   They have 2 size bowls and then give you a tray to hold your bowl. Use to be able to get as many eggs as possible and now are restricted to 2. Use to be able to get tortillas and now they charge you for them.   I understand why the owners changed things but if you take away things that your loyal customers had don't expect them to come back.  Before this place was a 5 stars, now they are a 3 star.   Don't like the new changes and don't know if i will come back.",

It doesn't take long, our bowls were brought out shortly. and OMG it was to die for! I savored every drop of that bowl. It was better than I thought it was going to be.  if you're not sure what you want, they have cards that suggesting you what you can mix up.

    "text": "The selection of meats is diverse and fresh, which is surprising for a Mongolian stir fry restaurant.  You have a choice of the typical fare: steak, pork, salami and crab, but Genghis also offers fresh calamari and shrimp.  You can also add several veggie choices and egg.  Yes, fried egg!  The sauces are all tasty and you can pick up a dish card that gives you paint by numbers ingredient instructions for those that don't want to concoct something on their own.  There are 5 noodle options and the cooks add those after you've given them your bowl of stuff-you don't have to balance your pyramid of noodles as is the case at YC's.    I've never had a bad bowl at Genghis.  In fact their fresh ingredients and friendly waitstaff make this one of my favorite eating spots in the Valley.  Ask your server for cheese and tortillas for your bowl.  If you consider it a challenge to stuff more and more into your bowl every time you go, make a bowl within a bowl with your meat selections.  Add your meat(s), contour the meat around the bowl and then add your other stuff.    They also have excellent daily drink specials, including a half off happy hour on Saturdays from 10PM 'til close.  I recommend getting any of their specialty drinks at that time.  *Tip*  Sign up for their Khan's Reward Card and earn free bowls and get a free bowl on your birthday.",

She'd never had Mongolian BBQ before!   Seating is a bit cramped, but ok. Our waiter (Travis) was fantastic. To our table really soon after getting seated. Asked if we'd ever been there (no) and took our drink order. Happy Hour (which is all day!) well drinks $2, score!   He then took us over the main area and told us what to do. I ended up with scallops and shrimp, seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic. Water chestnuts, onions, green onions, cilantro, mushrooms. Sauce was the honey soy. All over white rice.   Food came quickly and perfect cooked! The shrimp was tender and not dried out. The scallops were tasty too. The best part of Mongolian BBQ is that it is so hot when it comes out to you! Excellent flavor all around. My friend had the beef with the citrus sauce and enjoyed hers as well.   Best thing is they don't make you decide if you want the all you can eat or one bowl till the end. I thought for sure I'd want all I could eat, but I was full after one bowl.

    "text": "I've been to Genghis three or four times now, and each time it was delicious.    I feel I have to address a couple of the reviews that have been posted here.  First, there is Nadia's odd review about how \"gross\" for raw meat to be bloody.  Well, last time I checked, meat has blood.  Apparently she prefers frozen meat over fresh meat.  To each her own, but it seems a bit absurd.  Second, Jennifer \"reviewed\" the place without having actually eaten there, which strikes me as a bit closed minded and presumptuous.  I don't have the intuition to be able to judge a restaurant based on bowl size alone, but maybe she is just more talented than I.  On to the actual review... Genghis Grill is great.  Like I said, the meat is fresh, and there are several options: steak, chicken, turkey, pork, sausage, scallops, shrimp, cod, calamari, and probably some that I'm forgetting.  Oh, and did I mention that none of it is frozen?  After the meat, you are hit with a wide array of seasoning selections (Ashley mentioned that she would prefer sauces.  Apparently she didn't realize that there are also sauces at the end.).  Seasonings are necessary because they enhance the flavor, which is something that YC's could use.  My favorite is the Cajun seasoning.  Next you hit a wide variety of vegetables and other knicknacks.  There are almost too many choices; I have a hard time narrowing them down.  It also allows for different combinations; not all of your bowls have to be exactly the same each time.  Finally, you get to the sauces.  These sauces actually have flavor.    You also get a choice of what you want in the bowl with the stir fry; options include noodles and fried rice.    They also have strawberry lemonade, one of the rare restaurants with such an offering.  It is True that this place costs a little more than YC's, but it's worth it.  To those who say the bowl is small, sure, it's smaller than YC's, but when you add the rice or noodles, it fills you up, and you are limited at YC's by how much crap food you can stand to stomach.  There might be better Mongolian BBQs which I don't know about, but this place is legit.",

First off the recipes were sort of hidden and the line was moving way too fast so I couldn't search for them. Instead I ended up frantically putting on random spices and hoping it would taste good.   The waitress was really rude to us when we asked her questions about the location and restaurant. Since I didn't use an actual recipe my food was kind of gross.  If you want good mongolion go to YCs. If you're in Tempe Marketplace, skip this place and get some Slices or something.",

    "text": "Dear Friends who work at Genghis grill....you have seen me three times this week and although I am slightly burned out on your delicious Americanized \"Mongolian\" BBQ I must admit that you have become my new favorite mall fast food.  If you are unfamiliar with choosing your own adventure so to speak, it is a pretty good idea to go mild the first time and go easy on the complexity of your chosen dish.  My Fiancee and I are quite familiar with this sort of food and as such went hog wild and went for broke when piling up the topping and experimenting with the vast combinations of delicious entrees.  Here is our critique.  The Bad;  While overall delicious the sea food selection could use some work, scallops were very fishy (gross) calamari was still frozen, and the shrimp was bland and tasteless.  Took way too long to get both of our meals, one arrived well before the other all three times (read between 5 and 10 minutes) this is dissapointing  as it intrudes onto our date time as one of our meal ends up cold.  The Good;  Steak and Chicken seemed fresh not frozen (although couldnt be sure) tasted pretty good for an inexpensive meal.  Noodles and rice were fantastic!  Terryaki Sauce and Garlic Sauce were a touch salty but again very good all things considering  Staff were very friendly polite, and speedy.  No wait times on drinks or to be seated even when it was quite crowded.  Overall room for improvement but still quite a good little meal if your waiting for a movie.  We will be back several times I am sure.",

    "text": "I've eaten here a few times and I've really enjoyed it. This last time though has made me reconsider. My dad was visiting from out of town and I thought this was the perfect place because he loves building his own dishes and he has a big appetite. When we arrived the restaurant wasn't too busy, no one was up at the hostess stand so we waiting to be seated, only about 5 minutes until we were greeted. Our food came out fast, almost too fast. My food was fine, but my dad was saying he didn't think it was cooked all the way through. Our waiter was nowhere to be found, our waters stayed empty. Finally, he came around and we both asked for more noodles, something I do every time I come. The side he brought was so small, definitely smaller than I'm used to. When we got the bill we were charged 1.99 each for the side of noodles! Not worth 2 bucks...and I've never been charged when I ask for extra every other time I've been there. The whole reason I went there over YC's is because you can get extra. I don't know if I got lucky every other time, or he just charged us to charge us. Either way, if you want more starch, make sure you ask if it's extra. Total was $28 for our 2 medium bowls and 2 sides of noodles. When we went to pay our waiter was standing over us as we took out the money and was very quick to get us out. I felt rushed. My dad was very disappointed and thought the food was just OK. Probably could have received a more quality meal for 28 bucks. Not sure if I'll be back...definitely won't recommend. My dad isn't hard to please, so if he's not happy, you know there's a problem.",

    "text": "I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I'm not happy with my decision and I'm thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I'm no stranger to \"Mongolian BBQ\" as I've been a long-time fan of YC's. Obviously I'm going to compare the two.   I liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC's, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it's wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It's just different though - I wouldn't say frozen is better, just that I prefer it.   I would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin's outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC's, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC's hands down in the available food department.  And taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn't any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I'd say YC's is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG's I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences.   The ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC's (depending on which one you go to) is a \"no frills\" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.  Service was attentive, but odd since this is a \"get your own food\" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it's a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.  I think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin's... but then again, you aren't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC's - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there's the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC's (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl.   So I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn't had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC's... Impressive.",

Due to the loud ambiance from Genghis we decided to try it.  I am sorry we did.  The flavor of the food was terrible and I ended up with a stomach ache later that night.  I took most the food home and offered it up to my kids and friends but after one bite no one wanted more.  Ended up throwing it away. We decided to try their next door neighbor the next week we went to Tempe Market Place.  Wow, I was so impressed with the food there.  The night staff were great too.  So I suggest to anyone interested in some quality Japanese food, keep walking past Genghis and go next door.",

So much so I have earned a \"free\" bowl 2 times from my frequent dinner card. I wouldn't hesitate to eat at GG anytime..   I also like that there are more choices for powered spices, as well as liquid sauces. YC's pales in comparison!!  I have never had a problem with staff here and they seem friendly enough.  They have Coke products which is always a must have and a plus!!  Sure GG is a little more than YC's, but remember you get what you pay for!!",

    "text": "In all fairness to the reader and to this establishment, let me start out by saying I did not actually end up eating at this place.  Read on to find out why...  I LOVE mongolian stir-fry places - all of the cooking without having to buy the ingredients, clean up afterwards, etc. - so I was completely stoked to go to this place.  Unfortunately, after trudging through the rain this past Sunday night to get there, Genghis Grill was not the oasis I had hoped for.  I stepped out of the rain and into an equally dreary locale with lights that somehow gave the place a weird cafeteria-like aura.  The only way to describe the atmosphere is to say there is no atmosphere.  The grilling area, which you'd think would be the main focal point of a place called Genghis Grill, was all the way in the back and was completely deserted.  NO ONE was actually filling bowls up with food or having stuff grilled, which made me wonder how long all of the ingredients had been sitting there.    Averting my gaze from the sad cooking area, my eyes fell upon a random assortment of questionably groomed older people, with the odd straggly haired teenager thrown into the mix.  And why the flat-screen tvs on the walls?  It's not that I don't appreciate nice flat-screen tvs, but at a mongolian barbeque they just seemed a little...out-of-place.  The whole scene was just unappetizing, so we decided to go and find a more appealing place to dine (namely, Chipotle, which incidentally had a lot more atmosphere and was not deserted).  The comic relief was when I told the waiter we had \"to go,\" and he replied \"Oh, you can pick that up at the bar\" - to which I clarified \"No- I mean we're leaving.\"  Probably never to return, unless I come to hear that maybe this was just an \"off\" night for the Genghis Grill...",

While I was filling up my sauce the manager came up behind me and told me everything had to fit in the bowl (I had placed 2 eggs in a tin cup) I said oh well that's a new rule I never had to do that before. The manager said no it has always been that way and I responded NO it has not actually and he proceeded to tell me that now he is running this place and why it's not going bankrupt. I then had enough of our arguing back and forth and asked how much extra for an egg and he told me $2 per extra egg... which is absolutely insane when you can buy an entire carton for $2!!!! I finally gave up and made a nest on top of my bowl for the egg.  When I sat my waiter Jong was fantastic no complaints on him but throughout my meal the manager kept giving me dirty looks and made me feel very uncomfortable. He never came over to the table or any table for that matter just glared around the restaurant the whole time I was there.    Still love the food  and service from waiter but disappointed in new manager and his ridiculous price on an extra egg and the experience vibe he gave me, very unprofessional.",

I am a loyal customer who has brought several friends, family members, and co workers there - who themselves are now loyal customers. I have their rewards card, and I probably have received over 30 free bowls (including my birthday bowl) because of how much I enjoy eating at this place. You get to make your bowl the way you want to, with fresh products - or have one of the pre-made dishes off the menu. I encourage you to get the medium bowl, since I think the small bowl is geared more towards children. You go down the line and pick out your proteins, then seasoning, veggies, and sauces. Finally you let the cooks know which starch you would like to have with your meal, and then you can pick up crunchies or cut up peanuts to put on the final product. You then sit down at your table, and wait for the staff to bring you your meal. They have appetizers and desserts to choose from, along with a vast amount of alcoholic drinks to choose. The staff is friendly and outgoing people, who will assist with your experience if it is your first time. Mike, who has been there since the place opened, remembers us every time we come in and always finds time to say hello to us. The only criticism I have to give, are the tongs for the food. When they first opened the tongs they had were great! Now, you have to try to pick up the food multiple times because they either don't pick up the food, the food falls off, or you can't get enough of the item on the tongs. This small thing, can boggle down the lines.",

Pro's of Genghis is that there are more meat, veggie and carb options, but you get a WAY smaller bowl to begin with. YC's cooks your food when you're standing there and  then you take it to your table, Gengis has you go to your table, then they serve it to you. This didn't work very well when there was a group of six of us and there was about a 20 minute wait form when the first bowl came out and the last.  Basically, the food is great, depending on what you make. Price is a bit high and the wait is a bit long. I would suggest coming here in a Wednesday afternoon with no more than two in a party.",

The options are great for vegetarians and meat eaters (seafood, chicken, or red meat) the way they have it set up for the meats first is perfect so all the greens are the toppers makes it easier to truly build the perfect bowl. They have around 20 different sauces to add to the flavor at the end of the line prior to picking your choice of maybe 8 different noodles or rice to add to everything else. At the end you hand them this bowl of your desire, go sit at your table enjoying an ice cold beer or soda while the crazy team of stir fry guys heat up and mix all your toppings.",

The night I went to YC's might have been badly chosen due to the car show, but unfortunately is was completely packed, and though I have no problems with people packing their bowls to the gills and  enjoying that all you can eat experience I really didn't care much for the quality of the food and the limited choice of rice as well as the fact that their meats were frozen and shaved....on the other hand my girlfriend and I were a bit tired of heading to Chipotle as much as we love it and decided to try it out. I'll admit that I could give it 5 stars (on the food alone) but several factors do come into play. I find the seating partially awkward. Against the wall you have people sort of gazing down on you if you choose a table and then the TV screens for those who care to watch a game,etc while eating seem to be placed too high. On a good note, you have a larger selection of rice and noodles than YC's and the meats are more appetizing as well as the veggies. I also liked the numerous sauces offered though I'm a pretty vanilla type sauce person myself. The service can be a bit awkward in my previous visits with refills indeed taking some time and I have to feel bad for the waiters who have a limited amount of work to do since clients basically choose their own menu barring some dessert choices that I haven't nor may I ever choose to take. All in all it was my first \"Mongolian grill\" experience and left me impressed and more than willing to give it a thumbs up to friends and strangers alike.",

The hostess showed us our table and explained how things worked, and a gentleman came to take our drink orders. Think he was the manager, he checked up on us multiple times as well as everyone else in the place.  We took our cards with us and got in line. It got busy as everyone else seemed to join us at the same time. We chose our bowl size and got a tray and two small cups for our sauces. You move down the line and add protein, spices, veggies and other toppings. The guy in front of us was clearly a pro as he was stuffing his bowl and pushing down the contents like there was no tomorrow. But he took forever so that was annoying and I bypassed him. Love that they had several seafood options as well as tofu to suit my pescatarian diet. At the end, one of the cooks takes our card and asks if we'd like noodles and/or rice and how many eggs (2 for a regular bowl). I asked for both noodles and rice but only got noodles, so that was a small bummer but the noodles were good.   Overall I put way too much sauce and white fish but it was surely a filling meal. Next time I'll have to follow the guidelines for specific sauces cuz I was just adding everything that sounded good. It ended up being on the sweet side but the manager came through with some Sriracha sauce.",

A few of my favorite sauce combos: If you like it spicy try the Cajun seasoning with dragon sauce   If you like it garlicky try the garlic sauce with garlic salt   If you like it spicy and tangy go with the kangpoa   If you like it sweet to with teriyaki and sweet and sour sauce.   If you're trying to be healthy instead of rice or noodles go with cabbage (what u always go for).   There is quiet endless options here. You can never go wrong. My favorite is the Cajun chicken and sausage! I always get those. At dinner time I always throw in some shrimp.   As you can see I can go on and on about this place and how good it is but the only way to really know is give it a try yourself!",

I wasn't expecting to have to come up with my own ingredient choices for my stir-fry, and was a little intimidated at first, but I think they make it hard for you to go wrong. My stir-fry came out better than I thought it would, it was delicious, and pretty cool since I chose the ingredients myself. Although I had a great time just by myself, I could see this restaurant as great for a date or fun with friends and family. Would recommend.",

I just got off work and was waiting for my friend to arrive. I ordered 2 mimosa's from your employee Alexandra I started having a friendly conversation with someone else who was sitting at the bar.. a complete stranger.. we was talking about Michael Jackson. How he went broke.. and his court cases of he was innocent.. we was laughing. Then one of your employees came up to me and said there was a child around can I watch my swearing. I apologize  and said sorry I had no idea a kid was around. That was it. I then asked Alexandra if I can have another mimosa. She said NO MY MANAGER CUT YOU OFF\" I said why is that.. she said I don't know. I said well can you get your manager. She did. He comes over with a very bad attitude.. I asked him hey why did u cut me off.. he said I don't have to ask my employer why u was cut off that I trust them and if she says your done than I stand behind there choice. I said oh ok that's funny because she said u cut me off. So which one is it..he said it doesn't matter. I said yes it does I would like 2 know why after 2 I was cut off.. I said I wasn't yelling. When u guys asked me to watch my language I did. So I would like to know why.. he said u need to leave. I said why.. he called securuty.. I then asked for his name and the bartenders name. He said heres name I will not give u hers.. I was like wow.. so security showed up. I recused to leave until they gave me the 2 names needed to report to corporate.. or until the police arrived.. which they did.i wasnt arrested.. or anything. I was embarrassed and humiliated I been an employee  at my job going on 11 years in corporate office and the treatment that I received was less than customer satisfaction.",

The location for this place is really good because it gets alot of foot traffic so you will see this place packed at almost all times.  I like this place better then its competitors in AZ because it caters to the nightlife eaters with Sake bombs and other drink specials.  The selection of meat and vegetables is great and you will find yourself stuck between making several dishes.  I think that if they droped the price of the all you can eat, people would be happier as they would make smaller portions of different things...but right now it feels like everyone crams as much as possible into one bowl.  I recommend this place, but its nothing you have to rush out to right this instant.",

Once I had my frozen (mixed with soggy and old) meats, I moved on and sat down. Our waiter was not attentive or energetic at all, it seemed like he hated his job which brought down our enthusiasm.

They have delicious food to choose from, great drink prices (especially during happy hour), and spot-on service. Not much bad to say about this place other than that I'm partial to \"my\" Mongolian bbq place.  A while ago, the restaurant next door closed down (like literally in the middle of a day) so they still had food out and everything. Something happened with the drains since they weren't able to fully clean up before shutting down and the whole place smelled like the worst possible odor you can imagine. Unfortunately for Genghis, the smell seeped into their restaurant which totally, totally sucked. I almost walked out when I walked in one day until the server explained all this to me from the start-to-finish and then apologized as if he created the stench himself. For that service, we endured the smell and stayed because we wanted to support the business. The plumbing has since been corrected and the place smells better than ever. It's also fun to bring my dog here and eat at the outside tables. Come here over Bar Louie.",

Knowing that they were closing in fifteen minutes we made sure to communicate to each other to make the process as quick as possible. When we we arrived we were greeted by annoyance. We could all tell that we were unwelcome and that most of the workers were talking about us. Some of us had never been here so we asked questions and were answered with obvious sarcasm. A little disgruntled we still decided to eat. So we went through the line and made our bowl and when it came to the point of grilling, because no one explained anything to us, one of my coworkers had put sauce on top of her bowl and was advised that her food would be rinsed or else it would burn. Ummmm.... so then I ask if we should wait for the food to be cooked to take it to the table and get a a sarcastic \"sure but we bring it to your table anyways\". I literally almost lunged at him. So holding myself back I went and sat at the table. My coworker ordered a drink and 2 minutes later we were told the bar was closed earlier but they'd still make it. Why tell us if it was going to be made anyways? To make sure we knew that we were an inconvenience? As we are eating, my coworker (vegetarian), picks out a shrimp out of her food... which she obviously she did not put in there. She did not mind, they were lucky, but I would have. To top it off we were waiting for them to take the checks and they decided to turn the music off and turn the lights as bright as they could go. Extremely disappointed. They definitely will not be receiving our service ever again. We all enjoy food and fortunately our work brings in a lot of visitors from other countries and states so we will definitely let them know where not to go! The only part that was a light out of this dark experience was Daisy. She had a great attitude and apparently realized customer experience was important no matter the time. YCS FOR LIFE!",

Ordered a small, 11.88 after tax, plus this is a service restaurant so add tip (or don't). I just finished my meal, I'm out 12.88 and still hungry as hell. A large will set you back 15$ and isn't as big as YCs small that only cost 8.95. Plus you get free soft serve at YC! Won't be back",

    "text": "I went to this place for lunch today with a friend. It was really nothing that I would run back for. I think the goodness level kind of depends on you, as you add the ingredients, including seasonings, sauces, veggies, meat, and starch. I think the instructions could be more clearly displayed. First you see meat, then you come upon dry spices.... I thought this was going to be the only flavor source for the food, so I used too much.... if I go again (big if) I would choose maybe just ginger or something. I used a bunch of garlic, only to find fresh garlic later down the line. Curses!   They do have a good selection of veggies that seem fairly fresh. The meat is real cut up meat, not that weird freeze dried meat that is used at some of these places. I thought their choice of noodle is a bit weird... udon.... kind of thick and slimy... I would have picked like soba noodles or rice noodles or something. That wasn't a huge issue, but just something I thought was weird. I had them put the chili garlic sauce mixed with kung pao mixed with a hint of peanut sauce... turned out fairly good.   Also, it is a bit pricey, especially when you only get to go up once, so you can only make one sauce decision.... if you screw up, you're kind of screwed. Also, other places allow you to get soup and rice or something with the entree.... that would be nice considering what they charge. If someone suggested it again, I would go, but I wouldn't go back on my own.",

When our server came, she took our drink orders (good looking drink menu by the way) but failed to explain the ordering process. When we asked how to order our food, she pointed to the line and explained that we fill a bowl ourselves with what we want in the stir fry, then circle what kind of rice we want on a little card. We walked over to the line and were handed a tray with a stainless steel bowl for the create your own stir fry. The tray felt sticky. Gross. The meat section was first, and there were pieces of raw chicken that people had dropped in a bunch of other containers. Then I witnessed the man in line in front of us use his fingers to push the ground meat off of the tongs and into his bowl before returning the tongs back to the tray of meat. No thank you. The carrots looked like they'd been sliced days ago, all soft looking. Ultimately I put my tray back and decided not to dine here. Will not return.",

    "text": "Usually when I go to one of these Mongolian wok type places, I leave with a box and a half to go. On the other hand, this one was more expensive and I was still hungry by time I left. The bowl was tiny, the sides were limited, and the sauces were pre-made, pasty, 'meh'. In addition to that, the service was terrible. My drink didn't get refilled even once, and my friend's food sat on the line for ten~fifteen minutes before they decided to bring it over to her. And the restaurant was pretty much empty other than our table, and two or three others, so it's not like they were super busy or something. There was a group of waiters standing around the entire time, chatting obnoxiously loud and basically ignoring us, while one other girl did all the work.   Pro's: Fresh ingredients, large variety of FRESH meats (a lot of these types of places do frozen), decent spice section, high quality ingredients in general, clean/pretty restaurant.   Con's: Way overpriced. Tiny portion sizes. (The bowl was shockingly small to begin with, when I got it. And then it was obviously designed to have a really thick bottom to make it even shallower, as well as a wide brim - which is cheap on the restaurants part, and kind of tasteless, in my opinion.) Lackluster sauces. Horrible service. Oh, and this is more of a personal preference, but they only had udon noodles and two rice types for what you wanted as your 'side', i.e the thing mixed into your stir-fry. Everything else was atypical stuff like tortilla strips and things of that nature. Not to hate on fusion foods or anything, but if I'm going to get Asian food, I'd like more Asian selections, haha.   These Mongolian Grill restaurants are always expensive. However, it's because you're paying for the fact that you get to eat a huge amount of food. I mean, it's just stir-fry. It's rice and vegetables for the most part. Yummy? Yes. High cuisine? Not so much. Worth sit-down prices? In this case, definitely not.  There aren't a lot of Mongolian places in AZ, but this one is at the bottom of the totem pole, in my opinion. I suggest heading elsewhere.",

My fiance and I thought we would go out for an early dinner. We had three different servers before our food came out, then our food arrives and my bowl is burnt to a crisp. A fourth server comes over and asks how everything is, we tell them that my food os burnt (were not rude as these things happen). She goes to get the manager and one manager comes over and tells me I can go make another bowl and with an attitude tells me he wont charge me for the bowl they burned. As I am getting up another manager comes over and tries blaming me for my food being burned as if it was my fault.  After I re-ordered my bowl, we were then given a 5th server who was actually quite nice and said when he asked management if they were going to do anything for us since they burned my food and my fiance and I had to eat separately, they said no.  We were not expecting a free meal, discount or anything of the sorts, but the fact that management was so rude and never apologized but rather tried to blame me for my food being burned is beyond me. How management can be so careless and ignorant towards a paying customer and try blaming them for burning their own food is beyond me.   Because of this, we will no longer be eating here.",

Their happy hour is great have Monday-Friday 3-6, $2 wells, mimosas, beers, sakes, you name it! And then a Reverse happy hour Sunday-Thursday 8-close. The meat is always fresh and the cook Alex did a great job on my bowl. Very flavorable and perfectly tempted. I always sit at the bar though with my favorite guy Michael. He is so down to earth , very professional and easy going. You'll definitely want to eat and drink with him. My whole family has been here with him by now! Great place to eat guys. Will always be a favorite. Without Michael i can definitely say, my visits wouldn't be the same and i would be a disappointed customer not seeing him around for whatever reason.",

She wanted to go to GG and I haven't been there before so I'm always willing to try new places  Walked in and they greeted us right away. Got a table right by the grill. Interesting place. They have a bar area and a grill area but nothing about the place stood out to me.   So I found out that they have little tags at the table that you bring to the grill. So you basically give them you name and your bowl size then get your bowl and fill it with meat and veggies. Fill it as high as possible. So many possibilities. They give you a small cup for your sauce that you pick out too. Then it's off to the grill and since I got a medium bowl you get two choices of your carbs. Noodles, rice, and even tortillas. I just basically got brown rice. Anyways, when it's done they bring your bowl to your table.   So the bowl was pretty good. Fresh veggies and fresh meat. It's a pretty good concept. Enjoyed the food and the relaxing environment. Wouldn't mine going back. Enjoy.",

U come in, get a little card, go to the food part, someone fills the card out for u and u just go through the food line and add what u would like in ur bowl, for example i got cajun chicken, broccoli, pineapple, bean sprouts, added some cajun seasoning as well as lemon pepper, added some teriyaki sauce, and at the end u get to pick if u want noodles, fried rice ect, then they make ur bowl and it gets brought to u. It was delicious !! Worth it all the way!! Everyone was also very friendly! If u haven't been there they wont hesitate to help u!",

Once seated, you take a little slip of paper that you bring to the BYOB (build your own bowl) counter, which dictates how much stuff you can put in your bowl. The person manning the station was super helpful, giving us tips on what the sauces were like. I also loved that you get fined if you move backwards down the line. They didn't say why, but i saw that the bar went from chicken to beef to fish to veggies (Yay food safety!)   Because of how I built my bowl, there wasn't too much sauce, which I was a bit sad about. The flavors were good (get the spicy beef!), though the \"udon\" noodles weren't quite right-I was so excited because I love udon, but this wasn't real udon. That was the most disappointing part :(",

After the waiter seated us, he explained what we were suppose to do and left to get our drinks.  Each costumer goes to the counter where there are 3 size of bowls to choose from and tons of ingredients for the desired meal. Once all items are in the bowl, the cook takes care of the rest and the food is served at the table shortly after. For whatever reason, I always forget that my eyes are bigger than my stomach so I get too much food. This was the case at Genghis as well, however I enjoyed my food choice.",

Located at Tempe Market Place in the Casual food row, Genghis offers full service and a full bar, and with a menu that sports appetizers, deserts and specialty cocktails. 3 sizes of bowls with a buck off each for lunch, and the apps are pretty solid. Today I had the chicken lettuce wraps and for the first time ever someone is making them better then PF Chang's, they are different but better. I re-ordered them today(2 orders) something I rarely do in a restaurant.  I almost hate to mention that this is one of my very favorite secret Happy Hour spots with amazing daily specials and super cheap drinks and beers 3-6. Oh and those lettuce wraps are half off to, I think all of the apps are half price.  Round this out with stellar service all around and a manager present working the floor with the staff. There are not enough places doing it right like Genghis Grill does!",

I like putting together my own meal with the meat, veggies and starch I like. The food is well prepared and quite tasty. I looked at the reviews and have had much better luck with the service; it's been very good for us, never a problem.   There have been a few recent changes. There are now three bowl sizes to choose from, and the effect is that to get the same size as before, it costs a few dollars more. While the place is a good lunchtime restaurant, it is a just a bit pricey now for this location. Also, there's a computer tablet at the table. The servers are helpful in showing how to navigate this, although I'm not that high tech so don't really feel the need for this.   Overall, I like the place and will continue to go there when in the area to meet a friend for a movie. I find it better than the other restaurants at this mall location.",

The great thing about this place is you get to customize your own stir fry! Meat, veggies, spices and sauces! If you like a spicy sweet sauce, do two full cups of soy, and a cup half garlic water and half khazu sauce. You can't beat it. I use that on chicken spiced with dragon salt and Cajun. Spinach, onions, bell pepper, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, pineapple... It's addicting.  Generally, service is great. I've only had one problem with this place. The last time I came here, I got food poisoning. I was so sad and contacted Genghis to let them know the situation. They handled it nicely and offered me drinks, entree, app, and dessert on them, but I moved. I probably wouldn't have used it anyway since that's not how I roll. Obviously they valued me as a customer though, so that is nice in itself! I would go back here someday even though I died that one time from FP. That is how much I love this place.   Also, Genghis is way better than YC's. Yep, I said it.",

    "text": "I've been here twice before, most recently 4 months ago. We really liked it as a standard Mongolian BBQ. However, I went last night and was disappointed. They've switched to small, med, and large bowl options which is an OK idea, but the small is $8.99 and TINY. All of the handles for scoop ingredients were filthy and sticky up to the tips of the handles. They added tasting spoons for sauces (again good idea), but the flavors of the sauces were lacking and homogeneous, with many being honey-something or other. Someone mentioned new owners, which may explain the changes.  The only high point was our waitress, Victoria I believe, who was amazing! However, her awesome serving skills weren't enough for me to plan to come back.",

He was super rude to me and my friends on multiple occasions, and said the same thing that he apparently said to anoter reviewer on here. Something along the lines of \"well that's why the other owners went bankrupt, and things are different now.\" The food is still good, but they did increase the drink prices. It just doesn't seem as busy and laid back as it used to be. More of corporate feel now.  We love the concept so we'll probably be back, but miss the previous owners",

    "text": "OK - so an update to my previous post.  After posting my review about a month ago, a member of the ownership team emails me and informs me of changes within the company, and asks me to give Genghis Grill another chance.  I am glad that I did.  Before introducing myself to the manager, the attitude of the staff was 100% different.  Everyone was polite, attentive and really was concerned about the customer experience.  Hostesses, servers, even the guy at the buffet line were all great.  The food was much improved too!  The building no longer smelled like spoiled chicken (one of our warning signs last time), all the food in the buffet line was fresh, and when we received our food, it was cooked perfectly.    While eating the manager came up and first thanked us for our review, and explained the standards in place, including how they prepared food (a far cry from the previous manager - who is no longer there).  Our food took a little bit longer to cook, but that's a great thing - we knew that the extra time meant (a few minutes) meant the food was prepared properly.  I want to thank AJ, Ash, and everyone at Genghis Grill for the improvement, and restoring my faith in a restaurant that my wife and I loved.  We will definitely be back!",

First I will say the food is fresh and I really enjoy the mongo BBQ sauce. It's spicy, but very tasty. Genghis is over-priced, so don't be shocked by the bill. Also, paying tip for someone that just brings you drinks is a little hard to justify. This location is no good! Today my table was numbered incorrectly and there was some confusion on delivering my tables bowls. Secondly, being a rewards member I received two emails offering me a two for $25 deal. The manager would not accept the email for the reason that it was only for their arrowhead location. Uh ok. So am I only a rewards member for one location? This is horrible service. After being a loyal customer I feel this deal should have been accepted. So I won't be going there again.",

    "text": "*Be careful if you have allergies, the cooks don't read your instructions*  I've been to the tempe location of genghis grill several times, and it's a refreshing change from the usual mongolian grill places like YC's. I appreciate the fact that they have brown rice, and healthier options, you can go all veggie, you can go all meat, it has equal parts food for everyone to enjoy. The offering of shrimp and calamari is nice too, few asian bbqs offer anything good, just frozen white fish.  My problem with this location is that the people running the grill are not careful enough and I doubt their grasp of the english language. In any other case I would not care who speaks what, but when it comes to actual concerns about food ALLERGIES, the guys cooking the food, to your instructions, should understand what you said and take it seriously  The last time I went here I was with a group, I put my dish together with what I like, and I never add any of the flavored sauces, their sauces have ingredients that I am allergic to. When your done you go up to the counter and you tell the cooks what starch you want,  and you can even write on a special request card about allergies, and any requests. I wrote down allergies, clean stove   You'd think that cooks in charge of people's food, with a guests' allergies in mind would understand that it is important and watch their work. Nope. I got my bowl, it smelled sweet, and it was visibly darker than usual, I had my friend take a bite and it was for sure cooked in sweet teriyaki sauce, the bowl was ruined for me and the line was now long and huge, I'd have to wait 20 minutes to get back to dinner if I went back in line. Lame.  Presented the problem to a manager, and the reply I got was this: \"Ohh there's sauce, we can wash it off real quick with hot water, you won't taste it\", I reminded the manager that this was an allergy, you can't wash it off, and I was offered a new bowl and to cut in line in front of everyone. Okay, nice enough fix, the manager did what they could to fix it after the fact, but it was a cruddy experience.  When I tell a cook in plain english that I have an allergy, and even write it down on a card for them to read while doing their job, and they don't do it, how do you trust them after that? Lame. I'm never coming back to this location ever.  Otherwise, it's a fine place to chill...they just need to clean up the serving ladels and spoons, those things are sticky...gotta sanitize towel that stuff.",

Sadly, the employees are the ones that suffer.  On a scale of 1 to 5, common courtesy of the staff is a one. Our server, did not explain exactly how their system worked in the ordering of the food. We waited in line, when we got to the staff member with the tray and bowls, she asked for our card....  In order to get your food your server gives you a card, ours did not. The staff member made us get out of line and go back and get our cards. This seemed quite ridiculous, I suggested that we just fill out new cards.  The food was great! The service was terrible, the response from the owner was surprising as he acted like he could really care less about our experience. The whole point of going out, is the experience, it is not just the food. There are so many great places to eat in Tempe that has great food and offers a great experience. This place does NOT do that.",

It was our first time eating here, and the waiter was very kind and explained the process of ordering (you can either order one of their signature bowls or customize your dish by filling out a card and taking it to the stir fry line). Since we didn't have much time, we ordered the Chicken Teriyaki, Mongolian Steak, and Sesame Beef signature bowls.   It didn't take too long to get our food, but I was a bit surprised by the relatively small size of the bowls. Nonetheless, the Chicken Teriyaki was tasty with a little kick of pineapple. The dish was a tad oily, and my family also commented on the oiliness (is that a word?) of their bowls. I personally believe that the price ($10-$12) is too much for the small bowl, but the patient waiter and good family time made up for that.   In the future, I'd like to try customizing my own bowl!",

One quibble that we both had is that it is extremely difficult to reach the sauces in the back row. However both of our meals were quite delicious and cooked to perfection.

Once your seated, you are given a card and you head to the food line. Choose your size bowl, and build it from base up. Lots of protein options, tons of veggies, different sauces, and finish it with noodles, rice, etc. It is then cooked on a large wok and brought to your table when finished. They do have a menu with food options but I always build my own!   My hubby love to get a side of tortillas to enjoy his dinner with and I usually get a side of white rice. Tons of seating including a bar with a tv for watching sports. Our service was good - super friendly and quick to bring anything we needed. Be prepared to wait if you come around dinner service especially on weekends, but it's never a super long wait.",

Once you have those, you fill your bowl with all ingredients that you want in your stir fry, and you hand off the bowl. They then bring it out to you.   If you do it right, this place is a better option that YC's. For me, I like to stack the meats, and I definitely get my money's worth. If you like more of a balance of veggies and noodles, then YC's may be the move.   Either way, food tastes great (sauces better than YC's, and more variety) and the staff was great. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Pretty cool concept, you get to create your own bowl. You assemble into a line and choose your own toppings yourself. Such as the meat, spices, veggies, sauces, etc. You can stack it as much as you can fit inside the bowl (small, regular, large). At the end you choose TWO bases for example fried rice, steamed rice, noodles, cabbage, brown rice etc. And at the very end of the line they cook your bowl on the grill. And you sit down and the waiter/waitress will bring you your food. Delicious! Wide range of endless options for sure.   My bowl was SPICY and slightly TANGY. It wasn't too spicy btw, just a small kick, enough to enjoy easily :) CAJUN CHICKEN with a little SAUSAGE, corn, zucchini, squash, green onions, carrots, brocolli, salt, garlic seasoning with DRAGON SAUCE. I had it cooked with FRIED RICE and STEAM RICE.   Good service, manager on duty checked on us frequently as well as the waitress.   So delicious I would definitely come back! So quick, so filling yummy place overall :)",

The first experience wasn't nearly as bad or we wouldn't have come back but now it's time to warn others.  1st this is not cheap.  The small bowl is $12.49, reg 14.49 and large $15.99.  To put that in perspective, my husband and I typically share meals.  Here, he gets regular and I get small.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly enough.  You may wait a little, but nothing terrible.  The buffet bar itself has food everywhere.  Several items that are dropped in the containers of food.  Which is understandable.  But there is no one maintaining it.  There are several men at the grill and the area is filthy.  One guy was pouring a bucket of dirty dishes into another bucket on the floor.  A couple fell out.  One of the cooks stepped away from cooking.  With his gloved hand, picked the bowl up off the floor, tossed it in the bucket that is on the floor and then stepped back to cooking.  It was mentioned to the guy who asked us for sides and he did ask him to change his gloves.  Trying to eat lighter I got the chicken.  It was so spongy (assume fillers) and had so much fat and connective tissue still attached, I couldn't eat it.",

The original location I visited was years ago at the paradise valley mall area, which has since closed. Good to know this establishment is still around ! I love how you can make your own bowl and smash as much as you like to appease your cravings. I honestly don't quite remember what i mixed in my medium bowl besides the main ingredients of steak and scallops. I do know I added garlic , greens if some kind and had to have an egg mixed with my fried rice as the chefs go to work frying my concoction to this meal you see attached ! Great to see that genghis is still around !",

Was in town for spring training this past week and I HAD to stop in at Genghis, as it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I used to go in at least once a week for the food and my favorite server/bartender Mike. I was happy to see he was still there when we went in and still giving the impecable service he did when I lived out there. If I could steal him and make him move to Cali, I would. He's that good.  I was shocked when I walked in, because they have completely redesigned this location. I thought it was classy and beautiful. The upgrades they have made seem to be working in their favor.  Go in and ask for Mike if he's working. You won't be sorry.",

Always ask if you been here if you haven't they'll throw down the spill! But once you get seated, you go up and pick your size bowls, 3 bowls small, medium and of course large! First time here oh say? I'd stick with the medium you'll either eat it all or have some leftovers! You pick your protein from sea food too meat meat! A column of vegetables also; and then seasoning! They also have side cards in case you can't pick out your own or create your recipe! Last but not least is the sauce from basic soy to a yummy dragon sauce! Which is amazing! Then pick your side aka, base carb like rice to even spaghetti noodles I think they also do lettuce wraps too so it's evolving as time goes by! Drink specials are awesome and they have a great happy hour, all very daily as well! Hungry from shopping or trying to escape the heat? Come here! Well, stay hungry Arizona !",

So I went, hesitant.   Walked in and it was a different experience this time! The floors & tabletops were not sticky and the counter top was clean.  I was starting to enjoy myself.  So started to make my bowl, I went with the festive chicken and steak, decided that I will follow whatever my heart desires, added a mix of sliced bell peppers and onions, then some mushrooms, jalapenos, pico de gallo (note to self, don't add that again, it has chopped baby corns which freak me out, cuz really were is corn growing only 3 inches long and as skinny as a pen), green onions, some cabbage? Tossed in some red chili flakes and hit it with more spice and fiery hot sauce before turning it over to the grill got it with some fried rice. That was some heaven right there, delish I tell you!!  The one who wound up cooking my food on the grill even told me man that looks and smells great!   Ok I can say I am glad to have gone back a 2nd time and most likely will be back again.",

So much you'd be so undecided on what to choose. Was in town visiting family and ended up coming TWICE! Here is my take and how why both visits are worthy of a rare 5 star:  1.) THE MEAT: This is one of the best parts. From what I recall, they have Chicken, Spicy Chicken, Fish, Steak, Beef, Bacon, Pepperoni, Crab, Eggs, and a few other things that I forget. Everything looked very fresh!   2.) TASTE TEST YOUR FLAVORS! You can taste as many sauces as you'd like, and you can mix them. If you're not sure try them! This is not your typical Mongolian, they have sauces like Kung Pao and Teriyaki which is all you really need if you want that type of a dish.  3.) INDECISIVE? DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START? No worries. In the beginning of the line, they have fun recipe cards you can use and to help you start so then if you're looking to put in your flavor...you can play around with it. Think of it as an inspiration card.  4.) CHOOSE YOUR STARCH: I usually go with the brown rice. I love that that they have brown rice and I'm sure you healthy eaters will too. Think it's not enough? You can get it on cabbage as well to be extra lean!  5.) SUPER COOL TOUCH PAD: Here, you can split your tab with your lunch date and fun touch pad games while waiting. You can order drinks which we did one night during dinner; it was delivered FAST!  **I love that this brings an opportunity to just get creative. You can be really interactive with it. The place has a great ambiance to hang out and have fun! We will be back anytime we are in AZ.",

They have quite a selection of different Meats and I tried three different kinds and they were all superb! They have a large selection of sauces and mix ins and it has to be the best stir-fry I've ever had. Highly recommend this place I think it's already become our new favorite after one visit.",

(i signed up to their club and got a free birthday bowl!). some of what i mixed in was some chicken, marinated steak, pork, beef, celery, peppers, with a crazy concoction of spicy sauces. i cant wait to get home and chow on the rest!  those wacky mongolians really know whats up. its really that simple.",

Concocting the sauce part was way too diffiicult to achieve so my plate was a soggy, overly sauced salty dish. I was introduced to Genghis Grill by a buddy of mine who understood my dilemma so when he took me here, I was a bit relieved to hear they had pre-made sauces. Overall, the meat is fresh (not served frozen) and the vegetable section is quite good. I was disappointed with two things here 1: Bowls are very small. Since only one trip to the bar is allowed, for those who have quite an appetite will have to do a lot of topping as much as possible    2: Price is not cheap.   3: Service is somewhat lacking considering that this is a wait-staffed eatery.",

I went with my husband and our 5 year old daughter before we went to see a movie, at first i was pleased, the hostess handed us a tiny bowl for our daughter and seated us right away.  from there it was horrible.  She tossed a menu down on the table and walked away, and me being used to Mongolian like at YC's this was way different.  I had to stop another employee to ask what we were supposed to do. he waved us over to the line where the food was and walked off.  I walked up and saw all the choices for meat, it didn't look like they kept it cold enough so i steered clear of any seafood and anything not marinated.  The vegetables mostly looked canned except for the mushrooms and the carrots.  The guys at the grill weren't happy to be there and they made no point of hiding that fact, they just pointed at our choices (rice, brown rice, udon noodles, or SERIOUSLY spiral macaroni) and grunted something, he handed us three cards and sent us off, by the time we got back to our table they had seated someone else at our table.  I was so upset I almost walked out at this point, but we didn't have time for anything else before the movie.  I would definitely NOT recommend this to ANYONE, all the food tasted horrible, go to YC's instead.",

I was a little weirded out by the theme and the faux bronze bust of Genghis Khan at the grill. Er. What's next, Stalin's Salon? or maybe Hitler's Hummus Hut?   My only other Mongolian grill experience is with YC's, so I was impressed to see they had an extensive selection real, fresh protein (very, -very cold- fresh meats, reassuringly...even sausage and scallops), spices, veggies, egg!, sauces (all sugar-based... ehhhh), and starches.   They even have a little guide system showing you which items to pick if you want a particular bowl (teriyaki, Cajun, whatever). I just filled mine with whatever looked good. After they grilled it all up they served it in a bizarre asymmetrical bowl that first looked like I'd just dump my food all over myself, but it actually proved to be quite conducive to... shoveling. And it was delicious.  The flat screen TVs are weird. Their placement is such that the employees can probably watch them just fine, but most of the people actually eating here can't. Very odd.   A single bowl is about $8, while all-you-can-eat is $12. I was full after half a bowl and took the rest  home (no charge for a to-go box like YC's, yay!)  Edited 5/26/08- Okay, service here is almost always terrible. I've only ever had one really attentive server, a really petite friendly woman who chatted with us and checked in often. Otherwise, service has always sucked. So bad that I've ended up fetching my own food (normally your server brings it to you) and my own water (!!). A couple times the food area was a total mess with food all over the floor and counters... which, I understand, is part of the problem of telling people \"here's your food, quickly pile it as high as you can!\" so maybe I was just there at exactly the wrong moment.",

Service has always been great and friendly, I think I have eaten there about 25 times in the last year and I have always been extremely happy. The drink specials are second to none. It really bothers me when people are complaining about the price, it is like 10 bucks, if you cant afford 10 bucks for a meal that you are going out for then maybe you should stay in. Also people that are mad about sizes, you do know you can go back up, they are all you can eat for like a couple more bucks, but if you make it right you should never have to go back up. This place is so so good, they are busy all the time, and it is a really fun place to check out. Everyone should go there!!!",

Then I take my battered little bucket (you feel like a Unicef kid for a minute) and head to the assembly area, and here is where Genghis Grill outshines their competition.  The quality of the meats, seafood and vegetable is clearly a cut above almost every other Mongolian Grill type establishment.  Since I don't eat meat I put some shrimp and scallops in the bowl, and assemble my favorite mix.  I do not recommend cramming too much meat into your bowl -- a juvenile mistake I see made by kids with bad skin and future cardiac issues.   Take it easy on the sauces since they are laden with sodium and oil.  You will be pleasantly surprised at the volume of food that your bowl + rice/noodle mix will create.   Friendly staff and a decent selection of beers.  As others have noted, it can take time to get your check and get out the door.  In noting some other reviews I think I think it would be helpful for Genghis Grill to really emphasize that overdoing the sauces will just destroy your meal.",

There was a pretty good sized meat selection, including marinated steak, which I chose. For seasoning, there were some pretty tempting choices, and I went with a couple shakes of black pepper, citrus garlic herb, and crushed red pepper. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and surprisingly potatoes went on next, followed by some mongo barbecue, Szechuan, and honey soy sauces, and noodles.  The carrots were maybe a little too thick and crunchy, not quite cooked through, but other than that, everything was all good.  The bowl was a little small (you don't put the noodles on yourself, so you don't need a huge bowl), but I think I managed to get a decent sized meal into it. I probably could have put a little more meat in there, but I'll remember that for next time.  Personally, I prefer the YC's experience, just because it's simpler, faster, and gives you a little more food for a little less money. But I don't have any complaints about this place.",

    "text": "Went there for the first time on a Friday night around 5 pm with my GF. I had been to YC's Mongolian Grill, which I really enjoyed but at YC's I felt like something was lacking. Don't get me wrong, YC's is good stuff, but sometimes I want to have something spicy or more savory and I feel that YC's sauces aren't very thick. I like Pei Wei because of their thick sauces, and yes, none of this food is 'authentic' Chinese food or whatever (I hate those sort of nuts). Enjoy the food for what it is.  The service was good. Nothing stellar, the server brings you water and brings you your food after you have created your delectable and dropped it off to the grill master. You are seated while your food is cooked, and this is a great thing because it takes maybe 5-10 minutes for your food to cook (if you wait it'll cause a huge fart in the line). We did the unlimited to try more stuff, and the server always took out plates and offered us another bowl if we needed. Food was always out promptly. I thought it was hilarious that the guy working on the grill hits the gong when there are a ton of bowls ready.  The buffet line was decent. I'm being a little picky here, but I think if you're going to do a buffet sort of thing, you better keep it stocked with fresh items. There were a few times I went to make a bowl and there was old chicken laying around with chicken juice just marinating the chicken. That's not very appealing. To their defense though, the other items remained stocked pretty well. The cubed beef looked very fresh and lean, not a lot of fat hanging around, just enough to taste good. Vegetables and stuff were stocked pretty well too, sauces area was kept clean and there was plenty of sauce when I went.  The cooking was mediocre. The first bowl I got was cooked well, except the noodles weren't as hot as the rest of the food, which found its way to the bottom. They managed to keep the sauces saucy and mixed it well into the food. I was turned off by the fact that the cooks were throwing tin and stuff into the corner and making a racket. Not professional at all. My GF complained that some of the food was overcooked, and while I somewhat agree, I have a higher range of acceptable cooking ranges. I'll eat rare all the way up to well done, my GF won't. I didn't get any rare, but I got some very well done, with some charring on my steak and chicken.  Great atmosphere, I could definitely go here and have a bowl while watching a game. Seems busy and the crowd is well-mannered, except for these idiot teenagers who were reaching over me in the buffet line. Don't mind them though, they're probably just idiots anyways.  Pricing is kind of an issue. Unlimited for $14 (after student discount) is something that might keep me from going back. I could potentially get just as much food from Pei Wei for less. Yes, its not going to be the same, but the two styles are very similar. If you like Pei Wei you will like this place. If you want Pei Wei, but buffet style sort of you should try this place out. You can get just a bowl for $10, but even that is a little too steep for a college student's pocket. I'd say unlimited + drinks for $12 and just a bowl with drinks for $8.50 is much more fair. I really don't even get drinks usually, but its nice to have it offered with the 'package'.   I'm really torn between giving this place a 3 or a 4. I like to reserve my 4s and 5s for places that I will go to whether I have a craving for it or not. I mean, if I'm hungry but I'm not sure where to go, I can count on a place that will always suffice and be cheap. The meat and toppings were very fresh, the fried rice and noodles option is great, but the pricing is a major issue. If the pricing goes down, I'd love to take my family there, and I'd love to rave about it. Until then, I think a 3 is sufficient.",

    "text": "In the United States, Mongolian is synonymous with putting uncooked food in a small bowl and handing it over to be cooked on a large metal grill by chefs with huge wooden sticks.  At Genghis Grill, you are directed to have a seat and your food is brought to you.  What separates Genghis from other Mongolian restaurants is that they use this extra time to fully cook the meet and vegetables.  No need for thin strips of meat, and the vegetables are not crunchy.  Cooking the food helps a lot.  I also like the wide variety of meets including marinated steak and sausage.  Yes, sausage.  Adding an egg is a good choice, and I usually favor the peanut sauce with some extra kick.  In the end, it is really your fault if your meal doesn't come out right, and you are allowed a few practice runs to perfect your choices.",

Yesterday 2 out of the 4 people at my table got the wrong starch, one had a very long delay because they'd somehow lost his bowl, another had totally raw egg in their bowl and we all had trouble getting drinks refilled. The prior visit my husbands bowl was served to the table next to us but the gentleman recognized that it wasn't his and sent it away. It was eventually served to my husband although they did offer to let him make a new bowl. Honestly, no one wants to start over when everyone else at the table has their meal. It seems like once they upgraded the decor everything else went downhill. Nothing is quite as clean and tidy as it used to be and the ingredients aren't as fresh. I also was bothered to see the busser wiping chairs and tables with the same towel but I see that at a lot of places...yuck!",

They will serve you water.  though the quantity is smaller than YC's Grill and the prices are higher, They don't charge 50 cents for to go boxes like YC's does.  Also, I enjoy the higher quality and greater variety of ingredients. ~*Its really hit or miss depending on what you create*~  My fav : crab meat + scallops + andoullie sausage + lil bit of ham cajun seasoning (2 spoons) + ginger seasoning  tofu, spinach, zucchini squash, lil bit of tomato, mushroom, lil bit of bean sprouts, lil bit of potato,  one big container of szechwan sauce, one small container of garlic chili oil  udon noodles,  and hand it over to the grill guy, and he hands you a number. You stick the number in the holder upper thing at your table.  Takes a big longer than YC's to cook.  but upside is you can go back to your seat and chill, the servers will bring your food to you in a fun looking bowl.  To go boxes are free, so if its too much, get it to go.  there are servers in this place, so expect to spend extra on tips too.",

It's best if you build your own bowl, but you can use their bowl suggestions.  I like eating the sliced and seasoned beef, the blended seasoning, a dash of cayenne and garlic.  For veggies, I use beansprouts, onions, bell peppers and snow peas. I like blending the sauces (teriyaki, mongo bbq and szechuan). Top off with some fried rice. Good stuff!",

You walk in get your bowl and immediately go over and start picking your food to be cooked.  I absolutely love the marinated steak and shrimp.  The chicken is great....Pork is OK.  Veggies are veggies so get what you want.  My wife and now I always get an Egg.....a fried egg really puts the stir fry together...seriously.  After you pick your food pick a sauce(I go with Teriyaki) and you then choose fried rice, Noodles, White rice or tortillas.  My advice get a mix and go with fried rice and noodles.  For you health nuts just go with the fried rice over the white rice...honestly this is probably the healthiest fried rice I have ever had.  My wife can always get a few tortillas for us as well because she asks the cook and they always say yes....What a charmer she is ;)  For good food a beer or two and the ability to watch a game if its on and great people watching this is a fun experience.  Service is usually great....last night ....meh  PS. Dont get the sundae....Its Ice Cream with a little bit of Chocolate sauce on it...just go down to Mojo for that.  Not worth it.  Q",

You stand in a line, fill up your bowl with your toppings -- including raw meat -- and let them cook it for you. When the check came, it was $75 for four people to eat and share an appetizer and a dessert. Plus we had to do some of the work! I'd go for a quick bite to eat for lunch or something, but probably wouldn't go back again if I was looking for a nice dinner with table service. It's a little too pricey for what you get.",

I drop to my knees outside and pray that once, just this one time, I'll get decent service. Nope. Kick in the nuts.   Thoughts: One, Maybe have more than one POS system for your servers. Could help.   Two, hey server guy, you got me a water. That's it. The whole meal. A single water. Not a refill, for the one water you brought me, which was empty for ten minutes. However, had you seen it empty it had taken you probably 5-10 minutes to refill it, this being based on how long it took you to fill up the Coke for the table next to us while you sat behind the bar and talked to the rest of the staff. Our food (once again always delicious, mix the 3G with the Thai peanut sauce, it's amazing. Recommended by another server, I think his name was Steve, that guy is probably awesome, I assume he drives like a cool truck and volunteers at some charitable organization) back to our food, you didn't bring us that, another server did.   So, in a matter of 30 minutes our server came by twice, once to bring me a water and the next to ask, Check? Well, my food is gone, my water cup as dry as the Sahara, and I've resorted now to downloading and playing some iPhone game about breaching a beach. I'm on level 100 because that's how long I've had since you last stopped by to check on me. Yeah....check.   I try hard to not be mean, but I served for a long time and I know it's not an easy job, but it's not that hard. Especially on a Friday lunch shift. And last, after you ask if I want my check could you not stop by the hostess stand to flirt and just bring me my check? I have to make it to a movie and if I miss the previews and most likely a new Melissa McCarthy movie trailer, so help me god.   So, after all this, will I stop coming. No, dammit no, because that sauce combo with udon noodles, shredded beef and sausage is just too damn amazing. And I always hold on to the small chance i may see Steve again and get a new recipe recommendation. Long live Steve.",

I chose chicken, salmon, scallops, a variety of vegetables,  a curry sauce, and rice noodles. The resulting dish was OK, a bit on the bland side; perhaps this is because I didn't take as much sauce as I should have. The staff is friendly and helpful, but the queue at the ingredients trays moves slowly.",

Prices are fair and the people were really kind & even gave us 20% off for the mix up. Good environment. Maybe I just picked out the wrong sauce/combination of food (chicken, shrimp, onion, egg, udon, and dragon sauce) and that's why I didn't really care for it. Maybe I was expecting a Chinese cuisine type of meal (yes, it's Mongolian food). Wouldn't recommend. Plenty of other places to visit in Tempe Marketplace. Again, *extremely* nice waitresses and managers, just not a fan of the food & selection.  Tip for if the business if they read this review: remove the glass panel at the food line. Horrible design to make customer reach under to grab a food item. Really awkward & uncomfortable.",

You pick your meats, veggies, side items, seasoning, etc. and hope that what you picked out will end up looking (and tasting) appetizing.   This restaurant is categorized as Mongolian, but I don't think what I created was Mongolian-like. lol. I really wished they had a separate menu on the side for those that are indecisive and would rather pick something truly Mongolian. :)  My tip is don't be afraid to had lots of meats and seasoning. I regret this because mine was light on the meat side, and it tasted super bland.   I would recommend this place if you're tired of ordering from a menu and would like to test the waters with new and inventive dishes.",

I usually sit at the bar and have always had friendly attentive service.   I've been to a similar place in California, but it was much larger and the grill was a main focus. Customers stood and watched as the chef made everything, which he did with a lot of flair and artistry.

She mentioned it to the waiter and he just said ok and brought the bill without even offering her something else or to remove her meal since she barely touched it. She asked for her meal to be taken off the bill, but the waiter said all the manager was willing to do is take 50% off.

Those aren't big problems, but it's little annoyances.  This makes me less likely to go out of my way to come here.  There is YC's and others, and they are closer to my home (and my office, for that matter).  If Genghis isn't going to set itself apart it removes incentive to visit.

    "text": "I would definitely like to come back here again! Last week, I tried Genghis Grill for the first time, not knowing what to expect. The whole \"build your own bowl\" concept was actually really cool!   Luckily, my bf and I went for a late lunch so the place was relatively empty (as an indecisive person, I'd probably feel overwhelmed with the amount of options to choose from if there had been a line of people behind me). Lots of meats, vegetables, spices, and sauces offered! They even had 5 or 6 bases to choose from (brown rice, egg noodles, etc).   Despite not knowing what I was doing...I mean, there was no plan or coordination as to what would go well with anything. I was just throwing everything that looked good into the bowl. (Kind of like how I make my FroYo)...mine came out soo well! I think it was about $25 for our 2 medium bowls, which were both very filling and delicious.   An interesting place for lunch, despite its Tempe Marketplace food court-esque location.",

You're seated at your table, get an ordering card (size of a box card), go pick up a recipe card, tell the server what size bowl you want, then pile up your bowl with your ingredients and sauces based on your selected recipe, and then at the end of the cafeteria style line, hand it over to the cook who grills it on a huge grill.  Food was good and portion sizes were abundant but it was too complicated between the various servers and cooks and knowing what to put in your bowl...",

    "text": "This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.    First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.  Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.    Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that \"Kung Pao\" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.    I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.  Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.     YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.  You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again.",

I knew by the name that it was going to be mongolian bbq, which I had decided I didn't like based on my ONE experience with YC's. I decided to suck it up and deal with it because I knew he would like it.   I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised. Not only was the selection of foods better and fresher than YC's, but I really liked the atmosphere much better. We are now regulars here even though it is not close to us at all.  I highly encourage using some of their recommendations the first couple of times so you don't end up crying because you made it too spicy (don't ask me how I know)! Another fun one to try is the fajita combination. You can actually request tortillas, sour cream and cheese and make mini \"fajitas\" out of them. Do keep in mind that this is fast food. The cheese and sour cream are very fast-food-like, but you can really make the meat and veggies worthwhile if you experiment a bit.  Overall, my whole family loves this place. It's nice to be able to make our own creations without the \"asian buffet\" style foods saturated in goopy sauces.",

She had forgotten to get our drinks for quite a while. We had to flag her down. It's okay though, she was hungover.   Then a guy walked around the entire restaurant three times with my bowl of food, walking past me each time, with my number in plain sight. I even stopped him, saying I thought he had mine. \"No,\" he said, as he continued to search for a unicorn with a magic number somewhere past the rainbow. Finally he discovered me and delivered my food about 5 minutes after my friend got his.  I might go here again, because the food was good, and the available options are plentiful. Note to first timers: don't follow the recommended recipes on the cards/wall. Just throw in whatever looks good. And watch out for blondes who appear to be hungover.",

I'm glad I don't live closer to one of Genghi's Valley locations because I'd end up eating there more often that I'd like to admit.

I thought maybe it was because she may have been hormonal (she was in her 3rd trimester), but she smiled at other tables and as soon as she came to mine, I kept getting the same nasty look. She stopped at every table but only zipped past mine. It couldn't have been because the hostess sat me at a further table. She sat me there herself. She asked me if everything was good and before I could even say anything she was already off somewhere else. It was as if she was pretending to serve me. The guy who brought me my bowl asked if I wanted Sriracha or soy sauce and I asked if I could have both. He walks off and passes by my table. I wait again for him to pass and nothing. He passes by a third time and goes to the hostess area and gets on his Facebook. The table they sat me at was wet when I sat down. I had to use the one napkin they gave me to wipe it off. I don't know what was wrong. It was as if they were in a hurry. There was no rush. It was about three in afternoon and there were only two other tables. The amount of staff outnumbered the amount of guests. The bowl they gave me had some dried food on it. I had to ask for another one. When it came time to pay the bill was a little under 20 dollars so I left a 20 and just walked out. Smallest tip I have ever left in my life. I pay 15% even for mediocre service, but this level of WTF, idk, they should have paid me to endure that.",

I thought I seasoned it up pretty well, but I very much enjoyed the Dragon spice and sauces. After a few minutes, our meals were brought over and I thought my bowl was amazing.

    "text": "We were excited to come to this Mongolian grill suggested by family.  First of all, we visited on a Friday night. This location is in the Tempe Marketplace, an outdoor mall. Parking was horrible, and that is not the fault of the restaurant.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, and the hostess quickly seated our group. Something had apparently spilled on the floor near the bar long before we arrived and we all walked through it. The service and customers had spread whatever was spilled in a sticky mess all throughout the restaurant. Gross.  To top that, the first table we sat at was also sticky, and before the waitress came back, we had found ourselves a new table.  There is quite a selection of meats and veggies, this was a plus. However, the selection of sauces, while extensive, is completely (almost?) sugar-based. It would be nice to have had some options that were lower calorie or lower glycemic index. Even just oil and soy sauce would have been nice.  The service came around often, however she never checked to see what everyone needed before darted off to get one person's drink., which resulted in her needing to make many more trips.  Overall the food was really just so-so, and the fresh meat that others describe was actually frozen when we made our bowls.",

The fresh diversity of meats, chicken and fish; are outstanding! The veggies are very fresh as well. I recommend that you try the sauces first with the little spoons. Here you are master of your own pallet. You can ask them to use less or no oil to make the meal a little healthier. Choose wisely because the portions are as generous as you want to make of them! The owner is awesome and the cast and crew are ubber friendly. There happy hour specials are excellent if your a well drinker. I recommend making yourself a spicy Mongo beef. Use the N.Y strip instead of the sliced beef and you will know where I am coming from!",

This was my second time dining here and I left with sticky shoes from the filth on the floor. It looked like a disaster struck the ingredients area with a large amount of food on the ground and counter. All of the raw proteins were mixed together from people assembling their bowls. Plus, this time around they managed to mix up the starches my boyfriend and I ordered. He got my udon noodles and I ended up with his rice. They offered to fix it by scraping our toppings onto the correct starches. Not sure how that was supposed to work considering the noodles were mixed in. Don't think I'll be back to give them a third try.",

    "text": "Technically 4.5   I'm gonna go ahead and agree with most people on here that this place has YC's beat hands down in the food department.  Better quality, better choices and the fact that they put the sauce on after the fact all contribute. (Plus really good brown rice)  Also, no stupid take-out charge or whatever.  I've noticed that if you sit in the bar area, the service is incredibly awesome, but if you're in the regular dining area, it's a little lax.  I've only once not sat in the bar area so it's never been a problem, but worth mentioning. (if you're a party of 3 or more, most likely you'll have to sit in the regular dining area FYI)  The kicker is the amazing drink specials.  Last time is was there, it was $1 Wells, $2 3 Olive Vodka drinks, $3 Drafts and $4 Sake Bombs.  The cocktails are mixed good and strong and the sake bombs use pretty good sake and your choice of Kirin or Sapporo.  They obviously don't market these deals very efficiently because this place would always be packed with ASU'ers looking for a cheap buzz every day of the week.  Overall, I really like this place.  Two things they can change/improve on for me to give a perfect rating. 1. They don't seem to clean up the buffet fast enough, which means that sometimes you'll find some pepperoni in the beef, or carrot in the broccoli, or worse yet, some cilantro in the jalapenos (I HATE cilantro!) Plus the sauce area is always sticky. 2. I think that the price of the food should be $1-2 cheaper.  Yes the drink specials even it out and then some, but if you're not taking advantage of those, it's a little pricey, especially since location-wise, they're catering to a lot of college students.",

    "text": "So I had never been to a place like this, although I have seen them in other malls. Here, you are seated and then your server explains to you how it works (and very, VERY quickly, I might add... I know the concept is simple but I needed to know why the menu didn't exactly describe the food... and since I've written this review AFTER I've eaten here, I still don't know why the damn menu can't help out with explanations of some of the sauces and spices).   You are handed a small silver bowl (kinda like a doggy dish... huh.) You walk your lazy ass over to the line and load up on your choice of however much you want of raw chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, scallops, \"krab\" and whatever else is on this chilled salad bar. Playing upchuck-roulette isn't one of my favorite ways to spend an evening but hey, I'll try anything once.  From here you move on to a stack of different spices (which range from mild to ass-ripping) and while they are labeled, if you don't know what something is to begin with, then you just don't know. I picked three (one was garlic powder and the other two I couldn't tell you) and sprinkled my shrimp/chicken/beef. On to the vegetables! Here we have what amounts to a salad bar with a few Asian twists. I sometimes think of myself in the same way when I'm gettin' down, and that's only when my ego is in full force. But I digress. You load up veggies into your bowl, such as broccoli, spinach, baby corn, water chestnuts, mushrooms... and I threw in a few of those kung pao hot peppers, just for fun. Then you move down the line to the sauces! Here's where it gets stupid: There are about 20 different sauces. There are even tasting spoons if you don't know what something is. But my problem with this is that I'm not going to stand here and taste a bunch of stuff and hold up the line (although I am sure plenty of nimrods do). So I just closed my eyes and picked three, just like with the spices. Small scoops into a little dipping container and then you move down to the cook, who will fire up your food with noodles or rice and then have it brought directly to your table.  I can't tell you what I picked as far as sauces and seasonings go, but the food was cooked perfectly. Beef wasn't chewy and there was a nice sear on the sides of all of the meats. At first, I was disappointed because I couldnt taste any of my flavorings. But then a few minutes went by and I got that steamy, face-reddening, eye-watering aftertaste heat that only Asian food can produce. Great success! And I didn't get salmonella, either! (this time.) Oh... AAAND.... **$1 happy hour well drinks with a decent-to-heavy pour.**",

Well unfortunately,  IT WAS AWFUL...The counter where you make your meal was disgustingly dirty, my rice was watery and when I got my meal it looked like a bowl of mush....something you would feed a bunch of chickens. I had chosen a ton of veggies and fish,  well they destroyed it during the cooking process.  It looked awful and it tasted worse. I also spent the later part of my evening in the bathroom!  (not just me, hubby too) Never again will I eat at Genghis Grill...I actually thought about calling my bank and disputing the charge. This place is nothing short a high end really bad Chinese food restaurant, you know the  ind where you are eating and you know you will regret it later!!!!    YUCK YUCK YUCK...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!",
