If you've not tried them, try the wings! Different than your ordinary wing and oh so yummy m! Bun Duc Biet was also delicious! Pork and shrimp were cooked beautifully and they even let me have my sprouts in it.   I look forward to my next trip. Will be hankering for the wings sooner than later.",

My #1 selection is the B4 with no pork and extra shrimp and no barbecue sweet sauce on the shrimp. It's famously known as BUN.  IT's Barrack Obama's and my favorite dish.  The young owners bring a refreshing zeal to the decorum.  A HIDDEN TREASURE. Be sure not to miss the hand made murals direct from Vietnam!  !!!!!",

Let me start off by describing the interior. Super clean, modern and welcoming. We had the pleasure of having the place all to ourselves.  We were greeted by Khoa. He was so incredibly friendly and helpful when ordering. My boyfriend ordered Pho filet and I ordered a chicken noodle dish. They were both DELICIOUS. The Pho was our favorite as the flavors were just sooooo good!!! A must try if you ask me.   This restaurant recently opened and we are telling everyone we know to check it out. You will not be disappointed.   Thank you Khoa! You will see us often.",

The broth is what usually makes the pho stand out and I was disappointed that it did not taste like Christmas in my mouth. I will continue to keep going to my favorite pho place inside the Mekong market. Sorry Saigon, you did not make the roster.",

Since the recent management change Renovations and the FANTASTIC update on the menu!! it has turned into my favorite place to come I no longer have to say don't worry about what it looks like the food is awesome now the restaurant matches the food... You guys have to try the summer rolls it's a twist on the spring rolls has a bit of a crunch to it! And oh my God the sauce that comes with it is Amazing! To all my Orange County folks if you guys know brodards Saigon Bowls summer rolls are better!! Another thing I'd like to add is it still has that genuine mom-and-pop feel to it !!",

I got recommended by a friend and since then I come here almost every week for lunch, trying different things every time and NEVER feel disappointed. The restaurant is pretty with modern decoration and clean. Excellent customer service for a good price of food. The staff are very attentive and nice to talk to. Their Pho is the best, authentic and flavorful. You can tell that they use fresh ingredients. Also, they have the best grilled pork sausages (nem nuong) spring rolls in town that I've never found in other Vietnamese restaurants. It comes with a very special delicious peanut sauce. Very tasty!!! Overall, If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would!!! They are deserved it.",

The noodle and meat to broth ratio was kinda scantly with more broth than sustenance but the flavor and freshness made up for this. I got the combination pho without tendons or tripe  and swapped it out with meatballs instead. Thumbs up.",

Even for call in orders, there is an exorbitant wait time. For pho, this is ridiculous. Normal pho broth is simmering all day, no? Well, the first thing that weirded me out was the fact that they asked if I wanted chicken or beef broth. Um....neither! I want the fermented fish broth that is the staple of pho! Blasphemers! I was not happy with the noodle quality either. They were clearly dry noodles of a lesser quality.  The counter service is curt and unfriendly. As I watched each patron come in or order, it was clear to me that customer service is not the strong suit here. I think they may have been annoyed with people in general...Asian or not. I also am suspicious of Vietnamese restaurants that try to supplement their menu with crappy Chinese-American food. If you do something well, you wouldn't have to cater to the apartments around you for cheap Chinese take-out.",

Back then, the food add ons (to the soup, which are served on a separate plate) were more generous: a pile of bean sprouts, cilantro, lime, jalapenos and fresh mint. Recently, the add ons have diminished to a small amount of bean sprouts, very little cilantro, 1/2 lime, 4 slices of jalapeno and _no_ mint whatsoever, which is kind of disappointing, and its flavor is sorely missed in the soup. The soup itself is still very good; however, the server gave me a different soup than what I had ordered. The vermicelli dish with shrimp, beef, little egg rolls with sauce was delicious; their espresso is very good, hot or cold (I like the hot as it has no added sugar and it is a very strong, but not acidic flavor). The new decor is very contemporary, nice ambience and everything seems very clean.",

We put in an order of chicken dumplings, and they came out in just a few minutes! We ordered two bowls of pho--chicken and beef. Both were delicious, and both came out lightening fast as well!

I am updating my rating to reflect good customer service.  Perhaps my next try I can update it even higher and understand why others love it so much  Previous review:   Surprised by the awesome reviews.  That's the reason we ordered - we won't order again.    First, the wrong food was delivered.  However we were on limited time and didn't want to complain and wait for replacements.  So we tried to eat it.  The wings were SO hot that it was difficult to eat them, spicy not temperature.  But when we wiped off the peppers, they were more doable - if only they didn't smell like fish bellies, they might have been ok.     The beef chow mein however stinks so bad no one would touch it.  I mean wow.  Bad.    The sweet and sour chicken we asked for the sauce on the side.  Instead it showed up with tiny cubes of breaded chicken soggy and swimming in not good sweet and sour sauce.  Barely edible - tasted like it came from a can.    We ordered two orders of fried rice.  I can't speak to that because it wasn't delivered.    We ordered those rice paper summer rolls with peanut sauce stuff - again, not delivered.    We did have some kind of fried rolls that showed up and they were edible.  But they weren't enough to fill us up since nothing else was touched due to smells and texture.",

For my drink I had the Thai Tea and Cafe Su Da (Vietnamese iced coffee).  On top of having a delicious meal, I have to say the staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean.

If I were to have any complaints, I'd say the noodles are too soft. I couldn't pick them up with chopsticks without them breaking into really small pieces so I suggest adding in the noodles a bit later to allow customers to pick up the noodles.

Not only is the food really good and the place is never super busy, so u can get in and out without running into everybody but the staff care about their business. I was minding my business eating my pho and a loud customer placed a to go order. She asked the staff to place the items a certain way because once something was off balanced and came out (prob the customers fault) I say this because she seemed obnoxious. However, I think it was the owner who was helping the customer and after the customer left u could hear the woman telling the kitchen to really focus on packaging to go orders. She even said to the other employee \"Do you understand, because this is how we learn and do better\" :) I think I just really appreciated a business taking ownership and caring about customer service even when the customer is not around.",

Or maybe it's just the wet cilantro squeaking around in it...  I just happened to be in the neighborhood and had a craving for something light and fresh.  Now, had it been a few years back, I probably would have given the extra half a star.  However, a few things have changed with that little spring roll.  There's a lot of lettuce in it now, which is strange.  More lettuce seems a little skimpy to me.  I wished there would have been more carrot and pickled jicama in it, but there were only a couple of pieces here and there.  No bean sprouts, and very little rice noodle.  The lettuce  washed out some of the shrimp flavor.   Still, it was pretty tasty and the peanut sauce was really part of my craving, and that definitely hasn't changed - sweet and just a little spicy.  The Thai Tea was amazing and as refreshing as the spring roll.  Thai Tea is my old new best friend.  The little lady behind the counter is very nice and threw in a few almond cookies for us.  So my rating is lacking experience in most of the menu, but the spring rolls are still some of the best I've had in town.  Still can't beat my momma's rolls with my daddy's fish sauce!",

Service was good up to the point of our waitress getting off for the day.  After that we did not get any service except for the bill. Still looking for a great Pho restaurant.",

Food was still delicious, and even some of the presentation of dishes was pretty instead of just practical. I got the bun with shrimp and pork. I've grown since my first review. So good. No diakon or chili flakes in the fish sauce but still good. Good ratio of meat and noodle and yummy veg. The BF got the pho filet which was good too. He didn't even finish. We shared the spring rolls and imperial rolls. Very good stuff. The place was empty mostly so some parts of the service could've been better, like asking for more water and later asking for a box. Not a deal breaker though. The two guys there were super nice and the food was delicious. Now open until 9. Woo hoo!",

    "text": "You have to come here for the pho. Hands down!  My boyfriend lives right down the street, so whenever we're hungover, feeling sick, or need our pho fix, we always come here. Sure, we've been to the Noodles Ranch up the way, but we love going to the Saigon Bowl, it's so 'Mom&Pop.'  There's almost always no one else there and it looks super out dated. But we don't mind. We understand that Noodles Ranch is pricier than here mainly due to the atmosphere. But it's absolutely perfect if you just want to come in, sit down, guzzle down your pho and drench the meats in sauces and leave on a happy, full stomach while knowing you paid less than $9 bucks.  The portions are large, the veggie plate served with herbs, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and limes is pretty standard and of good quality and size.  The timing was just fine (although I've ordered one of their chicken entrees before and waited just a few more minutes longer than ordering the pho) and well worth the satisfaction to follow.  I've ordered just about every type of bowl of pho and have never been unhappy. Broth alone isn't anything too strong. It's light enough to have you finish the whole bowl. The meats are perfectly portioned for dipping in the sauces that are at each table and of course, the ending gulps are the most flavorful.  I'll always be coming to this place so long as it's in business.",

Unfortunately, we were not prepared for what we encountered. It took about forty five minutes for us to receive our food in this empty restaurant, but I hoped the food would be worth it. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and the chicken was smothered in sauce - being hardly edible. The grilled lemon chicken that two other family members ordered needed to be returned due to it being cold. The grilled pork was satisyingly warm in temperature, but nothing special. The server never officially took our drink order, and never came back to refill our water. This was definitely not a very pleasant experience.",

Ownership changes must be True because the menu looks cleaned up even compared to pictures from this August.  The Vietnamese coffee was pretty on point - always better with condensed milk! The nem nuong was solid as well - good crunch and savoriness from the wontons and meat, and the sauce hit the right notes. Too bad about the fried rice though - the toppings are on point but it was pretty bland. I did end up trying some of my brother's pho broth, but It felt decent/average, not really wowed by it.  Single digit Viet food, even if mediocre, should have been a home run for me, but I was really bugged by the service, at times pushy and inconsistent. Weird, right? A lot of people here are heralding it.  If I order Vietnamese coffee in Vietnamese, I hoped that would imply I know what I'm doing. Literally the second my drip stopped, a waiter swooped in and asked me if I knew what I was doing. Before I could even respond, he took my cup and did pouring/stirring for me. Seriously, dude? That's part of the experience.  Also my friend ordered a separate coffee without condensed milk at the same time. We were engaged in conversation, but 40 minutes later it didn't come - turns out my separate order turned out to be a correction of his...? It took one of our late friends ordering a third coffee before they realized what happened.  I think given location and pricing this place is okay - maybe I'm just an off experience with service. When we were the only ones in the restaurant. I probably won't be back though - I literally had better AZ Viet food in a food court.",

Ordered the combination pho, but it was only one size. Also ordered taro smoothie with boba.   Pho was small size for what I've seen from Texas. I always like to try the soup on its own before putting all the garnish and sauce. This tasted fresh, but was weak in terms of flavor as it's a bit water down?  The content and noodles were fine, but the soup just didn't have the aroma and flavor that distinguishes itself from other noodle soup.   Boba came with those typical lid and not the sealed type that you can shake it upside down. So that's 1 Star less already. Once again, the drink was ok, perhaps a bit too much ice blend. But the boba lack any texture as it's definitely not freshly cooked. You know it's freshly cooked when you can still feel the heat on the bottom of the cup, and this was not.   Overall, quite disappointed given such high reviews.",

    "text": "Yelp hits the nail on the coffin with how I feel about Saigon Bowl: Meh.  Great prices, but sub-par on everything else.  There are definitely a few red flags right off the bat with this restaurant.  1) The smaller menu.  Most Vietnamese places have a ton of menu items, with every pho, rice noodle bowl, and rice permutations you could ever imagine. But this menu was tiny.  2) \"Pho with Filet Mignon\" was a legitimate item on the menu and one of only about 6 Pho menu items.  Sounds enticing to the masses, but I've never had a \"Filet Pho.\"  Most authentic Vietnamese restaurants I've been to don't even know what filet mignon is.    Okay, I agree my \"red flags\" are much more superstitiously leading than I give them credit for.  But still.  They may not have a causal relationship with the quality of the food, but they're highly, highly correlated.  I ended up ordering a Vietnamese coffee over ice and a Pho with beef brisket (too much of a gamble for the filet...gotta go with a staple, y'know?).  My Pho turned out OK.  The broth was pretty good, but they skimped HARD...and I mean, HARD...on the brisket.  We're talking roughly 5 pieces of beef in an otherwise large bowl of noodle soup.  I guess it goes to show you get what you pay for with the sub-$8 price tag, but damn.  I would've taken a smaller bowl for $12 if it meant I got a few more pieces of beef!   The Vietnamese coffee actually tasted great and is probably one of the better coffees I've had in a very long time.  It may be the one saving grace of an otherwise sub-par restaurant.  They've clearly perfected the condensed milk + drip coffee mechanics, and the waiter will actually come back around when it's ready to stir and pour the coffee over ice for ya!    Side note on the Vietnamese coffee: I arrived late and two of my friends already at the table had both ordered the coffee.  One of my friends got his and was nearly finished with it, the other hadn't gotten his yet.  I got to the restaurant and sat down for a good 5 minutes before ordering, and 5 minutes later, they brought out my coffee...before they brought out the one for my other friend...who had ordered like 40 minutes earlier.  What??  It took another 10 minutes before they \"realized\" they forgot to bring out the second Vietnamese coffee.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and not pull the race card here, but given my coffee-less friend was the only white person at the table, the race jokes and/or connotations are inevitable.  TL;DR: Saigon Bowl's negatives far outweigh the positives, and the service seems to be a bit of a mixed bag.  Tread cautiously, folks.",

Unique flavors of spring rolls that I haven't had at other Vietnamese restaurants. Definitely one of my favorite Pho places in town.",

There is something so homey about the soup. I don't know how they make it but I know that I have recently eaten most of my meals here.  The wait is at times a little long but I imagine it's because they do it right and magically.  My bean sprouts, herbs, and lime are always very quite crisp add ins and I haven't had any complaints. The chicken fried rice is also on point, in my opinion.",

Their prices are cheaper than any pho place I've found in Phoenix yet, and they give you more meat/noodles as well, and the broth isn't too oily. Spring rolls are great (around here places can have subpar rolls, even though it's an easy fix), and their banh mi are delicious, meat's made fresh daily by an auntie in house. Iced coffee is great too. Literally can't complain about anything, I'm so glad I found them!",

    "text": "I have to be honest, I'm a bit surprised that this place has this high of a rating on Yelp. The rating was enough to convince me to head to Saigon Bowl for some pho but I was a bit disappointed with my experience.   First, the interior is small but very cute. It was more trendy than other places I've been and even had little plants on each table. We were happy to see that there were only a handful of people here on a Saturday night and we got seated right away. I'm pretty consistent with my pho order so I was ready right away and my mom was able to make her selection in just a few minutes as well. After our waitress took our drink order and came back with them, my mom mentioned to her that we were ready to order. To that, the waitress walked away without a word and helped someone else. It took a few minutes of waiting and then flagging down our waitress again before we could place our order.   When our pho finally arrived, it was just okay. The noodles came as one big clump that was difficult to separate. I felt silly having to use my chopsticks as tiny swords to pull apart the clump of noodles before I could dig in. While we ate, the waitress never stopped by again. I went my entire meal without a water refill and she only came by to ask if we wanted more water after we had paid our bill.   The food was just okay but not enough to outweigh the lackluster service here. I probably won't be back. :(",

Once that was out of the way, he then said that this is where his family went for good noodles at least three times a month.  He's right- SB doesn't have much of an atmosphere, and it soon became clear that the majority of their business was in takeout sales (many were college students or middle-aged males).  So busy in fact, that my simple order of crab puffs and combo (beef and pork) noodles took longer than I'd expected (20-25 minutes).    The crab puffs were actually decent-- I would've preferred a toastier look.  However, they were nicely crisped, and not too greasy.  That is, after I'd toss them over a few hundred paper towels.  The noodles were tasty, and I preferred the saltier pork over the sweet beef.  (If only the noodle dish I ordered at China Magic the next day was as tasty as this one was!)  Be sure to have someone with you to share, bec. this entree won't taste as good the next day-- the noodles dried up overnight in the fridge.",

I checked the pictures, and it's the same place. Although, it has different chairs now.   The parking lot was full when we arrived, so we were hesitant, thinking the place would be packed. But, it was actually nearly empty. It had some nice music playing which made our date night even more enjoyable.  The servers were kind and on top of it. They took pride in their work, and our glasses never were less than half full. They made sure we were happy. It was awesome!   The food was amazing too. We tried two appetizers, the potstickers and the traditional spring rolls. The spring rolls were to die for. They had fresh herbs and the boyfriend (who hates shrimp) ate them happily. There was no fishy/shrimpy taste at all. We dipped them in the provided peanut sauce after mixing it with the chillis like the server suggested. The potstickers were fried fresh and the dough had a great texture. The sauce was a perfect spicy/sweet.   For our entrees we did the pho ga and the kung pao chicken. The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and i was hesitant to add any of the normal items to the soup. But, i slowly worked them in. The kung pao chicken was very fresh. They had a spicy and regular version. We liked it spicy and were glad they offered it.   I honestly can't get over how good it was. We will definitely be back.",

I was a regular customer of the previous owners for years, but have not been back in a couple of years.  The new owners changed the menu, and the decor.  Everything looked so clean and the place sparkled.  The food was fabulous with fresh vegetables and I'm so glad we chose to eat here.  The portions were huge (I didn't think I could finish it, but of course I did because it was so delicious)!  I had the Vietnamese bowl of noodles with egg roll.  On the menu it's listed as B2 - Vietnamese Imperial rolls, and my hubby had B4, which is grilled shrimp, Imperial rolls and pork, along with the noodles.  Both of us said how terrific these dishes were.  If you're in the neighborhood (or even if you're not, like us), I would definitely try them out.  I think you'll be very pleased you did.",

The Pho noodle soup was overall just okay, broth could have been more flavorful even after adding some sauces to the soup which didn't help too much unfortunately. I also tried the Lemongrass Chicken rice plate on another visit which was decent but nothing out of the ordinary. The portions for that were pretty good and I wouldn't mind trying another rice dish at this restaurant.  I could tell that the owners are really caring people with how they handle their food and service. It might be better to order takeout at this restaurant since the interior is nothing much to look at. I'd come back here to try some of their other dishes but may pass up on their noodle soup next time.",

The problem isn't the food though. The place is almost divey but I'm used to that.  The problem is that the food takes sooooo long to be served. Even if you order over the phone, they will tell you it should be 20-30 minutes. 20-30 minutes for a bowl of pho and a couple spring rolls at a non rush hour time? When you go to pick it up, you wait another 10-15 minutes. This has happened every time I ordered.  For Vietnamese food, and I've eaten at over 50 Vietnamese spots, this place is VERY slow. Especially for the quality.  I would only recommend if time and quality aren't an issue for you",

Yes they may seem unfriendly but that is because they are first generation to come to the States so English is there second language. But all you need is to give them a smile and they will give one back. Love love all the dishes ! And is a healthy choice. The prices have gone up but because the economy drop really affected this mom and pop restaurant. Give it a try you won't regret it!!! Xoxo sweet owners love them!!",

    "text": "I love this place!  Seriously, I grew up with a best friend whose Mom is Vietnamese(,came to the states with her American husband) and the little old lady who owns/runs this place reminds me of her.  Growing up I was always given advice like, \"you drink lots of milk and you wont be fat.\"  She always had food cooking, and the smells of her house were so unique.  My favorite thing about Vietnamese mothers is that they dote on their children while complaining.  I was always spending the night at her house, and when I would wake up, my clothes from the night before would be washed, starched, ironed (including my undies,) and everything would be folded in individual ziplock baggies.  Meanwhile we would get yelled at that she was always having to work hard to take care of us, and lord help her husband if he made her mad.  I swear Vietnamese mothers are awesome!  Any who, this lady is just as cool.  My first visit here was with a friend who lives down the street and recommended it.  We ordered it to go and were told it would take about 20 minutes.  So, we went and had a beer (or 3) at the dive bar in the same shopping complex and we went back minutes before the closing time.  As we walked it, it felt like a blast from the past.  The little old lady was complaining \"you order too much soup!  I had to make more soup because you order too much soup!\"  \"Oh, I so tired!\" \"I make SO much soup today!\" I knew right there that I was going to love this place.   The Chicken Pho comes in separate containers to keep the herbs fresh.  The chicken is separate from the broth and you get to mix it all together according to your like.  I usually can not eat all of it in 1 sitting.  The Goi Cuon, pork and shrimp salad rolls are delicious (I order an extra peanut sauce to dip.)  The fried spring rolls are good too (although the sauce that comes with them I don't like,) and I have had the fried rice and it is delicious and moist.  The crab puffs aren't very good, I wont ever order those again, but everything else I have ventured to try has been delicious.  Pho ranges in price from around $6.50-7.50, most Chinese meal combos are $8.50, and I think the salad rolls are around $6.   The little old lady doesn't always complain at her customers, and when she does she isn't mean.  One time I went in, and she was complaining about her new waitress.  Telling me how hard it is to train \"new help.\"  She will get over it fast and she will give you a genuine smile as you leave.  This is a locally owned Mom and Pop restaurant in a strip mall.  No frills, but they have been here for a while and seem to genuinely appreciate your business, even if they do complain a little.  We really did order too much soup.  Ate it for every meal for 2 days.",

The sausage spring rolls come with a special peanut sauce which was delicious, and the shrimp spring rolls were very tasty and came with the usual peanut sauce. They were very fresh, with crisp vegetables, and thai basil. I also ordered the spicy lemongrass chicken (medium spicy).  It was delicious, and I mixed the sauce into the jasmine rice, to get every flavorful bite. Apparently it is a favorite lunch restaurant for local tech workers. Oh, and the prices are righteous! The K1 sausage spring rolls were $4.25 and the K4 shrimp spring rolls were $3.95. (2 rolls per order, cut in half, total of 4 pieces).",

The egg rolls were delicious and was served with fresh lettuce and herbs. The pork sausage spring rolls were flavorful and fresh. Highly recommend.   The Cornish hen was incredibly moist. I believe it was fried first and then marinaded with perfect combination of herbs and spices. Absolute must have here.   The pho had nice broth and lots of perfectly cooked meats. The noodle started off little on the al dente side but softened up while eating.   The lemon grass chicken was delicious as well. Every dish was perfect portion size including the appetizers.   We also had few of their banh mi sandwiches Togo. It was delicious however, they were on the sweet side. We had grilled pork and pork sausage, but both were quite sweet for my liking. Beside the sweetness, it was tasty. Overall, very good meal. Would like to return to try more dishes.",

The clientele were mostly caucasians, not Asians (not a good sign). The flavors while good, didn't burst out, and the portions are smaller than I've encountered at similar Vietnamese places.  We had the pho, the bun, and one banh mi.  The pho was smallish, with an average beef stock, but very little meat  and supplemental veggies. The sandwich, while well-priced at under $5, was small and did not have the traditional pate' that authentic places use. The best dish was the bun (grilled pork with rice noodles and viet roll)......good size and flavor. Prices were good but you might leave hungry.  So in closing:  Hankering for Viet pho with noodles? That won't set you back too many rubles? To please your palate and tongue, I'd stick with the cold Bun, Cuz' their pho does NOT meet with my approval.",

Hubby got B4 Bun Dac Beit, Grilled shrimp, imperial rolls and your choice of beef or pork. He ordered the pork. Both meals came together. Very fragrant and tasty. Soft music plays in the background.

I'd never had any bun bowls before, and it sounded nice and light, so I got the bun dac biet. It was SO good. I generally am not the biggest fan of fish sauce, but the sweetened fish sauce was deeeeelicious. The bowl had lots of veggies in it (in addition to the shrimp, pork, and imperial roll advertised), and was nice and light. I thought there was just the right amount of sauce to give everything flavor without being too salty or drippy. Though pho still holds a special place in my heart, I've been getting bun at every Vietnamese place since I first had it at Saigon Bowl.  I was really craving Bun last night, and so my s/o and I came here. He's had Vietnamese food before, but has never really liked pho (I know I know, what kind of monster is he?!) BUT he was also in the mood for something new last night, and got the pho, and actually said he loved it! I'm hoping this is just the beginning of him becoming a full-fledged lover of Vietnamese food. Fingers crossed!!",

I haven't had much pho in phoenix so I can't really compare to other restaurants. I, for one, enjoyed it.   The atmosphere was clean and aesthetically pleasing.

A standard Asian dish that they didn't mess up. The soft wraps were a little expensive but still very good. For those that have a bigger appetite the shrimp and beef rice noodle bowl served plenty of food but tasted light enough that you wouldn't regret a big lunch or dinner.  Service isn't great or bad. A couple young kids have been around on my visits and they weren't overly attentive after providing the initial service.  It's a good spot with good food at a decent price.

Shopping plaza makes it feel like the place should be dingy but the minute you step it, it is clean and light. The family run operation couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Had the sausage spring roll and I am hooked. Ruined other rice paper rolls for me. Can't wait to go back and eat in the restaurant.",

Fresh-made bread? \"It's bound to be much better than Subway!\" said I.  How right I was ... the perfect sandwich! Wonderful, house-made bread. Very tasty beef grilled to perfection and all of it actually chewable. Fresh, fresh cilantro, cucumbers, carrot, and jalapeno. All of those ingredients balanced in just right quantities. Served by not one but two delightful people in an extremely clean and very comfortable place. I will be back!",

We have a couple standard orders that would be great to just be able to place the order from my favorites instead of having to call.   Restaurant is always sufficiently busy which is a good indicator that they are turning over their food. Spring rolls seem to be freshly rolled for each order.",

Pho is always a hit or miss, but even if it not that great pho still always taste good. The employees were very friendly and asked where we  live.

    "text": "This is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant that has managed to bring up the modern environment of other restaurants inspired by the simplistic Ikea design and welcoming atmosphere with smooth jazz or also a football game in the background if that's your thing, too. It can get pretty popping during lunchtimes, but so worth the potential noise some lunchtime groups bring with them. Oh, and dogs are allowed in the roofed/shades patio area. So that's the environment.  Food is top choice for me and I've had plenty of Vietnamese food from a Hispanic dude's viewpoint and I can definitely see all their pho, pork sausage ban me, or phe sua da (Viet iced sweet coffee) The owner, his family, and eager coworkers are honestly the second biggest reason I go besides the food I can never get enough of.   The main guy up front has become somewhat of my unspoken best pho friend along with some of the other servers. It's always great to find people other than business minded serving that treats you more of a number to quickly get in and out, especially when they are welcoming to a lot of different accommodations. It definitely feels like the close family members that invite you over for lunch a lot of the times I've been there and will continue to go as this has easily become my top pho place in the metropolitan area.   Keep it up, Saigon Bowl, you make me a very happy foodie.",

    "text": "Situated in a corner of a typical AZ strip mall I've passed this place hundreds if not thousands of times without a second thought.  Tonight I ran out if time and energy to make or go out for dinner so on the rare occasion when I order out (once or twice a year) I decided to try uber eats.  Have had good luck with uber for shuffling me around and a few harrowing scotter rides but when I saw the Saigon Bowl had high ratings a quick delivery estimate and lemongrass chicken it was an easy decision to place the order which was placed at  7:30, once I clicked to order the clock started with 8:10 as the targeted delivery time but shortly thereafter the expected delivery was updated to 7:55 and the excellently prepared and packaged food arrived at 7:55 +/- 60 seconds. Kudos to the Chef, the driver, and the uber for making this an easy relaxing evening with great food and service all around.",

    "text": "Years ago, I used to visit this spot for lunch because of my dealings with a nearby business. It was new, fresh, and delicious. The flavors and aroma of their dishes were off the chart.  This past week's visit gave us a different perspective. Although still an efficient place to dine, the allure of their culinary offerings were sub-par.  Surprisingly, this place was packed for a Saturday evening. We know not why. But, their efficient service was worth noting. Although they only had two gentlemen servers, they managed to stay abreast of everyone's orders. Everyone was kept pacified and satisfied, albeit, in a more informal manner.  They were out of my Beloved's favorite dish. Whenever we eat Vietnamese food, she usually wants to sample the place's beef stew. So, she decided to just get the fried rice as she's not a big pho fan. I was also not into pho that evening, so I ordered a chicken and shrimp dish. We'd also ordered egg rolls and calamari.   The egg rolls came, and they were decent, but seemed a bit overcooked. This turned out to be the theme of the meal. They forgot our calamari, but I imagine it would have been overcooked as well. The meats in the combo fried rice, while not burnt, was pretty hard and not well seasoned. The rice was also too crispy. My Chicken and shrimp dish was a bit less overcooked, but I found the dish to be bland and uninteresting.   I've noticed among the poor reviews, bland and uninteresting flavors seems to be a common complaint. Let's hope that the cooks at the restaurant make some changes to their recipes.",

The restaurant is cozy and nicely decorated with modern accents and service is friendly. I ordered bun nem thit huong (rice vermicelli noodles with grilled sausage and grilled beef), which turned out to be a good choice for a really hot summer day: cold rice noodles with tasty slices of grilled sausage and beef, a sprinkling of fresh cilantro and a side of the requisite nuac cham (rice vinegar dressing) - really good and well presented. I also had the sweet spicy wings, which had a good crunch and a bold but pleasing flavor. The strawberry boba smoothie was refreshing but would have been better if it were less sweet. In all, a satisfying meal at a good price in a pleasant, relaxing environment.",

I work off of 44th st and Van Buren and sadly there are no Pho spots super close to me so I decided to venture off today. Per usual this spot was in a tucked away parking lot but my goodness was it amazing inside! Right away you're greeted by one of the friendliest staffs ever!! The place was so clean, fresh, and had an overall great atmosphere with white and green tones you felt almost tropical but serene. My waiter was super friendly, accommodating and tentative! The place was really busy during lunch which to me is a great sign. I of course ordered the Pho Tai, which is the traditional steak pho and this time I ordered the egg rolls. The rolls came out first and were super hot and crunchy. I honestly didn't like how they had them already pre cut, it was a little too messy since the crust was cut and kept falling everywhere.  The pho came out shortly after and the steak was so soft and tender, some of the best steak I've had in pho. However, here is the bummer point for me, the broth was very bland. It had a darker color to it so I'm curious to know what ingredients they used to make it darker but lacked flavor. I ended up adding double the sauces than I use too and it then tasted almost right!  Overall, I wish this place was closer to work, I really enjoyed it! They even had a big patio for seating outside which I have never seen!! The service was wonderful, food was fresh and all in all great place!",

I had the hot jasmine tea and the SO had the iced tea. We ordered both the traditional spring rolls (with pork and shrimp) and the imperial rolls because we couldn't choose just one. They were both super tasty and VERY plentiful. I had the vermicelli bowl with pork sausage. Everything in that bowl was awesome and I love their fish sauce. The SO had the beef Bahn Mi, which of course I had a few bites of, and it was excellent as well. We left with full belly's and leftovers. To top it all off, the price is definitely right!  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for some quick, easy, and delicious Vietnamese food!",

It's changed hands a couple years ago for the better the menu is as good but the new owners are making an effort's on the decor, straight out of the IKEA store it's fresh and young. Great Pho great Bun and all the traditional Vietnamese side dishes and appetizers. There is nothing surprising on the menu but everything they have is good. I love to go there it's so affordable compared to other places in Scottsdale and the freshness of Vietnamese food is always welcome.",

I've been the only customer in the restaurant on more than one occasion.   I have been coming here for years for the pho and bun. The fresh spring rolls made with rice paper are delicious! The owners are always on site keeping an eye on things and running the kitchen.  I recommend ordering bun - a cold vermicelli noodle salad. Add your choice of meat and maybe a cut-up egg roll, and enjoy! Another favorite is the classic pho, a savory beef soup, featuring thinly sliced beef, noodles, bean spouts, jalapenos, mint, basil, and more.",

I came here from recommendation from my nail lady saying it was the best in Scottsdale so I had to know for sure. The location kinda sucks - in an old shopping center that you wouldn't think to look twice at. Everything on the menu is very reasonably priced! The servers are soo friendly and they always remember me.  Atmosphere is nice and clean, pretty modern and they have a small patio for when the weather is nice.  Thai Tea with bobba: This is like crack its so freaking delicious!!  Buddha Delight - Was a little disappointed in the flavor and the variety of veggies - nothing special.  I was hoping for more.  Shrimp Spring Rolls - these are tasty and fresh.  I am not a huge fan of peanut dipping sauce but I know thats traditional with rolls now a days.  House special pork rolls were delicious - they have this crunch to them and saltiness are perfect!  Filet Mignon Pho - I was expecting this to be the traditional slices of sirloin but it was more like a ground beef?  I thought it was a little strange but the flavor of everything was great! The broth was amazing!  Chicken Pho - this has been my favorite so far! Great flavor - shredded chicken!  Vermicelli - My friend got the B4 combo - this was fantastic!!! This is a perfect dish.  Its light and fresh and flavorful!",

The highest point of my experience here were the spring rolls, which were decent. However, the pho was just terrible. Usually I can finish whatever food I have (I'm not a picky eater), but this pho was so bad I had no choice but to leave, only having taken a few bites and tried to eat as much with seeming rude to the chef.   Note: To be fair, this was my first time coming to this establishment and I only hated (although this was a strong hate) their pho. I'm not sure if their other food is good, but I don't even want to find. That being said, good bye forever Dong Phung Saigon Bowl.   Overall: Service - 5 Food - 1 Wait time - 4 Cleanliness - 3",

The spring rolls were really good too but not as cold as i would prefer. The atmosphere is underwhelming and it was completely empty when we were there, but multiple people stopped by to pick up to go orders. Not exactly an impressive place for a date night but the food is fantastic. The staff was so friendly and accommodating by far one of the best places for pho I've been to in scottsdale!",

They have a fresh take on Vietnamese, which is what I love about Saigon Bowl. The staff is wonderful and truly cares about your authentic experience if you aren't familiar with the cuisine. I've never had a bad meal here. The food typically comes out super fast, which is great for days when you're in a rush. Plus, I love that they have a few boba choices (taro is my fave) and some of the best Thai iced tea I've had in the states. Love this place!",

Definitely the best pho I have had in Arizona. I come here so often that the waiters remember pho tai, as soon as they come to take our order. I definitely recommend the pork sausage spring rolls, which I believe they actually make their own pork sausage in-house. The service is what makes this place a complete 5 stars for me. The brothers that work the front are always super nice and remember you. Never any long waits and the food is out fast, hot, and fresh.",

Located in an almost empty \"shopping\" plaza, Saigon Bowl serves the traditional pho soups and many rice combination plates. I went during lunch time and got the spicy chicken with lemongrass. It was actually spicy and good. The price of the plate was only 5.75 since it was during lunch time. Fountain drinks are only $.99. Service was okay, not the best. Overall, I had a good meal. Probably will be back to try their pho. If you are not careful, you will drive right by it.",

    "text": "Sorry, but this place just doesn't stack up against other quality Vietnamese places around.  I ordered the 'Filet Mignon' pho to go. The packaging I must say was nice, with everything separated neatly and with care. Unfortunately, the flavors left a lot to be desired. I think that having the ingredients separated from the broth didn't lend itself well to the meal, since the flavors simply could not possibly permeate anything just by dumping it in.  The meat itself was pretty nasty and minuscule. It was soft and mushy, hardly what I'd call 'filet mignon'. I mean honestly, who would really think that could pass? And like I said, there was very little of it.  The broth was very bland with zero complexity. The noodles were chewy and the greens were still attached to the stem. Taking it off the stem might be a good idea for the future, just saying.   All in all, I was rather disappointed, sad to say. I wouldn't come back.",

To my dismay, I discovered mid-bite in a spring roll that there was actual dirt in the lettuce that was in the spring roll. I was mortified.

Due to recent management/ownership changes, the menu is now more focused on authentic Vietnamese cuisine including a selection of Banh Mi.  For lunch I sampled Com Ga Roti (Crispy Cornish Hen w/ rice), Canh Ga Chien Nuoc Mam, and Nem Nuong Cuon. All three items were very flavorful and tasted incredibly fresh--clearly made to order. Regardless of what entree you choose, I highly recommend ordering Nem Nuong Cuon (K1) as an appetizer. It's a rice paper roll with grilled pork sausage, lettuce, various Vietnamese herbs, and deep fried egg roll wrappers which adds a nice contrasting textural element. Nem Nuong Cuon is served with a special orange-hued dipping sauce. And although I have no idea what's in it, it's so good that I could eat it straight up.   Some added pluses include friendly, courteous service, and clean bathrooms. Employees offer you water while you wait for your take-out order. Updated decor, lighting, and dinnerware also improve the dining experience here.",

The owners always welcome us and make it a point to thank us for coming in again, which I can tell is from the heart. What a pleasant feeling in such a hectic world.",
