    "text": "So I am a thai food enthusiast, especially when i travel. At least one meal out of my trip is saved for thai food specifically. However, with no access to a car this time, delivery was of the utmost important to me, especially when i'm sick like today.  i was exceptionally happy when i found this restaurant on yelp, & punched in my address & voila! They do delivery. Because i have dietary restrictions, I called in my order to avoid the confusion of being over/undercharged for my substitutions.  The girl I spoke to was very polite & friendly, which is the only reason this restaurant got a second star. She took my order, got my form of payment, and said the delivery will arrive in about 15-20 minutes.  A few minutes later a different number with a different area code calls me, so I answer: me: hello? guy: hi... uhhh... you *mumbles* sabaimodernthai? me: im sorry? guy: you just ORDERED from sabai modern thai yeahhh? me: yes i did guy: uhhh... can i get your address again? (at this point i should've hung up.. because thats sketchy move #1) me: i told the girl who i ordered through, *address* guy: uhh... whattt? i dont even... i dunno where that is. i mean... yeahhhh i dont go there. me: excuse me? im sorry, the girl i just ordered through got my address the first time around, and said it would be delivered in about 20 minutes. why is this a problem now? can I please speak to her again? guy: *yelling at the cooks* CANCEL THAT! CANCEL THAT ORDER!... no that one's ok... no CANCEL THAT ONE... uhmm... yeah i don't drive that far... sooo I can't do that. me: *frustrated* can you PLEASE put the girl I spoke to earlier back on the phone *guys shouting at the girl & the girl comes on* girl: hi im so sorry but I placed your order not realizing that its out of our area, so we actually cant take it that far. you could come pick it up, but we cant deliver it to your address. me: ok thank you please refund my card girl: we're in the process of doing that right now me: great thank you  Im not sure if she was afraid of apologizing for her mistake in the beginning, but putting that mumbling, rude, incoherent guy on in place of her was a bigger mistake than if she had just come on herself to rectify the situation. In that conversation he tarnished the reputation of the restaurant in my eyes, and even if i did have a hankering for thai food next time around & im able to go to the restaurant directly, I'd definitely choose a different option.",

We got the fresh spring rolls with shrimp and they were fantastic and crunchy and everything they were supposed to be. Boyfriend had the spicy noodles with chicken which were delicious and filling with a ton of chicken and veggies. He got medium heat and that was nearly too much for me since if you crunched down on some pepper it really gave you a zinger, but they were really good. I got the beef and broccoli with oyster sauce and it didn't disappoint. The veggies were fresh and crunchy and the beef was tender and the sauce was perfect. I got medium heat as well and had the same complaint - over all the heat wasn't bad until you got a big bite of pepper.   We will definitely be ordering from here again and would like to even go to the restaurant some time as well since its down the street.",

I haven't eaten a lot of Thai dishes, but I found every thing to be easy to understand and delicious sounding. I ended up getting a garlic chicken dish and it was on point. All the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. The vegetables weren't overcooked and still had a crispness to them. The egg roll I got on the side was great. The portion size is large. I would have taken a box to go for the rest of my food, but I was in walking distance to home and didn't want to carry it with me. My server was super busy and she held it all together magnificently.  I will definitely be back to try something else. Their lunch specials are great price, so it is a good time to check them out. They were also super busy the day I was in. People were waiting at the bar for tables to open up. The place is small, but has a modern comfy feel to it. I like it here.",

I ordered food food at 6:06pm and was given a delivery window of 7:06 - 7:16 ... that seemed pretty long but I ordered anyway. At 7:30 my food had not arrived so I called the restaurant and spoke to the \"owner\" Eric who proceeded to tell me to \"stay calm\" and the food would still be hot when it arrived ... told me that is was only 15 minutes past the OUTSIDE delivery window and to \"relax\" and wait for it to arrive ... even when I told him that the phone call was making me more irritated, not less irritated he tried to tell me what the drive time from his restaurant to my home was and that an hour and a half wait was not unreasonable ... since I drive by Sai Bai every single day I am well versed with the real travel time I knew that there was no reasoning with this guy. He certainly did not care about my business... when I told him that his attempt at customer service was definitely falling short and that I would be writing a review he made some snide comment and then he proceeded to HANG UP ON ME. I can assure you that was a first for me. I will do my very best to spread the word about this experience. The manager could of made me very happy with a sincere apology ... instead he was full of excuses, platitudes and sarcasm. Rest assured I will not be ordering again.",

    "text": "Driving up Thomas I almost swerved to the side when I saw a Thai restaurant in this part of town! Signs of the old Wendy's or Mexican restaurant that lasted for a month or 2 were nowhere to be seen, instead you had a very modern and inviting sign that even tells you how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. I was hooked, I could not wait to go and check it out. Upon walking in you are greeted by a very modern decor and it screams intimate dinners can be had here. The wood is dark, the tables are black and the lighting is mostly candlelit. The music was soft and contemporary, the only thing that seemed at odd was the flat-screen TV with sports on it. When the waitress handed me the menu, I was SHOCKED at the prices. I was also shocked that there was NO CURRY (besides massaman beef). The food smelled delicious, so I decided it was probably worth it to stay and give them the chance to woo me. After a few awkward moments of looking at the waitress and her trying to figure out if she should come over and take our order or give us more time she finally came over. We decided on 2 Thai iced coffees, crab won-tons as an appetizer and we would share the pad si ew.   If you've had Thai iced coffee, you can't wait to get the sweet milky goodness all mixed up to drink. This unfortunately was like drinking Folgers with some cream and sugar added, i was beyond disappointed to say the least. I should have had a clue though when I saw it being dispensed from one of those juice machines that you see in the the Mexican places with \"agua frescas\".   Anyhow, the won-tons come out, and they are possibly the prettiest things I have ever seen on a plate, they tasted amazing, but the filling was cold.   The pad si ew was nothing to write home about, for the price we did expect the portion to be larger.   Overall they did an amazing job in creating an inviting intimate atmosphere, it would definitely be better sans TV.   Service was ok.   Prices should definitely reflect location and the demographics of the area, I could just drive to Tempe and get a better meal that is cheaper.   Hope they adjust accordingly.",

The only service issue was the 50 minute wait for 3 dishes, which is not acceptable. It seemed like everyone around us was just waiting.",

I was puissed because we diddnt have it on us. Anyway we walked in and sat at the bar. Very cute modern rest. friendly bartender and I believe I saw the owner as well. We orderd springrolls. chix pad thai dish, pork dish. All exceptionally good. A must try if you live in the hood.Total price came to $36 for 2 people including tip and 1 beer. It's kinda like a PF changs style but thai. I was enticed by this place and bought 2 more gift certificates which will make my meal 12 bux next visit.",

We were promptly seated, and looked over the menu, settling on satay and littleneck clams to start with, then the mussaman and curry for entrees. The littleneck clams were very tasty, and the broth lively and sweet. The chicken for the satay was moist and tender, perfectly seasoned with a peanut sauce with a surprisingly light texture. I ordered my mussamon hot, but not Thai hot, and the spice gave me a workout. We finished it off with a mango mousse cake that had my wife and I fighting for the last bite. Nettie's service was friendly and warm, and definitely gave us a good reason to go back.",

Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker \"Modern Thai\" has become euphemism for \"Expensive Thai.\" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce.",

    "text": "We've driven by this restaurant a countless number of times and finally decided to stop by. The ambiance is casual and intimate enough that it would be a good place to go as a couple or small group (keep in mind that the Saturday evening we went, it was around 6:30pm or so and not busy at all).  When we sat down, we were given water with cucumber in it, which we thought was a nice touch & we ordered the Thai iced tea, which was really good (maybe a tad expensive, however, considering the glass was small & it cost $3).  After browsing the menu (and looking at some photos on Yelp) we settled on the SaiBai Fried Rice & the Pad Thai for our meals. The fried rice was really unique; it was seasoned with a curry powder which is definitely different  ... I personally haven't had anything like it at a Thai restaurant. There was an abundance of chicken, cashews, & cranberries in it along with a few pieces of shrimp (three to be exact), broccoli (again, three pieces), pineapple and some carrots. The pad thai was decent/good - I'm not a fan of pad thai to begin with so I only had a couple of bites. The noodles & meat were tossed in a sweet & sour type sauce. I guess I don't have much more to say about it but my date finished the whole plate so I guess he liked it!  We had ordered both of the dishes mild but in hindsight, I should've probably gotten the rice at a mild-medium or medium. Overall, because we liked the food & service, we'll probably go back.",

He decided to just avoid the shrimp and continue with the meal.  I took a bite of chicken and that had a sour taste.  We took a couple of bites of noodles.  No problem there.    The waitress came and I told her that the shrimp and chicken tasted odd.  She mentioned the chef put fish seasoning on them and that could be it.  She also wanted to know if I had tasted their Pad Thai before. Yes, and it was quite tasty a month ago.    The waitress took the platter and two plates away.  She came back and said because we ate half of the dish, the restaurant would only charge 50% of the $12 price.  Hummmmm, half of the platter was gone because it was on our two plates uneaten!  The waitress also said I should have told her immediately.   The first time you checked, wasn't soon enough?  Sad and disappointing.    Ultimately I did not have to pay for the dish but the restaurant acted like they were doing me a favor and I was a cheat.",

But we're also fat, so the restaurateurs of the world have settled for feeding us bland crap.   You can't really just throw some extra pepper sauce or chili powder into a dish after it's cooked and expect good results. Pretty sure that's what happened here when I told them I wanted my food spiced \"authentically\".   So, sure, it was hot. But it lacked the depth of flavor that develops from really cooking with spice so the end result was a strange combo of hot but bland.   Admittedly, given the choice between bland Thai and no Thai, I'll still take Thai, and everything was fresh and nicely prepared otherwise. So if you are not like me and don't enjoy setting fires on your tongue, you'll probably love the place.",

I've never tried a dish from here I didn't like but probably need to branch out more--I just can't get past how delicious my go-to's are!

So when they decided to drop the 3 shrimp that came with whatever meat you ordered on it, I thought that was pretty cheap.  The last 3 times I've ordered this, I've picked it up, got home to find no peanuts. Tonight, I called, I ordered, and specifically asked if we had to ask for peanuts or if they stopped pouring them on. She said they do or them on. I explained they haven't the last 3 times and to make sure they made it in my order. She said she'd make sure the order had peanuts. We got home, no peanuts. I called, they put me on hold forever, so I gave up. Now I'm leaving a negative report, rather than a positive one, all because they either didn't listen to me, or didn't care enough to make my order the way I asked.",

    "text": "I am updating my review based on my last 2 orders.  Food all of a sudden is BLAND. No spicy or flavor at all. I had the Spicy Noodle (which is my favorite) and there was NO spice or flavor...AT ALL. My co-workers and I ordered from this place twice in the last moths, and we got the same experience, bland boring food. Nothing compared to the first times I went here. I don't know if they changed cooks, but, I am definitely not getting food from here again, until I hear there has been improvements.   After living in Phoenix for 3 years, and seeing this little Thai Place so many times, I finally decided to stop by.  The place is medium sized, good ambiance, modern, and the service is quick and friendly.  I ordered from the lunch menu: Chicken Pad Thai, and the Spicy Noodle. To be honest, the pad thai was lacking flavor and color, it was bland. However, the Spicy Noodle was delicious! Garlicky and spicy, with veggies, egg and chicken with thick rice noodles...it was so good. I haven't tried anything else, but those 2 dishes; if you want a safe and savory plate, go for the Spicy Noodle.",

I was in a take out sort of mood, so as I sat at the bar the friendly owner gave me a glass of water with a cucumber slice in it.  I was pretty floored at how refreshing something so simple could be!  I quickly got my order of Garlic Shrimp (extra spicy) and headed home.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  So perfect that I can't think of any other shrimp to compare it to.  I was happy to see a decent crowd in the restaurant.  I know I'll be coming back again.",

I entered in my exact address and this restaurant showed in the search results for places willing and able to deliver to my location. I checked my banking account only to find out I had still been charged. I called SeBai back and was told it was an issue they needed to work out with EatStreet because (and I quote) \"You live in Old Town Scottsdale and it's too hard to delivery on the weekends.\" If this is a miscommunication between SeBai and EatStreet, how is it the customer's problem???? It's terrible customer service to refuse service AFTER it's been paid for...especially 30 minutes after the fact. My girlfriend orders from SeBai at least once a week but after this experience, we will find a new local Thai restaurant, and this time we will use Yelp.",

    "text": "I certainly had a 5 star food experience at this new, close to home establishment.  We arrived at around 8:30PM, and started off with the Crispy Thai Rolls and the Crab Wontons.  The Thai rolls were great, but who isn't a sucker for Crab Wontons that actually have a noticeable amount of crab and cream cheese in them? Not to mention, a small dot of Sriracha Chili Sauce on the top of the Wonton to give it a small bit of fire when you bite into it? They were a real hit, and the best that I am aware of around town.  Next was a Hot Pot of the CoCo Soup. It came out with the full effect of the flame shooting out the top of the Hot Pot, spiced between Hot and Thai Hot per our request. I must say that I was impressed with both, the soup itself, along with the tender cuts of white meat chicken, fresh mushrooms, and whatever galangal shoots are. I guess that those were more for texture. It was rich, but I swear that I could have eaten the entire hot pot if I were there by myself.  Next came the Seafood Green Curry. It was very flavorful, not a huge dish, but came with Calamari Rings, Shrimp, and fresh Clams with the Shell for effect. The dish was ordered Thai Hot, and was topped with a plentiful amount of fresh sliced uncooked Jalapeno rings. The Flavor of the Green Curry and the Jalapenos blended together very well. The dish was of course served with a side of white rice to spoon the goods over before eating to make it a bit more filling.  The service was great. We were served by the manager and met the Owners wife. She had just picked up their liquor license earlier that day, so we got to have a couple of glasses of white wine with our meal.  I wasn't overwhelmed by the prices, considering the quality of what we were served. Our tab was just under $54 for two people, and that included the wine.  I hope to continue to be impressed with this place, it was much better than I ever would have expected. I can't tell you how many times I have walked into a Thai place in the area and been royally disappointed in the flavor and quality of the cheap food. It takes a lot to make me this happy with a place. I wish them the best, and my first impression was love at first sight. Let's see how long this infatuation lasts.  Give them a shot, and then a deserving review to keep them on top of their game.  Cheers! :)",

They use fresh herbs; It came with a nice little salad for a total $8.00, generous portions for such a small price.  My last visit was a Thursday night for pad Thai, also very good but I ordered it mild. Order medium heat (flavor) it's not overwhelming hot.   The music is contemporary coffee house blend not the whinny Asian music you get at most Asian restaurants. A very comfortable atmosphere for an intimate conversation, relaxed, clean and friendly. They make a good mojito too.",

That's not the case here, you can really taste all the different flavors and spices in the curry. It's so good that I could have it with just rice. I have gotten the red, green, and yellow. Out of the three the green has been my favorite, but it's not for the faint at heart. I love the heat so I always order it hot. If you can't handle spicey the yellow is the way to go. The restaurant is very comfortable and cool on the inside, it's a nice place to go for lunch to beat the heat. They always play good music too, which is nice when you just want to chill out. The staff is also very friendly, and the service is super fast, I've never waited long than 10 minutes for anything, and that's even a stretch for time.",

    "text": "So, I had been wanting to try Sa Bai, a fairly new Thai restaurant near me, and I was hoping for the best.... Well, I thought that the food was okay, but over-priced. The service was fair, to slow, and there aren't enough choices on the menu.  In other words, you can't choose a dish (say green curry) and then also choose your meat (hmm, say chicken). (boo!) The only option they have at the bottom is that any dish can be ordered vegan or vegetarian.  We ordered the crab puffs for an appetizer. These arrived with a teeny little side of salad and were over-browned on top, but nicely presented. I was, however,  pleasantly surprised to see that they actually had crab inside (instead of most Asian restaurants that seem to just wave a piece of crab over them and call them crab puffs).   We also ordered three entrees; yellow curry vegan style, seafood green curry (which I requested have no calamari or clams in it) and the standard Pad Thai noodle dish (my favorite).   The yellow curry was flavorful, but didn't have enough heat to it and was a bit too sweet. The seafood green curry had some nice flavor and heat, but arrived barely warm and I found two pieces of calamari in it, so apparently they just picked out the clams and calamari before serving it to me and failed to add any extra shrimp or scallops. Seriously? What if I had been allergic to either clams or calamari?  They also used jalapenos which I feel is rather mundane when there are so many other hot peppers they could have used. The Pad Thai was the best thing we had, not too greasy, but only two shrimp in it (stingy).    I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> $25 certificate, so the server decided to automatically add a 18% tip on to the bill. That really rubbed me the wrong way - did she think I wouldn't be able to calculate her tip on the WHOLE amount, or that I might reduce her tip because of the kitchen screw up? The server did comp our drinks because of the calamari incident, but we only ordered tea and one soda so big whoop. You can hit most other Thai restaurants and get MUCH more variety at a better price.   Final notes: The server never asked us how mild or spicy we wanted our dishes and there doesn't seem to be any actual Thai people working in the restaurant. You can TOTALLY tell it's an old Wendy's - it lacks any atmosphere or ambiance. It's seems to be trying to be hipster and trendy but it's WAY too bright and too loud and it's at 44th and Thomas, so... I will NOT be returning as there are MUCH better Thai restaurants more reasonable priced near me.  Finally...There are no kids' choices and I HATE cucumber in my water!!!!!",

I am a creature of habit and almost always get the classic (yellow) curry with tofu, but occasionally I'll live dangerously (haha) and get the sweet & sour Thai style (sooo good, the sauce is so tasty and I love that it has cucumbers in it) or the spicy noodle.

    "text": "I ordered takeout and thought that the staff was very pleasant. The price tag was a little on the high side, but I was in the mood for Thai and have been wanting to try this place for a long time. I ordered the crispy thai rolls, spicy seafood soup hot pot, cashew chicken and the lemongrass & eggplant chicken.   The thai rolls were a little too sweet (I like to leave that task to the sweet chili paste, but because it was already so sweet, I couldn't even add that to it).  The spicy seafood soup was EXCELLENT! We really enjoyed the flavor of the broth and the wide variety of morsels in it. I would go back for this one.  The cashew chicken was ok, but didn't really have much flavor to it and the sauce tasted quite a bit like the sauce for the lemongrass & eggplant chicken.  I LOVE eggplant. It's one of my favorites, especially in thai food. However, the lemongrass & eggplant chicken wasn't very impressive. The eggplant was undercooked, which pretty much just had me pushing it, what is usually my favorite part, off to the side.   Wild Thaiger and Thai Hut will remain my go-to places for the time being.",

    "text": "Had dinner on Friday.  It was happy hour which meant that it was $2 off the appetizers.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps. They came with peanut sauce and sweet sauce on the side.  Very tasty and crunchy with cashew and noodles. Main dishes were Beef with Broccoli in Oyster Sauce.  The server asks you how spicy you want it and I said very spicy (to her this meant Thai Spicy)  The second dish was Chicken in Sweet and Sour sauce.  The Beef dish was spectacular in flavor and I ate all the broccoli (which I usually do not eat at all) because it was al dente (broccoli was not soggy or overcooked).  I really, really enjoyed it.  My companion liked the sweet and sour sauce but felt the chicken was overcooked.  I checked it out and agreed.  But the sauce was very good.  Our server Netty? came by often to check on how we were doing and how we liked our food.  She made sure our water glasses were kept full.  The water had cucumber slices in it which made it taste super refreshing.  We had a $10 coupon from the card deck that is sold in participating restaurants so we saved a few bucks. The bottom line is that we finally found a Thai restaurant that we like and is open 7 days a week.  OOPS, forgot to tell you that there is a nice guy playing the guitar and trying to sing classic melodies.  It was a nice touch. Can't blame a guy for trying.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place since it has lots of reviews and 4 stars. I figured it must be good!  It is a rarity that I find Yelp to be inaccurate based on the ratings of others.  I was extremely disappointed!   The lady who seated us and waited on us was blatantly rude.  I have never had such terrible service, anywhere, ever!  She seemed angry at us just for coming into the establishment.  I figured at least the food would be good, based on the reviews of my fellow Yelpers, however, it was NOT!    The Pad Thai noodles were overcooked, and the dish was bland.  There were no sprouts to help offset the sogginess.  The dish was not served with lime.  It was easily the worst Pad Thai I've ever had, and Pad Thai happens to be my favorite food, so I eat it all the time, and from lots of different Thai restaurants.  I didn't care for their lettuce wraps either, but something like Pad Thai should be a staple at a Thai restaurant, and should certainly not disappoint as theirs did.     The atmosphere was nice enough.  It looks like the location used to be a Wendy's or something, and they've fixed it up nicely.  It lacks a lot of Asian flare, but that is the least of their worries based on having experienced their food and service.    What a shame - they even have a drive-thru!  I certainly would have been back, had it not been such a negative experience.    Recommended Thai Restaurant alternatives: Wild Thaiger, Malee's, and Soi 4 Bangkok Eatery to name a few of my faves.  Wild Thaiger has my favorite Pad Thai and is also in the Phoenix area as opposed to Scottsdale like Malee's and Soi 4.",

And it was really good.  Sometimes I go to restaurants and they ask what level of spicy I want and I always say the hottest/Asian spicy and they it's usually pretty mild. Well this time I actually got real spicy.  I'm Korean and I was happy with the level of spiciness. ^_^ It wasn't so spicy that it took away from the flavor, bit it still made me sweat a bit!  I'm not too familiar with Thai food, so I'm not sure what to compare it to . The waitress was really nice and she came often to give me more water! I wish I remembered her name but she was young.  I am going to remember this place next time I'm in town.  She also kept mentioning the avacado curry to people so I'll have to try that next time!",

As usual, I have to try their steak salad.  The owners were there and greeting and serving.  I got to try their \"house\" soup which was in some kind of chicken broth with soy sauce, lot's of white pepper and chunks of veggies.  Decent.  I had asked for the steak salad not to be so runny because it can be made really wet and/or too spicy and I just don't like it!  And probably because my mom makes some of the BEST Thai steak salad ever and every Thai restaurant I test to see how theirs match up to hers!  It was good not the best, but I would get it again for sure.  It's more Americanized than some other Thai places however, it was good.  I hope it stays around!",

You have a choice of soup or salad....... I asked the waitress what the soup was and she told me it was vegetable soup, that sounded good to me. I aksed her what she thought was better the soup or salad and she suggested the soup and she was rite the soup was very good. it was basically broth with some chopped carrots, and celery. my mixed veggies and rice was very good. flavourful and cooked just rite, not over cooked. They offer brown rice which is a big plus in my book. my friends meal pad thai he really enjoyed it.  We will be back, they only complaint or negative I could log here would be the portion size. for 8 or 9 dollars for the lunch special. the portion was small. I never understand why most places serve small portions. especially since I only ordered vegetables. Its not like it would be a great expense to fill your plate with vegetables. my mates pad thai portion was on the plate but it did not cover the plate I mean it was such a small portion that you could see a lot of the porceilin plate.  So that's my only negative. Food was very tastey. just don't come very hungry. for lunch specials at least not sure how their dinner portions are.",

My husband got the Classic Curry with chicken, and it tasted the same way.    The lettuce wraps were friggin YUMMIELICIOUS!  And they are 1/2 price on happy hour.  I just wish the chicken the main dishes didn't taste like it came out of a microwave:(  it was very disappointing.    The Decor was good and peaceful.  Quite surprising considering I remember going in there years ago when it was a wendy's.   The service was pretty amazing.  But when I was leaving I noticed the female owner (recognized her from the website) parked in the handicapped spot.  As my mother was handicapped this really bothered me ALOT.    The thai iced tea was good.  I LOVE the fact that they put cucumber in the water, I am now such a fan that I do this at home as well.    If you are in the area, its worth a shot.  Do not order any chicken entree's.  Eat the appetizers instead.  I am very disappointed in the owner parking in the handicap spot (yes she drived a black SUV).    If you are in the area, check it out!  It's worth that for sure!  Thanks!",

I couldn't sl decide which one to order for pickup, but I finally managed to settle on the Sabai Fried Rice. The ordering process was simple and efficient from my laptop and they even had the estimated pickup time in the email confirmation. I drove there a few minutes beforehand, it's only 5 minutes from my massage studio, and it was ready for me at the pickup window.  The succulent aromas began wafting through the Explorer and I couldn't wait to dig in.   I opened the styrofoam takeout container and was shocked, there were at least 3 orders stuffed inside!  I dove in and enjoyed as much as I could before my next client arrived. After work, I took the leftovers and had a sumptuous dinner at home. I will definitely order takeout or come in for dinner again soon!",

We also enjoyed the Thai Iced tea, it was cold which I appreciated because some places give little ice with it.   I would recommend this place, it is very pretty inside with plants growing on top of a window. Pictures inserted. Also to end this the food in my opinion was great!",

We walked in at around 5:45 on a Wednesday and were the only couple there besides a few guests seated at the bar. Seated promptly by the server. Quite atmosphere and fast service (which is refreshing to write because sometimes during slow hours restaurants are understaffed and lack speed and servers) Ordered the crab Wontons to start which are delicious if you enjoy cream cheese! We however did not know there was cream cheese in them because it didn't say on the menu.. he can't eat them but I could! We got the mango mojito which was yummy as well. Then for my meal I got the Pad Thai. Wasn't what I was expecting but it was so delicious! He got a seafood curry number, he liked it but it wasn't as spicy as he normally likes it. Over all it was a great meal and we will be back again soon! Thanks!",

When I lived in Arcadia I loved Sabai Modern on Thomas, the sweet curry with tofu was one of my favorite things to eat. Now that I live in Tempe, I rarely go there anymore. So now I order from this \"On The Fly\" version in hopes that I get the same quality of food. It's not. The curry is always watery and lacking in flavor. The \"vegetables\" are mostly just soggy lettuce- which isn't supposed to be there. When I ordered the vegetarian at Modern they ALWAYS include tofu as a substitute for the chicken because you're paying for a protein, On The Fly NEVER includes my protein. Lastly I always get my curry Thai spicy, as in the most spicy option, and they dont put ANY spice, there was not one hint of pepper. When I ordered at Modern they not only put spices in the curry they give me more on the side. If you want flavorful Thai food do not order from here!! Lesson learned, never again ordering Thai \"On The Fly.\"",

The owners have done a great job of decorating the interior, and the touches are modern (cucumber slices in the water, service bar, etc)...but for good authentic Thai food, this is not the place. The service staff was two Asian ladies that were very friendly...but with the open kitchen in the back, I could clearly see that the cooks were two Mexican guys. Mexican guys making \"authentic\" Thai food? Hoping for the best, I ordered the Basil Chicken with vegetables (along with Pad Thai, this is probably the most basic, common Thai dish). However, this was disappointing, as the food lacked Thai flavor, the chicken was overcooked, and instead of having good Asian flavor...was simply spicy. Very disappointed. The Pad See-iew was ok, but acceptable at best.  Prices are generally $12-18 for dinner menu, so not the cheapest of Thai restaurants. Lunch specials were $8 or so. Looking at the menu, definitely an interesting menu of salads and soups that sounds good...so if you're someone that thinks Pei Wei is authentic Asian food, this is your spot. Good service, cute decor, great spot for a work lunch. But if you're about the authenticity and quality of the food, try the nearby Thai Lahna or La's Thai.",

They even explain what Sa Bai means right on their sign.  I decided from there I needed to eat lunch plus I love Thai food.  Came in and I was greeted with a smile and I knew -- oh yeah...this is gonna be good.  I sat at the bar, but it was tad bit early for a drink (plus I had too much last night) I always order the fried rice noodles at Thai restaurants -- I believe this makes or breaks a Thai joint -- Stir Fried Rice noodles w/ Chicken.  It came out so quick I thought I was at McThai-Food!  Though I know it was freshly made since it was steaming and the veggies were so colorful.  Result = smile on my face and a happy belly -- Burp!  Sa Bai indeed!  As for the ambience (Sa Bai dude!) -- it was definitely a fast food restaurant before, but they did well with their decors - lots of sunlight with a Bombay look.  Let's just say I walked back to the auto mechanic forgetting about why I was there in the first place. - Enjoy!",

I was greeted by the owner and his wife (the operations and chef) and sat at the bar for a quick to-go.  I wish I could have enjoyed a cold beer while waiting but they were still a couple weeks out on the liquor license...please hurry up!          I ordered the Pad Thai as it's an easy choice to gauge a new place.  I ordered it Thai hot and that is what I got!  The dish was super hot (as I wanted) yet still very flavorful with big shrimp and chicken.  I ordered without looking at the menu and was a little surprised by the $13 price tag but the food was really good so I'm not upset.  I will return once they have the liquor license and eat in to get the full feel of the place.  I think it is a little funny that they choose a old Wendy's to renovate but they made it work well enough.  Wendy's are tough to do much with once they close down so I am glad that it was taken up.  I care less of a place's location as the food that comes out of it.       Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "Wow. I can't believe this place has such good reviews. Either that or I just had the unfortunate luck of my first and only experience tonight with a horrible server  . I have worked in the service industry for ten years and went here with a former employee/ now manager of a restaurant. It is the first time we have ever left a zero dollar tip. Our female server rushed us over to a table, threw down menus, never even greeted us, and then hounded us to order (we got there at 9 on a tues, when they close at 10). So after rushing our order someone else brought our food out and we literally never saw our server again. I had ordered a drink, and wanted more but never had the opportunity to order one. We then watched as our server was spotted playing on her iPad at the bar. We had to yell out to her to please come over and bring us our check. It's a shame because the food was good, but I will never be back.",

Really really tasty and different.  My daughter got the curry.  Very good but wish we would have ordered it a little spicier.  You never know how much heat you are going to get with a Thai place so we always start with mild.  Will definitely order again!",

We were exhausted and we were famished, so I suggested to have lunch here since we were in the area.  The restaurant itself is rather roomy and clean. Pink flowers adorn every table which I thought was special.  Buddha sculptures and fortune plants are also on display.  They were running a lunch special entree for $8  which includes a soup or salad. I ordered the veggie delight and a Thai lemonade and mom dearest got the Pad Thai and Thai tea.  The service here was super quick and the dishes were delicious. The chef definitely made the dishes pretty and our waitress was super nice.  The only thing that bothered me was the music. It was a tad loud and distracting, so it was hard to enjoy a good meal. That said, I'm giving them 4 stars.",

We told the waitress and instead of offering something on the house she said that we will still be charged so they can only replace the dish. So we are sitting here waiting on the 2nd dish and they didn't put us on top priority...30 mins later and counting. Also the waitress wasn't empathetic and didn't give us honesty she says every dish is good which is False... or something is wrong with the restaurant's staff members' taste buds. Disappointing when a local restaurant can't compete because of wanting that extra $12. In exchange they're losing customers because we will not be returning. So we attempted at asking for a refund and again it was a no. So now we are taking a crappy dish home. Just terrible. So we are scared they did something to the dish so we are throwing it away because who knows what they did.  #terrible #dontcomehere #NotWorthIt",

We checked our their specials and decided to stray away from our traditional pad thai (I usually regret this). We ordered the chicken curry chow mein dish and the grilled salad. The chow mein was full of vegetables with a rich coconut curry sauce, the flavor was really good and portion size was generous. The salad came with grilled steak, fresh vegetables, and lots of mint, cilantro, and basil. This salad was also very good, lots of fresh flavor and healthy. I did not regret straying away from my traditional order of pad thai. My only complaint is that the chow mein was $18, which I consider a little pricey for Thai food. I would still definitely return.",

We have also tried the Crab Rangoon, Crispy Spring rolls, Pad Thai and Garlic Shrimp, and loved them all. The spiciness is always just what we expect and the flavor of the dishes keep us coming back. We also enjoy their specialty cocktails when waiting for our food. Their staff is friendly and the establishment is clean and decorated nicely.

When I got to my destination, I realized that my pad Thai was missing all the toppings (bean sprouts, green onions, crushed peanuts, crispy wontons), had barely any sauce and no spice.

    "text": "On my last visit to Phoenix we hungry ( yet lazy) so we decided to order delivery from SaBai Modern Thai.  We found the website very easy to use.  The menu items are sorted by type of food: appetizers, soups and salads, house specialties, stir fried entrees, etc.  When you select any item, a window appears asking you to designate a spice level for that particular dish on a scale of no spice, medium, Thai hot, mild, or hot.  You can also designate special instructions such as no onions.  I ordered my dish Thai hot, but my fellow diners stuck to the mild level.  I chose the Mussaman which consists of braised boneless beef short ribs in classic mussaman curry with potatoes, carrots, onions, whole peanut and cinnamon essence.  Our food was delivered quickly; everything was still hot, and the food was packaged securely enough that none of it spilled.  Things started out very well.  They ended well, too.  The dishes were generously portioned and quite delicious.  I couldn't finish all of my rice and curry, so I had enough left over for breakfast the next morning.  I didn't try any of my brother's dishes, so I can't comment on those, but mine was delicious.  The convenience of having food delivered right to the apartment was quite a treat.  I'd definitely order from here again.",

    "text": "Reviews have the stereotype that only those who have incredible or absolutely horrible experiences will leave a review. I guess I'm in the middle of the road leaving a review having had numerous good experiences at SaBai but one bad one that will likely keep me from returning.  I live relatively close and we've ordered takeout from here quite a few times. We were initially impressed with the generous portions (I could make one dish serve as two meals and that says a lot) and the great flavor. They're very quick too! Pad Thai is my go-to dish.  The Mussaman is great too.   Over the last 6-12 months, I've become less inclined to frequent SaBai. This is due to dwindling portions (which I was okay with to a point) and some poorly prepped meals: shrimp still cold, irregular levels of spice (I go medium), and had one that seemed like they accidentally dumped some sweet fish sauce in my pad Thai.   Well, it came to a head when I picked up dinner earlier this week. I get home and the container for my pad Thai is relatively empty. I'd say it was about 60% of a normal portion. I called SaBai to ask if this portion sounded right (they had been reducing the portions after all) and they agreed it did not. The individual I talked to said he put my name on \"the list\" and my next Pad Thai would be free. Great! It didn't satiate my hunger for that evening but I definitely felt better about the experience.   Fast forward to this evening. My wife decides to pick up dinner coming back from work.  She arrives and explains the situation only to be told by the manager that she was there when I called to question the portion size. (So, she was there when the guy told me that I'd be getting a free meal.) But, that doesn't matter. She said that she packed it and it was a normal portion. (I guess I'm lying then.)  She then suggested that,\"Maybe it was a different container (it wasn't) and I just thought it was a smaller portion.\" My wife rebutted with the fact that the manager just said she packed it herself (supposedly) so shouldn't she know if it was a different container. The manager then goes on to say that the person I spoke to was a delivery boy and had no authority to give me a free meal. (I guess that's my fault.). My wife was tired from her 12-hour shift so she just paid and left.   The pad Thai tonight was one of the better ones I've had from there in a while. It just adds to the frustration because I don't see myself going back there.",

I went here for dinner on a Monday night.. although we were the only people in the restaurant, the girl working was friendly and helpful, our food came out quicky and was pretty delicious.   The only thing that seemed odd is that who appeared to either be the owner or manager was there chatting it up with a couple who came in a little after us now making the population in the place a total of 4 customers. He never once stopped to say hi and see how our food was, make an effort to say anything to us.   Having worked in the restaurant industry in various positions including management, this really rubs me the wrong way. Making relationships with your customers is important and very easy when your business is slow.. that makes people come back and have a memorable experience.",

    "text": "Came here with some friends for dinner after work. I had high hopes for this place but I knew when I walked through that door that I shouldn't expect the food to taste like True authentic Thai food. I wanted to give it a try anyways because one of my co-worker loves this place and recommend that I come here. Right away you can tell it used to be a Wendy's fast food joint and the drive through window is still there. The place was nice and clean inside and the low lighting with the candles on the tables make it feel more intimate and romantic if you were on a date. They give you cucumber water which I absolutely enjoyed since that is how I drink my water sometimes at home. I wanted to try their Mango Mojito but they couldn't make it so I ordered the Holly Pop. Let's just say that I didn't like it whatsoever. It was too sweet and tasted weird to me so I barely touched it.   On to the food! I started with the Coco Soup and the Pad See-iew as an entree both with medium spice level. What can I say? The Coco soup was sour, salty, and creamy from the coconut milk but it was missing something. You can tell it didn't taste authentic. The Pad See-iew was a little bit too sweet and I couldn't taste any spice so I added more chili sauce. I also tried my friends food. One ordered the Avocado Curry, the other ordered Sweet Curry, and the last one ordered the Pad Thai. The Avocado Curry was actually quite tasty and flavorful. The Sweet Curry was bland and lack flavor. The Pad Thai was way too sweet and soggy. It was drowned in sauce or oil as you can see in my pic. Not appetizing at all. We ordered the fried bananas and ice cream to share for dessert. The bananas were wrapped like egg rolls and smothered with chocolate syrup. The outside was soggy and didn't taste like it was freshly made.   Overall I don't think I will be coming back to this restaurant unless my friends drag me here by my hair. I'm used to home cooked authentic Thai food with robust flavor and spices so if that's what you're looking for then I wouldn't recommend coming here.",

    "text": "I've had A LOT of Thai food in my day and this was my least favorite; ever. I found something that was suppose to be \"similar\" to a drunken noodle but I would probably only eat it drunk.  I think the dish was pad suiw so? The fat rice noodles were dry and hard, not fresh. There was so much sauce it made everything way too salty. The reason I love Thai for so much is because the veggies are always so lightly cooked, fresh, and crunchy but these carrots and broccoli were soggy. I was also confused as to why they feel a need to throw a scrambled egg into nearly every dish?!  I only did a take out order and the service didn't seem to bad. Although, the other server was stanging in the middle of the kitchen, eating soup, I didn't see her was her hands after. I know this because there is a mirror that you can view the kitchen, so maybe eat where people can't see?",

Very good and the portions were perfect. They didn't just have iceberg lettuce in the salad like most Thai places, they also had some spinach and other greens thrown in. For the entree I got the veggie delight. Lots of bamboo shoots, broccoli, carrots and fried tofu. They also can sub tofu for the other dishes like pad thai or fried rice and can take out the egg to make those dishes vegan. They had yellow curry on their lunch menu but didn't ask if they made it with fish sauce or pure coconut milk/cream. Loved the food and we came here on a chilly, rainy day so a hearty Thai meal really hit the spot.",

Coco Soup wasn't that good, I ended up not even eating it because the broth was a little overwhelming.  Also, you can only get Shrimp as an extra and not your main protein, even for additional cost. Not a huge deal, just weird I had to get a combo of meats and technically order extra (additional cost) in order to get shrimp. Hopefully this is a just a glitch in their online ordering system.  I eat and cook a lot of Thai food at home, so maybe I'm being a little critical, but I doubt I'd order from here again. Food wasn't horrible or anything, but for over $30 delivered I expected better.",

    "text": "It's funny how I came across this place. I have driven by it time and time again but never noticed it until I was eating across the street at a new BBQ Place and out of the corner of my eyes saw a Wendy's and thought, I never noticed there was a Wendy's there, and then noticed it wasn't a Wendy's, but it was a Thai Restaurant. I have a knack for architecture, so it was a late 90's Wendy's that had been converted into a Thai Restaurant. A month later for my birthday I went to the movies with my neighbor and her husband called and asked if she would pick up food. I recommended this place to them so we went for take-out. I ordered a Thai Tea, Pad Thai with Shrimp, no Bean Sprouts, and Spring Rolls.   I went home and opened up my dinner and it was just noodles. I called back and they had already closed, so the next day I took it in and told them and the woman working seemed very suspicious and somewhat annoyed with me and had to call the person who was working the night before. She then told me my story was confirmed and matched up so they would take care of it for me. I told her I would just use it for my lunch that day and I ordered a Thai Tea. For some reason my card wasn't working so I said sorry, not sure what's going on. She grabbed the Thai Tea back and put it away, just the way she did that really turned me off, for one even if I was having card issues, that's not the way to handle it, secondly, I was there because I didn't get to enjoy my dinner the night before and I had to drive back the next day so they could get the order right. If you aren't going to say \"hey, no worries, we are sorry about the inconvenience, this one is on us, enjoy!\" then please at least not be rude about it.  A couple of weeks later my friend wanted to take me to dinner and a movie as a post Birthday celebration and asked where I would like to go. I thought of a few nice places but thought lowkey, I am down for Thai and giving this place a shot again since it would be sitting down and nothing could go wrong.   When we walked in there were two tables, both had food already. They sat us and asked us right away if we were ready and we said we needed some time, then waved them over, but another party came in, then they got busy and 5 tables came in, and they took two of there orders before getting back to us. Then we waited for nearly an hour for our entrees. There was an older woman running around and a couple of younger women just sort of bringing things out here and there. No one apologized or seemed like anything had been done wrong. I was just trying to be positive and enjoy a dinner my friend was paying for, but it was irritating the lack of customer service and hospitatlity.

The setup is a little strange when you walk in but it's to be expected I supposed when they converted an old Wendy's drive through (pretty sure it was Wendy's).

Tom yum should be a clear hot and sour soup, should be spicy but this was very thick with chili, hard to describe but I only ate half of the small or bowl size serving because it wasn't very good.  The green papaya salad is definitely NOT authentic in flavor but I found it strangely addictive. It almost had a parmesan cheesey flavor to the dressing, I really hope there wasn't any cheese in there but it's the best way I can describe it. I would only order this again if I wasn't wanting a normal salad, but it tasted nothing like an authentic green papaya salad should.",

They come with an amazing dipping sauce and have a generous amount of crab not Krab in them which is what makes the difference from a lot of these cheap places in town.    For the entree I had the Seafood Hot Pot which is full of Shrimp, scallops, clams and calamari with tomatoes and sliced fresh mushrooms in a hot and sour lemon grass broth. I ordered it Thai hot which was great to open up my sinuses and keep my tummy warm : ).    Everything from the food to the service at this place is top notch.  Don't miss out on this one.",

First off the Pad thai was different from what i expected i'm used to flat thick noodles in my pad thai and it was instead 'invisible\" noodles which i like 10x better anyway! The Pad See-iew did have the flat thick noodles but had a taste that was unique so i have to give them a 5 as well.   The highlight of my meal was the FRIED BANANAS!! THey were bomb! I've never had them before and it was kind of like a cheesecake banana fried thing and was out of this world!",

Today they said 45 minutes and took 90 minutes - which is totally unacceptable when they charge $5 for delivery.  Food was subpar - flavor was off and barely any veggies in fried noodles and the Thai rolls were literally 90% wrapper and 10% filling.  Too bad, we desperately need a good thai place in Arcadia",

The awkwardly loud, clubbish music playing before sunset didn't help either. I was embarrassed when they complained to our waitress about it, but the fact that no one turned it down didn't help the situation.  When asked why our food was taking half an hour, the waitress blamed it on the fact that one of our dishes required grilled salmon. The restaurant was almost completely empty, and anyone who's ever grilled anything knows that that excuse is bullshittery. Redemption arrived in the form of green curry and pad thai, but not before my grandpa threatened to walk out (too bad DQ was his only other option).  Overall, the food was above average in its category (particularly the sauces), and I enjoyed the setting, but the lesson's been learned. This is probably not a family spot. I'd go back if I was with some friends in the area, but if the kitchen makes a habit out of taking their sweet time, I'm out.",

I did order for delivery once and I was bummed about my food that arrived. I typically order Pad Thai and it usually has great flavor with a lot of chicken and shrimp. When I had ordered for delivery it was very dry, low on sauce and the chicken seemed like it had a different texture due to the dryness. Another favorite is the lettuce wraps! The peanut sauce and the flavor is AMAZING!  I did try to order the Thai hot once as I thought I could handle it and I was completely wrong. They do warn you that it is very hot, and even the waitress says she can't handle it, but they did offer to give me a new plate for free which I thought was great. Since it was my wrong doing I declined the offer, but it shows what great customer service they offer.",

I've had many things on the menu and the only things I haven't liked are the curry dishes which I love at other Thai restaurants.  Every dish you are able to choose the spice level which is nice because I like it hot!  Thai tea is really good here too and helps with the spice.",

It was ordered through grub hub . The restaurant posted a 25 minute ETA on prep time yet took over an hour. The menu said the curry came with cucumber salad. It did not . When I called grub hub they confirmed this, and said if that's the case they did not update their menu. SaBai said they no longer include the salad. When I complained no effort was made to correct it. So many good Thai Restaraunts around pass this one by.",

The Pad Thai was OK.  I found it to be on the slightly sweeter side but it was good enough to satisfy my Thai cravings.  The crispy rolls were pretty unique to me as I've never tasted anything like that before.  The filling was an unusual blend of veggies but I still liked it enough to finish the order.  I would not order from here by myself but if the group decides to get Thai again, I will probably join them.  There are other Thai places I would choose first over this.",

One day I order, which probably was a month later, I asked for the same order including the yellow curry on the side and they server said sure.

The other two with shrimp were like drenched in a sweet and sour sauce - had no bean sprouts (when we asked for extra) and had completely different flavor.  It's the same dish just different protein. They should not taste like completely different dishes.  We both had a few bites and it was so sweet and covered in sauce we ended up tossing our lunches.

So we get the exact same thing every time (curry vegetables or curry tofu vegetables). Sometimes it's really spicy when we order mild, and the tofu may be fried when we order steamed. I wouldn't order online unless you like surprises. Also, they charge $2 extra per dish for brown rice, making it $34 for two _veggie_ dishes, before tip.  I'd recommend dining in if you are a picky eater (vegan). They have a full bar and there was nice acoustic guitar when we've dined there and the food is good.",

The waitress never took our drink order until 10 minutes of sitting down.  The waitress never even paid attention to our table at all. It surprised me because there was no one in the restaurant. I would never go back just because the service was horrible. But, the food was not very good either. It's mediocre Thai food. And I ordered hot for my spice level and it tasted like a mild spice level. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

In my personal opinion, you can always tell the quality of a Thai restaurant by the Pad Thai.   That said, I was honestly pretty un-enthused by the place. The music was your typical radio music. The servings were pretty small. And the waitresses were not that great. It took close to ten minutes for the waitress to come along and refill my friend's water.   In recap: pretty good food, but the rest was not something that I was overly impressed with.",

Well, after deciding upon walking home from the airport and then deciding it was too hot and too far, I found myself outside SaBai.   I thought, what a perfect opportunity to grab some water and a bite to eat. I went in, it was a Tuesday and just after lunch (1:00 pm). I was seated immediately and brought some water. I started with their spring rolls that came with a side salad doused in peanut sauce. I skipped the salad, enjoyed the rolls. I also ordered the veggie curry and when given the option for spice level, I went Thai spice.   It was warm and spicy but still full of flavor. I often worry that the spice will ruin the flavor, that was not the case here. It was full of veggies but the way it was laid on the plate had me not want to make a mess. I took a few bites and decided to take the rest to go. Which I would probably just place a to-go order if I stop in again. I understand the presentation effort but for me, I guess I wasn't as appreciative that it was all compartmentalized a bit.   Pricing wasn't too bad, nor was the food or service.",

The taste was okay, but not what I would consider authentic Thai flavor. I barely got any hint of the basil.  It could have been any type of fusion Asian cuisine. The rice was NOT jasmine. I think it was sushi rice. The service was good. My drink was refilled 3-4 times. Medium was plenty hot enough for me. I was only offered the choice between mild and medium.   Overall, the food here tasted okay. But since I wanted Thai food, it didn't quite do the trick. I might go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my for SaBai Modern Thai.

    "text": "It was a Friday evening. We had been driving for an hour, mired in indecision.  After some deliberation, we ventured out to Arcadia and stumbled upon a neighborhood gem.  Upon entering, we were greeted by this vibrant and energetic lady who seemed to be handling all aspects of order taking and serving all by her lonesome. She was a bundle of energy, and seemed as if she could take on the world at the same time.  We expected to wait awhile, as she seemed distracted between the takeout order customers, and the ones already seated.   Not So!  She found us a table and hurriedly gave us our menus. After doing so, off she went -just like the cartoon character, the Roadrunner!  We were famished. It was now approaching 8pm. Everything seemed so good on the menu. It didn't help much that a quick review of our esteemed Yelper's reviews were all over the place in their dish preferences.  We pulled the trigger on several items. For starters, we chose the Clams in Wine Sauce. For our main course, we opted for the Classic Yellow Chicken Curry, the Satay Beef, and the Thai Sweet & Sour Chicken.  For good measure, we made it known that we wanted to sample the Fried Bananas and Ice Cream Dessert. That should've rounded out our dinner selection quite nicely.  Our Clams arrived, and we were immediately impressed. The Wine Sauce was richly flavored. The Clams were succulent and tasty. Needless to say, we devoured these as soon as they were laid in front of us. Our hopes and expectations were so elevated due to the marvelous introduction we had just experienced.  However, this is where the disappointment began. The Satay Beef was under-cooked. I am not sure what happened to this, but all we tasted was warmed over meat on a skewer. It was flavorless, and nearly raw. No amount of the peanut and cucumber sauce could mask the spiritless rendition of what should have been a masterpiece dish. Then came the Yellow Curry Chicken. The sauce was rich enough, but it was completely vapid - devoid of any of the flavors that enliven one's palate.  The final dish was the Thai Sweet and Sour Chicken. There was neither anything sweet nor sour about this dish. It tasted as if the sauce had been far too diluted to the point that all its richness was supplanted by its decreasing volume.   The main dishes were acceptable for consumption. But, they were not what we were expecting from a Thai restaurant. Typically, these dishes are so zesty that every bite is an experience.  At this point, we were so disheartened that we just wanted to depart. However, we nearly had forgotten that we had ordered dessert well in advance. So, we stayed for that, expecting further disappointment.  The Fried Bananas weren't sweet enough. But, the Ice Cream and the Chocolate sauce definitely made up for the lack of sweetness. It was a good enough recovery from our otherwise bland experience.  Throughout all this, we were still mesmerized and amazed as to how our server / hostess managed to maintain her aplomb with regard to our service. She didn't miss a beat, and although she was harried many a times, she managed to maintain her composed demeanor.  That, at least, elevated our otherwise deflated experience.",

It felt like the dish was more of a fusion of Mongolian beef / almost your usual  pad gra prow,, wish I was craving more for. But they don't have that on the menu.   Number 3 spicy, is not spicy at all. So if you want spicy maybe put more emphasis on telling them to be Thai spicy.  The waitress or waiter was super attentive and pretty quick with service. Friendly overall. No issues there. Inside was pretty clean even though outside looks different or not as fancy. Parking is not an issue. Pricing is Usual thai price around $14.

I can really complain, however I do wish that the features would change at least one time during the year. I like the owner and his wife... great people, very approachable and Eric can be quite entertaining if you would like to chill at the bar and just talk. His wife Holly is equally as nice and although a bit more quite than her husband she works in the kitchen and really has passion  Great place good food and I will be returning and telling my friends about this place",

Overcooked rice noodles, rubbery chicken and absolutely flavorless. I tried to eat it, and finally told the waitress (when she made it to our table) that it was flavorless....she offered to \"remake it\" which turned out to just be having the cook add more sweet soy sauce so it came out darker. I again told her it wasn't good, and she actually asked if I wanted to take it to go. No offer to comp it or even offer a discount since I left 90% of it. I would never go back. This is NOT how Thai food is supposed to taste!",

The chicken in the Sa Bai fried rice was tough. But the worst was the Mussaman curry. Very different from before. The curry was runny and watery. The beef was not tender like it used to be - it's like a poor quality beef or something. It was hard and lacked flavor. The potatoes were also not as tender. Anyway, I'm sad that the quality has degraded.",

They served in on giant mushy chunks that I had to eat around. Guess I should've realized 'Modern Thai' may have meant a sterilized Thai experience. Other than having no idea how to make tofu (buy a tofu press first), the noodles were just okay at best, more akin to what you'd expect at a mall food court or something.",

Excessive gristle (one piece is too much but it happens) in the food, a few of us felt a bit sick the next day and overcharged for one item, which initiated a call to the restaurant.  After being told the manager was not there, the owner came on the phone and after advising him of our poor experience said he would look into it and call me back.  We are slightly short of a week and there has been no call back. I called again later in the week and asked to speak to the owner again and advised he stated he would call me back and was told tersely he was not in and a message would be left.  No call back.  Here's the thing, SaBai has lost a customer.  We understand that things can go wrong in food service but to not have the courtesy to follow up with the level of issue we raised is just not acceptable.  I write very few reviews but felt others should know about this.  Thank you.",

    "text": "My party of 3 visited SaBai on a last-minute whim on Sunday night at about 8:15 PM. We ended up being the only ones in the place, as two other parties were leaving as we arrived.  We were greeted and seated quickly, and staff were friendly and efficient throughout our meal (they had nobody else to take care of).    Atmosphere is pleasant, upscale for the neighborhood, dimly lit, slightly romantic. Cloth napkins and wood floors. Not Asian-themed, but nice.   Food was quick to arrive and tasty.  Their \"medium\" spice level is pretty mild, as Thai food goes, so if you're looking for spicy, I assume you need to ask for \"hot.\"  It's a little pricey for the area and quality, at $12-16 per item.   We had the Coco Soup, which was really excellent.  The Curry was good, though again, not as spicy as one would expect.  Pad Thai was OK, but it had some weird kind of crispy won tons on top, which I've never seen on Pad Thai before. I didn't detect any peanuts in it, and other reviewers are correct that there were no bean sprouts or lime.  Chicken and shrimp were present, but not plentiful in this dish. I'm all for adding The Chef's own style to dishes, but with a staple like Pad Thai, I think you need to stick to tradition and what customers are expecting.  There also happened to be a guy playing guitar and singing in there. He had some skill and musical talent, although didn't seem to be able to finish a song. Just noodling around, changing tunes constantly, and it seemed like he was practicing licks or something. This didn't really detract from our meal. It was just weird, especially for a Thai restaurant.  Overall, a decent experience, and there's better, cheaper Thai food nearby, so based mostly on price, I probably won't be rushing in there again except for special occasions.",

Strong taste of crab and the sauce was very flavorful. The entrees were far too soupy. Either serve the ingredients with plenty of sauce...or drown the dish in muck and call it a SOUP or a STEW.   I ordered the Mussaman (braised beef) which was quite flavorful, but the dish was a mess. It was just pieces of onion, scalloped carrots and tender beef lost in a bowl full of broth. I thought I ordered a beef dish...not a soup? And why scallop a carrot? Leave the vegetable alone. Round carrots are fine.   Choo Chee Seafood was also ordered, with the same result: lost in a soupy mixture with no substance.  It took FOR-EV-ER to get our check. I almost got up to beg the waitress for our tab. It wasn't even busy, so it's not like she was behind.  With all the attention to the decor and overall look of the restaurant, I'm a little saddened that the food has been overlooked. A pretty high price was paid for a mediocre meal.",

The inside is beautifully modernized and offers a nice, clean, upscale, and accommodating atmosphere. At night, when the lights go down and the candles are lit, SaBai Thai is a perfect spot to take a date.   They have an EXCELLENT happy hour, but their normal drink prices are incredibly reasonable as well. I can't tear myself away from the $4 bottle of Sake ($1 off beers/spirits and $5 glasses of wine on HH). I generally sit up at the bar to shoot the shit, but happy hour is good throughout the restaurant.   As far as food is concerned, I am absolutely addicted to the lettuce wraps (tofu easily substituted) and the classic yellow curry, but the SaBai Fried Rice and the eggplant dish are delicious as well.   The staff is incredibly friendly, especially Chris and the owner Eric who you can see bopping around from table-to-table making sure the guests are taken care of. His wife, Holly, mans the back of the kitchen and together they have created the perfect Modern Thai environment.  In additional to the great atmosphere, delicious high-quality food, great drink prices, outstanding happy hour, warm and attentive service, they also have GREAT hours, especially for an Asian restaurant. Most Thai places close from 3-5 and don't do Sunday lunch service. SaBai Thai's modern take grants us Thai lovers action all day long, 7 days a week!  I think even Mr. Sheen would agree, SaBai Thai is a WINNER!!!",

Don't be fooled by the fact that they have a drive-up window for phone order pickups (maybe that just shows how popular they are, and it's a plus that people are not constantly coming and going through the door for takeaway). The atmosphere is nice inside, the staff extremely friendly and efficient, plus it's smart that they offer diners a full bar. I can't wait to go back on my next visit to Phoenix.",

I ended up switching dishes with my boyfriend for his sweet & sour tofu. He liked the curry, but he wasn't the one paying.   The music and atmosphere was not too great either. Sad indie music played the entire time.   I did love the water with cucumber. I would go back for the water and maybe try the desserts next time. However will not be ordering curry here again.",

FOOD: the crab wontons were very good, but at a $1/per small wonton, they are a bit pricey. The Choo Chee seafood was a bit disappointing. For $14 I would have expected more, but all I got were literally 2 small scallops and 2 shrimp, a few \"O\" rings of calamari (no tentacles, my favorite) and several clams. Since this was previously a Wendy's restaurant, I keep thinking: \"where's the seafood?!\" The sauce was also very thin and soupy and lacked the multitude of flavors and spices I usually expect in Thai food, not to mention that I didn't see any Kaffir lime leaf garnish. And why were there Jalapenos in this dish? Is this some sort of Mexican influence coming from the kitchen staff?  SERVICE: very friendly and attentive at first but had to wait a very long time (over 20 minutes) just to receive the check.  Conclusion: overpriced for what you can get comparable or better elsewhere (Wild Thaiger, Tom Yum), especially where the chefs are actually Thai.",

The food was wonderful and if you are worried about the food being too spicy, or not spicy enough- they make everything to order.    We had terrific Tom Yum Soup, the lettuce wraps, Salmon Curry, Drunken Noodles and a chicken and avocado curry.  I would recommend any of these dishes.   They have a full bar.  Best yet for all the food and drinks our bill was under $100.  Pretty amazing.",

The dishes we ordered were: Coco Soup & Cashew Chicken washed down with a Mango Mojito, and ended with fried banana spring rolls with coconut ice cream.  The service was friendly and good; but the food was fair to average.  The cream cheese filler in the fried banana spring rolls was an unfortunate distraction to the taste.",

We started with the crab won-tons and frankly did not like them, the flavor was as if the cream cheese was left out too long and I hated the addition (even though it was a drop) of sriracha sauce on top. Then the soup, a Thai staple, Tom Yum, the broth tasted like sugar was copiously mixed into it. Too sweet for my palate. For entrees we had the basil classic and the sai bai fried rice, both were just very bland nothing to remember . And last but not least I like to rock out with best of them and I admit the music that was playing was aces but way too loud. The service was OK but almost awkward, definitely was missing that certain appeal that can make or break a restaurant.  It seemed like the bar patrons were front center and the restaurant took a back seat but I usually don't go to Thai places to get my drink on. Wished it was better.",

I had a shrimp stir fry and it was cold when it came out. The server said it came with noodles, turned out it didnt so i asked for some and was charged for something she said was in it to begin with. Overall it sucked and hope they hire a new server and a quick lunch wouldnt be over an hour long.",

The lunch specials are a great deal -- for $8 you can choose from about ten options, each of which comes with soup of the day or their house salad.  We had the salad, which arrived on a pretty little square plate and had a delicious, limey peanut-sesame dressing.  Usually the side salads at Asian restaurants are kind of throwaways, but we would order this one again.   The Tom Yum soup is also delicious.  We will be back for lunch and probably for dinner too once they get their liquor license.",

Someone mentioned the TV, but I don't mind it.  You can sit in the dining area and ignore it, or really not even see it.  But it's nice if you are alone or want to watch a game, and sit at the bar.  The owner's enthusiasm was awesome.  Really nice person.  And the food was great.  I had lemon grass eggplant, and the eggplant was done perfectly - not too oily, mushy, or undercooked.  This is a fete few Thai restauarants master.  The dish was wonderfully infused with basil. My husband had the spicy noodles, which was also excellent (although he ordered it hot, which was a bit much for me).  We got to try the Thai lemonade (really different, mixed with tea and ginger), Thai iced tea (tasty), and the awesome Thai mocha (dessert in a glass).  People should stop complaining about the price - this is really nicely done food with great ingredients (plenty of vegetables, lots of fish dishes, good meats).  And it's well executed.  Nor are the dishes small.  The prices here are not by any means out of line.  More than sloppy low mein, but you get what you pay for.  And here the food is well worth the cost.  I wish SaBai well, and we'll be back!",

Not only was it way overcooked and chewy there was only 2 pieces of shrimp in the whole meal. For fourteen dollars, i expected much, much better. Not to mention that the overall flavor just wasn't to great and the noodles were soggy not at all like the regular rice pad thai noodles you usually get. We also had a problem with the service. We ordered our food togo, when we first picked up everyone was very nice and kind. Once we got home we realized that our large order of coco soup was extremely spicy when we ordered medium spicy and our small order of coco soup was not spicy at all when we ordered it to be thai spicy. We ordered the large not super spicy so that we could feed it to our kids who like food a little spicy and a special small order of super hot for my mom.  To make that simple they messed our soups up. lol when we called them to let them know about the soup mix up, they were rude and insisted that we were WRONG!!  I was completely shocked. It was a complete waste of fourty five dollars. I will never return to this thai place again which is a shame because it's so close to us.",

Lunch specials are priced from $8-$10, which is $1-$2 per plate more than most other Thai places around town, so I was expecting some really decent food.  Alas I was sadly disappointed. I ordered the green curry beef jalapeno and my spouse ordered the spicy noodles with chicken. My green curry dish was simply not very good.  There was little beef or jalapeno in my curry, which consisted mostly of a gooey green curry base artificially thickened with cornstarch. My husband's noodle dish was much better, but unremarkable considering the price and small portion size. Both the dining room and bathroom were very clean and well kept, so Sa Bai impressed me as a nice place to maybe go on a first date, but I certainly won't be back for the food anytime soon.",

When a girlfriend of mine and I walked in we saw the specials for the day and when I saw avocado curry I was sold since I'm addicted to avocados. We got the lettce wraps which was good (wish it didn't come with iceburg though) and got it simply because it came with I believe their sweet and sour sauce AND the peanut sauce. LOVE peanut sauce. From what I saw, they had a full bar. Beer selection was good, nothing on tap though which makes me a sad panda. I had to order the thai tea which was very good and tried the thai coffee, also good. Avocoda curry was amazing! Though when I got the bill I was sad to see that it cost $18... I understand that when they say it's the special, it means that they don't serve it on their everyday menu. I'll most def be back, very good place! P.S. Came on a Monday night.",

Food - 4/5 Papaya salad was fresh, but the fish sauce was a little too strong Fried rice was good with pineapple bits  Pad see ew was good, not too oily  They ran out of thai iced coffee 0/5 Thai iced tea was great  Cleanliness 5/5  I will be coming back for the great service and food.",

We weren't disappointed. We had two appetizers, two entrees, and dessert. The appetizers were good but not great - the crab wontons were tasty but a little too saucy for me; the crispy thai rolls were a bit generic - a little oily, lacking some in flavor.  However, the main dishes more than made up for this. We had the pad prik king, and pad see-iew. Wow! Both were flavorful and perfectly spiced - not overwhelming, just enough to enhance the flavors and give a little kick. We both really, really liked these dishes.   Deserts were again good but not overwhelmingly awesome. The prices are reasonable, moreso if you get the happy hour pricing on drinks and appetizers. Service was excellent, btw. Friendly and timely.  We will definitely be coming back to SaBai, and look forward to working our way through more of the menu.",

I have try the pad thai and it is very well prepare (but I usually add some more lime juice, sugar and thai dry hot pepper just for my taste). With Thai food, you suppose to add these things (ask for them) and additional spice yourself. It is a tradition. Anyway for curry, I like the mussaman. They only have the beef mussaman. I wish they have chicken mussaman too - like in Thailand. Another dish you should try is shrimp basil classic. It is sooo good. Recommended!",

    "text": "I wasn't really a big fan of the pad thai here at first; however, couple visits ago, I went here, I guess my taste buds and the pad thai created a little bond.   First off, the food:  Pad Thai (chicken) -- it is a bit too saucy and sour, in my opinion. It is not bad though. The lunch portion is just right. It also comes with a side soup or salad. I had the salad and it was a basic one. It comes with a peanut sauce.  Summer Roll (all veggie wrap) -- two big veggie rolls 2 types of sauces: a sweet and sour, and a peanut one. I love the peanut sauce. I always get two of those one per roll. :) I also tried the summer roll with chicken; that was really good, too. I ordered this one by itself and I am already stuffed. So if you want to have the summer rolls, make sure you share with someone else or else you won't be able to eat anything else.   Last time I checked in, I had the thai iced tea (I know it is bad; but it is so GOOD!) along with two glasses of the water that is infused with a cucumber slice (makes it extra refreshing) and the Summer Roll with Chicken. Let me tell ya, I didn't wanna move and wanted to go home.   One of last times I was here (I guess I am here a lot), I had the house fried rice. It has chicken and shrimp in it, which is a big YUM! It also has cashews in it. I thought it was weird but it gave the soft rice an extra something. Not bad at all.   Secondly, the service:  Dee and May (hehe, she has the same name as me) are super nice and I've been sitting at the bar more often. Dee told me this is a family owned restaurant and her niece works there. They all speak Thai and it seems like a really cool language.   Food: 4.7 Service wise, my rate is a 5!",

The broth is wonderfully flavorful, without being too salty and there is a really decent amount of veggies in the soup along with the wontons.

    "text": "My husband and I had been on the road since Saturday afternoon and we finally had settled in to our hotel room and Yelped where we wanted to have our first dinner during our stay. Yelp reviews rated this little place as high as the one we had eaten at last time and I was craving me some yellow curry.  We called ahead because its Easter. So with fingers crossed (but understanding if it was closed) we'd hoped they were open.  Oh my! Not only were they open, but the employees were happy. They seated us right away, went over the special, and took the time to answer and inquire of the questions we asked.  We started out with Satay (4 with sauce and a slaw type salad and the cucumbers were delicious) and crab wontons (6 of those don't seem like that many but they are plenty).  Now my husband and I are pretty healthy eaters and I have to say that my eyes were way bigger than my stomach. Unless you are going to share appetizers or make the appetizers your meal, I recommend only getting ONE. We chose the two and continued with the Mussaman for him and for me.... The classic curry... Each with some steamed rice. His must have been pretty tasty as he was able to finish ... Mine ... Fantastic ... But I was so full from the appetizers, I could barely get half done. We boxed it up and I had a yummy snack at the hotel. We hadn't ordered drinks (the water was very refreshing and adding the cucumber slices was amazing) but we did notice they had a nice selection of alcohol. The place only served about 6 tables but I am pretty sure it was because of the holiday. We noticed they also had a drive through. I don't see any reason why this is not a packed house on most nights. The prices very reasonable our ticket was only 45 bucks. Everything was nice and clean and the waitress was very good at letting us know where our order stood.  There is no second chance at the parking lot. If you miss it the first time just simply drive around the block. The entrance is right before the building. The road after is the exit road. Thank you for our Easter Dinner!",

I ordered take out online and the food was ready on time which was great. When i got home, I noticed that my yellow curry was looking kinda bland. the veggies included were undercooked and the rice on the side was actually completely crunchy and uncooked. Gross. I had an order of fried rice as well, so I ended up eating that and mixing in the chicken from the curry dish to make a big mixed dish. That was ok, so I never ended up complaining about the food to SaBai, but I must say that being able to cook rice should probably be something the restaurant has mastered by now - very disappointing. I think I'll try someplace else from now on.",

I give up on this one   It upsets me that they lack attention to detail, with so so quality food and poor value for my money   First time - food was delivered to our office but without our beverage although that was charged.   No sorry no apologies!! I conveniently thought it could be a genuine mistake, so let go!  Second time a take-out order for spicy noodle and all I had was some really hard cooked/caked noodle without any gravy it was so awkward to even eat that. So I requested for some sauce and they charge me for it. OK I thought maybe next time they will be better  Third time it was at the lunch special time. We ordered one chicken dish, one veg dish with soup and salad. I won't complain on this as I was really hungry and ate up everything, somewhere I feel the food tasted good :) But wait! I asked for a Pad Thai noodle to go and requested to substitute veggies instead of eggs and tofu  When I went home I found the same hard noodles with one ring of zucchini one snap peas and that's all as vegetables, and I paid 8 bucks for this.  At that moment I knew I'm not going back here!!!!! Ever!!!! Again!!!!!  SaBai - bye bye!! :( ruled out from my list!! So much for the love for thai food!",

    "text": "Honestly, for the price, I expected a lot more.  I made a delivery order via grubhub, and the turn around was good.  It actually came almost 20 minutes ahead of the estimate.  Lettuce Wraps - 3/5 - The lettuce wraps were actually pretty passable.  My only suggestions would be to add a little starch to the stuffing so that it doesn't water down so much in transport, to make sure the lettuce is dried sufficiently, and to bag the lettuce separately from the hot items for transport.  CoCo Soup - 2/5 - I didn't actually care for it, for me the acidity was a bit much, and the taste of lemongrass was overpowering.  That said, I know a lot of people that would like this.  Sa Bai Fried Rice (chicken and pork) - 1/5 - it was just kind of gross.  Very heavy, very one note, and the meat didn't have a pleasant texture at all.  Pad Thai (chicken & shrimp) - 2/5 - The shrimp was overcooked, and the chicken had the same textural issues that the fried rice had.  Overall, it was flavorful and seasoned well, it just wasn't quite right, this was the only dish that imho was well seasoned despite other flaws..  In general, the pricing is a bit high for the quality... if I'd got portions half the size for half the price I'd be happier.  For that matter, if I got half the portion for 3/4 the price and the food itself was good, I'd be very happy.  In general, it seems like they're trying to make up for lower quality with larger portions.  The pricing itself is a bit high compared to similar restaurants in the area.  The chicken/pork seams like it was braized or steamed instead of grilled or otherwise cooked with a higher heat to create a sear and better flavor.  The texture is bad and is reminiscent of what you'd expect from a catering company, not a higher than average priced thai restaurant.  Most of the dishes had a very one-note flavor and weren't well developed.  These problems could be an issue by not having their best staff on a Thursday night, but it's pretty unforgivable.  As it stands, with tax, delivery fee and tip, the order was well over $60, and I have a lot of leftovers that frankly, I'm not going to eat...  I'd ordered a lot of items as the delivery fee and per-item pricing pushed it up a lot, and I wanted to have leftovers for over the weekend.  Given the poor taste, and high priced, I spent a lot for food that's mostly going into the trash bin.",

Hot, sour, spicy, saltiness...are not there.  I believe the food is fresh made cause it is so hot when it serve on the table but the taste got very disappointed.  The soup is vegetables soup with a lot of grounded pepper (which made it spicy).  The green curry beef, only got 6-7 slices of beef and mix veggies, the curry had very light curry taste to it, barely tastes few drop of coconut milk.  Where are the lemongrass, basil, limes, Thai chili, coconut milk...I can't taste any of that from the food and soup here.  The portion of food is like a kid meal, if you are hungry and looking for Thai food, i won't suggest to go there .  By the way, I like the glass of water with couple of cucumber slices in it, it tastes a bit freshness.",

In the Spicy Fried Noodles  I could not detect the advertised Thai basil, or other flavors, and there were huge chunks of jalapeno complete with seeds instead of the promised poblanos.   The noodles were soggy and had very little in the way of vegetables or protein, just a big huge serving of flabby noodles with no flavor.  I don't think they used any fish sauce, which is a foundation for authentic Thai food.  The lettuce wraps are bland, the chili sauce that comes with them is just sugar sauce, and the peanut sauce is watery.    And way too pricey.  I can make better Thai food at home.  It's really not that difficult if you have the right ingredients and care, even just a little bit.",

Spicy fried rice was not spicy and missing flavor to it as well. Overall, not the best Thai. Definitely would not eat here again unless I was drunk and desperate. A for effort though.",

Whoever took my order, I appreciate you. Not only did you verify my address and make sure you had a gate code, you made sure my order was just like I wanted it. I didn't know the address at my current location and you waited ---patiently. Seriously, some people can just 5star an experience because they are just awesome.

    "text": "I have never yelped...but this restaurant actually made me pick up my tablet and get an account.  I felt that I needed to protect and warn other thai food lovers in the valley. The New Times gave this restaurant the Best Thai food award last year. Apparently the Phoenix New Times reviwer was either a)paid off  b)on extasy c)held at gunpoint when evaluating the cuisine at this establishment.      I don't know where to begin, but first lets start with the objective facts that I am full Thai and also brought along 2 Americans who are very familiar with both Thai food and dining out in general.  Now let the story begin......      The servers were very pleasant and prompt and the establishment  clean and presentable.  When inquiring on what to order our server( also full thai) told me that the special was avocado green curry.  Also she stated that the curry dishes were most definitely \"authentic Thai\", And not some watered down American version.  I was immediately skeptical because there is No such dish made with avocados in thailand.   I opted for the standard chicken green curry.  We also ordered chicken satay and pad prik king with beef.  All are very standard Thai fare and easily available in any Thai restaurant.      The chicken in both the satay and curry tasted (I kid u not) like flavorless cardboard.  Almost like processed frozen chicken planks that had been boiled in water too long and then put in their respective plates.  It was terrible.  The prik king had a total of 5 small beef morsels and the rest of the dish was filled with vegetable filler!  It wasn't nitpicky..... It was blatant!  Both the curry and the prik king were very spicy...but with Jalapenos!!!  At this point it was laughable and downright insulting to any customer that came to eat Thai food.  Thai chiles are readily available anywhere in the valley and are an essential cornerstone of any Thai restaurants armament of ingredients.      I just failed to comprehend how this could happen in a supposed \"reputable\" Thai restaurant.  The Thai owner should be ashamed for such an unabashed slap in the face to her Thai culture.      The ultimate kicker was this however.... When exiting we passed by the kitchen only to see that it was Mexican cooks at the helm!!!!!  wow.. Now it all made sense.... The avocados, the jalapenos, and the Mexican subculture in the kitchen in charge.  maybe this restaurant is going after a whole new cuisine... Thai-Mex fusion!",

After not being able to order online as it told me my house was out of their location, I called in. They said I was in their area, I ordered, and they quoted me 35 minutes. An hour later I called to check on my order and the same woman answered saying it was just leaving and they had a lot of orders..no apologies, no quote of time. I sat and waited 30 more minutes until it finally came to my door. $40 later, I had large servings of cold and soggy spring rolls and two entrees. Definitely disappointed in the lack of customer service and apologies. I have gotten much better Thai delivery for cheaper and will most likely take my business there instead. I understand having lots of orders which is why restaurants usually quote you double the time...I gave my phone number and it is very easy to call and let me know they are running late or are overbooked etc.",

They also have fun Thai trinkets you can buy!",

    "text": "So, yes, this lower Arcadia Thai restaurant is still working out a few glitches but I am confident that they can pull it off with a bit of finesse. First off, the food. It's really good. Fresh, modern and delicious. The last time we went we had lettuce wraps ( the best I've had anywhere) and Thai Beef with Thai Basil/ They split it beautifully for us-enough for 2. I haven't had a bad dish yet. The converted Wendy's is a bit off from the outside but don't let that stop you. It's really cute inside-warm and modern. Problem is they either have the air on too cold, the music too loud and/or the lights turned way too low. All fixable things. The servers are still figuring things out, considering the 3 times we've been there it has been pretty dead. If you like modern Thai food and your tired of Thai Lana...please check this place out-you won't be sorry.",

The inside definitely has a modern look with contemporary furniture and design.  The food is above average.  We ordered Larb Chicken Salad and Pad Thai.  The Larb Chicken Salad had a great tangy flavor, but the Pad Thai was okay.  I think the food was a bit overpriced because I am used to paying half the price for very authentic Thai food.  I guess you could say we paid for the decor and setting.  I might try this place again in the future when the menu expands to more items.",

For food I ordered the CoCo Soup (coconut milk soup) with no meat sub extra veggies and a side of rice.  It was so flavorful, and the soup was just was I was looking for!  My friend was equally pleased with his garlic shrimp dish and side salad.  I can't wait to hit this joint up again when I'm in the mood of tasty Thai cuisine!",

The short ribs I chose were amazing, so tender they fell apart at the touch of the fork, and the avocado chicken curry my wife selected was even better. Hope to make it back before we leave town!",

Obviously, since I ordered a dish with Spicy in the name, I was expecting some heat, but ordering a medium-level spice made for inedible food. Behind the spice, there were odd flavors of sweet and sour, certainly not traditional Thai flavors. With delivery fee and tip, I'm out $40 when only about 10 total bites could be taken.",

(dear owner - if you are reading this please turn up the lights in the bathroom!)  Now, on to the food.... It is not your typical Thai restaurant menu. (ie red/yellow/green curry with choice of protein, etc...)  I started out with an order of the Crispy Thai Rolls. The rolls were crispy, were served with some sweet sauce and some salad garnish with a light dressing. They had a nice flavor but left my fingers somewhat oily.  I continued with an order of the Spicy Fried Noodle with Chicken, and did not specify how hot. It was very well seasoned  and an at appropriate level of spice. It had some zing, but not too much. I enjoyed the dish very much and look forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow.  Overall I enjoyed the food and look forward to going again to try something new. It is a cut above your typical Thai restaurant and the price reflected that, $16 for my two items.",

We also had the mango mousse cake, mousse with spongecake 'crust' , doused with a thin sieved berry sauce--not too sweet.    The service was attentive and friendly.  My manfriend can tolerate chili but is not addicted to it as I am-he hesitated to order our food 'thai hot', but afterward thought that 'hot' was not hot enough.  If you can tolerate even a slight burn, get your food  'thai hot'.    We look foward to trying more of their dishes.",

She also had to apologize because her manager kept asking her to come back to our table and try to get us to buy some more drinks...which we didn't want.  Prices are high for Thai food around here. $16 for curry? Better be the best curry in town... Except it so isn't.  Which brings me to the food. Wife had some sort of seafood soup that was wayyyyy too sweet. She dumped about a half gallon of soy sauce into it trying to balance it out; never got there because it was becoming salty.  I ordered the sweet curry, which was indeed sweet...but way too thin. Like water thin. Had it been reduced by 50% it would have had a lot more flavor and would have actually adhered to the veggies and chicken.  Spice level, when ordered \"Thai hot\" was reasonably spicy, not outrageous and not wimpy like a lot of places.  No chance we'd return, there is just nothing about this place that stands out.",

We started with a steaming pot of Tom yum soup, which was a perfect blend of lime, lemongrass and Thai chili spice with a healthy portion of shrimp.  The hot pot was large enough to serve four for an appetizer.  I ordered the Sabai sweet curry with chicken which was absolutely delicious. The chicken was a little dry but no matter, just dunking it in the delicious and plentiful amount of curry sauce made it perfect.  I took the leftover sauce to go thinking I could make some rice and chicken at home and use the sauce again. My friend ordered the lemongrass pork and eggplant. The bite she would actually share with me was amazing.   The food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen but was well worth the wait. We will definitely be back.",

This restaurant was started by a young local couple and they really seem to know what they are doing. They obviously put their heart into their business and care about the customers.  For dinner, I had the Prik King with chicken. It was incredibly flavorful  and the portion size required me to take some to go. The spice level was exactly where I requested.  For the lunch, I had the Jalapeno curry. This has all the warm comfort of an excellent curry, but it has a fantastic accent of jalapeno with it. The flavors are robust, balanced, and they intrigue throughout the entire meal. Some Thai food is great for the first few bites, but then you want a new flavor because it only has one bold flavor that tends to overwhelm. The  dishes at SaBai are all complex enough to keep your taste buds engaged in the eating process for the entire meal. That is a really strange way of putting it, but it is the best I can do! By the way, my friend had the spicy noodles for her lunch and she loved them.  I will be back and I will try another new dish!",

The bill was $25 total, awesome value and everything tasted great.",

    "text": "Mid-sized restaurant built in what used to be a Wendy's fast food restaurant.. The setting is mildly romantic with dim lighting and candle lit tables and the service is a bit short-handed, but that's alright because they're pretty small in size.. I came here because I had a $25 certificate that could be used with a minimum dining bill of $35 from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a>.. People magazine sent me an offer to get a free $25 voucher to any restaurant participating in the program so I figured it was worth trying.. Dishes run in the $12 range and our appetizer was $8.. I ordered the chicken/pork fried rice and it had eggs, toasted cashews, pineapple, onion, and other things.. My friend ordered the cashew chicken with white rice and we shared a satay chicken appetizer.. One of the things that I really enjoyed was the pickled cucumber that came with our appetizer.. It was so good that I asked for more! It was only meant to be a small side dish to compliment the appetizer but I loved it.. Both of our entrees were delicious and it was so good I didn't even save room for dessert.. I have never tried cashews before but thanks to Sa Bai Modern Thai I am now a fan! If I'm ever in the area again I would definitely return here..",

    "text": "Went there yesterday to have a kind of early dinner with my cousin's gf. This is the first restaurant that I've been to since moving here and it did not disappoint. The decor was really nice, modern and simple. We were greeted by who I think was the manager and a waiter.  we were seated and served water really fast. I thought it was so cute how the water had a slice of  cucumber in it. Anyway we took a look at the menu and we both already knew we wanted the pad thai.  I've had pad thai from plenty of places in California and thought I've had the best, but wow the pad thai at this place was just perfect to me. It had the right amount of spice, sweetness and the noodles were perfect. Not to mention they didn't skimp out on the meat at all. chunks of chicken and 3 big pieces of shrimp. oh man it was good! As for appetizers, I didn't really want anything, but since it was happy hour I believe it was $2 off (don't quote me on that lol) I was sad to see they didn't have fresh shrimp spring rolls on the menu. (shrimp, noodles, cilantro, mint wrapped in rice paper served with peanut sauce) The waiter recommended the vegetable spring roll though. It reminded me of the fried eggrolls you get at chinese food places. pretty good, although nothing spectacular. All in all I loved the pad thai, service and decor. wish they had fresh spring rolls though. would def recommend the place and will go there again and try other stuff from the menu.",

    "text": "Food was okay. Decor rather gloomy. Server was nice but the food was rather slow getting to the table. Price was Mid-range. $8.00 for Papaya salad. Papaya salad had carrots with it and broiled shrimp. As I remembered Papaya salad were only Papaya and dried shrimps. Definetly too much garlics was used on that Papaya salad. This place have potential to be a good restraunt. Need to do something with the decoration and keep the ingrediants ethenic and quit putting carrots in everything!!!",

    "text": "Got to say I am Impressed that although I've been eating the same meal most every visit that the consistency it outstanding.  I have yet to eat a  Meal that didn't have great flavour that wasn't too comlex and overpowering.  Unless I ask for Thai hot.... The flavours meld together well in all the meals I've eaten here so far.  I know that the city is teaming with Thai food places everywhere you look, but Sa Bai is unassuming yet powerful.  Decent wines and bar with some the for the sports fans and such.   So far no issues with servers or anything... Glass always seems filled without me even seeing them fill it.   I go at different hours and different times and have yet to have questionable service.   I can only use my judgement being a foodie and in the culinary feild for years that's it's worth the visit. Yu make even make it your watering hole.   Try the coco soup it good flavourful filling and inexpensive.   And of course the avacado green curry dish is great... Don't forget the THAI TEA. YUM",
