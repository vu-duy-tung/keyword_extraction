I've sat at tables for 15-30 mins without being waited on, bartenders are quite rude, etc. if it weren't for those two issues that I've had so far this place would be fun.   Aside from these issues, I recommend coming here. It's a fun place on Friday and Saturday nights, but other nights it kinda sucks.   Give it a try and see what comes of it. Not every night is the same.",

    "text": "Ok, so I almost didn't go here due to the less than stellar reviews. I was visiting from Texas and had finished up at my work event a tad early and wanted an outside venue to just kind of unwind. From the start the waitress was extremely informative of the happy hour special as well as her/locals favorites. I opted for a margarita that I honestly can't remember the name but it was purple and you have a limit of 3. I quickly figured out why there was a limit. We ordered the queso which was flavorful and plentiful. For my main dish I had wings (by this time I wasn't super hungry). I ordered medium and honey jalapeno. Both were cooked perfectly and had a spicy enough sauce. My boss ordered something that was actually a Mexican dish but quite honestly after my two margaritas I was done listening about how much shr enjoyed her meal. :) I think this is a great place to enjoy drinks and appetizers outside and not melt. Ill come back if I return to AZ.",

Hell, I kinda like Filibertos to hit the spot sometimes, but at least they charge me accordingly. I've had better food at Taco Bell to be honest.  I suppose if you're stuck in Ahwatukee/Chandler and don't want to Lyft it somewhere decent, this place will give you tiny margaritas and you can get your suburban rocks off. That's about all I can recommend, though. I'm pretty sure management counts on your inebriation to rank this place any higher than two stars. Just remember when you're picking the fake beach sand out your hair the next morning: this place is shyte.   Our orders: beef chimi, queso, cheese enchiladas, kids menu, various mixed drinks. Beef chimi was ok, rice and beans standard bland fare. Queso is an embarrassment (personal best: Salty Senorita on a good day; Roaring Fork)  Our service: took too long on a really slow day. We could see food sitting under the heat lamps which turned out to be ours, had to call out service to get it.   That One Redemption: Moscow Mule.",

The food is a weak attempt at Mexican cuisine. The only thing I like eating there are the tacos on Tuesday.   Like many others I think the dress code is ridiculous. Why are guys not allowed to have stickers on their hats? Seems a little silly to me!   The staff is horrible. I almost always see the female servers flirting with the tables that have only men but neglect to check on my table when it's me and my boyfriend. The male servers are no better. One guy even said he would rate my friend and I as 'sevens'. I'm sorry but I don't go out to a bar for the staff to degrade me as a human being. I have no idea who he was or why that comment was even made. But after that I have not enjoyed going there as much.   The only thing I really enjoyed about this place is they sent out coupons for free beer. I loved using the coupon since no purchase was required.",

I've been dying to come here for a long time and honestly I don't know if I can give this an accurate review.  It was 3:00 in the afternoon on a Monday and we were literally the only people inside the place and a few people were trickling in out on the patio.  Happy Hour starts at 3:00 p.m.   Our waitress came over and took our drink and food orders.  Came back with drinks and shortly there after food came out.  Next thing you know, she's coming over and asking if we want our checks or are we going to hang out for a little bit longer?  We all kind of looked at each other and told her we were going to hang out a little longer and we all wanted a round of water.  So off she goes to get our round of water.  We all sat there wondering, does she not want to make more money?  Why would she think we only wanted one drink.  Happy Hour went until 6 or 7 but I guess it was so busy that she needed the table to be turned over.  Will I come back, probably not.  Maybe that's why our waitress works the day shift.  She may not be able to handle the larger crowds.",

I've been satisfied every time. The food is good. All my servers have been friendly. Especially the woman who picks up the plates, if she recognizes you she gives you a warm hug and makes quick small talk in english and spanish.   I was surprised to hear a good DJ. I moved here in September of 2014 from Miami and I've been disappointed at the quality of DJs. However on Tuesday nights the DJ mixes 90s hits with modern house beats. Heard some really good remixes. Saturdays is top 40s with the occasional trap remix. I was surprised they even threw in a merengue for the latin crowd. Given that there's a good sized dance floor I wished the DJ would have focused more on keeping that vibe going more. I feel he played more to the non-dancers which makes sense because they make the bar money. Could be a great dance spot if music was a little better.  Crowd is ok, not upscale, chill mixed crowd. Expect a few cat calls on a weekend from men as you walk through the crowd. Can be annoying but tolerable.   The overall vibe is pretty laid back, ladies you can dress down or rock heals on a weekend and not feel over dressed. Keep in mind some of the outdoor seating in on sand when picking the right shoes.  I don't drink so I can't comment on that, but they do make a yummy virgin pina colada and shirley temple, yes I actually ordered those. You should have seen their faces.   Enjoy!",

The server comes and brings all of our tabs even thou we didn't ask for them.

We decided we were done  with this place again the server was not around so we can ask for our bill. One of the guys in our group asks a security guy standing by us if we get our bill. He was very nice and went and got our bill for us. Then he leaves and I'm like great so who did we give this to since our server wants nothing to do with us.I don't know what her problem was and at that point I just wanted to leave this ridiculous place. So I  went up to bar to pay my bill and was told I couldn't, I have to pay the server! Finally the same security guy comes over and takes our bill. The server finally comes and returns everyone's bill but I paid cash and she didn't bring my change back! So a guy  in our group had to go find her to get my change. Really how do you assure the change is a tip, after all that. Staff at this location needs to go train at the Sandbar at Desert Ridge . I have been there several times and have never had any issues.

But a friend of a friend had a birthday there last weekend during the playoff games, so I went up there.  Although the douchery was still front and center, I was surprised that the food was actually pretty good.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and they weren't half bad.  My friend also ordered them, but got them with the jicama tortillas instead (which is just thinly sliced pieces of jicama).  For those avoiding carbs, it's nice that they offer an alternative to regular tortillas.  As for drinks, my first was the prickly pear margarita -- it was just *bleh* -- not nearly as good as Teakwoods.  But the spicy mango margarita, which I ordered next (and next) was all that and then some!  Love it!  I wish I could get that without having to go to Sandbar, lol.

More amazing is that people pay it! You know you are in Chandler right?   Corona's were $5! of course you are going to have a mexican import beer when you are at a Mexican bar - so they have no pity in the price! No specials on the weekends. Did not eat, but had some chips and salsa. They tasted as expected. Do not expect fantastic mexican food at this place - just something to feed you while you enjoy the decor and expensive drinks.   The service was good and the scene was alot of people hanging out with some Cougars prowling. If they made my wallet feel more welcomed and the food look better, I would visit again.",

Being a lover of Taco's but not a lover of eating a lot of carb loaded tortillas, this new Sandbar has the best option I have ever seen to be able to keep the pleasure of eating a taco with your hands and not just picking at the inside of it with a fork.  They have managed to transform the tortilla into a soft jiacama wrap.  Its delicios and goes very well with their mahi mahi or ahi taco's.  Add in some black beans and guacamole and you have the perfect light and nutritious meal.  I also recommend the pork adovado and basically every other item on the menu has been revamped and has a fresh twist on what was pretty average mexican fare...",

My husband and I were early birds - we arrived at 6pm on a Saturday. The place was not that busy - we chose a pub table by the bar. Our server brought us menus and walked us through all the drink choices, which I love. I decided on the pomegranate margarita and my husband got the Diablo. My drink was extremely sweet and I couldn't taste the tequila. If the entire review were based on my drink, it would get one star. The Diablo, however, was so yummy - a lightly sweet cocktail with a spicy aftertaste - it was so good my husband had two of them.   We ordered four appetizers, which was a lot of food. (1) The steamed mussels in ancho chili sauce were AMAZING - we wanted to lick the plate clean. (2) The calamari was underwhelming - deep fried and rubbery w/ an overly sweet chili sauce. (3) The steak quesadilla was yummy, but they didn't provide enough guacamole, salsa or sour cream for the entire dish - it seemed like there was some serious rationing going on. (4) The coconut prawns were lonesome - four little guys, fried to death, sat on a very large place with more of the same sauce from the calamari.    Our server was over-attentive. She stopped by about every five minutes to see how we were doing. It drove us both a little nuts, but she was really nice, which made up for the constant checks.   Total cost of 1 margarita, 2 diablos, 1 beer and four appetizers: $75. (I think for the cost/value ratio, I am better off across the street at Z' Tejas.)  I feel like this place has the potential to be very great if they could just change up a few things. Don't over-fry things, add some variety to the sauces (maybe chipotle mayo for calamari?), don't ration guacamole and sauces, and don't give me super sweet drinks with a splash of tequila and call it a margarita.",

I did mark that they have waiter service but it is so hit or miss on the level of service that it is questionable.  Maybe it should ask \"effective\" wait service.",

Unfortunately even though I did not want to give the card but was forced to because I felt that there was no other option beside leaving I took it. To make a long story short, I paid my bill cash and a half hour later looked at my credit card account and they ran it for the amount I already paid. Tried to talk to the GM steve and yes I was upset because I like the place, but hate a hustle, smoking mirrors, what ever you call it this day.  We talked and he said he would take care if it in the morning, the problem is that they think it is okay to hold your card for $50 with out getting any authorization or billing it after you paid in cash! Why is it okay for this to happen? As far as I have always know, an establishment can never put a hold on a card with authorization( signature) and then when you call and are upset( which Is a common response) they act like it is you fault. Great place when it comes to the bill, watch your money( or should I say unauthorized holds on your credit cards that they ask for)",

I had lunch here today with a girfriend and thought it would be more crowded in the bar for Sunday football, but it wasn't too packed.  We were hoping to catch up and chat, so the noise level with the music and high def sports made it a little bit challenging, but overall it's a cool atmosphere and has a good vibe.  I ordered the chicken burrito with black beans and rice ($9) and she had the cheese enchiladas with green sauce and rice/beans ($9).  I liked the presentation, both plates were very festive and nicely sized portions.  I ate half of mine and took the rest to go.  It was really good with nice chunks of shredded chicken breast mixed in with a pico de gallo type sauce.  The service was really good, and I'm looking forward to coming back for cocktails :)",

I didn't have any food so I can't really comment on that but the drinks were good and strong. People were very nice. Outside was interesting...never seen sand lots in a bar, but the fact that they have an outside bar as well as inside was great! I was there on a UFC fight night so it got pretty busy as it got closer but the bartender was always very attentive and waitresses came to check on us frequently. I didn't get to stay for this epic loud obnoxious DJ or the other bad things that have been said about night time but it looks like this place could be such a good time!",

I could see one of the managers sitting at the bar drinking. Probably off her shift, but she's there in her spare time?  Seen other of their staff hanging out drinking too.  Maybe it's just me, but it feels awkward to be around that.  It also probably explains why their service sucks, because their employees treat the place as their personal hang out instead of their place of work.  Also, the music was loud and spazzy. I appreciate a good mash-up too, but this stuff was just painful and obnoxious.   My guess is that the only reason this place gets business is because it's the only game in town for the Chandler/Ahwatukee area. I don't know too many people that actually enjoy going here, but it's probably the lesser of two evils (instead of driving to Scottsdale). PLEASE let there be more competition for a good bar/nightclub in this area!",

I've been here a few times for happy hour or just to kick back, but when I celebrated my 28th birthday here last month, I knew that this place deserved a great review. We were able to get two booths and two tables in the upper area seating behind the entrance last minute, and the hostesses and our server were all equally amazing.  Now, if you're looking to hang at a place where you just want to be seen, this isn't the place. It's a relaxed atmosphere and you'll find the occassional snobs and tools (but what place doesn't have those?), but for the most part, it's pretty easy going. Dance floor, bar, water, sand, cabanas - they all add to the environment, but my thought has always been that your insight goes wtih your attitude. That being said, our service from Bree (I think that's her name?) was fantastic! She didn't mind splitting up the checks even though there were about 15 of us, and was always friendly and accommodating! Two thumbs up for her.  Somewhere in the night we ended up ordering food, which wasn't all that great, but the drinks were really good (try the lemon drops!). The music this particular night wasn't completely on point, but we still had fun. It's a place that I'm definitely looking forward to going to again.",

I think it's pretty lame they charge a cover for guys after 10pm and they do have a sign up about a dress code, I've never been with anyone that's had a problem so I'm not sure what they won't allow. I know some of the girls I've seen there are dressed like h00kers, so maybe they just do the general no baggy pants for the fellas? Ha.   After 10 they clear out the tables inside and have dancing. Pretty good music, sometimes its a weird mix and you are scratching your head on how to dance to the next song but still fun. Lots of old school fun songs to sing along to and just have fun. The dance floor doesn't seem to get to packed, not dead by any means - you have room to move around.   Its very diverse, I still think everyone wants to check it out. Age range 21-50, seriously :) Some of the people in there are a little too Scottsdale for Chandler, no offense to those Scottsdale-ites. But seriously, you are at a bar that has a sand floor outside, 6 inch heels may have not been the best choice of footwear.   It's hit and miss with the bar service, at the bar can take awhile to get a drink, but that's going to happen anywhere. I do want to give major props to Katie, our server the other night for taking care of our table. She was awesome and I was never empty handed.",

Normally, the boys pick places like Majerle's and Murphy's Law.  Boorrrring.    Now, I don't really like Sandbar Scottsdale.  Too......\"alternative\", with lots of punk rockers.  But anyway.  We arrived around 4:30pm for happy hour, and there was already a good sized crowd there.  When we sat down with several others, it was clear the waitress was terribly slow with zero personality.  And what's up with the black knee socks with the sculls?  It continued to get busy, and the crowd was the most random group ever.  I saw 21 year olds, parents with children in tow, hot MILF's, and old dorky men straight from Intel.  I'm thinking it's because it's new and everyone wants to check out that cool bar with the real sand and mini pool.  I would have gone with 2 stars, but I threw an extra in because they're new and I will check it out on a Saturday night around 9pm to see if we can weed out some of the randoms and get a fun crowd having a good time!    Who am I kidding?  We just talk amongst ourselves anyway!",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times and this was my first time eating from their menu, boy was I disappointed. Yes, the atmosphere outside is unique but the menu fails in comparison. Never once have I ordered a salad and had to request extra lettuce, but I can now check that off the list. I ordered the taco salad expecting a standard offering most would get by ordering the same thing at a Mexican restaurant. I asked for no cheese or sour cream as I am lactose intolerant and yet it showed up topped with both. They took it back and brought back a dairy free version for me but I was shocked at what came out. It was basically a large plate of black beans accompanied by three large (but fragile) tortilla chips, topped with average tasting grilled chicken and sprinkled wit shredded lettuce and tomato. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that the taco plate my husband ordered had the same amount of lettuce as an optional topping that my salad did all together. So, I got some stink eyes when I requested a side of lettuce and was brought a plate of more tiny shredded lettuce. Not exactly the salad I was hoping for when I ordered it. To top it off my margarita was watered down and our waitress seemed more concerned with chatting with her friends at the bar than actually checking on us when we needed things, you know like sweeteners for ice tea that had to be requested twice rather than being brought with the drink initially. Needless to say, we weren't thrilled with our experience and doubt we'll be returning unless it's for some large group gathering where we clearly didn't have a say in the venue selection.",

I could see her chatting with her friends. My mom let her know we were ready for the check when she passed her on the way to the restroom. She continued to talk to her server friends so I finally had to walk up and just give her my card.   All in all, it was a pretty good experience except for the last part.",

Kind of a care free, fun atmosphere. Great to go have a drink and relax. Food, however, was mediocre at best. Had the soft taco combo and chose 3 unique tacos that sounded delicious.  None of them were delicious; all kind of bland. Wouldn't go back for food but might go back for a drink or two on the patio after I ate somewhere else",

The drinks are weak, I got the prickly pear margarita and it tasted like straight up juice. I told my server and she said that it was mostly juice and I should have known that before I ordered it. Umm no, that's not how it's described on the menu. Also, the carnitas tacos had no flavor and were filled with fat.......yuck. Once again I alerted my server that the carnitas were mostly fat. Again she says that's how they are made. No apology, no attempt to make it right or ask if I'd like anything else. So my first and only impression of this place is; weaker then most drinks, crappy service, and low quality food. So will I be back..........most definitely not.",

My friends and I have been going here every Tuesday until when trying to play a game a customer told me that it was their game and that no one could play it.  Thinking it was a joke I tried playing as the person got physical with me.  After asking to speak with management the server said she would rather not.  When I finally saw the manager I introduced myself and the incident.  At this point the manager then laughed in my face.  After trying another the game the same customer then once again interfered and got physical with me.  The manager was watching the entire second incident.   Then after the manager actually came to my table and told me it was very childish of my to even say anything to him and it was something a person in preschool would do.  We left immediately and will mot be returning anytime this management is working.  Over the past few years we watched the service go down hill as well im guessing this is also due to management.  A couple of weeks ago our server was teaining a new server.  Long story short the server never put our orders in left our table mid meal with no drink service and sat down with the other server to eat.  Never got our food, had to order all drinks at bar, and got overcharged.  No thanks Sand Bar will be looking into a new spot!",

    "text": "I am not sure if I'll ever go back to this location. Starting from the front, we were greeted by 3 hostess and they seemed a little lost on where to sit us. I mentioned I am expecting 1 other person so show up so we were seated at a 3 bar stool table. The waitress (Laura) did greet us right way and was on point with our 1 round of water. I mistakenly left my ID at home, my mom was on her way with my wallet but we ended up canceling with her because of this service. We were asked to move to a different table because they were in process of swapping out one of the TVs, the manager did comp a round of drinks for us. I could never get the comp drink and the waitress mentioned I could come back and claim that drink if I have my ID. She was so sassy about it the entire time.  A large family group with babies showed up and her attention was on them ONLY. She would bring them refills, get their drinks, admiring their children, etc etc. We were finally able to order food, she took the order and left for a very long time. The guys brought our food and seemed pretty polite on helping clear the table for us and getting our plates arranged, koodos. My boyfriend was able to order his first beer, we had to wave her down to put in an order for his 2nd beer. At this point we were not having it with her attitude.  The food... I really was not a fan of any of it. We had the beef tacos, a burger with fries, and taquitos. The beef didn't taste right and seemed a little too dry, the fries were mixed with sweet potato fries? Gross. The tacos, I only could eat 1 and didn't care much for the taste of this beef. The beans and rice were pretty simple, nothing special... yeah we didn't bother eating much of it after eating the burger and taco.  Right about now, I was not happy the waitress was still being horrible to us and we had to wave her down again to bring a box for us. Once she dropped off the box I had to ask her for the check and she had the nerve to flip her hair at me, \"Sure, I'll be right back\". I was ready to give her my card and had a question about the bill and she just looked at me and walked off. She ran to the kitchen and never came back, I had to ask one of the other waitresses to cash us out, denied. Laura finally comes back and I had to follow up to get my card swiped. I asked about the comp drinks and she has the nerve to tell us that we drank 3 beers while we were there and said she brought them to us... HELLO! I had no ID so I never got it, still being horrible with her attitude. I just took the check and left no tip. I wanted to report this to the manager at the time but he was no where to be found. I am sorry but I am really not seeing myself going back, maybe for a slow beer but that's about it.  We left and soon after, the both of us started to feel sick, we cancelled the rest of our night and had to make a run to CVS. The food we took ended up in the trash. This is not worth $34.60.",

I could totally see myself starting happy our here and relaxing for a while. Would also be good for some Sunday morning drinking. -  decent happy hour menu with cheap appetizers and cheap well drinks - a million tvs ( if you're in to that sort of thing) - decent selection of bottled beers and a wide range of liquor (which is what I'm in to)  Things that make this place a 3 starer vs a 4 or 5: - service is suspect at best. They would have gotten a ton more money out of us if they had been on top of the drinking situation. We definitely would have ordered more if the waitress had checked on us more often - the food is nothing special. Typical bar appetizers and the entrees are just..... Ok. Better tacks have definitely been had and for a better price. Ration of cost and quantity is a bit off. - The DJ. The kid looked to be 13 and was REALLY hooked on playing the Biebs a little too much and a little too loud.  Conclusion? I'd chill out on the patio for a couple of drinks but wouldn't waste my money eating here. I'm a sucker for an awesome patio.",

Like many sports bars in the area the wait staff seems to be more about being a hot chick than a great server, but when the food comes quickly and the drinks don't run dry there's not much room for complaint. The burritos are good and pretty standard for a chain. The salads are really good and very big. If you're watching what you eat then go for one of them and you'll leave full and satisfied.

    "text": "First Yelp review because best service on my worst night.   I just want to start this review off by saying I was probably having the worst day of my life. The kind of day where you wander around aimlessly and don't want to really interact with anyone you know, or anyone in general (and I'm a pretty social person).  The second thing you should know is this is the first Yelp review I have ever written (I've always meant to, I use yelp to decide if a place is good or not). I eat out a lot. almost exclusively. It's not that I'm too lazy to cook, I just have better things to do -  I'll leave the cooking to the pros. So anyway, this review is important to me.  I was out riding to go to a place to eat when I saw that the sand bar was busy. I'd been here once before for a work thing on taco Tuesday and remembered that their tacos were good.  I walked around looking for a good place to sit, I wanted a table to myself so I could do some paperwork and not think about things, but I ended up at the corner of the bar. The guy behind the bar saw me very quickly, something that is actually quite unusual anymore. He got me a drink and introduced himself so fast that I was impressed.  Later on some really drunk guys were trying to talk to me constantly, which is fine (I'm a guy) but one guy started getting inappropriate and touchy feely. The bartender(s) promptly got him a cab and took care of me, seeing that I really didn't want to be bothered.   Another thing is that I really enjoy Moscow Mules and they were made really well, all 3 of them, by the bartender. She was great.  Anyway, too many words. First Yelp review because best service on my worst night. That about sums it up. I'm going to copy and paste that and put it in the beginning actually.  Also the food was good.",

However the mini pool is apparently used for nothing, so it's fun to guess what you can do with it. There is misters so you do stay cool. The Chandler location is beautiful, I've always liked that side of town, very green and nice!    It consists of two very large bars with a huge variety, I can see a lot of bros and brosettes going there.   Our waitress was very nice and helpful, she checked on us often. I ordered the cheese enchilada. It was okay, wasn't the best, but wasn't horrible. However my friend got the nachos and she just did not like them, so don't order the nachos!

It takes the hostess 15 min to seat us as she is so busy flaunting her A$$ in some servers direction who OBVIOUSLY is NOT interested as he keeps looking away and walking off in another direction....ok ok, so we finally get seated. It now takes our server 10 min to actually come over and take our drink order. Another 10 min to bring it <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fback.It&s=ac0348c3be4c1b835dff1572bbf4656c71b42f00cdd2dca4cde3f2b3e76a4291\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">back.It</a> proceeds like this until we actually were begging for our check to pay and get the heck out...reminder there are only 4 people in the entire place... the food was awful, the drinks sucked hard, and the services was BOGUS....  2nd experience.....AHWATUKEE COUGARS. Need I say more. Absolutely AWFUL...I wanted to bludgeon my eyes out and run screaming into the road.   I feel sorry for the local 21 and up's trying to have fun getting humped by the cougars. EEEEWWWWWWW.....I will never go back.",

Didn't expect Arizona to have such a huge Iowa following so I kinda chuckled. It was a good atmosphere though, a sea of black and yellow with everyone having a good time.   We sat inside because the outside was packed. Ended up ordering the Mini Chimis along with some Crown and Cokes. Great spot overall, with plenty of screens to watch the game and great service.",

My friends claimed a table by the time we showed up, one with a perfect view of the small dance floor.  I highly recommend staking out a spot there--it's quite entertaining to watch inebriated individuals shake it like there's no tomorrow. The music is decent; pretty standard for a bar.   The service is fast and the bartenders are friendly. The waitress was very attentive and consistently refilled my diet coke.  Our shots arrived in record time.   Did I mention there's sand by the outside bar?  Just don't take off your shoes; I cringe when I think of the lurking shards of glass from an accidental broken bottle.",

    "text": "It's a bar. There's some sand. Some waitresses are more concerned about their looks than their customer service skills. It's just a typical, average, North Scottsdale bar.  The location is highly convenient, and there's never a line to get in. Even when this place is packed, it doesn't feel that packed. They have ample room inside and out so you never feel squished. It's usually pretty easy to find a table but it's definitely not as easy to find a waitress/waiter that wants to serve you, especially when it gets crowded. During one of our many Sandbar visits, our waitress was so MIA that one of the security guards started acting as our waiter... It was pretty funny to say the least.     When I used to live up in N. Scottsdale, Matt and I would come here for NFL Sunday football all the time. They were also pretty accommodating when it came to changing the channel so that each of us could watch our favorite teams. I always requested the 49ers, and Matt needed to see his SeaChickens. They would even change the channel for our friend, a die-hard Buffalo Bills fan (yes, they still exist), without thinking twice. I truly appreciate a bar that accommodates fans of different teams outside of the one that happens to be playing the Cardinals that week.  This is also a fun place for Happy Hour Mon-Fri. They have great specials, and the drinks get the job done. As far as bar food goes, Sanbar's menu isn't amazing but it isn't horrific either. There have been may times when I've made a meal out of their bottomless bucket of chips and salsa. As far as the crowd goes, it's kinda random. You'll see groups of coworkers enjoying some after work brews, lots of out-of-towners, young 20-somethings getting their drink on, old creepy guys with fake tans. But for the most part, this place turns into a party scene at night. Although I am totally not a UFC fan at all, Sandbar hosts a lot of UFC nights where they put the game on the big screen projector TV, and people can reserve seats/tables in advance... just as an FYI for all of you UFC people out there.   I know what to expect from Sandbar, and it's an A-OK place in my book. I'd recommend it to anyone in N. Scottsdale looking for a fun, reasonably priced bar for happy hour or a night out. However, this just isn't a bar that I would drive out of my way to get to.",

The atmosphere is pretty festive and entertaining.  The crowds on Fri and Sat nights tend to get a little too big for my liking, but it can still be a good time.  I prefer to go during the week when its a little more mellow but still enough people to make it lively.    The food isn't traditional mexican by any means, but still not bad.  I really enjoyed the jalapeno mac n cheese.  The drinks are decently priced, the mixed drinks can tend to get a little pricey so I usually stick with beer.  Wish they had drink specials on Fri and Sat nights, but most of their specials are during the week.    Overall, I enjoy this place.  Its close to my home and the atmosphere makes up for the other minor inconveniences.  I've read other negative reviews about the staff, but personally have never run into anything that was too big of a deal.  The proximity and familiarity with the place is why I enjoy it like I do.",

The game had just started and we got the last table outside(there was nothing open, even a bar stool on the inside). I haven't been here at night but at least during the day it's pretty chill.   They play the game when it's on and not music like other places. The food was actually pretty good. The portions were large which were expected. We tried the bbq ribs which were really good and I had mahi tacos. The boy had carne tacos which were also really good but the bbq ribs were the best.  Overall the service was great - drinks were never empty and the outside bar loaded with TVs was impressive. It's a high contender against out other fav's for weekend football for sure. Definitely a younger crowd but they're old enough to not be d*bags.",

They have a heavy pour on their drinks which is great when you're drinking Knob Creek, however they need a little work on their mix drinks the Mojitos were just bad.

Going off topic, back to the review, The selection is decent on their menu, I wasn't a big fan of the rice and beans, Both were lacking in this cuisine.  The icead tea was good and filled up often, I was never a big fan of Kenny Loggins, This is the first time that I've been here, Didn't even have time to order a beer.

Wow.  Of course the rest of the experience wasn't quite so great but whatever.  The Sandbar obviously caters to a young party crowd at night, there are outdoor couches and a huge bar both outside and in.  A free beer coupon from the Marriott I was staying in gave us a great start!  I expected to have great Mexican in Phoenix for obvious reasons, but this ain't the place to get it.  The dishes were an American and typical interpretation of Mexican.  Nachos loaded with so much crap on top that you could make a meal out of them alone.  I tried the sliders with sweet potato fries, they were passable, but not real Mexican either.  The bartender was extraordinarily friendly in a genuine way, not the forced corporate way which I hate.  (you know the type: and how are we doing today, sir?) Anyways, he was a cool guy.  I wouldn't eat here again, it was average, but I would gladly party later at night.",

We went back a few times, and there were certainly some other nice tacos on the menu, but they weren't always consistent.  I stopped eating here when, one day, the waiter brought me an extra taco I didn't order (none of the five other people at the table recalled it, either).  I mentioned to him that I only ordered three tacos, and his response was, \"It's OK, they're only $2.\"  Great point, sir: you see, your tip was going to be $2.  I guess it all works out! (Honestly, I would have still tipped had his response been something remotely resembling an apology.)  Seriously, though, that was the first time I was ever expected to pay for something I did not order.  For some reason, we decided to go back again this week to see if they still had the crawfish tacos for Mardi Gras... And they did!  Unfortunately, they were not $2 like the other tacos.  Even worse, they didn't mention that they were actually shrimp tacos with a few pieces of crawfish in them.    Sorry, Sandbar, but this behavior is NOT OK.  If you're going to advertise something as crawfish tacos, it sure as hell had better not be shrimp tacos with a few sparsely placed pieces of crawfish.  I don't want to pay $4 for twelve crawfish (our waitress who neglected to mention that the crawfish tacos are not crawfish tacos did get a tip, but it was the bare minimum for her bad service, which was not just limited to the taco information).  Besides the deceit in regards to the menu items, the service here is consistently bad.  Don't expect to have a drink in front of you for more than 50% of your meal.  Fool me once...",

Setup of the dance floor, open air themed, huge outdoor patio and the guy cooking the fresh carne on the side.   There is tons and tons of bar space around here so it's fairly easy to grab a drink, plus waitresses are always walking around trying to get people to do a crazy shot.   The last time we went I was able to tweet the DJ and all the recent tweets shows up on all the TVs around the bar so I could see my drunken shout outs to my girl. The DJ ended up following me on Twitter after that night and even tweeted me asking about a place I checked into on Yelp the following week, so bonus points for having an interactive DJ.  There are not a lot of other options on this side of town. The last night we went here we were bouncing around the SE Valley then after Sandbar we drove to Mill. Though Sandbar is perfectly fine for closing the bar down, just get in line a little early for those yummy street tacos because a drunk hungry crowd will ensure you never get one for yourself!   Protip: Get in line before closing time for those tacos. You'll want one after smelling them all night!",

This is a hard review for me to write because I have lived near this location for a long time and have spent many Friday and Saturday nights there simply for the night life and in all the years have never actually tried their cuisine until recently.   So in order to pay it proper tribute I will separate the two and rate it accordingly.    When it comes to a good time on any given weekend this place gets 5 stars from me. Now don't get me wrong it's probably not for everyone but for me it is a great eclectic spot with a good combination of outdoor and indoor areas. Along with a dance floor if you would be so inclined to shake those hips or an occasional grind. This is one of those places where you can find a mix of a younger and older crowd.   Now.... the food. This is where I would give it 3 stars. It's simply mediocre. It's Mexican but not very tasty. Let's put it this way after a bunch of drinks it is good drunk food and a decent way to end the night and prevent that hangover the next day.   With the liveliness receiving 5 stars and food 3 I am giving Sandbar a solid 4 stars. I will continue to go there for years to come.",

This place does a good job with happy hour and the many drinks and many different tacos.  I've never taken a chance on their $12, $13 burgers partly because they seem over priced to me.",

The waitress asked to hold my husband's credit card since the bar was becoming crowded. He paid cash for his food and drinks at which time the waitress returned a credit card to my husband belonging to someone else and she was unconcerned with locating my husband's credit card. The manager intervened and questioned the waitress regarding my husband's lost credit card, the waitress became combative and stated she was busy. Ultimately, the manager did not locate my husband's credit card and the waitress transacted someone else's purchase on my husband credit card. He immediately cancelled his card. The manager said he would follow up with a call to my husband which never happened. I would never, never recommend anyone to visit this establishment. The staff appears extremely incompetent and should not entertain large groups because they are incapable of tracking their customer's transactions. We are extremely upset and disappointed.",

If I go with my husband and sit at the bar.....the bartenders don't ever talk to us. I don't get it. Only one time was there a male bartender who was cool as sh*t and we looked forward to him. But everyone else....they talk to each other. I told my husband it feels like a strip club....like I need to wave $100 to get some attention. LOL. They are nice though. Never met rude people, just a little snotty maybe. I just don't understand bartenders that don't take time to talk to the people sitting at their bar. Not even an attempt to try to make conversation. We've been going every now and then for a few years trying it again and again and again. Always the same result. It sucks because we really like it there.",

My husband and I had looked this place up prior and decided we would try it out for our date night.  We noticed the place was hopping and were looking forward to some good food.  We walked in and the gals at the front said we could seat ourselves on the patio.  First come, first served.  We choose this option because it was a beautiful night.  It was really crowded, so we thought it would be great.  We found a table back by the cabanas and sat down.  5 minutes passed.  10 minutes passed.  15 minutes passed.  20 minutes later, and still not even a glass of water.  We didn't get acknowledged by any member of the staff at all.  Not one single server.  We watched other people come in and sit down.  They were a large group and they sat at the tables right next to us.  Less than 2 minutes later, a server goes right up to them.  At this point we got up and walked out.  I made sure that the gal at the front knew I was pissed.  She was speechless as we were leaving.  This establishment made it perfectly clear that they did not want our business.  All they were looking for was a group of 20 somethings that would drink a lot and tip good.  We will NEVER return to any Sandbar location in the valley.  We went to a different Mexican spot closer to our house and spent our money there instead.  Happy customers are always great for business.  Unhappy customers tell everyone they know.  Keep that in mind the next time you see someone come in to your restaurant.  Good luck in the future.",

Keep in mind about 5 different servers walked past us, without saying a thing. I finally asked one of the hosts if our table had a server. She confirmed we did and went to check on him, but still nothing. We ended up moving ourselves to the bar after another ten minutes and were greeted right away!

    "text": "I came for my friends birthday. A few of us were sitting at 3 different tables near each other.  My friend was sitting by herself nearest to one of the cabanas by the entrance. A big group of people came in for the Iowa game. The gm named Stephen Howard came up to them and said their cabana wasn't ready yet and basically offered them the table my friend was already sitting at. He told her the table was reserved and she would have to move. We were all confused because that table definitely didn't have a reservation sign on it. He removed all her food from the table and said she can sit at another table. She said she will not be sitting at another table and the general manager proceeded to act like a jerk towards her. We asked for the name of his boss and he was so rude about it grabbing out his phone and told us the name of his boss was Jeff O'Neil and we could go ahead and \"put the number in our phones if we want\" Then when my friends did not back down he finally calmed down and he explained that their TV guy was supposed to be here in the morning to set up the TVs in the cabana and just got there so he needed to seat those people for the Iowa game until the TV guy was done which should take like 20 more minutes then we could have the table back. Which is still no excuse for kicking someone off a table that they were rightfully sitting at but at least he finally explained. It was just a frustrating situation on my friends Bday no less. We all felt extremely uncomfortable after we were having a great time. On top of having to pay 10 dollars to watch the fight when a majority of the TVs only showed the Iowa game all night. The waitress we had was great and checked on us all night. But I have been coming to sandbar for years and will never be coming back if that's how the general manager is going to treat people.",

Overall, we were fairly impressed with the food. It is the service that left us unimpressed. The girl behind the bar was more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  I had to flag her down, first, to get a menu, and then to order, and then to get a refill on my empty ice tea. After I asked her for an ice tea refill, she then actually went back over to the guy she was talking to and actually finished her story - before getting the refill.  She tried to force a couple smiles to save things once she knew we were not happy with her service, but mostly acted like she wanted no part of being there. We were finished, and then waited at least 10 minutes for her finally to ask if we needed our ticket. Then she gave us the wrong ticket.... These type of people do not belong as the main bartender - they can definitely ruin your business.  Tacos and 2 ice teas with tip (which honestly she did not deserve) was $40.

    "text": "Was looking for a Mexican restaurant in the Ahwatukee area and was lured in by the big outdoor patio at Sandbar. I was with family visiting from out of town so I thought they'd like to sit outside and enjoy the warm weather. Unfortunately there were no open tables outside so we ended up sitting inside oh well.  The atmosphere is kinda loud and bar like which was fine. It wasn't so loud that we couldn't hear each other. Although the waiter had a hard time hearing us as we had to repeat ourselves several times. And he always seemed to big in a big hurry which was kinda weird.  We got chips and salsa and a couple people in our party got margaritas to start with. I was kinda bummed that the chips and salsa were $5 when they're usually free at other places if you order dinner. But the salsa was actually pretty good so it was fine.  I had the carnitas tacos and was a bit underwhelmed. Honestly the carnitas at Chipotle is better. They were fine, 3 to an order but the portions were kinda skimpy. The tortillas were fresh though. I ordered it with rice and beans. The beans were fine but the rice was pretty gross. I don't know if it was the seasoning or what but it was some of the worst mexican rice I've ever had.  The boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas and he said they were not good. He said the sauce on them was more like marinara sauce than enchilada sauce - yuck.   My cousin and her husband didn't say anything so they might have liked it or they were just being polite.  With so many other good places for Mexican here in town I don't think we'll revisit Sandbar anytime soon.",

I had a pomegranite margarita.  Too sweet and cheap tasting.  But I guess that's kinda expected at a white-Mexican place (Before you get all offended, I'm white-Mexican, so calm down hehe). Chips and cheese dip were horrible.  Tasted like chemicals or something and the chips were stale and overly salty.  And since when are there mushrooms in \"queso dip\"?  Weird. I heard this was \"the place to be\", hence standing room only. Not very clean.  On the positive side:   Pretty diverse Okay music from the little I could hear above the general noise of the place Big screens (ESPN) to stare at if you so choose A couple hot bartenders This is \"the place to be\" in the area, so if you really care about that, head on over",

The only thing that saved the poor waitress was that it was her first day and it was very busy nonetheless. However, if it's your first day, why are you not writing down orders? We had to wait 30 minutes for drinks, I was completely ignored at first. Then, we received the wrong appetizers and meals, as well as not being checked on more frequently. I understand that it was her first shift so I'm not upset with her but more so with her training or lack thereof. She stayed super upbeat and positive the entire time and once we showed that we understood why she was so flustered she actually got more comfortable. But still, who trains staff to not write down orders while I'm SURE newbies are still learning the menu? Regardless, the food was still great. Shrimp ceviche I highly recommend as well as the Ahi Salad.",

Although that was the highlight of that night, it was also our cue to leave. Another time I went here you could tweet the DJ to play a request, my bf got a song played and it was exciting but then they went back to playing annoying house music and drove me off the dancefloor. I would recommend if you're in the area but I always end up leaving and going somewhere else.",

    "text": "I noticed months ago that construction crews were working on the structure formerly known as Bahama Breeze. Note: I didn't shed a tear when Bahama Breeze shut down, like, a year ago. I'm not generally a fan of chain restaurants (other than Jenny's), and the Breeze to me was nothing more than a glorified Applebee's with a pseudo-tropical theme. Whatev.   So what was this new establishment going to be? A Walgreens? CVS? Fresh&Easy? A strip club? (Dear lord, PLEASE let it be a strip club. I'm begging you. It's a good 40-minute drive back home to Ahwatukee from most of the other fine establishments, and I've found that the longer the commute, the harder it is to get that stripper smell out of my car.)  Much to my chagrin, the joint reopened last week - not as a gentlemen's club - but as the second coming of Bahama Breeze: Sandbar. That was my impression as I pulled into the parking lot ... that I had waited all this time and the place reopened as a smaller version of itself.  But in fact, Sandbar is different. Than Applebee's, I mean. Turns out it's like a cross between Salty Senorita and Dos Gringos. (Sandbar also has locations in Peoria and Scottsdale, neither of which I've been to nor did I know exist.)  The digs are pretty cool, actually. Mexican beach theme with several overhead doors that bring the outside in. In fact, the outside bar area is surrounded by sand. Actual sand. Hence the name. Sandbar. Even though I got sand in my Pumas, I decided it was a pretty cool touch. Ladies ... you might not want to wear high heels, however. Continuing with the theme, they have cabanas and a little beach/wading pool thing that I guarantee drunk people will end up in on many nights, even though it's supposed to be just for looks.  I had the Famous Sandbar Chimichanga, (made famous, apparently, by the other two locations, as this one has only been open for eight days), and it was really good. I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to me that often times, restaurants that put so much effort into their theme have food that's just \"eh.\" The chimi is all I had, so I've nothing else to report culinarily; just know that it was tasty.  Thirty-some-odd flatscreens scattered about the place. Looks like it could be a good place to watch the game on Sundays.  The service was just okay. I'll give Sandbar a mulligan on that, seeing as how it's their first week in operation and I imagine they're just trying to get their feet under them. But it better rock next time.   It's been said - and it's entirely True - that the place doesn't make the place, the people make the place. So ultimately, that will decide whether or not I frequent Sandbar. Too soon to get a feel for the vibe here. There was a whole range of folks patronizing the place on this evening, probably trying to figure out for themselves what kinda' scene it's gonna be. From seemingly normal cool people, to the \"Did we get lost? I thought we were on Mill Ave\" crowd, to the \"Does my Affliction shirt fit tight enough?\" crowd, to the \"They say 60 is the new 25, right?\" crowd ... they were all here on this evening.  Eww. But again, a mulligan because the place is new. We'll see ...  Still have sand in my Pumas. Three stars for now.",

Today I had such a horrible experience that I feel obligated to provide feedback. First, we were seated promptly however the waitress did not provide a lunch menu. I asked for a water, my coworker ordered a margarita (5.00 special). It literally took out server Haylee more than 20 min to get our drinks. When she returned we still hadn't been provided a lunch menu. I then took it upon myself to grab one from the bar. Next, we waited another 15 minutes to get our food order placed. Please be advised that the restaurant only had a hand full of patrons at the time. Last, my order was wrong so I had to wait another 15 minutes for this to be corrected.  Haylee never checked in nor did she offer to refuel my empty glass. Overall, very poor experience. Hopefully this situation gets addressed otherwise we will not be coming back.",

I come here about 4 times a month (happy hour is fun, ladies night is a great deal, and I also came after the rugged maniac this year).  Rugged maniac day was a mess= there was some confusion about what time racers would arrive- but whatever they gave us specials and that's that.   Last Tuesday, a friend and I came for Taco Tuesday and I can be patient when places are packed, people are new, etc. It took our server 13 minutes to greet us, whatever I was in good company and we had lots to chat about. She brought us a slightly incorrect order, again not a huge deal but my drink came 6 minutes after my friends- that was weird. We ordered tacos as appetizers, another round of drinks, all took another hour. Finally- we order food and she comes back 24 minutes later (yes I timed it) and says \"Sorry the kitchen is closed\"...hm....as in it just closed or does she mean it's closed now? Took another half out to get our tab.  We were there for exactly 3 hours (from 7:00pm until 8:59pm according to our receipt)...not because we wanted to be there for that long, but because that's out crappy our server was.",

Most of them are on tall wood stools without backs.  Some of the tables are on concrete and some are on the sand.    Then, there was the menu.  It's really different.  There really is a variety but we didn't think the menu was enough to call it a Mexican grill and that's what we were looking for ... Mexican food.    The red sauce on the enchiladas was pretty spicy and tasted a little burnt.  The pulled pork sandwich was also pretty spicy and nothing on the menu indicated that it was spicy. I can definitely tell you it was.  We were actually quite disappointed with the food and there's no reason we would return.",

The only real complaint we had is that they kept turning of the misters to the cabanas making it unbearably hot. The misters stayed on the rest of the patio, just not the area where people paid extra to sit, which just seemed wrong to me.",

The outside bar has multi-level of tvs..though some hidden under bar roof hindering viewing, but still lots of tvs. We were there opening of March Madness.   Our waitress was great. They use expeditors...another waitress was not, I mean a Bitch to her expeditor. Of course these waitresses are probably 21-23, cute skinny, the poor expeditor was same age, super nice to his tables but not the \"perfect\" 10 & overweight. I was so annoyed & sad & wanted to complain but it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I hope the mgmt does some training with these girls, people see things that they might not think gets seen & doesn't leave a good impression.",

I will say a lot of married couples, it seems like a lot of local people that probably grew up here, from talking to some of the fellow African Americans that were there, a lot of them seem like they go to the community college they were young they're younger folk probably under 30. but yeah you'll see a lot of couples you'll see a lot of younger ish folk that have decided to live out in the Gilbert Chandler area rather than the more metro areas such as Phoenix and Scottsdale I'll be in I'll even throw Tempe in there for some of the University kids busy area. But us employers actually kind of cool I like the layout, I like the music at least on Saturdays, and it had a nice nice little bible I could have the popping of bottles going on and I had kind of a mix crowd a lot of Hispanics you know for Phoenix a good amount of African-Americans and, of course she only while we're in Arizona so you know you'll get your white folk to wish has all the merry bunch of the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frainbow.in&s=06f7a6f3380a2842e67c2f5a36b1e2a854d70c02137a6a8734100fa32b0d28cc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rainbow.in</a> summary next time that I find myself all the way out there I actually would definitely go back to Sandbar it's definitely on my list now if places worth going to if I'm in Gilbert and I don't feel like going to downtown Gilbert and going to Oso or something so my recommendation check it out and if your if you have a group man try out their bottle service it's kind of dope they give you quite a lot of space you know you can fit a good amount of people in there and it's it's worth $2 around especially if you are if you've ever wanted to try it out and you don't got the bread for Phoenix or Scottsdale you can definitely do it in Gilbert",

Had to search for it among the peppers. The server was slow and barely checked on us. We didn't eat the salad and instead opted to just take it home for later. They served the salad with absolutely no dressing. So we had her make sure we had dressing to go. About 4 hours after being home. I wanted to eat the salad and as I was eating it, I was chewing harder than I should have been, on something that I initially thought was burnt chicken. Nope it wasn't chicken- it was like some type of mulch or something with the texture of chewing wood!!! As I take the salad in the kitchen to see what the hell I have been chewing on (better lighting) I see a freaking flying bug and the shit I spit out because I couldn't chew it down. Look at the picture!! I'm so disgusted. They were definitely not the same place I remember.",

We flagged several employees and they said they would go to our server and let him know. We ended up taking to several people and would get items served every 30 mins. They messed up some drink orders and served the food with no utensils. Our food was cold by the time we got silverware which we had to bug a bus boy. Completely unacceptable and I'm going to disputed the charge with my bank that's how bad this experience was.",

Food and service are after thoughts here. Perhaps it's not this way on other nights, but the Sandbar was pure hookup joint while I was there. Target M-effin Rich baby, beyond anything I have ever experienced. If you are single and looking, suit up and head over. But you better be prepared. Folks were leaving 2-by-2, like there was an Ark in the parking lot.  I was just shaking my head the whole time. Happily married, alcohol-dry... this was not my element fo sho.  From a purely sociological point of view, the Earth could have been repopulated from this restaurant alone, and in short order. Holy Moley! There was something or someone for everyone.  Entrepreneurial ideas were rampant in my head. How much money could I make if I park an Airstream RV in the parking lot, and rent it 30 minutes at a time. Can I partition the RV 3 or 4 times to maximize the transactions per hour? How many personnel do I need for rapid turnover and quality/hygiene? What're the sheet, bleach, and Lysol consumption rates? Maybe I rent 25 minutes at a time. It's amazing that beautiful woman can't pry her eyes from that guy's crotch. What planet am I on? No, thank you, I'm with these knuckleheads.  Truly, these are the crazy things that run through a married man's head in a situation such as this. Was there food? Sure. They were grilling carne and pollo asado and it smelled damn good but my baby sitting responsibilities did not afford me the opportunity to try it.    Don't believe me? Check it out.",

Now I myself am happy to drink draft beer but my wife is hard core on Coors Light bottles.  Not sure what I am going to do but you would think if you changed a policy at the restaurant that you would also change the web site.  Hoping they change it back to the way it used to be.

Would i recommend Sandbar? Does Dolly Parton sleep on her stomach? Is the Pope Jewish? No. the answer is just no. TERRIBLE place.",

    "text": "ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE !!!! This place is truly an embarrassment.  1. Let's start off with the service. My family and I weren't even greeted properly. Everyone knows that as a waitress you greet customers with a smile and state your name .... that was never done. It was almost as if she didn't even want to serve us. We didn't feel welcome at all.   2. She only Asked for one I.D at the table. State law requires that you I .D everyone under 40. The party was well below 40 ...  3. Our waitress had a terrible tone and also horrible body language. Once again her body language was so terrible it was embarrassing how obvious she didn't want to serve my family as a group.  4. There was a manager on duty also. I watched him chat with other customers as if he was there for social hour. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG AS GOOD MANAGER YOU INTERACT WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS, but this was far beyond interacting. I sat there very peacefully and just observed how terrible the service was as a whole.  5. Our food did not come out in a timely matter. All of our orders came out separately and not including an order that we were missing. Finally SILVERWARE, cups and glasses. To say the least they were very disgusting marked with lipstick stains from a previous customer.   I can go on for days about this place but I will never return or recommend this establishment to anyone.  But I will say this ..... Andres was not our server but boy would of it been an honor to have him serve us instead. My reasoning for this is because he's the only person who checked up on us as a whole. To be quite honest this seems like a gentleman who can run a establishment like this just to inform you.  I WILL BE CONTACTING CORPORATE DUE TO THE SERVICE FROM MANAGEMENT & OUR \"Server\", PERRY.",

Well, as we are waiting for our food a security guard comes up to me and my fiance and lets us know that my brother has to go. I then look at what trouble my brother may have gotten into. All he was doing was talking to the cook in Spanish. I asked the security guard why is he getting kicked out? I would understand if he was stumbling and looked intoxicated or starting trouble with someone. But he was literally talking to the cook in Spanish.   The security then asked me if I want to speak to his manager. I agreed to. He brings back a very tall big security guy. I'm only 5'2 and I am 117pounds. This huge man come up to me pretty upset. I asked if he was the manager. He said no.  What he did next was the most belittling thing I have EVER experienced. Instead of speaking to me like a normal person. He bear hugs me picks me up and squeezes my arms so I cant move them and carries me outside the bar. Once I am outside he continues to push me and yells at me to leave!!!!! At this point my brother and fiance are being dragged out by 4 other security guards and tackled in the front!  We were not disturbing anyone and for a grown man to put his hands on a woman as small as me is disgusting! I wasn't being kicked out nor was I acting out of hand before \"shrek\" showed up. I was asked if I wanted to speak to a manager and in return I get treated like a criminal for no apparent reason.   THESE SECURITY GUARDS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW HOW DISGUSTING AND DISRESPECTFUL THESES MEN ARE. IT IS NOT SAFE FOR A WOMAN THERE! TO TOP IT ALL OFF THEY MAY ALSO BE PREJUDICE TO HISPANICS. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THAT EXCESSIVE FORCE USED TO PAYING CUSTOMERS ORDERING FOOD FROM YOUR TACO STAND!!!!!!!!!",

The Sandbar has a strong beach theme; there is even a small pool with sand you can go in. It definitely emits a fun atmosphere.  However, this place lacks quality service.  My friends and I had several servers throughout the night and they all seemed pretty inadequate at their jobs.   Two drink orders were completely messed up and my husband's meal was supposed to come with chips and salsa, which was clearly stated on the menu, but the server insisted that it did not.  I watched our waitress spill almost every drink she walked past with.  I can tell they were all working hard, but they were just horrible at their jobs. On the bright side, the food was very good and the blueberry margarita was amazing!",

This place is a bit schizo though. On nights when it is slow, this is a pretty chill bar and a great place to hang out. On nights when it is jam packed, the douchebag index is off the charts. Food's ok - mostly stuff like fish tacos, nachos, cantina fare. Service has usually been pretty decent even when crowded. I used to come with folks from work on Fridays for happy hour but I think the dB factor became a bit much for all of us so we stopped. Same mall as BevMo so if you decide you want to bail and still have drinks, you can stop by to pick up your stash. Lots of parking in this mall.",

    "text": "There is no justification in the service I received. I went to meet a couple of friends the Friday before last. They happen to run into a friend of theirs. That gentlemen ordered some shots, drinks and dinner. I heard him tell the bartender it was on his boss's tab. A while later they tried to get him to pay his tab. He said \"I told you it was on my boss's tab\" Long story short, his boss had left and they never put it on his tab. Some time goes by, the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman I was sitting with. He asked if we knew this other man. The gentleman I was with says he knew him a little, I stated I've never met him before. The manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab. (I personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional) We did not come here with this man, it is not our responsibility). I've bartended in Scottsdale and Vegas. It is the server/bartenders responsibility  to get the credit card when starting a tab. After all, they did make sure to get mine. The manager stated it was just 1 drink ('what's the big deal'?) I clarified with him that it was just one drink? Again he stated yes. I didn't want to deal with trying to get some man I don't know to pay his tab and I didn't enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense, so I said \"If it's just one drink, put it on my tab\" (which I shouldn't have to do). The manager shook my hand and said thank you.  30 min later I closed out my tab. Keep in mind all I had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink. My tab was $62.00!!! The bartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine. I called her over and I told her I found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful. She stated I said I would pay for the whole thing. I stated that was incorrect, she continued to argue with me. Why are we arguing? This is not my friend nor my tab. There is NOTHING to argue about.   She finally went to speak to the manager. After about 10 minutes, she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00. She never apologizes and then runs my card for my drinks plus one of his. I understand I said I would pay for this mans drink, but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab they'll have to eat. Every bar has a spill/comp tab. They shouldn't make anybody else responsible for this...On top of the unprofessionalism, arguing, lack of apology, and wait time to get this solved. As a person who runs a business myself, if my employees neglect to follow protocol (ie; neglect to obtain credit card in this case,) I eat the cost. I most certainly wouldn't have another paying customer cover it.  To make matters worse, myself and a friend (who frequents this establishment) went in to talk to a manager about this incident. I gave the MOD my business card and have yet to hear back from anyone. It has been 10 days. I never yelp about a place without giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... They lack professionalism big time in this place.",

The bar is generally populated with singles, groups of friends, and its a younger set in general - but some of us 60's types go there.  Its NOT a quiet place, and sometimes you will be near people who are obnoxiously loud.  The staff is awesome, but carefully check your bill as this is a rapidly serviced business - its amazing they can keep the orders straight - and mistakes in the check occur - like getting another partys bill.  There is no place like the Sandbar in the area, and its really nice in the spring as things start warming up a bit.  Many people gather here after work, so its best to attend during off times if you desire a little more relaxed atmosphere.  You can get some Vitamin D while you have a few brews.  There are lots of TV's up and running as the general them is an outdoor sports bar, though there is inside seating which can be quieter.",

Saturday morning can be pretty crazy, however don't expect speedy service, or good service for that matter. Not sure what happened this year. Last season the service was much better, the servers were friendly and prompt.   One Saturday I came with the hub and a group of friends. We ordered  2 breakfast burritos off the brunch menu. 20 minutes later, the waitress came by to verify our order (she didn't even put the order in yet!) 40 minutes later we finally got our food. Our drinks took a millennium to get to us as well.   Now I get if a bar or restaurant is busy you will wait more than usual, but communicate that to us. \"Hey we are swamped right now as you can see, I will get your order to you as soon as possible\".  I get when the server has a bad day, we all have them, but it's hard to have a good experience when everyone has on a sour puss.   To be fair, the food we ordered was hot and tasty. Just wish they would -UP-  the customer service a little more.   **ALSO be warned, if you open a tab with a credit card, they put an automatic $50 hold on your account, maybe just bring CASH***",

We had to wait unreasonably long to get an  extra cup of ranch dressing and a second drink. While we waited for our waitress, she blithly chatted with all the single males at the bar (not her station).  The fastest part of the service was when she delivered the bill....she was then back to the table several times then.

Frankly, I don't understand why this place is so jam-packed with people.  Trendiness I guess. I am pretty sure we will not be not be going back.  The saving grace for this place came near the end. As we were finishing for the evening the bar manager came by and he was very friendly. I explained the irritation I had with the fact that their burgers do not come with cheese and that the waitress did not suggest cheese options.   This was a mild irritation made worse by the fact that when I asked the waitress about it earlier she had said, \"It's in the menu\" which, of course, if I had seen that, I would have ordered appropriately.    Well anyhow, without expecting it, requesting it, or even actually wanting it, the bar manager did comp my burger. So, for that I guess we will be back at least once.  But we gotta get there during happy hour cause the drink prices are half-off then.  UPDATE: 8/22/13 As you can see from the comment from Leah below, it is this level of leadership commitment that will bring us back to the restaurant for another go.  I will post a brand new review once we do and update this one if our experience is better.",

I really liked the interior.  It was decorated nicely and had a nice tropical feel to it.  They have colorful lights on the patios, and the walls are painted in a variety of different colors.  Its very festive in here!  We were seated immediately and our service was wonderful.  Drink refills were a bit on the slow side, BUT the service was personable and good overall.  I went with an appitizer becuase even though I was hungry, they seem to have larger portioned dishes here, and didnt want to be overwhelmed with an enormous about of food.  The main entrees tend to run about $10 on average, and they have appitizers with smaller portions for a little bit less.  Being that I was starving, but not wanting a humungous portion I couldnt finish, I stuck with the appitizer.  Food was tasty, and we also were given chips and 2 types of salsa dips to go with them.  Chips were warm and tasty as well.  You can also sit out and eat on the patio, but we opted to sit inside and enjoy the AC.  I would gladly return here for happy hour, dinner with friends or dates for that matter.",

Maybe because the sound wasn't on?  The crowd is always pretty mixed...  i can't really figure this place out.  I definitely saw a strip of bacon in a bloody mary the last time I was here so that's a definite plus.",

My grilled mahi tacos were ok but not great, but I never saw the bartender again until I practically had to flag him down for my tab. The service here is so bad. Female bartenders only wait on men who are drinking beer. They don't make eye contact and won't even acknowledge the female patrons.  Sorry Sandbar, I'm not happy with your service and am sorry I wasted my time there.",

I guess it's True what they say, however, you get what you pay for. The happy hour special for drinks make the margaritas $4, which is a great price, especially since they are kind of strong ... I recommend the frozen peach margarita! And as far as the food goes, it is mediocre. I've gotten the nachos & the mini chimes before. Only three stars because overall, it's alright .. nothing special.",

And here's the reason why the reviews aren't that great: the service. It's not all that grand. The servers and bartenders are pretty young and they just give that amazing service you get at some restaurants. Although, I don't care. My order comes out at a decent time frame, they always have great specials, and they've never given us the wrong order. So, in general, do I feel like I'm the most important person to my server? No. But I don't really care. It's not that important to me. I just care about good food, and cold beer. So it gets 5 stars in my books!!",

The food on the menu is standard middle class Mexican food, from fish tacos to civiches. Most come here for the drinks and order once they are hungry.

There a cabanas for the VIP's and a indoors in case the weather turns sour.

Dropped by last night and they let us in as part of the \"Friends and Family\" pre-grand opening.  Nice place, roomy, great place to watch games; never been to Sandbar in Scottdale or other locations, but this will be a fun spot to frequent - nothing else like it along Ray Rd.  They gutted the old Bahama Breeze and this place is much better!  Food was good; drinks were good; friendly staff - the sand, pool all make it fun.  Big bars; good indoor seating; lots of parking.  Coconut shrimp are really good as an appetizer.  Lots of great HDTV's for game watching...no bad seats for viewing anywhere.  Should be a hit!  Looking forward to going back with some friends.",

Gets our drink order again, brings water/lemon for girl and I get Modelo Negro and I had asked for Modelo Especial. So we get that straight and it's a warm beer in a washed glass. Took one drink, I complained to our waitress and she brings something a tiny bit colder, In between there we ordered food,  drank half and it was warm quickly. Got our food dropped off by a young gentleman. So we sit there while our waitress walks by(doesn't check if we have napkins & utensils) over and over again I'm trying to flag her down. I can see the place is busy, so I ask for a manager. Manager shows up quickly introduces himself asks what can I help you with I explain my warm beer to start, the second isn't any better but I'm trying to drink it, manager says I'll pay for those and gives me his apologies which where sincere! I also tell him that our waitress didn't bring napkins or forks nothing, stating to him isn't she supposed to get us ready for a meal? He (manager)said yes I'm sorry. I said if she's busy she should ask for help or go to you. He (manager) said yes she should have but I'll get the napkins & utensils. So we start eating our cool food at this point. My taco trio weren't the greatest. My girl had hotwings & fries. I ordered a Dr Pepper because of the warm beer. Ok I was going to give them a 1 STAR because of Veronica the waitress. But I went to 2 STARTS because of the management hospitality. He took off the 2 warm beers and comped the 2 Dr Peppers. But I'll say I won't be coming back dues to my service. I always say \" it can be a crappy location but great food, drinks and service and I'll be back in a heartbeat \"",

I have always had great service and everyone here remembers me and my friends and treat us great but tonight I'm not too sure what happened to the customer service. I get it we had a new bartender and she made several mistakes which I get it happens..she's learning... but for someone who literally comes to sandbar 2 times a week or so, I know the prices. Getting charged 7.50 for a budlight on happy hour is ridiculous. The bartender calls over the manager (TIM) who was EXTREMELY rude. He honestly had no hospitality whatsoever. I ask him about the bud light I ordered on happy hour which should have been 3 bucks but instead of politely explaining, he quickly had an attitude and argues with me \"you ordered a michelada\" lol like what? So you mean to tell me that for the extra tomato juice that's going to cost me 4.50? L. I just want to know who in the world is ok with paying an extra 4.50 for tomato juice. lol ANYWAYS I state exactly that and instead he says that I was \"fortunate\" to not get charged by other employees in the past.. LOL at that point I just didn't think it was worth it and obviously he doesn't know how to manage his team if that's how he's going to end the conversation.. by blaming his staff that they weren't charging me correctly in the past and that I just got lucky? I've been here 30+ times so I must be super lucky I guess considering how many times I have ordered that without getting charged. TIM is a joke of a manager and I'm not too sure how he got his position but there are plenty of people in this world that can do way better at his job than he does. Lol advice to anyone.. go somewhere else :)",

I have driven by many times before & it always appeared busy so I finally had the chance to stop in for meal! I got the nachos since the tacos were not on happy hour. The chicken in the nachos was very moist & delicious. They brought out a green salsa that was delicious !! I loved every part of it I could NOT stop eating it! I also got the classic margarita & it was so refreshing not too strong tasting but it did the job! I would totally recommend this restaurant for a cool Mexican meal! The vibe in the restaurant is fun & I'm sure it would be a good time if I came later in the evening. They also play pretty good music!!",

    "text": "Sandbar Mexican Grill hits the mark for a standard suburban bar catering to a specific crowd. I met a high school friend here to drink some beer, watch sports, look at pretty people, and catch up on things. That is the point of this establishment in the Lowe's center on Ray Road near Interstate 10 in Chandler.  The restaurant is rather large with two massive bars dominating the interior and covered patio. Most of the area is partially open to the outside including a corn hole area and contributing to the frat house feel of the place. We chose to sit inside, but it was tough to find a spot quiet enough for conversation. Sandbar is a great place to go when you do not want to talk.  We had some beer and upgraded the chips and salsa to a queso dip. The chips were good, but the salsa was a bit mild for the area. Our queso was also somewhat bland and quickly congealed. The beer was cold and the servers were really nice and helpful, and the environment was nice with lots of happy people enjoying themselves.  Overall, Sandbar hits the target of being a standard bar for current and former frat boys in suburban Chandler. It seems designed for peak party crowds and probably excels at that. Quiet drinks with old friends may not be the best, but we both left with a smile on our face!",

(lol) for clarity by hood rat I mean FUN, CAREFREE, LEGAL, AND SAFE...(don't get it twisted...lol) but this place was BOMB if you like hip hop, rap and all forms of club mixes they got it! if you like to dance or even it you move your body in what you call dance but others would describe as involuntary body spasms this place is for you... IT'S HUGE like if your ex stumbles in they could be avoided all night but I'm sure they wont be there cuz this place if you the cool kids and 99.6% of ex's aren't cool...lol There were plenty of drinks and hotties (whatever your flavor is)...the only down side was there was no food (lol)! The place is call Mexican Grill so I would have liked a small \"club menu\" something just to soak up the booze wings, fries, quesadilla nothing major just a little something something...luckily I'm a pro so I had chips in the car!!

My husband had to remind the waitress not to charge us and she said \"I would have put it in if you had reminded me\". Reminded her when? We barely saw her after the food arrived for our friends.

This is my second time there and my husbands and sons first time. Both times I have received great service and delicious food.

We walked into a packed house of people my friend described as \"at least double our age and wearing half the clothes.\"  Obviously, that's an exaggeration (but not by much).  The place was so smoky (yuck) and the ratio of men to women was probably 3:1. though the ratio of men to ladies was 3:1/4.  We stayed for exactly one drink, wherein my friend declared this was not her type of place.  I couldn't help saying \"I told ya so,\" but she needed to see it for herself.  After last night, I am sure she won't be going back.    The best part of this place?  Getting to talk about the clientele afterward.    I'm not a fan.",

The staff is very friendly and attentive, the food is yummy, the music is awesome and the atmosphere makes me feel miles away from home. I like the openness and sunlight and having been there twice during the day and once on a Friday night, I definitely prefer the crowd and experience during the day.   My waitress Nikki exchanged my food for me and didn't make a fuss even though it was my fault that I ordered the wrong menu item. My boyfriend called the manager Trev over to thank him for the great experience we had and to compliment our waitress. Trev spent at least 15  minutes talking with us and was very friendly and professional.   I live in Ahwatukee and I'm really glad to have a spot like this to break away from the daily grind. It's like a mini-vacation.",

    "text": "So I wrote a bad review last week about the Sandbar. Not to take away from the experience of mine which was not good; after the words of a friend I decided to do a re-write: which I have never done.   I have to say I have been there several times before and have not had a bad experience. Additionally, those I had lunch with that day had no complaints whatsoever and stated the server they have had previously and always has been good.   Also, the AGM did actually contact me and apologized for the experience and offered to buy me lunch.   So a week later, here is my objective non-hungry or quick tempered review.   The food I did have was good. John enjoyed his chicken burrito and Jen along with other coworkers all were very satisfied.  Thursdays  ladies get half prices apps and drinks which is pretty much the draw every week.   The whole experience wasn't perfect but one mistake does not dictate disaster. Like I said I have been here for other occasions and at other times of day and have found it to be a very fun and relaxing place.   I won't promise all my future reviews to be full of hugs and kisses but they will be more well tempered.",

The service however is awful! 2pm on a weekday and it took me 15 min to grab the bartenders attention because she's just talking away with coworkers. On a slow day it shouldn't take me more than 15min to get service. The girls here are more concerned with socializing with their peers than anything else. The service is the only thing they should really start working on",

The musicians were good, a little loud but was a nice touch. Our waitress was attentive and got our orders after bringing out the chips.   Both red and green salsas were served. The green salsa had a peppery tang and was my favorite. The red salsa had a spicy, stewed tomato taste. I ordered the carne asada tacos, they came with rice and beans. The beans tasted canned and there rice was decent. The carne asada was cooked very well and seasoned flavorfully. It was pricey, and there were no actual sand bars :( but overall a good choice for going out.",

Small portion of chicken considering I ordered steak but hey I would have complained but I hardly saw my waitress.  Meat kids orders a nacho and said it tasted like stale chips and over loaded with cheese.  Basically like eating a block over kill.  Tried to talk to the manager about my portion of chicken on the fajita. Remember I ordered steak and I was told it was the correct portion. We bantered a little.  Come to find out it was under the corn? When did corn come with a fajita.  Not impressed at all with this place.  Manager did take off the rice and bean bill.  Not sure how that helps since that usually comes with fajitas every other place.  Basically stay away from this place.   This place is more like a dive bar or sports bar not a Mexican grill.  Owner should be ashamed to call it Mexican food.",

I had rarely seen it in the daylight so it was an interesting change of pace.  I love that they have 805 on tap.  It's one of my favorite beers and I'm happy it's making its way from the central coast to Phoenix.  We ordered chips and salsa-- the red salsa was delicious.  Our waitress kept our drinks full and was super attentive, despite it being pretty busy on a Friday.  It was strange to see kids wandering around playing the bar games.  I'm not sure it's a place I would bring my toddlers at night but okay.  It took a while to get the Dodgers game on one of the TVs.  No one really seemed to know how to change the channel.  So would I still recommend this place?  Sure.  It looks a little different now that I'm in my thirties but it's definitely a fun spot for a night out.",

    "text": "ALWAYS a great time!! If you like music, large crowds, sandy beach vibes, good food, and awesome drinks, you can't go wrong with the Sandbar!  As a new (somewhat) Arizonan, I didn't know about the sandbar until we moved into our house, which is almost within walking distance! During my first visit (Sunday brunch), we sat in the outdoor beach bar area, which is so pretty! The outdoor bar area has open seating but is large. Since we arrived at brunch time, we were expecting it to be somewhat quiet. Well, to my pleasant surprise, the place was LIT! Nothing makes me happier than seeing drunk people at 11 A.M. when I'm sober ;)   We ordered breakfast tacos, shrimp tacos, some sort of kids meal, few drinks, and everything was great. Although our food was good, the experience & the vibe is what makes it \"5 star\" in my opinion. It's very hard to be in a bad mood when you're surrounded by laughter, live music, good food,  drinks, and sand!   After my first visit, I started telling all of our friends & coworkers about the sandbar as if I just discovered a hidden gem :| My other half has lived in Scottsdale in the past & quickly reminded me that everyone knows what the sandbar is so I don't need to give it an elaborate description...Well , regardless of how well known it may be, I think it's underrated. I love a loud crowd & have been faithfully coming here since our first visit! Each time is better than the previous! The girls (and guys) who work here are super friendly & sweet , service is great, and VIBES are to die for!   P.S- Although the location says chandler, this is bordering the Sierra Tempe neighborhood so it's Chandler/Tempe?",

I believe the last time I had visited was back in 2009-2010. I was expecting there to still be sand all over the floors. I guess they've gotten rid of that.   Alright, so my star rating is not because this is some supreme upscale club. However, upon arrival I showed my I.D. indicated to the gent at the door that my friends had a cabana and he directed me through straight to my party. Awesome.   I was able to see from up top and well, it was busy. Surprisingly busy. People dancing, hanging out. Whatever. I was getting down, for sure. The night was filled with 90's-present day Hip-hop and R&B... Rap, whatever. The food wasn't terrible. They had a guy making tacos right there. I don't know, I really can't say I have anything to complain about at all. The server was attentive and no one lasted long with an empty drink.   The crowd was an array of individuals who evidently enjoy 90's - present day hip-hop, r&b, rap with the occasional reggaeton and maybe a reggae song here and there . I was wearing Nike hightops and a jacket, there were others dressed to the 9. I did not feel uncomfortable or out of place. They had heaters and fire to keep folks warm. All in all, I'd be down to head back again. Good for them for still being around.",

We didn't try any of the drinks, as we still had a long drive ahead of us, and that may be what they are best at.",

We went on a taco Tuesday and it was packed so I can understand slow service but we sat there for a good 30 minutes before we were even noticed. Drinks were terrible and expensive when they were supposedly on special that night. We ordered tacos for the great price of 2$ which is unbeatable. We ordered them at 915 and our server came back at 10:05 apologizing saying she entered our order in after the kitchen had closed and that we'd have to get them ourselves from the taco cart they gave up front. We later saw her off the clock drinking at the bar less than 10 minutes later and our food ended up actually still coming out from the kitchen. At this point our tab was already paid and we left the tacos there. Won't be going back unless I'm already drunk. Don't recommend going on taco Tuesdays",

It was okay - we went on a Tuesday and got the awesome Taco Tuesday prices (most tacos are $2 each, a few specialty ones are $3, and house margs are $4) but the service was pretty blah. Our actual waitress was very attentive but the hostess was absolutely clueless about our reservation, which I had confirmed, and she seemed annoyed/frazzled about getting our table together. A few of us went early and had a few drinks at the bar, which was not busy, but the bar tender was hard to flag down and painfully slow.   It wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't good either. It was too hot to go outside so we didn't get to hang out on the sand, which made Sandbar become just another subpar Mexican place.",

May or may not have.   Night time it turns into a club and it gets BUSY last time I was there it took a good 10 minutes to get from the entrance to the dance area mind you this place isn't really THAT big. It's a good time because everyone there is just there to have fun and dance. Everyone is friendly there. They have the grill going by the front with tacos, burgers etc.   Crowd is a mixture of pretty much everything age and nationality wise real diverse.  Nice place to go to if you're really not trying to head to old town or party with the kids on Mill.   Yes there is really sand in Sandbar... they have sand volleyball spot set-up inside..",

During happy hour they had $2.50 Dos Ambers and $4 frozen marguerites. I started with both. The waitress was cool and took excellent care of me all evening - can't remember her name, but the ticket read \"Smiles\". The drinks kept coming, as did the friends, and just a couple of raindrops too. It was an excellent bar for people watching and everyone was friendly.  With the beer, the sand, the reggae it was a very good time. It was my first time there, but I will definitely be back.",

I have been here twice and I'm still unimpressed. Drinks are ok, but I would expect a little more alcohol in my drink- my vodka tonic tasted mostly like tonic. Also, I think I'm generally on the younger side of the crowd here, and I felt slightly out of place. Not trying to offend, and I know its in chandler, but one Saturday night I went, and I swear the average age was 35-40. Its ok for happy hour, but there are certainly better places to go.",

    "text": "I purchased a groupon to try out this place.  The first time I went, it was happy hour and our waitress said our groupon wouldn't be eligible for happy hour prices.  That was okay by myself and my husband and we decided to use our groupon another day.  The drinks were watery, but the appetizers were very good.  We were excited to come back and use our groupon.  Our 2nd visit was at the end of happy hour.  We ordered off the menu and informed our waitress that we had the groupon.  She asked us if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if it was ok, since we were using a groupon.  She assured us it was ok.  Our food arrived and we had a total of 2 drinks.  When we requested the check, our waitress informed us that we could only use $12.00 of the $20.00 groupon...(I had paid $10.00, so this wasn't much of a deal).  My husband suggested to seperate the checks and pay cash for the drinks, we were told that wouldn't be allowed.  Get the $12.00 discount or pay for the entire bill.  We decided to use the groupon another day and pay the check.  We were not happy.  Very poor customer service, especially since we tried to cover all our bases and the waitress made the mistake.  BEWARE GROUPON USERS!!!!   The only reason we are going back is to finally be able to use our groupon.  We WILL NOT be purchasing any alcohol, appetizers or desserts....just the entrees and water.  My husband works with a well known computer company and he is letting any and all know about the poor customer service at this place and to not use them for corporate events.",

Nachos where great, though I'm thankful our server didn't carry them out, I think the shear weight of the plate alone just might crumble her scrawny malnourished frame.

About lost my appetite at the site of the employees, I really wish I had. I ordered the Cx sandwich and the bread was great...  Cx average, the chipotle mayo I think was mixed wrong it was cloyingly sweet and not spicy at all. And the fries came to my table half mashed ( sooo soggy). As for the good a 5$ cover charge for UFC fight 185 not bad, however we had to bribe the manager to turn the horrid music off and play the fight!   The drink specials... Well if a 3$ domestic draft is good then you are golden... That's full price at my restaurant/bar! So there was a bit of sticker shock when we got the bill!   All in all, we might go back for another fight if friends want to go, but for the price we paid I could havemade filets and lobster, a bottle of skull, the comfort of my couch watching the same fight, and be in my pj's with my hubby!",

    "text": "This review is based solely on Sandbar as a nightlife spot, I didn't eat there, just drank, heavily, and danced, heavily, and based on my few moments of clarity between shots these are my thoughts....  Sandbar offers some great music and a dance floor to get your groove on.  It's only been open a week so it was packed! If you don't get there before 10 pm expect to wait in a long line and not find a table to park your drinks at.  The ambience is very cool and it is pretty big, there actually are a lot of tables both inside and out. There are 4 cabanas on the outside patio that you can reserve if you have a large group and promise to spend at least $300, which is very easy to do with a large group. The sand and small pool are a nice touch, I did get a little sand in my shoes but didn't mind one bit. The dance floor isn't huge but it doesn't get too packed we always found a spot to comfortably shake our groove things, the DJ plays hip hop, some rock and even a little country while they show the videos on the flat screens, they even played SNL's digital short On a Boat with Andy Samberg & T-Pain which is very danceable and very hilarious.    Now we did have a few issues but I think it's based on the fact that this place is new and so so packed and management did try to make amends so I'm not going to knock them too much for it. It was my sister's birthday so we called in advance to reserve a cabana for the night but then they called us back a day later and said they had actually overbooked so we no longer had the cabana, we then made reservations for dinner but once we got there they did not have a spot for us to sit, they had anticipated another big party would leave before we got there and they did not, so we had to go somewhere else for food, but the manager offered my sister free drinks when we came back later and they did reserve us some high tops by the dance floor when we came back so that was nice. We never had to wait too long for our waitress to come back around and offer more drinks either, another plus.  Also because it is so packed there is more of a possibility of having a few knucklheads in the crowd, we actually saw a fight early in the night, small and squashed quickly. Then later in the evening some drunky tried to fight a guy in our group, I think this drunky had little man complex and he was in the crowd and he bumped into our friend at the same time that someone else bumped into him so he thought our friend purposely bumped him. Our friend was actually the designated driver so he was completely sober and the drunk 5 foot tall guy tried to fight the sober 6 foot tall guy who kept telling him to walk away, which he did, only to come back later with his 5 1/2 foot tall friend to avenge him. It was all stupid and the management could see that it was just two drunk guys trying to prove they weren't scared of the big guy and they kicked the knuckleheads out and let us stay.  The night was saved and we actually stayed until the last song at 2 a.m. chit chatting and dancing the night away.  I will definitely go back, maybe not for a few weeks when it isn't so crowded but with it being one of the few dance spots in Chandler this probably won't happen any time soon, which is good for them. We went on a Saturday but I've heard Friday is just as packed.",

Long story short obviously I do a lot of traveling around the world and go to a lot of different places to try different food. The customer service was amazing from the time I walked into the restaurant until I left. He introduced us to a few margaritas on the menu that's i never heard of and I also was a little worried about trying. Once the margaritas arrived to the table and I tried them I told him he could go ahead an place 2 more in for me because it was the best one I have ever had in a very long time. He had a compete smile on his face the entire night, he always had a positive attitude and checked on us frequently...and I can honestly say he knows exactly how to treat customers and he knows the menu/liquor menu very well. He definitely deserves a management position. Each and every time I come to Sandbar I hope to see his face!!! I will be sending the rest of my flight attendant friends that have many layovers there to ask for him because he did such an amazing job I honestly have no complaints. On top of that the food was A1+. Definitely will be coming back in the near future. Thanks for everything JAKE!!!",

We left because it became a chore to get our drinks refreshed. We also sat near the bar and saw at least one drunk argument between boyfriend/girlfriend that resulted in a smashed beer bottle. I don't think it was even 7pm yet.  Came back for Lunch yesterday with my wife and enjoyed the service and food. When you walk in and head to the patio you have a feeling there was a party there the night before.   It was clean, but the feeling was from the broken sun umbrellas, and the decor. After climbing around tables and patio heaters we found a spot in the shade and in the sand.  The bartender was our server and did a great job.  We each had one of their specials and enjoyed it.  Would be happy if this became our weekly lunch spot.",

Then our 2 other friends showed up so we decided to sit at a table. After being served another 4 drinks by our new waitress (over a period of another 2 or so hours) we were wondering why we werent being served. Once getting our special lady's attention she informed us our bartender (our original server) explained to us we needed to go to the bar. My ? was why now after this girl has been serving not only us but our new guest for the passed two hours. He felt entitled to our tips... Well he received nothing especially after the outside bar manager was also extremely rude. Needless to say I paid my tab, paid my waitress who was friendly and worked very hard and went to leave the place.  Walking out the door the outside bar manager waved sarcastically to me I said \"Goodbye have a great night!\".. I will never go back even though its a mile up the road. Great injustice to the sweet waitresses, maybe they should manage. They had better customer service than the supposed manager :(",

However, the service TODAY was NOT the best for a first impression. it took me 30mins to get a drank, and 40 mins to be served. I had to get my own menu, cuz home girl didn't come back to the table. The food,, when it DID come was luke warm to cool. Now, i will say, it was alittle busy, but not THAT busy. I was pissed. Buy the time my friend got there. We were ready to order, but could get THAT done until we gr abed one of the other waiter tending to HER table promptly. The menu is pretty standard. Meals range $7 - 15. The drink was good. My friend asked for the mgr and told him we weren't happy about the service nor meal TIME. He promptly took care of our meal. We weren't looking for him to do that though. And said, next time we come in, to ask for him. I'd say.....mmmmm I'll give them a pass this time. I'll probably go again though. Its a pretty cool spot.

    "text": "Here is an update to my earlier review! In fairness, management was listening. I arrived on a Thursday night and it was busy but not ridiculously packed. The crowd still seemed trashy but they were at least well behaved this time. I think management deserves credit for that. You didn't see the typical Golds Gym meatheads thinking they are dressing trendy with their Underarmor black shirts and jeans! A noticeable change was the staff! The bartender was actually polite and friendly and didn't have the faux wannabe Scottsdale attitude. Waiters and busboys kept coming around asking if we would like refills on drinks. There was a table of beautiful women that deliberately sat inside to avoid the crowd outside which tells me a lot about this place...namely they were there for the drinks prior to venturing to Scottsdale and didn't want to be disturbed by all the guys outside. It was definitely not a pick up kind of place. And in terms of diversity...what people are really meaning to say are African Americans! It was still 90% white but just seeing any color at a Phoenix venue is a nice change and shows that our state is making progress; it definitely felt less NASCAR if you know what I mean. The dress code and cover charge for guys is a good start and it has helped eliminate the shadiness so the management deserves much acclaim for this.   However, there were still problems. The management has to better control the parking area. Some type of security needs to be present at all times in the parking lot because you can still see random guys pissing on cars and groups huddled that a look a bit sketchy. The dress code for the guys has to be better emphasized. Non-sneakers and non-baggy jeans doesn't do enough especially when 40 year old Joe shows up in a polo shirt, and bleached jeans. Dressing well is not limited to Scottsdale. How about something as simple as a black button down shirt, nice jeans and leather shoes! Lastly, the female waistaff and service has NOT improved. They could learn a thing or two from the guys. There was still a lot of that stuck attitude that was present in November. The management needs to better emphasize friendlier service from their female waitstaff and bartenders.",

BUT, the last 2 times I've eaten here the food has been average, the ice tea horrible, and the service so slow.  My drink came right away but the tea was so bitter I couldn't drink it.  My food was dropped off and I was half way through before anyone stopped by.  I asked for a different drink and had to ask for a napkin.  When I was completely done eating (and had been out of a drink for at least 15 minutes) did the waitress check on me.  And there was only 1 other table with people inside.   The waitress was very friendly, though and my food was good this time. The last time I was here it took 20 minutes to get our check back from the waitress so we could pay and again it wasn't busy in there. Plus our food was burned.  I had hoped for better service this time but it didn't happen.",

    "text": "DO NOT GO HERE!! This restaurant is morally disgusting. My father bit into his taco and felt a huge crack and pain on his tooth. A pebble of glass was in his food! He notified the waiter and the waiter apologized. My father was informed that if he had any issues with his tooth to let them know and they would take care of it. He went to the dentist and he cracked his tooth completely to the root and needed a full root canal. He contacted the manager to let them know of the dental bills and they have never gotten back to him. it's been well over 10 months now. I'm encouraging my dad to file a report with the corporate office before he takes any other action. For the sake of this business I hope my father has just been dealing with a neglagent manager and this isn't the type of reputation corporate would approve of. My father never threatened to sue and was content with the fact that they were going to cover the damaged but are YET to do so. It's too bad this place chose to not do the honest and right thing. We are all encouraging and hoping that my dad will file a lawsuit against this place. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!",

I ate some food and had a few drinks.  My food had a hair in it but that did not bother me because things like that happen.  I talked to a few people around the bar then shortly after a bouncer asked me to talk to him by the door then they kicked me out.  When I asked why they said they did not need to tell me why I just had to go.  I thought it was very strange I was not bothering anyone and they would not tell me why I was getting kicked out.  I asked them if there was a misunderstanding if they had the wrong person but they would not answer any questions.    On a positive note since they would not listen to me or answer any of my questions, I tried to tell them I had a open tab and wanted to pay for it but they would not listen to that either.  Since they were so rude and would not let me settle my bill I called my credit card company and canceled the charge since I was not allowed to see or sign the bill.  I am visiting from out of town for a supplier conference and was checking the place out before I scheduled our supplier conference outing next week for a large group. Of course I will be telling all of our suppliers and everyone else at the conference the story of how I was treated and to not visit this place.",

There were several female severs standing around the bar area socializing, nothing else. Our server finally arrived after about 15 minutes. Took another 10 minutes to bring us our ice tea and water, which both tasted very bad. Our drinks were never refilled once. After being there for 40 minutes how much longer it would take our food because we were in a hurry. All of the plates and silverware were dirty... Blahhhh....When our burritos finally arrived, they were soaked in grease... GROSS!!!! I wouldn't ever come back here even if I was paid!",

My wife got a breakfast burrito and I got the carne asada tacos.  both were good.  Can't complain about the food.    The outdoor patio was nice, with a big cabana bar and tables set in sandy areas.  Overall this place seems more of a place to go at night to get your drink on.  From reading the previous reviews I can only imagine what the clientele looks like.  Based in the following I think I know.  As my wife and I were walking out to our car, some young guy was dropping off a girl at her car in the parking lot.  While I was laughing the guy in the car made eye contact with me and started to laugh too.  I just hope he was nice enough to get the poor girl breakfast!",

I called a few days later to make sure it was okay to send my husband to pick up the card.  They said as long as I gave him my license, it was fine.  That wasn't the case when he got there.  He wasted 30 minutes because the manager said due to liability, they couldn't give him my card... regardless of what his employee said.  I was extremely frustrated, especially since he was not willing to work with me at all.  I told him that I was disappointed because I could have sent whatever proof they needed, even skyped for proof and if I would have known he couldn't pick up the card, I wouldn't have wasted his time.  I even asked if they could mail the card and he said no. I sent a letter explaining my frustration and never heard back. So a few days later, I drive out to Chandler myself only to find out that my card was missing.  No one could find it but they promised to call me that day.  2 weeks later, still no card and no call.  And even though they acknowledged that they received my letter while I was there, they never responded. I called today to learn that they cut up the cards after a week because so many people  leave their cards there.  Sooooo frustrated, not with the policy, but it seems their employees should know the policy.  It would have saved me two trips, totaling an hour of wasted time and frustration.  If you MUST go to this place, use cash.",

    "text": "This has been the worst experience I have ever received at a business establishment. So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member..   This is how the story goes:  My girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd.   At this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow.   So we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow.   So then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.  It's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone.   So officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins..... *This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*  NOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!",

Good mix of music, food, and drinks. After the ball dropped, another DJ took over. That DJ was horrible. He played the same 10 songs repeatedly. We had a party of 8 and it killed the whole vibe. We originally chose sandbar because it normally plays good music and has a good vibe. This time was not the case. Please realize that the music is what fuels the party; and if that is not on point, then the crowd will not respond well. The dance floor became ghost town once the same songs kept being played. 2017 was a great year in music and Sandbar chose to ignore that. Please prepare better music to ensure your crowd actually enjoys themselves. Especially on New year's.",

Without realizing it was Tuesday, we went to this restaurant to find their awesome Taco Tuesday deals, which made my food choice instantly easier. Their fish tacos are definitely my favorite. The only down side was that our server seemed to disappear for a while at a time, especially when it came time to ask for the check. Other than that I would highly recommend this place to anybody that comes to visit me.",

    "text": "Straight up a 3. No complaints about the food, but it's really nothing to write home about. Sandbar is much more a bar than a restaurant. To call it a Mexican restaurant is generous as the menu is very limited, with only the very basic Tex Mex items being offered. Service was fair. Our waitress made no secret of the fact that she was very busy. Also, there was no host/hostess, so we seated ourselves and just waited for a waitress to appear. She asked for our order when we didn't even have menus! Being mostly a bar, Sandbar is extremely loud, so don't go looking for an intimate evening or even to have a conversation with your fellow diners. The music is loud, but good. Definitely a place to go for a fun night out.",

The frozen margaritas were good (prickly pear was a bit sweet).   Worst part: The PokeStop isn't in reach from the indoor bar. It's apparently at the tiki at the entrance, and it really sucks that it is out of range. Oh well.  The Sandbar is decent. It'll be even better starting football season. Next time I'll try more of the menu.",

Service was provided by a server named Krissie. Not only did our server not warn us that the kitchen would be closing so we didn't have a chance to order more tacos (I literally left hungry) but she also forgot every single persons order and then forced us to close our tabs because she was cut. Being a former server myself this is beyond ignorant and disrespectful behavior. Despite the tacos being good I will not be coming back to this establishment.",

We ordered the trio appetizer with spicy beans, queso, guac and chips. The beans and queso were great but the guac was very average. It as served with 2 salsas: a very citrusy green and a chipotle red. They were okay, but nothing we would crave.   I ordered an apple, Gorgonzola salad with the prickly pear vinaigrette. The salad was drenched to the point of soggy. It also was served with chicken which I didn't order but the waitress was good about taking it back and removing it from the bill. The couple of bites I attempted to slurp down weren't impressive so I probably would t try it again.   My husband got the beef tacos. Again, they were okay but not great. Service was good, not as regular as a normal restaurant but a step up from service in bars.   Would we come again? Eh....probably not unless someone wanted to meet here. Even then we oils probably order the trio of dips and leave it at that.",

Me & my friends all married , college educated  , successful black women decided to go out for a much needed mommy break after church for some brunch . It took our waiter over 25 minutes to even come and greet us . We watched her go to several tables near us , greet them , ask if there was anything they needed , and her go over to the bar and talk with her coworkers. We assumed she was not even our waiter . When she came over no introductions, just a simple \"what can I get you \" . We ignored her rudeness and placed our orders. My silverware was covered in food , I asked her 3 different occasions for another clean pair of silverware , 16 minutes after our food arrived still no silverware . A very nice guy ended up giving me a pair . She still walked by not even knowing someone else had brought me a pair . When she walked by again we simply advised her she still hadn't brought any silverware she begin to yell ,  advised What would we like her to do about become offensive and run off to the bathroom . We advised her supervisor and he did nothing but offer a $3.50 discount for the inconvenience. She did not come back to the table . Again the guest next to us , across from us was greeted with smiles , checked on every 20 seconds . When the bill arrived my friend walked up to her and was simply just going to tell her how she was inappropriate and how for the next guest she may want to attempt to do better . The waiter literally threw the card at my friend . Some guy (white) behind the counter then begin yelling at my friend telling her to , \"Get out his restaurant \" and got in my friend face . This was the worst experience and I would never go aback . Why were we deprived great service and treated and in such a ill matter the only difference between me my friends and the remainder of the guest who were treated with nothing but respect was our skin color .",

My family decided to stop here for lunch after shopping at the local stores. This included 2 adults, a teen and a toddler.  Place was dead on a Saturday at noon. Weird, but ok. Perhaps I should have taken that as a sign.   Sat down in a booth. The booth next to us was attracting flies because no one had apparently bussed the table for quite a few hours. Food was crusting on the plates.  Margarita that I ordered was so watered down and in a dirty glass (I now have a sore throat). Ordered queso as an app and it was cold and unbelievably flavorless. Chips were cold and stale. Inedible.  My toddler was playing in the booth and I noticed her hands were dirty. Looked at back of booth(s) and they were covered in dust. I'm assuming that servers aren't asked to do closing duties when checking out. Basically the place was really dirty. Including utensils and plates.   Took 45 minutes, yes you read that right, 45 minutes to get a kids burger and 2 orders of enchiladas.  Waitress checked on us ONCE throughout the meal. Once!  The food tasted like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for 45 minutes. I took one bite and was done. Inedible. Seriously.   Took another 30 minutes to get check. By this time my toddler was screaming and ready to go. So was I! I wish I could have screamed! They were dead. Why the delay in service and food?!  I was so looking forward to some yummy Mexican food and left the restaurant completely grossed out with possibly some funk.  Won't be back.",

The red salsa tasted like canned tomato sauce, the fajitas had kind of a weird flavor to them (can't pinpoint what it was, but it was not good), and the nachos we ordered had cold, unmelted cheese on them. To top it off, the service was almost non-existent. The only thing we did enjoy was the green salsa... and when we asked for more of it, the waiter guy said coming right up ~~ and legit never came back. So we ate our meal without any green salsa to add flavor to the otherwise bleh meal. Really disappointed in Sandbar.",

They are SUNGLASSES ?? Why can't sunglasses be in hand ?  Second after the guy checks our IDs we go to the next man who is by the girl who takes the cover ( first of all when in the hell did they start charging ? It's a bar/restaurant ....) the next man tell my uncle his jeans are to baggy and he has to go, my uncles jeans were like any other young man out here and they weren't baggy he was just sagging a little... So then my grandpa begins to get upset and they tell him he doesn't meet dress code either because of his bottoms. YALL MY GRANDPA HAD ON A BUTTON UP & SOME NICE SHORTS (not sagging at all) and nice shoes... then some young boys had on the SAME type of jeans my uncle had on & I tell them what happened, they walk up and both get declined to enter because they are sagging !!!! They all were barely sagging and both of them had on belts with there jeans.... so then we all trippin , goin off... THEN a set of white boys with the SAME type of Jeans , both sagging off there butt a little bit go on walk up & they let them right in !!!!!! Also a BLACK older man who was walking out states they gave him a hard time & kept carding him inside...First off since when did sandbar get a strict dress code & when was normal nice casual clothing not aloud? When people of color show up in them ? Oh okay !  This is all coming from a place where you use to be able to just walk right in & have any type of clothing you want on..And any and everyone was welcome...I have never felt sooo disrespected & catch this as we were standing there watching all these ppl go in, literally just watching them let NON COLORED people go in just in shock. The police walk up... They really called the cops on us as if we were all in the wrong... All in all Sandbar lost a loyal customer, will not go back & will be sharing my story every where and they will get nothing but bad ratings from me... WE ARE ALL THE SAME! RACIAL PROFILING IS REALLY REAL... sad..... Everyone pls stay woke & be careful out there! PICTURE SHOWN IS WHAT THEY BOTH WORE LASTNIGHT ( uncle on left & grandpa on the right) #share #sandbar #BLACKLIVESMATTER",

We waived at her and asked if they were open while she pretended not to see us. She finally hesitantly opened the door and said, \"we're still getting ready to open\". This was irritating, and I almost told my husband that we should leave. But we waited a few minutes and we were finally seated outside.   It took about 5 minutes for our server to come to our table. She was friendly and took our drink order. There were several other servers and the half asleep Hostess lingering around outside. They decided this would be a great time for them all to have a mini photo shoot while my husband and I waited patiently for our drinks to arrive....  We then placed our food order; chicken tacos with beans and rice. The food arrived quickly and was delicious.   The patio and food are amazing, but the service and lack of professionalism is disappointing.

Oh the irony ... the place is called Sandbar.  Sand + Margaritas = a damn good time.  They just go together like that.  The bartenders aren't attentive whether or not the bar is crowded or not.  They're more attentive to each other.  Literally every time we flagged a bartender down she was talking to another server, fixing her hair or putting her phone down.  This was during happy hour time, on a Wednesday, kind of a low key time.  I've been to Sandbar on a Saturday evening and experience some of the same things.  I think it wasn't that much of an issue on a Saturday night because I was with about 7 or 8 other people, we were personally having a good time chatting and catching up with each other so we didn't really notice how long it took to get drinks.  I'd only visit Sandbar if a friend was having a special event or something.  I wouldn't bother going for Happy Hour.",

Bill saw my complaint and immediately left two voicemails, an emall and eventually invited me and my wife for lunch today via facebook.  We were greeted by the very pleasant Jen as we walked in. Our waiter was very pleasant and funny without being too over the top.  We started off with chips and a great trio of salsa and cheese dip. My wife had a very tasty burrito and my ahi and shrimp tacos had a great combo of spicy and sweet. (FYI Tuesday is $2 tacos).  We finished off with fried ice cream with fresh pineapples. A tasty end to the meal and the beginning of my food coma.  In a time when you hear more excuses than accountability, Sandbar Chandler was a refreshing change.  They are back on my radar. Thanks Bill.",

That said, you have to appreciate this joint for what it is: decent food, reasonable drink prices, and entertaining people watching.  I sat with friends for close to 2.5 hours and after tip my tab was just over $10 - that doesn't suck.  Most of the waitresses are nice, and easy on the eyes - so service is consistently average.  They have a plethora of tvs and there is actually sand on the patio, which I guess is kind of unique.  If you're patio bound, you may have to deal with the smokers, but most of them are considerate enough to not be a bother.  Check this place out some time for happy hour - that's your best bet for having a good time.",

I love coming to this place for happy hours, birthdays, weekends, etc.   However, last week I came on Saturday for lunch with a group of friends that eat here regularly.  We actually drove from central Scottsdale because they raved about the tacos. Being a Mexican food lover I couldn't wait to try these tacos and I'm super picky.  I ordered the taco platter which comes with three large tacos. My biggest challenge (like always) was deciding which kind to get. I ended up getting a carnitas, chicken and carne asada taco. I figured I'd like one more than the other but each of them was fantastic!  Each had their own special flavor and unique taste. There was nothing bland about it.  The margarita was perfect and the chips and salsa were amazing also. Try both the green and traditional salsa - again I'm picky and I could have eaten 10 servings of this. Everything was amazing. We will be back very soon for lunch and dinner.",

We were pretty much keeping to ourselves at the patio and hand one of these power hungry jerks decided we had to leave.  He asked me wife if she was ok while we were seated at a table.  She turned to him and said yes and went back to her conversation.  He said 'you're out of here\" for no good reason.  I said hold on, what's the problem so I had to go too. The guy did everything he could to antagonize me, too.  After starting a loud argument with the little jerk, he got his bouncing buddies to quickly rush us out of the door with no explanation.  They were really aggressive about it, and pretty much pushed the ladies out.  My wife tripped while they were rushing us out and actually fell in the pool.  This guy was just a GOON looking for trouble and using his pay nothing job as an excuse to exert his minimal authority.  And from the other reviews on Yelp, this is not rare for this place..  BEWARE OF THESE BOUNCING LOSERS!  Also, when I managed to get the waitress to come over so I could pay our bill, she said this was pretty typical for the bouncers and rolled her eyes.  Well, they just lost a customer.  I would NEVER pay another dime and will make sure none of my friends ever go here again either.",

    "text": "This is an update to a previous review. The bar manager reached out to me on Facebook for the way we were treated and asked me to come down to speak directly with him. He  apologized profusely for the issues we experienced during that night. We did not receive any discount, however we never ate when we first came. I am not out to collect a discount or throw my weight around to get one. I am here to be honest and forthright. So, I do thank Stephen for taking his time to follow up with me.   ~Fud/Drink~ The food is pretty typical for a non traditional Mexican bar. The appetizers were nothing too special, they did taste good, that I can say. The cheese/salsa dip we ordered as an appetizer was pretty average, until you add the stellar Tomatillo salsa which it came with. They had crawfish/Shrimp taco specials for Mardis Gras, and I was surprised with the freshness of the tacos. They actually tasted good, so I was impressed...It was still gringo-esque food, but i got to hand it to them, the tacos tasted great considering I left full and satisfied. Looking over the menu, you can tell the place is set up for drinking, I mean come on.. its obvious. But if you get a taco plate it will be worth it, I am not sure of the quality of other dishes. If you want traditional and well cooked Mexican, there are so many places to go here in AZ its insane. But you come here to have some tasty Margs, a yummy taco plate or an app with friends. They have a full bar that pumps out a long lineup of drinks, they all sound good, I will have to try that next time. The drinks that came out tasted good, I didn't try any margaritas, I had to drive home.. Next time...  ~Atmosphere/Service~ It is a pretty neat place to hang out after work. Violeta H. is spot on, this place is great for HH and after work. My fiance and I noted that it was just perfect with as far as the noise goes...not too loud, but not too soft. This is a perfect spot to cool down after a long day of work. Atmosphere was just right and I definitely felt better sitting down with a couple drinks in hand. The service was good, our server knew the menu well, and on queue recited all the specials going on that day for Mardis Gras. Our food and drinks came out quickly despite it being a busy Friday night. The service overall was outstanding, and much better than I could have possibly expected for a busy night.  ~Extras/Rating~  First off, the overall experience is worthy of 3.5 stars, but we still do not have that option. To get rated 4 stars overall you have to have insanely good Mexican dishes that feel authentic. That's not the case here. Sandbar has a lot of competition in that department, so they are an average place to eat at. The food prices are also a tad bit high, which drives down the rating. Same for the drink prices, but HH is great and worth a visit. Stephen informed me of the changes they made to security, so we will see if they make a difference. I am confident they will help the customer experience, as they did a good job coming back from the experience I had previously. As of now, Sandbar is A-OK in my book and perfect for an after work relaxer. I would suggest you give them a try before it gets too late out, that's my final tip! Keep the drinks and the yummy tacos coming and I will be happy!",

Once we were seated with our menus we were wishing we had started there rather than finishing because it was Taco Tuesday and they had $2 tacos!!!  That would have been way better than the average-at-best sushi we had eaten just before....so in order to drown our sorrows we got straight to the business of discounted drinks!  I can't recall all the drink specials but I know wells were $4 and I think drafts were $3?  Our waitress was awesome too, she stopped by pretty frequently to see how we were doing and get us whatever we needed, plus she was super friendly and was joking around with us.  I wish I would have gotten her name!  Definitely a happy hour I will be frequenting again in the future!",

Not the pretentious, douchey bottle service crowd, but just people having a few drinks and a good time.  Why is it that everywhere in the valley with a dance floor has to be pretentious and douchey anyways?  The bar has a cool set up with sand outside to give it a beach type of feel, so be careful if you have on white shoes with that.  I have had issues with the waitresses her in the past not being willing to switch a tab over and making me cash out at the bar or just being uppity in general, but it was never enough to ruin my night.  The other issue is with the music when I have gone.  The Djs there don't really seem to be fluid in their mixes and can really kill the vibe clearing out the dance floor quickly.  I don't want to accuse anyone of anything, but the mixes sound bottled almost like they were arranged before the night started and I think a better DJ could keep the floor packed and just make for a better overall time.",

After dinner, we stopped at Sandbar for a quick drink to catch up around 10'ish.  First off... outdoor bar in January?  Awesome.  Coming from CA, I'm used to the warmer-than-usual winters, but having 70-degrees at 10pm?  sweeeet.    The bar itself was average, the staff virtually non-existent besides the bartenders flirting with a few patrons.  ...and the patrons?  pretty much a mix of everything you could imagine.  Blue-collar workers, business men/women, scantily-clad women whose provocative nature screamed of low self-esteem, and jersey shore wanna-be's.  So yeah, they have a bit of everything.

It also reminds me of what art critic Robert Hughes said about Las Vegas: \"The land of instant riches and perpetual orgasm\".    Party party party. Fun fun fun.  Anyway, they have bars and sell drinks and have Mexican food. The waitresses are young and cute.  Oh, and I do suspect -- as others here have suggested -- that many of the patrons are not entirely self-actualized and thus are not acting in a state of full existential freedom in attending this place.  In other words, they tend to be drunk and horny.  It also can be hard to find a place to park some nights.  And no, in fact I didn't get laid there, and that fact is probably weighing on this less-than-enthusiastic review. Thanks for asking!",

When we got there (about 15mins later, I live near by) it was NOT happy hour. We sat ourselves which was fine but when the waitress finally came she didn't know what specials they had and what some of the menu items were. Maybe she was new? Idk. But being a server myself at one point, I know you're suppose to know what the menu items consist of, at least be able about to tell me how something is or make a recommendation. Nonetheless the food was very good. We ordered Mexican pizza for an app and shrimp tacos and chicken fajita as the meals. Everything came out at the same time. I was upset about that bc the food was kinda cold once we finished the appetizer, but I didn't make a fuss about it. I'd def come back though bc the drinks and food were good and not too pricey and it's close to my house.",

Beachy kind of atmosphere - a little corny but hey, this is a fun place so I don't take it too seriously.  Margaritas were good.  Bartender was hot.  Food was ok, but hey it's bar food so I didn't expect great.  Good place to hang out and drink.",

After ten minutes had passed, a member of my party attempted to signal the waiter, as he was seemingly scanning the patio.  After fifteen minutes of waiting we left our table and exited the establishment without so much as a goodbye.  I called the location to inform them of my lack of service and after being on hold or ten minutes, I spoke with Gabe (Manager) who offered to \"assist\" me the next time I returned, if I identified myself to him.  I instead chose to patronize a tried and True establishment in Chandler known as CK's.  In my fifteen minute patio experience at CK''s I was greeted, my drinks were served, and my appetizer and two entrees all arived in less than fifteen minutes.",

There's lots of sand, a great DJ, awesome dance floor with lights and foggers, and in my opinion it's the night-life of Chandler. The servers are friendly, always running around in the sand (don't know how they do it) and the bar staff was very busy and always made our drinks promptly with a smile. The staff seems to love working with each other and it really gives the place a friendly feel. I will definitely be going back and can't wait to see what they have going on for Halloween!",

Having been before, the atmosphere, margaritas & barstaff was one of the primary reasons for our return. We spent about 3 hours, roughly 5-8pm on a weekday, and could not have had more fun. The music was lay-back/chill, perfect for the environment, and the girls making our cocktails were totally upbeat & spirit lifting! They had snazzy attitude and made us laugh!  Short & sweet ....we liked it before, comin' back for more :)  M. Perez",

It's a pretty fun spot to go hang out and have drinks when I don't feel like going to Mill Ave or Old Town. When it first opened up, it would get stupid packed but as time progressed the crowd slowly subsided. There are nights when it still gets pretty packed but still enjoyable. Crowd here is mixed, which I like. It doesn't take very long to get drinks which can be a buzzkill sometimes. Their bar is pretty well stocked and they seem to have most of the things I've asked for. I like to switch things up now and then. There is also a little small dance floor area should your heart (or feet) desire to do so.",
