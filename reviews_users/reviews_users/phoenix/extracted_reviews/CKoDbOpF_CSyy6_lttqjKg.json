For an establishment that strives on sex appeal; the servers/waitresses need to go through better training because they are not good saleswomen at all. And the atmosphere is...ordinary. Nothing special at all like it could/should be.",

Lol nice set up with TV's all over and I loved the that they had large booths. The staff was truly nice and Rylee our waitress was a sweet heart. Loved her smile and service. I did notice the girls uniform (short shorts) was a little much... but it's a bar, lol . So if you are a jealous lady please don't go here with your husband. I had nothing to worry about cause I am gorgeous . Ordered chips, salsa, and queso. Salsa was warm, different but yum! We all ordered the Phili sandwich, 3 different ways! They got it right and it was amazzzzzzzing! I truly must recommend you try this place. Again the music is louder then it should be but the food and service is yaasssssss I am going back soon.",

    "text": "A hard place to find My wife and I set the gps to find the restaurant on customer appreciation night for dinner. Most of the places are easily seen from the street. We pulled into the shopping center, and still hard to find as it is tucked away in the back corner of the shopping center, by a hotel, with most of the sign lights out - \"eaks\" is all that was lit. we parked, and started to walk over, and then noticed the lower signs \"parking and door on the other side\". The patio which was dark, and on the back side of the restaurant is what is visible when we drove up. We went around to the front door, and no lights at that door either. It turned out to be a very slow night for the location, on customer appreciation night, as the hostess was already sent home for the night, and only 4 waitresses at the time. We waited at the desk a moment till a waitress noticed us standing there looking around for someone. She ended up being our waitress. Towards the end of meal, she was cut for the night also. She bought the check over for us to pay before she could go home. The bartender, and other waitresses had time to visit with customers. No promotions on the social media for this location, and hidden away in a dark corner of the shopping center. This might explain a very slow dead night at that this location on a night that should have been busy. This is the only location that we have seen that wasn't busy when we arrived, or while we were there.",

You enter through a patio entrance and are left to meander through the restaurant with no signage guiding you to the hostess. However, there is signage warning that self seating is disallowed. After a bunch of weird looks from waitresses, i found the hostess. Not one waitress greeted me or directed on my journey. When we were seated our waitress kept walking past us with our food and drink. She said she forgot what we looked like. Lastly, the waitress had long hair that was hanging into our food, shouldnt it be tied up or something?",

They said they knew just the place. A short drive later we went to Twin Peaks.  I asked the buddies what type of place this was and they said comfort food and bar. I walked in and it looked like a huge log cabin.  I looked around and the servers were classy but definitely showing assets.  I asked my buddies why they called this place \"Twin Peaks\" thinking with the mountain theme and such, it's based upon a region. They gave me that, \"Are you that stupid\" look and I quickly realized what an idiot I was.  Twin Peaks,, servers wearing tight shirts, duh.. ok, ok, I get it. Even tho the girls were showing what they have, it was done in a classy way. I refuse to go to Hooters because it's sort of trashy, from the servers to the food. This place shows all others you can have both, great food, sexy servers and still be classy where families can come.  I ordered a cold brew and their venison chili. Both great. Chicken wings and everything else ordered was awesome. The prices were also impressive. Can't say enough about this place.  I discovered they have one in vegas which I will make sure I visit next time I am there.  TV's were everywhere and wish they had a place like this near where I live.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this place got  so many 1 or 2 star ratings.  It obviously isn't the Ritz, but we know that going in.  It's a chain with standard bar food & skimpy dressed girls.  We went in today for our free memorial day meal.  The main webpage said we could have anything on the menu under $14.95 for free  so I looked at the menu online and had my taste buds set on the pot roast dinner which was $14.75.  But when we got there we were shown a small list  food  menu with cheaper $7-$9 items we had to pick from.  No pot roast for us!  I wasn't too happy but  okay it's free so why bitch.  The chicken tenders were good enough. They do have the coldest beer in town, and that makes it worth one star.    Service was above average.  The girls here are a bit better looking than Hooters tramps, and a bit smarter.  The place is clean and bathrooms too.  The  beers are not cheap running $6-$7 but they are huge.  You can get a half size but only save a buck. They are open late, which is good.   Overall a good place for happy hour where you save money.  I would go back if I needed a late night snack I guess. Perhaps next year they will give us the free pot roast. If I win the lotto I will certainly go back and get  one of those hot chicks to move in with me.  Or perhaps two!",

In the first 10 minutes we were there today, 3 servers walked right past us, including after we got the attention of one girl. They appeared to be socializing with another table. Our server was very attentive, as I said. She did a great job. The highlight of our trip was when one of the hostesses walked past out table yelling, \"Someone's gotta pee! Someone's gotta pee!\" over and over again. I guess in my profession that's something one keeps to oneself.",

    "text": "Stayed next door at the hotel before catching a morning flight.  Having been to Hooters and a TKs before, I was hoping for something a little better.  It did not disappoint.  I can only speak to the bar area, as it was just me.  They have 14 to 20 beers on tap.  Two were from the local Four Peaks brewery, and several others looked promising.  At $5.25 for a 22 oz microbrew during happy hour that is a pretty good deal.  Had the chicken finger \"teaser\" which was pleasantly surprising.  Here are my suggestions for improvement:  Turn down the music just a tad.  I could hardly hear the people two feet away from me I was conversing with at the bar and the bartenders really had to strain to hear my order.  Turn up the beer temperature.  Don't get me wrong, 29 degree beer is good, however depending on the alcohol content, beer ingredients start to separate at about 28 degrees.  At one point one of the screens said the beer temp was 27.6 or 26.7.  Probably someone who doesn't know bout beer said colder is better...not always True.  Be friendlier.  Your mileage may vary, but the bartenders didn't seem nearly as friendly as the Hooters waitresses I'm used to.  I'm used to annoyingly friendly.  Something in between would be better.  No appetizer special for Happy Hour?  What?  Expand to Seattle.  It would be great marketing since the old Twin Peaks TV show took place in the Seattle area.",

    "text": "OK...  So, my friends and I used to go to Twin Peaks in Scottsdale.  It was fun, but it took 30 minutes to get there, so we didn't go very often.  The food was decent and the wait staff was friendly and able to get our orders correct.  It was also packed every day for lunch, which is generally a good sign.  So, imagine our reaction when a new TP opened up on Camelback!  Awesome!  My friends went there while I was out of town and said the food and service were awful.  Maybe they ordered wrong...  Maybe they had a bad server.  Who knows.  So, we went there last week, so I could do a \"quality check\".  There were 6 of us.  Everyone got their food at different times.  I ordered fish tacos, which was my go to choice at the Scottsdale location.  The first one was OK, the second one was bad.  I stopped eating after one bite.  At least at this time the server was nice and apologized for all the problems in the kitchen.  And today...  (You can see that I really gave this place a chance)  We had more people from out of town that wanted to go for a long lunch.  So, despite my friends original bad experience, and another one the week before, we decided to dare the peaks again.  Mistake.  One guy recommended wings as he had them at another TP and said they were \"decent\".  At this point, \"decent\" was all I was hoping for.  So, I ordered the wings.  Another person ordered grilled chicken strips.  Same usual fire drill.  Long wait for the food, and then everyone receives their meals at different times.  The waitress told my friend with the chicken strips, \"Don't worry, your chicken tacos will be out soon.\"  Um, that's not what I ordered...  I don't want to imagine what happened when she ran away from the table.    Well, the wings were awful.  I challenged myself to eat 3 of them (the most cooked looking ones I could see) and stole some fries from others.    When the grilled chicken strips finally arrived, they looked disgusting.  Like someone had microwaved some chicken strips and then tried to put some grill marks on them.  I told my friend not to eat them.  And then.  Oh, there's an and then?  Why yes there is.  The checks.  There were 8 of us.  One guy was paying for 3 people and everyone else was paying separately.  We do this almost daily without issue.  The waitress came back to the table about 4 times before everything was finally corrected and signed.    The one thing I will say, is that it doesn't seem to be the fault of the wait staff.  This place clearly suffers from BAD MANAGEMENT.  I will never go back.",

We usually wait a long time to even be seeing by a waitress. Last night I went with a couple of friends and it took the GIRL OF THE MONTH 30 minutes to take our drink order. We eventually had to grab someone walking by to assist us. Again, drinks took forever. Food took forever. We had to keep asking others for assistance. When we finally got our drinks we asked the waitress to take a picture of us. She did take a few but refused after and said \"I am not your photographer\". It took her 30 seconds to take the picture.   Service was awful the rest of the night we weren't event comfortable thinking that our food or drinks would have spit on them. We ended up spending close to $200-$300 on just drinks and it was just unbelievable of how little to no service we received. 3 of us were left after some of my friends left, the waitress came in to start picking up the plates to leave \"elbow room\" for us but made it quite clear she wanted us to leave. So I just said BYYYYEE! Never coming here again.",

Walking in was confusing - we came in from the patio, which is apparently the back of the restaurant.  so we had to walk through the entire thing to find the hostess station.  Once we did, it was empty.  a few moments later a woman came up and took us to a table.  It was really disconcerting trying to not stare at the amount of cleavage and thigh on display from everyone waltzing around the place -- or the # of dudes that were staring also.  was a little uncomfortable.  but the waitress we had was really nice.  Took drink orders...then we had our real waitress come up and ask for our drink orders..guess there was a mixup on who was supposed to take our table.  but we got drinks fairly quickly and placed our food order.  We had a buffalo chicken salad and a cheese burger and split them.  Food came out reasonably quickly and it was all really tasty and fresh.  I was concerned about ordering a salad at a place like this, but it was quiet good.    so 4 stars for food, 3 stars for having to be around 1/2 naked women which isn't my idea of a great restaurant.",

    "text": "The first thing you need to know (before you go here with your wife or daughter like I did) is that this is  a Tilted Kilt/Hooters kind of place. The girls wear skimpy uniforms and spend time flirting with customers. That is not something that would, by itself, draw me here.  But decent food, good beer selection and a sports bar atmosphere with plenty of TV's  is something I am definitely a sucker for.  Service was good. Audrey was our server. She was very friendly and we got our food lightning fast... so fast I barely had had time to take about four sips of my ice-cold HopShock IPA.  My burger was cooked to medium doneness as I ordered it. The fries were, no doubt, pulled from a bag in the freezer, so no points for fresh hand-cut fries here. They were cooked well but were slightly under-salted.  My daughter said her garlic parmesan wings were good but she's had better ones.  A manager did come over and said, \" I heard it was your first time here\" and gave us $5 coupons off our next visit. We don't live nearby, but if I'm  ever in the area again, I may return to take advantage of that discount.",

They didn't come back to re-fill our water or ask if we wanted drinks and we only received a re-fill on our water/were able to order drinks after we received our food. We had wings and the chicken quesadillas which were both delicious! The Jalapeno butter wings were a little weird but, still delicious. I'd recommend it, there are a ton of restaurants nearby where you can walk off the alcohol or food.",

Good enough selection of TV's and the happy hr drinks were awesome. $2.75 for a well drink is a pretty good deal, especially when served by one of the many very pretty servers who seem like they actually enjoy their job. Whether they do or not, I'm not sure, but if they don't, at least it didn't show. Chips and queso were really good, and quesadilla was too. So far, this chain has not disappointed and we will likely be back.",

Good service which is actually an oddity for these types of concepts.  I got Philly cheese steak with the jalapeno and queso option.  It was not just better than expected it was actually good.  Unfortunately the breastaurant concept just isn't my bag, but if I would definitely recommend this place over any others in the genre though.  That aside it is a cool bar and if the drinks were just a tad bit more reasonable I could actually see myself watching sports events here, but I understand the premium price for the concept so no hard feelings.",

For those of us not crazy about beer they have lots of great cocktails. We ordered queso dip with venison chili. It was great. The waitress was awesome. We changed our order a couple times and she was more than happy to oblige. She was very bubbly and started great conversation with us. What a rockstar. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Today was my first time going to this bar/restaurant. I arrived around 10:40PM  I liked the decor  inside and the view of the hot staff.  I was alone today due to my buddies bailing out on me at the last minute due to a family emergency.    I ordered a 22 ounce beer at the bar and looked over the menu.  So i finished looking over the menu and waited for the hot bartender to return to take my order. I waited for 15 minutes and i watched the bartender take a food order from a group sitting next to me. ???? I was very confused as to why the bartender was ignoring me.  I am not bad looking so i was confused. lol  The place was not busy, it was filled up 30%. not too busy for a friday night. If it was really busy I would then understand why the bartender was ignoring me. In a busy bar you have to yell and shout at the bartender to get their attention.     I then walked away from the bar to one of the tables, i expected i would get better service there. Nope, i was again ignored. lol     I then walked up to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to a female manager and explained to her about this situation. She apologized for the inconvenience and she gave me a discount for my meal.      I ordered the smokehouse burger with fries.    The burger arrived quickly.  The burger was just okay. It was not great.  It was greasy and under seasoned.    I would probably return to this place but not anytime soon. This place has great potential. Great decor, hot staff.  But food is sub par and the staff seems inexperienced.    I was going to give this place 4 stars for how hot the staff looked but alas, i could not with all honesty.",

I should have looked it up first, but I was enticed by the silly giant deer statue by the patio.   I was confused by the sign that offered a \"scenic view\" in the middle of a shopping center in Phoenix. As we parked, two large men, one looking like some sort of mafia bouncer, and another male employee were outside kind of yelling back and forth and swearing. My first thought was \"wow, it looks like going into a strip club\". And I was sort of right. Its like a lumberjack themed hooters.   The hostess was nice, lots of makeup, less of anything resembling clothing, because the women there are strippers with serving trays. (Except strippers make better money and don't get treated as shitty). We looked over the menu, and there was not an appealing option there. The food selection is limited, probably because most people go to drink and grope coeds.   Everyone male there looked crazy happy, and few women customers looked miserable. We waited a few minutes at our table and decided not to stay. It was too uncomfortable, we felt out of place, and the food options sucked. The managers or bouncers or whatever they were had this skeezy attitude when we walked by them. The waitresses and hostesses looked shocked that two women come in by themselves (since there weren't men there to convince us its \"because of the food\"). I felt a little bad leaving like that, I've worked at restaurants, I know what a pain it is when customers just up and leave, but if I want to pay for nearly naked women I'll go to a strip club.",

I feel like you can't miss the action.    Food here is pretty decent, I can't complain much except to say, it is...what it is...don't expect a fancy experience.  For the most part its your typical American fare at a pocket friendly cost.  Its definitely good for what it is and you're not breaking the bank.

I usually always get their chicken tender appetizer. It's cheap and filling. The nachos and mozzarella sticks are pretty good as well! The mozzarella sticks are square cubes that they batter daily. Even if that's a lie it taste great and not like the frozen traditional sticks you get at bars.",

My server's name was Sonia. She was very helpful, made me feel comfortable and took the time out to stop and hold a conversation with me. That is very rare at a lot of restaurants. The service was very attentive I never had to ask for a refill. My food was out quick. Plus every face in the building was friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. I personally will be back to order this billionaire bacon burger again. Maybe I can just order a full plate of that amazing bacon. LOL.",

    "text": "Being the Towne & Country Center during a weekend during a peak hour, the parking was kind of scarce. Later on, that clears up.   We went inside and were seated immediately...I asked for a booth and we received a booth. There was plenty of seating available. I guess they weren't that super busy. The waitress said that they get really busy during fight nights and such...makes sense.   Girls: Cute Clothes: Scantily clad Satisfaction: Decent  The place was quite cavernous inside. It kind of seemed like it was decorated by whoever decorates Cabela's to be honest. I didn't mind. There was also flat panel LCD TVs everywhere. Also, there were small 15\" TVs on each booth. Quite convenient.   Now, as far as the food and service. It was stated that the happy hour was from 4-7PM. It's like $2 off draft beer and appetizers, if I remember correctly. I asked for the chicken tenders and chips and dip since I already ate pizza beforehand. I got a Angry Orchard since when I rarely drink beer, I prefer a cider for the crisp, sweet taste. Friend got a hangover burger for his hangover.   The food came relatively fast. It was a few minutes for the beer, another 10 minutes or so for the appetizers, and then another 5 minutes after that for the burger. The burger was good he said. I ate the chicken tenders, fries, chips and cheese dip and they were very good. The cheese solidified quite fast though.   The service wasn't bad. Wasn't great either though. Our waitress seemed like she tried her best but didn't come around as much as I figured she would. We were there for like an hour and a half and she came around like 3-4 times even though there wasn't many customers. In any which case, the bill came and it was like $23 for two people. I figured that wasn't that bad.  I wouldn't mind coming back here again but more than likely it would have to be happy hour again.",

The girls are HOT and were all wearing tiny variations of Santa and elf costumes. They were all very sweet and friendly, explained the menu offered to let us sample beers.  ( this was my first time there )    I'm absolutely in LOVE with their beer Dirty Blonde, it's a great Hefe with just enough sweetness to it. They are serious about their beer being COLD ! 29 F to be exact,  I can't wait to come back in the middle of the summer.  That beer is going to be sooooooo good on a 115 degree day.    I had the green chile meatloaf with mac and cheese.  Also a quesadilla with chili . Both were really good, not your typical bar food.  The service was great throughout and we had a terrific time.  They have stolen me away from Tilted Kilt forever !!",

Food was really good and the beer will kick u with a good buzz. No matter what the reviews say, families are welcome. Beautiful ladies and sports!  THE BAD:  Even though I get why, the service took pretty long. Good if you chill and drink but not if you want to eat and take off.   All N All, I would recommend this spot!  Erica was our host and she was awesome.  She took special care of our 93yr young grandma. Very beautiful girl. THANK YOU ERICA!!!",

Even the male patrons thought the night time, child like bartender that was working was out of line. Too bad! You just lost a local patron today plus multiple friends in the area.

Our servers name was Ana, and she was incredibly nice and personable. It was apparent that it was a slow night, but there was still a decent amount of people there. It had to have been no more than 20-30 minutes of us arriving that a verbal alteration was going on between the manager (Chris I believe), and a sketchy looking character that was drinking only water.  I was looking directly at the altercation a few tables away, but couldn't hear what had been said. Chris appeared to be talking to this gentlemen in a very professional manner and as he walked away this individual proceeded to yell at him from across the restuarant. It wasn't clear to anyone what exactly was going on but this individual continued to yell at Chris and walked towards the kitchen. It appeared that this situation was going to get violent.  Within a matter of minutes, Chris and the Twin Peaks staff escorted this individual out of the restuarant and assured everyone that the police had been called.   I've never experienced something like this in a restaurant, but I feel that it couldn't have been handled anymore perfectly. I just wanted say thank you to Chris for the professionalism, Ana for the above and beyond service, and all of the Twin Peaks staff for rolling with the punches and continuing to provide top notch service!",

Ordered the sampler and enjoyed the mozzarella bites it also has buffalo fingers and fried pickles and got boneless wings to go. I ordered a $12!!! Filthy martini which was on the drink menu. I'm excited for any place that actually puts that on a drink menu but then they brought it out and I was instantly disappointed. I thought it must be a joke. They must have run out of clean martini glasses because they brought it to me in a wine/water/tumbler glass making it look like someone already drank half and Who does that? Was it because it's a male targeted establishment that you don't want to serve a martini in a martini glass or was this a bar tender unable to find a clean martini glass? So strange to me and no way worth $12! Couldn't help but feel ripped off. Had to YELP this and took the pic to show this oddity. Gave two stars instead of one because I found the atmosphere nice. They allowed dogs on the patio. The girls in daisy dukes isn't original btw but I get it....",

Went there after eating dinner at the Parlor - it was pretty empty at around 10pm on a Friday night - not sure why.  Service was good as we only ordered drinks.  I've been to Twin Peaks in Dallas during a peak time and the experience was great - similar to my experience with Tilted Kilt.  Not exactly the same with this experience but willing to give it a second chance in the future.",

First the good points:  - Servers are friendly and attractive (let's be honest- that's why we're here) - Beer was served so cold there was a small iceberg floating on top - Pretzel and cheese appetizer was very tasty  Now for the rest...  - No vegetarian friendly entrees - So many TV screens we felt like we were in an SNL parody sketch depicting a sports bar - Stuffed dead animals everywhere.  Again- not a vegetarian friendly establishment. - Salsa served with the chips was warm- not room temperature but actually heated up, while the mustard served with the pretzel was cold.  Not really worth complaining about, but the warm salsa was weird.  Overall, this place just did not suit us.  The decor wanted to be hunting lodge rustic but the ridiculous number of TV's did not match that vibe.  I think we'll stick with Tilted Kilt- they have equally attractive servers, but also offer veggie pizza, veggie wrap, and a black bean patty to substitute in the hamburgers.  Oh- and no dead coyotes watching me drink my beer.",

After we were served and given our bill, I gave my server a $20 bill. My bill was $8, but given back $6 as change. But that's not the math. When I let my server know she took the folder and walked over to the cash register and \"fiddled\" around with the change and didn't apologize or speak to me about the mixup, and only spoke to me as I was leaving. I can't help but feel like she was trying to steal from me. It has nothing to do with the amount of money, but the principle of it.  I hope you guys rethink who you have working for you, if your server continues to do that, which I am sure has happened before me, you will lose much more than business.",

Eventually another waitress grab them and deliver them to us followed by our food. We finish her food and we finished our beers and we sat there for over 20 minutes waiting for a waitress to come by again. It was almost a joke as to how many times we watched her and counted her go to the tables around us. Several times she just walked by our table and did not acknowledge us.

The manager Chris has a thing or two to learn about keeping customers, and he had the nerve to preach to me about ethics? Come on, moral high ground? With all due respect to the hard working staff, your business thrives on objectifying women and you make money off of the base instincts in men, not to mention rating your employees by appearance, who are you trying to kid? After this experience I will never give this location another dime of my hard earned money. But Chris wouldn't care because according to him he'd rather lose a long time customer just to turn one of his new customers into a regular. What a joke of an ideal for a store manager. What are you going to do when you turn that customer into a regular Chris? Send him away too? Consider a career change buddy.",

The restaurant was very fast with our take out order as they had it ready in 10 min! On a Friday night at that!   Saw other things on the menu I can't wait to try, will definitely be back.",

Now the bad news: another \"breastraunt\" where the chick bartenders can't stop f-ing with their hair...and then handling fruit for drinks and plates of food!  DISGUSTING!

She brought our cold burger and nachos with coagulated cheese and ice cold meat, never saw her for another ten minutes to even tell her what was wrong. Two of us sat, and she brought one place setting. After I asked for the bill again waiting forever, she asked if I could use anything, I asked for a napkin, she brought me a paper square bar napkin and laughed. And this comedy of errors was only half of what I will discuss.",

I could taste the beer in it. I also had a turkey avocado sandwich which had plenty of meat and was also very good. The sweet potato fries were nice and crisp but a little too salty. Otherwise they would have been perfect. Our table was a bit dirty, some dried up wing sauce on the top and the plates they left on the table for sharing had a large hunk of sauce dried on it. Our server was very nice. The doors in the ladies bathroom stalls wouldn't latch.

From jalapeno gravy, to a Texas version of a Philly, they took standard bar food and kicked it up a notch.  I have been to the original Twin Peaks, and I've got to say this one has potential. The food was on point, the waitresses seemed involved, and my beer was never empty. The manager ecen came by to see how I was doing. That's always a big plus. I did notice the occasional employee \"lost in the sauce\", but with a new place, it's to be expected. My only confusion was that the entrance was towards the back of the building instead of the front, where most of the shoppers in the shopping area would be. Be prepared for an Americanized beer service, meaning- the colder and sloppier the better. It's just part of how they do things. I spent six years in Europe, and while, no, it's not proper, it doesn't bother me in the least.",

Third apparently the word i want to use i cant ill just refer to them as kids because they act like retarded gang bangers. Me i am a veteran and we were here way before these kids even sat down they got served first and even got drink and food orders before we did. Fourth the girl who took our orders interrupt to go serve them in the middle of our order so un professional. Then so couldnt even remember a simple order of a beer and some chip and dip. I wouldnt recommend anyone coming here i would of been better off at a food truck at least there better personality there than this place i always heard good things here but after this experience i would not be coming back i love there beer but does not excuse horrible service stuck up girls and server favorite getting served first soo everybody stay away go find something better isn't the whole point we go out to eat for the experience hope this helps everybody who is wonder about coming here go to the rey del tortas soo much better then this dump",

Our table was never called and if they had let us know that we would never get a table I would of never paid the $5 dollars to watch the game. We  would of just went somewhere else. To make up for this they gave us a coupon for an appetizer in which we would have to go back and pay for entree. Such a great deal!! Never got to eat dinner let alone even get a drink.

We knew the atmosphere of the restaurant was skimpy girls and we didn't care we wanted to go for the experience and to try a new place. We walked in and the hostess seated 2 small groups of gentlemen right in front of us. We arrived at the hostess stand and the hostess told me it would be a 2 hour wait.. 2 HOUR.. as I looked around at the EMPTY waiting area I was confused and just assumed she had a brain fart. She took my number and I sat in the waiting area. Next a group of unattractive men walked in and as they approached the stand the hostess told them 30 minutes after she rolled her eyes as the group approached. Now I am not making assumptions but it looked like she was judging the group. The group of men left and as they left the hostesses giggled in each others ear as they headed out. 10 minutes into waiting a nice looking group of males walking in and were seated right away. At least point I didn't even want to spend my money on this pace. Attitude is everything in a business and the girls you hire with big pushups bras that are fresh out of high school clearly don't understand what customer service is. Will never return",

This isn't the normal recipe but still really good! I also ordered the fish and chips. I didn't expect much from this place, especially at almost midnight. The food was actually really good and flavorful! The fish was well prepared and didn't need any condiments to help with flavor. There was also the show  apparently there was a working girl there harassing some drunk guy trying to get him to pay for her \"services\" he wasn't having it part of it but it was entertaining to watch, there was also the drunk dude at the next table over that was soooo smashed he fell off of his counter height stool. My party enjoyed the food and festivities! Definitely something to remember! Scottsdale is a nice little town and this place was a great introduction!",

My hostess/waitress, Laken was polite, and professional. She took me to my booth. Now, either the benches are too low, or the table is too high, as the table top came even with my upper chest. She gave me the menus, and asked if I would like a drink. Since, I had a good drive ahead of me, I passed, and she gave me plenty of time to look over the menus.   I really liked the rustic appearance of the place. Though, I found it amusing, having the waitresses wearing \"diamond\" necklaces was out of place with the shorts, halter tops, knee-high socks and \"boots\" that make up their uniform.  I ordered the Beer Battered Fish and Chips, and that was brought to me by another waitress. And I must say, that the food was pretty tasty. The natural cut seasoned fries were hot (though, they cooled pretty quickly since they were spread out on the plate under the fish). But, the fish was piping hot! From the first bite, to the last (4 pieces later; was too full to get the last piece), the fish was hot. Might be a bit greasy for some people, but I really liked it.  However, like Benjamin B., I too noticed where the waitresses (sometimes 2 at a time), would be chatting with customers (regulars, I think, since the guys was much older than the girls) at other tables, whereas my conversation was limited to the basic order, meal check and check. Though, the hand written note was nice to see.  I'll be back.",

I do like the vibe of the place and it does have a family appeal aspect too. The outfits are cute but not overbearing .  The service here was good and all of the staff friendly. That was par for the course and met my expectations. It is next to Colonade Mall and has tons of stores to experience and coffee shops too. Good location as well.  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #Irishcatv2",

Personally I tend to judge an establishment by the little details that seem to fall to the wayside with the majority of mainstream eateries / sports bar and grills. The food is always served promptly and fresh, never held under warming lights until it's all dried out and nasty, and we all have experienced that. The drinks are always refreshed quickly and done with a professionalism that I would only associated with 5 star high end establishments. Way to go Peaks... this is truly a go to spot.",

Little did I know that the waitresses here dress very sek-say. I was immediately uncomfortable once I walked in  Because I only saw a bunch of male customers. My shuttle driver should have mentioned this to me since he knew I was eating in the area. No worries though. The hostess and my waitress were both really nice. The girls were all wearing tiny flannel tops and extremely short jean shorts. Not one of them had an ounce of fat on their body so if you like that kind of thing,  you'll love this place.   The food here was absolutely awesome. I ordered the smoked chicken wings for 10.50. They were sooooo good. My waitress also allowed me to samples three of the sauces. The garlic parmesan sauce wasn't bad at all even though she said that it was really garlicky. The classic sauce was really spicy and I didn't try the jalapeno butter sauce  because it just didn't look appetizing.  This place has a great sports bar atmosphere with tons of TV's. Service was great. I don't remember the server's name but she had long pretty blonde hair.",

There are sports TV\"s EVERYWHERE, which is amazing, but also a very cool rustic cowboy theme that is really fun.  As for the beer, they had a nice selection, best bet is the \"Manly size\" (more bank for your buck - plus all those cute girls there will look at you funny if you roll up for the \"woman's beer\" as they call it.

She had drink orders in for us before we even looked at the menus which is in heard of for a party our size!  We rate on four areas: 1. Atmosphere: plenty of seating with numerous TVs playing various programs, they even TVs in the booths! This is a sports bar with waitresses dressed like sexy lumberjacks. This place was fun with a really cool vibe.  2. Food: Don't be fooled into thinking this is just bar food! The food is actually really really good. The menu was diverse with items on it that you don't typically see at a sports bar. You must get a beer! It's the coldest I've ever had!  3. Service: I was amazed with the service considering the size of our party. My drink never went empty before she ordered me another. Thank you Nicole!  4. Other observations: the parking is confusing. The front door is on the backside of the building where there is another parking lot that we didn't even know was there. They have really cool sinks in the bathrooms.   Overall great place and I would definitely recommend it!!!",

The fries were cold and weren't that good.  You come here to watch sports though not for the food. It was a very rainy and cold day so there weren't many people there for NFL games.

Maybe in California we're just use to better service. Huge let down considering the AWESOME potential this place has!At the same time I am thankful we had somewhere to watch our USC game this weekend while we're in town for the saints game.  Adding on to this review 16 days later to notice the owner tried contacting me on here to better his restaurant and I think that is awesome!

Yes, the eye candy here is what makes the place but there should be some regard to service as well. Yes we went during a Cardinals MNF game but got there before it started. Our server had no clue how to describe even the two house beers or anything about it. She just knows the canned response about would you like to try brunette or blonde and would you like to start off with an appetizer. If those are the things you are promoting be able to describe it! Right?  She didn't know what wines were available didn't know which ones on her cheat sheet were red or white.I get it, most fellas don't come here for wine but if you are a server expect people to order wine. After the drink order is placed a girl brings the wine and truly ten minutes later when I ask about my beer she tells me bar is backed up and thats why I havent got my beer? So did the wine not come from the bar? When the third girl comes with the beer she guesses two random tables before getting to me. While on the patio that happened to two other tables different girls for different order items could never get it right. Both times third try was the charm..   We ordered the chicken tender basket(reasonably priced ) realy liked the honey mustard. No ketchup at the table and no plates. I ask for plates ketchup and Tabasco from the girl who brought out food(not our server) . We never see her again.  When our server comes back I ask for all three she later comes back with 2 of 3. My patience is being tested but I tell myself I don't need Tabasco because by the time she brings it my fries will be done.   I see a guy nearby who also was waiting on a beer for sometime when a manager comes by and does his table check he apologizes brings him the beer and comps it.   This was yesterday when it was really muggy after our record rainfall but they didnt think to turn on the awesome mister thing they have until almost halftime. Life would have been so much more pleasant if those were on earlier. Also, they kept trying to time the commercials to play music but started off with some horrible 80's music during commercials but they were constantly off on when they cut the music and came back to game sound. Whats the big deal with letting the commercials play through?  In a nutshell if you are coming here just to watch sports and admire the female shape you are in a good place.   If you want decent service and the female shape on display  try Tilted Kilt or Hooters. Best of both worlds.",

Douchey bro clientele, angry albeit attractive waitresses who don't want to actually work for their tips, and high prices. Also: BLARINGLY loud music to keep the conversation at a minimum and the drinking to a maximum.  Blech.",

The menu is pretty limited but they serve late, so I enjoyed yummy fried mozzarella bites, grilled trout and a side salad, washed down by a dirty blonde. Everything was good-not GREAT but good value for what you get in my opinion.  AND I got a happy hour prices on the mozzarella bites and my dirty blonde.  There are tons of tvs so this is great place to catch your favorite sports game. The talent here is FAR superior than either Tilted Kilt or Hooters (even when school is in session). The talent working on this particular wren beautiful and very warm and funny so this is not a bad place to check out by any means.",

Great recommendations on beer and food and really knew her stuff when it came to the beer menu for my father who was not a beer person.   Burger was typical berger you can get anyplace. Fries were good but the ICED COLD BEER stole it. Love how they keep it so cold so that it can be enjoyed just that much longer before you have to start to chug it so it doesn't get too warm, especially in the AZ heat.",

I'm not the type to go to a hooters or tilted-kilt (which we do have in my home city) so this isn't necessarily a place I would have chosen for its scenery.  Despite its obvious angle to draw in customers the food is actually pretty good. Their cheese bites are shaped kind of like tater-tots which makes them less unwieldy than normal cheese sticks, in turn making them easier to dip. Their is something very satisfying about eating tot-sized melted cheese deliciousness. I also had a \"billionaires burger\" or some such thing which was pretty good as well.   Even better was the service.   My waitress was Kim. Kim is attractive on a level that is almost mind-numbing, but she was also legitimately one of the best waitresses I've ever had.   When I went I figured I'd sit quietly in a corner, eat, and go back to work but Kim came over and hung out, talking to me during most of my lunch. I get that it's the waitress' job to be friendly but I feel like Kim went way past the normal pleasantness to make sure I had a great time while I was there.  I see that it looks like the owner replies to these reviews, which is cool.   I took the time to let the manager know that Kim was awesome after my lunch was up so hopefully you guys do something for your servers who offer a genuinely great customer experience. If not you seriously need to do something to reward her level of service.",

But to have three bartenders walk by several times, without even saying hello or I will be with you shortly, is terrible service.   I tired of waiting, so I stood up to walk away, and then was acknowledged by one of the bartenders to have a nice day.  I commented back that I was never served and that maybe I will have a nice day at another restaurant.  Was told to have a nice day at the door while leaving.  I said I couldn't get service.

    "text": "Okay, I know what you're probably thinking.  Five stars for a sports bar?  I must be one of those \"superbro\" types.  I am certainly a sports fan, but I can assure you I very seldom frequent sports bars.  Typically because the food is terrible, the noise level is over the top, or the service sucks (see my review of Half Moon).  Or perhaps you're thinking I'm one of those dudes that gets starry eyed by female waitresses in skimpy outfits.  And sure, I (generally speaking) find women attractive, but pretty girls alone aren't what gets me out to a restaurant.  Whether its a sports bar, a regular sit down restaurant, a food truck or whatever, I usually only give high marks (and recommend return trips) to establishments that deliver a quality experience.  Great food, great service and great atmosphere are all necessary to get high marks in my book.  If I came here more frequently, perhaps my feelings on this place would moderate a bit.  But tonight was surprisingly awesome on a number of fronts.  Most shockingly, the food.  Twin Peaks has locations all over the country, but tonight was my first time coming here.  I was invited to meet up with some guy friends here to watch a college football game (it also just happened to be UFC fight night).  I agreed, but my expectations of the place were pretty low.  This location is set back in the corner of a shopping complex on the southeast corner of 20th Street and Camelback.  Be sure to park south of the restaurant as parking north of there can be a chore.  As the restaurant's name sake suggests, the restaurant's look resembles that of a high country hangout.  The interior looks like a giant expansive cabin that just so happens to have a sports bar inside.  The place is remarkably clean and well put together for a sports bar almost to the point of being refined.  Theres a ton of seating and TVs as you'd expect.  And there's also a sizable outdoor patio with plenty of TVs to boot.  This place is truly built for big events (NFL, UFC, etc).  At first glance, the menu isn't anything impressive.  Sure, there's burgers, salads, various appetizers that you would expect.  But one item in particular caught my eye.  They prominently advertise a pot roast dinner that includes potatoes, green beans, carrots, and a pot roast smothered in gravy.  All in a cast iron skillet.  I figured why not.  Again, my expectations were low, but my attitude about this place changed instantly with that first bite.  The pot roast itself was insanely tender meat that cut easily with a fork.  The veggies were blanched just right and soaked up that delicious gravy beautifully.  And those lightly seasoned, thick cut potatoes were also a delicious accompaniment.  Seriously, there isn't a single thing I would've changed about this dish.  I was so impressed, I figured I'd give one of their desserts a try.  So I went with a blonde brownie topped with two scoops of ice cream, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream.  Again, a solid dish.  A soft warm brownie filled with nuts and topped with two very generous scoops of vanilla.  Really meant to be shared, but I took care of it on my own since no one else wanted dessert.  Our server Lindsay was extremely friendly, professional, and attentive to us even with a packed house full of football and UFC fans.  She came by no less than once every 5 minutes to check on us and refill our drinks.  Also, the manager was nice enough to give us a pass on paying the usual $5 UFC night cover charge, asking only that we tipped our waitress generously (which was fine as she certainly earned it).  All totaled the final price for my pot roast dinner, brownie, two beers, tax and tip came out to $40.  Given the portions and the quality of the food, it was money well spent.  We had a great time watching the game and even partook in UFC watching for the evening.  I can't speak for the other Twin Peaks locations, but this particular location exceeded all my expectations for the evening.  If I need a go-to sports bar with the guys in the future, this place will be right at the top of my list.",

Service was excellent but the food was disappointing. Obviously, no one comes here for the food but with so many dining options near the Biltmore, its a waste to try any food here. We had the sliders, chicken fingers and Cobb Salad. (All were sub-par)     Tilted Kilt is miles ahead of Twin Peaks with better atmosphere and food. I'd even say Hooters is superior. I'm not a fan of the Cold Beer gimmick or Shot-skis but maybe I'm just getting old. Who's down for Sizzler, next time?",

It was happy hour, I split the cost of nachos which were eh with a small amount of toppings, got a beer and 2 shots. I remember signing off on a bill for 24 dollars and change. Come to look at my credit card statement, and it says I paid 42. So apparently the punk waitresses think it's cool to tip themselves 20 bucks. Never again and if you do bother coming here, make sure you take a picture of your sign off. The most dishonest and rude thing I've ever had done to me in any restaurant.",

The rest of the party ordered a variety of food items, which were a step above McDonalds. The waitresses were so so slow at bringing drinks, food and the checks. I never did get a water. Terrible, terrible customer service  The ladies were too worried about chatting it up with the single men at the bar area, then servicing our party. 2 waitresses and had to physically go get someone to help us. Very disappointed with this establishment.Waitresses acted like this was a strip club versus a place where all ages can go with or without families. Only place open late after graduation.. None of my party of people will be returning ever again .",

    "text": "I have gone here 3x in the past week and certain situations have been so frustrating. The first visit was good. The waitress was attentive and really helped. The second visit (fight night) made me really angry and question if I would be back. First off we had a party of 3 we were about to be seated then were told they wouldn't seat us until all 3 of us are there. Since we knew the other person wouldn't arrive for hours we said nvm just a party of 2. She immediately says \"well we don't have a two top right now\" we decided to sit at the bar until they had something available and guess what... the people who walked in 4 minutes after us (two men) got seated right away at the table I had requested in the beginning. Already annoyed I let it go.   Our waitress came by and made an amazing recommendation on what to try from the menu and it did not disappoint. I thanked her a million times. The problem happened when she had someone walk out on their tab. They requested we put a card on file. No big deal. HOWEVER she charged us for the person who walked out. She corrected it (at least she said she did) and now I'm showing 5 separate amounts on my bank statement and I'm hoping they are just holds and twin peaks will correct it.   My next issue came yesterday. We sat at a table and had to wait a pretty long time for the waitress to come by. Someone finally did and we ordered our drinks. 3 waters 2 beers and a tequila shot (3 of us at the table) our alcohol came out but no water.  A second person came by and I again asked for 3 waters. 20 min later I had to get up and go to the hostess stand and ask if someone could please get our water. She immediately got it for us and apologized. She was sweet. The waitress then came by and asked us if we wanted to order. We did. I asked 3x for the spicy tai sauce and never got it. I just gave up at this point.   Being there to celebrate a birthday for a friend I'm really reconsidering taking 15 people there on Friday to celebrate mine if they can't handle 3.    On the bright side the manager did get us a round of drinks. He was extremely friendly. I couldn't just continue to complain. I just wanted to enjoy my meal and celebrate a friends birthday.   What a bummer.",

The first time we tried it, the server was very sweet and personable, but messed up our order more than once. We asked for unsweetened tea, received sweet tea (not only once, but three times), I asked for a different type of cheese on my billionaire burger, and received the pimento cheese. Granted, it was busy, (around 1pm), but it took them awhile to get our food out and trying to get the servers attention to assist us was not easy.  A couple weeks later, we decided to try it again (this was today)  and we brought friends with us. It was my husbands birthday, and chalked our last experience up to a busy day and less-than-stellar employee. We had a different server, but both of them apparently attended the same school--very sweet and pleasant, but not so great on customer service and attention to detail. Today, the place pretty empty, yet We still had to chase her down for condiments that we had previously asked for, our friend's French fries were ice cold, we had to track her down for drink refills, etc.  I asked about birthday rewards and she told us that we needed to sign up to get them. When I told her that we had the last time we were in, she said then we should have received a coupon to bring in, but she could take our picture..... I can take my own picture, thank you. I don't think our friends will be returning, and even though the food was good, there are many other establishments that have equally good food, but with service to match, so we probably won't be returning either.",

There is nothing wrong with Twin Peaks but nothing excels at this place is.   It's exactly what you expect to get out of a restaurant like this when you decide to go.  The one thing I will give them credit for is they are pretty on top of things on fight nights (was there for the recent Rousey fight to watch my future wife get another win) and I don't feel like they under deliver for those. They have a plan and execute and food and drinks come at right about the pace you would expect for a busy place if not even a little faster. Also did a good job handling split checks.",

Well, they brought me a 13 oz ribeye steak with asparagus. When I informed the waitress that this wasn't what I ordered she apologized and took it back. I give her that, she was very polite. The manager, Omar, came back and said he would charge me for the price of the ribeye steak instead of the sirloin. So me, being the kind hearted person that I am, said okay because I felt bad if they had to waste a perfectly good steak, but I also asked for some mashed potatoes because I don't care for asparagus. Long story short, I wish I would've just sent back the steak because he ended up charging me for the sirloin anyways. Overall the steak was okay, it had a lot of fat though. Just make sure you have the waitress repeat your order back to you to make sure you are getting what you order. Lesson learned.",

So I am not sure what is going on in here...I mean if you like to watch sports in a bar...yea...they got that going for them, that and Ice Cold cheap tap beer that's why they get two stars.  Not really anything on the menu that is very healthy, If you want straight junk bar food than yea they got that too....the decor makes no sense, you got girls wearing next to nothing, Ugg boots, and then have a bunch of taxidermy on the walls...not sure what the hell is going on in here. And god help the lighting...its like walking into the sun, I assume they do this so the middle aged perverts that frequent this place don't try to get handsy with the barely legal waitresses.  And this place is over priced, besides the bar, everything here is about $2 $3 more expensive then most other places serving the same menu items and the quality is generally shit.    I would go here to watch a game once in a while, but most game days, there is a line out the door. And for special events like fight night they want to charge a cover to get in like there a god damn night club. Ridiculous.",

On top of that, we were a big party (meaning we would leave a huge tip regardless). Despite that, we were hardly attended. They were more occupied chatting with guys at surrounding tables. And yes, we were a huge group of mostly girls, however we should have been attended more frequently. I was really hoping it didn't have that \"Hooters male service first only\" stigma but it did. The only other place I haven't experienced that is at the Tilted Kilt downtown (props to that place).  Anyways, I would not recommend this place. Go to Tilted Kilt instead.",

The girls behind the bar were not friendly, and seemed to have a select clientele sitting around the bar area. We were clearly older and not the type they preferred to wait on. We ordered a beer and looked over the menu! Had to have the billionaire bacon-it's amazing and something we just have to ace every time! After receiving that we were not checked on again by the bar staff. The manager came around and talked to us-he was extremely nice-social, and honestly should teach his bar staff to do the same. The ladies really lacked people skills-and seemed they rely entirely on their looks to the job, which is unfortunate-considering I like a great personality, and I like to be treated like a regular even if it's my first time.  I also CANNOT STAND people in the service industry touching and playing with their hair! Even if you just serve drinks and bring food-I'm a barber-hair has a way of getting everywhere, and in a restaurant it should be kept to a minimum!  Almost every girl we saw in there were grooming their hair and then touching plates of food! I'm sorry, but that is gross! Put it in a ponytail- DONT TOUCH YOUR HAIR IN A RESTAURANT!  We decided not to stay for dinner as planned, and went on to somewhere else.  To sum it up-service was terribly lacking, the personal grooming, and being ignored is the reason we won't be back.  The good - the bacon! The blonde and brunette beers are always delicious, and the atmosphere is fun like all other locations!",

We had the new Korean volcano wings and let me tell you if you like habanero, well this is one set of wings for you. They were super spicy yet very flavorful and their wings are smoked on a smoker so it was like different layers of flavorful. I also had there sweet BBQ Burger and it was very tasty and my husband hair the billionaire Burger. The burgers come with fries. I was left wanting they're bacon, apparently they are known for their bacon and since it was a football Sunday they happened to run out of their famous bacon by the time I ordered food which was 11 pm, so I got regular bacon on my burger.  Service was great especially since it was late Sunday night pretty empty. Megan was our server and she is very knowledgeable and very kind. Definitely will be coming back again.   The only thing I would change is that they do not have a late happy hour so our dinner was pretty pricey.  Lastly, their beers are served very chill!",

It is huge inside. TVs everywhere. Tiger had just won The Masters and the place was kinda empty. The host sat us immediately and took our drink orders.  They informed us of the happy hour drinks and appetizers.  It was around 5pm on a Sunday. Happy hour? We'll take it. $5.99 Margarita.  We ordered an appetizer, guacamole and chips.  Very good. The chips were lightly salted and thin crispy mexican style. The guac was plentiful and thick.   I ordered korean volano wings. Nice and tingly and scoville-rated pretty hot.  The nashville hot wasn't that hot.  Since i ordered 12 they split the flavors,6&6 all flats! (Bonus)  My girlfiend ordered a burger and it canout quick but under cooked.  No problem. They apologized and cooked her another burger.  Great service and staff. No one was standing around shooting the breeze. Everyone appeared engaged in the customers.  I am comi g back.",

My daughter and I came in at 3 o'clock which is typically the worst time to go to a restaurant because of the quality of food and service, due to shift change but today Twin Peaks proved this wrong. I had a Philly cheesesteak sandwich with Cajun spiced french fries which the server Kimberly suggested that's not on menu. I told her I like spicy food, so good! My daughter had  the chicken fingers they were fresh  and seasoned well. Kimberly was very attentive with a great personality. Restaurant was clean music wasn't too loud very nice late lunch atmosphere.",

Zoe came to the table with an attitude. I should have listened to my friends when they said the girls at this location have THE worst attitude!",

    "text": "First and last visit! I'm not too happy about having to give this place 1 star because the food was soooo good here, but the service was the worse service I have ever had and for that I will not be back. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and had about 15 people in our group. When we got there it took about 10-15 minutes before the server came to get our drink order. It was not busy! When she came back with our drinks we asked for a couple of waters. After asking multiple times throughout the evening, we still never got our waters.  At one point we had ordered a small round of shots and it took about 5 or more mins for her to understand the order. She didn't know half of the alcohols we were ordering and we were ordering alcohols off the $3.99 shot menu. If it's a special promotion I expect the server to be familiar with them. When she got to the table with the shots, she was unable to tell us which shot was which. She literally had us guess what was what! And she did this with two different rounds.  Now fast forward to the end of the evening when we each got our checks..... every single check was incorrect! It took her 3 tries to correct my check and by the end she still over charged me and other guest. By this point I was so frustrated I didn't even care about the overpayment and just wanted to leave and get on with our evening. So we paid our bills and left. As I said at the beginning of the review, after an experience like this, I will not be back.",

They have signs showing the temp of the coolers which is interesting to me. Needless to say, the beer was good and cold. The only thing I would like to see is more local micro brews. Now the food.  I ordered my burger medium and it came out as such. It looked to be a quarter pound, possibly 1/3 lb. cooked perfectly. The candied bacon had a nice spice to it, and the cheese and sauce had good flavor as well. The only down side for me is I don't care for shredded lettuce on my burgers. But that's my preference. The fries are phenomenal. Crispy on the out side, soft in the inside. Ketchup ? Not needed at all, why kill that flavor? Salt and pepper is fresh ground at the table via grinders. My son had the boneless chicken wings and he said they were excellent. Brother has fish and chips and he said the same  The atmosphere is kind of rustic cabin with TVs abound with just about every sport playing. I don't think you'll regret eating here.",

Not that I minded at all, but it was just a little funny (and uncomfortable) when I walked in here with my friend who was here from out of town & staying at a hotel close by. I suggested this place not knowing anything about it, and yes, I blushed when we walked in.   This place is pretty solid, though. Both the food and service were good. We came in right as HH was ending, so we didn't get to take advantage of that, but I know they have drink specials & I believe food specials as well.   I've always said that I'm a sucker for cheesy theme bars/restaurants so I liked that whole \"lodge\" vibe at Twin Peaks.   As far as food goes I had the fish tacos and they were solid. They give you a ton of food here. I had three tacos that came w/chips & salsa. They tacos had a bit of kick to them, but were tasty. We also split an order of queso dip, which was yummy.  At the end of the day Twin Peaks is a pretty solid restaurant. It's different than most other places in this area and I'm a fan.",

It kept dwelling on me. So I ordered the queso and a lemonade. The queso was too salty. So there goes 3 stars. I'm done. Maybe next time it'll get better.  And if u need a bouncer I'm available.",

Everybody in front of the house  always says hello  that's including the bussers.The Management and ownership is top notch. However, the back of the house (cooks/kitchen) has done an outstanding job as well. The fresh food that comes out of the kitchen is amazing, it's not your typical sports bar food. I have quite a few favorites that are on the menu but if you are just looking for a burger TP has  a new patty that  I recommend to be cooked at a  medium rare and it just melts in your mouth. If a  burger or red meat isn't what you're looking for they have  a beautiful  season  fresh trout. The fresh trout is cooked to perfection. But not only the food is excellent the beer is nice and cold 29 degrees to be exact and they have plenty on tap even some seasonals. Now if it sports you want you are definitely going to get it.  TP  has TVs all over so you can watch from any angle. They even have them on the patio.  TP offer  hear TV  so you can put on your headphones then connect the sound too your smartphone so you can listen to any TV. So all in all  they offer Great Beer,  great customer service, great food, and great overall experience. Special thanks to all TP staff and franchise owners keep up the good work.",

To start our waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there in the first place and while we were very nice she continued to have rude and dismissive attitude as if she didn't want to be bothered. My boyfriend ordered a burger with grilled onions and fries and I ordered a salad. My salad was mediocre can't really mess it up. When our food arrived my boyfriend look at his burger and there was two slivers on grilled onion, barely any. So we thought its ok no big deal we will just ask for more. We told our waitress about the situation and I think she took it personally. Brought back a cup of grilled onions with the worst attitude. It was unbelievable. Apparently she was so offended she told her manger to come and talk to us. He said \"Was there a problem with your food?\" And by this time we were annoyed and told him \"Yeah we ordered grilled onions on his burger and there was barely any on there, we just wanted grilled onions.\" And I could not believe it but the MANGER SAID \"Well you know, it's a restaurant, it's cheap. Maybe next time you should just say you want extra onions.\" THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. The manger is an idiot and should be fired. We have never gone back and we never will.",

She was very nice and you could tell that everyone loved her. She like the server did told us about the upcoming events and invited us back.

I didn't really expect too much from the food being that it is a sports bar after all, but thought it was pretty good   The reason for the 2 star review was that for some reason management seemed to have yanked all of the servers off of the floor for some kind of meeting in the kitchen which was noticed by everyone in our section of the restaurant.  We ordered more beers prior to all of this, which after 15 minutes and having finished all of our food, we opted for a water which also took an additional 10-15 more minutes.   It was by no means a busy night and the excuses and apologize from the waitress that we had only go so far.   We ended up finally getting the bill probably 30-45 minutes past when we had hoped to leave.  Disappointed, we will probably not return with so many other local microbreweries in the area that we have had far more pleasant experiences at.",

    "text": "I literally had the WORST restaurant experience in the past 10 years last night. If you like being called rude by the manager, having your appetizers show up 30 mins after you order them and your beer forgotten... you should go here. If you don't like that sort of thing, you should go somewhere else.   I also found it interesting that our first waitress' attitude changed as soon as she figured out we were a table of gays. Can't help but feel as though that had something to do with the crappy service we received from her.  Here are more details. Even after out waitress left our table mid drink order to get another table's drink when he asked her for it, we were never rude to her once nor called her out for that action. However, when I asked where my beer was 15 mins after ordering it (all others had been delivered) and when we told her we wanted to wait to order dinner until our last party member showed up, apparently that was rude. A new waitress showed up and said she didn't know why she was assigned to us. Right after her one of the managers showed up and asked if everything was okay and we told her that we were waiting for our appetizer and my beer. We asked where our other waitress went and the manager told us that she was taken off the table because she said we were being rude to her! What? Why would a manager tell you this even if it was True? Needless to say, we drank our beers, ate the appetizer and left. The experience as we were leaving with manager #2 is even more shocking but, since I didn't experience it first hand, I'll leave it to other members of our party to explain in a post of their own.  DO NOT GO HERE.  There are better quality establishments in the same area with better food and better service.",

However, there have been a few times now where the service has been sub par, just like the food. One time, the waitress disappeared for like 10 minutes not once checking on us. I had to flag her down to get our bill. Which, is not something I like to do as I find it extremely rude. It seems disappearing waitresses are a part of the service there. However, the last straw for me was last night. My son and I went so we could catch the Cardinals v Ravens game. The only seating available was outside, so we took it. However, they sat us close enough to the smoking section that some patrons took upon themselves to start smoking in our vicinity. Literally, the next table over. I made a complaint to the waitress. To her credit, she asked those smoking to move to the smoking section or put out the cigarette. But, that didn't stop other patrons from smoking in non designated spots and when I complained once more, a female patron (sitting at the table I complained about earlier) took it upon herself to insult my child's manners. (He is extremely well behaved, but may have been mistaken for not having any since we were rooting for the Ravens and he was also complaining about the cigarette smoke.) I think it's time to find another place close to home that will play the games. I had always suggested this place because they used to have good service and appreciated the fact that they were accommodating. Well...that's no more. I'm done. If you can't provide good service and can't keep the patrons in line...then nope. This is a restaurant, not a bar. I don't expect that people would talk smack to me when I'm with my child, at least not at a place like that. It was overpriced anyway. Good riddance Twin Peaks.",

Didn't really care much for how the waitresses would be constantly trying all these different angles to butter me up and play me to part with my hard earned cash like some insecure geek \"aw shucks\" loser/sucker. I think this place is mostly for the white collar type to safely experience a trailer trash fantasy they have. It totally gave the vibe and feel of a strip club. No thanks.",

They chairs and tables, I really found them uncomfortable, they were to high for my tastes. Well will I ever go back no, it was something I wanted to try, but to me it was just an overpriced copy of Hooter's, and nowhere as good.",

The last couple times the bartenders need to learn how to make drinks, and pour a beer! Mixed Drinks tasted like crap. Idk how you can mess up a jack and coke.lol. If you want a good drink, ask for mary the bartender. Shes the only one that can bartend. The one thing Ill will give them is all there staff is great looking!",

I asked the waitress if there was happy hour going on right now and she said \"yeah sure whatever\" , so me and my friends drank a few more beer extra . When we got our bill we noticed that the bill was full price , we asked the waitress if it was happy hour and she said \"Ohhh today is Saturday , I totally forgot ! \" she said it in a way like she didn't care and shrugged it off and giggled and walked away cards didn't even talked to the manager to say how to make it better . Like really I am server as well and i have been in that postion when you own up to your actions and say \"hey boss I messed up can you help me out please \" , it's been weeks since I came back !",

Now, I will confess I am a regular in this place when football season is in full swing, but I can say, without a doubt I come for the games, cold ass beer and great tv coverage. Yes, they do have some lightly clothed waitresses, but that is just a small part of what this place offers. I have never had a beer as cold as Twin Peaks. They serve these things (usually below 30 degrees temp) in a big f*ing glass with a nice slush floating on top. The beer alone is worth the trip! The one thing that knocks this place down a notch is the food. Had a couple things now, but I would only vouch for the queso. Always a great game and good prices at Twin Peaks. Oh yeah, chicks in little lumber gear too. Let's go Broncos!!",

Since this was my second time there and had a wonderful time on my first day I would give them a chance.  I order my meal and it was sent to another person because I watch it go back to kitchen and 5 minutes later, I finally got it.  The only time the staff talk to me if the meal is okay or do you want a drink.  No more on the talk; however, the staff would talk to the gentlemen on the right and left of me but not even make eye contact 'once' with me.  I was guest a customer and no more.   I finish watching the game and order one more drink and again the staff would not talk to me.   I paid my bill, and tried to talk to staff with ignore me so I found a manager.  I said to her, I am not coming back this is terrible and gave back a coupon from the first day because their service \"STINKS!\"",

Have eaten here many many times over the years and was a favorite spot to bring work clients in a for a good meal and never had any issues in the past. This time it took them atleast 15 min after seeting us before they even bothered to come by and introduce themselves or ask if we needed a drink. Several of the girls including our waitress was just hanging out chatting laughing it up completely ignoring us. Then they bring us drinks and the lady had an attitude when we simply asked for straws. Finally we place our orders and 2 put of the 4 plates were completely wrong and had to be reordered. So only half of us got to eat together while the other half sat and watched. When the correct food finally arrived they never offered to take it off bill or do anything to make up for only half our table being able to enjoy their meals together. On top of that the correct food was already cold and tasted terrible. I've always gotten the same thing and it definitely was not the same quality in times past. What has happened to this place? Service not good food not good. On top of that 3 other tables next to us also had to reorder food due to wring orders. Get it together!",

I was disappointed we ordered are 1st round of drinks and I asked our waitress Megan if the size of my drink was going to be 22oz size like the beers and she said yes.  When she brought the drinks over to us the drink I got was a lot smaller than expected.  I ordered the bacon appetizer and when Megan brought us the appetizer it was real cold like it was sitting out and another customer did not want it.  My buddy ordered the shrimp salad and I ordered the Silician sandwich.  When she brought our food to the table she brought a bacon cheese burger which I did not order.  When I brought it to her attention she was very apologetic and offered to give me a discount.  Finally when we received the receipt my discount was not on there.  I had to bring it up to her attention.  Megan needs more customer service and pay closer attention to detail.  In my opinion, she had to many tables to cover by herself.  Also the manager that had a very short haircut could help out a little more instead of just walking around and not doing anything.  The bartender was kind of slow too because our 2nd round of drinks took a long time to get them to our table.",

He wanted to go here and he kept saying It was \"Better than Hooters\" and \"see there are a lot of women here too.\" But really this is barely a step up from an in and out burger joint.   Yes, yes, yes, the waitresses are attractive, and they can hold a conversation, but when I go to eat that is not all I am going for.   Service was very pleasant, and timely. The was served by three different people. All were pleasant. Short polite conversation kept the 25 min wait time acceptable. But I don't know if everyone would be so accommodating.   One neat thing is that they list how cold there Draft is. 29.7 degress. I do like a cold beer and  I would like a visual of how cold there draft is.   Btw, I ordered my favorite drink, Greatful Dead, and while this is not a hard drink they figured it out and it was Fantastic!   So:  Food 3 star Service 5 star Drink 5 star  Thus may rating....",

We ordered beers and a shot. They took about 5-10 minutes to arrive. For that reason, I immediately ordered a steak salad subbing it with chicken with dressing on the side. That took a long time because the table next to us ordered after us and got the burger before us. We complained to our waitress and was told the chicken takes longer to cook than the pattie. Then in one minute she delivered my salad with no dressing. She came back and asked if I need anything else. I asked for dressing and got mustard base dressing instead of the cilantro vinaigrette. At that point, I was frustrated. We drank, ate and left.",

The food is always excellent too. My favorite is the pulled pork nachos. It is big enough for two people and one of the less expensive items on the menu. They frequently have \"themes\" where the staff dresses up in whatever the theme is, but that doesn't draw me in. What drew me in last visit was the advertisement of 2 oz of Samuel Adams Utopia plus the taster glass for $20. I called to verify it was at the location prior to going and once confirmed I immediately headed out. $10/oz for that is good, the food is excellent, and the staff friendly. How could I go wrong?",

Service was horrendous.  Ordered some spicy wings then waited more than 40 minutes for a drink refill (despite 2 separate servers asking if we were \"okay\" and asking both, politely, for a drink refill). Server was nowhere in sight. Where did she go? She had a group of tables and none of them were getting any attention. The table behind us was sitting there with their menus for around 15 minutes without even getting drinks. And our server was in the back somewhere.   When she finally brought us our drink refill, she was completely unapologetic.   I wouldn't even have written this review if she had just cared A LITTLE about our experience. She didn't. If I was management, I would be ashamed.",

The beer was the same, the food was the same but it wasn't the same, you know? Enter LeeAnn, a Texas girl who was really engaging and seems to rub off on her colleagues along the way. It's supposed to be fun, not formula. I don't love that the patio smoking spreads so easily to the indoors area, but it's not overwhelming. I've never had a bad drink at TP. The food is solid, no Michelin stars, but better than comparable fast casual places but with way more TVs and they'll switch to whatever game you want to watch, not just local stuff.

James the manager is very accommodating and if you can get the waitress Laken (rhymes with Bacon) you will have a great night. She took care of our whole party and gave everyone personal attention making them feel special. I highly recommend Laken for your next visit with a large party of fellas.",

    "text": "I met a friend here for lunch. She works across the street and informed me this was the 1st week this establishment was open.   The interior is very nice, new, sorta has that \"Flagstaff\" feel to it. We walked in during noon-ish so it was busy. I immediately notice that the staff are all women, hot women. Unfortunately they aren't the brightest. Example....the hostess checked her seating chart and asked us if we would like a booth, we both said yes and then another waitress arrived along side her and they both commenced to bickering about sitting another party at that booth.  We both let them continue for a few minutes because it was amusing seeing this then we finally chimed in and said the bar will be fine. lol  We sat at the bar and I started to look around. I noticed, and so did my female friend, there were hardly any women customers in this place. hahah I counted maybe 3 including my friend.  Okay so if you weren't aware and I wasn't either the servers all wear skimpy outfits, very similar to titled kilt's.  This location is located in the heart of the \"corporate business park area\". So literally 90% of the patrons were middle aged men, in business casual to corporate suites, probably 70% or more married and come here to look at the women, I always wonder why that does it for most men, I mean why not just go to a strip club at least there I know and expect what kinda service, vibe I'm going to get, plus the beers are cheaper and you get a better view if you know what I mean, but I digress.   So hardly any women customers, we both ordered a drink from the bartender, she came back with my IPA beer overflowing, probably the most horrible pour ever but I was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. Oh she asked me if I'd like \"the girl size beer, or the man sized beer\". I'm not sure if that's company policy or she was trying to be cute. I mean I wasn't offended but it felt like an awkward question to ask, I went with the girl one, I admit.   We both ordered food, I had the ranch grilled chicken sandwich, with fries. The bartender seemed very ditsy and clueless but she managed to get our orders correct.   The sandwich was okay, at first a little bland but once I got to the middle it was actually tasty.   We paid and left. I'm not sure I'll make an attempt to come back.   I have a feeling after a few weeks, months the hot waitresses will probably quit and they will have to hire better customer service, more competent women to fill those server spots. I sorta got the feeling that when hiring they just put out adds for hot girls in their early 20's and if they were hot enough, they were hired, no matter of their skills......that will only last for so long, it's a restaurant, not a strip club.",

    "text": "Decided to hit this place up for UFC night. It was a good choice and I would go there again. They had a $5 cover and a drink minimum but why not spend if you're at a sports bar. They theme here is very simple:  beer and breasts and yes there's lots of it to go around.  Pros:  1.  Good beer in good amounts. You don't get a simple little mug for your brew, you get a big, manly mug!   2.  This place must have been inspired by The Man Show. The theme is simple, a sports bar with some serious hotties helping you out. I would definitely say they have the best looking staff out of any \"breastaurant\" I've visited.  3.  I ordered a poblano chicken sandwich. I would say it was pretty good, lot's of bun (no pun intended, or maybe?), and seasoned fries. It was a good filler for my night of fight watching.  4.  The staff is definitely friendly but when you're a girl working for tips from a mostly male clientele it's part of the job. Still did their job very well.  Cons:  1.  Parking was very well advertised so I ended up parking in a far-away spot. Just learn the area first.  2.  Major sporting events might charge a cover but it was cheap. Get there early as well or you'll be stuck standing around. Luckily I'm intrepid enough to ask to share a table with people.  Overall it's a good place to be a man, do manly things, and feel like a man when leaving. Not sure what that actually means but it works for me.",

    "text": "After the first review of Twin Peaks, here is an update: The food has really improved with new items on the menu.  The management has changed and things are a lot better than they were before. Overall, I recommend Twin Peaks as long as they keep up the changes.  Original review: I came yesterday with my fiancee and we are regular customers. We would give a solid four stars if we didn't have the bad experience last night.  There are several servers we know after coming quite often and it is just a shame we cannot ask to be served by a server of our choice. We have had great experiences but last night... The service was simply horrible. The server didn't care about us at all, would barely make eye contact, and was more interested in chatting with a few guys only on other tables taking selfies. I had to ask 3 times if we could change the channel of the TV right next to us so I could watch the Women World cup soccer game between USA and Nigeria. I lost 15 minutes of the game before being able to watch it. I finally got it changed after asking one of the servers we know from our previous visits.  A lot of people were there as well for the Basketball game and one of the managers was more interested in seeing us leaving as soon as possible by turning around a couple times and saying out loud \"No, 13 is still here!\". We ordered food and beer but we totally felt pushed and ignored.  At the end, we complained to the manager who kept saying \"Oh... Really!\" multiple times as if we were lying. Then he said, \"I took care of the check for you\", no discount, nothing, barely apologizing. That was very rude. The food has been a great reason we came to Twin Peaks. This has not changed but other places serve great food as well! Better management is needed when it comes to serve customers who are not just a bunch of guys who will leave a big tip because they had a good chat with the server.  By the way, we usually give decent tips (10 dollars is the usual) but last night, our server didn't deserve a penny. Couples are customers as well! David, the previous manager would have never let that happen...  Not sure at all we will come back. But for sure, the experience last night was one star only!!",

    "text": "I went here last night and had a great time as usual. I can only give 4 stars for my experience last night because of their hostess. The young lady appeared to be unhappy/stressed out or even disinterested. I won't speculate why this happened, but I'd only want to encourage her to be the best actress she can be in her situation. That said, typically, my experiences here are 5 star. I moved here to Arizona in December and my apartment manager told me about Twin Peaks. I've been a regular ever since.   Last night was super slow at work, so while in the area I stopped in for a bite. I was elated to find out Sydnie was there. She was the first TP girl I had met and often request her on my repeat trips in. As usual, she was effervescent, kind and attentive. She was busy so she didn't get to sit with me, yet still made the effort to visit. She is an absolute doll. I really believe she is a genuine five star girl. Fantastic!  I ordered their chicken fried steak this time. Phenomenal dish. I was raised on low country/soul food and this was an amazing interpretation of that. The plating was top notch. I've been in the business for many years, so eye appeal is a large part of the experience. The flavor of the CFS alone was amazing, cooked perfectly, not greasy. It has a light seasoning on it, the steak was tender and easy to cut, and I especially loved the crunchy bits that make up the breading. Good stuff. The potatoes were amazing. I love the creamy garlic goodness. The gravy that complemented both the CFS and Potatoes was really tasty. Creamy, rich flavor of a True country gravy with the subtleness of jalapeno.  I've never had a creamy jalapeno gravy but this was great. Now what I affectionately call Rabbit Food. I am not a big proponent of vegetables; however, TP really knows how to serve them up. The green beans and onions were cooked up perfectly. To add flair and color the diced tomatoes and corn made them pop, but the real excitement added to these veggies was the addition of real pieces of bacon.   I really enjoy my time here and will continue to come in as my budget allows. I also want to compliment the manager on duty. Nearly every time I come in, Justin is there. What a great guy. Attentive to his guests, and respectful to the girls. He's awesome, and clearly the girls enjoy working with him. I can't wait to go back. I've had nearly everything on the menu. So, I cannot recommend one thing. At Twin Peaks Camelback, It's all good.",

Our server was Tiffany, ordered our food and we never got it. We also asked to split one of the bills and that wasn't also done. She seemed overwhelmed and busy so we weren't going to complain because we can see it was busy. Until she came back with the bill asking who had this debit card.. no one had that debit card and she got the other customer's table mixed up and one of our friends jokingly said \"might as well not charge anything\" and her feedback was \"Haha, don't push it\" with an annoyed pissed off tone. When confronted she said she was joking and never once apologized. Not cool at all, we didn't complain for our food not coming out at all and not splitting the bill. So don't give an attitude when you were wrong to begin with. Go there for the great drinks but if you get Tiffany, ask for a different server! Second yelp complaint and review given!",

    "text": "I've read several disappointing reviews of this place on Yelp, however, I was lured here by friends to participate in an NFL Fantasy Draft and it wasn't at all as bad as I had been led to believe. Caveat: It was a Monday. The beer was a tad on the icy side and had been over poured so that it was running down the side of the mug and had to be cleaned off the table as it was melting. Other than that, there were plenty of servers who attended our every need and were very pleasant overall. The staff was great in my opinion. They were very welcoming to groups conducting fantasy drafts as there were at least 2 other tables of guys doing the same thing as we were. Overall, not to shabby.",

    "text": "Typical corporate hooters wannabe knockoff. While the food is marginally better than Hooters the problem here is the beer. They seem to be stuck in the 70's with their idea that to be good beer must be served below freezing temperature. They are actually proud that they serve their beer at 28 degrees.  Wake up management and yes serve your Bud and Coors at those temperatures but welcome to the modern era, craft beer should be served in the low 40's to be able to taste the flavor and get the right aroma out of the beer. Average service from scantilly clad girls who are looking for MRS degrees from hipster wannabes.",

    "text": "I came in about 2 weeks ago, just after it opened. Wow. Atmosphere of a ski lodge; Hooters-style barmaids swarming everywhere in obvious, ridiculously, almost tauntingly-provocative outfits; no choice on size of beers (although they brew their own, and I gotta hand it to them for the effort to do so in a town dominated by Four Peaks) - they serve 'em tall! Okay...I did talk to one really cool girl who is a drummer with a great, friendly personality. We talked music. There was a communication there - aside from \"salacious eyes and pouty attitude serving it up to supposedly drooling middle aged men\", so I'll give the Twins 3 stars. Maybe I'll be back to talk more music with their best asset.",

Everyone needs to come on down to twin peaks and make sure that either one of these waitresses  ( Erica and carley ) helps them out. Erica was so bubbly and energetic with a gorgeous smile made my experience a memorable one. And carley was personable she would come up and have conversations with us even though we were not table. This establishment will definitely be my go to place for Monday night football",

Had been shopping all day was in the area and wanted to catch the last half of a football game and have an ice cold micro brew. The brew was awesome and cold. My server Tina was on the ball , she really took care of us even tho this is suppose to be a man cave(as usual i was on an adventure with mom, which is always fun). We decided to split the fish tacos(always my favorite)because we heard they were so good (dissappointed) were not that good. We mentioned it to Tina and she had David the manager come over right away and he took care of the problem. we switched to the chicken tacos and they were awesome. We will deffinetly go back. Loved the service. Thank you Tina for your service. Thank you David for taking care of the problem. BTW We do not find the servers outfit offensive or riskay at all. They were very cute.",
