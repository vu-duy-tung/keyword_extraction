It was pretty spicy and had a few olives and a cucumber and lime which was nice. I ordered a BLT and fries. The fries were excellent. They were steak fries and really hot and crispy. The sandwich was not the best thing I've ever had. The marble rye was nicely toasted but the bacon was just a little too hard. I would come back and try a different sandwich or a dessert.  The bartender mentioned the desserts are made by a famous phoenix baker.  Overall reasonably priced and have a friendly staff.",

The bartender also waited our table - he was an older gentleman who was very friendly and entertaining. The service was fast, and the food was pretty good. The appetizer was $2 off (food special) so it was worth it. If you're in the mood for a small bar with reasonably priced and reasonably tasting food, this place is worth visiting. I would have given this place 4 stars if they had better drinks/drink specials.   Appetizer: Green Mary Lou: reminded me of a crispier, thicker quesadilla. A little heavy and greasy but really good! Would have gone really well with a dark beer.  Entrees: 1) Karsen's Burger: simply dressed burger, but the meat was pretty good 2) Portobello veggie sandwich which was stacked!",

The steak fries were definitely done right - not one of them was limp and not crispy.  The spicy chicken sandwich was very good.  I liked this a lot better than the burger.  The coleslaw I got as a side for it though was bland and watery.    All in all, its got a hefty price tag but ingredients are good and food is cooked right.  Nothing a little salt won't fix.

The French Dip here is probably the most amazing sandwich I've  had in years. Each bite gave me a mini \"O\" and I crave more. I saddened as each bite vanished in my mouth but then immediate rejoiced as the beef juices reached my taste buds. When I finished my mouthed longed for another but my stomach was screaming for me to stop. I am not joking. I would light punch a sleeping baby in the stomach if it meant I could have one of these French dips.

The drinks were good a always (no short pours here that i've had) and the food great. i didn't have but the burgers were big and juicy looking and the salad with cajun chicken was great. BEST honey mustard dressing i ever had.  Anyhow, glad i went and will be back sooner. It's small, with 6 tables and the 10 seat bar but... close friends and fun can be found here.  ENJOY IT.... and worth the trip for this small almost out of the way place.

Full bar, menu of usual bar/grill fare, but we dug it.  A club sammy and the special today, the pulled pork sammy.  Both solid, not too anything including grease or sauce so that was nice.  Great steak cut fries and potato salad to match.  Bottomless soda and iced tea.  Great place regularly checking back if we wanted anything, if it was to our liking and offering to top off our drinks.  We understand the desert is bomb, but didn't have any room for it.

This place most definitely is your dream dive bar- friendly service (our waiter/bartender was amazing), great food, and great vibe. The place is small, and best suited for small groups (Maybe 10 tables in the whole place) but totally worth it!   We split the fried mac & cheese bites, I had the Karsen's Kuban and my boyfriend had the Southwest Cardiac- He swears the burger was the best burger he had ever had, and my Kuban was amazing.

    "text": "Lunch at Karsen's today was great. I had a hard time deciding between the Kuban, the patty melt or Finley's Philly. Settled on the Philly and it was the BOMB!!  It was the best I've had - tender meat, onions sliced just right, perfect blend of flavorings. Wanting to try the patty melt, I was happy when my coworker asked to trade halves. It was also very good with excellent seasonings and the onions sauteed perfectly . Our other coworker ordered the Kuban and all I can say is \"next time\". Everything was soo good including the service!",

Full of flavor and delicious. The fries were well seasoned and really filling. I also got a chance to try my friend's salt and pepper wings which were amazing. I loved the portion sizes.

Oh well this small Old Town Scottsdale bar is a nice watering hole but the food is tasty but not stellar based on photos. Most of the items posted on Yelp weren't even available to purchase so be warned before coming in.  Ok , so I did sample a few items. Chili was interesting and tasty yet it was more soupy than a chili. FYI order a cup it's a large serving. Buffalo wings very good with a nice kick to them so you won't be disappointed. However the Mac n Cheese deep fried sticks were a bust. Didn't taste very good with green glow to them. Something I'd skip if you want Franks thoughts on the matter.  Bar is few blocks from the San Fransisco Giants spring training stadium so you can cocktail it up before or after the game. I'm sure you'll find the place a cool hangout but my thoughts are the cuisine wasn't stellar.   *** Note the help was exceptional and the lady running the bar was outstanding , helpful and very attentive to our needs.

If you have never heard of one (don't worry, we didn't either) the Green Mary Lou is an extra large flour tortilla stuffed with Queso Dip, topped with Karsen's fabulous homemade Machaca Beef, green chili sauce and Cheddar & Jack Cheese. Wow. But we warn you, it's definitely a meal so come hungry! During the summer, the Green Mary Lou is one of the Cool Summer Specials and at $5, it leaves money still in your wallet for that adult beverage!

Too much BBQ sauce. Why do they call it a Cuban sandwich? It's more like a BBQ sandwich with a slice of ham. The pickles in it were good and I liked the bread.",

I ordered the sweet potato fries, which are difficult to make crispy. I've had crispy, so it can be done. These fries were probably the droopiest sweet potato fries I've had. Next time I'll get the regular fries. Our wait-person was very attentive, but not overbearing. We will be back!!",

We passed this restaurant and it smelled really good, but I'm ashamed to admit we bypassed it because it didn't look as cutesy as the other restaurants we were looking at.  Plus it wasn't on the first page of yelp ;).  Finally after striking out for the 3rd time, I stopped and yelped the restaurant name and it came up with great reviews.  I was not disappointed at all.  I got their chipotle burger special while my family respectively ordered their cuban sandwich, french dip and another burger plate.  The food was great and the service was phenomenal!  Our drinks never made it past the halfway mark and he made sure we had everything we wanted right away.  Next time I'll be trying that cuban sandwich, I snuck a bite off my mom's and it was very tasty and I loved the (french?) bread.  My new years resolution is to try a restaurant without the compulsive need to yelp it and to trust my nose over the exterior of a place.",

I ordered the Southwest Cardiac and my girlfriend ordered the Cuban sandwich. The burger was INCREDIBLE. The meat was flavorful and all the topping complimented the burger. I got a side of onion rings, which the bartender suggest I order their ranch on the side. Boy did he know what he was talking about. The ranch & onion ring combo was AMAZING. I tried some of the Cuban and it too was delicious. My gf got their steak fries on the side and they too were AMAZING!!!! The portions were HUGE and so were the flavors! Would definitely recommend to anyone!!! Will definitely be back SOON!!!",

Everything was fresh and you could taste it was hand crafted plates. If we could make one recommendation it would be add some craft beer choices .... this would be the most effect place for it!",

It was okay, but we were expecting something in the burrito style, and it came out more like a quesadilla.  Also, the flavor of the machaca beef was okay, but I've definitely had way better.

All who ordered mixed drinks seemed to be enjoying them. Nice selection of wings (a variety of styles), apps, a daily soup, sandwiches, etc. I opted for an Italian beef sandwich.  It was in a roll which held up well to the \"gravy.\"  Ample amount of very tasty, thinly shredded beef on it.  I selected the sweet potato fries as my side.  They cut all their own potatoes fresh there and you could tell.  The fries were delicious, with just a hint of salt and cinnamon sugar.  I don't eat fries often, and these were definitely worth it.  It was friendly and inviting, and seems like a great place for locals as well as a drop-by tourist.",

I almost hate writing this review because I selfishly don't want anyone to know about this amazing Bar . The food is to die for and I have posted photos on Yelp as well. I don't care about portion size, what I care about is quality food and Karsen's nails it. Honestly, it's a very small Bar, but the Owner \"Rocky\" and Scott make you feel like you are part of a family, where \"Everybody knows your name\". I could go on and on about this place. if you live in the area or visiting from out of State, stop in and enjoy amazing food and outstanding service. Karsen's has become are goto place to dine in Scottsdale, so check it out and enjoy the best kept secret in Old Town!",

We got the queso dip as an appetizer and it was unbelievable,  we could tell it was fresh and it was super creamy.  The burgers where juicy and flavorful without all the extra sauces and toppings, and the sweet potato fries were great.  They were sweet but savory at the same time and really satisfying.

I don't know how I grew up and live just minutes away without hearing about Karsen's OR have not come across it on Yelp yet! {Their reviews speak for themselves.} I was in the area, starving, and wanting to try something new so I whipped out my handy dandy Yelp app and came across this hidden gem!   It is a tiny, dark, fab little spot. I ordered their club and it was literally the best club that i've ever had in my life. From the buttery melt-in-your-mouth sourdough, to the crispy bacon, ham, turkey, avocado, candied jalapenos, jalapeno cream cheese, and more it was just a heavenly sandwich that I haven't stopped raving about {or craving} since I left. ALSO - THEIR HAND CUT FRIES. You guys, these are some of the best fries that i've ever had in my life! They're thick cut and seasoned to perfection. Pro Tip: They also have dreamy ranch, if you're a ranch fanatic like me! My husband had their Friday special which was the Panko crusted + parmesan fish and chips. He also said they were phenomenal.   We will absolutely be back! My dad LOVES dive bars so I can't wait to bring him here!! It is also worth mentioning that the service was quick and friendly!",

I haven't tried the Sunday FREE breakfast buffet yet simply because I've either enjoyed Saturday too much & I'm still sleeping or someone has scraped me off of my bed too early for church. But one of these days I'm going to make it. Mark my words I'm going to make it. So if you can & are in the old town Scottsdale area stop by say hello to everyone & pull up a stool & watch some sports or just catch up with someone. If your agenda is chill, nosh & have a drink this is your place. Try the grape crush tall on the rocks. It's refreshing & goes down like grape koolaid. Now go & chill you'll thank me later.",

Plus the prices were great! Highly recommended.",

I have been back on more than one occasion since the start of spring training & have tried something from every category on the menu.. & have LOVED every single thing. Everything comes out hot, fresh & looks as good as it tastes! And they don't hold back- you get very generous portions of everything! Can't beat their daily specials either!

But, every now and then you end up there.  This place is a great retreat from the Affliction body spray and fist pumping that is everywhere else in this neck.  I walked in and I met 3 other people who listened to Widespread Panic.  One of them was a female.  Very impressive!  The radio was a nice mix of Grateful Dead, Widespread, Black Crowes, and other jam bands.  Think I've found my new favorite bar.  I don't remember prices really as some guy there kept buying everyone shots.  I stumbled out happy.  Will be back.",

Got out to wandering around and found ourselves here, after initially passing it once, we returned.   Such a small down to earth, charming spot with a few tables and about 8 stools at the bar. It had a crowd of mostly regulars, but being that is was such a small place it wasn't crowded while we were there. They had a small flat screen in the corner playing the Suns game and several people popped in to pick up phone orders and take food to-go.  Seeing that we decided to supplement our liquid dinner with a shared chicken strip plate. Over all it was good, the chicken tenders and the fries were cooked to order and they served with our choice of both BBQ sauce and ranch. Hit the spot.   Service was prompt and very friendly (sorry but I can't recall the man's name who was tending bar...my attention was elsewhere). But I would be sure to go back when he was working.",

While we were there though I felt hurried and overlooked.  I kept it simple with a margarita since we didn't have a drink menu and weren't offered one and my husband ordered a can beer. Cool.  We are not sure what to order so the server suggest a Cuban sandwich, double cool. However, the pork was braised and it totally alters the whole taste of a Cuban, I don't want to nit-pick but our server assured us this was a classic on the menu. Meh, not really. It has no continuity, the ciabatta overpowered the braised pork and the pickled cabbage competed with the pickle.  Meanwhile, after ordering another margarita and cashing out our tab our server never informed me she was using top shelf tequila which she added an extra $4 to the $17 Margaritas, on top of the $7 CAN OF BEER.  In my opinion that's a lack of communication and consideration.",

    "text": "This is a small bar and grill located in Old Town. I decided to order take out and seeing the 4.5 stars it made my decision up. The pictures of the food look great so let's do it!  I went to the website but the menu page wasn't working so I had to search it down on fb. Most of the picture of food weren't on the menu.  I wouldn't have thought every pictures would be just the special of that particular day, but what do I know.  I ordered the Coney and side salad with no onions. My husband ordered the Chipotle Bbq burger. They get less stars because: 1. The menu had to be hunted down.  2. I ordered my food without onions and instead, I got a smothering of them. Not only do I despise their crunch, but anything they touch, tastes like onions.  3. My Coney had GOBS of mustard. It was disgusting and tried to scoop some of it off.   The burger was rated ok. Nothing bad, but nothing noteworthy.   Alas, our search for pick up burgers continue...",

Heidi was our bartender and did more than an amazing job.....I recommend the grape crush shot, truly delicious. I had the special which was a burger with a green chili cheese sauce that was probably the best thing I've put in my mouth in the past week.

The lady serving made you feel welcome immediately.  There was a mixture of tourists and locals having a lunch.  One man ordered the balogna sandwich, which I have not seen offered in a menu.  He was very pleased with it.  My husband & I had bbq pork and brisket sandwiches.  Excellant choies.  Both of us were very happy.  His side of potato salad was good as was my salad with a mixture of honey mustard/ranch dressing.  Glasses of soda and water were kept filled.  We were very happy we went here instead of the larger restaurants around.  Looking forward to coming back in the future.",

We had the homemade quest dips with fresh chips, French dip was outstanding (au jus, green chile, map,e bacon, prime rib and Boursin), did I already say it was to die for.

Well maybe it was 9 or so, but that's late for me.  I went with the turkey philly spike style (jalapeno and green chiles) and potato salad.  The potato salad (house-made) was pretty good, and I'm extremely hard to please with that.  The philly was better than I expected considering it was smoked turkey and not ribeye, and the jalapeno and chiles definitely made it better!  I can't remember the name of the guy working that evening, but he was awesome.  Even though he was tasked with both tending bar and waiting tables, actually one table, he was on top of things and made us feel like regulars.  In fact, I'm wondering now why I haven't been back.  Will have to rectify that soon!",

The 2 ladies working at the time, were very friendly, helpful and gladly answered any questions we had regarding the menu. At the table next to us, there was a lady and her daughter eating, and she was telling us about the food, and how good things are. One of ladies that was working mentioned \"We have the best Burgers in Old Town Scottsdale....\". I was wanting a light lunch, but Im also our family's resident \"Burger Expert\". CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! I ordered the Karsen's Burger, and my Wife ordered the Mary Lou. I couldn't stop looking at the food at the table next to us. It looked fantastic! A couple times I actually wondered if its really bad form to grab something off someone else's table and eat it. Food shows up, and we dig in. Wife is in a steady state of impersonating miss packman, so I had a good idea she was liking her plate. I took a bite of the Burger, and immediately had that \"cocked head\" look a dog has when its thinking. This burger was THE BEST I have had! Not greasy. Not seasoned to death. The bun toasted to perfection! As I devoured the burger, I turned to the fires. Fries are a funny thing, as every one has different taste. These were fried potatoes. Period. And crunchy. In other words.....PERFECT! Ive been eating burgers for 40 years. This place has been around for 20+ years. HOW have I not eaten here before? Doesn't matter! I found it now, and Im coming back!   Well done Karsen's! Thank you for an absolutely delicious lunch!",

    "text": "Most reviewers like Karsen's food -- and so did I.  The patty melt was fresh and tasty, the rueben was just as a rueben should be, and my bottled beer ... well it was bottled beer.  The service was pleasant and reasonably prompt.  So why just three stars?  It's not just that the French fries were soggy.  Clue #1 - Our server was the bartender.  Clue #2 - We were not sitting at the bar.  It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that Karsen's must be a very small place.  Indeed it is, with six small tables inside, and about eight seats at the bar.  So what's wrong with that? --- Nothing.  Throughout Spain and Italy bars like this are the main places people go for quick meals.  But Karsen's takes small to a new level.  For example, there are no draft beers.  For example, from your table you get a view of a long untidy corrider leading to the back of the building.  For example, your one seating option is a bar stool.  In the end, Karsen's feels a bit like a third world beer joint, slightly upgraded, and with food much better than one would expect at such a place.  Three stars -- that's just about right.",

    "text": "We just recently moved to Old Town Scottsdale and for the last 6 months have been making the rounds of all the bars and restaurants in the area.  We walked by this place last night and it perfectly fits our MO - small, personal and they sell cold beer.  Sat down and got the a very cold Bud Light which is a great start.  Its surprising how many bars don't know the importance here and these guys did.  The price is a little above average which is surprising given the basic nature of this place.  We struck up a conversation with the bartender and for half a beer I thought we had found a place that would be on the permanent rotation.  Unfortunately it went south in a hurry.  The bartender who is also one of the owners turned out to be at best a pompous ass.  It was so bad my wife got up and walked out and left a third of her beer - yes we went from 100 to minus 10 in less than a quarter of a beer - about 3 minutes. Comically the bartender was looking at me like \"what did I do?\".  I have owned and operated many customer facing businesses including bars, restaurants and resorts and my current company caters specifically to the best hospitality businesses around the US.  I personally serve as a consumer advisor to two major hotel chains and one airline.  When a customer tells you something they are proud of, you don't degrade and demean it.  You accomplish nothing by trying to make yourself look good at their expense.  This situation actually started pretty benign as we asked the guy about his history with the bar and how long he had been in Arizona.  I commented my wife was a native and she added she was a 4th generation native.  Somehow this guy took that personal and went on a rant about why that didn't mean shit.  \"I went to such and such elementary school, this middle school, this high school and SCC so what is so great about being a native.\"  That is just one quote.  The diatribe didn't stop.  Quite honestly I was dumbfounded it was so inappropriate.  When this Gen Xer gains a little more maturity what hopefully goes through his head the next time someone tells him they are a 4th generation Arizonan is 1.  This person probably has a VERY big group of friends and family and 2. I should probably at a minimum not degrade them so they give us a good recommendation.  Clearly that filter between your brain and your mouth has not totally developed here.  The good news / bad news is I have 8 bars around the country where they hand me what I drink before I order.  My wife and I are two of the best customers those 8 places have and we are out almost every night.  I personally have been in Arizona since 1971 and have a huge group of friends and business associates garnered over all those years.  My wife's family goes back to 1917 and also has a huge group of friends.  Given there were only 2 other people in the place while we were there, I don't know how well they are doing but they aren't maxed out by any means so I am guessing they would appreciate additional businesses.  They won't get any referrals from us and worse we will likely tell this negative story as we make the rounds and discourage anyone we know from going there.  We will not ever go back.  If we are looking for a dive bar, we will make our way to Patty's two streets over where the bartenders are personable and mature and the beers are 33% cheaper.  If we want a little more upscale experience we will go to Old Town Tavern where the owner is awesome and is more concerned with his customers than himself.",

If I hadn't met dayside bartender Heidi at another location I would never have known of this place and I've probably walked by it numerous times in the past.  Located on 1st Street in Old Town Scottsdale, Karsen's is a great place for comfort food like burgers, salads, soups, and patty melts. Karsen's also sports a full bar.  In addition to the food, the other item that's clearly kept Karsen's going all these years is the atmosphere. The staff and the owners clearly know and value their regulars and you can tell that the regulars reciprocate. Even going in as a new customer I was made to feel very welcome and that's the type of service that builds loyalty.  If you want a no-pressure, low key place to get food or drinks in Old Town Scottsdale, check out Karsen's Grill, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "A literal \"hole in the wall\" Karsen's packs a punch bigger than its size. On a quick tour stop in Scottsdale, using Yelp as a guide, my wife and I stumbled into Karsen's .  Per many recommendations we tried the green Mary Lou and it stood up to its reviews. Tender beef served on a flour tortilla flatbread style. Delicious blend of spices added just the right amount of heat. Also had the pork tacos, served as nice chunks of pork rather than carnitas style.  A little kick of spice brought home the southwestern flair.  Side salad was standard but veggies were fresh. Heidi at the bar was sweet an attentive ... Add draft beer and this is a 5 star joint!",

A little dark, but friendliest staff anywhere and burgers and wings were worth going in. The burgers are huge and everyone was eating one. Seems everyone knew everyone so we just watched the magic and ate our food and drank $3 beer.  Its in the Western area of Old Town, I mean you can jump out the door and get on a horse and carriage ride, which is more fun half tanked and I know this.",

Thinly sliced and lightly breaded with a little heat. So good! I had the santa fe salad. It had fresh roasted corn, beans, tomatoes, avocados, chicken and candied jalapenos and served with an avocado ranch type dressing. So good! On fridays, they have fish in many ways. Sandwich, tacos or fish n chips. My friend git the fish sandwich with chipotle coleslaw and a choice of side. Choices are fries, salad, sweet potato fries or a shot of Jager! Yes! So awesome. The owner came out of the kitchen and said hi to us, thanked us for coming in and was chatting up the regulars. Server/bartender was so fast and friendly....we just loved it.",

    "text": "Scott operates a fine place with really good, creative food and the friendliest service in Scottsdale. It sits directly across the street from Scottsdale's superb Farmers' Market on Saturdays on the north side of 1st Street (not to be confused with 1st  Avenue two blocks to the north). Tourists may not easily spot Karsen's on the south edge of Old Town, but it's well worth walking around a couple of corners to find.   My wife and I were there for the first time yesterday, and since we recently relocated nearby we plan to return often for their casual and tasty creations. Several of the customers seemed like regulars, and the whole atmosphere was jovial and welcoming.   One patron who was having lunch at the bar was joined a while later by a friend bringing him a grocery bag full of grapefruits harvested from her backyard. When we commented on the exchange, she offered to run home and bring us some as well. That's friendliness to strangers!   I had a really good pulled pork sandwich and a side of fresh potato salad. My wife had a veggie sandwich on extra fresh rye bread with perfectly ripe avocado, among other good, super-fresh  things. A couple at an adjoining table had the green chili stew and they told us that the gumbo and other homemade soups are their favorite things at Karsen's Grill. We hope those dishes are available on our next stop there.   Hats off to Scott for running a gem of a place in Old Town Scottsdale.",
