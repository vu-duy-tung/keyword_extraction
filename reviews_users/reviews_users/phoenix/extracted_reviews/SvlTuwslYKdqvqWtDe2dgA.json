We get there, my husband runs in and we end up waiting another 45 MINUTES for our to-go order! With a 3.5  year old and 5 month old waiting in the car. Wtf?! If it's going to take an hour for two burgers and a kids meal, please tell us when we call! Totally unacceptable and ruined my night!",

Well cooked (a little pink in the center), well seasoned (not over-seasoned), great condiments (Aioli garlic mayo) serious bacon and cheddar. Brioche bun fresh baked and tasty. All in all, best burger I've had in a long, long time. Got their basic burger for first time. Will be back to try some others.",

    "text": "I ordered the falafel burger, and was stoked that there was something vegetarian on the menu!!! It was good but waaaaaay too much curry...the curry powder overpowered every other element on my plate. Could do without or with much less. My boyfriend had a classic cheeseburger and really, really enjoyed it. We shared the aioli flight and were so excited...but slightly disappointed when it came out. The fries were unbelievably delicious! But all of the aiolis looked the exact same... a dull tan color...honestly not that appetizing. Furthermore, there was zero indication of which sauce was which flavor and I couldn't even tell by taste. Would skip the flight next time.   The young, blonde woman who took our order (and was basically running the place by herself) was delightful! Very, very happy with her service. She was kind and attentive to every guest in the building.",

The service was outstanding. I was constantly asked if I needed anything and they even brought over different sauces to dip our fries in. After our meal I ordered a Oops! All berries shake which was so so good! I really loved my meal here and will definitely be back again. This is such a nice small cozy restaurant and it feels like they really put work into the food they serve and have pride. Don't hesitate and go right in and you will be surprised with your meal.

    "text": "So my wife and I wanted to get a good cheeseburger and some fries, we normally go to Paradise Burger Co, Red Robin, In and Out, Five Guys, or Gordon Bersch, but decided we wanted to try something different.  So I jumped on Yelp and searched for some burger joints in our area.  That led me to Aioli Gourmet Burgers.  They are located off Shea and the 101.  The place seemed pretty clean, and kinda had a diner feel to it.  You walk up to the counter place an order and the food gets delivered to your table.  So we ordered the Pretzel Bites, loaded fries, white truffle Swiss burger, and the aioli burger and shared a strawberry milk shake.  The food was pretty good, the burger had a lot of flavor and the fries were excellent, my only knock on the burger was the size of the meat to bun ratio.  I found myself removing some of the bun, cause it was a little too much for the amount of burger meat.  I think the burger was 1/3 of a lb or a little less.  My wife enjoyed the pretzel bites, they were served piping hot with some sort of mustard and a cheese sauce, very tasty.  The milk shake was probably our least favorite.  It had a lot of whipped cream on top and was extremely thick.  Drinking it out of a straw was damn near impossible, and needed a spoon to eat it.  We let it melt down a little before we were able to drink it.  Overall, pretty solid place, I'm glad I ventured out and gave this place a try.  They have a variety of burgers and the food was pretty good.  The prices are reasonable, if you go to Zinburger or Delux, you'll drop 12 to 15 bucks on just the burger, so paying 8 or 9 bucks for a burger is pretty good.  I would recommend this place for a good burger.",

We only live a mile away so it made sense to eat at home :-) We got our burgers fresh off the grill and they were plenty hot when I got home.   Don't let the construction turn you off, they're open for business! And if you're feeling guilty* after your meal, stop in at YouFit gym next door!  Good job! I hope people check it out so that we can count on a close, GOOD, burger joint for years to come!  *they do lettuce wrap and gluten free options ;-)",

Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.  Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'  As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.  Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.  My advice to management: Tell staff to read, slow down, listen and understand how important customer service is.  Advice to Yelpers: Smash Burger or In N Out. Taste hasn't changed, service much better. If in Vegas, Wahlburgers.",

I personally don't like burgers but after trying this one it changed my perspective. The chicken is still my fave since I just like chicken more in general, but the regular Aioli Burger is the best in my opinion. We also heard on on the radio that it's one of the best burgers in valley which got us to come in and of course get hooked. The staff has been SO friendly and nice - can't wait to come back again and again!",

The burgers are tasty and well cooked, with some great combo options. I had the original aioli burger with a pink center, I was not disappointed. I also had the salted Carmel shake which was not too thick but made me work at drawing it up the straw. The restaurant is large, clean and simple. They have a burger challenge for those that are into that sort of thing.   Recently the owner/chef was on Food Networks chopped and won! Kind of a cool honor and gives some validation to the chefs burger creations.   I would definitely recommend going and having a burger there.",

I think the prices were reasonable especially compared to hop doddys. The burgers were amazing! Great flavor and juicy, you'll need lots of napkins. But not greasy, which was awesome. I love they have different varieties of aioli which makes dipping fries fun. The only thing is that the burger options is a short menu... get creative! Add more, because you guys are doing a great job and aren't going anywhere! It's great to see a place thrive in that location, I've seen so many businesses in that place and you guys are going to kill it. Much love",

    "text": "So here's my story. I've lived in the area for many years and for many years, our area has been greatly under served so I was happy to see a local burger joint pop up and give some variance to our few local offerings. I want to support small business especially in our community, perhaps that's why I gave an extra star for this visit.  We went on a weekday, close to their rather early close time of 8:00 pm, we got there at 7:30. There were 3 other tables and we had friends who met us shortly after. My wife and I ordered a couple burgers, sweet potato fries and drinks, about $25 said and done. Not cheap but not expensive. We were asked of the burgers, pink or no pink. Then we sat and waited for our food to arrive.   I did notice some dirty tables but being the end of the night and after \"dinner rush\", it wasn't a huge deal, however Im a restaurant industry guy and in my world that would have been unacceptable but didn't affect my experience as much as made them look less than clean. Our friends arrived shortly after and ordered the same as we had.  The time is now around 7:40 and the front counter lady begins stacking and moving chairs across the floor, basically closing shop around us. As mentioned, I'm a restaurant guy, was for years in operations. There's few things that bothered me more than the feeling of rushing guests out. By no means did anyone there ask us to wrap it up but stacking furniture around your still dining tables doesn't send a polite message. I realize the desire to get home and keep labor costs down but shouldn't be at the expense of your guests experience.  When I saw them doing this, after shuddering, I said to our friends, just watch, people are still going to come in and they'll turn them away. And guess what happened, 2 more couples came in and both groups were told, sorry, our kitchen is closed. Now, this is a neighborhood restaurant, meaning, virtually every person coming in is a potential long term customer. Also, the people in this neighborhood are most likely the only customers you (Aioli's) will have, our little community are your guests, for the most part, your only guests. So a couple things here, closing at 8:00 is a bit early, if it must be 8:00, then close at 8:00 and not 15 minutes early. Don't rush out your guests while they eat or send a message as such by making noise and stacking, cleaning around them and for the love of God, don't turn people away who are attempting to give you their business! None of them will come back and give you another chance. You absolutely blew your chance of making those people your customers and they'll tell everyone about what happened. In my day, management would be fired for doing what I saw done, and happily. That's not guest service, that's being self serving.   Final operational failures were we, all 4 of us were all asked of our burgers, pink or no pink. We all ordered pink, NONE received pink. My wife and I both ordered sweet potato fries. When the guy brought out our food, he had both my and my wife's basket, I could see his eyes glancing back and forth between our baskets, he stopped walking for a second as though pondering something then continued and dropped off our food and walked away without a word.. I saw what I think he was looking at, my wife's sweet potato fries were a pretty golden orange color, mine were more black than orange, burned. I didn't send them back but come on. He definitely saw them and sent them out anyway, No one checked on our table until we were near ready to pay. It wasn't a big deal enough for me to stop their closing procedures to remake my fries but it was an obvious reflection of their priorities.   To sum it up, we split 2 burgers, one was good, the other was so-so at best. My wife's fries were good, mine terrible. The service was, seemingly, over being there that night, that was the impression I can guarantee a dozen different patrons received. I know opening a restaurant is tough especially with certain days and hours being slower than others. However, this is the business and location you chose. If you plan on gaining our communities support, then I suggest each day you and your stafff are reminded of what you are there to do and who to do it for. One of the mantras of the very successful restaurant group I worked for, for over a decade was, \"we are only as good as our last meal\". It's a good way of keeping your priorities in check and assuring you don't drop the ball. May I suggest you adopt the same mantra, you are only as good as your last meal! It wasn't good. Best of luck Aiolis.",

    "text": "This is our second time to Aioli Burger, and as they are newly opened, I understand that there will be some growing pains. Our first time was so good, so we tried again, once again on a busy weekend night. First the good - the Italiano burger is so consistently good, and we love the loaded fries. The truffle burger was solid, and the chocolate shake was delicious. The meh - while the wait wasn't bad, it appeared that there were numerous other customers waiting for to-go orders that had been waiting a while and were obviously not pleased. Doesn't strike a lot of confidence as we're placing a to-go order, though I didn't find the wait too long. What was disconcerting is that we didn't get a receipt, so we had no idea how long we waited. We didn't get a number either, so we really had to sit and hope they did in fact have our orders. I somehow feel more assured with a receipt in hand, but I even asked and they said that I would get a receipt at the end. We didn't, so even now I have no idea how long we waited or how much our bill was. Irritating, but not a deal-breaker - they obviously need to figure out a better system for to-go orders. And finally the terrible - I can overlook a lot of managerial issues, but I want all of my food to be at least passable (and to be fair, most of our food was exceptional). I had raved last time about the kids meals - I was impressed by both the chicken fingers and kids burger. I ordered chicken fingers for my kids again, and unfortunately, they were inedible, even to my kids who routinely enjoy stale cheerios and things that fall on the floor. They looked nothing like the chicken fingers from last time; these were dry and overcooked and overall not good. We threw them all away, which is sacrilege in my household. Will I go back? Definitely. Am I a bit disappointed? Yep. Hopefully this was an anomaly as this is right in our favorite area.",

Ordered a gluten free bun with my California burger and sweet potato fries. Order came pretty quick, fries looked delicious, so started eating them. Yikes, they were battered in flour! The lady taking our order did swap them out for regular fries quickly though when I told her. Just wished she had said something when I ordered, or that it was marked on the menu. Our burgers were OK, had good toppings, but were quite greasy. So much so that my burger buns was halfway soaked before I even started eating. Glad the neighborhood has a new eatery, but hope they can fine tune it a bit. I want them to make it!",

    "text": "This place was a big disappointment for me. The food was mediocre and looked nothing like the Instagram pictures. For example I ordered the Chocolate Lovers shake, which on Instagram has all these chocolate toppings like whoppers, chocolate chips, and brownies. They give you just a regular chocolate watered down shake. I asked them about it and they didn't care to make it right but tried to add stuff to it (chocolate chips). Because the shake was so watered down you can imagine where the chocolate chips ended. This wasn't the first problem either. The person who took our ordered asked how I wanted my burger no pink or just a lil pink. I said a lil pink, I got mostly pink. It was gross. I thought to myself when our food came out, that it was really quick for being a burger. The amount of pink proved why it came out so quick.The price was not worth the trip or the food. I wish I could have gotten all my money back. Fortunately, I did get the money for the burger back. I will never eat there again.",

One of my friends had a milkshake which he said was very thin and really just chocolate milk, he drank less than half.  When the server was clearing the table it was clear to me that he was trying to clear too much at once, the result was the remaining milkshake was spilled all over my other friend.

    "text": "Aioli is without a doubt my absolute FAVORITE burger joint in all of Phoenix!  First things first- I'm a pescatarian and I absolutely love that they offer a meatless/vegetarian/vegan burger option that isn't a craptastic variation of a \"bean\" burger. Bean based burgers are almost always a culinary abomination- too messy, too crumbly, taste nothing like an actual \"burger\", too many weird chunks of food in there, they always fall apart after the first bite, taste is sometimes really bad, etc., etc.   Aioli doesn't bother with this nonsense. Instead they offer the Beyond Burger which is an excellent veggie friendly substitute you can find in some grocery stores.  Aioli has several great burgers that can be made with a Beyond patty instead of meat. My fave is the Italiano burger. It has fresh mozzarella, a yummy balsamic sauce, a basil garlic aioli, and a tomato (I leave off the bacon, obvs). This thing is delicious! I am addicted!  I've tried most of their sides- the traditional fries, the sweet potato fries, the onion rings (I think they are not on the menu all the time), the elote, and the roasted farm veggies and literally everything is so tasty. I can't believe how good the food is here considering it seems like \"just\" a burger joint.  They also make amazing and unique shakes and floats. The birthday cake milkshake has actual pieces of cake at the top and it is so freaking yummy I can't even deal. One of the best shakes I've ever had!  I also have to say, the service here is fabulous. Her name escapes me but every time I go in, the nice blonde lady at the counter is SO welcoming and sweet! She makes you feel like a part of the family. I went on my birthday last month and she overheard that it was my special day and at the end of our meal brought me a complimentary piece of cheesecake since she's seen me there a few times. SO NICE! I am bowled over by her kindness every time we visit. I hope this place stays around for a long time and potentially expands. It can get crowded quickly since it's in a small space, but maybe they will open new locations or move to a bigger space (STILL IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD PLEASE!) in the near future.   Love love love AIOLI!",

Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad -- but it wasn't that great either, definitely not worth the drive from south Phoenix. There was some seating outside; inside there wasn't much -- but there was a bridal shower happening. Yes, a bridal shower. I looked at my friends and said if hell freezes over & I ever get married, if they had my bridal at Aioli, I'd b*tch slap each & every one of them. That oddity + the kid screaming like a banshee totally turned me off of this place. I also don't like the plastic utensils they had. I think restaurants need to start being more environmentally conscious & make better choices when it comes to sustainability.",

The atmosphere is great, it wasn't too busy and we didn't have to wait long for our food! Definitely our favorite burger place in town!",

    "text": "Do yourself a favor and the next time you're brain storming on where to eat out- choose Aioli Burgers. I love supporting local in AZ and am so happy to see a store front come out of this successful business.   We dined on a Monday afternoon and the place was busy, a great sign! All of the food came out so quick, we were both super impressed! My boyfriend had the California burger- BOMB. I had the classic burger to start with, but the next time I come back I will surely try one of their specialty burgers! We also got the wedge salad, and the loaded fries...... make sure you order the loaded fries.  Clean, spacious restaurant with friendly service. They have gluten free and vegan options as well!  I think the best part about this business is their reasonable pricing for the quality of food their putting out. Every other burger joint in AZ charges so much to add an extra sauce or topping to your burger, and Aoili does this reasonably. Every single thing we ordered was so worth it.  Great job, Aoili Burger!!!! I look forward to eating your delicious food again soon, and I will make sure to tell everyone I know in the area and beyond about this place!",

This may not be the best review because it's been over a week since we've gone here but I can tell you that it's a place I'll visit again.   I went with the White Truffle Swiss burger with sweet potato fries and my fiance decided on the California burger with regular fries. The young lady that helped us with our order told us that they had a $10 special going on that included the fries so it was nice that we were both able to get the fries we enjoy for a deal.   I thought my burger was very enjoyable and would get it again. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crisp and not limp like some other burger joints.   Brian said his burger was not memorable. He said he is willing to come back and try the Italiano burger. We also didn't care for the aioli dipping sauce either.   The place is tucked away in the corner of the plaza and there isn't a lighted sign with their name up so look for the banner.",

    "text": "UPDATE: Went back today after receiving an incredibly generous gift card and note from the manager asking to try again.  That was incredible customer service!!!  Five stars for that!!! When we got there, we were greeted immediately and the manager was very friendly.  We ordered a burrata caprese salad, an aioli burger, the special hatch green chili burger, and a chocolate malt shake.  The food came pretty quickly and it was MUCH better this time.  I chose to not do the lettuce bun this time, but the other burger was lettuce wrapped.  Burgers were cooked well, the aiolis on both were good, the burrata salad was DELICIOUS and the malt was divine!!  I think we definitely must have gone on a bad day last time because the food today was MUCH better!!!  Very much recommend the hatch chili burger and the burrata caprese salad!!    I have been trying to eat at Aioli Burger for awhile; the first time, I called for take out and was on hold for 17 minutes (they forgot about me!) When I finally hung up, they called me back and left a message apologizing like 45 minutes later.  Then I called for takeout again a few days later and they told me they were closing in 20 minutes and wouldn't take the order.  I was getting frustrated but am doing low carb and really craved a lettuce wrap burger so called again last night.  Between two of us, we ordered: the Classic Aioli burger and the Italiano burger, both pink, both lettuce wrapped.  And we shared farmhouse veggies.  I honestly am not sure I have had a worse burger experience in a long time.  My burger (the italiano) was room temp at best, the mozz cheese was melted on top but was cold (actually cold!), the tomatoes were bad, the aioli was bland.  And the lettuce, my goodness!  It was like that lettuce you used to get as a garnish on your dishes at Shoneys back in the 90s!  And the bacon, no joke, tasted like a hotdog.  The other burger was better, the onion jam was delicious.  I will say they were both cooked well, as in were actually pink, though mine was not warm.  (I do realize there is a slight risk of this when you order takeout so I can actually understand that to an extent).  Then...the veggies...oh the veggies.  I literally threw them away!!  I think they are frozen veggies that get thrown into a microwave and then come w some sauce that has literally no flavor.  It was just not good.  I feel bad because I REALLY wanted to like this place but I definitely had a bad experience.  I think all bad reviews deserve a second chance so I'll try it again next time in the restaurant and see if that makes a difference.  I will say, the fries looked delvi",

It came with the best cheese sauce I have ever had! They could serve it as a beverage, LOL! Next, I had the iced tea. It was even delicious! Most places have watered down tea, the tea here has a depth and richness that you don't find at most restaurants.       I ordered the truffle mushroom burger. I love the fact that you can order your burgers to the temperature that you like, not the temperature they feel like giving you. My burger was cooked to perfection. The buns are soft, fresh, and amazing! The flavor was exquisite! I also ordered the loaded fries. They were so delicious. Again, they were drizzled with the amazing cheese sauce, bacon, avocado ( which I had them take off because I do not care for them) and pickled onions. Again, they knocked it out of the ballpark. My husband had the Aioli burger, he loved it. Our son had the Fresh Prince, it was awesome. And his girlfriend had the Californian, which she loved. This is definitely our new favorite placed. We have been to a lot of burger places throughout Arizona and this is definitely at the top of the list!",

It was raining, and at the end of the rainbow...Aioli Gourment Burgers (photo included), so we gave this little place a try, without even checking it out first on YELP!! Yikes!!!  We were pleasantly surprised by the cute, clean environment, and the nice staff.  The burgers were amazing!  Real ground beef taste and a thick patties on a delicious bun, served in cute little metal trays.    Definitely would like to try other items on the menu, I recommend you give this place a try.",

When we got our burgers they were really small for a gourmet burger, but that i can live with if its a great tasting burger. This was not the case the Patties were small, grey, chewy and tasted frozen, it left me wishing I had gone with a  buck in and out burger.   I will say the shake was great but that's about it. Wont be going back feel bamboozled. hope these guys take note and do better.",

Amd even a \"Furry Friends\" side with biscuits, apples and peanut butter. Where else you gonna go?",

Let's start that it's Kobe beef fresh made to order, this place just took first place in the battle of the burgers challenge and also recently won best food in the recent scottsdale culinary festival! I decided to try and it definitely lived up to its reputation. I ordered the prince which consisted of a Kobe beef patty (I ordered a extra patty) with shaved rib eye on top caramelized onions their famous Aioli spread fresh aged cheddar on delicious toasted brioche bun yummy goodness dripping down your hands! Great people the owner greeted us at the register n was very hospitable. If you're a burger lover You gotta try it!!",

On top of that the manager gave us some fries and even an extra cannoli on top of the milkshake for us to try!

Ridiculous!!!  It was so good that I didnt even feel guilty eating it at a table outside with a view of the gym next door and watching people working out.  4 of us shared the bread pudding too. It was a huge serving, really good but super rich. We could only eat a couple of bites and brought the rest home.   Oh, my other daughter and her friend got the kids chicken fingers and fries and they enjoyed it very much.",

We were greeted warmly and since it was our first time visiting, the gal who greeted us took the time to review several things on their menu and offered some terrific suggestions.  My friend and I ordered two different burgers and split them (Black & Blue and the California) and both were delicious.  We also split an order of Aioli's Fry Flight with the sweet potato fries and they were out of this world!  If I said everything wonderful I experienced during this visit, this review would be 5 pages long!  I will most definitely be going back again and again to this restaurant. One final thing...for those who love food trucks....they also have a food truck! There's a calendar on their website that shows when/where it will be.",

I had the Italiano and was expecting tons of flavor and it just wasn't there. The burger was dry and the bun was nothing special. The sweet potato fries were underwhelming and the sauce was just ok. My husband had a plain bacon cheese burger and regular fries and he really enjoyed it but still only gave it a three and a half rating. The staff is awesome and the atmosphere is nice but the burgers just aren't up to par for us. We might go back to try other burgers on the menu but more than likely not.",

I heard this place has great food and decided to check it out. My mistake had no idea that they close at 8:00 and we literally walked in at 7:59 and we're behind people ordering and when they were done ordering we thought we were next! We approached the counter and the young girl behind the counter told us she cannot take our order because they close at 8:00! I looked at the time and it was 8:02 ARE YOU KIDDING? She told us the people before us were the last order ( even though we were in line behind them) and \"That's coming from the chef\" is what she told us! I cannot believe that they would turn us away and not even offer to make our food to go! As good as they may be, I cannot see myself supporting an establishment with this type of culture! We drove out of our way and were turned away! We will go to our usual burger joint with EXCELLENT service called Hopdoddy!",

Quality ingredients such as Maytag blue cheese. You can select between Kobe beef, chicken or a vegan patty for your burger. You can't go wrong upgrading to the sweet potato fries.  There's a small outdoor patio that is kid and dog friendly. A combination of dog biscuits, peanut butter and apple slices is available for the dogs, even though I have yet to see a dog who will eat the apples:) The simple kids menu consists of a burger, chicken strips and grilled cheese, one of which should satisfy any child. Adult salads also.  From humble food truck origins, it's great to be able to enjoy Aioli's brick & mortar location.",

The guy at the register seemed to know how to place the order and was very energetic. I ordered the Italian burger with roasted veggies sometimes normally would not but soooo glad I did. I still got to try everyone else's fries which were hot and tasty but I felt like the roasted veggies were such a tasty unique and healthy side choice! Loved the balsamic glaze and motzerreIla  I didn't even miss the usual ketchup mustard pickle..wish other burger places would do this. Only complaint we wanted all aioli on the side in case we don't eat whole meal but it was put on it. Looking forward to our next visit keet up the quality of meat !!",

One thing that I absolutely despise is underdone hamburgers, so last weekend I ordered a well-done Aioli Burger with loaded fries. When the burger was served, it was barely warm, cold and pink, and the \"loaded fries\" were nothing more than cold, soggy fries covered with Velveeta-type liquid cheese and two tiny bits of avocado. When I complained to the server, she said she'd get me another hamburger. After 15 minutes of waiting I just left. I guess they just couldn't be bothered with serving their customers decent, hot food. What a waste of time and money.  I wouldn't waste my time with this place unless you like raw hamburgers with cold soggy fries covered with goopy Cheez Whiz type stuff. Heck, maybe you even like horrible service in which the server says she'll help you then disappears. However, maybe there are some people out there who actually like food and service like that.",

My husband got the loaded fries and I was literally scraping every last morsel of the yummy cheese off of the dish!  We also had a sample of the lemonade and it was very tasty.  And the bad:   I ordered the Italiano burger.  The burger was by far the weakest part of the meal.  While the seasonings and cheese were good, the actual burger patty itself was bland and somewhat dry. I prefer my beef patties flavored and juicy.  It was almost inedible.  And I love bread, but the bun was too big and not that appetizing.  I ended up only eating a portion of the bun.  Overall: The restaurant is cute and I like supporting local businesses.  I would go back to have sides and or appetizers (I want to try the mac&cheese, as well as the pretzels).  However, I would never pay such a steep price for a less than mediocre hamburger!    5 Stars for sides 2 Stars for the burger",

    "text": "We visited Last night wanting to support the new neighborhood spot.    Four stars based on the service and friendly staff.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt on everything else since it was super busy and clear they have some kinks to work out.  When we arrived, the line to order was back to the door and moving slowly.   It took almost 25 minutes to get our food ordered.  We were fortunate to find a seat while we waited, and waited, and waited.  At that point the seating had become a free for all.  If it's always this busy they'll need a different approach.  When our food arrived, around 35 minutes after we ordered our burgers weren't hot.  They did taste great though... a little on the salty side.  The fries were good too but also not hot.  Definitely some kinks to work out as one would expect in a new restaurant.  We will go back at a less busy time and I'll update this review.",

And, although I live in the area of Shea/32 (as do the owners) and have for 39 years, I tried Aioli for the first time a few days ago.  It is every bit as good.  And, for a gourmet bacon cheddar burger, very reasonably priced.  The only things it can't match are Majerle's punch card for a free burger when you reach \"Thunder 9\" and its lunch discounts with the card.  And the ambiance of a fancy sports bar.  But then, it's a quicky stop at the counter for a delicious burger.",

They have burgers, fries, shakes and some other options.   I went with one of their special burgers, The Dad Burger, instead of playing it safe. The Dad came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, sriracha honey peanut butter, apricot preserves, and arugula. I wasn't quite sure how I was going to like the flavor... but it was amazing! I was so glad I ordered it. A little sweet, a little spicy, it was honestly the perfect mix. Hopefully I'll be able to grab this again before it's off the menu.   I also ordered the sweet potato fries with a side of garlic aioli. They were pretty dang good!  My girlfriend got a plain cheeseburger and regular fries. She thought it was pretty solid. We also got the Cookie Monster Shake. It was tasty but we couldn't finish it. We were stuffed by the end of the meal. If you factor in a burger, fries and a drink you're looking at around $15 or so per person depending on what you order, but I think it's worth it!  Overall, definitely check this place out!!!",

We even got offered a \"Passport to goodness\" food stamp card. We can definitely see ourselves coming back to fill it up!  5 stars for food and ambiance-The burgers were amazing! There was live music and it was awesome. We got the New Mexico and Falafel burgers with beer-battered onion rings.   ZERO STARS for the lady taking our orders, an older blonde. She was unbelievably rude! She made us feel like taking our order was an inconvenience. We tried to be friendly and offer a smile but she wasn't having it- not even a smile. I almost wanted to cancel our order and leave because of how uncomfortable and awkward she made us feel!    Overall, the place, the food and all the OTHER staff was great!   I wish I could give this AGB 5 stars but our experience with the lady, it made us want to get out of there ASAP",

    "text": "Vegan review: Aioli Burgers offers the Beyond Burger as a vegan option! It's so nice to have a neighborhood place that we can eat at!  There has been some discussion on Facebook about if their buns are vegan or not, but I stopped by for some emergency fries (I was starving) a week ago and someone who seemed like an owner or manager told me the buns are vegan. As a result, I went back to try the burger this week!  The restaurant offers a variety of toppings, but as a vegan I just started with the \"classic\" minus cheese and dressing. The server was great about making suggestions, so I added grilled onions, ketchup and mustard. I was also clear with her that I'm vegan, and she said she'd mark the ticket so they'd cook it on a clean grill. I also ordered fries.  The burger was delicious! I had it cooked well done, but it was still pink because, well, it's not meat! It was nice and warm inside, but perfectly grilled outside. I've had the Beyond Burger at home before and thought it was just okay, but having it professionally grilled made a big difference! All the toppings were good. The grilled onions were thin and flavorful, and a generous portion. I should have asked for extra pickles, as there were only a couple. The bun was warm and soft. I do have a bit of doubt on if it was vegan or not - it seemed a bit eggy. The fries are perfect. They're lightly coated in what I assume was corn starch, and fried to a crisp.   The service was excellent! The server noticed that I was sharing with my husband, who arrived after me, and offered to have the kitchen split the burger. The food came out quickly, and the server brought an extra tray for us to divide the food.  The only thing stopping me from making this a five star review is that I'd like to see them add more vegan options i.e. vegan cheese and maybe some interesting sauces/aiolis? I was sad to have to stick to ketchup and mustard. If they did, I'd probably become a regular!",

    "text": "Aioli has been making rounds on food truck circuit for quite some time now. However, it wasn't until I found out that they opened an actual location did we actual go out of our way to finally give them a try.  The concept is pretty straight-forward. They serve burgers, fries, and few appetizers, as well as a few desserts/shakes. I guess what sets them apart, or what is supposed to set them apart, is their variety of aioli-based sauces that they use. I get it. I've always liked aioli, but in comparison to a lot of other burger places, I wasn't quite as blown away as I had hoped.  My girlfriend and I ordered their 3 cheese mac and cheese bites, which are pretty self-explanatory and actually pretty good for what they are.   For burgers, I opted for the California, while my girlfriend ordered the basic Aioli burger. When ordering, they ask if you want your burger cooked as \"pink or no pink.\" Now, I'm all for steaks to be cooked in the medium range, but when it comes to actual ground beef, I've just never been comfortable with anything below medium-well. Therefore, we both played it safe and went with \"no pink.\"  Now, I'm not sure if this is where we went wrong, but I'll reiterate what another reviewer said when they referred to their patties as \"petrified.\" All the juice and flavor were apparently cooked right out of them, leaving us with two very dry beef patties that, despite having acceptable ingredients, were really just no different than any other mid-tier fast food burger.  This seems very odd, as many places are able to cook their burgers well-done and still manage to contain flavor and juice, so I'm not entirely sure what went wrong here.  Afterwards, I was looking at their price points and see that they're actually charging similar prices to what you'd find at a more upscale burger joint. So, clearly they see themselves on par with your \"gourmet\" joints around the Valley. Although after trying them, I don't consider them to be anywhere close to that level.  There were positives, however. The fries were fine. The lady who took our order was very friendly and we were checked on quite regularly.  In the end, I'm not sure if I'd come back, but I guess they're worth trying out. Judging by their reviews, a lot of people seem to love them - but sadly, I'm just not one of them.  Bottom line: avoid their \"no pink\" patties at all costs!",

A well done burger shouldn't be pink, and a rare burger...well, hell...it's not grey in the middle, now is it?  Also seriously lacking in flavor for as much stuff is put on the burgers.  Salt and pepper on the patties would go a long way.  Also, why is every burger so greasy that everything slides out from in between the bun?  The fries are good, the prices are respectable, but it's not the world's answer to burger perfection.",

    "text": "Went there for the first time last night at 5:30 for a burger.  The counter guy asked if it was our first visit and mentioned happy hour.  My husband asked for a beer and the woman ran over and said it's past happy hour so  too late for the happy hour price.  It was 5:31 to be exact.  We weren't there for happy hour, didn't know it existed till he mentioned, so it seemed weird that she was johnny on the spot to get her extra $2.00 on a beer when the counter guy was the one that mentioned it.  So much for creating good will with a new customer.  We ordered two hamburgers one with a side of fries, one with a side of onion rings, and one beer.  The bill was $35.  Would have been okay but the burgers were lackluster at best.  Given how long it took to get our food we were expecting something fresh and tasty.  Instead the brioche buns were slightly stale. The burgers were so uniform in size and shape that clearly they are preformed and possibly frozen given the texture and dryness of them.  The toppings were the only thing that gave some flavor and moisture to the burgers.  The onion rings were good and so were the fries.  But $3.00 for a small portion of fries on the side was way too much.  These fries were nothing more than frozen fires.  They are stingy with the sauces dolling out about a tablespoon in a tiny cup.  Even with the ketchup because they \"make their own\".  It felt childish. The atmosphere offers nothing to make you feel good about spending $12-$15 for a burger and fries ordered at the counter and $5 for a bottle of beer (no glass offered).  These are not \"gourmet burgers\" so don't buy into the hype.  I'd rather spend half that much and get a fresh beef, crafted burger at McDonald's. And if you want to spend that much there are better places.",

Where things went wrong is when the appetizer came out. We ordered the aioli's fry flight. There were also fries on the sides option but there were two of us that were to be sharing and usually appetizers are meant for sharing. The fry flight is made up of golden crunchy fries that come with a flight of 5 flavored aioli's to dip in. I don't know why but all but one of the aioli's could be distinguished from one another. I believe the white truffle garlic aioli was the only one that didn't taste like just a plain mayonnaise. The main problem I had with the fries was that it was a ridiculously small portion of fries. The portion would have made sense if it was on the sides menu but it is on the appetizer menu. There were not even enough fries to come close to consuming the amount of aioli they give you. All in all I will not stop coming here as they do make an epic burger but I will not be ordering from the fry menu unless they stop skimping out on the proportions.",

The burgers aren't necessarily huge, but sooo tasty and I need room for those fries! Vintage sodas in a case out front, my favorite brand of iced tea China Mist, and outstanding chocolate malt are some of the satisfying drinks I've enjoyed here. That's just the food, ownership places huge value on service! The young folks that work there treat you like family at the kitchen counter. You get that same personal touch no matter how crowded it gets. So yeah, I like em.",

It seemed like an interesting story: lifelong friends deciding to open up a burger joint in the neighborhood they grew up in. We drove out of our way to see if it would live up to the hype. It absolutely did.  I ordered the White Truffle Swiss Burger, and my wife had the Aioli Burger, along with French fries. The burgers were excellent. They were served piping hot and fresh, and the fries were crispy and tasty. The service was fast and accurate; our food was delivered quickly and with a smile. The restaurant was clean and bright. We both love a good burger, and this place just shot up to the top of our go-to list.",

I'm awful with names but the blonde woman up front was so very friendly and excellent customer service. She checked on us half way through the meal to make sure everything turned out great and even came and grabbed our trash at the end. We brought our 6month old so she was very sweet and engaging with him when she popped by our table. Gave us lots of compliments. (:   Both my husband and I got the Italiano burger which was INCREDIBLE! The fresh mozzarella, bacon, balsamic glaze, and the aioli all so yummy! Great size burger too! I paired my burger with the sweet potato fried which were the best I have had. Super good!   I even gave my son small bites of my burger deconstructed and he approved! Big fan especially of the tomato's. Lol  Overall everything was delicious and looking forward to come back and try more. Thank you!",

Prices are very affordable and a nice selection of beers and wine.  I went with the build you own burger topped with bacon and an over-easy egg with a side of fries. Remember to ask for there aioli sauces on the side. My garlic aioli tasted wonderfully with the fries. All in all loved the place and the food it offered. A neighborhood gem! Cheers",

I've had the fresh prince, I think it's called, and what ever was the burger of the day (something with Jalapenos).   The place can get packed but the service still runs smooth. Two things keeping this place from a 5 star. The burgers are kinda prices $11ish dollars (just the burger sides are extra). The second thing is I feel the fries are too salty. That might be more personal, maybe you like salty fries.   Even at $11ish a burger they are good and we will be coming back.",

The inside was very clean and inviting. The menu was a little smaller than I'm used to seeing at a fast casual place like this. Having said that, I ordered the aioli burger, a side of fries, and a drink. After a tip it came to $19.   The burger was very good! I ordered it medium and it came out perfectly cooked. The aioli jam they use was delicious, and the bacon was the perfect crispness. The French fries were also delicious! Crispy and seasoned well. If I had to nitpick, I'd recommend having more soda/beverage options. Maybe either one of those Coke machines with a bunch of different flavors.  I really wanted to give them 5 stars, but my order did come out slightly wrong. I asked for no tomatoes on my burger, and it came out with tomatoes.  Having said all that. The food is really quite good!",

It's a clean, bare-bones, casual  type of eatery with numerous versions of a burger to choose from. Since I am the only one in my family that likes blue cheese, I ordered the black and blue burger.  Cooked perfectly, it oozed with melted Maytag blue cheese that was covered with caramelized onions and bacon. I shared hubby's fries, but the manager also brought over a complimentary side of sweet potato fries. Yes, I ate these delicious, calorie-loaded goodies--but only so I wouldn't hurt her feelings. Everyone enjoyed their burgers. Service was good and staff was friendly. Why bother to cook if you don't have to.",

We were greeted immediately upon entering the door and the lady was very nice, even telling us what the special burger and shake was for the day.   This is another fast casual restaurant, order at the counter, seat yourself with your number and they bring you your food (they do also remove plates).   I got the classic aioli with the beyond patty and my boyfriend got the aioli burger. They were both delicious, nice portion, he wanted his a little pink and it was cooked perfect. It took about 15 min for our burgers but they were hot and fresh. I did not like that they upcharge for the nonbeef patty ($2) as $9 for a burger is pretty steep considering it doesn't come with anything else. We ordered the sweet potato fries which were very salty and also not hot, barely even warm. We also got the peanut butter chocolate milkshake, which was so good- however ours came with vanilla ice cream not chocolate like the menu stated and I thought $6 was kinda expensive for a shake filled 3/4 way and the rest with whipped cream. We didn't ask for another one as it was still good but it wasn't what the menu stated.",

    "text": "My wife was out of town so kids number 3 and 4 and I went out for food. They couldn't agree on where initially, which was one of the rules to be able to go out, but then got together to okay going to Aioli Burger.  I ordered a Classic burger with an impossible patty. Not meat, but actually tastes like meat. It was tasty.  Number 3 ordered the Italiano. She described it as a tomato basil salad  on a bun. I don't really get that, but she thinks it is good. She said it hit the spot and if you like tomato basil salad this is the burger for you.  Number 4 ordered the Aioli Junior Cheeseburger. He said the cheese was cooked well on the burger. He liked it and are the whole thing.  They both ordered a side a fries. They both liked them. Number 3 said they are a bit too crispy for here, but really good anyway. Number 4 said all good, but they needed a pinch more salt.  So it was a successful trip to the Aioli Burger. Check it out!",

Upon tasting our burgers, it was very clear why people can't get enough. They cook your patty to order, the buns are buttered and toasted and it was delicious. They have 6 different kinds of aioli sauce - the garlic was amazing. Also liked that they had good lemonade as well as offering beer and wine. Will definitely go again!",

Garlic aioli and peppercorn were the best. Great pesto sauce.  Ordered fried cheese. Was a little hard but the panko bread crumbs had a good flavor.  Overall good burger not great. Will go back.",

My parents and I got the Italiano burger and my husband got the Aioli burger - all of us ordered loaded fries. There were no complaints, except for my Dad who didn't really care for the fries (but he put ketchup on them, so his fault!). Everything was really delicious and cooked well. I ordered the burgers medium to medium-rare and they were closer to medium-medium-well but they were juicy and tasty and so who cares.   The loaded fries were $4 and you get a fair amount, but I might try an appetizer or a salad next time. Also, the lemonades are really tasty (I'm sure the shakes are too but I need to pace myself!).  Overall really delicious and since we live less than two miles away, we'll be back frequently! We might have to start walking there, though.",

The only complaint I have,  is a common problem with every outdoor seating restaurant in Phoenix and PV,  the flies.   Unless the owners fog their patio and use strong repellant candles,  this time of year you will have to keep your food covered in napkins as you eat.  I am even to the point with outside seating to bring my own spray and douse the table before eating.   You will love the burgers,  coke products and friendly staff here,  just bring a little deet :)",

This restaurant has some nice burger themed art and a very modern feel to the space.  I love the fast casual set up where there are no servers.  Makes it easy to get in and get out.    For our first foray into the restaurant, I had my standard (black & blue burger) and my wife got the italiano.  For sides, we got the mac & cheese bites and the aioli fry flight.    Burgers were fantastic per the usual.  This was the first time I tried the italiano burger and I have to give that one two thumbs up.  The mac & cheese bites are a welcome addition to their already stellar menu.    This is a great neighborhood restaurant and can only be improved by adding some booze to the menu!",

I tried the Falafel Burger with lettuce wrap instead of bun and for one dollar up charge I got the 3 Cheese Macaroni and Cheese Bites. It seemed like they hollowed out a WHOLE lettuce head for my sandwich (see photo) I adjusted the amount of lettuce and for the most part the Falafel Sandwich and Bites were delicious.....but then things go south fast.  We shared the Roasted Farm Vegetables. (see photo) They looked like broken down leftovers that were full of grease and were sort of burnt. The vegetables came with a very non-traditional romesco. (romesco is suppose to be a red pepper nut sauce)  My husband asked for his Aioli Burger with the aioli on the side but that request was ignored so he sent it back. Big mistake...I don't know what they did but it seemed like they washed the burger off and threw it back on the heat......because..... Instead of a \"Pink\" Burger (you order pink or well) he received a petrified burger and pulled it out of his sandwich and said to me that it was dryer than a Burger King Patty and too dry to feed our dogs. The girl working the counter said that she was sorry but it wasn't her fault because she ordered the burger correctly.  The other girl from the kitchen came out to clear the plates saw the dried up burger and said she'd make a new one but we were passing out the door to leave so we just left.  Aioli Burger made Delicious Fresh Burgers at the past Devoured Festival....I thought they'd be just as good from the restaurant but I was wrong.",

Once you decide on which one to have, settle down and tell your taste buds to get ready for treat.  Try some of the sauces with your \"mixed\" fries.  You will not be disappointed.  The Cardinal Game special looks like a good idea during season.  Bon Provecho!",

    "text": "This is a top burger destination. It is a gourmet burger, yet affordable and enjoyable place!  Their menu is simple and easy to choose from. Being a semi-vegetarian, we opted for the falafel burger as that looked interesting along with seasoned fries and farm fresh veggie roast. The falafel burger was fantastic - the chickpea was smashed well and the patty was well cooked. To go along with it, it was served with a side of smoked chilli pepper sauce..it was like Mexico meets Middle East! The loaded fries were delicious - so fresh and crispy that we finished off the whole bowl (and usually we seldom finish half the given plate)...very tempting and addictive fries. The farm fresh veggies were a blend of cauliflower, peppers and Brussel sprouts and were roasted to perfection. If you need a usual hamburger, I hear that is just divine here and the most popular is their signature aioli burger. The staff is very friendly here and they take care of you really well. There are Groupon coupons that you can take advantage  of..so don't forget that. I will definitely come here again!  Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Value: 5/5",

Everything tasted great. As for the Aioli, I'll say this: get everything on the side. Sounds high maintenance. Just do yourself the favor. I love condiments. I'm a fat girl that likes to dip my food into all kinds of side sauces. But Aioli may have been even more than I could handle. I liked the food and will probably go back if in that area. But I will get all sauces on the side and ever ask if the loaded fries can be adjusted. The Blonde working at the register was probably one of the nicest, friendliest person I've run into in awhile. Very helpful, friendly and seemed to care if we liked what we ordered. That was a nice change.",

How can you go wrong with pickled red onions, avocado and a fried egg! The first time I went into the restaurant I stayed consistent and got the California and it was amazing as usual. On my next visit though, they had a special called the Fresh Prince that sounded too good to pass up (shaved ribeye, pepper jack, onions, etc...kind of like a Philly Cheesesteak). It's hard for me to admit but I might like that burger more than the California! Finally if you are looking for a non burger option, the Aioli Wedge salad with chicken was fantastic as well. So glad they have a brick and mortar restaurant now! I will be coming her often!",

This place is right down the street in a plaza that has been cleaned up and looks great. I was impressed with how clean this place is when we first walked in. There was no line so we ordered right away. The woman behind the counter was very helpful and answered all of our questions. I decided to go with their Classic burger and an order of fries.  The food came very quickly and I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into it. The hamburger was hot and fresh... made to order. However, I thought the hamburger could have used more flavor. There was just nothing setting it apart from the others in the hamburger game. The fries were great. They were salty and hot, a nice compliment to the burger.  Overall, this was a great meal for a quick dinner. I would like to return to try some of their other hamburgers.",

My husband tried the Italiano and He really enjoyed it. Both times we got the fry flight and the first time it came with five different aiolis and a spicy ketchup. The second time we ordered it, it only came with four aiolis. Also the second time we went our burgers came out about five mins before our fry flight. Which was kind of annoying because we wanted the aiolis not just for our fries, but burgers as well so our burgers were cold by the time we were going to eat them. My parents who were with us were very perturbed by this. We tried a chocolate malt, the presentation was awesome and it tasted good. We'd probably try a different shake in the future.  Overall the only gripes we have are the inconsistency of getting an item and timing of getting food. It may have just been an off night that night.",

Perhaps next time (and there definitely will be a next time) we'll try out their Signature Loaded Fries (voted a customer favorite).

    "text": "Their burgers are a little pricey, but SO GOOD! Great customer service, too. I visited here with my brother for our Easter dinner this year, and we got there about 30 min before they closed (we didn't know what time they closed). We were enjoying our meal and watching the TV in the restaurant. We didn't hear any of the workers complain about us still being there close to closing. They were very kind and respectful. Great burgers, too! The California burger is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. And they have a healthy option (and vegan option) for each burger! Definitely going to be back at this place!",

    "text": "We were referred here by the Cheeseburger Chasers as the best burgers in AZ. Most of the group of nine said 4.5 stars. They have food for non-burger lovers as well. We tried the Aloha burger (pineapple, teriyaki etc), Fresh Prince (Philly cheesesteakish), California (avocado, egg), black/blue (which we ordered on lettuce), and simple bacon cheeseburger. They were all fresh and cooked medium. We also ordered sweet potato fries, onion rings, and they have us free golden fries and numerous sauces (basil aioli was unanimous best) which normally only come with the Fry Flight. Overall flavors tasty, but could have been a tad smokier, more flavorful cheese, and a little more salt. McKenzie River's Old Prospector burger still best but these were good. We also got Double Chocolate, Strawberry, and the special Cherry Bomb shake. The best was Strawberry which complimented the burgers well. Service was super friendly and very attentive. Definitely coming back!",

I was excited when I heard about their brick and mortar restaurant and they have lived up to the hype. Consistently great food and service, clean restaurant, and convenient location. I always get the Black and Blue burger which is amazing, so flavorful. Their golden fries are also quite good, just the right amount of crispy and they pair perfectly with your choice of aioli dipping sauce (my favorite is the white truffle!). I'm not the biggest fan of their milkshakes but the food more than makes up for that. I would absolutely recommend Aioli Burger!",

I especially loved the apple wood bacon jam, which was full of bacon! I got it served without the bun and it held up really well. My husband go the classic Aioli with no Aioli sauce, and apparently he felt it lacked flavor. I didn't think my burger did, so not sure if the patty itself is different, but I can only vouch for mine and it was great. The fries were also delicious...cooked perfectly and well salted.

I sat down and waited 40 minutes to get my order. People who got there after me got their orders before me. It turns out that they just left it on the counter. When I asked about it they said \"oh it's right here on the counter\". What am I supposed to do? Go up to the counter and grab the order? When they finally gave me my order, it was cold. They didn't even offer to remake it. I didn't even bother to argue about it and  took it home. When I look into the bag I find cheese on my burger... so I wasted over an hour and around 15 dollars for cold French fries  Thank you so much.",

Don't get me wrong, I love to have sauce and typically ask for extra from places I know that don't give you enough. Unfortunately, all of their dishes we received were almost overpowered.

The burgers were overcooked from what we asked and mostly flavorless. I got the white truffle Swiss burger which had almost no mushrooms on it and I couldn't even taste the aioli.  I'm not sure if the meat was seasoned or not but all I could taste was the caramelized onion. My brother had the California burger and agreed that the meat was flavorless. The side of roasted vegetables was actually pretty good along with the romesco sauce, but the fries seemed premade. Overall it was okay but did not seem to match the price point. There are other burger places at a similar price that I would rather have.",

My wife had the Aioli and I had the White Truffle Swiss. Both were very good, lots of flavor but very well balanced. The Roasted Farm Vegetables were also surprisingly very good as a side dish - brussel sprouts, cauliflower and some other good stuff.
