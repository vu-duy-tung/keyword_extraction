    "text": "We were looking forward to eating here because of the good reviews. But we found the food mixed. Also you can't really call it \"authentic\" with the selection of Sushi Rolls it offers. Most of them don't exist in Japan. I expected more from a Japanese owned sushi restaurant.   The fish itself was fresh, but the rolls we ordered were poorly made and were coming unrolled. Messy on the plate, and difficult to eat. No, they weren't overstuffed, just normal rolls, except for the Crazy Roll, which surprisingly was the best one of all. Tasty & well made.  The Spicy Tuna wasn't very spicy. The Spicy Scallop had a drop of hot sauce on it that looked so much like blood, I couldn't try it. The real crab in the California Roll was so dry that it ruined it.  The Negi Toro was tasteless, the Negi Yellowtail, the same. The Unagi  was sloppily cut. The Chirashi Sushi was smaller than other restaurants where we've eaten. Plus, they forgot my husband's order of oysters.   On the other hand, the salad was good because the dressing wasn't over sweet, and the edamame tasted fresh. Not a reason to drive to North Scottsdale for dinner.",

    "text": "Thank goodness for Yelp! This was such a great find. I had a looooong day at work, missed lunch, and was starving on my way back to my hotel. Stopped in to place an order to go. The hostess was UBBER friendly! I mean, I wasn't even at a table so didn't need waiter service, but they were so nice! Offered my water while I waited and overall just really nice staff.  Now onto the food: I was a little disappointed in the sushi/roll options. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that I did order to-go and maybe they had more options at the sushi bar that I wasn't privy to, but from the menus, there was much. I settled on my go-to safe choice rainbow roll, seaweed salad, and salmon dinner. Told you I was hungry! The roll was great, but hey, it's a simple standard roll. My fav was the salmon. It was a nice piece of fish, almost like they skinned it right off of Nemo! Even had the skin on it, which I actually like. Came with salad, rice, and miso soup, which I thought smelled a little funny in the car ride, but it was VERY tasty!   I did think the food was slightly pricey, but hey, most sushi places are. I will certainly be back to Hiro and this time dine-in. Thanks Yelp!",

Phenomenal taste and blend of flavors. Good quality fish selected for the sushi, and everything blended together nice, it didn't taste like eating rice, seaweed, and fish seperately like other places.  The place is smaller so come earlier or right when they open to avoid waiting.  The sushi is reasonably priced, and service was fast and great!

However, being from San Francisco I am not quite as taken by it. It's a good sushi place, and that's all it is. The quality of the fish seems fairly average. I did try the miso soup and shrimp tempura both of which were quite good. The caterpillar, rainbow, and philly rolls however were nothing special, although the spicy yellowtail roll was great. The service was wonderful, everyone was really friendly, and the decor of the restaurant was nice - transporting you far away from the drab parking lot exterior. The prices are fairly high, though. The special rolls such as the rainbow roll is around $13 and their famous diamond back roll is a $18! Salmon nigiri is $5.50 I think which is more expensive than a lot of sushi restaurants I've been to in San Francisco. Overall it's a good sushi restaurant and clearly deserves 4 stars here in Scottsdale, although in San Francisco I would probably only give it 3 stars.",

It's obviously good enough for it to be crowded, but customer service was beyond horrible - what's the point of a reservation if you have to wait over 35 minutes for a table that was supposedly reserved?

We loved the crab sunumono, agedashi tofu, calamari, fried smelts and gyozo to start, and then fresh sushi - in the desert - was wonderful - especially the uni. I had heard about this place for 2 years and finally went - and it became of our best new discoveries in the past year. Hiro Sushi is not fancy, but it's good. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great. We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic. So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very \"Spicolli-like\" voice, \"uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight\"..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, \"dude, you're outta luck\"....  Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there...  So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... I'm sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!  Morale of the story is that Yasu's children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!",

Don't get me wrong, there wasn't really anything wrong with the food (albeit maybe the toro) but it was no way a meal that was memorable.  Received a salad as part of a dinner entree - way too much dressing.  There was enough for 4 salads.  Miso was yummy though.  The yellow tail was very good as was the unagi but the toro nigiri was chewy due to sinew...  I don't know why we keep trying the spider roll at anywhere but Sushi Sam's in San Mateo - it was just OK.  Trying the California roll with the tempura bits was a mistake when there were so many other items on the menu.  Ordered the oysters on the half shell special and that was decent but again, not particularly special.  Price wise I'd say it was moderate to expensive.  The bill for 2 adults and a 4 1/2 year old was $115 before tip.  There was only 1 large beer on the tab.  I'm a visitor and I don't believe I'd come back again.  For the price I'd want to have a taste of Roka Akor.  Hindsight is 20-20 but that might have been the better bet tonight...",

They had combination dinners served in bento boxes, perfect for my eight year old child and my sushi phobic spouse. I had the yellow tail sashimi, yellowtail nigiri, tuna nigiri, and a philly roll. It was all fantastic! The presentation was beautiful. The portions were generous. Everything was fresh and perfect! The staff were great! The host was friendly on the phone and answered all my questions. The wait staff never hovered but were prompt to take plates and keep our drinks coming. We ate at the bar. Chef Hiro was warm and welcoming. He and his staff made us feel we were dining with friends. The location is in a safe part of town on the north east corner of Via Linda and 90th Street in Scottsdale. We will definitely be going back!",

The sushi chefs are authentic Japanese, and the ingredients are extremely fresh. Rarely have I found a sushi joint this far from the sea that has Ahi that has ZERO fishy smell. They are flexible with adapting if you want a custom roll. One of the chefs even turned a regular ahi sashimi dish in to a rose for me and my girlfriend. The prices are fair and they have several Japanese beers that are delicious. If you are a sushi fan, you owe it to yourself to check this place out. Sit at the sushi bar, its great to watch these guys work.",

There is often a substantial wait - I had a 15-minute wait at 8:30 on a weeknight, attesting to it's popularity with those in-the-know.  They have several sushi chefs working simultaneously, and the nigiri and maki start arriving quickly.  My favorite was the unagi, with the maguro and some of the specialty rolls not far behind.  In addition to maki, nigiri and sashimi, the also have other Japanese food available, such as tempura.    This is a real sushi place of the quality you'd find in San Francisco or Seattle, though they make the concession to the local market of calling things by their English names (i.e. Tuna rather than maguro).  The restaurant is a small business (family run?), and it shows - the staff know each other well and have been working together for a long time.    It's a great little place, and I recommend it.",

Took less than 3 minutes to get seated at the sushi bar. My order drink order was taken quickly and I received a pleasant greeting from the sushi chefs. My server was very bubbly, but didn't ask many questions or provide additional insight on the menu or lunch specials.  I deferred choosing by selecting the Chirashi bowl. The miso soup was very hot, had excellent broth flavor with fresh green onions and large pieces of tofu!  The chirashi bowl was a little under-welming at first glance, but each piece of fish was delicious, with the exception of what I presume was red snapper. It was a much chewier than I was expecting and the flavor wasn't at the same level as the other fish.   My salad showed up after my Chirashi bowl, and I hadn't expected to eat much of it, but the flavor of the dressing was really special. I ended up eating all of the salad and would gladly come back just for the the starters.  The total cost was just shy of $20, which I would gladly play again! Came hungry and curious and left fat and happy.  I will definitely be back to eat here again!",

The sushi chefs are knowledgable and very passionate.   The salmon sashimi was really fresh and generously cut. I also ordered the monk fish pate - served steamed with miso or ponzu sauce. If you're feeling adventurous, just ask the chef to surprise you with a roll! I was surprised with the tuna tempura sashimi roll and it was fabulous! Not really a fan of tempura rolls but it was very light!   Will definitely be back!!",

I made a reservation for 2 at 5p.m. and was the first person who arrived. First hint that tells me they are legit was seeing a group of Japanese guys waiting for it to open when i arrived. Second hint - shortly after the door was opened, the restaurant was already packed.   We ordered Aghi tofu and spicy squid as our appetizers. The aghi tofu is definitely the best I've ever had. The \"spicy squid\" that we ordered was not spicy at all. Nevertheless, I still like it. It was seasoned well and very juicy. Just the right amount of portion for appetizers. For our main entree, we ordered a sashimi combo to share and replace two pieces of clams with two additional pieces of tuna and yellow tail ($1 for each item you switch out, what a deal). Every single piece is fresh, delicious, and literally melts in your mouth. I cannot be any happier to order that. We also ordered Eel sushi (2 pieces each order) and it was cooked exactly to our liking. I love the eel sauce that comes with it. Super delicious!!!!   I was a bit disappointed that the hostess did not tell our waitress that it was my friend's birthday. I reminded them upon reservation as well a reminding the hostess when i arrived. When our waitress gave us the bill, I told her that it was my friend's birthday. She politely took the bill away and arrived with the tempura ice-cream. Even though she didn't bring back the \"green tea\" ice-cream that we specifically asked for, it was still delicious. They literally shut off all the lights at the restaurant and sing to my friend along with the guests. She was sooooo happy.  Overall, this has been a wonderful experience for my friends and I. You bet I'll come back here again. Thank you for the wonderful time!",

Let me start by saying if you go during peak dinner hours you'll be waiting a good 30-40 minutes to sit down for a party of 2-3.  They don't have much seating inside, but if you're patient it is worth the wait.  The service was on point from the moment we sat down.  We met Mr. Hiro himself and he actually made our sushi! Very nice guy and very humble.  Everything that we ordered was fresh and delicious.  The oysters, the shishitou peppers, the king crab roll the caterpillar roll & to start a warm bowl of miso soup.  They also have great specials to choose from.  I'm a big sushi fan and this place earns its 5 stars for service, fresh sushi & great atmosphere.",

This isn't a typical Scottsdale \"night club\" that just happens to serve sushi... you know who I am talking about! This is a True master's class on how fish should taste!  The staff is always friendly and despite how busy they are always manages to create a nice experience.

    "text": "I can't believe how underwhelmed I was when I initially visited Hiro.  Since that time, it has become one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona.  Besides more \"fast food\" type options, Hiro is one of our most frequented dining experiences and a constant reservation when we have guests.    One thing that you have to get past, is that it is in a strip mall.  The overall atmosphere when you first arrive leaves a little to be desired.  Once you enter, you are transported to a completely different area.  This does not feel like Arizona (especially Scottsdale) once inside.  It is small and dark and smells like sushi.  Sitting at the sushi bar is a must-do if you are there as a couple.  It is fun to interact with the employees making sushi.    We typically order the salmon skin roll (try it - its awesome!), the veggie roll (also great!), some sort of salmon nigiri, the tofu agedashi (another thing I highly recommend to anyone) and whatever sort of nigiri they recommend to us that night.  We have tried all sorts of non-menu items including fermented soybean rolls (not sure the actual name for that).  If you have any favorites, just ask, they always seem very willing to accommodate people's whims.  I also insist on the moshi before we go.  I'm sure its nothing special in terms of moshi in general, but its a favorite dessert of mine!    One tip - if you are interested in going, you will want a reservation.  If you can't (or don't) get one, you will likely have to wait or you may even get turned away if they have no tables opening up.  You cannot reserve the sushi bar - its first come first served, but its still typically a decent wait as well.  Reservations are definitely recommended and worth it!  If you can't get in, try Andreoli's across the street!",

The sushi and sashimi were fresh, tender, flavorful, delicious. I think the eel was my favorite. The rice was amazing, perfectly vinegared. The staff and chef were friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Been coming here quite frequently because of two things: 1) Quality of fish. I only order sashimi usually hamachi, maguro and sake(salmon) Generous pieces and very good quality 2) Chirashi is so tasty and perfect portions. If you dine in, the miso soup is one of the best in Phoenix: not overly salty or heavy taste.  If you just want rolls or nigiri sushi, there are many places in town that are decent but if you want quality, go to Hiro.  Only negative is their tempura which tends to be soggy almost uncooked, unlike True tempura which should have delicate, light feathery coating. I've tried shrimp tempura twice and the coating is gummy and thick.  I will not be ordering it until they teach the person how to make it properly!  The place is on the small size but that's better for sashimi/ sushi experience. It shouldn't feel like a mass production. Servers are friendly and attentive, filling water or hot tea regularly without having to ask. Overall a nice quiet place to enjoy the special taste of high quality fresh raw fish!",

I always order the sushi dinner the first time I go to a sushi restaurant, gives me a feel for the sushi chef and the balance of a complete meal. The dressing in the salad was the best thing we ate all night, it would have been better on cucumbers with sesame seeds instead of iceberg. The miso soup needed salt and the tofu was bland and too big. The fish wasn't the freshest, the surf clam was really hard to eat. The nigiri had no wasabi in it and the wasabi that came on the plate was not fresh made and was very mild. And my favorite mackerel was bitter which made me sad. The atmosphere was good, the service was wonderful.  I think I was expecting so much more because of all the incredible reviews and I was not impressed.",

I do recommend getting an appetizer or getting plates you can share as most plates come one and a time so one person may be eating and yhe other person may not have anything, which if that doesn't bother you than awesome, some people however it might.

Ignore the fact that there are so few tables and the host/hostess at the front can be a little bit terse at times.    Once you get seated, you'll be treated to moutwateringly amazing sushi that rivals some of the best I've had in cities with much more direct access to fresh seafood (Seattle, LA, San francisco).  Everything we ordered was delicious and it was so good, I ended up here for dinner here twice in the same week.  My only hesitation in writing this review is that it will encourage more people to dine here which will make it harder for me to get a table :)",

We have been here 4 times and have had to wait an hour or gotten take out because they are closed to seating. During the cooler months there's just no way you are getting in here so don't even bother. They do accept reservations but def book WAY ahead to get your preferred date & time. Ok, enough about that, sorry to be a debbie downer there, but you gotta know what to expect. I can't fault this place for it's incredible popularity. The prices are reasonable and the portions are decent. I love that there are always Japanese folks in here dining. That always tells me something....that the place is good and the locals know! I've never sat at the sushi bar but the table service is very attentive and fast. The food as I mentioned is delicious and well worth it. Get hooked on this place during the summer and do take-out during the winter. That's as good as it gets!",

Needed a table for 4 and was told they wouldn't be able to accommodate us because they were booked with reservations for the night. (I had called 15 mins before to make sure they were open that evening before we drove over and was not told we needed a reservation). Decided to just order food to go because we had 2 hungry kids with us that needed to have dinner. On the way out after our food was ready, a group of 5 showed up, said they had no reservations, and were seated immediately. Apparently, this restaurant discriminates against guests with children. So, beware that if you show up with kids, you might be denied seating. Very sad and upsetting.",

The counters were a bit too high to be very comfortable and I bumped elbows with a fellow diner.  We ordered the lunch bento box.  I had teriyaki salmon and shrimp tempura and the wife had the salmon and California roll, crunchy, both included rice, green salad, and miso soup. My wife ordered some iced tea, I drank water. Staff was very friendly and patient and the countertop was clean.  Portions were small but the food was tasty.  We spent almost $33 without the tip and were still a bit hungry.  Don't think we will return at these prices.  What we ate was pleasant, perhaps we might be used to eating too much!  We both have a normal body weight.",

    "text": "As the first restaurant I've ever visited in AZ, Hiro Sushi knocked it out of the park on the first swing. After a long, exhausting, and morally defeating week of 120-degree weather, I was in need for a real \"treat yo self\" evening. I strolled into Hiro elated to find an air-conditioned oasis with a lively sushi bar and (most important) cold sake.   I've dined solo at several points in my life; sometimes it's awkward, especially if you're given a table for two with a romantic view. Bellying up to the sushi bar took all of the awkwardness out of eating alone. With the friendly sushi chefs taking orders and providing a little bit of entertainment, I had a great time with my roll ($6), my udon ($13), and my unexpectedly huge bottle of Nigiri sake ($11).   Really friendly service and a full house of patrons (on a Thursday night in my case) made for fun, family-friendly vibes with great food. If I'm staying in the area again, I'll be sure to return!",

Not only do they deliver the food quickly after you order, it's all fresh! And by fresh I mean when my fried avocado roll was delivered to me, it was still piping hot and when I bit into it there was still a crispy crunch to it! Typically, whenever I eat a fried avocado roll at other sushi joints, the roll wouldn't be as hot so that meant the texture of the roll itself wouldn't be as crisp. The cucumber salad has the perfect taste of sour to it while still containing it crunchy texture, probably the best cucumber salad I've ever tried! Not only that, but the staff overall were wonderful and they truly know how to treat their customers well! The secret behind a successful business is through an amazing team that know a thing or two about quality customer service, and this place has got it!",

Then scallop, toro, eel, fatty tuna, tamago, hamachi, yello tail and uni came out. Lot of them, right?.  The rice under the sushi were not so tasty and did not blend well with the sushi. The sushi piece were too thin cut. It was fresh at least. We were pretty disappointed by its overall taste. The mixed tempura were lacking its crispyness and the miso soup was not even hot.

And I don't mean to use the term wannabe in a derogatory manner. I just wanted to convey that if you like your fish fried they will be able to satisfy your needs. And this is not just tempura. They have fried versions of many non-fried originals.  The menu is quite elaborate and they always feature numerous specials. This evening after being \"stood up\" for dinner by my son, Omar, who is a mere 6 hours behind schedule driving from LA to Scottsdale, I decided I was going to do sashimi. So I headed straight for Hiro, a place I have always been pleased with.  This evening was no different. I ordered a combination of mackerel, tuna and clam. Mon Dieu! It was heaven. What really accentuated the experience was that, if available, I always ask for freshly grated wasabi. Today I had the pickled wasabi and it was superb.  So I am a happy camper although I would have much preferred to have Omar eating alongside me.",

First the negatives, or actually just negative, since I can think of only one thing - the place is tiny, so the wait could be quite long if it's a busy night (we went on Thurs, and waited about 15 mins for a party of 3).  I ordered some of the sushi: blue fin tuna, unagi, yellowtail, and scallop - they were all fresh and yummy!  In addition, we had the agedashi tofu, and the shishito peppers - both were done perfectly!  In addition to the sushi and appetizers, I ordered a combo chicken teriyaki and pork ginger...yes, I was hungry - both entrees were delicious too!

As the captain server of one of the most popular sushi restaurants in old town, it's easy for me to see that the quality here does not lack in any category.    The service is impeccable and the smiling faces behind the sushi bar make for an amazing dining experience.  This is a \"hope in the wall\" type place that is an absolute diamond in the rough, great work guys, keep it up! Masa-san sure knows his stuff!",

    "text": "I went to dinner with 2 co-workers last night, a Monday night.  We walked in and found out it was our lucky night.  Without a reservation we weren't able to get a table, but there were 3 seats in a row immediately available at the sushi bar.  This place is small, so definitely plan ahead and make reservations.  The service was friendly and prompt. We started with edamame, seaweed salad and a house salad.  Our group of 3 ordered a variety of sushi rolls, nigiri and sashimi.    I tend to stick with rolls primarily, but couldn't resist the tuna (maguro) nigiri my boss ordered.  The fish is so fresh here, I had to try a piece.  He also had the Negi Toro roll (fatty tuna/tuna belly with scallions) which I tried.  It wasn't my personal favorite, but I'm glad I tried it here at Hiro to try the best.  I chose 2 rolls for myself. First, a shrimp tempura roll.  Pretty reliable and not very creative, but I always get it.  This one was a little bland (probably made worse by my no-cucumber request) but they happliy provided a little side of eel sauce when I requested it.  My second roll was the Spicy Ribbon Roll.  I LOVED it.  I will go back for this roll.  The spicy tuna had a great flavor and was a perfect match for the cool, creamy avocado striped on top.  This was by far the highest quality sushi I have had in Phoenix/Scottsdale, and probably anywhere else in the country.  The price was fair and as I expected.  Rolls range from $6.95 to $13.95.  No real specials like happy hour, but I was coming here for an exceptional dinner, not a discounted price and/or experience.",

The servers and the sushi chefs were all really friendly. The rolls started coming shortly after we ordered. The fish was extremely fresh, we could definitely taste the difference!  We started off with the Philly roll, which we get at every sushi place we go to. Then we got the rainbow roll (my favorite, the fish was so good!), the spicy tuna roll and the Vegas roll. When the check came, we realized that they had forgotten to give us our spicy salmon roll. We brought it up to the servers and the chef apologized and made us one, no questions asked. And again it tasted awesome! 5 stars without a doubt.",

I've been here for both within a two week span and have had a good experience with both but I felt service was a bit quicker even if getting a table might be hard to accomplish.  The atmosphere is more calm even when busy, the food and wait service can be slow due to the high volume of people but the place was packed both times I came so I expected things like that. The food? In comparison with the other 3 places I've been to for sushi here in phoenix it was immaculate. It reminded me enough of Cali for the quality of fish I came back again the next day because I knew I would be leaving soon there after.  The flavor profiles for the food were good, the tempura whether as a side dish or within the rolls was crisp, the salmon was excellent, the quantity to quality ratio was good, aside from having to wait for a check each time for a considerable amount I was quite happy with the results.  So far I've had the negi toro, spicy ribbon, and I believe it was the phoenix or whatever the mixed fish roll was that had multiple types of fish in it that was deep fried. There was also one other roll but the name of it escapes me at this time. The negi toro and spicy ribbon were good, the phoenix not exactly my cup of tea.  All in all, in comparison with the other places I've been here, this place is a jewel. I'll gladly wait to get what I want out of food. If you're in a crunch for time, you shouldn't be going to places you know will be stacked with people anyway. That's just idiotic.",

For those that aren't sure what that means, it is a phrase that means \"I'll leave it to you\".  In other words, I left it up to the chef and put my dinner in his hands.  He did not let me down.  He started me off with ankimo, tempura battered & deep fried squid, and grilled shishito peppers.  The ankimo was delicious, the squid was crispy and hot, and the shishito peppers were a great counter-balance to the richness of the other two dishes.  Next was a platter of sashimi followed by a dish of various nigiri sushi.  All the fish tested fresh and presentation was good.  By this point I was stuffed and couldn't eat another course.  Out came my check and a deep fried shrimp head for \"dessert\" as my waiter called it.  It was crispy, hot, flavorful and was a nice finishing touch to the very good meal that I just had.  Overall, I was highly satisfied with my meal and will certainly go back.  A lot of places really push those bastardized garbage sushi rolls filled with cream cheese, drenched in sauce, and deep fried to high heaven.  Thank goodness I didn't see a whole lot of that being served here.",

As someone from California with access to exceptional sushi any time any place, I can confidently say that Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale AZ is the clear and indisputable best.  The chefs are astoundingly well trained -- Hiro himself trained in Japan for over 25 years. I consider it a kindness that he brought such an art to the desert. Not a single cut is sloppy.  The hard-to-find items can all be found here.  The Hiro website advertises that they do not have \"trendy\" sushi. While this is True, Hiro and his team do embrace the local culture and incorporate it into their menu through fun local-inspired items like a Diamonback Roll.  Hiro brought culture to Arizona and brought Arizona culture to sushi.  The sushi is not the only amazing dish featured on their menu. All of the soups and entrees are also delicious and authentic.",

We always get an order of Uni and Toro whenever we get sushi nowadays, so its become sort of our starting indicator as to how the restaurant ranks to others. I'm so sad to say that I was disappointed with both the Uni and Toro-- both cut into thin slices on their relatively large beds of rice. The Chirashi was slightly better although I must warn you that its not much fish. I loved the thick slices of tuna and salmon, but was personally not a fan of the other items (squid, octopus, fish eggs). Overall, solid quality but left thinking, \"That's it?\"  Both the Spicy Ribbon Roll and the Udon noodles were superb. I'm a huge fan of salmon and my boyfriend loves spicy tuna, so the Spicy Ribbon Roll was absolutely perfect for us. The Udon noodles' soup was flavorful and the exact type of bowl you'd crave on a cold, rainy day.",

    "text": "Hiro Sushi is a traditional sushi bar/restaurant in Scottsdale.  It's a popular place where you can get a True Japanese experience.  My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)  Atmosphere - You'll find a long, traditional sushi bar along with several tables & chairs.  Now, it's not a large restaurant, so you can expect it to be full of patrons.  It can be a bit cramped in certain areas.  You're best off in a party of 4 or at the sushi bar when it's crowded.   1/2 Star.  Service - I like sushi restaurants where the server speaks Japanese.  It always makes me feel like getting authentic sushi.  Hiro Sushi passes this test.  Service was a bit slower when it got busy, but we were able to get all our orders in, order more, etc.  Great stuff here.  1 Star.  Food - We ordered the Chirashi special, which provided us with a large assortment of sashimi.  Honestly, from the ratings we thought we would be blown away, but it was good.  Also ordered some Udon noodles which provided a nice broth.  We continued with several other rolls - again solid but nothing memorable.  The entire meal is good not great, which isn't a bad thing.  1 Star.  Will I Return? - Only if I'm craving sushi in Scottsdale.  We made it here due to the high ratings, but honestly I didn't find anything so outstanding that I haven't had at many other Sushi restaurants.  There's no doubt Hiro has a loyal following, but I would only come back if sushi was the only type of cuisine I was craving.   1/2 Star.  My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts): 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.   Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",

They have a larger selection of sushi. This issue was so fresh!  They  truly are an authentic sushi place. You know this when the chefs are Japanese!!  :)   The service was excellent! It took awhile to get our order but it was because it was packed!  So be patient.   Yelp doesn't allow you to give half points. Otherwise I would give a 4.5 rating only because it's nearly impossible to get through to them on the phone. I tried calling 7 times for 10 minutes and just kept getting a busy signal.",

Even though it was in the middle of the week, the place was packed and people waiting.   I was a bit leery of going there because I assumed (wrongly!) that it would have a lot of the Americanized sushi with all the surprise elements mixed in the makisushi, which I dislike.   If I am going to have nigiri sushi, I want a bite size piece of rice with whatever fish or product I pick put on top.  I ordered the sushi dinner and my daughter ordered sushi ala carte from the sushi menu.   The fish was fresh, definitely.   I can't say any more than that.   I LOVED it!

    "text": "I hate to write bad reviews, but today's experience definitely left my party hungry and angry after having a lunch date at Hiro's.  First of all, the few items we tried were pretty good. That is where my original 4 stars went. Try the Crispy Shrimp (fried shrimp wrapped in potatoes), it is delicious and creative. Sashimi and nigiri were all great quality, so I definitely agree with all the positive reviews on the food here. Japanese Snapper sashimi was excellent too!  The reason I have taken away the 2 stars is the absolutely terrible service we received from the sushi chef that was servicing us (whom I am pretty sure was the head sushi chef and likely Hiro's son). We sat at the sushi bar, pretty much facing the chef, but we were never acknowledged, nor greeted. When the plates of items were handed to us, it was not stated what they were, if the chef decided to tell us, it was handed to us like we were a bother. He was EXTREMELY friendly and chatty with the people sitting on the left and right of us.   Not sure why we were singled out to be treated like a bother by the sushi chef. We know the waitress was overworked with the amount of guests today, but the sushi chef would spend 30 minutes chatting up the couple next to us, make special items for them to try, but when he finally made the few items for us, he would hand the plate to us one handed and look away, like no eye contact and not a hint of smile on his face! How rude!   When we asked for fresh grated wasabi, he gave us a giant pile of what appears to me to be a mixture of freshly grated horseradish mixed with wasabi powder. I am sorry, we have eaten at many sushi restaurants, and have had fresh grated wasabi before. That big pile of green stuff sir, was not freshly grated wasabi. If that was, we would have been happy to pay for it. But since it was simply piled on a little plate like it costs nothing, I am pretty sure my assumption was correct. Freshly grated horseradish does not equal freshly grated wasabi. It was like the sushi chef thinks that we have never had real sushi before.   We understand the turnaround of items we ordered were slow to show up due to the non-stop stream of customers coming in. However, we definitely did not feel welcome by the sushi chef at the sushi bar. We went there prepared to drop a few hundred dollars for excellent sushi, but was left with a bad taste in our mouth.  I am sorry, we will never return again, especially if we were such a bother to be served by the one sushi chef there. The great food was ruined by the bad service experience, bad mood does not make good food...",

The chicken  is totally overcooked and rubbery, inedible. It's very obvious that the chicken is precooked then added to the dish while cooking. That is NOT how oyakodon is supposed to be cooked.  How do I know, you ask?  I worked in a real Japanese restaurant and I know how the dish is properly prepared. I have also been to Japan numerous times. Un acceptable rubber chicken makes the dish not enjoyable.  Meat is to be cooked in the broth.",

On my first night in Phoenix, I tried the fancy schmancy Roka Akor...let me tell ya, this place trumps Roka Akor. The menu here is simple and very typical of a Japanese sushi restaurant but you can tell that they put so much care and precision into making all of their dishes.   Ordered about 4 rolls between my friend and me (yes, 4 rolls for 2 people!) and we demolished everything. We were VERY full afterwards but were VERY satisfied. The quality of the raw fish is really up there and even the sushi rice is quality sushi rice. I hate overly sauced rolls but Hiro Sushi does a good job of keeping the balance between all the components of making a great sushi roll. Thanks for a great lunch, Hiro!",

Everything from start to finish was fantastic. We ordered the seaweed salad which was labeled on the menu as \"best seaweed salad in Arizona\"... I'd have to agree. We then proceeded to order the real crab meat california roll, caterpillar, dragon, and crazy roll. All were delicious.

In addition to the food, the staff are great. Masa, Take, and Leo (just to name a few) are great chefs who are also very personable and funny.

Lighting is on the darker side, but not too dark.  To begin, I recommend Ama Ebi with Heads (and yes, the entire thing is eatable). As an entree, I recommend the Beef Teriyaki. All dinner items include miso soup, steamed rice, and salad.  Sashimi/Sushi items range from about $6 to $14. Entrees range from about $16 to $26.  I must add that the portions are somewhat small for its price -- particuarly the Ama Ebi (they are very small at this restaurant). Also, the same can be said for the main items on the dinner items (ex. small amounts of beef teriyaki, chicken, etc.); and they seem to get smaller with each subsequent visit (just an observation).  Nonetheless, Hiro Sushi is certainly above average.",

    "text": "Being from California, the sushi was alright. Nothing that blew me out of the waters. But what I did appreciate was the service and how the restaurant was owned by Japanese people (instead of the Korean-owned sushi places that is everywhere from East Coast to West Coast). Service itself was excellent. Our hostess was very attentive to adjust to even the smallest changes to our party's requests. Sushi, on the other hand, was served at a varying rate which I found a bit annoying because some people got their food really quick while others had to eat after the rest of our group had finished eating. The quality was good but I have found \"good\" elsewhere also. I'll probably give it another try after I explore some other restaurants.",

Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why.

I waited about half hour and the whole ordered came in one plate . First of all, I am used to sushi serve by the chef one at time for omekaze . The other things were missing all the basics , no ginger or wasabi and some of the garnishes for certain pieces that the head chef ( I think was Mr. Hiro himself ) had to put on the pieces . It was quite disappointing for pricey sushi set menu at $110 . The quality was little better than average . I noticed most the clientele at Hiro ordered rolls and not nigiri. So, if you are looking for sushi , look at other as Shinbay",

Way before Yelp, I reviewed Hiro on some other website, and I think what I wrote ended up on an award displayed on the restaurant's wall for being \"best sushi\" in Phoenix.  Anyway - About the food...  First and foremost, the fish is flown in DAILY.  Not once a week, not every other day, DAILY.  Ask what is fresh that day, and you are sure to get the freshest fish in town, even on a Sunday!  I love sashimi - no rice, no roll, just raw fish - and Hiro's is the tops.  While they haven't had it in a while, the Striped Jack is my all-time favorite, but give me any sweet, buttery, or somewhat firm fish from Hiro, and I am in heaven.  BTW, don't let the strip-mall location scare you away.  What it does say about this oh-so-awesome sushi bar  is that it is a place to get damned good sushi, not to be seen.  If you want the typical Scottsdale bar scene quasi-japanese restaurants better known for happy hour specials than fish, don't go to Hiro.  If you want the best sushi in the Southwest, take a drive to Hiro.",

    "text": "Since I've relocated from Los Angeles, finding good sushi places has been a task. I took it upon my fellow yelpers to find this place and I was happy that I did. I was planning on going to Ra or Stingray, though I knew it would be mediocre, before finding this place on Yelp.  So we get there day after Christmas with no reservation at around 6:20pm. Why would we need one it shouldn't be that busy, right?  Wow we were wrong. The wait was going to be 50-1 hr for 2 and it was only for the sushi bar. So we decided to wait. (I needed my sushi fix) There was no place to really wait except for outside. There was no bar, the restaurant was small so we couldn't wait inside, and placed in a strip mall with nothing much around.  We walked to a small Mexican cafe located in the same area for some drinks while we waited. (back in 40 mins since there was no other methods of letting us know that our table was ready)  Finally we get seated at the sushi bar. We ordered several pieces of nigiri (toro, sweet raw shrimp with fried shrimp head, scallop, uni, hokkigai) and one maki of spicy yellow tail. That was delicious. Maybe it was because I haven't had sushi in such a long time but everything that I had was pretty tasty. The only thing that I could done without was the salmon collar. It was greasy and had a little gelatinous taste for me on some parts but my husband enjoyed it so that's all that matters.  The severs were great and attentive. Place was cozy and had a warm feel to it and prices weren't too bad. 4 stars for the wait and the so so salmon collar.   I will be back most definitely and maybe it will be 5 stars.",

    "text": "It's OK but certainly not great.  We stopped by on a Saturday night around 8.  It was busy and we sat at the sushi bar.  We ordered a couple of rolls and a half dozen nigiri sushi and everything was alright but nothing beyond that.  The atmosphere is old-school neighborhood Japanese like you used to find in LA's Japanese neighborhoods 20 years ago.  Unpretentious and slightly divey.  Service was friendly and efficient from the waitresses.  The sushi chef never made eye contact or spoke to us even though we were sitting right in front of his workspace for 45 minutes.  Our platter had perhaps 3 pieces of ginger so I asked the sushi chef for more ginger.  I got maybe another tablespoon of ginger - without a word.  Annoying. The sushi was decently made but nothing terribly special.  The rice was a bit loose/wet, the fish quality was very average, with the exception of the hamachi, which was quite good. The fish portions were also a bit small. When we were there,  they were out of uni.   I would stop by if I was in the neighborhood and in the mood for sushi but I wouldn't drive across town for it.  Our bill was $60.00 for two with tip for a moderate amount of sushi, a sake and a beer.  As several other Yelpers have observed, the plethora of 5 star reviews for this joint are baffling to me.  My response would have to be \"huh?\"  I've been eating sushi for 30 years, been to Japan many times and I know what great sushi is and this isn't even close.  The sushi chef seemed to be mainly making the very non-Japanese rolls (cream cheese, etc.) that are so popular throughout the Valley.  If this is \"the best sushi in the Valley\" then people in the valley have set the bar a bit too low or else they've never had really good sushi.",

    "text": "This is by far my (and the hubby's) favorite Japanese place in the Valley. The sushi rolls are typical of what you would find in just about every other \"sushi joint\" but what sets Hiro apart in my opinion are the non-sushi menu items. It is reminiscent of my experiences in Japan - Okinawa Soba, Nabeyaki Udon and mushroom tea pot soup to name a few. And if you consider yourself an adventurous eater and really do want sushi/sashimi ask for \"omakase\" and the chef will whip up some off-the-menu items sure to make you smile. Oh and the staff is worth getting to know if you have some time to chat a while. (Hint: they have lives outside of the restaurant. Go figure!)",

    "text": "I was running out of time to spend in Phoenix but I just couldn't possibly pass the opportunity to try Hiro Sushi, especially after reading these amazing reviews from you fellow yelpers.  I called in and placed a take-out order as I was driving towards the restaurant.  You gotta do what you gotta do for food you can't get in your city.  ;)  While waiting for my food around 6pm on a Friday evening on their little bench by the entrance, groups after groups and couples after couples made their ways into the restaurant.  Most of them have reservations, which definitely suggested me to be sure to make a reservation for my future visit.  As much of Hiro as I saw, there were numerous pictures of famous people with the same Japanese man.  (Perhaps Hiro, the restaurant owner?)  The restaurant persuaded a cozy feeling.  The traditional noren by the entrance and the actual Japanese chefs earned bonus points in my book.  As the waiter handed me my food, and my check, I was sad I had to leave Hiro.  Without even trying their food, I knew I wanted to come back for the full experience, the whole SHEBANG!  I was tempted the whole entire drive to unpack that brown bag.  As soon as I got home, I was pleased to find how nice everything was packaged up.  Everything was there as if I was served in a restaurant; the thinly sliced ginger, wasabi, packaged soy sauce, sauce for my hiro roll, my foam container for my rolls was even decorated?.  I appreciated the fact that they were thoughtful enough to separate the sauce for my long drive.  If I remember it correctly, hiro roll is supposed to be served in their special sauce, which means my roll would be soaky when I get home.  Both rolls tasted delicious even though they were made an hour ago.  I only wished I ordered more food.  :P  I had no complaint as far as food concerns.  Hiro by far serves the best sushi I have had in Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I did think the bill was a bit pricey but after tasted their food, it was no longer a concern.  I am giving Hiro a four-star rating because it didn't quite match the best I had in Asia.",

It's a tiny restaurant with its Sushi bar on one side, and around a dozen tables on the other. You won't find the loud music and the Old Town crowd at this place. Instead, you'll find some of the best rolls in Arizona.   We had orders of Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, and asked them to make a Salmon and Avocado Roll (a great call by my girlfriend), and a small bottle of Saki. Hiro has a pretty good selection of Saki, not just the cheapest stuff to heat up for a Bomber. All three rolls may be simple, but with full confidence I can say they were better than all of the more popular Sushi bars.   The staff is also very friendly. As we got up to leave we got a \"goodbye\" and \"Thank you\" from the server, all the chefs at the Sushi bar, and the hostess. As much as I enjoy the \"scenery\" at the flashy Scottsdale Sushi bars. I'm not going complain that I got to enjoy Sushi without them. If you're looking for great rolls, head to Hiro.",

    "text": "I'll preface this review in saying that I tend to like a mix of both authentic Japanese and a little bit of Americanized cuisine as well - but when it comes to the authentic end, I'm very picky.  I went here a little over a week ago with my uncle and aunt who are both from Japan (born and raised) and they were very impressed as well by the quality of the food and service.  We ordered a couple of apps, sushi, and entrees which was more than enough food for the three of us.  The fish was very fresh, tempura was light and crispy and everything was well balanced and prepared properly.  I love their hand rolls and the cuts of fish are generous and absolutely delectable! I swear... my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  If you're looking for a place with great ambiance or amazing decor, you'll have to move along.  Hiro is modest in design, but what it lacks there it makes up for in quality and integrity of the food and service.  This place for sure has the best sushi I've had thus far here in Arizona!  Finding the place was a little on the difficult side since we didn't know exactly where it was and it's located in a strip mall (we drove past it at first).  But it was definitely worth the trip out and I can't wait to come back.  Don't be surprised at their non-extensive menu, but they are accommodating if you're looking to have something specific.  What Hiro does, Hiro does well and are very knowledgeable.  Everything I have tried on their menu is delicious and a wonderful treat! Yumminess for sure!",

I arrived at 5pm to a line already at the front door, but we were able to sit at the bar no problem. We were not acknowledged by our chef. In fact he ignored us the entire time. I am not sure when he prepared my rolls as I did not see him do it. He handed me a plate with very small rolls the kind you see at Chinese buffets. My first thought was wow the quality here has changed in the past year until another couple sat next to me and were acknowledged right away. This couple also ordered two of the same rolls that I too ordered and there's were substantially larger. Now I know from being a sushi fan for a number of years that if you get in good with your chef they will sometimes hook you up with larger portions, free samples, etc. but they were not chums of his. In a nut shell, I felt slighted going to Hiro Sushi today. The food remains good and of substantial quality but I will not return. I will take my money to Shimogamo in Chandler where both the food and customer service rocks!",

    "text": "We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.  I find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade.",

    "text": "AMAZING AMAZING SUSHI!  The only downside (and clearly not enough to deter a 5 Star Review) was how small this place is and how few tables they have. They need to expand now!!! My husband and I went on a Saturday night and the wait was 30 minutes but oh so worth it! We sat at the bar and watched the chef prepare our sushi. Dinner and a show ;). We may have also gotten lucky with our sushi chef because he definitely knew what he was doing. The fish was fresh and delicate. We thoroughly enjoyed every roll we consumed, and that's hardly ever the case when we have sushi out!   Love this place!",

Surprised to be presented with a very high bill at the end of the meal and Gratuity was added for 6 people. Definitely Scottsdale prices. Not somewhere I'd rush back to or recommend.",

The dining room was pretty busy but they had a few seats at the sushi counter. I stuck to a side of miso eggplant and some nigiri. The fish was fresh and super flavorful; the rice was perfectly vinegared too. I also had a negitoro hand roll to end the meal, which was handed to me directly by the sushi chef, as you'd expect. You won't find fancy over the top rolls and service here, but you will find authentic, high quality nigiri and sashimi.",

They are not some gigantic over-priced fancy place, but just a friendly little joint that serves good Japanese food. The staff and the chefs are friendly and make customers feel like VIPs. We love the cucumber salad. The acidity is so on point that it is actually sweet. Their fish are fresh, and their rolls, ESPECIALLY the D-Back Roll, are impressive. it has just the right amount of rice and are seasoned just the way it should be. We order the Hamachi Kama, and it was grilled just right. It must have been fresh as they didn't need to down it with salt before grilling, and with a little bit of soy sauce and it tasted perfect. We finished our dinner with deep-fried green tea ice-cream. Now, most places we've been to, we would have ordered a ball of ice-cream rolled in tempura crumbs. That's not the case here. they actually deep fried the ice-cream. Every bite comes with the warmth of the crispy pastry-skin and the coolness of the good green tea ice-cream. LOVED it.",

The shrimp especially is more meat-like and high quality. - Katsu-don: HUGE portion of rice! We had to take the leftovers home. Overall, the dish was very delicious and reminded me of the katsu-don I've tried in Japan. Would recommend for sure!",

Great service by friendly and knowledgeable servers. So fun watching the sushi chefs prepare our food. This place reminded me of the sushi places we've visited in Kyoto and Tokyo, took me back to great memories! Super fresh fish, not smelly and not fishy. We had the crazy roll, tuna sushi and bento box with gyoza and tempura. All were great. Tempura well done slightly greasy but yummy. Big servings. The spicy tuna in the Crazy Roll was amazing! They don't use mayo just fresh chopped tuna and spicy sauce. I appreciate that. The gyoza in the bento box was full of flavor, juicy meat and pan fried to perfect crispness! Definitely go here! The price is right, the food is on point and it will take you on a trip down memory lane in Japan!",

We were told about 25 minutes wait and were seated in about 20.  Hiro's is rather small and was very busy but we were never rushed out the door. Staff was quite attentive and everyone we encountered was friendly. My wife, who is pregnant had short rib pork soup and seemed to enjoy it greatly. My sister and law and her boyfriend ordered up salmon sashimi and a couple of rolls. I chose the chirashi dinner special.   Overall all the dishes were very good. The rolls looked good, but I couldn't comment on taste. My chirashi was a first for me and it was good, beautifully presented and tasty. I can't speak to pricing as I didn't see the final bill but it was definately good and I'd return when we are back in Scottsdale.",

My main complaint is we asked our waitress to bring us a bunch of sushi and sashimi that the chef recommended and asked to include some of the unusual specials. The waitress asked how much we wanted to spend and we asked how much money would require something special and she said $50 a person.  After waiting about 30 minutes we get a plate of very basic sashimi - although it did taste very good. Then we received 6 pieces of sushi, which were also tasty, but it didn't seem that we received $50 worth of food considering the costs of items on the menu.   Also - we asked for a specific roll on the side and asked for avocado twice and didn't receive it both times.   I'd definitely give this place another try and order items directly off the menu but I was a bit disappointed by the experience because it seemed we didn't get the amount of food we paid for and were still hungry at the end.  Otherwise, the service is great and this seems like a good local place.",

    "text": "For me personally, Hiro's is in that rare category of restaurants that is so good that (out of pure selfishness) I almost don't want to leave a review or tell people about it because I want it all to myself. However, after nearly a decade of patronage, anytime I'm asked about my favorite restaurant, where good sushi is, or where to find good fish in general... There is only one answer Hiro's Sushi. If the fact that even though they open for dinner at 5:00pm, My dad and I get there at 4:30 (so we can sit in front of Hiro at the sushi bar) and still have people already in line. Any regular will tell you that on Friday and Saturday nights they open at 5:00 and by 5:05 they're on a 45 minute to and hour wait. What more do you need to see? If that isn't proof you're in the right place for an incredible meal I don't know what is. What's nice about Hiro's (aside from the level of high quality ingredients, skill in preparation and sincere hospitality) is that whether you're getting your first California roll or your idea of desert is Uni or Quail egg and roe you will be taken care of. All you need to do is let them know what you like what you don't like and they will suggest a few things to lead you in the right direction. However, if you'd rather have the full experience and you don't mind spending a pretty penny... The best way to enjoy an evening at Hiro's is to sit at the far end of the sushi bar in front of Hiro and say \"Chef I'm in your hands tonight, if you would choose what I have I would be extremely grateful.\" It's truly the best way to experience this restaurant.",

It definitely did not seem like it could be a 5-star restaurant, but I am wrong.  First of all, the ambiance of the place is a lot nicer than the pics that are shown here on Yelp. They have a very long sushi bar with chefs chatting it up with you, and then there is also lots of dining areas. Light jazzy music is played softly and the lights are dim.  I ordered the crazy roll ($9), with spicy salmon, tempura shrimp, avocado, cucumbers wrapped in a pink soy. Their spicy sauce is so good and their tempura is very crunchy and tasty.  I also had the Volcano ($10), which had clams, enoki mushrooms, regular mushrooms, mayonnaise, baked. The dish was super creamy and meant to be shared. I kinda regret eating it all by myself since it must be super fatty, yet i enjoyed every bite of it.  All this was accompanied by a large glass of plum wine for only $6.  Fantastic!",

I have come here for a few years n have never been disappointed.

    "text": "Before I delve into my personal experience at Hiro, I will discuss the important factors of, what makes a good sushi restaurant, according to my criteria.   For credibility I've eaten sushi my entire life, everywhere from Cali to NYC to Tokyo . I believe I can distinguish between the different levels of superb sushi grade fish.   - Fish Quality     I ordered the dinner sashimi platter ($21), 2 orders of the spanish mackeral nigiri($11), 1 order of the giant clam nigiri ($11).               *The sashimi was average, and the tuna had a distinct \"fishy\" smell to it. The portions were of average size, and the layout was aesthetically pleasing. The Spanish Mackeral was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! I highly recommend it, albeit the cuts are small, the fish is delicious. The giant clam was overpriced based on its size and freshness.   - Rice Quality     This is pretty hard to mess up. The rice is perfectly balanced as it should be. The fish to rice ratio was good.   I went into this restaurant with high expectations, first from the high reviews on Yelp, and second upon entering the restaurant you are overwhelmed by an abundance of Japanese celebrity pictures plastered all throughout the entrance. They are all somehow affiliated with the restaurant/owner. The pictures suggest that these Japanese celebrities have eaten at this restaurant and give their thumb of approval.   3 stars because this restaurant, in regards to nigiri and sashimi, were just average. The problem with sushi reviews on Yelp is that you get a lot of yelpers reviewing based on rolls and sake bombs. It's sad but True that so many people will judge a restaurant based on how good their rolls are when the True judgment of a sushi restaurant should be in the quality of their nigiri.   I have given up on sushi in Phoenix. From now on I will get my sushi fix elsewhere.",

It's small and often feels cramped, the service is spotty (like they're nice but are not very attentive which is somewhat surprising considering how small it is) also its always noisy and the sushi selection isn't as good as it could be butttt it's virtually the only authentic Japanese restaurant in the area that's not terribly americanized. Also the rolls the do serve are good in the sense that the fish tastes good and fresh...I guess I just don't absolutely adore them though because they use this weird soy paper instead of seaweed, they don't offer many dishes with eel which is my favorite,  and they I just wish they utilized more ingredients and sauces to mix it up a bit. So overall not the best place ever but it's authentic, the fish is good quality, and the chefs are always nice so if you want sushi and it has to be in Scottsdale this is a good place to go.",

One roll and two hand rolls never made it to the table. We kept checking with the server and she didn't seem to have concern or urgency. We then asked to remove those so he could go grab lunch somewhere else. Still waiting on a check. Server came back ten mins later and asked if we wanted anything more! No, we needed the check when you saw one person at the table didn't get to eat. No discount on the bill for lack of service and the apology was hmmmm. 3 other customers were served sushi plates during this time.

I remember my first visit with my friend, a sushi maniac so many years ago. I hardly understood the food at all. We ate crisp shrimp heads. I hardly believed this was food.  Anyway I have grown to love sushi and sitting at the bar. It's more than just a food, sushi is an art form enjoyed for its taste as well as presentation.

This is a traditional japanese sushi restaurant where quality is most important vs the mediocre sushi restaurants that focus on the atmosphere first.   The fish is very fresh and the chefs prepare it very well.  I got 4 orders of nigiri (2 per order) , eel cucumber roll, mushroom teppan soup, seaweed salad.  My favorite was the salmon nigiri. The chefs were very nice too and it was fun sitting at the sushi bar.  I will definetly be back!",

Located in a little strip mall, Hiro Sushi is not flashy, fancy, or trendy...but that's part of why its so great.  It's a tiny restaurant and its always packed, so you will probably have a little bit of a wait if you come during peak hours.  Most of the people that come here are all dedicated Hiro regulars it seems.  Once you try it, it WILL become your go-to sushi joint.  I think its always best to sit at the sushi bar so you can interact with the chefs.  Leo is the man and who I usually wait for, but they are all great guys and all very talented!  As I've said in some of my other sushi restaurant reviews, I'm a stickler for quality and freshness with my sushi.  Hiro has it nailed down here.  If its not fresh, they won't serve it.  I don't know if I can count how many things I've tried here but not a single thing stands out to me that I have ever disliked.  All of the fish melts in your mouth and all the pieces are properly sized and cut.  My recommendation is to just go and have them make you whatever is best.  They always have a sizeable amount of fish specials that they get in, you can never go wrong with one of those.  One highlight is the spanish mackrel....if they have it, order it.  It is prepared fresh, right in front of you...and it is out of this world.",

Both visits I've ordered this and both times it has been fresh and tastes like the sweet ocean!  Sushi chefs are friendly and attentive. Waitresses are hit or miss. My first visit the waitress refilled my green tea constantly. This time I had to turn around and ask for it to be refilled. Oh well. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in the area!",

    "text": "I'm from S. Cali where the Sushi options are plentiful. Moving to AZ I've been in desperate need of finding a local sushi spot that would be at least semi-comparable to the quality we get back in LA and at reasonable price-points. Taking in to consideration that the fish might be fresher and not previously frozen because LA has its harbors, I went to Hiro's with lower expectations so I wouldn't be disappointed. Overall, the ambiance and the sushi quality is pretty good for being in AZ. However, the prices are a bit high as to be expected being that it is located in Scottsdale and that the rent and getting quality fish so far inland from the coast would raise cost. The portions could be larger to justify the higher prices. Moreover, I don't understand WHY the bento boxes (i.e. Teriyaki Chicken & Mixed Tempura) is priced so high! For that reason, I probably won't be returning here, especially if I want non-fish options. That kind of stuff shouldn't be priced so high because it's produced locally. I would understand if it were Kobe beef or something.. but chicken? And to add insult to injury, the chicken that I received that night was a bit on the dry side. Not sure if it was an isolated incident but for the high price I expect quality or even naturally raised organic style chicken...now we're talking! Anyway, now I feel cheated in that respect. Sorry Hiro, on to the next spot!",

I have been twice (once on a weekend and once during the week) and both times the sushi I had was the freshest I've found in the Scottsdale/Phx area in the 27yrs I've lived here. Service was a bit slow both times I was there, but that is easily overlooked as the sushi was so good and the fish was so fresh. I will definitely be back!",

The food is fresh and portions are generous. We go at least once a week and never grow tired of the food. You can also order large bottles of Sake which they will keep for you for your next time in. Hiro, Leo, Masa, EJ, Take, Kazu and Steve are fantastic chefs.",

    "text": "Decided to try Hiro Sushi because of the  reviews as it is very difficult to find a good sushi restaurant in the valley.  With my husband being half Japanese, lived in Japan & just having visited Tokyo last May for 2 weeks - it takes a lot to win over our palates.    First, this not your typical modern sushi restaurant which translates to social meeting place/lounge for people that want mega rolls with different condiments splattered all over them. They have some, but  if that is what you think sushi is - head to Sapporo or RA.  Second, nothing against non-Japanese sushi chefs as they can be quite talented - but something about having Japanese sushi chefs creating your food that brings some authenticity to the whole experience.  Third, the fish was fresh and was served in good portions.  Its not about bigger is better - quality is what you pay for when it comes to sashimi or nigiri.  Looked over the entree menu - typical mix of tempura, teriyaki & katsu dishes - nothing real special.  Will definitely go back.",

    "text": "My family and I have been regular patrons of this restaurant since before yelp even existed!! The owner, Hiro-san, is the friendliest man ever :)  When I was a little girl he would used to carve me flowers and animals out of carrots in his spare time to keep a bored kid in an adult's dinner party happy and occupied. Now that the restaurant's so successful he has barely any time to make it in and out of the kitchen! But he never fails gives us a huge grin and welcoming wave whenever he sees us.  The staff here is so friendly that when I walk in the doors I always feel at ease.  It's the same feeling as returning home to food and an experience that I KNOW is going to be amazing and satisfying.  Now on to the food...my family and I come to this restaurant AT LEAST once every month.  Since this place is a must-go whenever we have guests visiting, and we've had numerous guests visit us this past month, we have been to HIro's once every week!  Even with all the frequent dining at this restaurant for so many years, we're never tired of it because it is JUST THAT GOOD.  The food is authentic (as I already knew but again confirmed by my visiting friends from Japan) and the quality very fresh.  The following is a list of our favorites:  - miso soup- no explanation necessary :) - spicy tuna roll - catepillar roll- ADORABLE looking and everyone whose had it swears it's delicious.  I believe them but I don't eat eel so I've never tried it. - toro- excellent quality!! - hiyayakko- cold tofu with bonito flakes paired with scallions and ginger.  Pour some soy sauce over it and you have a light, healthy, but tasty appetizer. - nasumiso- miso glazed eggplants. You can't go wrong with this one, trust me. - hamachi kama- yellowtail collar.  The meat is so tender and the sauce they have with it totally makes the dish.  Be sure to squeeze some lemon on it as well! - dynamite- a seafood mix baked in a special sauce.  This is a dish you won't see elsewhere.  It's very rich but also very unique. - halibut carpaccio- raw sliced halibut with sliced scallions and tomatoes.  They pour hot oil over it to half-cook it.  Kind of Italian-Japanese fusion, and very creative! - zaru soba- authentic Japanese soba noodles. Refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. - green tea ice cream- if you're feeling up to desert, definitely give this a try.  Green tea is my personal favorite and it's actually hard to find good quality ice cream in that flavor!  Their GT ice cream is definitely NOT the cheap gross ones I've unfortunately purchased once at a supermarket...  That should be enough to get you started! There are so many more great dishes I could list but these are the ones we always come back to :)  Branch out and give everything a try! This would be the place to try new things because you can be at ease knowing that anything you order will be of a certain caliber. We tried the sesame roll for the first time yesterday and it was surprising, creative, and delicious.  :)  Hopefully my super long, and way overdue review of this restaurant will convince you to go try it out, or even just try some new dishes!  Now go make your reservation...I promise you won't be disappointed!!",

    "text": "As you approach this building from the outside, you don't really expect alot, or at least I didn't. It's in a strip plaza (across the street from the Fry's on 90th), surrounded by shops catering toward spyware and vitamins. Odd, huh? In any case, you walk in and immediately notice how small the place is. Some may call it quaint - perhaps that's a nicer way of saying \"i could walk the length of the restaurant if I took 50 giant steps.\"   Sushi bar is where to go. The chefs are polite and offer suggestions. Don't expect to be entertained, but do expect to receive your order in a timely fashion.   You get a clean towel here, too. And prompt beverage service. 3.50 for a Sapporo - you can't go wrong.   So, is there anything extraordinary about this place? Not really, but perhaps that's why it works. Without the loud music and flashy scene of Scottsdale, you instead find succulent sashima in generous portions, along with a menu that makes you \"hmmm\" and \"uhmmm\" a bit longer than usual.   Miso soup is medicore (i've had better) and the edamame is refreshing without a thunderstorm of salt - thankfully!  Jazz Roll. Crazy Roll. Shrimp Tempura Roll. How do you decide? When it doubt, just try it all. Or get the Caterpillar Roll - it's made different from other places. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something oddly wonderful about mixing textures - from the softness of the rice and avacado to the crunchyness of the inside. Oh, and eel is divine. So is the extra bonus of shrimp ontop.   I wouldn't consider this my fave place, and it's definitely not in my neighborhood... but if you live, work or just happen to be in the area, definitely stop into Hiro. You shouldn't leave disappointed, unless you're expecting something other than great food, friendly staff and, lo and behold, a restaurant where you actually hear Japanese spoken by the staff. Now that's worth a bonus star!",

Little disappointed w/their Spicy tuna - I didn't feel any degree of warmth on those.  In general, I felt that their seafood wasn't the freshest, but I realize that this is challenging as we're in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. Prices were a tad high also.  Best I had was their Seaweed Salad - so yummy! Spices were perfect!  Their ambience was rather sub-par, IMO. You walk in and it's a tiny little waiting room w/chairs that scream that they're from 1988. Additionally, they had a wall of framed photos of past patrons w/their autograph? Hmm - looked very dated and sorta junky/cluttered. Some photos were faded - this makes me scared to eat their food...

    "text": "This week, our sushi quest brought us to Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  After last week's debacle, we wanted something that seemed like a more sure bet.  We started with the miso soup, and then ordered pretty much everything that seemed new and/or tasty.  The first dish that was served was our sashimi, which included uni (not the best I've had, but I'm spoiled after having had live sea urchin), toro (this was delicious), and Spanish mackerel (with deep fried bones!).  I am a mackerel fan, and the bones were even better.  I thought about asking if they had any extra Spanish mackerel bones lying around.  Next, we had the ankimo, which was pretty good.  I've had better ankimo, but it was far superior to the ankimo we had at Hana Japanese Eatery over a month ago.  After the ankimo, they brought the dynamite appetizer.  This was a baked scallop, mushroom, and cream dish that was pretty delicious, and a definite hit at our table (though it was inferior to the dynamite I had over a week earlier, which had geoduck in addition to scallops).  We then had the sushi: sea snail, edge of halibut, escolar, and jellyfish.  The halibut was garnished with too much wasabi for my taste, the sea snail was lightly flavored and crunchy, and the escolar was amazing.  (One of my friends pointed out this morning that escolar can cause diarrhea that is orange and oily, and I said, \"So, basically like my diarrhea this morning.\"  I contend that it was worth it.)  The jellyfish was a first for me; it was crunchy with a bit of a spicy flavor (not sure if they seasoned it, or if this is naturally the way jellyfish tastes).  At this point, we decided that we wanted a little more, so we ordered grilled shishitou peppers and salmon roe.  The salmon roe was not the best I have had, but the peppers were pretty tasty (not as good as the ones they have at Roka Akor, however).  Out of curiosity, I asked the waitress if they had any kama, which I did not see on the menu.  She said they had hamachi and salmon kama, which was only $8, so we sprung for the hamachi.  It was tasty and tender, but not as fall-off-the-bone tender or mouth-wateringly delicious as the hamachi kama we had at Sushi on Shea.  Finally, we had the tempura ice cream, which was the best tempura ice cream I have found in Phoenix.  Overall, Hiro seems like a very good sushi bar.  The food is fresh, they have some good special items, and it is actually very reasonably priced.  Unfortunately, it will be hard to go back here with Sushi on Shea being only a few miles down the road.",

What I ordered: - Grilled Mackerel Appetizer (cooked): YUM. If you are like me and love fishy/salty foods, this will hit the spot.  - Fresh Salmon Nigiri (raw): I always order this at sushi restaurants and base the freshness of the salmon on whether I will come back or not. Kinda been disappointed with other restaurants but Hiro Sushi's was excellent.  - Spicy Salmon Roll (raw): Good as usual. - Escolar Nigiri (white tuna- raw): Melts in your mouth good. They put a little bit of pico on top which I am not used to but it works.   For those of you who don't like seafood and are forced to accompany your friends or significant other to sushi, my boyfriend loves the vegetable roll. They actually put an assortment of veggies in this roll, not just cucumbers and carrots.   Other than that, service is helpful and friendly. Prices are a bit high, but if you are looking for quality fish, this place is worth it.",

    "text": "Let me say this, I usually hate sushi in Arizona. I love it in general but most places are down right disgusting, this place however is a right step in the direction, its what sushi should be. Unlike Ra and stingray, it's very intimate, the servers are knowledgable, the sushi chefs are experienced and by that I mean they have some age to them. I can't imagine an 18 year old making sushi really knows much about each fish in the trendy places. Loved the tuna belly sashimi and sedona roll!",

    "text": "I moved from Los Gatos, CA to Scottsdale in July 2011 and when I interviewed for the job I knew I had to find at least one decent sushi restaurant before I could accept the offer...maybe a slight exaggeration, but it was top on my list!  I found Hiro Sushi on Yelp and made a late night run for dinner.  The restaurant is cozy and tucked into a strip mall, so I wasn't sure what I was going to get.  When I went inside, there was a line, which I took as a good sign...and waited for my table.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of sushi.  Each roll I ate was tasty and service was very good.   I was pleased to find a great, little sushi spot and have eaten there many times in the last year...their takeout service is quick and easy too!  I may be moving back to CA but if and when I'm in Scottsdale again, I will certainly pay a visit to Hiro Sushi!",

We ordered the Rainbow roll, Crazy Roll and Crunchy California Roll.  All were pretty good. Not great (sorry) but good.   The people that work there are darling, nice and attentive.   Maybe I\"ve had too much sushi all over the planet,or am too picky (or spoiled with killer sushi?) but this was good,  not great.   Scottsdale peeps, try Dozo...it looks like an old Jack In the Crack from the outside, but inside? Pretty. Most importantly, they have awesome sushi.  Anyone in the Chandler/Awautukee area? Try Sushi Eye (on Warner)...",

Big selections of menu from appetizers to sushi, to entrees, and noodle dishes. We sat by the inner edge side of the sushi bar, and was greeted warmly by the sushi chef across from us.  We shared the Pork Katsu (probably one of the best from my memories of having this, it was fried to the golden color with white(?) meat inside, so delish!), Shrimp Tempura roll (good, like most of other place), Tuna Sashimi (we can taste the freshness, yum!), and Eel nigiri (decent, but prefer the ones at Sakana with much bigger size of the fish). The rice used for the sushi is a bit to the sticky side, but we both liked.   Service was a bit slow on the other side, my friend had to ask for water for a couple of times; overall the food was tasty. I'd definitely go back to check out more of the menu. btw, did I mention how much I liked the Katsu? I'd just go back for more of those! LOL",

    "text": "I've eaten sushi all over the country, and Hiro Sushi is hands down the best sushi in Arizona.  The location is a bit hidden away within the shopping center, and walking inside there aren't that many tables, but this smaller size gives more attention to the customer, and it results in great service from the staff!  I find that almost everything I order here is great. Everything is made consistently fresh and great regardless of time of year.   Hiro Sushi is also great for Japanese cuisine in general! The noodle soups and soba are other dishes I frequent, and there are excellent lunch and dinner packages that come with rice, soup, and salad.  My recommendation? Go for the specials! The fried fish and teapot soup are very light and tasty. Don't be afraid to ask for something that isn't there! Chances are if you ask the waitress they still have plenty of that favorite dish coming up!  It gets very crowded on a weeknight, so because of the small size of the restaurant, be sure to make a reservation a couple hours in advance. It's painful to wait an hour and watch people eat their fantastic food!  It's a bit expensive compared to happy hours at other places, but who eats sushi to SAVE money? Hiro is truly quality over quantity, and I have never felt I've wasted a single dollar.",

I want to eat everything with chopsticks... pizza... hotdogs... soup. whatever.   I was really in the mood for something spicy and I'm totally over the chain \"Japanese/sushi\" establishments, i really wanted something authentic. Yelp to the rescue!   It was a Friday night at about 8:30 and they were packed, I take that as a good sign. If the food is that good, I don't mind waiting. I was able to use my time to read the menu and decide on my meal.   My seat at the sushi bar was great. The chefs are so animated and alive. They all talk to each other in a funky mix of Japanese and English while they make your meal.   I started with the potstickers and they were delicious. Flavorful and hot and the perfect moistness, tenderness and crispy bottom. Perfect! Loved the scallion soy dipping sauce.  Then i had the Crazy Roll. This is shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado and cucumber. Huge and fresh and great. Could definitely have been way spicier for me, but I guess that's what wasabi is for.   I would definitely come back and try everything else!   One glass of wine, one appetizer and one roll = about $25 with tip. Not bad!",

It's void of a club scene, the quality of the food is stellar, and while it's not cheap, it's justifiable. Their udon, sashimi, salads, and rolls are all delicious, fresh, and expertly prepared. This is the place where my friends from Japan go to eat when they want Japanese food... that's right, no cougars or scenesters. Mostly Asians (always a great sign at sushi place), couples, and families. Oh, and their green tea is fantastic, as is their sake selection.  Hiro really knows its stuff when it comes to Japanese food, especially when compared to the other options in Scottsdale. I'd give them 5 stars, but the prices and total lack of atmosphere renders me a standard fan, not quite a cult follower.",

The lunch sushi combo is very generous and fills me up. I usually also order some steaming hot green tea. Whenever I close my eyes, I sip some tea, and let the Japanese that the staff are speaking to each other just wash over me.

    "text": "-Exquisite Sushi-  You know a sushi place is going to be legit when they serve items like maguro (bluefin), sake (salmon), and otoro but Sushi Hiro goes beyond the scope of what most sushi places in Phoenix serve by offering an array of hard to find goodies. Items like Hirame Engawa (Halibut Muscle), Uni (Sea Urchin), and Amberjack are all on offer here. More importantly is that they treat their dishes right as each nigiri comes with the appropriate brush of glaze like the Anago with its sweet soy based glaze.   The all Japanese chef team here have noticeable especially when you watch their knifework and sushi crafting. No sloppy cuts of fish or clumpy rice here and you can clearly see their talent and deftness with their tools.  Their nigiri and sashimi is excellent but I was pleased to see that they do the traditional fusion dishes that Chinese and Korean sushi owned joints excel at. Caterpillar roll came in at $13 and was topped with loads of avocado and unagi. More impressive was how thinly the chef was able to slice the avocado onto the roll. It seems minor but it changed the texture of the dish and made the avocados one of the best I've had topped on a roll.  Overall, I think Sushi Hiro is one of if not the best sushi places in Phoenix and able to compete with the more established sushi destinations on the West Coast. You simply can't find quality, value, and menu diversity elsewhere in Phoenix.   Having Asahi on Draft is icing on the cake.~",

Yeah, it's a little pricy but that's because you truly get what you pay for. The fish was so fresh and tasty and all the employees were super sweet and attentive. If you're jonesing for some amazingly delicious sushi, do your mouth, stomach, and emotional well-being a favor and eat here.",

The salmon skin hand rolls smelled fishy and tasted fishy on a few bites but then again, this is my first time eating salmon skin so I have no reference point.  Don't care to eat it again.  The lunch special came with miso soup and ginger salad, all of which were ordinary.  The waitress was not personable but helpful.  The sushi chefs were very nice and friendly.  The soba was very mediocre.  I'm used to going to Udon Soup Houses in New York City's Chinatown where they only make that so the soba here tastes like McDonald's version of soba.  I'm sure for Phoenix area, it is decent.  lol.  Won't be eating that again.  Once you eat at a Udon restaurant where they make the Udon fresh in front of your face, you can no longer this type of soup.    Overall I gave it 4 stars because the sushi was very good.  However this is Arizona after all so don't expect too much for other types of food.  lol.",

They regularly carry items that are hard to find at most other sushi restaurants in the area like sea eel (anago) and abalone (awabi). In addition to their regular selection of fish, they have a menu of special seasonal fish that changes from week to week. They put a lot of care into cutting and preparing the fish that they serve. You can also order izakaya-style cooked appetizers like yellowtail collar, fried squid legs, and fried smelt. Given the quality and freshness of ingredients, the prices are very reasonable.   The service is attentive and all of the sushi chefs are very friendly and accommodating to special requests.",

I was so excited to have some good quality, authentic sushi. Our waitress was nice, but definitely rushed. There wasn't a lot of talking let's just say LOL. But that was fine, I was there for the food! I had the chirashi which was so beautiful and tasty. The fish was fresh! I also had the smoked salmon nigiri which was the best I've ever had.... melts in your mouth deliciousness. My husband doesn't like sushi (lame I know) so he had an udon noodle bowl and vegetable tempura which were also good. We washed it all down with Kirin and hot sake. I will definitely return when I want good quality, authentic sushi!! The chefs appear to take great pride in their work, the presentation of the food is a piece of art and it was nice to see the owner there working hard as well :)",

The locals must know it is a very good restaurant.  We shared the Sashimi dinner plate that came with miso soup, salad and rice.  When we informed our server we didn't want the rice, she politely offered another soup or salad.  We also ordered the edamame.  The portions on the sashimi were small compared to what I have had from other places.  After finishing the sashimi we ordered unagi. That took a while to get to us, but again the restaurant was full at that time, so I understand why.  If sashimi were larger portions and/or if they offered other assorted sashimi plates with more pieces I would have given 5 stars.",

    "text": "So far, the best sushi that I have tried in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.   My friend and I came here on a Friday evening and the place was pretty packed, but we were seated by the sushi bar within 20 minutes upon arrival.  Ambiance:   The place is a small restaurant with one whole wall being dedicated to the sushi bar where you can see the sushi chefs cutting and preparing the sashimi, nigiri, and sushi creations. I noticed that on that same wall, the specials menu was up, and it looks like they have different fish and sea creatures every week or even daily. This restaurant really pays attention to their ingredients and makes sure they serve the best of the bets and the freshest fish they can get their hands on.   Staff:  Our waiters were friendly and attentive, constantly filling up our water glasses. The sushi chefs at the sushi bar although focused on their work, were friendly as they served us our sushi and asked if we needed anything else.  Sushi:  *Philly Roll* I ordered the most American sushi you can think of, but I usually always get this roll because it isn't as extravagant and then another fancy roll. My friend and I had charcuterie before coming here but were still hungry so we proceeded to Hiro to eat just one roll. Hence, just the order of one simple sushi roll.   *This is probably the best Philly Roll I have ever tried in Arizona. The fish was just SO fresh and I felt like I was eating sushi on the coast or dare I say, Japan?? I'm glad that I ordered a simple raw roll so I could really taste the fish from here. There's something about eating honest to goodness fresh, raw fish that is makes me feel fancier. Kind of like eating good caviar on a simple cracker. The rice on the roll wasn't too much or too little, was also fresh and not too sticky, and the cream cheese and avocado was fresh as well. Great job!  I will definitely have to come back to try different fish from here just because they have such a wide variety. Amazing service and amazing food! I highly recommend.",

    "text": "You can get any fresher than Hiro's in Greater Phoenix! We experienced a treat on Tuesday night when our party dined at Hiro Sushi. Thanks to the tips and recommendations of my Yelp community, we enjoyed a meal that that was better than five stars.  Tip: Make reservations, 5 pm if you can make it. There was a line forming even before the doors opened. Fortunately, we made reservations 3 weeks ago.  Even though they were extremely busy, my guests and I never felt rushed.  Now for the nosh: The hamachi or yellowtail and salmon grilled cheeks (kama) were fantastic. Flavorful and smoky from the habachi grill, the fish was tender and succulent.  We enjoyed 2 orders of spider roll (softshell crab). We also had shrimp tempura roll and a Vegas Roll.   One of the highlights of our meal was the beef teriyaki which was a steak seasoned and grilled to perfection. Everyone enjoyed a bite. It comes with rice, a cucumber salad and a delicious seaweed based salad.  We also enjoyed fresh sashimi (raw sliced fish). We had otoro (tuna belly), salmon belly (not on the menu but served up when we asked for it), and surf clam.  I thoroughly enjoyed the monkfish liver pate. It was creamy and tasty, rich with fish oils.  We were way too full for dessert. It was a fabulous evening of feasting!",

    "text": "Chirashi was a bad choice.  I had a high expectation from reading the review, so I decided to dine in.   Service was okay, it took forever to a long time until the server came, and none of the sushi chefs seemed to care. They seem nice though, and it was pretty busy so I understand.   The main issue I had was, the quantity. The quality isn't too bad, but considering the price, I wish I had either more fish or quality sushi. The rolls looked fine, but man, chirashi was certainly a mistake. I normally try to order chirashi when I visit other sushi places since it's like the standard you can sort of measure their quality of food.   The price came to almost 26 dollars just for a bowl, which is way more expensive than other restaurants. Again, if the quality was amazing, I wouldn't mind paying that, but it was seriously just a mediocre and wasn't enough.   I would love to try it another time and try different stuff, but my first experience certainly didn't live up to the amazing reviews. But again, chirashi was the bad choice, at least at this place.",

The variety of fish was ok, the quality was mediocre.   Fish does not have to be caught the same day to be the best tasting.  Ask Any sushi chef and he will tell you that there are certain species that taste better a few days old. So it comes to selection, storage, and cut.     Toro was served so cold it almost felt frozen, a few others were too cold as well.   Tai was not the same premium tai that you Might find at a 5 star sushi bar.   I'm sure there is a great sushi bar in the Phoenix area, but Hiro is not it.",

The location, in a strip mall on 90th street, is decidedly un-sexy.  We've been three three tims this year and I always see the same things: - Actual Japanese guys working the sushi bar - Actual Japanese people eating there - really fresh fish - Friendly staff  The restaurant has an ols school Japanese bistro feel.  The service is friendly and warm.  The sushi is spectacular.  We had salmos, Hamachi, Unagi, and tuna.  All were fresh, melt in your mouth tender and had the kind of flavor you want your sushi to have.  No tadpoles here.  No cloudy dilm.  Just pure, fresh from the ocean goodness.  They have some nice specialty rolls, and we tried a few.  Prices were reasonable.  Rolls average 8-10 bucks a pop.  Nigiri runs 4-7 bucks a pair.    Now, this is one Japanese place where I wat to try the actual food.  The tempura on the shrimp tempura roll is what other batters aspire to be.  Light, crunchy, not greasy.  Like the thought of batter.  I can only imagine what a plate of it would be like.  well, maybe I won't imagine.  Anyway, highly recommended.",

This is not to say that there is a dearth of sushi places available, just that most places suck.  However, Hiro had been recommended by several friends and, of course, there are glowing Yelp reviews.  So it was with high hopes that a friend and I stopped by for lunch a couple of weeks ago.    As mentioned in other reviews, the decor is not much to look at.  However, I have had good luck with other sushi places in strip malls (Hana, Yen & Yasu), so this did not really affect me.  Bring on the fresh fish and I'll forgive just about anything.  And Hiro delivered on this front.  The Toro was delicious and the Uni was just right.  We also took a run at the Hiro Roll, thinking that the restaurant's namesake roll would be a shining example.  Unfortunately, the flavors did not quite meld for me and the eel sauce was anything but special.  Perhaps it was the asparagus  . . .  I addition, I was not really impressed with the the flavors in the miso soup - it kind of felt like they were just going through the motions here.",

    "text": "I've been to 90% of the sushi restaurants in the Phoenix area and Hiro is always my baseline comparison. You can always tell if it's a sushi restaurant with True Japanese influence if they have good saba, hotate, and toro. Also, you can always tell if it's Americanized or not based off of how many rolls have cream cheese...out of the 18 rolls only 2 have cream cheese (and of course it's the Vegas roll and Philly roll). And c'mon they have an actual Japanese language menu, it doesn't get much more authentic than that, does it? Our routine order here is: Saba, hotate, hamachi, albacore, inari, zaru soba, hiyayakko (or agedashi tofu on a cold day), and of course a lovely, cold Gunma beer! I dare you to try that order and not walk out with a big smile on your face. To really get the full experience go with just 1 or 2 people and sit at the bar and chat with your sushi chef. Trust me, you'll have a great time!",

They make the caterpillar in the shape of a caterpillar with a caterpillar head. Very cool and creative but even better is the taste.  i had the Teriyaki chicken, my wife had the Teriyaki Chicken and tempura and my daughter had the chicken katsu and tempura. The dinners comes with salad and miso soup. The salad had a salty dressing but the soup was very good. The chicken teriyaki was all white meat and was a little dry but very good. The chicken katsu very good. I tried the tempura and this was very fresh and really good.  I would say to stick with the sushi and tempura. It's the best.  Overall I would say the place is very small and the service was pretty good. Next time we have a sushi craving we'll be back.",

The Ika was very crunchy, not hard to chew or stringy.  I wish there were a little more rice, because sushi should have equal balance of fish and rice.

Chefs are Japanese (you can see them make the sushi in front of you, especially if you sit on the stools at the bar-type table in front of them), and most waiters and waitresses are Japanese as well. Polite, and if you come there kinda often they might just smile and say hi when they run into you outside the restaurant too (True story).  Sushi recs: Jazz roll and Dragon roll. I know, I know, Jazz is more of a Louisiana thing and doesn't exactly sound legit as far as authentic Japanese food goes, but it's really, really good! It has that pink rice paper rather than the typical seaweed so it's a neat way to diversify your order.  Overall, favorite sushi place in Phoenix (and, to be fair, so good I kinda don't even want to try anything else..^^).",

We had to wait several times for our waitress and often another waitress showed up at her place. It was not a busy day so definitely service needs to improve. The sushi was good. Not extraordinary but enough for me to give it a second shot. I liked the crazy roll a lot.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Hiro for serval months now and finally stopped by. It's rated as one of the best sushi restaurants in Scottsdale but I'm sad to say it didn't live up to the hype. That's not to say it's bad, because it wasn't by any means, just not an overwhelmingly outstanding restaurant as I thought.   The hostess that sat us was a little rude but that can be overlooked. The waitress however, was so sweet! She was an absolute pleasure and saw to our every need. The list of sushi is extensive!! I didn't even know where to start. I ended up getting the California roll, Las Vegas roll, Sedona roll, and Crispy tuna roll.  The California was your typical run of the mill. The Las Vegas roll was pretty good but I feel had too much cream cheese. It almost looked as though half of the filling was cream cheese. Really good sauce though and a subtle sweet flavor. The crispy tuna roll was pretty spicy. Most of the roll is fried, which I didn't know before ordering. It almost reminded me of a hash brown topped with tuna. It was very good, just a little too fried for me. The one roll I didn't finish was the Sedona roll. This was another one that had a little crisp to it but it wasn't overwhelming. The overall flavors though were a little lackluster.  Maybe it was just the rolls I chose, but I wasn't too impressed. It was good quality sushi and I loved the small, intimate atmosphere. For the most part, the staff were friendly and welcoming. I think I'll give this place another try and order different rolls.",

I agree with another reviewer about how small this place is, they should really consider to expand this place because the food was FANTASTIC.  When I entered this place, the ambiance reminded me of the sushi place I used to go close to my school back then in Japan!  I ordered Las Vegas Roll and Chicken Teriyaki (dinner set), my boyfriend ordered the Spider Roll and Okinawa Soba. My thoughts of the food, - Las Vegas Roll, I took one piece and I was on cloud 9. This sushi is amazing, if only it wasn't $13.95, I could eat this roll over and over again. And my boyfriend took 2 pieces! Rawrrr!  - Spider Roll, this sushi tasted delicious as well!  - Chicken Teriyaki (dinner set) comes with miso soup. The miso soup was so fresh, it tasted so original, even my boyfriend said that's a really good miso soup right there. And the chicken teriyaki was so tasty, the rice that comes with it was fresh and sticky. That's the best part of it! !  - Okinawa Soba, I sipped the soup first and I could taste the ginger, not gonna lie, it was pretty strong but it warmed up my body right away. The pork that comes with it was super tender! My boyfriend loves it!  We spent around $60, it's pretty damn expensive but it's definitely worth it! We will definitely be coming back to try their other menu!",

All of the fish was so fresh and exquisitely prepared. I highly recommend the crispy spicy tuna sushi, it's like nothing I've ever had before. They present the spicy tuna on a crispy fried cube of rice, with a slice of avocado, a jalapeno slice and a garlic chip. The presentation is immaculate and will get your mouth salivating just looking at it! My absolute favorite, and honestly the best sushi I've had to my memory, was the Toro roll with scallion. Just to die for. The fish was so soft and mouth watering. I'm drying for more just thinking of it! Plan yourself a fun night out and start with Hiro Sushi to get you feeling right",

    "text": "Hiro Sushi is a really good sushi spot, full of fresh fish and traditional rolls. The wait can be a little frustrating because the inside is so small that pretty much only bar seating is available without reservations. Service is very efficient and generally good, although the ordering system can be a little confusing because I was unsure of whether to order with the waitress or the sushi bar chef (I think sushi orders go to the sushi bar chef and entree orders go to the waitress).   One thing I've noticed is that the same dish rarely comes out with the same presentation twice. I've ordered repeat dishes three times, and each time it's come out differently presented with variable garnish and dressing. It's a nice surprise each time, as each preparation is pleasant, but can be unexpected.  Appetizers: Ankimo is steamed to perfection and comes with multiple sauces to choose from. I prefer the ponzu sauce to the sweet miso, but both bring out that really nice creaminess of the ankimo. The fried soft shell crab is tender and juicy, but I'm not a huge fan of the breading; I think it could be a little thinner, but of course there's always the chance that it was a fluke because I've only ordered it once.  Nigiri and sashimi: The uni nigiri is served with the traditional nori wrap, and it has always been fresh and sweet in the times I've ordered it. The amaebi is very fresh, and this is the first place that's also taken the time to remove the tails. The fried heads also had the shells removed, which I appreciated, although I think they were slightly overfried. The salmon and hamachi sashimi are absolutely top notch. I adore hamachi, and the cuts and preparation here are definitely on my list of top five. Not only have the cuts been impeccable, glistening, and texturally perfect, the temperature is spot on as well. Hamachi can often be served too cold, but the room temperature with just a hint of chilled here is perfect.   Rolls: I've pretty much tried all of the rolls on the menu, and I've generally found them to be well-made. Continuing with the more traditional theme, the rolls here are tightly wrapped, on the smaller side, and sport typical combinations. There are some I prefer more than others, especially the ones without crunch (tempura bits) on top because I find them a bit oily. I'd definitely recommend the nigiri and sashimi over the rolls, but that's because the fresh fish is really the star at Hiro Sushi.   Bento box: The bento boxes comes with soup, salad, rice, and a pickled side. The pickled radish was pretty darn good, and I haven't had that very often because not many places offer it. The miso soup was nicely balanced and served with chunks of soft tofu, and this version didn't have any seaweed or green onion. The chicken katsu was hands down the best preparation of katsu I've tasted thus far -- it was light, perfectly fried on the outside, and juicy on the inside. The breading wasn't too thick and the seasoning was spot on. It seems like such a simple dish, but it's really hard to make right. The salmon teriyaki was pretty good, but the chicken katsu definitely stole the spotlight.   Hiro Sushi's claim to fame is definitely their understanding of fresh fish, and I'm dreaming about the hamachi sashimi even as I write this review. Their chicken katsu is an unexpected love for me as well, and I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this spot for quite a while and finally got the chance to last night. This spot is one of our friends' favorite sushi joints and I can see why now.   It is a very small restaurant and it was pretty packed last night. I think we waited about an hour but the wait was totally worth it. Everything was so darn good.   Let's see what I actually remember eating... we had a few drinks before arriving and then ordered a big bottle of sake and a few beers once we sat. Wasabi octopus sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, mackerel, blue fin sashimi, agedashi tofu, roasted eggplant appetizer, sliced mushroom appetizer, edamame, blue fin roll, salmon roll, lollipop roll, more blue fin sashimi (because it was melt-in-your-mouth amazing) and some sort of mushroom soup that was served in a teapot.   Let me please tell you that the mushroom soup was friggin amazing - if you love mushrooms like we do. After drinking it all up, we dug into the pot for the goodies. It reminded me of all the broth-like soups I had growing up. Just pure.   If I had to rank my top 5 out of the items we ordered, it would be: mushroom soup, blue fin sashimi, agedashi tofu, mushroom appetizer, mackerel, and then the edamame. I know it's weird that edamame made my list but their edamame was just simply good. I've had edamame at other places that are overwhelmed with salt or tasted like they were frozen for too long. Not sure how Hiro prepared theirs but it had just a taste of salt, which I liked. Oh dang it, I listed 6 items. Oh well.   Service was great too - lots of great recommendations from our server. Solid 5 stars.",

I liked how they served the sushi one roll at a time - allowing you to really enjoy the individual roll for what it's worth.  It was busy on a Friday night around 5:15 PM. All the tables were taken and the bar was completely full. It wasn't loud in the restaurant, everything was clean, fresh, and we were attended to frequently.  For 4 rolls, a large beer and a rice wine dinner was $74 before tip - worth it for the fresh fish and combinations they offered. We shared a blue fin roll not pictured.  Would definitely come back!",

The only downside is how tiny this place is, it's probably got less than 20 tables and a sushi bar you can sit at and watch the sushi being prepared.   FOOD  We had the gyoza appetizer and it was good.   We also ordered several rolls: eel roll (amazing but we LOVE eel), spider roll, and a few others I cannot remember the names of...but it was all pretty good!!   I don't think the spider roll was a favorite of ours for the meal but everything else was pretty damn good!!",

    "text": "The selection and quality of the fish is very good, especially for Arizona.  I had toro, uni, maguro, hamachi, and saba.  The toro was less fatty than I would have liked, but it was still toro.  The uni was nice and sweet with a firm texture (I forgot to ask where it was sourced from, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't Santa Barbara).  The maguro was perfect, as was the hamachi.  And now we come to saba.  Saba is a fish that a lot of sushiyas don't pay attention to.  When they don't, it's a disaster.  When they do, it's delicious.  Hiro Sushi pays attention and the saba was fantastic.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Some of the best sushi in town, right up there with Yasu, Hana, and the like. Unpretentious (I dare say \"bare bones\") strip mall spot with about 12 tables and maybe 18 seats at the sushi bar. Not a scottsdale scene at all. Good $10-18 lunch specials that are large and hearty. Sushi prices are about average for the valley. It's always fresh, always high quality, and always delicious. Hiro watches over the show and makes sure all the quality is up to his standards. There's always something rare or unusual on the specials board that other more standard sushi places would never carry (like conch, giant clam, jellyfish, toro, etc). Service is ok, though the servers tend to be a little confused and try to do too many jobs. If you're at the sushi bar just ask your chef and he'll set the servers straight. It can be crowded at night so be sure to call for a reservation if you're more than one or two people. Only complaint I have is that the cooked food from the kitchen doesn't keep up with the quality of the sushi. Cooked food is kind of an afterthought here. They have some standard items but if you're looking for something adventurous or a nice steak this isn't your spot. But if you're feeling sushi, go here for sure.",

I have been there three times now, and have loved every visit.  It is a place to eat and enjoy the food, not a strangely-lit cocktail lounge pretending to be a sushi bar.  The fish is fresh, the edamame is warm and salty, and the beer is cold.  What else can you ask for?  Thank you Hiro Sushi!",

It's in a strip mall of course and the building looks really plain from the outside.  But when you go in, you'll find a cute sushi place that has pretty good food.   They have creative sushi rolls in colored soybean paper (pink, yellow and blue)- I've never seen that before.  And although I'm not very daring when it comes to sushi, I did try a few different ones.  I liked the Jazz roll, which had shrimp, asparagus and some other things, and I thought that one was delish.  I thought the Crazy roll was just okay, and that one has spicy tuna, avocado, fried shrimp and something else in it.  The Arizona roll was pretty tasty too, it has asparagus, cucumber and scallops.    If you like sushi, you should definitely give this place a try.  It's always fun to try somewhere new and the prices are on par with other sushi restaurants I've been to. Just don't rake me over the coals if you go and decide this is the worst sushi ever.  Remember, I'm not a sushi connoisseur!",

Hiro, the owner, is from Japan and is typically working on the bar - they seem to be having a good time back there, rolling up a storm.  I'd recommend reservations for groups of 4 or more.

Just visiting Scottsdale with my family, looked through Yelp for a Japanese restaurant and was excited to come here due to all the great reviews. When we walked in, the host was great, extremely friendly. When we were greeted by our server Judy, she had an attitude & was rude. I noticed that it was an added gratuity of 18% for parties 6 or more. My family and I were 6 altogether. From the get go, I knew I would be unsatisfied with the service. She got our drinks & when we were going to order, she was rushing and had the attitude like \"I've got better things to do than stand and take your orders\". There were 6 of us, after every person she would say \"is that all?\" Like hello, you see 6 or us. Do you think only 2 will order while the rest just sit here & look pretty? Nope. Rude, unacceptable and unprofessional. I'm a server as well and could care less if you're having a bad day. You work for you tip, you're not entitled to it. If this wasn't an added gratuity I wouldn't have left more than 10%. All in all, the food was good, service was unacceptable, I was highly disappointed and will not be back.",

    "text": "My first visit to Hiro was a delight! I came in for dinner and sat up at the bar where sushi chef Leo was really friendly and offered up some helpful suggestions.  I started with the $2 miso soup which was not watered down and had some meaningful chunks of tofu in it and was just right to warm me up on this cold AZ day. I ordered the Houston roll and the Crazy roll for my main meal and while I waited I eyed the slabs of fishmeat hungrily.  My Houston Roll was up first - really smooth fatty salmon slices with julienned cucumbers and scallions, an inside out roll. The total effect wasn't especially overwhelming, more of a palate for wasabi and soy sauce. But good quality maki for sure. The Crazy Maki is Leo's favorite I'm told, and I can see why. First of all, I have never had a soy paper roll, that was fun (and pink!).  The Crazy Maki has a tempura shrimp rolled up with spicy tuna, avocado and roe. Most restaurants make the tuna with spicy mayonnaise, but this was mayo free (i'm a mayo-phobe) and ultra silky in texture. the maki is a fattie but because it's rolled in soy paper you can eat it in bites, unlike seaweed rolls which if you try to bite will empty their contents on your shirt and lap while everyone in the restaurant stares at you. so yay for soy paper!   I have one singular criticism: the wasabi was not spicy. i was putting a quarter-sized amount on each sushi piece just to get a tingle - so I ran out quickly and didn't ask for more (what for). Have all my tastebuds died? do they make particularly weak wasabi at Hiro's? I don't know but I'm prepared to do some arduous wasabi studies at Hiro Sushi for the rest of my life.",

Maybe it was because both days I went were on Mondays. I've heard that Mondays and sometimes Sundays aren't the prime days to eat sushi due to when they get their shipments in. That's the only thing I can think of. Both times we had sushi that tasted well...fishy.  We ordered a few appetizers, the yellow tail cheek, baked mussels, and baked clams. The yellow tail cheek I've never had before so I have nothing to compare it to but it was a little crispy and burnt on the outside and I didn't much care for it. You had to dig through all the bones to get just a few little scraps of fish. The sauce they served with it was good though.  The spicy baked mussels and clams were in a mayo sauce that was okay but not fantastic. Normally my favorite part of these dishes is the sauce, but the mayo didn't seem thick enough and both came out soupy and lacking flavor. They were just mediocre.   We ordered the tuna tataki & albacore tataki. I thought the tuna tataki tasted very fishy and so did one of my dining partners. Our other dining partner thought it was okay though and ate our portions. The albacore tataki was seared quite a bit on the outside, giving it a rubbery texture that made it not taste right. I didn't care for either.   We ordered a lot- various nigiri, spicy scallop roll, spicy tuna roll, Houston roll (salmon, onion, cucumber), jazz roll, Arizona roll, rainbow roll, and I'm sure others. I thought the spicy scallop and Houston roll were the best but nothing was out-of-this-world. I just wasn't impressed either time we went there. 2.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service.",

Don't get me wrong this place is great they have a wide variety, friendly and quick staff, and it is really off the beaten path. It is pretty small and quaint, ( I actually had a debate with a person I went with here, can something be both small and quaint?) Either way, it's nice inside, you get a cozy sushi feeling. The Miso soup is great, and the shashimi is fresh, and cut into big pieces. The prices are OK,  the down side, no happy hour of any kind.  It is a small place, so I can see why they don't have a happy hour. I highly recommend this place to all sushi lovers, you won't be disappointed. It's very clean and inviting.  In the terms of atmosphere, I was tempted to get hammered off saki here, (though I only had 1 Sapporo)  it's that type of place that you want to do shots of Saki with the sushi chef's and pass out on a plate of ahi tuna, to awaken with a tattoo on your arm that says \"Konichiwa Bitches\" and has a picture of Morimoto the Iron Chef from Japan, it's that quaint ;).",

I don't know what it is, but the hostesses at the front of the restaurant have been particularly rude and unwelcoming for the past 3/5 visits. Hiro is very busy and very small with few seats. If you haven't got reservations expect to feel like an enormous burden if you come to eat here. It honestly feels like all the hostesses are 10th grade girls who don't know how to accommodate a party without a reservation. It's as if they haven't dealt with such a perplexing situation before. I wouldn't have let this shortcoming bother me so much if the staff didn't have such poor self control. After seating our party at the bar, one of the hostesses said, \"You REALLY should get reservations if you're going to eat here\" as she walked away. We live a mile from this place and sometimes decide to eat here in the spur of the moment... It's just poor form and not the kind of attitude that should be present in a quality dining establishment.  Food-wise, I can't speak highly enough of the sashimi. The quality and freshness of the fish is apparent. i haven't explored the sushi scene in cities like LA or SF but would imagine Hiro humbly rivals the quality of the best in these culinary hot spots. Once your seated, the staff seem to all be delightful and professional.",

    "text": "What a wonderful sushi restaurant.   If you want trendy, or a place to see and be seen, head further west to Ra or Stingray.   On the other hand,  if you are looking for outstanding quality, fresh fish and attentive service, then this is your (and our) place.  Yes, it is small, but the intimacy always seems to create a special ambiance. Appetizers:  the soft shell crab with a ponzu sauce is incredible.  Last night, one of the specials was Washington oysters on the half shell; plump,  juicy, and not overly briny.  Just fresh and delicious.   All of the sushi & sashimi are recommended.   We always enjoy the negiri Toro roll, eel & cucumber roll, sesame roll, any of the clams, and flying fish roe. Sea urchin may be an acquired taste, but if you enjoy the taste of the sea, please give it a try.  We always end our meal with the tenzaru,  soba noodles with tempura served with a soy based dipping sauce (add scallions, wasabi,  and quail egg).  So, all in all, just a fabulous place.  And you'll be so well taken care of; we'll keep our favorite waitress a secret, but they're all terrific!",

    "text": "There is a great scene in the movie High Fidelity where John Cusack's character, Rob Gordon is \"dying a long slow death\" at a dinner party full of pretentious, nouveau riche snobs, including the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones. Rob thinks to himself..... \"Of course there's envy: why isn't my life like this? Sure I want their money and clothes and jobs and opinions. And I'd like to have advice on jet lag, but that's not it. I mean they're not bad people and I'm not a class warrior, it's something else.\"   If I were to sit here and attempt to write an educated, articulate and accurate appraisal of how good Hiro's sushi is than I would be just like one of those snobs Rob so despised.  I wish I could tell you how I could taste the freshness of Hiro's tuna, or how the mackerel was served at just the right temperature, but I need to recognize my culinary limitations. I have never lived near the ocean. I have never been to Japan, and until about two years ago all I ever knew of sushi were the ubiquitous \"rolls\" that we have come to know all too well.   Lately however I have been ordering more sashimi and nigiri trying to learn the nuanced flavors of the fish, rice and combination of the two. I will try to stop dunking everything in soy sauce and wasabi, and whenever possible I will order omakase and let the chef take over.   For the time being I believe that Hiro is a really good place to continue my sushi education. My first visit went well. The restaurant itself certainly passes the eyeball test. Hiro appears to be very authentic. The service was friendly and fast, and the fish portions were very generous. And yes, everything I had tasted wonderful, I just don't yet have the expertise to be able to honestly explain exactly why it was better than other sushi joints around town.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner last night just because I craved for sushi and not knowing how sushi places taste like here I just decided on this one due to good yelp reviews. Well some of the rolls and sushi we ordered were either a hit or miss..  $4.95 2pc - Salmon Sushi was great - big fatty piece of salmon, hint of wasabi and just the right amount of rice underneath.   $5.50 2pc - Yellowtail Sushi wasn't bad either.   $4.95 2pc - Albacore Sushi - ehh not a big fan of albacore.  $12.95 Spicy Ribbon roll - consist of spicy tuna in the center and topped with salmon and avocado - liked it  $6.95 Spicy Scallop Roll - ehhh not sure I like it as a roll...usually it's the two piece with the seaweed wrapped outside and the scallops are on top. but this one is a full roll and I got tired of the taste by the third bite.   $5.95 Salmon Skin Roll - again this wasn't really good as a roll...better as a hand roll...   Overall the service was great I even tipped an additional four dollars to the sushi chef that served us at the bar and they were constantly clearing out our empty plates. The food on the other hand was just so-so...tasted semi-fresh...not like it's right out of the ocean..lol but going in I didn't expect it to taste like it's right out the ocean after all we are in the desert! This was a relatively small restaurant...it was quite busy though. The prices were pretty high....we ended up eating like $50 something dollars worth of sushi...we don't usually surpass $40 for two in California with the same amount of food and of good fresh quality. But eh I guess it somewhat curbed my sushi craving for the time being.",

Either way, I attest that Hiro stands out above the sushi fray in Scottsdale where there's a sushi joint for every man, woman & child. If you don't believe me, well... more sushi for me.   Hiro is not a place to be seen. Its about the chow, and to say its old school is like saying Sarah Palin might have had an Alex P Keaton poster on her wall in high school.   The fish is spectacular, the plating is gorgeous, but perhaps most notable is the expertise. I sat in front of Take, one of the four chefs on staff and was mezmerized watching him cut fish. I mean.... I've been to some acclaimed sushi restaurants.. but there is just something when you watch someone who lives this stuff, rather than just someone who's come to it by trade.   On my last visit, there were a number of Japanese businessmen who came in, with their own sake, and sat in front of Hiro himself. This says a lot, and if you experience the same, follow our advice: say to the chef: \"we'll have whatever they have\".",

They used to advertise lunch specials and happy hour to get customers in the door and oddly I never heard any comments about it until YELP.  With so many great compliments in Yelp, my hubby and I decided to give it a try.  We ordered the calamari to start and it was very delicately done but not much of it.  They have mackerel but it is called spanish mackerel--it was still very good.  We enjoyed a tasty assortment of sushi that was beautifully presented.   My only gruff is that the sushi crab is the fake Krab, but at least they note it on the menu.",

The sushi was fabulous, with many exotic options that are just not found in very many places in Arizona. The sushi and rolls were fresh, pretty, and delicious.

    "text": "I've been searching for high quality sushi for months, and I finally found it!    Hiro is a smaller, unpretentious establishment with enthusiastic and well-trained sushi chefs. We sat at the sushi bar (we opted for first-available seating)--I loved watching the chefs slice each cut of fish with precision and flawless technique.   Hiro gets my stamp of approval because they actually listened to me when I said I wanted a LOT of ginger. Yes, an entire plate piled high is what I mean by a lot!  Thank you Hiro!  We had edamame (perfectly cooked with just the right amount of salt), the squid salad (the sauce was the perfect compliment to the fish), crazy roll, striped roll, and unagi, tuna and scallop nigri. Each cut of fish was extremely generous and tasted fresh. There was a LOT of rice in the crazy roll, which was good (balanced out the tempura shrimp) and bad (I prefer to fill up on fish, not rice).     Everything is made-to-order, and the chefs hand over the plates with pride; I've been to countless sushi joints where the chefs whip out as much product as they can without giving any care to the quality.  Not at Hiro!  Everything comes together deliciously because of their carefully prepared components.   We finished with the hot green tea--no need for sugar here because of its subtle (not artificial!) sweetness.  My favorite part was the mochi!  They serve the best kind, something I've been searching for since Sushi Den and Izakaya Den (premier sushi restaurants) in Denver. We had the red bean and green tea. Mochi is hard to describe, but its a creamy, perfectly portioned, and refreshing treat!",

The cucumber rolls were dry, and the spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail rolls were mediocre at best. Overall, the quality of their sashimi was good, but you'll have to pay for it.

The sushi selection was just OK on the night that we went.  The fish:rice ratio was right on.  The rolls were not over-stuffed with rice either.  They have a very good selection of sake and authentic appetizers.  More importantly the selections ranged quite a bit in freshness and quality.  Some of the more expensive nigiri pieces were very good, but the $2.95 nigiri menu items were awful such as the eel and the ebi.     In my book, selling old and bad fish is inexcusable at any cost.

My mother in law lives in Japan comes back to visit once a year and she always insists on coming to Hiro, because she remembers it as being most similar to sushi in Japan.     In Japan, my inlaws don't actually order food.  They simply let the Sushi chef choose what he feels like feeding us.  If you operate under this principle at Hiro Sushi, prices will augment.",

Instead you will find this a solid family business restaurant with clean interior, fresh and authentic sushi. The owner and head chef is always there and you will often find quite some japanese regulars hanging there. Isn't this always a good sign to tell if the food is authentic ;)   Both the nigiri and rolls are good. Try their scallop and must have is salmon. They have the freshest in town. Uni (sea urchin) is always fresh there too.",

Only drawback ? they're kicking you out of there at 10 pm on a Friday night, hence the fall to 4 stars....",

You will have the legit Japanese style sushi restaurant experience.  The quality and freshness of the fish is top notch.  Be sure to check out the specials on the board for some out of this world flavors.  I got both maki rolls and sashimi and loved them all.  The spanish mackerel was wonderful.  The fish was neatly presented and they even deep fried the leftover bones and head which was 100% edible and super tasty in the vinegar sauce.

There is a difference in fresh sushi that you can taste.  Now if you think places like RA serves fresh sushi then you don't have a clue,  just trust me.    The prices are decent to a little high compared to other joints but remember you pay for what you get.  I would recommend this place for date.  Sit at the bar if you can.   You may want to make reservation to make sure you have a seat.  We got seated right away but as we were sitting we noticed how a bunch of people kept coming in and people were constantly waiting to be seated.",

With daily specials written on the wall including conch (From Florida) in miso to spicy scallop rolls that are sweet and spicy.  The seaweed salad is always a great way to being your meal, Hiro's tempura was crispy and light, and the sushi was very fresh.    It is so hard to find a REAL sushi house and this one that I will be going back again and again!  The service was great all in all from beginning to finish.    We walked in not knowing what to expect, the prices seemed reasonable for sushi and we walked out knowing this hidden gem, is the place to be for sushi !    P.S.

We are all instantly greeted with foreign japanese by the many sushi chefs banked across the side at the bar.  We smile and I realize this is as authentic as it gets! (there is a page in the menu that is completely japanese!) My family and I have tried this place before, but we couldn't get in it was so packed and for a Thursday night there was a great showing.   My mother and I end up splitting a couple of rolls and some nigiri and I had some sunamono-it's always my vice. I liked every roll that we ordered, even the philly roll, my mother has a thing for cream cheese. (really not my thing) All the fish was fresh and tasty! My brother and my father ordered miso soup and both decreed that they gave it their approval- we are very picky with out miso! The servers were extremely attentive and brought us whatever we needed.   I felt that this was a great place being the only non asian family dining here. I really like a place that doesn't throw out \"HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS\" (ending up being old fish) and \"artificial krab\" (yucckk!) I will gladly spend a little more for fresh real fish and a nice authentic atmosphere without all the fried fake americanized sushi. (fried krab covered with globs of sugary sauce is NOT sushi whatever anyone says)  It's bittersweet that I have finally found a delicious sushi place that I can always go to for a fantastic meal when I am moving out of the state for college next week. Oh well, it will become a delectable treat whenever I come home or if I get really pathetic and need my real sushi fix maybe my mom will ship me some? hint hint :) just kidding.  Fabulous place I will be back very soon!",

Having lived in Japan, I have tasted the real good sushi and other traditional Japanese dishes like udon, tonkatsu.   The fish is always fresh, some flown in from Japan. On a regular night, Hiro and his sons are behind the counter, making sushi for the customers.  During the cooler months, I like to order the nabeyaki udon and some rolls like toro, caterpillar, rainbow, spicy tuna etc.  The nigiri and sashimi are amazing.  Sometimes, I like to order the bento selection with tempura and tonkatsu as my favorite choices.  The tempura here is just the way it should be, light and crunchy.  Seriously, Hiro Sushi is an oasis in the desert state of Arizona, can't get any better... Totemo oichi desu...  (very delicious)",

The tempura is light, fluffy, and seasoned. Most of all, it doesn't taste like it belongs on an onion ring. The calamari is tossed in a light sauce that elevates the dish from good to awesome. If you like sushi that is deep-fried five different ways and stuffed with cream cheese, this is not the place for you. If you like fresh fish, bold flavors, and a friendly staff, go to Hiro. The long line of people clamoring to get in on any given night is a great indication of what to expect once you get in.",

    "text": "This place gets it right on all levels.  Extremely friendly and attentive staff, knowledgable and enthusiastic sushi chefs, superior grade sashimi, an eclectic variety of specials, and a menu that offers everything from Soba noodles to Chicken Teriyaki.  On our visit, we sampled the following specials:  Jellyfish Sunomono (a jellyfish and cucumber salad.  Jellyfish has virtually the same texture and taste as a seaweed salad) Ankimo or Monkfish Pate: It is essentially a sea foie gras and comes from a fish whose flavor is likened to lobster.  On its own the flavor is lacking, but dipped in a citrus ponzu it is delectable! Agemono Ibodai or Fried Butterfish: Even though the fish is served whole, the tender meat from the belly is cut up, fried individually, and made easy for eating by hand.  For our main course, we asked the sushi chef to create a Sashimi plate for us.  It included:  Kazunoko, or Herring roe.  It was pinkish, firm, and with a rubbery texture and appearance.  It came in a single cohesive mass and so it looked like a piece of sushi, but was crunchy and overall strange. Abura Bouzu or Escolar.  This is not to be confused with white tuna, or pretty much any type of sushi you have ever had.  I have to say that it was the most delectable, soft, creamy, rich fish I have ever had.  Better than a cut of Bluefin Toro!  Bright white in color and quite fatty, this fish is not always easy to find - in fact you will rarely see it on sushi menus due to the high levels of fatty esters.  It is known to cause digestive issues with some individuals, and for that reason has been prohibited in Japan since the 1970s.  I myself had mild cramping later that evening, but I can honestly say it's worth it! Whitefish: Less fatty than salmon.  It certainly has a lighter, smoother flavor - but I prefer more fat and texture in my sushi. Ahi Maguro or Yellowfin Tuna: Beautiful deep red color, soft, meaty texture and clean taste.  Wonderful fish!  With a large bottle of hot Osake Sake, our bill was about $100.  I believe the majority of the cost came from the chef's special sashimi platter, as the average cost of a special was about $8.  This is definitely a place for people who know and love good sushi, and would highly recommend it.  Not only for the quality of its dishes, but the wonderful service.",

    "text": "Hiro is probably the best place to get sushi in the Valley area. It is a small, yet high volume restaurant- so if you're going around the 7-8pm-ish times, be sure to make a reservation as sometimes we see groups waiting in the front for decent periods of time.   Their nigiri is really the best in Arizona. I've gone to plenty of sushi spots, and none can compare to the quality of Hiro's nigiri. They serve a great portion of fish with the perfect amount rice to go with it. Their fish is always fresh and always melts in your mouth. Recommendations: yellowtail, salmon, and albacore. I usually don't wander from my comfort zone when it comes to nigiri, but these never disappoint.   Now for the rolls. I know that True sushi really doesn't include rolls, but, hey. How could you go wrong? Their Las Vegas roll is AMAZING. Probably The best I've ever eaten. Crunch on the outside, and warm, smoked delicious salmon on the inside with gooey cream cheese! Yum!  Be sure to try the crazy roll as well! It comes in pink wrapping instead of the traditional green seaweed paper.  The rolls are also a decent size for what you pay for. One Las Vegas ($12.95) roll is enough to fill me for lunch on a regular day!  Their caterpillar rolls and rainbow rolls are also picks that I frequently see when dining there.   The service (and i mean waitresses) is pretty good. Not great, not bad, just good. All they do is pretty much bring you your rolls/nigiri/sashimi whatever and then leave. But nothing to complain about.  The sushi chefs are great though! If you have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar- do so. Because you can always make conversation with the chefs who know just about everything about the menu and they are funny and polite. They also give the restaurant an authentic Japanese feel because they speak Japanese!   Other recommendations: the sweet and sour cucumber salad. Usually it comes right before the sushi and makes a delicious and light appetizer! (They also serve teriyaki chicken and things that are more kid friendly, but I have yet to try them!!)",

I walked in and spoke to the chefs right away in Japanese and they spoke right back to me in the same language.  My first test.  Then order some basic nigiri sushi.  It was very good.  The fish was fresh and the selection was fantastic.  The sushi rice was very good also which is the key to good sushi - (my dad is a sushi chef).  I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant that also American inspired \"rolls\".",

There were so many moving parts to my day:  * I rode my mountain bike to Tempe to see the Tour de Fat:)  * I had to play Squash at the club:)  * I had football on the TiVo that really needed my attention:)  * Oh yeah, Carin had a pretty big photo shoot that she was managing, and she asked me to help her with \"model wrangling\" for a little while...(she didn't call it that...she's far more refined than I am...she asked me to help sign people in and make sure they got where they needed to be...but I call it \"model wrangling\":-)  Where do I get the energy? :)  After a busy day, it was time for a dinner party with the photographer, the owners of the business, and selected guests from the shoot...interesting people and a wonderful mix for great conversation...which makes for a great dinner party:)  Hiro Sushi had been selected for the party and they did not disappoint:)  Hiro San has been a sushi master since 1968 and knows his way around a sushi bar (as do all of his assistant chefs:)  Hiro likes his boats, and all the sushi, sashimi and rolls were delivered to the table in traditional sushi boats...that's presenting your fish old school...and I approve (I have too...I went to an old school...back in olden days:)  Fresh tasting and delicious, the food came in waves ebi, maguro, iki, ikura, uni and anago, along with Arizona Roll (vegetarian...not my favorite), Caterpillar Roll and Spider Roll while we all enjoyed Kirin and hot and cold sake:-)  Hiro doesn't really have a party room, but they created a nice little spot for us all and we all laughed and talked and drank and ate and it was just a wonderful night.  We've been to Hiro before and the food and service are always top notch:)  The ambience in the restaurant is a little bit pedestrian...it kind of feels to me like a strip mall sushi bar (which it is, although the food is an order of magnitude better than most strip mall sushi:)  And creativity isn't really Hiro's strong suit...good and fresh sushi always, but not always presented as art.  Does that make a difference?...I don't know for sure...it can be an important part of the equation for me:)  That said, I like Hiro's...a lot:)  A lot better than I like model wrangling...it's really not my cup of dirty chai latte....it was like herding cats...pretty, pretty cats:)",

I am always pleased after my visit.  If fact, I don't think I ever left this restaurant unhappy.  I took people from Japan, California, and you know those who thinks they can't get good sushi in the desert. All the people I took, they were pleased with the qualify of food.  For lunch, my favorite is chirashi. If you want, ask for deluxe chirashi (not on a menu).  They will make the best chirashi you ever had by using the best ingredients they have.  For dinner, I like to order food in Japanese izakaya (tapas) style. We start with different appetizers (including sashimi platter) to share with the group, then order sushi to finish. My favorite appetizer (again not on the menu) is kiwi salmon.  I like everything on the menu but sometimes like to ask them to make something other than what's on the menu.  Don't forget to look for daily special menu on the wall too.  I highly recommend to make reservation for dinner as they get busy even during the week.",

The sushi chef didn't seem to care that the rolls were sloppily .cut over big and super small and slapped on a plate. We had the \"lobster\" roll to start which was worse than premade sushi at a grocery store - NO Lobster at all! fake crab mayo and supposedly some langoustines and pinkish color - MY Bad - I didn't read the separate ingredient list --YUK 1/10. - tried to up the game with more of a specialty roll - Lollipop- this time he manages to cut everything the same - small small portion what a ripoff for $14.95 - then a salmon skin roll - mostly loosely made rice almost no salmon skin uneven cutting, no presentation. It's a pretty dirty worn place nowadays. Seemingly they're going to be renovating soon. They should renovate their food quality, presentation, pricing and service also. If this was our first visit we would have never returned.",

But, my answer to that question is YES!  Especially if that sushi comes from Hiro.  I recently went to Hiro to celebrate a friend's birthday.  There were four of us and we ordered a variety of salads, rolls, and other menu offerings.  Every single thing we ordered was amazing... and oh so fresh!  Highlights included oysters, salmon sashimi that melted in my mouth, and the Arizona roll.    Service was attentive as well, and when it came time for dessert, the lights went out in the entire restaurant while the staff sang to my friend and brought out orange slices with a candle in it... the perfect sweet (and healthy) ending to a fabulous meal!  I will definitely be returning to Hiro and soon.  Anyone craving sushi? Let me know!",

So we decided to wait meanwhile a man cane in and said cancel my reservation for 2 please. So we were supposed to get his table instead we waited outside in the heat for about 40 minutes then had to leave for another engagement. I'm not one to complain but it bothered me, I called the next day and asked for a manager. I spoke to Ricky he was really nice and apologetic. He informed me next time we come in ask for him and we would be taken care of. Well we decided to give it another try lastnight as we walked in the same rude lady was up front I said reservation for 2 and I said Ricky said to ask for him. She said Ricky isn't here again I said he told me to mention him when we came back, again she said well he isn't here. I was like well we still want to dine here , basically she was like here's a table and out menus down. Her attitude killed the mood and we decided to get up and leave. Customer service is key!!

I asked the waitress if the sushi chef could make the Handrolls extra spicy and was immediately cut off to say \"no already pre-made. We should have known to cancel the order and go  ala carte.

    "text": "This was a great find.  We were looking in north Scottsdale for a sushi place that wasn't super high-end, but every place we saw was only 3.5 stars (I need higher than that to go for sushi).    Based on the Yelp reviews, we decided to take the 10 minute dive to Hiro.  Man, are we glad we did!  It's a little hole-in-the wall place in a strip mall that only seats 42 (according to the max occupancy sign) and has the glass on the front door that obscures light, so we didn't even know if it was open.  When we walked in, the tiny waiting area was packed, and we felt like we found a 'hidden gem'.  We got there at 7:30 on a Saturday night and there was about a  1/2 hour wait -- but worth it.    Super-fresh fish.  Many of their daily specials are simply based on what they found that looked good at the fish market that morning.  Pricing was actually a little less than we are used to paying in Our 'go to' spot in Vegas.  Regular rolls around $9-10 and specials rolls around $14-15.  Definitely will return when back in town!",

    "text": "Hiro sushi is hands down one of the best places in Arizona to get sashimi and sushi of high quality. Their fish is always fresh and cut well. They are the only sushi place I've ever been able to order jellyfish, which is excellent. Their toro is amazing. They also have less expensive sashimi lunch specials which are great quick options if you're not looking to spend more on a full sushi or sashimi meal. They also serve one of the best sunomono salads I've ever had. I also recommend trying the sauteed mushrooms as well.   Atmosphere - Cozy and dim lit, the sushi bar dominates the space in the best way. Small tables fill the rest of the restaurant and a small waiting area as you walk in with a wall filled with celebrity photos. Their staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. This is my go to spot for sushi any time day or night. It is an environment that allows you to be a bit more casual which I like.",

Sushi rice was too soft/mushy and all the rolls consist of either eel sauce or shrimp tempura. Not a big variety of rolls and DO NOT GET THE DYNAMITE APPETIZER. it is a waste of $10. It was literally a bowl of baked mayonnaise and tiny scalllops with imitation crab.(crap) Not even anything to dip into the bowl to pick it up with.

They always accommodate my absurd requests: Sashimi Dinner, No rice, Double salad, Dressing on the side. I hate myself for that order, but they don't judge, and that makes me happy. The sashimi is amazing. Another reviewer commented on the sushi being cut poorly (jagged edges). I'm no Sushi master, but I did pass first grade, can color in the lines, and cut out shapes. I never noticed these jagged edges, AND I'M A REGULAR (literally considering mercury poisoning just to be the duchess of this place.) One more comment, and then I'll move on, who cares if the edges aren't perfect - the taste is amaze, and that's what really matters, I think.  So things I swear by: Sashimi dinner, obviously. The mushroom special from the specials board... cooked with.... what's it called.. dang it, well they're amazing, and the sauce is amazing. PONZU? I think. Big fan. My mom always orders the tempura, and it's delightful as well.",

The YELLOWTAIL nigiri melts in your mouth and is by far the best yellowtail I have EVER had. We also tried the spicy octopus which was also perfectly flavored and not too spicy; the texture was spot on.   Walking up to the restaurant it looked a little \"sketchy\" but the moment you walk in the door the restaurant is booming with people and you are kindly greeted by the hostess and sushi chefs. The sushi chefs have a sense of humor, and I rarely sit at the sushi bar, but we did, and it was worth it! They are skilled, and constantly laughing and cheerful as they prepare your food.   I will be returning! I would suggest calling ahead. It is a small restaurant and I think the secret is out (at least on yelp) of how good this place its.",

Okinawa soba - Loved this noodle soup dish so much. Great broth, not too salty, which delicious noodles and fall of the bone spare ribs. Excellent.  Toro nigiri - Super fatty and buttery  Sashimi sampler - I usually wouldn't order this, but my parents don't eat much nigiri and rarely eat rolls, so they ordered it. Everything tasted super fresh though.  I had ordered one of their special rolls, but the name escapes me now. I think it had spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, and something else...anyways, it was pretty good.  Service is great and the prices were pretty reasonable. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but good value. If my parents are still going here by the time I return next year, then this place is a keeper.  Go early for dinner. We went shortly after opening and were the first people in the restaurant. By six, there were only two small tables open.",

    "text": "I was never very adventurous when it came to food. Even when I was a high school student studying Japanese, I was always too afraid to even try sushi. Thank goodness a woman with a more sophisticated palate than my own came along to show me the error of my ways!  Tucked away in a little shopping center off of 90th in Scottsdale, Hiro is another one of the many great places around town that you'd miss if you weren't actually looking for it...so pay attention!  Hiro Sushi is only open for lunch and dinner. I know...of course it's not open for breakfast...but between lunch and dinner the restaurant actually closes down. So, be sure and pay attention to the hours of operation, as you might miss your opportunity to enjoy awesome place!  Having been to a few different sushi places to date, I would have to say that that Hiro is my favorite. At some places, they have a conveyor belt that brings different dishes around for you to enjoy. Although I do enjoy those places as well, Hiro has a more traditional Japanese feel to it. It's more authentic than gimmicky.   Since we were with our daughter, we ended up sitting at a table. While we were waiting for our food, I noticed that there was a sushi bar where you could sit and see all of the different foods. I also noticed that the sushi chefs were very chatty and involved with the patrons seated in front of them. Next time, I think we'll find a sitter for a little while...THAT would be the full Japanese experience.  The menu itself is pretty extensive. They have \"Fill-in-the-Blank\" Rolls of all different types. So, if you're a veteran to the different styles of sushi or if you're a rookie who is looking to safely expand their horizons a little bit, the menu will undoubtedly have something you'll enjoy.  The location itself is actually kind of small inside. The tables are pretty close together, so if you happen to be there while other people are eating, it's almost as if you were having lunch/dinner with them. That's the only negative thing I could find about this place, because the food and the service were awesome!",

Every time we go there we get the calamari appetizer which is just lightly breaded just enough to give the tentacles a little crunch but not overdone, and the drizzle of ponzu sauce is perfect!  Their d-back roll is LOADED with crab and shrimp and the Sedona roll, when ordered with the house made hot sauce is incredible.  Their service is prompt and attentive by a warm, welcoming family run staff, but get there early if you plan to eat a lot. A \"Scottsdale bar scene\" this is not....think more \"small family run restaurant\".  When closing time comes they mean it! It is amazing how that place clears out.  You'll enjoy every piece though!",

There are a lot of sushi places,  but this one has Toro (blue-fin tuna) when in season.  Most places out here wont buy it because they cant sell enough of it to make it worthwhile.  All those in the \"sushi know\" eat at Hiro.  Hiro is from Japan and has brought his local knowledge to our little corner of Scottsdale.  If you have to impress an out of towner, perhaps from California, take them here.  They'll realize you don't have to live on a coast to get fresh fish.  I have never had a bad meal.  Go be impressed, worth the wait.",

    "text": "My coworker and I hit Hiro's for lunch the other day, and I'm so glad I did!   First off, this place isn't what I'd call inexpensive. Be prepared to drop at least $15, just for lunch. But it's worth it!  The vibe is very much like a legit sushi house in the middle of Tokyo, with everyone behind the counter and the main server being Japanese. It's definitely up there in terms of authenticity.  I have to admit, my initial impression was a little eehhhh... As soon as I walked in the door I was hit with a smell that was reminiscent of a fresh fish market. It threw me off, and I was a little worried about the quality of the fish because of it.   I needn't have worried.  The smell abated as soon as I stepped into the restaurant proper, and the seafood was ridiculously fresh. In fact, as we sat at the sushi bar we were able to watch one of the chefs butcher a yellow tail, and I don't think I've seen a fresher fish in Arizona.  As for the food, it was excellent! I got a spicy yellow tail roll and a Sesame roll, which is essentially a spider roll with a sesame soy wrapper instead of nori. The yellow tail was fresh and refreshing, with big chunks of avocado (I subbed it for the cucumber). The sesame roll was flavourful, with a ridiculous amount of soft shell crab.   My coworker got the chicken teriaki don and a roll... I don't remember which one. But the portion for the don was more than ample for lunch. Both items were so good, she cleaned both plates.   The service is excellent!  I'll definitely be back to try more of their rolls and their unagi don.",

We arrived right at 5pm on a Saturday (without a reservation) and were quickly seated at the sushi bar. In other restaurants, this would have bothered me, but the chefs here are friendly and entertaining. The selection is wonderful, and I highly recommend whatever the fresh catch or special roll of the day is. I promise you, IT WILL BE GREAT. As mentioned, the service is exceptional. Our water glasses were never less than half full. Drink recommendations were more than helpful. And there was nothing we ordered that was not absolutely amazing. Hiro Sushi is a favorite for sure!",

This place has all the hallmarks of a great Sushi restaurant: An army of chefs, an extensive (and expensive) menu, reservations needed for a table, people waiting 20 minutes for a seat at the bar. But the fish itself is actually very mediocre! I ordered the sushi assortment for $21 and most of the pieces were flavorless. I've actually had supermarket sushi at Fry's that tasted better than this!!! My experience eating the finest sushi in New York City and the upscale suburbs of NJ has been that the fish explodes with flavor on your tongue and practically melts in your mouth. Not here. This place is way overpriced for what it is and it left me quite angry",

    "text": "The negative reviews about this place should be disregarded. The ones I've read are all written by people who seem to know little about Japanese food, like not to get a deep-fried dish for takeout, what the names of things they ate are...   Hiro is world class, period. I was a NYer for 15 years, ate at several of the best places there. I've traveled to Tokyo several times, and around Japan. I had the best sushi in Honolulu at Sasabune. Hiro holds its own with any of them. Not every thing on the menu is special, True. Which is why my wife and I tend to go there when we want to splurge and get the omakase. The chefs bring out their very best stuff, and you don't know what it'll be. It's usually the best meal of the year.   We went for our third omakase meal there last night, and it was wonderful again. All the fish was exemplary, starting with the red snapper, o-toro, and yellowtail sashimi. Absolutely top quality. We also had a dish of sauteed mushrooms and grilled black cod, both of which were outstanding. There was what they call the crazy roll (delicious) and the spicy ribbon roll (also terrific.) There was the butterfish sashimi served with the fish's deep-fried skeleton. All of it wonderful. Ate every bone and morsel. Then came the nigiri, which included a wasabi octopus specialty, and frankly the only octopus sushi I've ever enjoyed. The salmon was sublime, the bluefin and albacore tuna wonderfully contrasting and delicious.   The service was very good, and we felt like two very lucky people, having one of the best meals possible. Bill for this extravagant spread came to just over $200 for the two of us, including two large beers and two glasses of wine. The same meal at Sasabune cost us $330, and wasn't really better.   If you go and want to order a special treat, try the kiwi salmon. It's a blend of raw salmon, salmon roe, and kiwi seeds. The whole thing works brilliantly, and was invented by Chef Hiro. Memorable. Go, and get the good stuff. You will not be disappointed. Unless you don't know about Japanese food.",

Now that I have been there, I do highly recommend a reservation for the weekends even if it is just two people!   We luckily got seated pretty quick at a table. There are more seats at the sushi bar than tables.  Our server was very sweet and smiled, which I always appreciate.  My mom and I ordered a few rolls and some sashimi. The rolls were decent. I think you can always tell the quality of a place by the sashimi and the sashimi here was WONDERFUL. I would go here in a heartbeat if I was craving some fresh fish.

    "text": "One of the few sushi places in Arizona I've gone to that I couldn't stop thinking about for hours afterwards (and the next day!). And that includes the long drive home from Phoenix to Tucson. I found this place after yelping it and boy were Yelpers spot on.  I don't know if it's on the menu but we got the \"Chef special.\" Pretty much it consisted of us asking the sushi chef what's good there and he said he'll take care of us. If I have time, I'll post pictures but we received a whole array of fresh fish (nigiri, roll, and sashimi), including monkfish pate, and they were all amazing. I think the stars of the night were the Spanish Mackerel (tasted like a fatty Salmon) and the Toro, but honestly, you can't go wrong with any of them.   Bill was about $50/person but we didn't order any drinks. I think it's totally worth the price though.  P.S. I guess there was another dish that wasn't on the menu called the \"lollipop.\" The patrons next to us got it and it looked delicious. We were too stuffed to order one at that point but in the future I'll be sure to try it. Also, it may help to call in reservations. We went on Sunday night at around 7pm and they were still packed.",

I've been to many sushi spot all over US and it's by far the best I've ever had!! I'll give them 20 stars if I can.  I drive like 30 minutes plus to just eat their sushi. It's kinda far but definitely worth it!!",

    "text": "I wish there were 10 stars available for this place.  I started coming here about 10 years ago with the office crowd and I had never tried sushi before.  Now I am a firm fan of this small neighborhood place.  I have now tried sushi in many different restaurants in different cities and countries, but they don't stack up against this place.  I love their spicy octopus, stuffy crunchy shrimp (a house special) and their tempura is light and tasty.  They also offer an out if this world eggplant miso which I would gladly drink pints of that sauce it is so good!  I am also a big fan of their Okinawa soup, a meal in the bowl with soba noodles, broth, slices of fish cake, shredded ginger and spring onion - a real treat.  They offer a chirashi dish which is served in a lacquered box and consists of a bed of rice with slices of fresh sashimi which is always good.  If I don't have that then we have fun with the maki / sashimi menu options ordering their excellent spicy tuna (they roll it in sesame seeds which really make it pop), tuna tempura sashimi (which comes with that wonderful miso sauce), their spicy ribbon roll is good and we love their scallop maki as well as their flying fish eggs, spicy salmon and yellow tail.    If you do want to eat here at night you should consider booking a table or waiting till a seat at the counter opens up.  If you don't mind the counter, sitting there is where you get to witness the wonderful knife skills of the friendly chefs, some of which are the sons on the owner Hiro.    I love this place, hope you do too, enjoy.........",

    "text": "As a spoiled sushi brat (spent 3 months in Japan last year), I have to give this place credit.  There are gaps to perfection here, but by and large this place has excellent quality offerings across a variety of courses (check out the hamachi kama), and some very high quality fish.  I was sad to learn that they didn't have any uni or otoro (did have chutoro that was decent, but nothing amazing) the night I was there, but based on the sake (salmon), hamachi, tai with yuzu garnish, and a couple rolls I have to say that their fish is excellent.  The atmosphere was also refreshing as the wait staff and the chefs actually converse in Japanese which lends itself to an ambiance that felt a lot closer to places like Osaka and Kyoto than many of the coastal city restaurants I've frequented.  In a way I feel bad for knocking off a star, but that really is a reflection of it vs. global eateries rather than the standard US faire.  If you're in the Scottsdale area and you are looking for good quality sushi and an atmosphere to match I have to say this has been my favorite place so far.",

Even at 9:00pm the place was packed, but we got lucky enough to be seated at the counter right in front of the sushi chefs. I've never had sushi made directly in front of me before so it was quite an enjoyable experience.  I was there with my boyfriend, and between us we got a caterpillar roll (eel), a spider roll (soft shell crab), a shrimp tempura roll, a lobster roll, a tuna roll, some edamame, yellowfin nagiri, tuna and salmon sashimi, and some mochi for dessert. Everything tastes great, and the staff were very friendly. My only complaint is that occasionally we had to remind the chefs that we were missing a roll or two, but it was understandable with how busy it was, and afterwards they were quick to get us our food. It was a bit pricey, though most sushi is, but we'll definitely be back!",

So many options to choose from but we especially liked the crazy roll, sammy roll, crispy spicy tuna roll, California roll and the freshwater eel.

The host was very nice and got the table set up for a family of four. The waitress wasn't happy to see kids at the table. She was noticeably discontent with the four of us. We rushed through dinner to give her table back for the next guests. The food was fair, but nothing special. It left us wondering why the place was as highly rated as it is, but everyone has \"off nights\". This might have been one of them.",

    "text": "Came to this place based off recommendations from coworkers and creeping on a local (Phoenix) friends yelp page. I was lookin' for sushi! But in the Wild West? Doubtful I'll find any worth writing about...   WRONG!   Walked in and it's packed! Good sign, as there's another all you can eat sushi place within walking distance. So obviously this place is worth it. But what's this? A minimum of 40 minute wait? Dude, I'm hungry and again, expectations are low. Fresh fish prepared properly in the middle of the desert? Yea right.... again: WRONG!  Sit down at the bar, and a delightful woman attends to me.... speaks Japanese, is Japanese. But what's this? Get to talking and come to find out, she's from Okinawa!!! Itoman to be exact. Those of y'all that know me know I lived in Okinawa for 6 yrs. And I'm very familiar with her hometown. Then she turns to the gentlemen that is referred to as , the main and obviously head sushi chef, and tells him hey this guys from Okinawa! Well go figure, he's her husband, and guess where she's from? Yea. So not only does this Japanese restaurant have actual Japanese people preparing the dishes, but they are fellow islanders, what a cool surprise. And I'm not being prejudice or anything, but don't you get excited when you walk into an Italian joint and find that it's actually owned and operated (and the cooks) by actual Italians?!? Yea, well I like sushi places to have sushi chefs that are actually from Japan! Anyways...   The menu is full of everything from rolls to nigiri and sashimi! But there's hidden gems there, mainly, OKINAWA SOBA! Yuuuup! I ordered it, and it's REAL! Just like Hamaya Soba in sunabe! Go figure, with actual Okinawans working the joint. And, for those of you that drink (I do NOT and did not) they have Orion! Yup, the only Japanese beer exclusively made and owned and operated on the tiny island of Okinawa. What a rare find that was.   The lady and the man talked the entire night and you could tell they were thrilled to have someone come in that knows there homeland. They were both so friendly and so delightful. Very much like the people of itoman, the area they are from.   The sushi was AMAZING! I ordered 4 pieces of nigiri and 2 rolls along with my soba. Before I was done I had to order another 6 pieces of nigiri. It was that good. But be warned, if you come to eat like I did, bring your wallet. Now I'm not saying it's overly expensive, in fact I found it relatively fair priced. But as you already know, good sushi, real sushi, isn't a fast food cheap meal. Please understand that. Your paying for quality, freshness, presentation and all that, and that's what you'll get here, along with good conversation.   If you're with a group, grab the tables. But if you're in a party of 3 or less, sit at the bar and talk and interact with the expert gentlemen that are preparing your dishes right in front of you.   This place is a for real 5 star joint. I will absolutely go back anytime I'm in the Phoenix area. And if you are in the Phoenix area, make a reservation and go check this place out. You will not be disappointed.   Dat sushi mayne!",

You see, Hiro Sushi reminds me so much of those old style Japanese sushi places from the past.    No, it doesn't have a conveyor belt.  Nor does it have any of those fancy, wiz bang modern features that you find in so many Valley sushi places. No huge caldrons of fire keeping watch over it's entrance. LOL  It fact Hiro's entrance is very unassuming. If you driven along 90th Street regularly, you probably past it many times, not realizing it was there.  The California Rolls are delicious, as are the tuna sushi. In fact everything is great. Five Stars. Expect to pay around $25-ish depending how thirsty and hungry you are.   Enjoy!",

Forget about all the other fancy, trendy, expensive sushi restaurants in the valley. This is where it's at.  I've had the spicy salmon roll, spicy yellowtail, las vegas and a salmon skin hand roll. The rice is cooked perfectly and as previously mentioned, the fish is always fresh. My boyfriend always orders the chef's choice (Omakase I believe?). For appetizers, I always order the seaweed salad and squid salad. Their calamari is honestly my favorite calamari ever. It is cut into tiny pieces and breaded, and comes in a bowl with green onions and ponzu sauce. Absolutely delicious. You can't go wrong with the hamachi kama as well as one of their potato string wrapped shrimp appetizers.   All of my foodie friends and I always rave about how amazing Hiro Sushi is. If you are a sushi snob like myself, there is absolutely no doubt that Hiro would be your favorite as well.",

The tempura was to die for. I was sad to finish eating it. My boyfriend loved his sushi as well (he got blue fin negi toro and the spicy yellow tail), which he described as \"very rich and savory\".

    "text": "I'm so glad we decided to try Hiro Sushi! For the past few years I've been very disappointed in Phoenix-area sushi restaurants. Hiro isn't just good for the area; it compares well to restaurants in other cities, too.  Hiro is a small, quiet restaurant done up in dark, sophisticated colors. Even when the restaurant was full, the atmosphere was relaxing. There were a few families there, but it would still be a good place for a date.   I'm incredibly picky about the freshness of fish, most of all when I'm eating it raw, and I've passed this on to my family. If you feel the same way, you'll be happy to learn that none of us had any complaints in this area.  Hiro's portions are large, which is great if you love shashimi. In fact, my favorite item was the salmon sashimi. Hiro had some truly beautiful salmon last night, and it tasted even better than it looked! The tuna sashimi was also served generously and it was very good.   The nigiri items we ordered were ikura (salmon eggs), ika (squid), suzuki (bass) and unagi (eel.) The suzuki is usually prepared with ponzu (a cirtus vinegar) but you can get it without. Unagi is usually barbequed, but they offered it to my husband in two different ways. I can't remember what the other way was, but he ordered the barbequed, and he and my daughter said it was delicious. (I could taste that one because it wasn't gluten-free; same with the ikura, which my daughter, the ikura fan, said were good.) I'm the squid fan, and since you see I've given Hiro five stars, you know I enjoyed their squid!  I'd like to make special note about the edamame. At most restaurants this popular appetizer is treated with the same care as the free chips you get at a cheap Mexican joint. There's a lot of overcooked edamame in this town! At Hiro, ALL of the edamame in our three large bowls were bright and crispy. You didn't see salt on the outside of the pods, but they must have seasoned them in some way, because the peas inside were mildly salty and seemed to have some other flavors, too.   Hiro takes reservations, and on the weekends you should make one. We went early on a Saturday (6pm) and wanted to sit at the sushi bar, so we were okay, but all the tables were already reserved, and within a half hour of our arrival all the tables were filled, and the sushi bar, too.  We'll definitely be back!  UPDATE JULY 2015: We HAVE been back to Hiro Sushi, and it's always been great.",

For those of you who are also on the quest to find authentic Japanese restaurants in the US, go to Hiro's if you find yourself in the area.  From the initial, \"Irrashai!\" As we walked in, the experience was like being in a little sushi joint in Japan.  My companion noted several times how great the service was and I have to agree.  I was excited to see Okinawa Soba on the menu so gave that a shot along with Otoro, salmon, Hamachi and Kani.   Ok, so the Toro did not need to be chewed it merely melted...heaven.  The last time I had Okinawa Soba was in Japan and this was the real deal even to include the hot pepper infused Awamori (ok, it was actually Vodka, but tasted the same). Our waitress had just moved here from Okinawa three years ago.   We had a Japanese rice beer... An import that was very good.   Sooo, this was overall an excellent experience and I'm glad we found it",

    "text": "Found Hiro Sushi from great reviews on yelp. Was able to be seated immediately for lunch on a Wednesday. Party of 4, staff was very friendly and cordial, ordered drinks, no liquor available- just beer and water wine, no big deal. Edamame to start, spicy tuna rolls, spicy salmon rolls, California roll with real crab ordered. Spicy Tuna Don and tempura shrimp roll. All was quite good, miso soup and salad tasty, quick turn for sushi and other dishes. Spicy Tuna roll was rough chopped pieces of tuna not macerated style (we prefer the rough chopped pieces). Quaint old school atmosphere, mild fish smell, but not over powering like some established facilities of similar age. Not for the person seeking the trendy approach. Highly recommend",

Most of my friends did have sushi and they all enjoyed their meals. One friend had the fried oyster dinner and she really liked it. A lot of food on her plate!  Another friend actually tried the quail eggs and the octopus!!!  She kind of liked them. I give her an \"A\" for experimenting. I want to bring my daughter and her boyfriend here because they both love sushi.",

Do add the ginger and onions a atop if the lightness is to bland for you. The crazy roll was decent and basic. No mayo or sauce or extra flavoring added. I didn't try their fancier rolls because it costs like $15.95 or $14.95...which i think is over the top for one roll...  I'd come here again but only if i was in the neighborhood...",

She was in such a rush, didn't care to have any conversation with us, checked on us once and didn't refill our drinks once. She had an attitude when we were ordering and made everyone feel so uncomfortable and rushed, nope unacceptable. Just an unsatisfying experience at this restaurant, there were reviews from yesterday that said the server was rude, he wasn't lying.  Also, it's 18% added gratuity for parties 6 or more.   Did she deserve 18%? Hell to the no. More like 5%.  If you want excellent service & excellent food, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  That is all. Cheers!",

We were driving from Flag back to our hotel in Phoenix and reached out to Yelp and this paid off big time. We were directed through the darkness of Scottsdale, to a very non-descript place and there is was: the friendly facade of Hiro Sushi.   We had the usual: miso, salad, rolls, and tempura. The quality was without doubt, and the service was without flaw. The welcoming interior made us feel right at home, with a desire to linger long after the meal was done. There were other patrons enjoying the experience in the same way we were. I can't wait to go back.",

The cuts aren't perfect, like they are in other places, but they are thick and of such high quality you just don't care!  The specials change based on what's fresh.  The chefs are friendly and excellent at what they do.  The servers are kind, and attentive.  I was able to get types of sushi (as well as sake and beer) that I haven't been able to find elsewhere! (at least not in the states) The waits can be long because of the high volume of people and the tiny dinning area, but they do take reservations.  I almost hate to give such a glowing review because the more people, the bigger the line! But... I must, because it's just too good! If you're a sushi novice and wanting to try for the first time - this is your place! If you're a sushi aficionado, and just like what you like, but want it better - this is your place! If you're a sushi expert and wanting what you can't find elsewhere - this is your place!  You won't be disappointed!",

The Gyoza was tasty and delicious and made fresh there on the premises!  Ended the meal with some strawberry and chocolate mochi! Yum!  Friendly and warm staff.  There is just nothing to complain about here.  They nail it on all counts!",

It was very authentic Japanese and the sushi was incredible.  Extremely fresh, melt in your mouth, sushi.  And great service.  The place was bustling and the sushi chefs, Hiro included, seemed to know all the regulars!  Definitely a place to try if you are visiting and a place to frequent if you live in the area.",

The rolls did fall apart a little and could have been packed tithgter but the overall quality was terrific and the price was good.",

To top it off, Leo did an awesome fruit carved rickshaw and served it to me with ice cream to make my night special.  Ill definitely go back again!",

I was not a fan of the chain sushi restaurants so many people rave about and frequent. I rate my sushi bars by the quality and the interest level of the food and not their creative roll names or multiple uses for mayo and imitation crab. Hiro sushi has put my sushi yearning heart to rest. The fish is fresh. The specials board is full of really interesting and different options. We encountered multiple people who frequent the place on a weekly basis and they informed us that the boards are always changing and they have never been disappointed. All in all I walked out of there full and excited that I was not going to have to drive to the coast for my fix!",

It was ok I guess if you don't know any better or if you were expecting more like I did. I ordered the more expensive stuff like giant clam, toro, and unagi. I also had a crunchy roll which was only mediocre. The tempura in it was cold and spicy tuna wasnt much or spicy and rice was soft and mushy. The toro tasted very frozen and only ok.  I would search again next time for another place. I will be out there again soon.",

    "text": "I'll sum this place up in one word -\"hamachi-kama\". Or is it two. I don't know for sure, my Japanese is very limited. What I do know is that it is without a doubt one of the best things that I've had there. For those of you that don't know, it's charcoal grilled yellowfin collar. The collar is the part of the fish just behind the gills and forward of the pectoral fins and is one of the most neglected part of the fish, at least here in the States. Ours came grilled to perfection, crunchy on the outside, silky soft and delicious inside. Another high point was mackerel 3 ways- two marinated pieces of nigiri sushi, as a carpaccio salad, and then finally the skeleton coated in rice flour and deep fried as a bone cracker.  I could go on, but words can't do it justice. To find out for yourself just how good this place is, walk in, ask to be seated at the bar, and ask your \"Itamae\" (sushi chef) \"Omakase onegaishimasu\". The phrase means \"Please astonish me\" or \"Please give me your best\". It puts you in the chefs hands and he will bring you the best he has to offer, often times not even on the menu.  To accompany your dinner, ask for one of the cold, unfiltered saki's. Subtle and so much better than that heated swill that people drop in their Sapporo.",
