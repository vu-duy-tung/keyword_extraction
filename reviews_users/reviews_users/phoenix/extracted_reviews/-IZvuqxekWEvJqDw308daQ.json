They keep the place clean, they are always kind, and they work with all kinds of requests. I highly recommend deep frying or getting an enchilada (wet) style burrito with green sauce. Best casual sonoran mexican restaurant in the Tempe area by far.",

Yummmm does not begin to describe the food. 10x that of any ____bertos. I mean that. (Sorry Julio).  They even put french fries inside Dallas G's burrito. I have never seen him so happy. Ever.  Plus, when I said I was vegan and gf the chick said, well, get a bean taco! Do you know how long it usually takes to explain to someone that I just want a bean taco. No meat. No cheese. Just a bean taco. That's right. Just beans. So major kudos to her for grasping the concept that there are freaks like me in the world who don't eat animal products.  I used to eat their breakfast burritos as well. Their potatoes are fabulous.  Stop what you are doing and go now.",

Waited not too long and I got my order. Once I got home and started eating, I realized that I didn't think that I had been there before because it's pretty forgettable. Maybe I'm not getting the right thing? But I can think of a few places that are better for the price.",

No time to cook before school can only mean limp boring toast or cereal. I'd rather skip straight to the coffee.  When I have time to make something, breakfast burritos are at the top of my list! I'm a pretty good cook, but nothing I could ever make would compare to Favoritos.  I used to order the ham&cheese burrito and have since mixed in the chorizo burrito. They are great! Filled with eggs, meat, potatoes, onions and a great blend of spices all wrapped up in a doughy tortilla.  They also will give me as much hot sauce as I need, which is usually a couple tubs.   I would go far more often if I lived closer! I still pretend I am a regular.",

Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!",

The portion is very large, they use shredded cheese (not nacho cheese sauce), and the ground beef is seasoned, though it's a bit chewy/fatty with some gristle occasionally.  The fries were hot and crispy.  Dining companion got the chimichanga combo and said it was good.  I've only been to the Chandler location before, so it's good to know this Tempe location is okay too.  The atmosphere is pretty nonexistent, and there aren't even any booths (but there are a claw machine, Pac-Man, and sticker coin machines) but that's okay.  The food is what's important!  I did notice that the prices are much higher than I remember the prices the Chandler one had a few years ago.  Stomach was a little \"ugh, that was greasy\" feeling after, but could've been much worse.  Debating between two and three stars and going to go with three for their hours and order accuracy (I've had to get my order redone multiple times at Los Tacquitos so I was very happy it was correct the first time here).",

I can barely finish a whole burrito and often have a little bit left over. Don't forget to try their sauces! The red sauce is definitely my favorite out of the two because it has more kick to it.

I used to go to the one in Gilbert all the time when I lived/worked out there and was happy to find this location when I moved to Tempe, but the past 2-3 times I've gone I've been really let down.  Like other reviewers have noted, the staff here is far from friendly, but that doesn't play a role in my review.  The food always outweighs the service in a place like this, but my bacon breakfast burrito I ordered this morning had about 90% potatoes and was super greasy.  If it was my first time going there I would never give them another chance.  Having said that, after being let down the past few times I doubt I'm going to go back.  Maybe they changed cooks in the back or something but the food is nowhere near as good as it used to be",

For ~$9, it comes with meat, Mexican rice, cheese, pinto beans, and some guacamole that is not all that bad.  I chose Pollo Asada for my Jumbo Burrito and wasn't all impressed with it.  The chicken wasn't that flavorful, and even though I hadn't eaten a full meal all day I was only able to finish barely half of it.  I planned on saving it for the next day, but I ended up not even finishing it because the flavor was so bland.  I would recommend Carne Asada Jumbo Burrito, since a lot of my friends got the that for their Jumbo Burrito and gladly finished it.

All I get is the breakfast burrito w no meat (potato, egg &cheese), so I can't speak to their other menu items.  The breakfast burrito is delicious. Rarely can I go a week without having one. It has the right amount of salt and spices and the tortilla is fresh and slightly flaky.  Prompt, friendly service.",

Just about everything here is the bees knees. 95% of the time i stick with their line of gourmet breakfast burritos. From bacon, to their ham, to even the chorizo, these are some of the better breakfast burritos in the valley. The only issue with faves after about 5 years of venturing here are the burrito sizes (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, COOKS IN THE BACK). Most of the time i'm guaranteed a pretty thick sized burrito, but every once in a while ill come in and pay 5$ for a glorified taquito. That's a no-no when it comes to keeping your burrito savvy customers satisfied... If faves served some infant sized burritos like some of the other places around town, this would be the best taco shop in the land.  Nonetheless if you have never been here, definitely come in and give it a try. Just avoid Saturday mornings, some of the longest waits/lines in burrito eating history have occured at los faves on a Saturday morning. Apparently the local college crowd has the same hungover breakfast burrito urge that i get on these weekend mornings...",

    "text": "I woke up with the largest craving in the world for a green chili burrito. I went to \"Los Fav's\" as we tempe folk call it and conveyed my enthusiasm to the girl at the register.   All I wanted was a green chili burrito, with chicken instead of pork.   Instead, I was given a plain chicken burrito with flavorless mexican rice. I cannot convey the amount of disappointment I felt at that moment. In fact, I was so disappointed, that I threw away the burrito after about three bites and told my roommates that I had just experienced the worst tasting burrito that I have ever had in my life. Then, my roommate suggested dousing the burrito in hot sauce to the point where I could only taste the stinging sensation of the red sauce. I concurred, that just about anything would be better than tasting the poor excuse for food that I had been given but it was too late for that. By this time I had lost my appetite.   I was stuck in some sort of appetite \"limbo-land\" where I had not eaten more than three bites of food, but yet I had no desire to eat anything more. I could not even muster myself to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to try and salvage my sunday morning.  Instead-- I decided to write this review. I wrote this review not to bash the lady at the register for messing up my order, but raise awareness and hopefully to deter others from making the same mistake that I did.  AMERICA.",

The decor in the dining room is pretty hilarious, but all the more character it adds I guess.  My favorite part is the vegetarian options.  Try a veggie burrito with added potatoes (they're not actually just potatoes but more like tiny french fries), put a little red AND green sauce in it, and get ready for heaven.",

Total dive restaurant, but usually I have found, the dive restaurants usually have some of the best food. I have come here for breakfast now many times, their burritos are huge and flavorful. My only gripe is they use french fries for the potatoes in the burritos. If they made their own home fries in the burrito, I would dub them the perfect breakfast burrito. I have yet to try the lunch/dinner entrees, maybe one day!",

    "text": "My experience at Los Favoritos Taco Shop was a positive one. Normally I try to stay away from small sized Mexican restaurants because the food usually isn't all that great and a little on the greasy side. Places such as Filiberto's or any other restaurant in Phoenix ending in \"Berto's\" are usually the restaurants I avoid because of how my stomach feels after eating one of their burritos.   I was craving a breakfast burrito one Saturday morning and I decided to use Yelp to search for a restaurant in my area. The first restaurant that showed up was Los Favoritos so I decided to give it a try seeing how the numerous reviews gave the restaurant a good rating. My favorite burrito to order at any kind of Mexican restaurant is a good old fashioned breakfast burrito with ham, cheese, and potatoes. So I ordered the ham breakfast burrito which I think at Los Favoritos their specialty is in fact the breakfast burritos, I could be wrong.   The wait was not long at all and I could hardly wait to start eating my burrito when it was handed to me. Of course you have to try both of the sauces, which were your typical red and green. The burrito was sooo good, I've ordered burritos from everywhere around Phoenix and this breakfast burrito was among the best. The burrito was far from greasy, you know when you're eating a greasy burrito when the grease pools down from your hand into the wrapper but this wasn't the case. The ham was moist and chunky, the eggs were, you know, eggs, and the potatoes were crunchy. They reminded me of hash browns which I thought was really good because it gave the burrito a different texture. The sauces made the burrito even more tasty and moist but they weren't as spicy as I'd like them to be.   Overall, I give Los Favoritos Taco Shop 4 stars out of 5. The next time I go I'll make sure to order something different than a breakfast burrito. But this place does not disappoint if you're looking for inexpensive, Mexican fast food.",

Only the ends seem to ever be crispy at any Valley taco shop. The middle remains a soft mushy mess of frustration time and time again. After I eat your lousy rolled tacos, I can never go back because if you can't accomplish that feat, then the rest of your food will likely fall in line. The six rolled taco combo was also kinda cheap-ass. They only put guac on the things, no sour cream, lettuce or anything. Let's also throw in the fact that you must pay for the hot carrots and your lack of a salsa bar is ignorant in 2013. Oh, yeah, the cheese quesadilla was the only redeeming item I purchased. After four green beers, usually most Mexican food tastes good, but this meal was a glaring exception.",

It's just a waste of money honestly. The only reason I still come here is because the chorizo isn't as greasy as most other places but if I'm craving carne Asada I go to the carniceria down the street and pay the same price for a burrito literally quadruple the size. Very disappointed in this location. If you can go somewhere else.",

I was all sad I only got 2 salsas with my chorizo burrito, but that was the perfect amount because you don't need to drench your food in hot sauce like you will most places. Definitely better than Filiberto's or a lot of other small taco shops. I've worked my through most of their menu at this point.  ++Chorizo burrito is excellent, especially when they get the meat/potato/egg ratio perfect  +Their tortillas are amazing +Enchilada sauce is flavorful -Beans are too salty in a bean & cheese burro -Tacos, while delicious, are pretty greasy and the shell often falls apart before you even take a bite  Service isn't always the fastest, but the dude at the counter early in the morning always kills it. The younger girl that works in the morning is super sweet.",

I went to get some sprite/Sierra mist and it was dripping with this mucusy bacteria thing... as my drink is going into the cup the soda is running over the dangling piece of bacteria into the cup. I poured out the cup and was about to ask for a refund for the drink but since it took a while I just decided to leave. Super grossed out that they dont properly clean the drink nozzles, and I'd be careful getting a beverage from there. For something to form like that... it must've taken at least a week or more.",

    "text": "9/25/2018 Yelp Review Los Favoritos Tacos Shop Tempe AZ Los Favoritos 1340 E Broadway Rd Ste 105 (480) 966-0535  Let me start off by saying that Los Favoritos Tacos Ship is my favorite place to get breakfast. The food is delicious and have never had a problem with a meal. I go at least once a week and never disappointed with what I order. I have ordered the sausage, bacon, and chorizo breakfast burrito and I've also had their supreme burrito for lunch. Both of the sauces are also delicious, but I normally get the green sauce based off preference. They also have the best tortillas that you will ever have. They feel like homemade tortillas and they're filled with the perfect proportion of meat, eggs, and potatoes. The kitchen is in the back of the shop, so I can't watch the food being bad, but I always know that it is going to come out amazing.   Right when you walk in you are greeted with friendly service and you can hear the workers singing Spanish music in the back. The food is always cooked to order and is extremely quick. Some days I could walk in and out in 5 minutes and 10 if it is really crowded. They definitely have one of the best staffs I have experienced.  I normally get take out, but there have been a few times that I did sit in to enjoy my food. It can be a little unclean and messy, but that never bothers me. All of the seating options are booths which is always a plus. The bathrooms weren't bad either and didn't feel grossed out like some other places. They have cool walls and extremely vibrant colors and Spanish music playing throughout the restaurant.   Now to the main aspect of the restaurant. THE PRICES! There is almost nothing on the menu that is over 10 dollars and the breakfast burritos come out to be $5.90 including tax. This is by far the cheapest, best tasting, and highest quality burrito I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The burritos always fill me up and I don't have to break the bank to enjoy a delicious breakfast. As a struggling, jobless college student, it is always an amazing treat to find a place with good food and low prices. They also sell Horchata and 2 other Mexican style drinks that you can order for less than 3 dollars for a large. Personally, I don't like these Mexican style drinks, but friends that enjoy this style of drink says it is amazing. If you aren't feeling like getting breakfast than I highly recommend their enchilada style (Supreme) burrito. It is one of their costlier items and it is still under 10 dollars.   Therefore, I give Los Favoritos Tacos Shop a highly deserved 5 out of 5. I recommend that anyone that likes Mexican food, try this place immediately, especially if you're a nearby college student looking for cheap substitutes to a daily breakfast. You will not find a place that has better tortillas than this place. [517 wds.]",

Lately, though, things have been going downhill. Last night, my tacos barely had any meat in them, and everything was over salted. The beans were especially, inhumanely over salted. I mean, to the point where they were inedible. My request for \"no cheese\" is usually not a problem, but on this occasion, my chicken taco had cheese kind of hidden between the meat and lettuce. It was a very disappointing experience. Since I had ordered to-go, I couldn't really get this corrected. They've recently remodeled the dining room with nice looking booths, so I suggest trying this place, and I will again, but eat in so you can have them fix anything that might come out wrong.",

To really take full advantage of their amazing tortillas I'd either order a burrito or their special combos which comes with a warm tortilla.   Go for the meat in the burritos. We ordered a fish, which was delicious, but it was a bit more breading than I wanted. Unfortunately, they were out of the adobada, so we ordered the carnitas taco instead. This was a good choice on our part. Very fresh and meaty. Much better than the fish. I wish we ordered this as a burrito instead of the taco.  For the combination plate, I tried the #8 chorizo plate. The mixture of eggs and potatoes was delicious, but there wasn't much chorizo. The tortilla that comes with the combo is even more delicious than the one they use to wrap the burrito, probably because they warm it up for you. I can't get over how QQ that tortilla was.  If I lived here, would definitely frequent this place often for lunch. And everything is so cheap and in large quantities!",

It seems there is one employee specifically that for the last 13 times I've been there, has \"forgot\" to put my order in. That's providing you call for 2 hours before someone decides to answer and place a pickup order.   I wait an average of 15 minutes every time once there even after they tell me my order would be ready to pick up at a specific time. Business can get busy so I understand, but every time I've gone there and tried to call in, there are a handful of people or less.   Tonight I decided to wait 25 minutes after I called to show up and get my order. Again I sit waiting for another 15 minutes after I've paid and both the customer that ordered a large order in line in front of me got their food, as well as the customers that came in 5 minutes after I showed up and placed an order.   I had asked the cashier there if she forgot my order again (as she has many times before) and she says no, there were orders in front of me.   The orders in front of me were placed almost a half hour AFTER mine and still got their food before I did. The order was simple. 2 bean burritos and a tamale. 45 minutes of waiting with no real line and 3 employees on staff?  Because of tonight I will never visit this location again and I do not recommend you ever plan on calling in orders and getting through, let alone getting them on time.",

One being the red salsa which is not watery like Disgusting Filly B's. Any secondly their carne asada is a whole hell of a lot better most of the time than Filly B's as well. But for Some Bizarre reason this Los Favs doesn't quite make par for me as far as taste tests go compared to the Chandler Location. There is this strong salty taste every time I have had their carne asada fries and I highly doubt they salt their french fries then load on more salty stuff. Then they just kind of dab the sour cream on one side and guacamole on another.  Now I know this sounds like I am just being over critical and picky as can be I am just extremely used to the pizzaz and way of doing things at the other location.  I will be trying their burritos next time so I can see how those turn out, a little nervous but I will give them one more shot.",

The service is always great and you can't beat the prices! I haven't had anything I don't like yet. Both their red and green hot sauce is fantastic! Spicy but not too spicy and they both have great flavor, not a flat chile flavor like some places. They have the best Vegetarian burrito! Simple but oh-so-good! Rice, beans, pico, guac, lettuce all wrapped in a giant tortilla...you can add cheese too! They have fresh tortilla chips for dirt cheap, very good with the hot sauce. 75 cents for a small bag and $1 for a large...yes... that cheap! Good enchiladas, quesadillas, etc...You can get a huge dinner for two for less than $10 and I mean, a lot of food! This is the perfect little taco shop. The kind you can roll out of bed to, in your pjs, after any kind of night and know you're taste buds will be taken care of. Definitely recommend.",

I admit that I'm drooling just a little bit right now as a write this.  If it came with a little rice inside I would have given this place 4 stars.",

    "text": "In spite of the drink cup that says \"I (heart) Los Favoritos\", this was not one of our better finds.  It was Taco Tuesday, and we often venture around the valley looking for gems to satisfy our Mexican food cravings.  We happened to wander by my old haunts with my former Volleyball Team. We used to love the Native New Yorker just across the street from this place. It was a great hangout for us after our weekly Sand Volleyball games.  As I was looking southward reminiscing, my wife looked northward and spotted this place. I was hesitant, but she sounded so convincing. She played my desire to always try something new, and my predilection for trying places off the beaten path.  Los Favoritos is tucked way in the back of a strip mall.  It's not that easy to spot when traveling eastward on Broadway.  Plus, it's definitely not visible when heading westward on the same street. It had a 3.5 star rating on Yelp, and some of my well respected Yelp colleagues rated it quite highly.  What could possibly go wrong with this place?  Let's start with the Tacos.  They were overly deep fried to the point that the shell was so hard to bite through. Since it was overcooked, the meat inside was hard as a beef jerky.  I like beef jerky, but not in my taco!   It was the same with the Taquitos. I'm not sure if they were trying to ensure that everything was well done, thus ensuring no chance of food-borne illness, but this was ridiculous. I could've punctured my tires with these hard Taquitos, seriously!  The street tacos were so salty, and the guacamole didn't not taste fresh at all. It was actually sour, and I'm not talking about some derivative flavor from the sour cream. Maybe it just got left out too long.   Not sure what happened here, but our palates and our stomachs definitely did not agree with anything we tasted. I certainly have to respectfully disagree with my esteemed Yelp friends regarding this place.",

Basically, it's a step above Taco Bell, but not quite a sit down/order off the Menu type place. You're getting (fairly) quality food at a pretty low price (my burrito was $6.50 I believe).   I wasn't THAT crowded when I came in during lunch on a Saturday. There was about 5-6 people in front of me. Orders were taken pretty quick and after I placed mine it took less than 10 minutes for my food to come. There's not a ton of seating (there's one really large booth and then a few smaller ones), but it was fine. After I ordered a long line started to form and the wait for food seemed to get longer.  The burrito was good. Sure, I've had better but it still hit the spot. I ordered a carne asada, and didn't ask what else they put in it, but seemed to be mostly guac & pico (other than the meat). It was a bit dry, but I still devoured it. I got the green sauce with it, which was tasty.  I'd come back if I was in the area.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Tempe from Chandler. The Chandler Los Favs, would get 5 stars from me from mere nostalgia. But also they deserve it. Here are the problems I have found with this location  1. Never answers the phone.  -I like to call my orders in, pick them up and eat them at my house. I would say probably 20% of the time they answer the phone. Sometimes it will just ring endlessly, and I'll have to hang up myself. When they do pick up, it's the most rushed phone call you'll ever be on. Still though, why only 1 out of every 5 calls can they pick up? This leads me to my next point  2. They are INCREDIBLY understaffed.   -I have personally never seen more than three people in that restaurant, usually it's only 2. One cook, and one register. These poor employees get ROCKED when the asu rush hits. Put another register in there and hire some more people. It can't be that hard  3. Salsa/food quality.  -I may be getting finicky at this point, but i am generally disappointed with the lack of flavor and spice that I have become to accustom to. The quality all around the board seems to be only slightly inconsistent, but the salsa has been subpar since the beginning.  I would 100% recommend this place, and I'm feeling that 3 stars might be a little bit harsh. I am a pretty understanding and patient person (who works in the food industry) and have found myself frustrated at these points. Hence the 3 stars. Good luck Los favs I hope you fix some of this stuff!!  Order recommendations  Breakfast burrito  (sausage or bacon? Why not both?)  Carne Asada fries (Huge portion and you'll wanna drench those fuckers in salsa)  Bean and cheese burrito with French fries (A cheaper option, that smacks you with savory goodness. Use the green sauce. refried beans are usually prime, with very limited whole beans, [my preference])  Tacos could not be more average in my opinion, and the enchiladas.... leave those to sit-down restaurants.",

First things first, the woman who helped me at the register was able to accommodate my order request.  I wanted a bean, rice and cheese burro, add shrimp, deep fried.  I am accustomed to most Mexican restaurants having the jalapenos/carrots mixture out and self serve. Not here, $1.50 per bag.  The wait was probably abt 10 mins.  The shrimp tasted really \"fishy\" like no salt/pepper or seasoning was used.  I picked all of the shrimp out of the burrito and they didn't give me any rice.  So I basically had a bean and cheese burrito by the end of it all.  The beans were hard, kind of like they werent warmed all the way or possibly old. This was disappointing especially since the burrito had been fried.    I wont be back.  Not to this location, anyway.",

    "text": "Now don't let my profile picture fool you, I am not, in the traditional sense, a Mexican. Shocking, I know. But, I do know my Mexican food, and Los Favoritos is awesome! Wonderful in fact. Delicious, cheap, clean and delicious.    This morning I got a bacon breakfast burrito with beans inside, and if you don't know, their breakfast burritos are their bread and butter, the money maker, and they never disappoint. The only problem you may ever have is the bacon being a little salty, and even then the always incredible hot sauce (or salsa, whatever) is there to save the day. The carne asada is very good, seasoned well and almost always very tender, the beans, which are cooked with wonderful, wonderful lard, are always just firm enough, never just a pile of mush, never watery, the chicken is juicy and tender, I just can't say enough about it. The only negative I have is that one of the counter girls is a bit rude, and there is a military service recruitment center right next door, so at times you may be bothered a little by them, but come on, they're serving our country, so it can be forgiven.     Los Favoritos is the best fast Mexican restaurant that I have discovered so far. Do yourself a favor and give them a visit, at either location (Tempe, Chandler) and tell them Kevin sent you, they'll probably just look at you funny, but why not?",

Absolutely heaven with every bite accompanied by their green or red hot sauce. Sides that come on the plate also include Mexican rice and refried beans. Both spectacular and delicious!!!!!! Ask for limes too when ordering. Fair prices all around",

For a completely unnecessary reason the cashier was being talked down upon by a unfriendly gentlemen customer. Instead of retaliating, she kindly handled him his refill and went about her workday. This takes a truly amazing person to not give in when others are pushing you. When I stepped up to give me order she was nothing but friendly to me. That alone in my books is enough to keep me coming back time and time again.  Aside from the customer service, the food is always delicious, generously portioned and speedy. I make it a point take all of my out-of-town friends here when they visit. Highly recommend. If I could give more than five stars, I would.",

The chorizo burrito has become a very close ally of mine for too hungover mornings. It saves me every time I eat it. I have a couple times tried other burritos or meals, like the enchiladas and quesadillas and have never been disappointed. Each out of state visitor I have is automatically taken here to experience the spice of real Mexican food. I have never had a visitor do anything less than rave about this place. It is now within walking distance of my apartment, which is a real shame...for my diet. I love Los Faves and if you live in Tempe and haven't tried it out you are really doing yourself a disservice.

I cannot explain it, but they make the most wonderful food. It doesn't taste like every other Mexican food joint; it is legit!!!! The customer service is 100% on game every time.  Some of the top choices include the Carne Asada Fries (you can have them make this into a burrito for you too), vegetarian burrito, super nachos, and they have the BEST cheeseburgers. I don't know what it is, but they are just pure yumminess. You cannot go wrong with any of the breakfast burritos either. I just moved to Oregon and this place is one of things I miss most about AZ. Enjoy!!!!!!",

And, yes, my wife is from D.F. and we travel EXTENSIVELY throughout Mexico (on the economy, not the tourist spots) and after the first two attempts we NEVER ate tacos anywhere in Mexico again because they are NOT AS GOOD AS LOS FAVS.  That's the bottom line.  Every time we return from Mexico we immediately drive directly from the airport to Los Favs for tacos.  As to the other reviews:  what is a \"raw taco?\"  Are you saying they didn't cook the meat they put inside it?  Sorry, but that is not to be believed . . . dipstick.  If the food was cold you should have asked them to put it in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Salsa is \"not good?\"  Why?  Because it's fresh and has no preservatives?  Their salsa is equivalent to/better than some of the best we've found all over Mexico . . . dipstick.  \"Rolled tacos\" are actually \"flautas.\"  So not sure where the nomenclature came from, but I have had them here and they are pretty damn good.  Better than many I've had in el D.F., Michoacan, and Chiapas.  Can't comment about the other menu items because we haven't partaken.  But they appear to be packed to the gills at all hours with people ordering burritos (which, by the way, are NOT Mexican food) so they must be doing something right on that end.  If you want the best tacos in the Valley (better than those we've found in Mexico and in all the other United States of America) go to Los Favs in Tempe!",
