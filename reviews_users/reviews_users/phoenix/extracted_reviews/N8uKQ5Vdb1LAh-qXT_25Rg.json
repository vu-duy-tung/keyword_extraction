Tried their signature butter crust deep dish pizza and honestly it was a let down. Having lived in NY for many years I do have preference for thin crust pizzas but usually I do try local food whenever I travel. I definitely have had better deep dish pizza when I have travelled to Chicago. The original Pizzaria Uno & even the Lou Malnatis in Chicago tastes way better than this pizza.   Was a total let down esp. due to the long wait. I don't think I have had to wait so long in any other restaurant in Phoenix.",

If you get it to go call ahead as the deep dish takes about 30 minutes to make. If you love cheese as I do this pizza will not disappoint there is serious cheese porn happening here.

    "text": "I love the butter crust. The deep dish is what I was raised on in the Chicagoland area. I miss the wine press in the entrance of the one in Elk Grove. The atmosphere at this location is bright and casual.  We had the deep dish sausage peperoni.  The crust is the authentic butter crust that is crunchy and rich in flavor. The sausage is chuncky and quite delicious. The peperoni is peperoni (not a lot to say there). There is heavy tomato sauce over the top of all. For me this is a great thing. There sauce is one of my favorites. (could be San Marzanos, but not sure) The house cabernet was reasonably priced and held up to the pizza just fine. The food and service were perfect. The atmosphere could stand to be more intimate.  The pricing seemed appropriate. If eating there for the first time, the deep dish really is their signature meal. This pizza re-heats very well. Don't be afraid to take some home.",

I'm originally a Chicagoan (born and raised) so going to Lou Malnati's on Lincoln Ave in Lincolnwood while growing up was something my family did every couple of months. But it's been a long while since I've eaten deep dish pizza, and on our recent visit over Labor Day weekend, all my memories of that crust and that sauce came flooding back.   We sat outside, nice mist-ers and cool night breeze. Service was attentive and friendly, wait times weren't so bad (time for one IPA and a glass of wine for my wife), and our Lou's classic pizza was great. I was a bit surprised at the amount of sausage on the pie - A LOT of sausage. But you know what? I scraped the sausage off the leftover pieces to add to a sauce for an Italian meal at home a night later. Voila!   Thanks, Lou Malnati's - glad you're here when I need a deep dish fix!",

    "text": "Ok think it's time for a review after dining at Lou's for 4 times. Yes 4 times because I loved the pizza so much!  Heck even went two times in a week. Why do I keep coming back, well the pizza of course. I find myself craving Chicago deep dish pizza more than any other pizzas. I'm so glad that we are finally getting real Chicago pizza here in the valley. I just read that more authentic Chicago pizza joints are coming here. I really think they waited to see how much success Lou's is having and by the packed house every night they having much success!  Now on to my experiences. First I was leery of the long waits I've read about. But it's really not that bad. You can check in at the host stand then you can put your pizza order. So if the wait is long, by the time you actually sit down the wait for the pizza is not long at all. This is a great idea! I've been to a local pizza restaurant here in the valley and had to wait an hour for a seat..the. 45 mins for pizza. This way of ordering is much more efficient and enjoyable.   Now for the pizza, we seem to order the classic with extra sauce each time. Recently we ordered a pepperoni with the butter crust and that was amazing! So much pepperoni! Probably not the most healthy but wow who cares. I'll just spend an extra hour at the gym the next day.   Overall it's a great restaurant. I've even been here with my \"Chicago Friend\" and he gives it a thumbs up.lol.",

    "text": "Yummm!! My new fave pizza joint. Well for those days when I'm feeling a little extra, can splurge on a $25 pizza, and have an extra hour to spare on waiting just to get sat (and no they don't do reservations).  Maybe it was because it was a Saturday night and we didn't plan accordingly, but we had no clue it would be this crazy busy. Lots of bday celebrations happening here. It was our whole crews first go at this place. My guy and I show up at 6:30pm in hopes of grabbing a table for 10 by 7pm. Nope. We're simply added to a wait list and told the wait is an hour and 45min.  It's a good thing there is a brewery across the way to sit, chit chat and kill sometime at, with no wait! Yay! The ice cream shop next door was cool too, but the wait for that was an hour long.  Ok so finally we get in. It's a bit noisy but the atmosphere is fun and our waiter is attentive and gives us the spiel on the history of the place, shared some interesting facts on how the hard AZ water was no bueno for their pizza dough and how they teamed up with Starbucks to make it work.  We order our appetizers and drinks. A pitcher of Kilt Lifter and an orange blossom beer. Btw happy hour is Mon-Thurs 4-6. House salad with lemon garlic dressing and the pizza chip trio were tasty. Finally the pizza arrives. 1 deep dish pepperoni, 1 deep dish Lou, and a thin crust pepperoni. I had the DD pep. The crust was crisp to perfection. No soggy middle plus oogy-gooey cheese stretching from plate to mouth. Warning: Chew well before swallowing or else you might just choke on the cheese. The menu says that the large pizza only serves 4 but I had 1 slice and was full, mind you I'm a lightweight and can't woof it down like my guy who ate 4 DD slices and most of the pizza chips himself.  Long story short, the food was great enough to make up for the long wait, good company helps too. I'll definitely be back, maybe for my birthday in April . The best gift a a pizza lover, like me, can ask for! I LOooVe  me some pizza",

    "text": "Malnati's stays True to its Chicago roots, with comedically thick slices of \"pizza,\" loaded with cheese, cheese, veggies, meats, sauce, and cheese.  My partner grew up near Chicago, and to him this is--of course--what pizza looks, tastes, and eats like.    But I struggle.    To order this pizza in Italy, you'd be better off ordering a pasta dish, sneaking in a brick of mozzarella, and combining both with a basic piece of bread.  Okay, that had nothing to do with anything.  Just a random thought.   Back to my gripe with Malnati's.  I like it plenty in Chicago where it feels right at home in the biting winter, preceded by and chased down with a pitcher of Old Style and another crappy Bears team, but in Phoenix it just feels forced.  It's far from the first Chicago retread, and it's bound to be similarly successful (regardless of Yelp review).  I guess it's not completely fair to punish Malnati's for any of that, so I'll move on to the food.  The pizza, a term used liberally, is more akin to a giant mozzarella stick with pizza toppings.  It is mostly Mozzarella, a thin breading at the bottom and thicker crust at the end, a hearty helping of admittedly tasty tomato sauce, and generous toppings.  But it simply lacks the cohesion of a great pizza.  It's practically impossible to eat by hand, the bottom breading is soggy because of the heaps of cheese and sauce on top of it, and by the time you've finished a slice, you're not exactly craving the next one.  You might have another to overkill your appetite, but it doesn't have you yearning for more like a well-balanced Neopolitan or wood-fire oven. Or a (gasp) Brooklyn style slice.    I've committed enough Chicago sacrilege for one review.  I'll close by recommending this place (or soon, Gino's East's desert location) to anyone that hasn't tried Chicago style pizza before.  I suppose you should try it simply because it might be for you.  But as far as pizza--perhaps one of America's favorite repeat meals--this brand simply doesn't command much repeating.",

The ingredients are fresh and tasty but it's like eating stewed tomatoes and hunks of parmigiano cheese thrown together and heated up in a bowl. Also begs the question, is this really pizza? Can't see why it takes them at least half an hour to make except for the strange crust which I really didn't like. FYI the place is an extremely LOUD zoo!",

We knew it was going to be super busy so we went a little later than we wanted to try and avoid some of the dinner rush. When we got there it was about a 30-minute wait. Their app for seeing your wait time was awesome but it was longer than they quoted, by about 15-minutes. We know how long the pizza takes so we preordered when we put our names in. So we waited 45-minutes to be seated and it still took about 45-minutes to get our pizza once we sat down. I am pretty sure they forgot to start the order so we were starving by the time the food arrived but it was as delicious as we remembered and we will still go back.",

    "text": "I came across this place with a friend when we found ourselves needing to pass some time and grab some sunshine. I noticed the hip patio with misters which seemed super relaxing especially with their plush seat cushions, booth style, my favorite. I brought my little pup Stella to relax under the table accompanied by some fresh water the lovely waitress brought us. Attracted by the happy hour options (menu pic below) we found ourselves ordering 'House Chardonnay' ($5) which was exactly as expected. Drinking up an appetite, we then ordered the 'Trio of Dips' ($8) which was amazing. It comes with pizza chips, which grew on us after a couple of bites since they are not your usual dipping option, and three delicious dips all ranging in flavor to touch on every taste bud. After realizing we were a still a bit hungry we ordered the Small Deep Chicago Classic ($15.50) for 4 deep dish slices, keep in mind these do take about 30 minutes or so, so if you know you're going to get one & time is of the essence, let the waitress know ahead of time, or don't, and wait it out and relax in the chill ambience of the patio! All was delicious, I can admit I did have higher expectations for the pizza. It is a butter crust classic which to be quite frank I'm not sure I noticed a difference, and the crust is actually quite thin, taking away from the deep dish concept. I even added some crushed red peppers to spice it up a bit and add some flavor since I thought it was lacking a tad.. In all, I would return, the service was great, the patio was amazing, I probably would just choose a different entree option, the food looked delicious it was just lacking flavor, in other words something with more pizazz.",

By the time we were seated our pizza was just about done. We had a very little wait compared to the first visit. We also ordered a salad and a pasta dish. Both good, but nothing too special.

    "text": "I've eaten at Lou Malnati's a couple of times while in Chicago. They have been a staple there since the early seventies and have locations all over the windy city. With the Cub's spring training and the all the Chicago folks that come here, restaurants like Lou's, Portillo's and Genos East are making their way to the Valley. What makes this one special is that it is located in the renovated Uptown Plaza (a landmark 1950s shopping center that is now a hotbed of new restaurants). Lou Malnati's did a lot of preparation and research to try and replicate the chain's signature pizza for their first location outside of Chicago.  The restaurant itself is tucked away in the back corner of Uptown Plaza with lots of room for people to mix and mingle on a grassy area while waiting for a table. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. We actually didn't wait too long for a table. If you are going to order one of their delicious deep dish pizzas, give yourself a good 30 - 45 minutes for them to make it. The flaky, buttery crust is made from scratch and they use fresh mozzarella cheese, vine-ripened tomatoes and a nice blend of sausage. You just can't beat how good Chicago deep dish is and we ended up taking most of it home. I think we are pretty lucky to have a little taste of Chicago here in AZ. It can get a little crowded at times, but the experience makes it worth it.",

We ordered a light appetizer and, of course, requested a deep dish with the butter crust!  (Quick anecdote, we were transplants from Chicago that now live in Los Angeles who came to visit Phoenix to catch a Cubs Spring Training game in Mesa.  As native Chicagoans, we knew our deep dish!)  Here's where it gets a little rocky, many minutes pass by and our pizza hasn't shown up yet. We knew we've been waiting for awhile, but figured that deep dish takes a bit of time to cook properly. It was a busy night and the servers were dashing around. Alas, we made it this far, we can wait a few more minutes. After a while our server comes out to apologize because one of the ovens was not functioning properly and our pizza was delayed (unsure if that was True or if they just simply forgot our pizza, but whatever). She said it would be out within the half hour, but in the meantime they offered a complimentary appetizer for the wait, to which we obliged.  She brought out the appetizer we requested, and a little under 20 minutes later we received our properly cooked deep dish (yep, we checked!).  Perhaps we were clueless and gave them the benefit of the doubt, but it was pleasing that they acknowledged the situation and sought to make our extend wait a little more comfortable. Kudos to our server and the management!",

We ordered an appetizer to eat while we waited for the pizza but after a bite or two I was surprised with a piece of glass in my food which made me feel disgusted to say the least. I wanted to leave , but I came with family and they were all eager to eat Lou malnatis. So we stayed and we informed the manager who was working at the time and she was very nice and apologetic and offered to take care of the bill which was very nice of her . The rest of the food excluding the appetizer were delicious as always.   . No love lost, but a little paranoid going forward :/",

If that is any Indication of how good they are, then it must be worth the wait.  They cool thing is that once your table is reserved, then you can order. We did that and ran over to AJ's and grabbed iced tea to wait it out. Wait wasn't bad. Staff was great and customer service was excellent.  On to the food. I'm from California, so I am not schooled on proper deep dish. That being said, it was delicious. Great mix of ingredients and a great cook.   We will come back again for sure",

    "text": "Since roughly 80% of Phoenix seems to be from Chicago (and will remind you of this regularly), I'm not surprised that yet another popular Chicago-based chain would target Phoenix as part of an expansion plan.     Initially, I knew that during the first few weeks, this place would be a complete zoo. My girlfriend and I decided to wait a couple weeks for the buzz to die down. Even so, despite the fact that we dine out in Phoenix quite regularly, I don't think I've ever experienced a crowd like this without visiting a theme park. Total madness!  You're allowed to pre-order your pizza while you're waiting, which will allegedly cut down on your wait time. They also use a clever little app, which allows you to frequently check your place in the queue. I must say, this is a very good approach to have. Although since the front portion of the restaurant is basically a bar, it's kind of hard to distinguish between those people standing in line versus those who are just standing around.  Lou's has often been said to be the \"gold standard\" of deep dish pizza, so obviously expectations were pretty high going in. They have both patio and indoor seating, but it becomes fairly obvious that they need much more dining space than they currently offer. The whole bar area is wasted space and I feel they underestimated the amount of people in Phoenix that would dine here.  Our wait time was exactly two hours on an early Saturday evening. Our server, who was friendly, confirmed our pre-order of a large pepperoni deep dish. In the meantime, we ordered their three cheese bread. The bread was actually decent. A big, long slice served with a generous portion of sauce. We were both pleased by its taste and the quality of the sauce, bread, and cheeses.  The pizza, which we timed, took exactly sixty minutes. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that pre-ordering makes minimal difference in wait time. When it was finally brought out to us, it didn't take us very long to conjure up a solid opinion. The cheese, sauce, and pepperoni were all great quality. The crust, however, which I consider to be the heart of a great pizza, was extremely lackluster. It was very crunchy, had zero flavor, and offered absolutely no moisture or flakiness that I've come to expect from a well made deep dish. Both of us were kind of in utter shock. I mean, if this is what the people of Chicago consider to be an ideal version of deep dish pizza, then their standards are much lower than I originally thought. If there was, in fact, butter flavor in the crust, it was virtually undetectable.      The question is, was our pizza simply a botched pie or is this standard procedure?  Unfortunately, that's something we'd have to return for in order to determine.  For dessert, we split a pizza cookie. We've had some pretty decent pizza cookies at other local establishments, so we assumed this one would be on par. Most restaurants only partially bake the cookie, giving it a lovely gooey texture. Our cookie was literally stuck to the pan, which you had to dig to even find due to the excessive amounts of ice and whipped cream they use on top. In the end, we were disappointed - which rarely happens when it comes to anything related to cookies.  I'll give them an extra star due to their food prices being reasonable, the portions being generous, and the server being polite. And if the pizza were amazing, I'd easily forgive the long wait times. But this is one situation where I simply can't give out a high rating for a pizza joint that can't get their crust right. We might come back at some point, but with so many great options for pizza in Central Phoenix, I doubt it'll be anytime soon.  Not recommended.",

It was so good. The cheese way gooey and yummy. The crust was buttery and light the way a crust is supposed to be. I can see why my friends said this was the place to go for real Chicago pizza. And the app plate was delish with fried cheese cubes were yummy and they don't skimp on the dips with real buttermilk ranch.  The owner was super nice and chatted up all the people waiting for tables. The wait was 20 mins but so worth it and they text you when your table is ready and even an app shows you your place in line. The waiter was super nice and the staff are very friendly and great with their tips on good food.  Overall a great place to have pizza and get your deep dish fix with. Also the back corner booth is great for people watching. You can see the whole place.",

Does it allow annoying people like me to pretend like she has appropriate food habits by getting \"pizza\" like a regular person who isn't afraid of bread? Yes.  Another great option if you want to look especially sociopathic and actually forego pizza ALL TOGETHER at a pizza place is the Manalti Salad. Guys, this salad is the best salad I've ever eaten. My boyfriend and I have split the family style order, which I believe is meant for 6-8 people, in one sitting and we have no regrets.  Once we were eating it in the bar and no less than 3 complete strangers complimented us on our salad. I've never been more proud of something I had so little to do with.

The waiter arrived less than a minute later, full of apologies (we had a 2 yr old with us so waiting is usually a dicey thing). We ordered right away. One of our salads (small spinach) came in about 10 minutes, and the other (Buffalo chicken) came several minutes later. The spinach salad was big enough o share even though it was the small, was pretty good, but way too much dressing. Buffalo small salad was also big enough to share and was much better. The pizza was great--love the crust. We had a thin crust cheese, tomato, sausage, and black olive. Thank heaven the 2 yr Old was fairly compliant but ended up having to take her out into the park outside Before the entire party was finished eating because food took a while to arrive at the table.

    "text": "I've been a customer of Malnati's since it opened in Lincolnwood circa 1971? My stepfather was a liquor salesman and one of his accounts was this building, he had the business in that place before it was Malnati's too. So I remember Lou from the first month he was open and I was a kid in 8th grade. Nuff said.  I love their pizzas. Everytime I go to Chicago we ALWAYS get Malnati delivery.   They have carry-out frozen pizzas (10\"); sausage, cheese, pepperoni and two others for sale right inside the front door on the left in a tall freezer case, just grab what you want and pay for them right at the counter just inside from the front door, doesn't get much easier than that.  These frozen pizzas are simple to cook: preheat the oven to 425, remove the cardboard top from the frozen pizza pan, remove the frozen pizza, wipe the pan dry and spray the inside with any kind of lite oil, replace and stick it in the oven for 40 minutes.  Remove the pizza, use a scissors to make several vertical cuts in the side of the aluminum baking pan so you can slide the pizza out onto your own pizza pan for slicing.  This is without a doubt the best frozen pizza in this country. I buy them three at a time, it costs me about $45 for three to carry out. I have a styrofoam box I carry them home in since I live like 35 miles from this place.  It's in the strip mall at the north-east corner of Camelback at Central, way back in the corner of the mall. Look for the ice cream place next door. The place is hard to see from the parking lot, but it's there. The mall is right across the street from a tall bronze and black colored office building about ten stories tall, let that be your landmark to watch for. Turn into the mall at the traffic light on Cameback at 1st Street.   My only complaint about this place is the employees can be lacking in motivation sometimes. If I could I would give Malnati's in Phoenix 4.5 stars.",

They import all of their sausage from Chicago, cheese from Wisconsin and use the same suppliers that they do in Chicago. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad which was very fresh and tasty! The use a balsamic vinaigrette that is perfect!  We also tried the cheesy spinach bread which was the same bread dough as the pizza buttercrust. We ordered the Malanati's Chicago Classic pan pizza which is good ol' fashioned fresh Chicago Italian sausage layered between fresh cheese and vine ripe tomato sauce! Excellence in a pan!",

The prices are reflective of the atmosphere which I realized is why I was paying that amount for a pizza. I much prefer paying for quality over atmosphere especially if both are great. This vote for me just was influenced solely by atmosphere. Also, be sure to set aside some time for the pizza to be prepared. This style of pizza takes a little time to cook through thoroughly.",

The pizza was ready on time. It was recommended to get it uncut, which we did. I think that was a good call. We got the medium deep dish with cheese.  The sauce is how I remember it tasting in IL. However, the last time I had it in IL it seemed there was too much crust. It wasn't always like that before.  So maybe it's how they make it now because the AZ deep-dish is the same, more crust. I'll still go back because I love my pizza! Don't think I'd want to eat in house. Just way too crowded for me.",

Years ago we found that heating up the slices in a medium heat fry pan brings the pizza back to life.  It takes a little bit of extra time but well worth it.   Last night we all simply couldn't wait and ate the first piece right out of the box.  Delicious but the crust had softened and cheese cooled in transit to the East Valley (no surprise). Reheated the second and 3rd slice in the frying pan and it was spot on.  Welcome to Phoenix and thanks for the slice of heaven from our homeland!  The carry-out process was very efficient.

I experienced deep dish pizza in downtown Chicago so I was very excited to hear of one opening up in Phx.  It was my sons 1st experience and they are pizza freaks & loved it!

    "text": "Worth the wait. I was hoping that would be the case while sitting in line for almost two hours. Thank god that ended up being the case. I didn't appreciate being told it would be 45 minutes and actually end up being an hour and a half. It didn't help I was dying of starvation from not eating all day and it being 10:30pm. I am not about judging a restaurant based on the wait times. They can't help they are this in demand. Once we sat down our waitress was very nice and thanked us for waiting so long. Luckily they give you an option while waiting in line to preorder your pizza so that they have it to your table within 15 minutes of sitting down. Normally deep dish pizza can be up to a 45 minute wait. We ordered an appetizer (3 cheese bread). It was delicious. It comes with some marinara which was good too. By the time we finish the appetizer the pizza arrives. One bite in and I am overcome with relief that the pizza was by far and away worth the wait. The ingredients are amazing. The crust was probably one of the best parts. Some deep dish crust gets a little soggy. Not here. There crust was like a pie crust in how in was dry and how it broke apart as you bite into it. The tomatoes are big standouts when you take a bite. You can tell they use the best ingredients. I got sausage, pepperoni and onions. I love their sausage. My mouth is just bursting with flavor from every direction with all these delectable ingredients. I love the way the restaurant is set up. It is pretty cool looking with a bar in a separate room, the check in in a separate room and the dining room in a separate room as well. The dining room is filling with multiple huge TVs playing all Chicago games that may be on TV at the time. The whole dining room set up looks really nice. Everyone was friendly, especially our server. Food comes out fast. When you come to a restaurant like this you shouldn't really consider the cost. You are about to devour an American treasure. Luckily the cost was very fair and comparable, despite the demand. They have a gorgeous patio too if you don't want to dine inside. I am glad I made the drive from Chandler to come here. No regrets. Maybe just wait a few weeks for it to hopefully die down a little bit. Everyone wants to come now so unless you like a wait maybe hold off a bit.",

Actually had to sprinkle a little salt on it to give it any taste.   The layered,  pale sausage is plentiful but tastes like a bland breakfast patty.   The sauce was virtually flavorless.   Plenty of cheese but that is not what makes a great pie.   Plenty of better local deep dish pies in town.   Very disappointing for all the buildup to this joint coming to town.",

I'm not a deep dish connoisseur but have eaten at Masa in LA and Uno enough to know what I like and don't like in a deep dish pizza.  I thought the crust of the Original at Malnati's was too hard! Even though it was called butter crust, it was flaky or buttery, just too crunchy! To be honest I thought it tasted better as left overs because some of the crunch was gone and I could taste the buttery crust better.   I got the original which comes with extra cheese, sausage and sauce.  The sauce was amazing...next time I'll order it with extra sauce. There was a lot of cheese but not too much which I was happy about.  The overall ambience at the establishment was great. I loved the outdoor seating and the misters in the almost summer heat were wonderful.  I would DEFINITELY recommend getting the Malnati's salad. Everyone in my party LOVED it, and if I ever came back here again I might just order a salad and eat that instead of the pizza.  We came at 5:45 and were seated immediately. This alone was worth coming to the Phoenix location! I'd go again, but this wasn't my favorite deep dish I've ever had.",

Our waiter served my party of 12 each of their slices. Nice touch. As for the grub, our appetizers were great.  The signature \"Malnati\" salad was awesome and house salad very good. The spinach filled bread loaf was good as were the wings. As for the pizzas, we tried three deep dish. The two signature pies and a cheese were good. Not amazing but good.

My husband and I moved to AZ a year and a half ago and we have probably been here a half dozen times. Needless to say, I was STOKED to learn they had a location in Phoenix.  We get the same thing every time...the deep dish with butter crust. It's so good I can't imagine ordering anything else. I have tried their soups and appetizers and those are always great.  My only recommendation is to get there early as there can sometimes be a wait. Also, be prepared to give yourself about 45 minutes before the pizza comes out. They take a while to cook but I promise you they are well worth it!   I am excited to see another location has opened up and would love to visit there also!",

There are different types of pizza.. you have the thin greasy NY style pizza which I looove, but then you also have the thick Chicago style that is full of cheese. Both are fabulous. Lou Malnati's is Chicago style. Thick, full of cheese, sauce, toppings and flavor.  All of the pizzas we ordered were tasty.   I was expecting this to be the case. However I was not expecting to be absolutely blown away by the best salad EVER.  We all kept passing the salad around in amazement. I found myself actually eye balling the salad even after the pizza came. Haha.. how often does that happen?    The staff was very kind and we had a wonderful waiter.

    "text": "Lou is the last big kahuna that comes to mind that continually puts Phoenix on the U.S. map.  They are one of the legitimate anchors in the Uptown Phoenix Plaza that can easily draw folks from all over the valley.  I've been to Chicago before, but I never had my chance to sink my teeth into Lou's.  But seeing them on television and other medias, it definitely amplifies your desire to try some exceptionally good Chicago Pizza.  As the fanboy I was, I did end up getting a snap with Marc himself.  It was a great pleasure to meet him, he has such a down to earth vibe to him.  Like many others, the wife and I showed up in a long queue that had us waiting for more than an hour.  Luckily, staff members brought out cold water and some pizza samples to try.  So it wasn't too bad.  And at that time, I wish Pokemon Go existed so that waiting would've just flew by.    Onward to the Pizza.  We opted for the classic dish, of course.  After it arrived on our table, as the Yelp Elites we are, you have to take pictures at a million angles before you decide on the right one to post on Instagram.  Moments later, we weren't hungry anymore and left.  Just kidding.  We finally took our first bite and wow, you can taste that famous butter, flaky crust with those handmade savory sausages.  Yes, it lived up to the hype machine.  The other element about their pizza is in it's fresh tasting tomato sauce.  It's light and not too rich.  Doing so, helps complement the crust and sausage.  If you come in a group of 2 or even 3, I would consider the small size as each slice is very, very filling.  You can have it with a side of salad of your choice.  Next time, I'm definitely going to try some other items.    If you don't know, now you know.  Midwest meets Southwest.",

    "text": "I reeeeeeally wanted to click 5 stars but I just couldn't do it.  Pizza was really good but I think in all fairness, my expectations were just too high.  We ordered the classic deep dish with sausage, extra cheese and we added pepperoni.  The ingredients were all really good-but used in a way that threw me off.  I loved the chunky tomatoes, but where was the sauce?  (If I took a bite without a tomato, it was just too dry.)  The sausage tasted great, but having it as a complete layer on the pizza was too much for me.  It should be described as a sausage lover's special because there is so much of it.  Lots of cheese, which is good.  And the sacred Chicago crust?  Well it was close-but still not close enough that I could eat it by itself like I do in Chicago.   Bottom line-If you want one of the best deep dish pizzas outside of Chicago-Lou's doesn't disappoint but for me-it was still missing something.   I will definitely be back for another try.  On another, non-food related note:  Having an employee walk directly past your table with rubber gloves on carrying a toilet plunger doesn't help.",

    "text": "Phew!  That was close!  The very astute server could tell (maybe from the angry scowl and the banging on my mobile device) that I was not a happy camper.  The first thing she said was, \"would you guys like to move to a bigger table?\"  Not only did that result in a bigger tip for her, but it saved what could have potentially been a nasty review.  I've been wanting to try the local Lou's ever since it opened, but the long lines/wait times coupled with Arizona heat has kept me away.  That all changed recently, when the kids were in town and said, \"we want Lou's\".  So, at rush hour on a Tuesday afternoon, we piled into the car to head to Uptown Plaza.  Traffic was horrible, but we finally arrived and found a spot near the courtyard that hosts Lou's.  Incredibly, it almost looked as though they were not open.  The hostess greeted us and we requested a table in the patio area.  She walked our party of five through the mostly empty patio to a corner away from the misters, right next to the door to the kitchen where the staff were congregating and sat us at a table hardly big enough for two.  I asked for a different table.  She offered to bring another chair.  I glared at her and we sat as she scurried away back to her podium.  Note to Lou's - training. Your hostess needs training in how to interpret clues and adapt to a situation to provide a quick solution.  The patio seats what, 60 or so people?  When it is practically empty, allow customers some flexibility as to where they can sit.  (rant over)  Our server-in-training was eager to please, polite and very smart.  She immediately recognized that there was a problem and solved it.  Moving us to a table that actually fit five people, we ordered beverages and some wings while we scanned the menu.  We ordered a Classic, a Lou's personal, a Gluten-Free and had the Biltmore Blonde microbrew.  After a bit, the wings came around and we devoured them.  Nicely crisped, meaty and coated with a mild hot sauce, they were quite tasty.  For me, a hotter sauce option would have been nice.  They offer a mild hot and a barbecue.  Wings come with celery sticks and your choice of dipping dressing.  The pizza's took a long time.  Not surprised though, I've been to the original Lou's in downtown Chicago on a night when it was -25f, and the place was packed, wall to wall people.  It took a long time there too, so we were expecting a wait.  Despite that, the manager came around, apologized for the long wait and offered us a free dessert.  Okay, the kids love pizooki, and she sent over two of them.  They were the typical baked choco-chip cookie with a pile of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream topped with a cherry.  Kids loved them.  The pizza's were perfect, as expected.  The Chicago classic is a deep-dish, baked with their butter crust, filled with savory sausage and a layer of mozzarella, topped with a fresh tomato sauce.  This is the pizza I dream about.  My wife, a vegetarian, had the \"Lou\", spinach, mushrooms, and roma tomatoes with their deep-dish buttercrust delivery mechanism.  She loved it.  Older daughter had the gluten-free, which is a thin-crust cheese pizza, again, a winner.  Service was exceptional, food was outstanding.  Hostess sucks.  Lou's is a five-star pizza.",

We purposely arrived at about 11:30 to avoid a rush and were one of only a few people in the restaurant.  When we kept asking when the food would arrive the server kept saying that is was \"just about up.\"    I ordered a personal deep dish pizza for one, but was charged for a small pizza for two, about a $8-9 difference.  My colleague whose birthday we were celebrating was asked if she wanted a complimentary dessert, which she accepted to go. It took forever to arrive and then she was charged for the dessert on her bill.    I have had many many deep dish pizzas--- and was actually excited to try this place as I have spent many wonderful times in Chicago pizza joints. My pizza was not very good-- not flavorful and even though I ordered the cheese and sausage variety, I could not find any sausage on the pizza at all.    Trying to get our checks cashed out was a never ending process....even though the server knew that we needed to get going.  Not a good experience.....I will not be going back!!",

The last time I came, we waited for 2 hours, and this time we waited less than 5 minutes.  This time we stopped in on a Thursday night.  It was around 6:00 and we were seated pretty quickly.  The service was spot on this time.  Our waitress was Charlene, she was awesome!  She was attentive, friendly, and very accommodating  We had an idea what we wanted, but she recommended the Chicago classic, which we went with.  As my previous review stated, I've always been a huge fan of Lou's seriously some of the best deep dish pizza ever and in Phoenix, there is no contest.   In conclusion, the wait times can get pretty long, especially on the weekends.  Its not a very huge place, but they do have a big area for the bar and outside.  I would recommend going during the week.  Overall, best deep dish pizza without a doubt.  The sausage and the cheese is a difference maker, your not gonna find anything even close in the Phoenix area.  Thanks Nicole!",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  A few weeks ago, on my way down to the airport to pick up my mom, I ordered a pizza from here for takeout.  I did it online and it was a very easy process.  I placed an order for a small sausage and onion thin crust pizza, well done and cut.  I drove down, walked inside and picked up my order.  The first thing I noticed was that their \"small\", is really small.  Its barely 10 inches?  The box it came in was the size of the boxes places usually give you for your leftovers.  I took it out to my car to eat.  When I opened the box, it looked good, but the first thing I noticed was that the pizza was not cut.  LAME!  On their website, you have the option to have it cut or uncut (they recommend uncut for takeout pizzas) and I chose cut, but this one was a whole pizza.  Thankfully, since it was so small, I managed my way through sauce on my hands to tear it apart and eat it fairly neatly.  Still.....if you order it cut, cut the damn thing!  Anyways.....flavors were pretty good.  The cheese was nice and browned, there was plenty of sausage on it and the crust was nice and firm/crisp.  Not the best thin crust Chicago style pizza I have had, but it was alright.    Fast forward to 08/13..............  Decided to come back with my buddies to dine in on Saturday afternoon.  We arrived and were seated immediately which was nice!  We decided to go with a medium Malnati Chicago Classic, and a medium The Lou thin crust.  Took about 40 minutes for the pizzas to cook and come out.  Here is how they were...................  The Malnati Chicago Classic (deep dish)-  We tried this slice first.  I was impressed!  Lots of crushed tomatoes on top, a good creamy dose of cheese, and a bunch of sausage.  All of this was layered on top of their famous butter crust.  This was one rich pizza!  I ate 2 slices of it and was stuffed beyond belief.  As you will see, I wish we hadn't have ordered the thin crust pizza, and just got a larger size of this one.  It is their classic pizza, and rightfully so.  It was very tasty and I would 100% get this one again.  The Lou-  This thin crust pizza came with spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes on top.  When it came out, I knew right away that I wouldn't like it as much as the deep dish one.  For whatever reason, it just didn't look that great.  A bite into it, and it was confirmed.  There was an overpowering mushroom taste.  And not in a good way.  The mushrooms were way too \"earthy\" and overpowered the other flavors of the pizza.  Not sure if they don't cook the mushrooms first and throw them on there raw, or what.  Something about them was \"off\" though.  The thin crust on the pizza was good, but that's about it.  I wasn't a fan of the spinach they used, either.  It almost seemed like it was sheets of spinach, almost like seaweed sheets?  Flat layers of spinach?  Not impressed.  I barely made it through my one slice of this and out of the 6 slices in the pizza, 4 of them were taken home by my buddy.  Would never ever order this one again.  The flavors were whack!  Overall, stick with the deep dish Malnati Chicago Classic and you will be happy.  Service was great, wait time was not too long, and the prices are good for the sheer amount of food you get.  Will I be back?  Probably.  I'm not rushing down Central Ave anytime soon craving this place, but I'm sure I will be back in due time.",

We did the Lou's special pizza and the Lou's salad. Way too much food for two people. As per usual, the husband's eyes were much larger than his belly so he ordered an enormous pizza (and for newbies, this pizza is like two pizza's on top of each other) and really could have been happy with one slice but just had to muscle down that good slice for good measure. The good news is is that the pizza heats up really well for leftovers. Fun spot, cool vibe, bomb pizza!",

    "text": "Wow. We tried to get in here one night for dinner and the line was INSANE, so we bailed and planned to come back some time when it was less busy.  Saturday at 11am and we happened to be downtown. There was no line and we basically walked right in. The place started to fill up as we finished our pizza and headed out a little after noon, so plan accordingly. Some of the reasons for the lines: the interior is pretty small and a deep dish pizza takes 30+ minutes to cook.  The TL;DR - We are very glad we decided to come back. The kids agreed that it was the best deep dish pizza they have ever had (one said it was the best PIZZA he has ever had). Get the pizza \"well done\" and maybe skip breakfast to prepare.   For the rest of the story...  We eat a lot of pizza and I have been to Chicago a few times. I have had pizza there, but I never made it to one of Lou's many locations. Unlucky me. Sure, People from Chicago like to brag about their pizza, and much of what I had there was thick and dense (pizza by WEIGHT). I could barely finish one slice, much less two. It has been a while, but the pizza here is different from that. Lou's is is a thick crust pizza without the \"touristification.\" Meaning, the pizza is \"Chicago style\" thick without being obscenely so: its reason for being is not to hold the table down.  Our waiter, Daniel, suggested getting the pies \"well done,\" which means cooking them a bit longer and drying up a bit more of the moisture. I don't know how the regular pizza comes out, but our well-done pies with butter crusts were perfect. I was pleasantly surprised that the crust itself was CRISPY: even the bottom of the pizza came out crispy and not soft or soggy like so many other thick crust offerings.   The mozzarella has excellent flavor, and so does the pizza dough. The tomatoes and pork sausage provide nice supporting flavor without being overwhelming. Apparently, there are no bold spices in the sausage to distract you from the other subtle flavor combination. I think that is interesting and very nicely done. Daniel suggested we add pepperoni to the sausage to provide some contrast. DO IT.  We had two small pizzas for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. I ate 2 1/2 slices and we took home about a half a pizza. We got the deep dish classic, add pepperoni, and the deep dish cheese with garlic butter crust (WARNING: you must like garlic for this one. They don't mess around or skimp on it!)  I can't speak to the salads, desserts or bar drinks, however, everyone was happy with the food and both Daniel's recommendations and service. We will definitely be back.",

While the decor is spectacular, and I enjoy the raised booths, there is something missing from the food I order.  The last time we had a chicken alfredo and it was super Bland and the chicken was rubbery so I didn't order it this time.  Due to some scrumptious pictures of the calamari on Yelp I order that tonight and while the calamari was nicely cooked  the breading itself lacked any seasoning or flavor.  We are not fans of deep dish though our companions are , so we ordered a thin crust, and found that the cheese got cold easily and hardened faster than we could eat it, probably because it was cut into so many pieces.  We also asked for the lou Malnati salad without dressing on it and it came with dressing anyways.   The experience was worth it because of the company we were meeting with but I don't think that we would return on our own accord because of these reasons.",

I pride myself on being a pizza connoisseur (I even have a pizza sweater that makes me look like a walking slice) and this place does NOT disappoint. It's a must try. This is definitely a pizza pie by the very definition and it leaves you feeling more satisfied than your regular hand tossed slice. You will find yourself day dreaming about wanting more days after. The quality of the cheese and sauce is an indulgence but the best part is the magical yeasty crust (like the way homemade bread tastes right out of the oven.) I have yet to have had a better deep dish experience. Pizza lovers rejoice!",

So I came here during the week on a date and loved everything about this place! It has a very cute retro feel to it, all of the servers are very nice and since we went just about after the lunch rush we got a table right away. I will say that the wait time for our food was a lot longer than I expected. We went through 2 glasses before our food finally arrived.  We ordered the signature pizza which is The Malnati Chicago Classic, it was amazing!!!! It's so thick that you have to eat this slice with a knife and fork but every bite has the flavor of everything packed into it. We ordered the medium which serves 3 but we both ended up being full after just 1 slice so we could have just stuck with a small. The plus side to the leftovers is that I took them home and the next day popping them into the oven, they came out tasting just as great! Very pleased with the service and food at this place. I can't wait to go back and try a different pizza on the menu",

The salad come after just a couple of minutes and it blew my mind away. Nice size and very fresh crisp vegetables. I had the Balsamic vinegar and olive oil separate from my salad so I could control just the amount I wanted. Our pizza came about 30 minutes later. Our waiter, Andrew, who was from the Chicago restaurant was superb. He will only be here for a short time as he was brought in to train the staff. It really rated 5 stars but I wanted to just deduct 1/2 star due to the flooring. Just don't look down when walking as the pattern makes one quite dizzy. I wish they had done the large tiles or even laminate. It is too large of an area for such a pattern. Maybe just a touch of it here and there would have been better. Parking is very difficult at this strip mall but that is nothing new as it has always been difficult to park there. Handicap spots are also very few and far between.",

    "text": "One easy way to start an argument about pizza is to put the words \"deep dish\" in front of it. Is it still pizza? Or more like a lasagna? Is it legal to eat pizza with a knife and fork? Who's willing to wait a half hour while their pizza bakes?  All these questions would be answered in my visit to Lou Malnati's and my first time encountering deep dish pizza after years of NY and Neapolitan. For the sake of comparison I sampled both their classic deep dish and the thin crust. My final conclusion: While there are a lot of differences, I can understand the hype to a degree. It's an interesting take on pizza with some positives and negatives.   Let's start with the sauce. The cooked deep dish sauce features roughly ground tomato chunks floating around and a very subtle flavor. The deep dish is proportionately mostly sauce but it doesn't dominate the pizza.  It's really more reminiscent of a marinara made for pasta, lending credence to my pre-conception that deep dish is closer to lasagna than pizza. The sauce on the thin crust pizza was noticeably different in a good way. It exploded with a big kick of sugar and butter which was very enjoyable. I can understand not using it in the deep dish because it would be way too much; on the thinner crust though, it shined.   Onto the cheese- Malnati's places their Wisconsin mozzarella on the bottom layer of the pizza just above the dough. It makes for an interesting experience but I'm not so sure I enjoy it. The weak flavor of mozzarella cheese really benefits from the browning it gets when on top in the oven. Buried beneath all the sauce, it never really had a chance. If ooey-gooey white cheese if your thing, you might like it more. But for others, I'd recommend asking for less. The thin crust pizza had a solid layer which didn't brown very much either, but it didn't detract from the experience because there was so much less of it.   The crust is where Malnati's caught my interest. It's a very different crust than every other pizza place I've visited. It's the most enjoyable part of the entire pie highlighted by some major differences. The crust is very buttery and flakey, almost more similar to a pie crust. Aside from using a good amount of butter, this is likely due to a low hydration level on the dough. When you use less water, the dough gets thick and tears instead of stretching. There's also little to no gas bubbles in the crust which means some combination of low hydration and under/over fermenting. The differences are essential to deep dish! You need a compact and tough dough that can stay crispy and firm under the weight of sauce and cheese. A normal airy dough would collapse completely. The strong buttery taste also helps the dough to stand out in the final mix. The thin crust pizza featured more or less the same dough, and it served to create the same experience on a smaller scale.   While I wasn't impressed by the deep dish sauce or cheese, I can see myself coming back for the unique crust. But push come to shove, and I'm likely to opt for the thin crust which was a far better overall experience. I just can't get over the feeling that I'm eating pasta. Un-browned cheese, chunks of tomatoes in the marinara, and ground sausage in their signature pie makes me think lasagna, not pizza. I'm a firm believer that less is more on a pizza. A deep dish pizza takes the exact opposite stance -that more is more and even more is even better.    Service was very good, but waiting up to 40 minutes for a pizza is a bit absurd. There may be a line out the door at night but that's more because it takes so long to serve each table. You're committing to over an hour which isn't economical if you're on a lunch break. Is it worth a visit? I would say yes just to try it out, but I'm not sure how many times I'll be returning.",

The sausage and sauce were very good but I didn't like the crust at all. To me it was very flat and hard. Idk if this is how it is suppose to be or what but it wasn't what I thought it would be.",

Unfortunately, it was just overhyped. I tried both the thick and thin crust pies here on different occasions. It is very expensive and the way you wait and order is unusual. Both myself and another friend who went on his own agreed that the business model probably works well in Chicago, but in Phoenix, people are not willing to wait for food like that. We also agreed that the pizza just isn't that great. For me, I find the stewed tomatoes do not have the appeal or the texture of a great tomato sauce on a pizza that I would rather eat. I have seen plenty of great reviews for this place and I just don't get it.",

Our server gave us a little cool backstory on how they got their crust just right and had to use special water systems to imitate Chicago Water from Lake Michigan. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff and amazing food!!! On our way out, we decided to pickup a frozen pie to-go for later. They were having some trouble with their credit card machine and after a few failed attempts, the manager just smiled and said, This one's on us!!! Amazing service, blew my expectations away, we will continue to make the journey from East Mesa every time I want REAL PIZZA!!!!",

The atmosphere was nice..the place was quite busy, but we got seated fairly quickly.  We had a big nice T.V. located right in front of our booth..which was a nice to have. I ordered a well margarita...and that too was perfect! We ordered the \"Chicago Classic\" & OMG one of the best decisions in my life lol. It was brought to our table and the gentleman served each one of us. The flavor of each ingredient was of high quality and well put together. That sauce was the die for....literally the best! Highly suggest this pizzeria. Also, our server Nancy was very attentive and sweet. She made great conversation. The teeny weency downfall to this place was that it was kinda warm, but given the amount of people in there I'm sure contributed to that; not to mention it's like 115 in Phoenix today. Overall, a perfect 5 stars & will for sure be back for this perfect slice of sweet sweet heaven.",

I DO NOT like the crust which is like a breakfast biscuit--dry with no taste.  Made worse by the fact it was still raw--they pulled it out of the oven too soon--it was a busy day.  I was going to complain to the manager but oh well--there were enough goodies in this deep dish to make me happy.  I might go back but if you do better make sure it is on an off day.

If you take a bite of just the crust itself it quickly turns to a mushy flour paste in your mouth.  We ordered a chicago style cheese with garlic and basil.

The host was super nice, we expected to have to wait in a long line and we were pleased at being seated right away, and our server was also very sweet and helpful. We were told that pizzas were taking 45 minutes so we might want to order a starter. We went with the combination platter, which was a mess of fried stuff: mozzarella sticks, cheddar bites, mushrooms and zucchini. This tasted like something dumped out of a freezer bag, fried, and then heated under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. Both cheese varieties were hard as a rock on the outside and strangely dry and flavorless on the inside. The mushrooms were unpleasant and the zucchini was about what you might expect from maybe a Tastee Freez. (Oh, who am I kidding, Tastee Freez zucchini is delicious.) We sent it away without eating much of any of it. Then the pizza came. It smelled great, but that was about it. The bottom crust was not quite cooked all the way and was nearly indistinguishable from the cheese, which was chewy and lacked flavor. My first piece had almost NO sauce, and some flabby pepperoni. I ate part of once slice and then tried a second slice that looked like it actually had some sauce. The sauce was good, but that was about it. All in all I ate about a half a slice of a small pizza. We spent almost $40 on some over-friend junk you could get at a fast food place and pizza that we barely ate. It was quite a disappointment. Obviously, we won't be back.",

I find it hard to believe but the waiter explained it to me this way.  Malnati's does not use garlic, onion, oregano, basil or other flavorings in their in their tomato topping. It is just smashed tomatoes.  I pointed out that my pizza was awash in moisture.  The sausage or meat on top was swimming in liquid and tasted like it had been boiled or steamed.  The waiter went on to explain that unlike the pizza sauce I was accustomed to, Malnati's does not cook their tomatoes and boil off excess moisture.  I did like the crust.  The pizza, itself, was so flavorless there is no way this this food has an Italian heritage.  It tasted like English food BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.  This was not my first experience with Chicago pizza.  My dad is from Chicago and we always ate pizza on our visits.",

However, once seated the service was not at all what I expected. They are lucky they are Lou Malnati's and that I was a huge fan from the Midwest and ecstatic to eat their pizza or the service would have been unacceptable. After being seated and having already pre-ordered the pizza the server was left with very little to do except to bring our drinks and food when it was ready. We ordered 3 waters and more than 5 minutes had passed and we still did not get our drinks. At this point it was going on 9pm and the crowed was slowing, there were even open tables! I asked the bartender for water and FINALLY almost 10 minutes later a different server brought over our water. Our server was not very present throughout the entire experience. Everything was extremely slow and we had to wait and ask multiple times for everything.  This is not what I expected from Lou Malnati's. The pizza was also subpar. It was not as thick as the pizza in Chicago and there was not nearly enough sauce on the pizza. I really hope things change as this is a place I would eat at every time I visited Chicago. Maybe Lou Malnati's in Phoenix cannot match up to the Chicago reputation. I will definitely wait a while before returning with hopes that the food and especially the service improves.",

    "text": "I'm from Chicago and lived 5 minutes from Lou's restaurant so I am a little picky when it comes to writing a review about my favorite place.  My first experience with Lou in AZ was to carry out a pizza because the line for dining when they opened was very, very long.  I ordered a classic original deep dish and a spinach one to go.  The classic was good but the spinach pizza had sliced tomatoes all over the top of the pizza and \"cheddar cheese\" underneath it.  That was not good.  Then last week we decided to try and eat at the restaurant so we went at 3:30 in the afternoon during the week.  Good time to go, only two couples in the restaurant eating.  I ordered calamari for an appetizer and it was over cooked.  They brought us another order that was cooked perfectly.  We then ordered the classic original deep dish pizza and I noticed it has pieces of sausage under the tomato sauce and NOT one solid piece of sausage.  I questioned the mgr and he agreed it was made incorrectly.  They waived our pizza on the bill which was very nice.  Living in the dessert also creates a bit of a problem with the dough rising.  The butter crust taste was there because they installed a special filtration system for the water but the crust wasn't as thick as it was back home. Lou has been open for 8 months and still has Chicago folks working at this restaurant.  I am hopeful they will be able to work out their issues  and make pizza again the way it should be made. If you want to send someone a pizza from Lou's, you must call the Chicago number to have it sent on dry ice.  They do not ship from the AZ location.  I did buy two frozen pizza's to take home and hope they are made correctly.",

I tried to order last week but was told they were not accepting delivery or carry out orders anymore.  Ordered online and the delivery was right on time. Ordered it uncut (per their recommendation).  The first thing I noticed was how watery the pizza was. It took about 5 sheets of paper towel to dab over the pizza and it was still soggy. Then my 2nd bite was into a chunk of bone, almost chipped my tooth.  From there it was just a rather bland tasting pizza.   Maybe my experience would have been better for dine in but the pizza that was delivered was a big fail... I think I'll stick to Oreganos",

The phone people are always courteous and polite and our food is served hot and ready. I saw some other reviews and I have to remind people that this isn't Little Caesar's or Papa John's. Their downtown restaurant is fantastic and to have this little place here close to us is wonderful.",

We waited almost 2 hours and we pre ordered 2 pizzas. The pre order system they have is great. The dough was flavorless and tasted as if it had been stretched in the morning and maybe frozen. The sauce and cheese weren't very hot and lacked any seasoning. The ambience is fun and great for families. Hopefully they work out some kinks because they have tons of potential in their location.",

Unfortunately, the excitement didn't last beyond the first bite of the personal sized pizza I had.  The crust was extremely hard and not flavorful at all.  My friend ended up getting a frozen pizza to take home for dinner that night and she and her husband said that crust was also really hard and tasted stale.  Obviously frozen isn't fresh, but it shouldn't be stale if they're still selling it.",

Had the pizza came out how we ordered my review would have probably been better because it was a good pizza. When the mistake was brought up to the waiter all he did for us is remove the fee for onion. We left dissapointed. His excuse was he could not find a manager. On a Monday evening? Really?

LOL).   When I sat down there were only three things that made me instantly sad; 1. No pink lemonade - WHY? 2. No Calamari - Lou's is my FAVE place to get Calamari. 3. The Menu is not the same as back home.  We were a party of 6 and Tisa was our server (She was FABULOUS! Even dealt with my sadness of the above very well). We got the Cheddar Cubes, and two House Salad's with ranch and Creamy Lemon Dressing, then for dinner we had a medium Malnati Chicago Classic, a small Malnati Chicago Classic with pepperoni (not my choice, but it was his first time here), the bowtie pasta, and the Malnati salad. Then for dessert we had the Trio - Cookie with ice cream, Tiramisu and Key Lime Pie, the Key Lime Pie needed to be more tart for me.   I cannot wait to go back on Friday for the soft opening and hopefully this time Mark will stop by our table!",

You will be completely disappointed if you are familiar with Chicago style pizza! It was a slow night, about half full at 5 pm. So they cannot blame the food for a busy night. The waitress never came to check on us with the pizza. I would have at least asked for oregano or Italian seasoning to doctor it up a little. I will not come back.... ever.

Stuffed into a corner of a strip mall, it's not exactly easy to find. I got a lunch plate which consisted of a side salad, a personal pizza, and a soft drink. I asked that the salad not come with onions, but it did anyway, and the server never noticed. The salad was also drowning in dressing, way too much, and way too strong. More or stronger doesn't equate to better. The personal pizza was pretty small, but for the price for the whole combination it was OK. With the meal and a 20% tip my lunch came to about $12.00. Seems a bit high to me for a pretty minimal meal.  As far as the ambience of the dining room, it's lit by some funky colored lighting that just didn't seem to compliment the space. There were 3 or 4 large screen TV's in there and they all had the same football game on. Guess the manager likes football.  I say go, and hopefully you'll get lucky and be more impressed than I was. It could have been a better experience.",

Today we came when they opened at 11 a.m. and were seated immediately. My entire family loved our deep dish pizzas, and this is why:  *Our server (Daniel) was from Chicago, and he gave us excellent advice. He recommended that we order the pizzas well-done, which meant the crust was crispy instead of soggy. He also recommended the garlic butter crust, as well as adding pepperoni to the not-too-spiced sausage.  *We learned that Lou's recreates that special Lake Michigan water, instead of using Phoenix water in the crust. They also use tomatoes and mozzarella from the same special providers they have used for 40+ years. Obviously, Lou's cares that their finished product tastes just as good as what you would find in Chicago. *The pizzas were simply delicious. We also tried the three cheese garlic bread, since the pizzas take about 30 minutes to bake and we wanted an appetizer. (Yeah, we're kinda stupid. Cheesy garlic bread before deep dish pizza is carb overload, but I have to say - it was terrific!)  Since we live out in Mesa, I guess I should say I'm sad that this place is so far from our house. But maybe it's for the best, as we might want to come here too often!",

I went against my better judgement and decided last night would be a \"cheat night\" and I would treat myself. I ordered the bowtie pasta with vodka sauce and sausage. I LOVE everything this dish has to offer and was really excited.  The flavor was great - which is always a plus. But overall, I was pretty disappointed and completely regret getting this dish. The flavor was literally the only thing it had in its favor. The pasta was WAY over cooked. I understand this place is known for its pizza, but that doesn't mean the pasta should be put on the back burner. I couldn't even get my bowtie pasta on my fork without it falling apart and slipping back into the bowl. The texture was just mush. It didn't help that the sauce was soupy. So it wouldn't even stick to the already mushy pasta. I was basically eating soup. My boyfriend got the fettuccini Alfredo and it had ZERO taste. He had to load it with cheese, salt and pepper to finally get some substance to it. At least his noodles were cooked correctly, though. What a disappointment for a day I would finally eat pasta again, not to mention a waste of money.",

I was always wanting to go visit Chicago just for the deep dish and heard that LM is big up there. The week before I was about to order their pizza online to be shipped. Glad I didn't. I just bought a cheapy ice chest and bought a couple of frozen pizza to take back to CA.  Now about the pizza. Pizza is pretty good but a little pricey. I can tell the ingredients are fresh. It is the butter crust that makes this pizza a winner. Went to dinner their a couple of times. I don't  know if LM is the real deal since their are probably a few better ones out in Chicago but this is good enough for me since Deep Dish pizza is not something you eat all the time.",

We started with the cheese bread, a delicious warm garlic bread. The marinara was scaldingly hot, but still good. Ordered the small original and our server put in for a personal accidentally. It was still one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time.  Meh, these things happen. She fixed the order, let us eat the personal and apparently gave us a decent discount. David said I am a cheap date. How romantical.",

When we arrived on a Wednesday around 8pm there was no line and it wasn't very busy.   We came hungry and ordered a combination of their fried appetizers followed up with the deep dish cheese pizza.  The appetizers were no different than would you should expect from any sports bar and the pizza wasnt much better. I'm not sure  if it had been sitting for a while but the cheese wasn't hot and stretchy as we served ourselves a piece. It was slightly warmer than room temperature and was just meh. Probably not going back considering the cost for a less than stellar pizza.",

Obviously you are coming here for the pizza right?  Well they bring it.  We ordered the Malnati Chicago classic which is sausage, extra cheese and butter crust.  They press ot the sausage so it is like a huge sausage patty that covers the whole pizza.  Sausage and extra cheese in every bite.  Now that does not suck.  Pizza comes out literally bubbling hot.  Oreganos was the \"go to\" pizza place...  now...  think I'm coming back here. Easily top 3 pizzas in AZ",

    "text": "This place was recommended by a friend who lived in Chicago and said, \"this place has the best deep dish in AZ!\" I took his word and decided to give this place a shot.   You know when you arrived at this location when you see a bright Lou Malnati's sign. When you walk in your greeted immediately by a cute hostess girl who promptly looks for seating. As your waiting you'll notice that the restaurant has a really nice layout, a full bar, patio seating with fire place and the decor on the walls were neat to look at.   Here are my list of con's. One, my friend and I requested to be seated by the fire place which seats were available at that time. Our hostess agreed and said, \"she would get the table ready for us\". Sweet! Well due to a lack of communication, another staff member didn't check in and sat a couple before us in the seats we requested first. Our hostess apologized and sat us somewhere else. No biggie but would have been nice.   Secondly, I don't suggest ordering the Twisted lemonade from their cocktail menu. It just tasted like diluted Gatorade with no liquor. It wasn't worth $8.95. In my opinion this cocktail needed fresh squeezed lemons, a shot of vodka, perhaps a shot of Grand Marnier and mint leafs as a garnish. Boom! I just made that shit up.   Now last but not least the Pro's. After, not being seated in the requested table. The manager did apologize, offered to take off our appetizer off the bill, and a free desert. Cool! However, the appetizer still remained on the bill and I didn't want to say anything because I'm not at the position to remove it of my check. Whatever! I still paid for the Calamari which was delicious. Also, the deep dish pizza was THE BOMB!!    Overall, the experience was decent, our waiter was informative and suggested some things on the menu. I really would like to give this place a 4 but a 3 was deserved. I definitely will return hopefully for a better experience because their pizza is truly AMAZING.",

Tried their deep dish chicago classic pizza with sausage and mushrooms (extra sauce). The thick crust was way too overwhelming. It definitely took away flavor instead of adding flavor to the pizza. The pizza tasted quite bland to me. For all the extra calories I'm getting from a deep dish, it better be out of this world good if I'm going to come back for more!! With that said, I will be back to try some of their other menu items when my bf has his deep dish craving.",

We sat outside on the patio - the misters are great. Our salad came quickly and the pizza was cooked to perfection. My Lou's \"pro tip\" is to be sure to ask for your sausage crumbled - the sausage in patty form is a bit overpowering.   For those who are concerned about the 30-45 min pizza cook time, you can call ahead and have your pizza started before you come (if you're in a rush and don't want to sit and enjoy an iced tea or an ice cold beer). :)",

It was made just right and honestly I felt that it may have been better than giordanos. The second time was a completely different story!! What did it for me was The pizza was totally soggy and MOIST (ugh that word) even though I ordered it WELL DONE. I'm sorry but it literally killed the whole vibe for me. It didn't taste good either, and like I said it was like I was trying to hold a hosed down loaf of bread. It was completely falling apart and what I had was a pizza soup instead of an actual pizza. I almost threw it away because if I wanted soup I woulda just went to Panera bread or something. Of course I just ate it anyways because nobody, NOBODY throws pizza out especially when it's national pizza day.   So there you have it, I think both giordanos and Lou malnatis are just ok-not great-Chicago style pizzas. It isn't worth it for the price either.   Staff is super friendly though!",

He offered to remake, I accepted and picked up the replacement pie 30 minutes later.  2nd time was no better. Tasted like a frozen one was heated up for us.

    "text": "When you live in a deep-dish desert like yours truly, sometimes you've got to take drastic measures to check this pizza off a bucket list.  The journey to get to that point began thus: with a call to place a reservation, a chirpy instruction to pre-order the pizza before arrival at the restaurant, said pre-order taking place, a walk into a restaurant in the middle of an enormous parking lot, and an entrance to what looked like an enormous beer hall with a decidedly inferior \"outer\" restaurant with bar seating. Lofty ceilings, tall pitchers of beer, and dim lights are the order of the day at this Phoenix outpost of famed Lou Malnati's.  While waiting for your food, study the animated families and marvel at the sheer size and weight of these deep dish pans. The service is familiar and responsive - no stiffness to be had here - all easygoing acquiescence.   The bruschetta comes on thickly cut toasted bread - less hardy than a ciabatta and a focaccia, and reminiscent of those pillowy Italian loaves one finds at Costco's or a Shaw's. There's no fault here post-toast, because the slices are piled so high with diced tomatoes that you don't notice. The Malnati salad was actually the star - \"This salad is amazing!\" - my emphatically vegetable-hating college-age brother proclaimed. With romaine, red onions, salty bits of salami, and tomatoes, and the best part - a sweet vinaigrette, he wasn't wrong.  And so comes the crowning glory - a monstrosity of a jet black pan with what looked like 10 pounds of signature Malnati's buttery crust, extra cheese, sausage, and a thickly spread sauce on top. Don't be intimidated by the size, you won't need to lift a finger, since chirpy service will slice and serve. Get a shot of that cheese pull and don't miss it like I did.  The slice is near faultless - what makes the Malnati's slice gorgeous is that buttery crispy crust - with plenty of red sauce and extra cheese and plump chunks of spicy sausage, you barely notice the somewhat anemic dough underneath the crunch of a golden crust. To counter this, perhaps ask for the crust to be extra baked-through and the dough won't be that just barely done texture underneath.   Delicious food and pleasant service!",

It is delicious, as is the medium cheese Deep Dish. But you must... order their Lou's Salad. It was outstanding and better than any other salad we've had, even better than CPK's Chopped!  Negatives are still the uneven service. For instance the Dip Trio appetizer arriving with our pizzas. Our server tried to say they timed it like that. Yeah okay, I'll bite, why was it cold then?  Oops.   It was nice to see our previous server from Lincoln Park is now one of the Managers. Great hire and promotion!  Anyway, nothing negative can detract from the really good Chicago comfort food of Lou's.   Enjoy!",

The PIZZA now: we went with people who have eaten it several times and another person who is from Chicago...they all said with great disappointment that this is not the same Lou's they are familiar with in Chicago. The crust/cheese ratio was way off basically. Maybe to those who don't know what it's supposed to taste like it is great, but to those who know what it's supposed to be like its def not worth the 1.5 hour wait (2 weeks after opening by the way).",

We chose to sit outside and enjoy the still cool May evening. Unfortunately, we were seated on the orange chairs vs the robin's egg blue ones. They sit too low to eat comfortably. They might be good for having a beer on the patio, but for eating they're about 4 inches too low for the table. I'm also am thinking that they're going to need some more umbrellas for the Arizona sun. Chicago doesn't have 325 sunny days a year so it doesn't look like they're prepared for the shade that Arizonans enjoy. However does have a couple nice misters that'll make up for it. Place is beautiful. They have take out frozen pizzas which I'll definitely put the use. I wonder when they'll get into the supermarkets. Staff has been incredibly friendly as this is their first day of being open and looking forward to a pizza I've missed since moving here and only been able to get close to with our local Oregano's. The Coors Light beer was flat and I am surprised they do not offer a few more Chicago beers on the menu. I will be back and I hope I can improve my experience as their experience increases.",

It basically tasted like a hunk of cheese strings with bread and a touch of sauce. I don't think it was cooked quite enough.  It had very little sauce with only 2 pepperonis on each slice.  What makes thin NY style better is the even distribution (typically) of ingredients.   Chicago deep dish, at least at this place is all cheese with barely any tomato sauce.

I said  make it 7:30 and so I showed up 5 minutes before and as I walked toward the building,WHAT, it looked like a concert line with 60 people deep. I walked around the line and got my pizza and went home. I turned on my STL cards game I had taped earlier and enjoyed the 1st bite of many. Holy Sheeeet this pizza is rock star great! The flavor of all the ingredients is #1 and if you go tell them Billyray's  sent you. No doubt it will be my new favorite pizza joint in town. I'm for the most part I'm a pizza snob and the Phx area is not known for killer pizza spot.   Some of my go to spots for kick azz flavor are about 3.  One is Pizzafarro's in Cave creek another Red Devil and the last is up in Prescott next St Michaels now this is my favorite it is call  Genovese\"s WOW WOW and Mainati's you might just kick the door down.

Unfortunately the waiting area is not very big and does not have much seating, so we stood for the entire time. Also, they had garage-style doors by the bar that were open letting in the 108 degree heat, so we were hot and uncomfortable the whole wait. We ordered our pizza ahead of time and we're finally seated. We started with the Malnati's salad, which was very good. The dressing was sweet, it had crispy salami bits, gorgonzola cheese, mushrooms, olives and tomatoes. Definitely try this salad!!! We also tried the spinach stuffed bread, which was good but not really a very large portion for four people to share. We had the Malnati's Chicago classic pizza, medium size, and we all had enough. The sauce is very simple, tomato and garlic, probably salt. It's delicious and rich. I could eat it plain. The crust was thinner than I expected, but so good! Almost pastry-like. The service was good. We enjoyed our food, but the wait was uncomfortable and unorganized. I don't mind waiting, but at least provide a comfortable place for your customers to wait.",

    "text": "Placed an online order around noon for pickup at 5:30, because I KNEW this place was gonna be jam packed... expecially since it was the grand opening! I bypassed the crazy line that wrapped around the building and went straight to the pick up counter. I was worried that it was going to be chaotic (and it was!) but within 3 minutes my piping hot pizzas were in my hands and I was out the door. I was born and raised in Chicago, so I knew how Malnati's is supposed to taste. This did NOT disappoint!! Oh my gosh I didn't know how much I missed that sauce until the salty, savory, tomato-y flavor exploded in my mouth. Soooooo gooooood!! Make sure to ask for more pizza sauce, as it's perfect for dipping that amazing buttercrust in. I'll eventually dine in, but probably not for a couple of months. This place is gonna be poppin' for awhile.",

    "text": "I ate at one of the Chicago locations a few years ago and loved it. When I saw they were opening one in Phoenix, I was excited but apprehensive that it wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Went in this Sunday night and got into a very long line of people waiting to get in. Some people were bailing because of the line, but we decided to stick it out. It probably took 15-20 minutes to get to the front where you put your name in. During that wait, they had people walking through the line handing out little pieces of their thin pizza and it was excellent. It's also a great way to keep people waiting by teasing them with the food they're going to get inside.   After putting my name in they said it would be an hour to an hour-ten minute wait. They take your phone number and send you a text when you're up and they also have a link in the text message so you can see your place in queue, which is pretty cool. Even better, when you put your name in, you can tell them what pizza you want so you don't have to wait a second time once you're seated. It ended up being about 90 minutes before we were seated and because of the pre-order, our deep dish pizza was at the table less than 10 minutes after we were seated, which is awesome.   As for the food, we had a deep dish pepperoni pizza, the combination platter appetizer and I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich to go (breakfast!). Everything was really good and a large deep dish is easily enough for 4 people, maybe more. We had a party of three and took home almost half the pizza. The service was also excellent and our server was very friendly and helpful as were the various hosts and staff that greeted and seated everyone. Definitely going to be going back as often as possible and you should too.",

Pepperoni and sausage go really well with the buttered crusted pizza. My only complaint is the very sweet tomato they use for the sauce. That has an overwhelming flavor compared to others. But ya it keeps them apart from other joints. Sidenote be ready to wait a good one hour if you are looking for tables. I always do take out; still the pizza is hot and fresh.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Full disclosure, former Chicagoan.  The location on Rush in River North was my go-to.  This location holds up and after all these years, still rises above the competition.  Waited in line for 2 hours today.  Yes, I'm crazy.  For food.  Lou Mal's in particular.  I'd been waiting for this place to open ever since I heard the news last year.    Wife and I ordered some beers and a large Classic.  Saw a ton of people leave with to-go orders and leftovers of the thin crust and I wonder what they were thinking.  If you come to Lou Malnati's, you come for Chicago deep dish.  Everything else pales in comparison.  Got to meet Marc Malnati after dinner, which was awesome.  He is, genuinely, one of the nicest guys you will ever meet.  Told him the truth - that Geno's was my first but that ultimately I fell in love with Lou Mal's.    So in the hierarchy of Chicago deep dish, Lou Malnati's - Geno's East - Pizzeria Uno/Due (the original two).  Stick with the deep dish.  You can do either sausage or pep, but the sausage just works so darn well with the rest of the pizza.  Give in to the carbs, and the calories, and the cholesterol.",

    "text": "Lou Malnati's is known for their deep dish pizza - and it is the best I've ever had. This is Lou's first location they have ever built outside of Chicago, and I reallllly hope they expand to Vegas.   This location is TINY. I'm talking maybe 20 tables inside and 20 outside on the patio. The dining room is so small we couldn't bring the stroller in because it's a fire hazard. We showed up around noon shortly after they opened so there was no wait, but I can imagine it gets very crowded during dinner time so PLAN AHEAD!     Their signature pizza is The Malnati Chicago Classic which has lean Italian sausage, lots of gooey mozzarella cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes all on a delicious buttery deep dish crust. The sausage is formed into a disc and placed onto the crust so you get sausage in every bite! Then the yummy cheese and tomatoes are added and it's off to the oven where it takes about 30 minutes or so to bake.   Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ordered a salad, meatballs, a large pizza and a beef sandwich. Since the pizza takes a while we enjoyed the meatballs and salad first. The Malnati salad had chopped salami, gorgonzola cheese cubes, mushrooms, and black olives. It comes with a sweet vinegarette dressing which I don't care for, but the lemon garlic dressing is delightful as well as the house vinegarette. The beef sandwich is tasty, piled high with thinly sliced beef, giardiniera, and au jus on the side for dipping. The meatballs were good too but the star of the show for me is the pizza.   If you are ever in the Phoenix area do yourself a favor and check this place out. And if you can't make it, you can order their pizza online to be shipped frozen to your house.",

I often am disappointed in the end product when someplace has been hyped so much.  I expected that here.  I prepped myself for the \"Ok, it's ok - but I don't get the hype\" feeling as I paid the check.  We took our first bites, looked at each other ... and each of us mouthed the word \"WOW\" ... I relished every. single. bite. EVERY. ONE. I was sad there wasn't more to take home with me to relive the experience the next day.  I think next time I'll insist to order a large JUST FOR ME ... so I can make sure I have leftovers the next day.  (Provided they're not devoured during the ride home...)  Other things on the menu?  We did do the three cheese bread.  Perfect.  Were there other things on the menu?  I dunno... why would I look for more?  I may have to figure that out in the future.  But - know this.

Of course we had to go, and the line was long, just like it is in Chicago.  However, they have this great gadget that sync's up to your phone and it tells you what number in line you are, and the anticipated wait time.  You can browse around and not stand in a crowded restaurant waiting to be seated.  We did find a place at the bar during our wait and we were served quickly and were not neglected so the 45 minute wait went fast.  We pre-ordered our pizza after check-in so our two deep dish pizzas were ready within minutes after we were seated.  Genius.  Number 1:  The service is great, despite the wait.  The staff are very friendly and efficient. Number 2:  I love the deep dish pizza and the flavors; my husband could take it or leave it.  Everyone has their own tastes on pizza, and for me, it hits the spot.  I live across town so we won't visit too often, but it's definitely on the list when we want something special.",

    "text": "You know that old adage , 'It's not you, it's me...' ? That's the case with Lou Malnati's Pizza I have decided after this past weekend. Following my last review of Lou Malnati's, the company reached out to me and followed with a nice 'try us again' gift. I am usually on the fence about mentioning such things in a review , as who's to say someone looking for something for gratis won't write a crappy review for that, after reading that in my review. I do believe, THOSE people exist.. sadly. I am not one of those people. I work in an industry where customer service and keeping people happy is key to return business and the success of a company in the long haul. Often, when a place reaches out , ( like the one place who ignored my food allergies and served me nuts anyway ! ), I don't give a second chance.. especially if it's truly bad, (or as I just mentioned, me or my families health is involved). Lou's was not that way. I truly believed the first time, they were maybe having an off night. I decided to take them up on their offer of 'trying them again'. Maybe my taste buds were off that first time and we did order late into the evening, last time, as well. This time, I decided to give Lou Malnati's my entire, FULL, attention. I decided to dine in their full service restaurant and experience the full Monty, if you will. My review is not going up, in stars though, as there were things that I feel were better and some that I think, were not where they should be. A 4 star is on point with most things and a 5 star is near perfection service to taste to experience overall. That is my own Yelp grading scale. FWIW. This night, we were sat immediately by a super friendly hostess. The restaurant was not busy... yet. That changed in about forty minutes! We started with wine , but my husband knowing the Chicago area asked for an Old Style. He opted to switch to that off hand. It was not on the menu, and they had it. Not something I would drink , but okay! I decided to ask for a sparkling wine.. also, NOT on the menu, but they had a La Marca Prosecco. Interesting. I had to wonder what else wasn't listed on the wine/beer/drink menu. We were famished and ordered the Calamari Fritti. To me, it had no taste. Just bland. The marinara sauce for dipping was served cold too and I have a thing about that. The sauce should be hot for the hot calamari. We also ordered two pizzas: one small Lou's , we added sausage to this ; and one medium thin crust sausage / pepperoni to which we added roma tomatoes; olives and mushrooms. The pizzas showed up hot and looking amazing. They are cut right at your table. I think I've decided it's the crust that turns me off to this place. I don't like it's taste and it doesn't seem fresh, because of the lack of crisp to it. I will say that the deep dish pizza, The Lou's pizza, was a lot better over all than last time. It's definitely a filling pizza, as we were full off of a slice of it.. the thin crust was just , blah. I should have not attempted a thin crust pizza in a Chicago pizza eatery, because I do have my favorite 'thin' crust pizza places in the valley. This pizza left me unimpressed. As far as service went, I felt our wait staff, a girl who was training a guy, was very good at the beginning and then... faltered. We still had pizza on our plates and wine in our glass and we were being asked if we wanted dessert or boxes. That will ALWAYS give the feeling of wanting a guest to be done ( because it was now very busy), and get out! Soon, the check arrived and her asking if I had my coupon that I mentioned upon ordering. That was it. Again, I think Lou Malnati's is located in a great area.. has a great vibe.. could probably still work on service, as the end of our meal seemed rushed and like a 'churn and burn' situation on a busy night, which lead to us feeling like we had taken too long. The taste is not likely so much the fault of any thing else, than my own dislike and taste buds. Like I said, Lou, it's not really you .. it's me. I do love that HR or management reached out to attempt to make things right last time.. but, a company can do that a million times and if the core players , (i.e. wait staff , etc), aren't on the service game, it won't do much good .. especially with someone like me who's on the wire about the taste already. I truly wanted to love you ... but this is mere 'sort of , not really feeling it ' zone for me .",

We did forget to order extra cheese, the way we always ordered in Chicago, but other than that, it tasted great. There are few good New York style pizza joints here, but We've missed good Chicago pizza.   We did have to send some glass and silverware back, lipstick and dried food crusties, so they need to work on paying attention to that.  They loose one star for this. The food, the atmosphere, and employees attitudes were 5 star worthy.   It was a great pleasure to meet Marc. Being a Chicago celebrity, he's as down to earth and genuine as it gets.",

This indeed was your first location when you popped your cherry in AZ and your absolutely crushing it!  I mean c'mon what's not to like about your tomatoey, cheesy Chicago Classic?!  Your buttahrific crust is really good and sets the standard for a deep dish pie.  I'm so looking forward to stopping by to give you more of my money once again.  Please help me get the bad taste out of my mouth after some Jack-O named Gus gave me gas at some other chop shop pie shop!  But enough about that disaster!    Congrats on your upcoming second full service restaurant location in Scottsdale.  But oh please don't ever change that crustless pizza that my friend raves about that I need to try.  Thank you so much for offering that as an option for folks looking to downsize their spare tires and buns.  Oh by the way, just an FYI Lou, there is already an exotic Sausage Fest being served in that part of town your headed to.  But they got nothing on your lean seasoned sausage topping.  Wherever you are in deep dish heaven you should be oh so proud of what your family has accomplished.  Do you Lou do you!  RIP.  Rest In Pie.    Regards,  -David Burro",

If I wasn't traveling and I were going to be in the area I would come back because I know that the lasagna and everything has got to be just as great...

We ordered the Chicago classic deep dish with butter crust and added pepperoni. There is a ton of cheese on their pizza but I'm never gonna complain about too much cheese. Sausage and pepperonis were flavorful. Crust was buttery and crispy. Just a heads up, don't come here if you are in a rush. These deep dish pizzas take some time in the oven. I would say that it took at least 35-40 minutes to get our pizza. Mozzarella sticks were awesome too! Their ranch dressing is fantastic on them and on the pizza too. They have a nice outdoor patio with misters as well. I would definitely return for some authentic deep dish!",

    "text": "So excited that Lou Malnatis, my favorite Chicago pizza has come to Phoenix! Thick pizza is amazing. If you haven't tried it, try it. Don't compare it to Thin NY pizza, because they're different and both amazing. For NY pizza, I love pepperoni. But for Chicago pizza, sausage all the way. You get a single layer of sausage, so every bite has sausage. It's so good.   It's so thick that one slice will fill you up. You will use a knife and fork. You cannot hold it up and fold it in half.   Their house salad is the perfect supplement to their pizza. Try them together. This location is in the plaza with Shake Shack and other food spots. The neon lights are so bright and inviting. There's a large eating area, and carry out is also available. However pizzas do take 30 min so call ahead of time.",

When they opened a restaurant in Phoenix we were there on opening day and have returned frequently since even though it's an hour across town. Their deep dish pizza is the benchmark for all others.  We have another Chicago-based pizza restaurant closer to home and tried it--no comparison.  Lou Malnati's is absolutely the best. We get a large pepperoni and mushroom with extra cheese.  Two pieces and we are toast! We take the rest home and enjoy it again. Yum!",

After we were seated it took a very long time to even get acknowledged we have our drink order to the waiter and it took over 10 minutes to get are drinks. when I got mine it was diet. had to ask someone else to fix it because once again he disappeared still waiting to place our meal now almost 25 minutes passed and he come back. He seemed very annoyed because we never been here and has a few questions. We placed our order LG Pan extra cheese extra pepperoni easy sauce. our pizza came out and it was awful the bottom was very soggy and doughy could never find our waiter to let him know. we ate 2 slices out of it. Check was brought and we told him the issue and he said want me to box it up. we both laughed and said no it not eatable. no sorry let me get the manager nothing left our check paid no tip and left. hungry and went out to get a real pizza we could eat. waited a lot of money and a lot of time for nothing.",

We had the deep dish and appetizers and enjoyed our visit. Would have been nicer if the sauce had more of a spice kick, while it was fresh it was not a unique sauce that you would find in New York. Takes a long trip to get there from Maricopa. If they were closer would try the thin crust pizza. Comparing it to scillian pizza back east not as much flavor and softer crust. Nice for a change of pace. Though very good, but I've had much better where you couldn't stop eating the pizza. This is a totally fresh enjoyable pizza that is worth trying for yourself!",

I walk up to a mall I had been to several times to find a hidden gem in the corner.... the hidden pepperoni on the pizza.... the saucy sauce of all sauces.... my family is waiting for me on the patio and come running up to me in their Italian Chicago embrace so happy to be in a place that feels like a slice of home. We order the deepest of deep dish pizzas- and were greeted with the largest pizza pie of cheesy saucy goodness my eyes have beheld. And boom with one bite upon my fragile taste buds into the endless sauce abyss--- there I was in Chicago- back in the bustling town eating a favorite slice of my Chicago pizza.... so thank you Lou Malnatis for giving me a traditional slice of deep dish pizza- and for being cheaper than a plane ticket.... yummy food, fun environment and atmosphere, and for letting me gorge myself on your cheesy cheesy goodness",

The things that have been consistent are long wait, bland pizza, and some sort of mistake made by the staff that is rectified by free appetizers.  There are a number of stories I could tell about this restaurant and are different experiences. I've been there by myself, I went with my family twice, and I went with a big group once. I would not recommend ever going to this restaurant with a big group. Yes they are busy and that's a good thing. But they have yet to figure out how to manage large groups. For the most part they should simply say they don't seat groups of that size. For instance, we were a group of 14 and waited two hours for a table.  Again, not a problem if they tell you up front and ultimately seat you at an appropriate table but that has not been my experience.    The pizza seems like it is going to be great but in a town with Pizzeria Bianco you gotta bring your A game.  I've been to Chicago a number of times and these pizzas are a far cry from the wonderful flavors of that City.    The staff always tries to make up for shortcomings.  They are attentive and pretty friendly.  They seem to be trying hard to make up for bad situations but at some point only so much can be done.",

I decided to keep things simple and get a medium cheese pizza.  I have had variations of deep dish pizza at places like Nello's and the late, great Zachary's in Tucson. I thought I knew what to expect. Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed when the pizza arrived. It was a very doughy pizza with a load of somewhat cooked tomatoes dumped on top of a surprisingly small amount of cheese with what seemed little to no sauce under the cheese. I found the tomatoes that they put on top of it to be inedible, and I cannot say I cared for what was underneath either.   I felt obligated to try at least two of the slices, but it was far from an enjoyable experience. There were four slices left, and I contemplated not taking them home. If there had been a homeless person around, I would have happily given the leftovers to them. I ultimately decided to the throw the leftovers away.  I think if I was going to get pizza this thick again, I would go somewhere that served Sicilian style pizza. At least that has plenty of cheese and sauce. Needless to say, I will not be going back here again.",

It may be Chicago's best, but it is definitely one of Arizona's worst.   If you want amazing deep dish, hit up Vito's in central Phoenix. It puts this place to shame.",

I live around the corner from Lou's and order take out about once a week. Every pizza is perfect - legit haven't had a bad pizza yet.   Again, just have to give a big shout out to these guys. They opened the right way and doing it correct. No 2 hour wait, no water-ness at the bottom of the dish (YUCK!). Seriously go read Gio's reviews and make the route to Lou's instead",

    "text": "I've been to Lou's three times and am reviewing my most recent experience last night.    The two other times I've visited with my husband, I would rate 4 stars.  Yes - you have to wait for the pizza quite awhile but you have to just expect that here.   Last night was another story.  We decided to bring my dad here on Superbowl night for his birthday celebration.  The place was pretty empty and we sat on the patio.  There were 5 adults and 2 toddlers.   The service was very spotty, at best.  I don't know if there wasn't enough staff (although there seemed to be plenty of servers walking around everywhere) or what but it was horrible.  Our girl took FOREVER to do everything.    We ordered a few appetizers to start.  The calamari was excellent. Then, we had our appetizer plates stacked with used silverware to take away before our pizza came.  Well, our server came over and then asked if we could take the stack of forks back to use for our pizza.  WHAT??? They were used and there was no way we could figure out which one was whose!  We said we were sorry and asked if she could bring us more forks.  She seemed a little annoyed.   Then, we proceeded to wait for our pizza.  And wait. And wait.  I think we waited at least an hour.  It finally came.  We ordered (2) - one of the regular sausage special and a pepperoni.  And it was luke-warm.  I really like my food hot but this was not even close to hot.  But, we were all so hungry we just ate it.  I wondered if maybe it was left there for awhile after watching our server during the rest of our visit.   After the pizza, we had some leftovers - which she offered to box up.  She took the pizza with her and didn't come back for 15 minutes!  At least.  Then, when she did come back into view, with our pizza in hand, she managed to stop at 3 other tables to do various tasks before coming back to ours - all holding our pizza.   Then, we just wanted to pay the check and get out of here.  She finally dropped the check, and we quickly gave her our card to pay.  Another 15 minutes passed.  She finally returned - again stopping at 2-3 other tables on our way back to ours!  It was quite ridiculous, I have to say.    I will really think twice before coming back here - or maybe we will just get our pizza to go next time!",

    "text": "My review is based on one lunch time visit and I note I've never been to Chicago and am not the most familiar with Chicago style pizza.  Lou Malnati's is a full service Restaurant and Bar with Carry Out. They are famous for the Chicago Deep Crust Pizza but also offer thin crust pizza, pasta, soup, salad, sandwiches and more.   They offer patio seating and in-door seating in a fun retro kind of atmosphere with interesting fixtures and bright lights that spell out \"Cheese\".  We got seated quickly but it took a while to get waited on. My waiter apologies and told us nobody told him that he was seated. We ordered our lunch time pizzas and they took about forty minutes to arrive.  While I was waiting I grabbed a plate thinking I'd need a plate for the pizza. I thought at first my plate had soap residue but at closer inspection I noticed the finish has worn off in spots. Not sure how hygienic that might be........I also did notice the condiments seemed all well filled and clean.  I tried an individual all vegetable pizza called \"The Lou.\" It was made with grey spinach mix, fresh mushrooms, unripe roma tomatoes on the top, Lou's vine ripe tomatoes sauce, cheese blend on a very small deep dish garlic butter crust. I liked the cheese blend and the vine ripe tomatoes sauce, fresh mushrooms were very good. The crust was unlike any pizza crust I tasted before. The sides were very thin and very crisp and reminded me of crostata dough. The bottom was slightly thicker and seemed closer to a pizza dough. If I tried to make this dough at home I'd mix crostata dough with pizza dough together. I didn't get much of a butter flavor but the crust almost seemed like it was fried. To me the individual size was unusually small and is possibly the smallest size pizza I ever had out anywhere. I was actually able to finish a whole pizza...I never done that before and usually bring home half of an individual.  My husband had the Malnati Chicago Classic - that is Lou's lean sausage with vine ripened tomato sauce, cheese blend on the butter crust and one piece of pepperoni...(pepperoni might have been an accidental add on by kitchen?) The lean sausage was kind of dry without much flavor. My husband was still hungry after the tiny pizza and could have used an appetizer or salad with the pizza.  A different kind of pizza that is well loved by Chicago and makes Phoenix a little more interesting.  Worth a try!  3.5 stars",

The atmosphere is wonderful, we sat out side, and our server was attentive and provided stellar service. We will be back.",

They do charge you for extra ranch. It's 50 cents.   We also got the combination platter which is really good. I love the zucchini & cheddar bites!   They also have a bar.

I was introduced to their fabulous pizza back in 2013 when I was working in Chicago and had my first mouthwatering experience. Deep dish pizza is something I only treat myself to a few times a year, so I only go for the best.  Upon hearing that Lou's was coming to Phoenix, my excitement was off the charts. It's not exactly next door, but it's easy to rally friends or anyone from Chicago to come with.   The butter crust really sets Lou's pizza apart. We usually get the two classic style pizzas (Malnati and the Lou) which you can't go wrong with. If I were to only get one pizza, I would do The Lou and add their sausage. For a vegetarian pizza The Lou is pure excellence. The combination appetizer was quite good too.   I've found the staff to be very friendly and helpful at this location, and I really like the way they designed the place. If the weather is nice take advantage of the patio. Kids love the play area just outside the restaurant. It may not have the nostalgia that it does when you eat it in Chicago, but it's still delicious.",

    "text": "This was our first time trying Lou's! Really beautiful casual restaurant with a large patio. They have a nice bar when you walk in. Happy hour was from 3pm-6pm. We came in with 11 of us. They do not take reservations but luckily we got seated quickly. Pizza takes 30-45 minutes so make sure to get your order in as soon as you can. Our server was excellent so she was continuously checking in on us and answering questions. I think her name was Kiara.   We started with the buffalo wings. They come breaded/fried but we had the option to bake them instead(take a little longer). Both were extremely good! The wings were big and the sauce was very tasty. My family got a large Italian salad that they said was delicious and huge. It looked yummy.   Hubby and I have been doing a low carb Keto diet so we went with a \"Crustless pizza\". This is not on the menu but  the server said it wasn't a problem. They make the bottom crust with a large sausage patty and then add the cheese, marinara sauce, and your choice of topping which we did pepperoni. It was actually really good and super filling. Only need about 2 slices to fill you up so 2 people could share a small crustless pizza. It reminded me of mozzarella and marinara meatballs. Everyone else split a deep dish pizza and it all looked super delicious.   If you love Chicago style pizza, this is a great place to go! They have a ton of options on the menu for everyone to enjoy. Overall a great experience.",

    "text": "Oh Lou's... how I want to love you! We've been a few times since this location opened, in hopes that the staff would get more organized as time went on. Unfortunately, they just can't seem to get a rhythm going. We visited recently on a weekday night because we were in the middle of a kitchen renovation and desperate for real food. We'd tried the gluten-free crust in the past and were really unimpressed with it (mediocre texture and super small), so when my friend gave me a heads up about their \"meatza\" that's not on the menu, I was intrigued.   Before we could order, though, our server actually needed show up. My husband was so hangry that he nearly walked out, but I was starving and talked him into waiting a few more minutes. I had plenty of time to assess the staffing ratios, though: countless bussers (who all refused eye contact, so I couldn't ask about our server), multiple hosts (one possibly a manager), and... minimal waiters. Hmmm. I know the waitstaff needs to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, expediting and verifying orders, but part of a good host's job is tracking down waiters and making sure they're aware of all their assigned tables (especially if their section has been empty for awhile). Because the hosts were posted at the hostess stand with no view of the dining room or patio, I can't imagine they were organizing much at the front of the house.  But I digress - our waitress did eventually notice us, and had a sharp command of the menu. She happily explained the crustless pizza and recommended a medium for the two of us, which turned out to be WAY too much food (it's a dense sausage patty, so we weren't able to eat nearly as much as a typical pizza). She also steered us away from adding tomatoes as a topping, as good as it sounded - she explained what many of you yelpers described as the \"watery pizza\" phenomenon (as she'd advised, the actual sauce was plenty watery, especially without a crust to soak it up). I do wish we'd gone with more veggies to knock the saltiness down a peg - Lou's salads that I've tried are so-so, but a good salad alongside the meatza would have been a perfect balance. As for the ample leftovers - they were actually quite good cold the next day!  The rest of our dinner was fairly uneventful, though we got some free entertainment in people-watching and I nearly knocked over a busboy who was cleaning one of the restrooms (put a sign up or prop open the door next time?). We might try Lou's again in another year or so to see if they've stepped it up. You gotta be at the top of your game to survive in the central corridor!",

I am disappointed the bartender never took the time to take care of me and that she was never present behind the bar. I saw other people coming behind to make their drinks, maybe a team service thing? Just overall not the best service I could've received. Usually the bartenders at Lous are nice and chatty, however on this occasion I was very let down. Overall my food was great, just make sure you guys are doing a better job with service.",

It has always been a tie with Federal Pizza but I have decided that the buttery dough, delicious tasty sausage and tomato sauce is unparalleled, making Lou Malnatis my number one. I usually have my pizza delivered, and they always recommend cutting the pizza up in your house. I personally think it's better left in the oven a little longer - the dough gets crispy on the outside and super tender on the inside. One to two slices is usually enough for me as one slice would fill most people up. I always order the Deep Dish Malnati Chicago Classic. We ordered a couple of boxes one time for a house party, along with pizzas from other restaurants and most of the guests devoured Lou's pizza.   If you're not a fan of deep dish, their thin crust is pretty good as well. As far as appetizers, the Malnati Salad is delicious. That sweet vinaigrette would taste good on anything. The wings and the gorgonzala dip are scrumptious - I am definitely a fan.",

The sauce was extremely fresh and mostly consisted of crushed tomatoes rather than a sauce, which worked. We ordered the Malnati's Chicago classic. Very cute venu.

And BOY LEMME TELL YA. It was so bad I literally couldn't put it in my mouth. I am not usually a picky eater and I felt so bad that I just asked for the Check and left. Part of me thinks that maybe It's just one bad thing on the menu, but it is literally listed as \"a pizza so good, we had to give it our name\" like okay no. This was a 0/10 pizza. The 2 stars are for the wait staff and atmosphere.",

This pizza place is tucked in by the corner of the shopping center. The location is quite big and they have a bar near the entrance. Parking was busy, service was very good. We ordered just the crustless pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos. It was very tasty and filling. We arrived around 4pm on a Saturday and we did not have to wait to be seated.

Even better than the real thing!  It felt like cheating.    I loved it.",

    "text": "Goodness gracious, what's with everyone liking stuff because it's from Chicago? We get it, you fly the W. You're on the Blackhawks Bandwagon. You relocated for economic reasons but may or may not even be from there.   But I can forgive all these when you bring your delicious pizza. Let me tell you, deep dish is *amazing*, so when everyone *swore* Lou's was he end-all-be-all, I set my expectations high and made it a priority to try this out.   What's awesome about this place is that despite being thousands of miles from its other locations, it still manages to run like a well-oiled machine. You can order for pickup in advance ONLINE, which for some reason is too difficult for a lot of their competition. You can also swing by and pick up an uncooked one on a whim and bake it yourself. That's totally choice.   Service and atmosphere are spectacular! Everyone here is a pleasure. So why do I give it just 3 stars?   Well, I've just got some reservations about the pie, is all. Here's a list.   -Sorry, the crust is rock hard, and that's not really a good thing. Yes, I get that it's unique, and I don't mind a bit of crunchiness, but this is like a brick! It was much more enjoyable after spending a night in my fridge. =)  -The crust is flavorless. Yes, even the buttercrust, and I'm far from the first person to have this critique. I have no idea why people rave about what an upgrade it is, it is the most tasteless crust I've ever had from a premium pizza parlor. Are there consistency issues or something?   -I don't think there's much diversity in toppings here, at least not compared to other Chicago-style spots. The pepperoni is lame, so don't bother. The Lou was marginally better, but I guess the only one that matters is the Malnati Classic, which I should give a try. Really though, there are like four options here, which is lame considering so many other places can have a solid dozen premium toppings.   -They're pretty small for what you get. Everyone at the table needs to agree to one kind of pizza so you can go big, otherwise you might feel a bit shortchanged.   Overall, I know I'll be back because pizza is pizza. They are doing plenty of things right. But is it this legendary pie you should go out of your way for? Not really, our deep dish scene would continue to do just fine without it.",

This was my first experience with deep dish pizza (aside from a little order at the O'Hare airport food court, which was dry and disgusting, as expected). I had a busy night, so my s/o got us some frozen pizzas and the combination platter.  Pros: - The crust was flaky and yummy, and the crust-to-sauce-to-\"topping\" (Is it still called a topping if it's on the bottom?) ratio was simply fantastic. Usually, when I eat pizza, I feel the need to alternate between the saucy, flavorful tip of the slice and the crust. Not with Lou Malnati's!   - I. Love. Breaded. Mushrooms. and theirs were one of the best, with a nice crisp (even though it sat in the container for 30 minutes before I got to eat them), and juicy inside. In general, the combination platter was yumyumyummy.    Cons: -  The website didn't make it clear that the offerings for frozen pizza were not the same as the ones for in-house. I was SO excited to try the Lou and to experience spinach + mushroom + garlic crust, and was so sad that I couldn't. IIRC the options available are cheese, spinach, veggie (green peppers, onions, and mushrooms, I believe), sausage, and pepperoni). - The spinach pizza I ended up getting was good, but there was a little too much cheese for my liking. My s/o's sausage pizza had a better cheese ratio, but it was a little bit too wet and drippy for my liking.  I will definitely be back to try Lou's in person though!",

The sauce is perfect, not overly seasoned and extremely fresh!  Cheese is also excellent (fresh hand shredded and melted to perfection!).

Pizza was delicious, we got the large Chicago classic , that buttercrust! It just makes the pizza so much better than the any others. Best deep dish around, don't know if can go back to thin base pizza. Save space for desert too, the warm cookie skillet is the perfect way to finish off the meal!",

The manager Alexis went above and beyond to ensure that we had a table that fit our needs. The hostess staff was incredible and attentive to our group, and our waiter FRITZ....UNREAL! That guy is truly amazing. I appreciated most that the wait staff seemed to all work together to ensure that all 20 of us enjoyed our experience. The attentiveness of this team was incredible. I was delighted by the experience here. It was my first visit and I am sure it will not be my last. Fritz and Alexis stood out to us most but everyone was great! Thank you for a great dining experience.   The dining space is small, be prepared to wait , but you can order ahead of time while you wait which makes your wait time for food significantly less when you sit down. This was a great tip by the hostess team. Thank you! :)",

We sat at the bar since I like more of the atmosphere there.  First we ordered the wings which only come in choice of 2 sauces hot and bbq.  It would be fine if it was a their specialty, but we could tell it is not.  The hot sauce has a touch of sweet that throws off the whole flavor and it doesn't work.  On to the pizza, we ordered 2 different kinds, so we could share and try both.  The pizza looked like a kids pizza size and it took 35 mins to make, very unrealistic based on the proportions of the pizza and the wait time to make.  The pizza it self did not feel or tasted like a pizza its consistency was more like a pot pie.  There lots of dough with little tasteless ingredients in the middle.  I had the real thing back in Chicago, that felt, smelled, was served in the actual deep dish that was made in, but more importantly it tasted like real Pizza.  This is a commercialized cheap version of it.  Don't believe the hype.  One day soon there will be a real Deep dish Pizza here in Phoenix; unfortunately Malnati's is not it!",

Also, the Staff at this location could truly use some Customer Service Skills Training...VERY unfriendly and not in the least bit interested in one's business from my own observations and sitting there watching their interactions with others.  Come on, folks, there have to be better places out here and at less exorbitant prices!!!!",

    "text": "I've only had Lou's in the past via frozen shipped across the country pizza (and it was still really good!) so when we heard they were opening in Phoenix we had to check it out. We got there at about 4:45 on a Thursday to a bunch of people standing outside being told it was an hour plus wait. We drove from Queen Creek so we were staying regardless of the wait time. When we checked in we were told the wait for a party of 2 was only 30-35 minutes, score!! We added our name to the list and then they suggested that we preorder our food so we don't have to wait an additional 45 minutes once seated. 32 minutes later, our table was ready and we were seated. Here's the only downside about our experience, we were seated at 5:20 and for some reason our preordered pizza was never started because we waiting until 6:10 to get our pizza. We both loved what we had (The Malnati Chicago Classic and the Cheese Deep Dish with Buttercrust) but didn't really understand why we would preorder if we still were going to wait 50 minutes for food- they dropped the ball in that aspect. We still bought 2 frozen pizzas to go and took our leftovers- would we come back? Maybe- it is a bit of a drive from Queen Creek (an hour each way), but it was really good.",

    "text": "I took my sons to Lou Malnati's, and have to say it was just an \"OK\" place.  We waited a few months after they opened to avoid the long wait lines.  We went for lunch and luckily there wasn't a wait.  I had been to Lou Malnati's in Chicago years ago and had remembered I liked it a lot.  The restaurant was full, but not packed.  After sitting awhile, we had to flag down the waiter that appeared to be working our side of the room.  We all ordered personal deep dish pizza's, cheese bread and sodas.  I had hoped to order a Caesar Salad, but was told they didn't have one in Phoenix, and they are still trying to \"Dial In\" their kitchens.  Our drinks and cheese bread that we ordered came relatively fast, but then we waited, and waited, and waited for the pizza's to arrive.  When they finally showed up at our table (about 45 minutes after we finished our appetizers), I almost began to chuckle but kept my composure.  The \"Personal-sized\" pizzas are so small, I almost thought it was a joke.  As for the deep dish....the pizza had thick (and very hard) crust, however the bottom part was only about 1/4\" thick and the pizza sauce had a lot of watery runoff.  We all finished our pizzas in about 5 minutes.  Then we sat and waited for our bill.  We eventually had to flag down our waiter again just to get the check so we could leave.  All-in-all, we were there almost two hours and left hungry.  I think I'll stick to some other locally established pizza places until they can \"Dial-In\" their kitchens a bit more, and would definitely order a larger pizza.  Their prices are very high for what you get as well.",

The Pizza from the Phoenix location is equal in every way. Most probably because it is family owned and not franchised. This store even treats the water to duplicate Chicago water for consistency in the crust.",

She was friendly, remembered anything we asked for (extra napkins etc) and she and another gal at the end of our lunch, brought Dad a warm, ramekin filled chocolate dessert with whip cream and a candle and sang with us Happy Birthday to Dad.

    "text": "While living in Chicago I didn't go to Lou's. My place, and everyone in Chicago has \"a place\", was Pizzeria Due. Simply the best and original creator of Chicago pizza. Well, after moving I was relegated to ordering and having it shipped. Due doesn't ship. So I had to settle for Lou's. God da#n it was good. After some investigation I found out that when pizzeria due first opened, they had a chef. After the insane amount of success and pizzeria due becoming a Chicago institution, that chef left and opened his own place. The name of that place............Lou Malnati's!!!!!!!! So that's the back story. The pizza is outstanding and if your not from Chicago and you hear people making a big deal out of deep dish pizza, you tried it and thought......meh. Big deal. Giordanos for example. I don't blame you. But don't decide till you've tried Lou's. To eat a slice, and while eating your looking forward to when you get to the crust!!!!!! That's some good pizza. I'm not exaggerating. If someone got Lou's and ate the whole thing and only left the crust, which would never happen as it's so awesome, but say they did. Anyone would eat up every piece of crust and be happy to have it. Choose Lou's. You won't regret it.",

Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed. Way more bread than cheese. It might be hard to see more than the little string, but it was mostly bread, a layer of sausage and pepperoni and sauce.

Being a fan of deep dish I was excited that we were finally getting an authentic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza restaurant, since I've been having withdrawals ever since I moved to Phoenix.    The \"butter crust\" had way too many consistencies, from soft in the middle to the \"more stale than crisp\" edges. The cheese was ample and chewy, but bland, and the tomatoes you could tell were fresh....out of the metallic can that they tasted like.  The sausage was equally disappointing and bland, missing a lot of the spices that would make them \"Italian\" sausages.  My three co-workers had similar comments...  Oh, and one last thing...Speaking of \"Authentic,\" lets talk about the wall-sized historic photo of the Airport which is clearly titled \"SKY HARBOR AIRPORT, PHOENIX, AZ,\" but is actually a photo of a historic airfield in Glendale, California!!",

Very odd. We also keep it simple because that's all you usually need at Lous. Sausage butter crust. Boom. Done. This was unedible.  The good:  The manager took care of the pizza and gave us a small frozen one to take home. She admitted it wasn't right and couldn't put her finger on why.  The Malnati salad is awesome. Always.

If we had been a party of 4, we would have had 14 more tables in front of us to contend with (according to their seating / wait list app). By the time we were seated, the bar area was jam packed full of people. I'm talking like a popular Scottsdale night club at midnight packed, no room to move by approximately 6PM.   Even though it was the middle of the summer in Phoenix, they keep their garage door windows open (presumably because of how many people are jammed in there waiting? opens up more bar seats). So not only was it packed, but it was SO hot. My pregnant self was grateful for the ONE bar seat we managed to secure during our wait.  They are known for their signature sausage pizza. I do not recommend  deterring from the menu and adding extra toppings (specifically extra veggies). Reason #1 being because it is pricey to do so and reason #2 being because they don't precook the veggies before putting them on the pizza (so our pizza came out sort of a watery mess because of the veggies).  I will say that we experienced great service all around. We highly enjoyed their signature salad and the other pizza that we ordered (that we didn't modify). Our leftovers tasted more delicious than at the restaurant, I speculate this was because we popped the pizza back in the oven and it burned up some of the excess moisture from the veggies.  Be prepared for long, hot and uncomfortable wait times and a minimalist menu.",

The prices are reasonable, love the decor because it just feels so cozy. They bring all their supplies and ingredients straight from Chicago!!! Even the water!!! They have a cute little bar and also a great outdoors seating with a mist system for the hot weather. Come check out this place if u want to enjoy some great pizza straight from Chicago.",

    "text": "I was very excited for Lou's to open in Phoenix. I have had their pizza once in Chicago, and it was quite the memorable experience. Due to the insanity of their opening week lines, I chose to order a pizza and spinach bread online and pick up. I ordered online early in the morning to pick up at around 7. When we arrived, the order was ready to go, and we happily passed the enormous line of people waiting for tables. The pizza was tasty... super heavy (as expected) but flavorful. We got a butter crust pie with pepperoni and garlic.... tasty business. The cheese/spinach bread was nothing terribly exciting. I would pass on that next time (especially because we couldn't even finish our small pizza and the extra order was unnecessary). If you are a deep dish fan, check out Lou Malnati's, it didn't disappoint.",

Now don't get me Wong, this isn't New York pizza but it is dead on Chicago pizza and I will take it. Whether you choose the deep dish, which is spectacular or the thin crust (beyond words) you will be in heaven.  I love both but I have to say the thin crust Lou is my favorite. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. You will never think of any other place for your pizza fix once you try Lou's.",

    "text": "I have no interest in deep dish pizza and not a whole lot of love for Chicago, having had its wonderfulness shoved down my throat during the 36+ years that I have lived here.   Still, I do love pizza and was a bit curious when I heard that they also served a thin crust pizza. When I found out that they deliver, I could not resist. I live a little more than two miles from the place, don't know how far their delivery area extends. Using their website, I ordered a thin crust pizza with pepperoni. There were options for extra tomato sauce and extra cheese but no options for less of either. You can order it gooey, regular, crispy and \"half baked\". You could also specify cut or uncut, they recommended uncut but the radio button for cut was preset. I specified regular and cut. I was ordering around 5:35, they said the delivery would come 6:30-6:45.  The pie arrived at 6:38 as promised. It was a little less warm than I would have liked it but not bad for a 2+ mile delivery. The cheese was on the top. The pizza was cut in squares. I was impressed with the crust, the edge pieces in particular. There was more cheese than I would have wanted and maybe a little more sauce. The sauce was pretty good, I'd give it a B. The crust, particularly on the middle pieces, was a little softer than optimal. I might try crispy the next time, if there is a next time.  Overall it was not a bad experience. Might just order again, but then again there are tons of pizza options in this part of town, some that I haven't tried yet like Federal Pizza. I definitely wouldn't go to Lou Malnati's nor would I partake of their signature deep dish offerings, but for delivery it wasn't half bad.",

    "text": "I've been composing this review in my head ever since it was first announced that Lou Malnati's was coming to Phoenix. Being from Chicago I've eaten Lou's from several locations: River North on Wells Street, Gold Coast on State Street, Naperville, IL, Carol Stream, IL and the Bucktown location. I am thrilled to say that the Phoenix pizza is JUST AS GOOD AS THE CHICAGO locations!!!!!   I recently discovered that I have an intolerance to gluten. I was prepared to suffer week long stomach pain for this pizza when my sister suggested I check the website to see if GF options are available. THANK YOU GOD!!!!! For that simple fact alone you deserve 10 stars. I no longer eat meat and found my onion and garlic pizza just as delicious as a sausage or pepperoni. The tomatoes and cheese were top notch as usual.  Moving to Phoenix several years ago I've been homesick for many types of food, pizza just one of them. Every year since moving here my husband and I would ship Lou Malnati's pizza for our Christmas dinner. For me it's not just about the pizza, it actually feels like a part of home is in Central Phoenix and I can't thank you enough.",

Gave me a chance to look at the menu. They have an option to preorder food so when you sit down it will be ready. I wouldn't do that based of the fact that your wait Tim could increase like mine did by an additional 45 minutes. Now let's talk about the food I ordered the chicken with mushrooms and spinach. That was awful. There was no flavor or taste to my food. My daughters pizza was dry and no flavor as well. I hate salt in my food and I was salting my food. The waiter was amazing and kind and the manager gave us a discount for the wait, which was nice but that food though. I've had better . My friends lasagna was good from what he says . The best part of the dinner was the honey bbq chicken wings.",

Before he even asked what was going on, the manger came out and told him how sorry she was for the wait and mishap. Not only was she apologetic, they comped our pizza and gave us a free one for next time. What a great establishment and they definitely know how to keep loyal customers.",

We decided on the Bruschetta appetizer and to split the Italian Beef Sandwich.   The Bruschetta is AMAZING!  We split it between 2 of us, but there were enough that it easily could've been shared by 3-4 people. The topping of diced tomato, a little balsamic, basil, garlic and shaved Parmesan cheese was fresh and had awesome flavor.  It may just be my main course next time!!  The beef sandwich was excellent with VERY generous portions of beef topped with melted Provolone on a French roll. It comes with Gardinare (sp?), and au jus, along with a side of curly fries. My son ate the fries and said that they were good.   Our waiter was very nice, friendly and didn't hover. He did seem to be there when we needed him and was helpful about beer selections and food.   As far as seating goes, I've witnessed long waits, however on a Wednesday evening at 5:00 pm we were able to walk in and be seated immediately.  The patio is really nice and it'll be great to come back and sit there during nice weather.   All in all it was a nice dinner. Price wise, it was what I expected, so no surprises. I'm sure we'll be back!",

We were seated right away and went over the menu. We usually get the large pie to bring leftovers home as it freezes & reheats great. It would take about 30 minutes--at the time we were there--to bake out order. We ordered the Large Deep Dish Chicago Classic with one extra item @ $27.25, Mozzarella sticks @ $6.25 to pass the time and two soft drinks @ $2.45 each. Refills were NOT an issue and appeared without asking! Service was great and very attentive. My wife could handle one slice while I have two---very filling but have 5 slices left for next week. Chicago type is not thin crust but a deep dish pie that we knew about. They have a full menu for all including salads, thin crust pizza & a kids menu if required. We would highly recommend this Pizzeria to all.",

The spinach salad was pretty good but tenge house salad with that dressing was so good! It was creamy and flavorful and a nice change from ranch. I would order the house with the lemon dressing again for sure. The pizza came out fairly quickly and I was really impressed. The Lou was my favorite with all of the vegetables, but the malnati was also really good. The sausage was flavorful and fresh and the sauce was nice and chunky and not too acidic. Everything tasted really fresh. The crust was awesome too. The pepperoni pizza was good, but not as great as the other two. The pizza was thick and hearty like deep dish, but it wasn't greasy or heavy like some deep dish pizzas can be. The prices were also reasonable. It was about $24 for a large pizza which would easily feed four people.",

    "text": "I'm so confused and pretty bummed out. I read the reviews from others and I hear about flaky crust and rich flavor. I hate negative reviews but I just can't believe the pizza we got was the pizza so many people have loved. We're IL people so my sister and her boyfriend have been to Lou's in Chicago. They raved about it so we were excited when they added Phoenix as their first attempt at branching out. I was going to do one star but I did two because they had great Sprite and the Malnati Salad was really good. My girlfriend and I split a small one and there was some still left over.   Here's where it all went wrong and was so extremely disappointing. We ordered the small, really small Malnati Chicago Classic. We figured our first time there we had to try the pizza they call their specialty. My sister and her boyfriend got a deep dish pepperoni.  I took a bite so excited to taste this pizza finally! I was shocked that the one time I tried to make a homemade Chicago deep dish Pizza at home and messed it up by over kneading the dough mine was extremely better. We didn't get buttery flaky crust. We got what tasted like frozen white bread dough unseasoned and pressed into a pan. I'm not trying to be mean. I loved the staff and I believe something must have gone wrong because the cheese was almost nonexistent and the sauce was just kind of drizzled on. Another reviewer posted a picture of the exact same Pizza and it looked NOTHING like ours. My sister and her boyfriend were also shocked at how different it was from the Chicago locations. The sausage was lackluster. We expected some kick but it was just a bland sausage texture. I don't understand what happened. I'm so sad. It was the most bland pizza I've ever had.",

Definitely pizza, but taste unlike any you've had.  Guaranteed that you'll tell your friends",

Pizza was steaming when I opening the box. Couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner.  Have order a couple times since and always great service.

    "text": "We had tickets to the pre-grand opening but didn't go that day. We went about a week later, and there was a line waiting for the restaurant to open. We were about the 20th party in line, and when they opened, we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated. We talked to Mark, the owner, at this location, and he was very friendly. One of us in our party knew Mark's father.  Mark walked around the restaurant and greeted customers and asked them how everything was. The restaurant is very clean and the decor looks very much like a pizzeria.   We ordered a family house salad, which was out-of-this-world good. It had mixed greens, tomatoes, black olives, and cheese in it, but the dressing is what really made it tasty. The waiter served each of our salads. There were five of us, and there was plenty of salad left over. Then we ordered 3 small deep dish pizzas, and we ended up taking a whole pizza home. One had pepperoni, and the other two were plain cheese. The pizzas had so much delicious, melting, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, and the pizza crust was original in taste and very good.  I recommend getting there early at opening time, which is 4 p.m. The atmosphere is somewhat loud, most likely due to the amount of people inside the restaurant, but very amiable. The servers are very conscientious and friendly, and they will go out of their way to make sure your experience is a good one. A few servers walk around just to make sure everyone is taken care of. There is a bar, and there are televisions inside the restaurant as well.  We're from Chicago, and one of us had been at the very first 2 restaurants that opened there. This is Chicago-style pizza that can't get any better!",

If I was rating based on experience and decor alone it would be a 5 star rating, but the food is the biggest factor so I had to weigh it out. I got the lunch special, which is a soup or salad, with a personal pizza, and a soda. My total tab was about 10$ so you cannot beat such a deal. I loved the salad and the garlic lemon dressing. The pizza was the perfect amount of pie but honestly lacked in flavor. I did not love the sauce, and found the cheese to be more sticky than anything. I would absolutely come back to the establishment to try a pasta and their wings looked amazing. As far as the pizza goes I personally would sit it out.I am from New Jersey, so disclaimer, no, I am not a deep dish pizza fan as it is not my typical Italian culture from that part of back east. I can however, appreciate a good pie, deep dish or not, when I have one.",

    "text": "Thank you people of Chicago for bringing my favorite deep dish to AZ. Gino's East can suck it! Anyways, this is what you order: Spinach Bread, Malnati Salad, The Malnati Deep Dish, The Lou Deep Dish, and the cookie. It's a hell of a lot of food to take down but the leftovers are great and the price is just as cheap as it's in Chicago, so there's nothing to worry about. I will say that the decor is stepped up a bunch of notches from the original locations in Chicago. I like it, but also enjoy the old school feel of the Chicago locations. To each his own? The staff was super friendly. We ran a few issues (water spilled on our pizza), but they rushed us a new pizza and comped our entire meal (totally not expected). Because my sister doesn't like deep dish she opted to order a thin crust...not my favorite but hey they specialize in Deep Dish here so that was expected. However, my mom and her enjoyed it quite a lot. Also, I know I said get the salad. If you're not a salad person, trust me, this will make you a salad person. My friend who is a self-proclaimed salad dodger absolutely loved it. The bacon and the dressing really make it shine.",

    "text": "Hands down best experience I have had dining out, very impressed with the way the present themselves. I know it's the first week and expected there to be at least a 1 hour wait. Our wait was 50 minutes and they time the pizza to go in 15 minutes prior to seating you so you only really sit for 20 minutes and the pizza arrived. What really impressed our family is as my wife and 3 kids were outside waiting I went to the bar to request a few waters, tea, and bread sticks because my wife in pregnant and needed something now. As I mentioned this to the bartender a few moments later the president of the company Mark came over and with 2 waters in his hand and walked me out to my family and provided the tea and the breadstick on the house. He conversed with us for about 5 minutes and also later on that evening as well as we were finishing dinner. Pizza goes without saying that its top notch!!!",

A few of the servers/order takers didn't know all the details of the crustless pizza since it is not officially on the menu (my favorite pizza since I'm gluten intolerant), but luckily Tyler was there 2 out of the 4 times I ordered to save the day! He helped me place my order juuuuust right. He was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and fun! I enjoy my trips when Tyler is working.",

    "text": "Culinary catastrophe. Ordered pasta in cream and ground beef sauce. Literally no flavor. When the server asked how it was, I said it was boring. She was so sweet and offered to bring me something else, so I gave her the dish and ordered the buffalo chicken salad. It was the grossest salad I've ever tried to eat. Old lettuce in the bottom (slimy, rotting) blue cheese on watermelon, and chicken drenched in chicken wing sauce. I don't know who thought of this one, but my opinion is, they shouldn't be in a commercial kitchen. The server again took it back and graciously took it off the bill. I just said forget it, I'm striking out. She didn't need to, but she then brought a small take out pizza for us to take home. What a nice young woman. She saved the day and is the reason I gave any stars at all. Service was outstanding and she tried to make it all better. But seriously, I'm sticking to the pizza.",

I don't eat pizza all that often, so it needs to be special if I'm going to indulge. Malnati's does not make the cut. It was fine, tasty enough. But not even close to being in the same league as Pizzeria Bianco or Cibo, or even the modest Pino's. And there's the long wait. I'll let others wait. I'll spend my time and money on better pies.",

She dropped the check and we said we want dessert again felt like we irratated her but we got it and she forgot to print us a new check with the new total.   I actually thought she was new and understanding. But, challenged my dinner partner and we asked if its been a busy week and when we found out she wasn't from here we were bothered by her horrible service.

    "text": "We came to Lou's with my mom around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon. We gave our name to the hostess to reserve a table, who informed us there was about a 20-25 minute wait to be seated, then headed over to another hostess stand to pre-order our pizza. We ordered a large \"half Lou's and half Classic\" and continued to wait. There were only a few chairs to sit on in the waiting area (aside from the bar, which was full), so I was a bit upset that my mother and my husband who had worked on his feet all day, had nowhere to sit while we waited. Thankfully, the wait was only about 15 minutes to get a table and we were ushered in to a lively but slightly dark dining room area and seated in a booth. Our server was Donnie, and he immediately made us feel welcome and relaxed. He had a great personality that lasted throughout our meal. We ordered a house salad and while we originally going to order the family salad, our server suggested that we order 2 individual salads as it would save a bit of money. Unless the pricing on the website is incorrect, it's actually cheaper to order the family salad vs. two smaller salads but perhaps this was an oversight by our server. In any case, the salad was just so-so and we anxiously awaited our main course. The pizza arrived and it was excellent. I as expecting a bit more flavor and flakiness of the \"garlic buttercrust\" we had ordered; not tasting a hint of garlic or butter in the crust but the toppings were excellent and the sauce was fresh, flavorful and there was plenty of it. Between the three of us, we ate 2 slices each and had 2 slices to take home. By the time we left the restaurant at 6pm, the front lobby was jam packed with people waiting to be called for their table. Overall, the pizza was very good and we will definitely be back when craving deep dish, the service was great but we could have done without the TVs in the dining room and a bit more light.",

    "text": "We arrived at 6 PM on a Saturday.  I walk inside and there are a bunch of people just hanging around.  I asked a person by the frozen pizza to go section where the hostess would be who takes our name down for seating.  They pointed to a women who had a tablet.  There were about 3 families surrounding her.  There was only the one hostess.  After waiting until I could put my name down, that took 15 minutes (6:15 PM).  They take your name and phone number and text you when you will be seated.  I told them I wanted patio seating.  I was told that the wait was 40 minutes.  Ok, that is acceptable.  I was told about how you can pre-order your pizza so after waiting for your seat, your pizza will almost be done, and be brought out to you shortly.  This was great!  Time ticks away and their nifty web link (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwait.nextmeapp.com%2F&s=597cf0dfbbd383ef06dc86eff672216d1563af4507498c8d92545bfa5db77e1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wait.nextmeapp.com</a>)  lets you know what place you are in line.  Pretty cool.  Well, I made sure I pre-ordered my pizza (large deep dish, butter crust - a must, sausage crumbles,  1/2 pepperoni,  1/2 green pepper, onion, mushroom).            At 7 PM, I get a text telling us to check in with the host under red tomato sign right away.  So they were a little off on estimated wait time, but I could live with it.  We go in, the wait staff whom seats you, tells us that it will be just a minute, that they are clearing off our table.  After waiting a while about  10 minutes, the seating hostess tells us a story of this family that paid for their food, got up to leave, but the family sat back down.  That is where they were going to seat us.  But they said there was another family about to leave so it shouldn't take long.   As I am waiting, I look around inside.  I have to say I am not a fan of their decor.  I found it very busy.  The tiles on the floor made my son feel dizzy.  I told him not to look at the floor.  The restrooms are decorated in a way you would expect to find in a Las Vegas casino.  I went to the washroom to wash my hands.  The bathrooms are even more disorienting then then dining area.  I have to close my eyes while I am in there to prevent me from getting nauseous.   We wait an additional 10 more minutes there under the red tomato sign.  Ok, we're getting pretty hungry by now.  Finally, we get seated at a patio table.   I have to say the chairs are pretty comfortable.  My children like how the chairs can rock.  The table seems pretty small for a family of four, but at least I have a table.  It is definitely less noisy on the patio.  I can hear our conversation.  That's a plus.         We sit and wait.  Nobody came over and offered us water or told us our server would be there in a few minutes.  It takes about 10 minutes for  a server to come over to us.  She tells us that our server is really busy (I interpreted it as \"under staffed\").    This person asks us for our drink order.  I then tell her that I have a \"birthday\" coupon and hand it to her.  She takes off.  Five minutes later a different server comes to our table to take our drink order and asks us if we preordered our pizza.   Well this is confusing, who is our wait staff.  We promptly tell him \"yes\" we pre-ordered our pizza.  He goes off and says he will talk to the other person who was waiting our table.  We get our drinks and still wait.   Our waiter was  not  attentive, probably because there wasn't enough wait staff for the patio section.  He also was absent minded when we repeatedly asked him for refills, etcetera and  he would constantly forget. WhooHoo! Our pizza finally came, 45 minutes after we were seated at our table.  So much for pre-ordering.  Our pizza was brought out by yet another person.  I was a little frustrated.  I asked why it took so long for us to get our pizza, when we pre-ordered it.  She explains that Lou Malnati's makes sure that the pizzas are put in so that they arrive at your table approximately 10 to 15 minutes after you are seated.  Well, I complained because it wasn't ready until 45 minutes after we sat down.   That's 30 minutes too long to wait.       I must say the pizza was amazing as I remember it.  My family of four was able to finish two slices a piece.  So tasty!  Afterwards, they brought out a chocolate chip pizza with ice cream and whipped cream for desert (birthday treat coupon).  It was delicious!  I think the lady who brought out the pizza felt bad because she  gave me a free tiramisu for dessert, to go.   Lou Malnati's did remember to remove the cost of the two desserts.   We didn't leave the restaurant until after 8:45 PM.           Almost 3 hours experience for pizza is a little too long for my taste. I will probably go back for the pizza, but I probably will not dine in their establishment again.  Next time I am getting it to go.",

We had to pre-order our pizza and put our name on the waiting list.  There was a 45 minute wait.  We finally got seated and the waitress confirmed our order:2 pizzas and a salad.  It took another 45 minutes to get our pizza even after we had pre-ordered it.  I was beginning to wonder if they only cooked one pizza at a time.  Once we got the pizza, I didn't care for the crust.  It was deep dish but not what I was expecting. Wasn't doughy at all.  Also didn't care for the sauce. It was big stewed tomatoes in liquid-was very bland.  My cousins ordered the pizza cookie for dessert and they enjoyed that.  Despite the yummy pizza cookie, I Probably won't go back.",

First off, if you go for lunch and get the lunch special deep dish pizza it's not going to be as good because they have them pre-made and ready to go for people who need a quick lunch on their lunch break. If you have the time order a fresh one, pay the extra dollar for the buttercrust(it's worth it) and get extra sauce if you're a \"sauce guy\" like I am. Add whatever toppings you want, I just keep it basic with pepperoni but you can't go wrong with anything. The apps are pretty good too, and I believe their ranch is made in house, delicious!",

    "text": "Okay, I have been wanting to go to Lou's, ever since I heard they were coming to Phoenix.  I heard all about the special care that was being taken to make sure the pizza ordered in Phoenix would be exactly the same as one ordered in Chicagoland.  We have been to Lou's twice now, and I just don't get it.  The pizza was good, but not great.  I will confess that while having been to Chicago several times on business and family matters, I have never eaten at a Lou Malnatis before.  I have eaten at Gino's East (meh) one time, and Uno's (5 stars, far and away my favorite Chicago pizza) about a half dozen times.  I am glad that Lou decided to come to the desert, and I wanted to not just like it, but love it and crave it, but it's just not so.  Our first visit was between Christmas and New Years.  We wanted the restaurant to be open for a while and for the newness to wear off.  Sorry, I just don't like to go to new restaurants and wait an hour or two for a table just so I can say \"yeah, I've been there\".  I would rather let a restaurant open, get into it's groove, and let the crowds die down a bit.  For Christmas, we received a gift card for Lou's from my brother and sis-in-law.  I was thinking that this was a truly Divine Direction from Above that it was not only time to try Lou's, but that Pizza Nirvana was waiting for me at Central and Camelback.   So...while everyone was off from work/school we made the trek to central Phoenix for a late lunch early dinner.  We walked in, were greeted and promptly seated in the booth right across from the kitchen door.  I liked it, I could window shop all the food coming out and wait in anticipation for Pizza Nirvana to show up on our table.  We ordered a large Malnati Chicago Classic, a bruschetta appetizer, and for junior, a meatball sandwich with french fries.   The bruschetta appeared pretty fast, was a large serving (I think it was 6 or 8 slices of bread with the toppings), and looked so good, even junior had one.  I couldn't wait to bite into a piece; but when I did, something was missing...flavor, there was none.  Pass the salt shaker...  Our pizza and Jr.'s sandwich appeared about the same time.  Our server brought out our pan of goodness and served our first slices to us.  The pizza looked wonderful, the crust was golden, and the sauce was perfectly red.  Once again, I couldn't wait to dig in.  Alas, as with the bruschetta, the flavor was lacking.  Pass the salt shaker please...  :(  The crust was buttery, but not flavorful, the sauce looked great and tasted okay, but flat.  The pizza was loaded with Italian sausage; but once again, was lacking the flavor that good Italian sausage has (think garlic, fennel, maybe some red pepper flakes, etc...).  Not a bad pizza, just disappointing.  Junior's meatball sandwich looked good, big and covered with a nice slice of mozzarella cheese, a side of sauce, and a bunch of thin curly fries.  I did sample a small piece of meatball, and a couple of fries.  The meatballs were plump and juicy, but...you guessed it, lacked flavor. Junior said his sandwich was okay, but he thought at the time he liked Oregano's meatball sandwich better.  So, we left Lou's that fateful December day, with leftovers and a willingness to return and try it again.  Fast forward to mid-March (last Wednesday to be exact).  Junior is off on Spring Break, and my wife and I are off also.  We decide that this would be a perfect time to try Lou's again and give it another shot.  So, we arrived around 2:45 and were promptly greeted and seated.  There were only a few other tables occupied in the dining room, and we actually got the same table we had the first time.  Our server took our order (we ordered exactly the same as last time, so we could compare each visit with the same food) and we waited and hoped for the best.  Once again, the bruschetta came out fast and large.  Once again, no flavor...  Junior's sandwich and our pizza came out and we were hopeful, the pizza looked great, but alas, flavor was not to be found.  Same for Junior's meatball sandwich...second time around, same experiment, same result.  I don't want fellow Yelpers to think this is a hit piece on Lou Malnati's, because it's not.  I want to give an honest review and share our thoughts and experience with others.  About the bruschetta, I would kindly suggest to the management at Lou's to drive north up the I-17 and try the bruschetta at Times Square on Deer Valley road.  Times Square knows bruschetta.  Lou's pizza was good, but not great.  More of a \"meh...\" than a \"Wow!\".  The crust, sauce, and other ingredients all appear to be top notch.  The flavor is just not there, and I don't understand why.  I gave Lou Malnatti's 3 stars, because I don't think they deserve any less.  The staff was efficient, the place was clean, and the food was okay, but not great.  I would love to try a Lou Malnati's back in Chicagoland and see if it's the same.  Maybe it's time for a road trip...",

When visiting Chicago this is one of the best if not the best. Oh their salads are awesome!",

The server was very nice and kept our drinks filled. I am so glad that we stopped in tonight, it reminded me of home and gave Lou's a chance to redeem itself, which it did.",

Even though every time I come for Pizza it's a 40 minute wait it's completely worth it! The Pizza's are a good size and will fill you up after one or two slices. the sauce and the flavorings are not overpowering the pizza( like oreganos) it's simple delicious pizza. But I will say their pasta selection is very minimal and they focus a lot on a pizza so I wouldn't get anything else. Other than their appetizers which are pretty good.",

The waitress came over one time to refill our drinks. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. I asked for pizza sauce since mine was sauceless and this took an additional 15 minutes.

If they could figure that part out, this place would be a 5 star location for me.  The people who work there are very customer oriented and when they realized that they forgot to give me my order after waiting there for over 20 minutes past my pickup time, the manager came out and talked to me, shook my hand, apologized, and refunded my money for the meal. I  really appreciated that because I have experienced similar things at other places and they just apologized and that's it.",

We ordered stuffed spinach bread and the Malnati Chicago Classic.  The bread came in a brick form that required our own cutting (not a negative), but it was very bland.  What was also bland was the pizza. The only \"Chicago\" pizza I've had has been Spinatos. This  however was: maybe 1 cm of crust, .33 cm of cheese, .33 cm sausage, and .2 of sauce on top. Altogether it was lacking in flavor and I felt overtaken by boring crust, cheese, sausage and marinara sauce. Spinatos at least has a flavorful unique marinara sauce. I felt I could easily have made this Lou Malnati's pizza with generic pre-canned ingredients from the grocery store.  To sum it up: this was a very hyped place that proved to be very basic which lead to disappointment.   The above explains the 2/5 star rating.",

With both indoor and outdoor seating, I was lucky to get a seat outside where I could still feel the air conditioning seeping out of the building.    I ordered one of their deep dish specials, and although it says no substitutions, they have no problems with additions, so I was able to perfect their recipe by adding pepperoni.  And it had the classic deep dish qualities one wants: buttery crispy crust, plenty of melty cheese, roasted tomatoes instead of red sauce, and a balance of flavors.  I was impressed that it wasn't too bready (in quantity or quality), which is a common flaw among American deep dish pizzas.  Service was friendly and prompt, both at the front register and my table, so I couldn't imagine how anything could have been any better.  It was just a couple blocks off of the light rail too.",

First of all, the location within Uptown Plaza combined with the interior retro feel of the dining area made me instantly happy. I love all things mid-century, so the wood paneling and abundant cone wall sconces made for some great eye candy as we waited for our tasty pizza.  We placed our order (medium classic deep dish) as soon as we checked in and the total time it took for it to arrive at our table was about an hour. We ended up snagging a seat at the bar in lieu of a table and passed the time with conversation, people watching, and a few beers.  The pizza was absolutely amazing - it's just a shame I was only able to eat one piece! Thick cuts of Italian sausage throughout and that buttery crust?! YUM!!!

    "text": "I use to love this place but the last couple of times we have went we have received bad service. I was hesitant to write a review because I love their deep dish pizza so much. The last time I ordered was to-go. I picked up the pizza and a salad which was around $45. It takes me about a half hour to get there from my house and it was ready on time. I was about ten minutes from my house when I got a call saying that I must have given them the wrong name when picking up my food because they had my order and the order I had in the car was for someone else. They asked if I could come back and switch it out. It took me twenty minutes to get back and when I did they took the food I was returning and gave me my order. I left in a hurry without checking it cause I had people waiting to eat dinner.  When I got home the pizza was cold and everything was smashed to the center, the salad had mushrooms which I ordered without because of an allergy and they did not include any salad dressing. I called to complain but was placed on hold and I eventually hung up. I think I will try other places before returning to this location. Their food is great though!",

    "text": "I'll preface this by saying I lived in Chicago for a year and tried all of the deep dish establishments several times (Giordano's, Lou's, Gino's east, pizanos, pequods etc)  Maybe it's something in the water in the Midwest that can't be replicated here even though I'm in Arizona native, but the pizza is better in the Midwest I have to say.  However it's a solid pizza (the one that I ordered from Lou's in Phoenix) but I ordered a medium deep dish pizza and the cheese just clumped together and was pretty rubbery almost after it sat for 10 minutes.  The crust is kind of bland especially if you compare it to Gino's East corn bread crust.  Maybe I'll try the butter crust next time.  Overall decent but not necessarily crazy to go back and order again.  Not thrilled with the cheese, pepperonis and mushrooms were good on the pizza.",

Our hot deep dish pie came out right on time no waiting. The pizza had no flavor. We got our standard. Sausage, cheese, mushrooms. The mushrooms were fresh and not canned but this pizza had mild to no flavor. Today was Sunday so I did not eat all day thinking I was waiting for something excellent! O boy I wanted to cry! Pizza blew. I will possibly (not go out of my way or suggest) go back for salad and/or drinks but not the pizza... BUMMER  ***7/17/16  Tried again since company reached out to us.-The crust was better. We Learned they have an upgraded crust (garlic or secret sauce) that they charge 1.00 more for- which is kinda humorous. Hilarious.This time our  pizza was pepperoni and it was better than previous. My heart and cravings still belong to oregano's and Spinotos.",

    "text": "Okay... yes I'm giving this place 3 stars. Was it good? Of course. It was A-OK. But with all the hype, long waits, and high prices my expectations were very high.  We went on a Tuesday at 8pm hoping the wait wouldn't be too ridiculous. It was still 20 minutes. I do like how you can order your pizza ahead of time to save time. However, my experience with the girl at the pizza ordering counter was a bit awkward. I walk up with the menu, she is looking down and writing stuff down. About two very long minutes passed. No \"Hi, I'll be right with you\" or even a smile to acknowledge my presence. Another employee was standing next to her and she didn't even seem to care I was there. She eventually took my order, somewhat unenthusiastically.   We were seated and our server was great and made up for the pizza counter girl. Bubbly and very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a house salad to split. The salad itself was basic but the dressing was unbelievably good! Lemon garlic dressing. I could have drank it, it was that good.  Our pizza finally arrived. The moment we were waiting for. We ordered The Lou. The good news is the texture of the crust is amazing. What a nice crunch! The not so great is that I found the sauce and toppings to be a bit bland. I was putting tons of Parmesan and red pepper on my pizza. We felt a bit letdown, especially considering the heavy price tag.",

You have the option to pre order your pizza so you don't have to Wait 30-45 to make the famous deep dish. I Was finally sat down from my text notification and was greeted by Jordan who was awesome and very friendly. Finally the pizza came out and let me tell you. I ate one piece of the \"Lou\" deep dish pizza and I was done. It was so good and fulfilling I couldn't eat anymore. Leftover overs for sure. We had two appetizers before we had the pizza which might of been the reason for the one piece but the wings and mozzarella sticks were great as well.  But I will say...... This has to be the best pizza I've had in AZ, the crust, sauce and cheese were so good. I'm still talking about it 48 hours later. I'll definitely be back! \"It's not a pizza it's a cassarole\" - Jon Stewart",

    "text": "After giving myself a few days to finally complete and digest the large pizza, Lou Malnati's is as good as people say it is.  The ingredients are fresh, although I do think the tomatoes are from a can, and the toppings are plentiful.  The cheese is wonderfully melted, and everything blends together like peanut butter and jelly.  Of course, the big selling point for the pizza is the crust.  The deep dish style of Lou Malnati's tastes very good, and has a nice crisp texture with every bite.  The best part of the crust is that the crust is not oily or greasy in comparison to other pizza joints.  The atmosphere is fun, but due to the name, it is very packed.  I went in at 8:00 p.m., and didn't get a bar seat until 8:35.  If you're coming here with any sort of party, make reservations.  My biggest problem with Lou Malnati's is that the place opens at 4:00 p.m.  There is NO lunch available here.  Which is really odd since the restaurant menu has lunch specials.  And that is my only complaint.",

Mustard must be a popular flavor in Chicago.  The pizza was... fine, at first.  Then, as the pizza got cooler and cooler, all I could taste was yeast.  The dough is very yeasty tasting and very thick; and the sauce was bland.  We unfortunately, got a large so we could take the rest home and enjoy it for other meals... I wish we didn't, usually leftover pizza is something to look forward to.... not this pizza, it was bland, way too bready tasting and horrible cold... now I am not a deep dish connoisseur and it is possible deep dish pizzas are only meant to be eaten fresh and hot; so that could just be me.  All in all, it was a...less than fine experience.  Time to try Gino's and Vito's.",

Yes, their food was taking a long time. The poor guy was doing everything he could, yelling at him wasn't helping anything. Our server was so nice and took great care of us, especially given the circumstances. The manager was very polite and offering to buy entire families meals and buying them drinks while they wait. Our food was amazing as always. The table next to us spoke to us laughing about how they hadn't gotten food yet.. I told them how great everything always was and that this is an off night.

For anyone doubting the authentic Lou's taste, go in and see for yourself. The pizza was just as good as I remember. I fed a large group of Chicago transplants and we all agreed it was just like home. Special thanks to Mike Sterner for taking the time to personally address the issue.",

    "text": "I am honestly not sure what went wrong here. It was a weekday night our server had maybe 3-4 tables of up to 4 people each (I, myself have been a server before but no judgement) and yet we were waiting and waiting and waiting.. I think our server was purposely trying to bypass us out of anxiousness as I think our order was placed in a untimely manner or delayed? Our server seemed intimidated and I am not sure why we were a group of 3 women - a mother and two daughters. We went up to the front and told the hostess it's been an hour since we got here and its been 50 minutes since he took the order. She told us that the manager would come talk to us which we didn't care about because it was already late we just wanted to cancel and go sleep. An hour later and we have our SMALL GLUTEN-FREE PIZZA AND SMALL DEEP-DISH yielding two people. The only thing that came out in a timely manner was the combo appetizer platter (which was delicious). Our server managed to disappear yet again.. so I went up to the front to ask for a box and the hostess asked if the manager had spoken to us (which they didn't) I said no and she redirected me to sit and wait for my server (which wouldn't been find if he wasn't M.I.A.) eventually I got agitated and went to the kitchen door to receive to-go boxes from another waiter. The bill ended up being $50+ for something that took long, considering the small size and thin nature of one of the pizzas so I was wanting to just pay and leave. The manager never came, server never visited us and the food took to long for the price tag that followed with it - no discount, no apology. Our server seemed flustered (I understand everyone is different, different and I don't discriminate) had I not been a server myself I probably wouldn't have tipped him 15% off an already over priced meal with awkward ambiance. We actually have family back in Illinois so I will stick to my Lincolnwood  location from now on as well as Schamburg and Elk Grove Village. It's unfortunate because we really did try to love this place as we are fans from back home. It may be a while before I try to give this place another shot.",

It was cheesy, the pepperoni was delicious and the crust was special. The second one, was not like the first and made me wonder if it was worth the cost to reorder again. After I heard they were opening one here in phoenix, I thought I'd give it another try-I shouldn't have! The pizza at Lou's in Phoenix was terrible. It wasn't cheesy, the crust was tough and the tomato sauce was salt! Oreganos has a better deep dish, so after I try giodannos, I'll know who the king of deep dish is on Arizona.",

So my husband loves the rich, buttery, flakey crust.  He feels the dense toppings and unorthodox style of the deep-dish make it unique.  He enjoyed the flavors and looks forward to trying different varieties.  We also got a salad, which he thought was fine but had WAY too many tomatoes.  Hubby: 4/5  Myself (and my young daughters) thought it was pretty gross.  Wet in the middle, way too thick and with a crust better suited for some sort of dessert pie.  The pizza sauce was not robust, the meat tasted bland - give me Schreiners anyday...  The salad was pre-made, bland and had WWAAAYYY too many tomatoes...jeez...  Waifu: 2/5  We've agreed that my husband is going to have to go at it alone and get a personal pizza if he has a hankering for this place.  I'd rather grab a slice from AJ's next door...",

    "text": "Lou Malnati's seems to carry much hype.  Sadly, undeserved hype. Would love to say this place was a great place to get some good Chicago style pie, I just can't. Having spent a part of my life in Chicago I don't remember Chicago Deep Dish with such little character.  What's up: The decor is awesome if you get to the back of the restaurant. An impressive lit up marquee sign that says \"Say Cheese\" warms up the room and is inviting.  The pies... sadly don't deliver. The dough is of course deep dish, but the sauce is simply the biggest shortcoming of the place. We ordered three massive pizzas, all under seasoned and had no character. The toppings were not impressive nor did they work with the cheese to help that 70/30 dough-to-everything else ratio. The mozz sticks app was no different from direct from a grocer's freezer.  Everything else is simply typical, side salads, drinks, silverware, service etc... just feels no different from Chili's or a TGIF...   Verdict: The deep dish aspect of Chicago style pizza in the valley is simply a good gimmick to get folks in the door. For those who like the Italian that Olive Garden delivers... you might find the Chicago that Lou Malnati's delivers. It's sadly not a place people who know Chicago-Style pizza would keep on their go-to list. Pass if you are expecting great Chicago-style pie, great for large groups where you're just gonna find yourself nibbling.",

I'm originally from Chicago and the only pizza place we order at is Lou Malnatis so I wasn't expecting much. My family and I always order the Lou and another specialty pizza dish. I got the personal size pizza of the Lou deep dish and I have to say it was the best I've had. It had a pretty decent garlic flavor which I love and never noticed in Chicago. I could tell the tomatoes and spinach were freshly prepared by the color and texture. I was only going to eat half and take the other to go but so delicious that I finished the whole thing!  Between the pizza and the service, I would definitely recommend this location!",

    "text": "Food:  I came in with a friend and we split a small deep dish half cheese and half pepperoni and we got the buttered crust.  In my opinion, a True test of any pizza is a cheese slice.  The quality of ingredients were excellent but the flavor on the cheese only part half was very bland.  The crust had very little flavor and sauce definitely tasted like canned tomatoes lacking any seasoning.  Cheese and pepperoni were good quality but nothing out of the ordinary.  The pepperoni was good quality but nothing special.  We ate the whole pie and left really stuffed.  I did see a salad go by and it looked really good.  Service was good...came in at 2:15pm on Monday...it was not crowded..(note lunch special ends at 2pm) Our server was very helpful with honest suggestions and was going to let us get the lunch special which comes out in 15 minutes instead of the 30 minutes for the regular deep dish even though we were past the cutoff.    In closing I would come back if someone wanted to go there (I work and live in the area) but I would not seek it out at this point.  It should also be noted that we did not get the sausage pizza which is what they are known for and if I do find myself there again I would like to try the thin crust or one of the salads.  I will update the post if this happens.",

The wings were great, plenty of sauce and a bit crispy just how we like, got a few beers as well since we had a long wait ahead of us, even after finishing the wings.  The atmosphere was great and since the weather was perfect we sat outside, which was spacious though very crouded since it was a Saturday night and the table next to us were celebrating a birthday. Still very nice and would definitely suggest it for anyone looking for causal but large place to celebrate.

    "text": "Love Lou Malnatis pizza in Chicago as the crust and sauce are to die for. Always been my favorite pizzeria. Was so excited to have this one open here in Phoenix just 10 minutes from my home.  Got there at 520 and of course there was a line. However, you could sit outside right away and outside patio is adorable. Mist fans and covered seating. It was 104 degrees but so didn't feel like it.  Omg...try the Buffalo chicken, watermelon salad with balsamic vinaigrette and gorgon zola if you like Bleu cheese.  Order your own for $8?95 or family portion for $12.95. Sounds a little unusual but it was so good.  Combination fried appetizer plate is just standard. Comes with Ranch and salsa.  The pizzas...the classic is the best as they put the toppings under the sauce and the butter crust is just simply fantastic.  The Lou is no sauce but has vine ripened tomatoes that are juicy to make up for that. Spinach and mushroom. You can half the pizzas to try different toppings. Large pizzas are about $23.95 per and have 8 slices. Pizzas can take 35 to 40 minutes each so order appetizers.  Plenty of parking in the shake shack/aj market shopping center.",

I'm no expert on the style but I can say this is some of the best pizza I've ever had whether it's True Chicago style or not. I got the Chicago classic (sausage, extra cheese, and butter crust) and it was spectacular. Our office is close by so I look forward to trying this place out for catering. The lunch menu was very reasonably priced and the food was delicious. The personal pizza is more than enough for one person but with pizza that good I didn't stop when I was full. I'd love to try the cookie pizza sometime, just don't know if I have the will power to save room for dessert.  Go, you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "What's so great about this place opening in Uptown plaza is the oldest shopping plaza in Phoenix has begun anew!  The entire plaza has been revamped with some upper scale fast eateries that come to Phoenix already with huge followings from other cities like Chicago and New York.  In comes one of the contenders for the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, Lou Malnatis.  Malnatis replaced what used to be a night/jazz club that closed down years ago.    In the Northeast corner of the plaza in front of the cozy grassy knoll is the brightly lit Lou's.  You walk in to the huge lobby and to your left are refrigerators with pre- made pizzas.  I saw several people walk in and pick up pizzas from the coolers and leave.  The service was wonderful.  My first day going, I ate with friends on the patio.  I ordered a personal pan per Pepperoni with butter crust and the calamari.  A couple of us I. My party thought-out pizzas were far over cooked.  I certainly didn't like the fact that my crust was very airy and crispy.  Almost like a crouton.  Deep dish pizzas I have had in the past have crusts that are dense and thick.  I also had the calamari that I wouldn't try again.  I didn't like the taste and it was slightly n overcooked.  Alas, I came back the next night for New Year's Eve party for the kids.  I ordered a salad, but got a taste of a full size pizza with more toppings and the crust in that pizza was much better.... Nice density, rich buttery taste, absorbed pizza sauce.  I enjoyed the Malnati salad.  It is a sharing size, so be mindful of that.   Oh yes, on NYE, the restaurant reserved 2 seatings (4 and 7 pm) where kids could come and celebrate NYE in Grand style.  What really worked well for me was pre-ordering!  The food came out on a schedule and it kept things at a nice pace.  Face painting is always a hit.  They could have worked out more activity for the kids like maybe had a dance floor, games, an MC controlling the crowd and getting the kids actively involved.   Way too much quiet time for a party.    I wanted to like this place so badly.  I'm a huge fan of Giordano's and Pizza Papalolis, so I figured Lou Malnatis would be a similar experience.  It's not as good as those 2 to me.  My recommendation, based on the group's and my reviews of the personal pans, skip the personal pan and go straight to the real pizza.  Share with someone.  I think the prices are reasonable.  It can get pricey with the deep dish.    Return Factor: 30%",

The pieces of thin crust pizza dough and three different toppings were delicous and just what we needed while we waited for our pizzas to arrive.  I'm not a fan of tomato sauce on pizza, and was not expecting to like the deep dish pizza as much as I did. The Malnati's Deep Dish was good - the sauce was light and well seasoned. The thick, crispy crust was my favorite part of the pizza.  Our other pizza selection was The Lou Thin Crust - a great alternative to the deep dish. The thin crust stands up well to the veggie toppings.  It takes a while for pizzas to bake but fortunately we had a great table on the patio for a really nice dining experience.",

Neapolitan style pizza is the \"in thing\" in Arizona, so it's nice to mix it up every once in a while with some Chicago style deep dish!  We ordered mozzarella sticks to start. I had been crazing them all week! They were just okay. They weren't quite hot enough and the cheesy wasn't ooey gooey, as the best mozzarella sticks are. You know when it drags out a foot from your mouth as you try to take a bit! As far as pizza, we ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic, which is red sauce, sausage and lots of cheese.  We expected sausage here and there on the pizza but it literally covered the entire pizza with one large piece of sausage. It was a bit too much and very greasy. Because of all the grease, I spent the night with a pretty annoying stomach ache.",

    "text": "I hate to even write what a disappointment this truly was.. the location is fantastic but I sometimes find people think that gives an excuse for a poor restaurant and to consumers it is even more so disappointing because in the area we really expect more especially with the execution of the food. I waited to try it and I'm glad I did! We were starving having ran errands all afternoon so we stopped in for some pizza. We ordered two appetizers the mixed app with cheese cubes, zucchini, mozzarella sticks and mushrooms.. it was horrible, the mushrooms were ice cold in the middle having not fully been\"fried/cooked\", the cheese cubes where cold in the middle and the mozzarella sticks where solid and not melted.. The zucchini was ok.. yuck next we tried the spinach and cheese bread which is not what you expect yet a wonderful surprise after the gross sampler platter. Sadly this bread would be the best thing we had next to a beer. Next was our pizza, with cheese, sausage and pepperoni... the pizza wasn't cooked all the way so instead of sending that back to we asked for a box. We went next door and had ice cream. The next day we put the pizza in the oven and it wasn't horrible, the sausage is like a pancake on the pizza which made it like a sausage pizza with a little dough.. the tomatoes had a great taste so much so I'm going to try to forget this disgusting disaster and try a different Lou M or get a pepperoni frozen to go and cook it myself. We also waited ten minutes for the waitress while she watched tv after saying we we're trying to hurry to get next door before they close in 15 min. We went to the bar manager or owner unsure and asked to pay and he left for her causing use to wait another couple minutes then she rung us out anyway.. I wasn't impressed in the slightest with the restaurant as the ambience doesn't make up for this. $50 later..  ** Lou Mal Customer Service**  Your response to follow a link failed. I can not respond any other way, yet again disappointed.",

It was the perfect balance of ingredients and crust. I was SO disappointed we didn't have anything close to it in Tucson so I enjoyed going to Lou's every time I was in Chicago.  Fast forward to two months ago when I discovered that they have locations in Phoenix, only two hours from me. I never even thought to look because I was under the impression that they were only in the Chicago area (and other than here, they are!).  We took my friend for his birthday and I had been hyping up the pizza HARD so I was hoping it didn't disappoint. It did NOT disappoint. Upon first taste, I knew I was at Lou's. While the decor here is much different than in the Midwest, the taste was EXACTLY the same. We found out from the waiter that they take this so seriously that the ph levels in the water have been modified to match that of what they use back east so that helps match the flavors. Talk about being committed to consistency!  I have since taken another friend and they loved it, too!  Lastly, next month is mine and my husbands 9 year wedding anniversary and we are spending a weekend in Phoenix. Guess where one of our stops will be?",

For starters, this AZ version is more like a flattened quiche, than the super doughy thick pan pizza in Chicago's Lou Malnati's.  Also there was a review which mentioned a lack of taste. We both noticed that, too. For all the ingredients, this pizza pie lacked a punch or taste. It was, you might say, almost bland.   Disappointed. I will communicate with Lou's in Chicago and tell them their brand is being impaired by this place. Maybe the, yeast and/or the water is different?  p.s. the bruschetta were reasonably good, though. Although, please pronounce it right already, especially when I do it for you when I order. It's not broo-shetta. It's broo-sketta. Geez!",

It's been hard to stay away since you moved in next door and I'd like to petition you move along and find some other neighborhood to tempt with your gooey, delicious, cheese for miles Chicago deep dish pizza.  For about $30 you'll get a awesome large pizza that'll feed four people, or one person four times depending on how you look at it. Lou's got wings, he's got salads, he'll serve up the pizza that your whole family will love. Save room for dessert, because those are super tasty too.   Lou, please bring my pizza with some extra sauce, that crumbling sausage, and whatever love it is your kitchen wants to put into it today. I'll be there in about 30 minutes ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

They have good lunch specials, too, if you're coming for a lighter meal.   I'm looking forward to coming back for happy hour and enjoying discounts on appetizers and drinks.   The service here is good - could be a bit better - not sure if outdoor seating implies a bit slower service, but it's passable.   There's freezers here in the entry so you can just stop in and buy some frozen pies to cook at home.",

The service was fine, that's where I put three stars but the food just wasn't worth the price or the hype. The crust of the deep dish tasted like a frozen pizza crust. None of our party was impressed with this place. Like I said it's really cute but the food and hummus trio dip thing I ordered wasn't anything special I'd crave again",

I went with another Chicago white who loves lose pizza and I was extremely surprised how much I enjoyed it.  You have to be patient when going here. We put in our name and had to wait over a half hour in the bar The good news is they had a nice selection of beers and I had a local IPA from Wren House. The other thing you do while waiting is order your pizza. I thought this was brilliant marketing. That way when you sit down your pizza comes very quickly you will eat and then leave.  What a great way to maximize your table turns. We started with the Greek salad and it was a very large salad that we all shared and even took some home in a doggy bag The moment of truth came when they served the pizza and it looked very watery at first to me. But I found the trick was to let your piece of pizza shit on your plate for just a little bit and then begin eating it. It was not soupy at all. The crust has a very interesting buttery flavor in the toppings were generous. I will remain a thin crust pizza person, but now at least I will be more open-minded about trying deep dish pizza",

    "text": "I'll just cut to the chase.   The wait was obscene @1.5 hours for a party of 8 on a Friday. They don't do rezos so get in line.  Once seated, the service was exceptional. Very friendly and attentive as all of our non-alcoholic drinks were kept filled the entire time.  The apps were hot and fresh and included the usual cheesy bread and fried bits of goodness including cheese balls. All served with fresh marinara.   The pizza took a bit but was made to our specifications (extra 7mins in the oven) to insure crust crispness. The challenge with Chicago deep dish is that it's usually burdened with heavy, wet, oily toppings that almost always sog the crust. I despise soggy crust. And, well, despite the extra 7mins in the oven, the crust was about 60% soggy.   We ordered the large Malnati Chicago Classic pies with Lou's lean sausage and a third 3-item large, for 8 people. The pizza (despite the soggy crust) was delicious! What I really loved about Malnati's is that NOTHING was over-salted. I could taste the delicate balance of flavors in the sauce and the sausage.   Prior to ordering, the slim waitress told us she usually fills up after one slice. And coming from a rather well-nourished family, I silently laughed her silly comment off and happily ordered three large deep dish pies wondering if the pies would satisfy my large, hungry group.  Needless to say, we had 1.5 pies leftover. And the best part? The next 2 days, we feasted on toaster oven heated pizza that actually yielded a crispy crust. Super delicious and fresh even two days out.  My rating = 4/5 primarily for the crazy wait time and less so for the moderately soggy crust which I easily overlooked considering how fresh and wonderful the pies tasted!",

Aside from the pizza, the menu offerings dont create much variety or excitement as its mostly just more cheese, bread, or deep fried items.  To avoid getting more bread & cheese, we opted for the deep fried combo platter, its an above average platter of cheese sticks, fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, & fried cheese cubes.   The pizza itself has zero competition in the area, its obviously the best in the area as oregano's deep dish is just awful. Personally i prefer my deep dish a bit thicker, but this is ok as it has good flavor from the sauce, sausage, & butter crust.   I was very impressed by the service staff, for being so new they worked very well together and delivered our food in a very timely manner. Our server was very friendly & helpful.",

I like the pre-order option, after we sat down our pizza was ready within about 15 minutes. Reasonable wait time as well for a Friday late lunch.   They also have good local draft beers. I had the biltmore blond, which was great as well!   All around a good experience!",

Our wait was minimal on a Thursday night. It's great that they allow you to place the pizza order while waiting. By the time you get to table...bam!! Pizza arrives!! We pigged out though and we were able to squeeze in the tasty Malnatis salad, hot wings and honey bbq wings! Of course I paid homage to Chicago by ordering Goose Island Green Mile to wash down the goodness. Our deep dish \"The Lou\" and thin crust with sausage mushrooms and pepperoni pizzas were gobbled up! We had minimal leftovers but still boxed it up to enjoy for tomorrow's lunch. Definitely will return for more deep dish fill! BTW folks this is way better than Oregano's. Lou's is in a class all on its own!!",

    "text": "Over 20 years since I have eaten a Malnati's deep dish pizza... Still sets the bar pretty high! Where to start?! Our appetizer was the spinach bread and it was extraordinary. Hot melty goodness in a bread that is uniquely Lou's recipe very similar to the butter crust that sets this place apart from all others.  The marinara dipping sauce was also exceptional. We had the Chicago butter crust pie and it was delicious! The extra cheese makes all the difference, God bless America's Dairy Land (Wisconsin for those unaware). The restaurant is still very busy at all times, but totally worth the wait. Keep in mind this is NOT a New York style pizza, if you like thin, soggy, cardboard flavored crust, I suggest you go elsewhere.  Deep dish is uniquely Chicago and it is thick and hearty. One slice is very satisfying, two will have you sated for hours!   This week I tried a delivery thin crust pizza and was not disappointed. I ordered online and it arrived quicker then promised and was piping hot. I will probably order well done in  the future (an extra five minutes in the oven) the \"just right\"  really was just that,  but I'm a crispy edge guy and I'd like to have the middle pieces stay crispier longer! The toppings and sauce were fresh tasting and plentiful, the crust was tasty and again the unique texture I have grown to know as Lou Malnati's.   Highly recommended.",

We weren't really paying attention to the time, but the manager (Joyce I believe) came out and apologized for the wait and that they had to remake couple of our pizzas.  She send out what they had and within minutes the rest came along.  She went above and beyond taking care of us.  The pizza was awesome as well.  We will definitely be back in the future.  A+ for service and A+ for the pizza.  Thanks again Joyce",

    "text": "Went here last night for the first time, I had heard good things and they were open later then most pizza places. Till 11pm on a Friday night. It was myself and a friend, we ordered \"The Classic\" deep dish pizza. Figure any deep dish pizza takes about 30 to 45 minutes to cook so plan on being there for a minute. The pizza is definitely worth the wait. The service was a bit lacking, the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars. I had asked for 40 minutes if they could change the channel on the TV closest to me to the game, I asked multiple times. It did not happen, apparently only the manager has control of this via an i-phone app. To touch on service when the waiter came by and refilled my already melted water tea mix with more luke warm tea. No Ice. It's called Iced tea for a reason, you would think the waiter or busboy would have a bit more common sense. I had to ask for a whole new glass, then when I asked for some ice tea later toward the end of the evening they told me they were out. At this point I asked to speak to a manager. And they start to clean up and refill the parm shakers and before they are even closed. Which I think is a horrible practice. Like, hey I am eating here, I don't want you reaching over my food to refill the sugar container and other items. I never did see the manager, just some women who said she was out from Chicago and was the server trainer from corporate and they still had some kinks to work out. She was pretty friendly. I would say this is more of family oriented restaurant. Pizza is good. But I can't see it being a regular spot to go to. Would definitely do pick up thou.",

All were very good.  The combo plate was more along the mediocre chain restaurant style but the cheese bread was great. I had thin crust pizza and it was fantastic. I am not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but I did taste it and the deep dish was very good.  It does take about 40 minutes to get your order so probably not the best choice for younger children.",

I feel like this pizza is over priced and over hyped. $30 for a medium pie is utterly ridiculous. Still, we wanted to try it and customers obviously pay for it.

A round table right next to the entrance of the bathrooms. We asked to move and they said sure no problem. As for the food well we ordered wings, bruschetta, salad and of course the \"famous\" pizza with butter crust. The wings and bruschetta were very good but the salad was nothing other than a bag of salad they tried to gussy up with a few croutons here and there. On to the pizza maybe it's because I have never experienced \"real\" Chicago style pizza or the pizza was just the horrible. The crust was nothing other than pie crust. The only thing good about the pizza was giant chunks of tomatoes that sat on top of it. Oh and maybe the fact that I know I will never be going back to Lou Malnatis.",

Try to order the pizza ahead of time and then pick it up if you live close by. We ended up waiting an hour and 45 minutes to be seated and then once you order it takes 40 minutes for the pizza to cook. If I lived closer I would just order it to go and pick it up. I will be back.",

    "text": "Very overrated! If you exclude the hype, several Valley pizzerias make better stuffed Chicago style pizza. My issue with their stuffed pizza is their lack of cheese. When you bite into a Chicago deep dish pizza, it has to be luscious and full of cheesy goodness. This pizza totally lacks that factor. It almost tastes like a quiche with red sauce on top. Everything is baked in.   In some ways I can see why people prefer this style. It is not very greasy and it eats pretty clean both in terms of your plate and in terms of no ensuing heartburn that I usually receive after eating deep dish pizza. The crust is it's selling point. It it is flaky and can stand on it's own. Most Chicago deep dish, the crust is an afterthought. However, I really did miss that stuffed gooey cheese experience. I still prefer Vitos (in Glendale), Giordanos, Oreganos (stuffed pizza) and Rosatis (yeah the same one down the corner).   What does receive recognition is their online ordering process. It is very organized, easy to use and you pay online before picking it up. The pizza was ready in 45 minutes and when I went to pick it up, it was pretty seamless. I didn't have to go wait at the bar for a bartender to cash me out and then another 10 minutes for them to bring it to me (Grimaldis)  For busy professionals and parents, this really makes picking up pizza a cinch!",

    "text": "After listening to people talk up this place like it was the best pizza, I made a point to drive the 45 minutes to get there. I ended up pretty disappointed, still hungry and lighter in the pocket. The staff was very friendly and this has nothing to do with them.  First of all, since I was eating alone, I was looking at the personal pans but noticed they were almost nine bucks. That would have been fine but I was worried that it wasn't going to be enough food. If I wanted to order a small (next size up) the price would jump up to over 14 buck! Again, this was lunch. On top of that, if you want to add a topping on this tiny pizza, like say pepperoni, you pay a dollar per topping. Realizing that I might not get enough food, I searched for a Caesar salad to help curve my appetite. They don't make a Cesar salad. They had one option of you want a small salad and it was about 6 bucks! I ordered a minestrone soup since it was closer to 4 bucks. It was good. The pizza was ok but not worth the money. I don't mind paying top dollar for food if it is good and satisfying but the price for my soup, personal pizza and a water was over 16 bucks plus tip.(added two toppings)   Overrated !",

We ordered the same deep dish pizza, but this time without the extra butter crust. There was still a little butter flavor in the crust but overall it was better.  I think maybe we're just not fans of this type of pizza. Anyway, our server, Carlos, was fantastic; the restaurant was very busy, and he was friendly and attentive. We didn't present the coupon until the bill came, so I believe the server's attitude and actions were just based on good customer service. So while I am not a huge fan of the food, I am impressed by their customer service and Carlos, our server.",

If you like hard buttered crust under a very thick pan full of cheese and small bit of marinara, that is what you get. It was very basic. Salad was mostly lettuce. Had to wait one hour. Crowded. Staff were not pleasant, especially the bartender. If you want fantastic pizza head to Forno 301 on Roosevelt. It is fabulous! Lou's place was way over priced. Atmosphere extremely loud. Crowded and staff were everywhere bumping into all. Olive Garden crowd! . Disappointing",

We had their amazing deep dish pizza and tried half cheese and half classic and it was amazing. It was served super hot and we LOVED our butter crust!!   Our starter was the bruschetta which came highly recommended by our server. A delicious medley of tomatoes, parmesan, fresh basil, garlic and olive oil.   For dessert we sampled their tiramisu and the chocolate chip cookie pizza. We LOVED the cookie pizza and highly recommend it. A warm cookie prepared in a deep dish and served with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream.   We are SO thrilled that Malnati's is joining the Phoenix food scene and look forward to coming here again!",

It took us a while to make it to Lou Malnati's after their new Phoenix location opened (so much food, so little room left in our waistlines), but we had a wonderful time visiting them for dinner this Sunday.   We got the buffalou (cute) chicken wings, which were wonderful. Just the right amount of tangy spiciness from the sauce, and the wings were big, thick and juicy. The chicken meat literally melted in your mouth!   The pizza: The Chicago Malnati Classic. Fabulously done with pepperoni thrown on. I think next time I'd just order a regular sausage and pepperoni -- the classic has extra cheese, not totally necessary. Delicious, but let's be real, this pizza is all about the crust. Crunchy, buttery, light, YES.  The two of us ordered a small, each ate one piece, then took the other two home for a midnight snack. Gotta plan ahead for greatness.",

I was SO happy to finally have something GREAT from back home here! I actually cried on & off the whole time my DH and I were there. We knew the pie would take a bit to cook so we ordered salads to eat. The salads could not have been any more fresh! They were so yummy and crisp. The pie came and I cried again. The glorious waves of heat swafting off of the sauce on the pizza smelled of taste bud heaven! Each slice was girthy and filling.... this IS NOT a regular pizza. It was by far the best pizza night I'd ever had since moving to Phoenix.      The location is clean. The bar is great. The staff was very nice. We will be coming back!

Now that should appease all of the cry babies.    Now on to the review.  We put a order in for our pizza on Saturday night.  We got there and were seated with in a few minutes.  The server did a good job.  I ordered the soup they have there.  It was good as always.  Our pizza came out and it was good.  A Lou classic add pepperoni.   It was the bomb.  My better half ordered a cookie thing with ice cream. She said it was good.    We understand that the pizza takes time.  We do something that 94 percent of the people at the restaurants do not do while at the table.  We have a conversation about our day and week.",

Slower during the afternoons, busier at dinner time. We've tried so many things here and all of them have been so amazing. The only dish that wasn't all that, is the meatball sandwhich, you can pass on that and stick to the pizza, pasta, salad, mozzarella sticks, or stuffed spinach bread!",

We stepped to the side, and another couple walked in and got sat immediately. Another couple comes in, sat immediately. We step back up to the host stand confused as to why we were skipped. The host sat us in a booth right by an open door, after specifically saying we wanted to sit indoors, away from the cold. The plates on the table were dirty with crumbs. We asked for new ones, and got another set also with crumbs. Our server was decent, however, she was also working the bar, so we had to call her over a couple times to get boxes and the check. It was honestly disappointing because i was so excited to try this location. Hopefully they can hire more people/get more organized so their guests actually feel cared for. Food was good though, no complaints there.",

They are crispy and delicious and you can't stop eating them so don't order a bunch or you will never make it to the pizza.  You must try this place.

We sat at the bar and stuck up a conversation with one of the bartenders and he told us about the restaurant, based out of Chicago and all of their pizzas are made fresh to order.   We didn't feel like sharing a pizza so we each got our own personal deep dish. The crust was with the right amount of crunch and flakiness that has me wanting more. My mouth is watering right now! I got the pepperoni and my friend got the cheese. Fresh mozzarella and the crust made me swoon. The personal pizza is the perfect size for one person. I think I might pre-order and pick one up tonight!!!  The ambiance was very cool, just look at the pictures. Next time I want to sit outside and just grab a beer, pizza, and watch a game.",

    "text": "Can you say Keto pizza! Well, it certainly was good especially if you like quality sausage which the crust was made out of and was a good compromise.   A friend who accompanied me on this adventure is gluten free, there was no way I was doing gluten free crust...been there done that and no way.  I would say that the price tag for the Keto was a bit much and had I known before hand I would've thought twice before ordering this speciality pizza, @ nearly $27 for a medium 6 piece 3 topping pizza is a bit expensive. Perhaps this is the price you pay for this Keto eating trend but I'm thinking  a little expensive for a few pieces and the slices were definitely on the smaller side. Not the pizza pie large slice where it takes two hands to slide the gooey goodness down the trap. They were short and squatty.   Nevertheless we tried Bruchetta. Yup, my friend who is \"gluten free\" snarfed it down like it was his last meal and quite truthfully it was really good! A must try and at happy hour prices being 50%.  Lastly, I must say the signature drink was to die for and for the life of me I can not remember the name. It was like a cosmo with a bit of heat...so if you like a little heat with the sweet this is your drink!  Enjoy!",

We had an hour and 10 minute wait. They took my info and text me (with a chicago number!) when my table was ready. I love that they text you with a link to see the status of where you are in line. I also love that you can preorder your food so when you finally get to your table you don't have to wait another half hour or so for your food (so you won't get hangrier). The wait for us ended up being about an hour and the food was out an ready within about 10 lonutes after sitting down. As a Chicagoan, I know that a deep dish pizza will take about 45 minutes to make.  Also some advice, if you've never had a deep dish, for two people get a small pizza. You just need a slice maaaybe two and then you are full. Oh and also make sure you get buttercrust. Tastes amazing!  Wish I could've made it to dessert...maybe next time!",

And now.... \"Hi, my name is Leslie and I'm a Lou Malnati's  pizzaholic...\" Don't like deep dish? Try their thin crust... There is something about their crust, either one thin or thick. You're either going to LOVE it or hate it. ME? It has me salivating all the way home. The smell... yummmmm! They use FRESH mozzarella and PLENTY of it. Fresh chunky tomato sauce, fresh ingredients. I want to try their bruschetta, but crave the pizza too much. Their tiramisu is fresh and tasty also.  The salads? Dont know, dont care its PIZZZZZZAAAAA! The only bummer? They don't have a dining room. Their staff is friendly and professional as well.",

They have incredible dietary options for their food. When I was looking for a low-carb option, a friend recommended the sausage crust pizza. Not only was this one of the best personal pizzas I have ever eaten, my last visit we were informed they have multiple sizes available. They offer a flour free crust as well as the sausage option.   The BBQ ranch chicken salad is so crisp and cool before the piping hot pizza comes out. The hummus/dip trio has a large range of flavor from the hot with jalapeno and carrot to the pure cutting flavor roasted garlic.   Another major highlight of each of the pizzas we have eaten is the sauce. I would argue that the sauce is pure crushed tomatoes. It is bright, sweet, a little acidic.   Overall great atmosphere for watching a game, eating with my two toddlers, or wining and dining our friends.",

They even offer a gluten-free option--a small, thin crust pizza (about the size of a plate). Their whole menu is labeled with their gluten-free foods and items, upon request, that can be tweaked to become gluten-free. I love the fact that they are able to cater to specific needs.   What makes this place amazing for a date night is the atmosphere. I definitely recommend sitting on the patio, when it gets dark, the string of light bulbs turn on and create a very intimate space. Even inside, the simple yet trendy Chicago-theme, creates a welcoming atmosphere where you can pull up a chair and chat!   We ordered a gluten-free pizza with pepperoni and a small cheese pizza. Since it's Chicago style, they place the tomato's on top and the cheese comes underneath. I'm never disappointed in the pizza! The cheese is fresh and rich, the tomato sauce is slightly sweet but works well with the crisp, buttery crust.",

Since I've been missing Lou's buttery crust from my last Chicago visit, it was a swell suggestion to pop into this Phoenix location! Our eyes were certainly much bigger than our stomachs because this time around we ordered the medium which gave us 3 slices each instead of the 2 in the small. We were warned about the extra wait time for this pizza. We once waited 40 minutes, so the 30 minute wait was a little suspect. The crust was miraculous, but something was definitely missing. I felt like the cheese was too rubbery because the cooking time may have been a little rushed. Otherwise, I still rather enjoyed my meal. The crust really ties everything together despite some minor flaws.  This location is a little more hip, so I had eyed the trendy addition of the Cookie Pizza. I was SO glad that this was offered in a 'single' size for $3. It was the perfect size to allow me to get my sugar fix! With a mixture of warm from the tender, freshly baked cookie and cold from the scoop of vanilla ice cream, I was in heaven! I always make room for dessert!",

We were seated by the kitchen and a younger couple was seated after us and an older white couple were seated after them but yet they both got served before us. Maybe because we are Mexican, maybe because we are mid age or maybe because we are fat.  We saw other tables send back food that should of been our 1st hint to leave.   We got our food 1/2 an hour after the 2 other couples and we ordered 1 thing.  The Pizza was like eating a can of diced tomatoes on a soggy thin bread, the cheese wasn't even melted.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to trying pizza from one of the top places in Chicago, without needing to travel there.    We knew a deep dish takes longer than normal to cook, so we started off with an order of buffalo wings while we waited for the traditional Lou's.  We requested ours well done and a little lighter on the sausage.  The wings came out quickly and were really delicious - hot, but spiced just right.    The pizza arrived and looked great.  The waiter cut slices for us while it was still piping hot.  I was looking forward to a little more cheese pull but it wasn't there.    Gotta say though, I was disappointed.  The crust was nice and crispy and very buttery tasting, but aside from that, all I tasted was the garlic in their sauce.  No complex flavors.  It wasn't what I was expecting at all.  I felt let down.  I considered that it maybe lacked flavor because we didn't get the full sausage, but even the piece I tried by itself was lackluster.",

The pie was simply perfect the bottom layer with that big sausage spread was AMAZEBALLS!! That's the winner.  Not to mention the calamari was probably the best and cooked so perfectly.   The customer service was great and this location is really fun with the decor.   Definitely everyone must experience the Big Kahuna \"Lou's\" for Chicago deep dish. Bada Bing!  Ciao",

    "text": "There's a mystique surrounding this place.  Fans insist it's the best pizza outside Chicago...  People speak of it in hushed tones as if they are talking about a purely religious experience.  I know people who have flown to Chicago for the day, just to return with frozen pizzas after gorging themselves on their freshly made butter crust pizza.  Is it that good? Yes.  Now, I am not going to fly all the way to Chicago for it, but I am very happy to find that they have a great presence in Phoenix.  That, I can go for.  Seating and service were both on point.  They had Kilt Lifter, which is always a good thing for those who appreciate a decent beer.  I probably just lost some of you, lol.  It's ok, it get's better.  We showed up with three starving teenage boys, a skeptical pre-teen boy, by partner and myself. For the three starving teenage boys, we ordered the largest pizza with sausage and pepperoni.  It was promptly devoured in a frenzy reminiscent of a shark attack on the discovery channel.  I tried a bite (which was tempting fate...  I could have easily lost a finger!) and it was delicious.  My skeptical pre-teen ordered a personal cheese pizza, which made him very happy.  A win for sure for a child who's main diet is cheeseburgers, hold the lettuce and pickle.  My partner and I split a crustless Lou.  Ok.  Crustless.  I have had crustless pizza before, but this was truly fantastic! They started with a sausage base.  Yes, a sausage base! Then it was traditional Lou's from that point out.  I honestly don't think that I will ever be able to order crustless anywhere else!  It was very filling, and the one leftover piece was immediately gobbled up by one of my starving, shark-like devouring, teenagers.  I am not sure who the culprit was, but there will be hell to pay...",

Truly Chicago or east coast pizza pride themselves on quality and presentation.    This was not it, but again good for the west coast and Arizona. We tried it and would go back as the atmosphere and our waitress was great.  Food was something to acquire but decent and for the locals or those from Cal this place is for you.  I will continue my quest for True Chicago pizza.  Make sure to at least judge for yourself.",

I tended to stick with the downtown pizza joints close to the \"L.\"  It's one thing I regret before moving to the Southwest.  Why didn't I hit up the original spot the transformed the pizza makin' landscape? Mainly because I was smitten with the stuffed pie rivals.   Needless to say when Lou's opened here it was my second chance of redemption; albeit not in the Windy City but better late than never. We celebrated my Dad's 68th Birthday here and had great service. My opinion about the pizza is shared with my fellow Yelpers. It's unreal. The atmosphere and open bar patio is a great place to enjoy the day or night.  The cheese is overflowing and the topping options coupled with the butter crust make for absolute perfection. While I wish for the location to be closer, I'm silently blessed by distance to protect my waistline. Can't wait to go back!",

The fresh veggies and the fresh tomatoes on top really just makes the pizza so amazing to me. I cant even describe how good it is.  Service is always on top of their game here. If you are starving, I would recommend getting an appetizer while you wait because the pizza does take a little while to cook. But I promise, it is worth the wait!",

Service was very good and the menu was extensive.  They have a good selection of craft beers and wine too.  It wasn't very busy when were arrived, but by the time we left there was a decent wait.  We had a deep dish and thin crust.  Both pizzas were very good, very cheesy, and toppings were a little light on the thin crust.  The bruschetta and calamari were both very good as well.

The wait wasn't too bad since we expected it and we were able to stand inside and grab a beer by the bar. We ordered the large malnati classic deep dish, hot wings, and the family size malnati salad. The salad was great and had nice big chunks of cheese and bacon and the dressing flavor was really good and well tossed and mixed into the entire salad. The wings weren't anything special but the sauce was pretty good and we enjoyed them. We were all so excited to try this famous maltani classic deep dish pizza and when it came out and we tasted it, it was really disappointing. The pizza wasn't hot with stringy cheese and tons of sauce, but was rather flat and the crust was wet and doughy. We asked our server if the pizza was supposed to be like that and he looked at it and said it did look under cooked and went to grab a manager. The manager came and looked at the pizza and said that's what the pizzas looked like and pointed to the soggy dough and said \"that's all the sauce right there\", but it wasn't saucy, so we weren't sure what exactly she was talking about. The atmosphere is really fun and inviting. The pizza is really nothing to rave over and if all the pizzas tasted like the one we ate, I'm really not sure why people like this place for pizza. Not sure if I would come back because this was a real disappointment. I was hoping for something better than Pizza Hut, but what we got today did not leave a lasting impression",

Good thing I did. The juices remained in the pizza and the crust was crunchy not soggy. All in all, it was a great meal.

We opted to arrive early to avoid the dinner rush; needless to say, when we arrived at 4:15 PM, they already had a slight wait, but not as bad as a weekend probably.  Once we were seated, our waitress (Malika G) greeted us and took the time to give us a quick run down, which was nice since we had never experienced Malnati's.  We opted to try House salad each, Bruschetta, personal size - Chicago Original and a small size - Lou's.  All I can say, is that I am so glad that Lou's has finally arrived.  The food was so good and the pizza met all of my expectations based on folks from Chicago and the food shows that showed it off.  Our server, Malika was the sweetest person that gave a great smile, checked back often and made us feel so welcome.  The only complaint that I could have was the size of our table, standard bar type seating.  It was too cramp for the food we ordered, thank goodness we order smaller dishes.  However, at least we got seated and were able to dine in a short timeframe and this not a showstopper.  Will definitely come back for dine in when possible, but may exercise the take out option to avoid waiting.",

We were updated through an app what place we were in line, very good communication. We put our order in ahead of time, so that by the time we were sat, our food came to us very quickly. As soon as we dug in, my boyfriend dropped half his personal pizza on the floor. The kind workers of Lou Malnotis replaced his pizza, with an even bigger pizza so that it could come out to us as soon as possible. They went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. We are very thankful and will definitely be back!  P.S. The food was amazing!",

I just wasn't super impressed by anything and they had some sort of weird lighting problems outside on the patio that was kinda uncomfortable when the lights kept going off and changing brightness. Good beer selection from bud to the place across the way. It's a family place with kids around everywhere acting well, like kids. If you have kids and like a lot of cheese then this place is for you. I could see how people would really enjoy it, just not for me maybe. I just don't know if what Phoenix really needs is another high end mediocre pizza chain, like I have borderline particular tastes and would take dominos over this place, I never eat dominos. When you have the money to spend opening a restaurant like this, I don't see why you wouldn't spend it on creating something unique and amazing. They did have a really cool sign though. So maybe try it and it might be for you. I will admit after a couple slices of the pizza and a beer or two you are prepared to take a really good nap. This could be a good early Saturday lunch followed by a nap?",

I had the Lou (vegetarian) deep dish and split a large with my two friends and husband. There was enough for two slices per person which really filled us up. If you want leftovers, order more!  The wait was fairly short considering how popular the place is, and we were able to order our pizza ahead of time so we didn't have to wait as long for it after being seated. The inside looked well decorated, but we wanted a seat asap so we opted for the outdoor seating.   My only qualm was that the server said our food would be ready in 10 minutes and it ended up taking twice as long, after we were seated. But I had great conversation with my group so I didn't mind it.",

    "text": "Let me start off with my complaint.  We had pretty shitty service.  I had to get up and ask the host if I could pay my bill.  I had called it when we sat down.  The waitress came over not particularly interested in volunteering any suggestions after telling her it was out first time.  But I was watching her with her other tables.  No sense of urgency.  She would fill ice tea but pass her other tables empty ice tea glass until a few minutes later the customer flagged her down.  Not only did she leave them drinkless but she walked right past them with the tea and didn't care enough to check in.  I will say in her defence she did come back and check on us.  But that was it.  Take drink order,  take order.  bring out food.  check on us.  then take check.  No refills nothing else.  Let's be honest she probably didn't deserve a tip.  I hope this isn't typical for this place because I liked the place.  I thought the pizza was pretty good.  Crispy taste flavor.  I wouldn't drive 30 minutes to eat there but if I lived close I would go there frequently.  It is probably one of the top Pizza places in the metro area.  Certainly much much better than Pizza Bianca. I had the sausage which is the classic.  I don't particularly love Sausage and I didn't sausage was so special.  It just sounded good because Chicago pizza is known to have great sausage.  It would have been nice if the waitress said we make our sausage homemade all natural fresh every morning.  I just imagined that was the case.  But who knows.  If it is made there I wasn't impressed with it.  I did however really love the pepperoni pizza my fiance got. My mistake was not getting the Lou because I liked vegi pizza and I would recommend if you go to pile on a bunch of toppings.  A good server might have even caught that and swapped it out for me.    Very nice restaurant.  I am guessing the area is a new trendy area.  We sat on the patio on a nice spring training night.  I would highly recommend that.  It's a cool spot. With very good food.  With that being said I wouldn't wait an hour for a table and then 35 minutes for pizza.  Which is what I hear is normal.  Monday night at 8pm it wasn't extremely busy.",

    "text": "Just got back from Mulnati's and thought I would write about the experience. First, let me say I don't often give 5-star reviews because I'm afraid it can actually hurt the business, as it may set impossible expectations. However, in this case, a 5-star review is deserved for the reasons explained below.  First, let's talk about location. This is the first Mulnati's opened outside of Illinois. I appreciate they selected a central Phoenix location. I would have expected a Scottsdale location, or Chandler or Gilbert. Choosing an east side or west side location as their first Arizona location would have been a mistake, as it would be discouraging for someone living on the opposite side of town to make the drive. Being in central Phoenix means its about equally distant from everyone, regardless of what side of town you're on. So they get a star for that.  Knowing Mulnati's has only been open for a week, we knew it was going to be crowded and very busy. There was no way my wife and I were going to endure the experience on a Friday or Saturday night. Instead, we went on a Sunday. Knowing they would open at 4pm, we got there by 3:15 and about 40-60 people were already lined up. The weather wasn't too hot and we were in the shade. Surprisingly, they started seating people at 3:30pm. So, the line started to move. About 15 minutes later, the line moved again. That's when I noticed owner, Marc Mulnati, talking to people waiting in line. That's a real treat to see the owner there. Definitely worth a star!  They have outdoor seating, and if anyone was willing, they were more than happy to seat you outside, regardless of your place in line. We waited. It was our turn right at 4pm. We were then let into the restaurant where they took our name and our cellphone number and were told it would be about a 10 minute wait for a table for two. About 10 minutes later, they called our name. They asked if the high-top table in the lobby would be okay. I didn't want to sit there because there is a lot of foot traffic and people waiting for their names to be called to be seated. I said I'd prefer to sit in the dining area, as I don't want all these people standing around watching us eat. I was assured this was not a problem, and we were finally seated in the dining area.  I know from eating at Mulnati's in Chicago that these pizzas take about 40 minutes to cook AFTER you order them, so we ordered right away. My wife ordered the 'individual' house salad, and we ordered drinks and a small deep dish pizza with pepperoni and mushroom with the buttercrust, of course!  The 'individual' salad is huge and could feed 3-4 people. My wife is very particular about her salad dressing and was very skeptical that their vinaigrette dressing would be as good as they claim.  She was mistaken - and admitted it was awesome! (I don't eat salad so I can't say.)  My concern about the pizza was that it wouldn't be the same as I remember from Chicago. After all, the water in Phoenix is horrible, and while the recipe might be exactly the same, the difference in the water could make it taste completely different.   I'm happy to report they actually filter the water and when the pizza did arrive, it tasted exactly like it should! I also learned they have 28 pizza ovens in the back! And just like in Chicago, they serve Coke products (not Pepsi!) all of which earns them another star!  They had a lot of employees working! This was another concern I had, that employees would be stressed out dealing with the crowd and the service and quality of the pizza would suffer. All of the employees seemed calm and happy to be there and not stressed out or over-worked at all. I've never seen so many employees and upper-management asking if everything is okay. They really DO seem to care that you are having your expectations met and WANT to fix it if not. That's another star!  I don't feel this is an honest review unless I have some suggestions for improvement. I wish the pizza was served piping hot. It was served hot, but not like my experience in Chicago where you'd burn the roof of your mouth if you didn't wait. This tells me the pizza must have sat at the pass for a few minutes before it was served. Secondly, I'm sorry I ordered the mushrooms in the pizza, as they didn't cook at all. If the mushrooms were sauteed first, that would have made a difference or if they placed the mushrooms on top of the pizza.   But for the good news, the sauce is amazing. The crust is amazing. The cheese is amazing! And combined, it's better than sex! Seriously, they should install mirrors over the dining room tables! That's two stars on its own! Even the pans they cook the pizza in looked used and seasoned!   Total cost was less than $40 and we had to take home 3/4's of the salad and half a slice of pizza. (My mouth wanted to eat it, but my belly was full!)  Arrived at 3:15pm. seated by 4pm, paid the check and left at 5:05pm.  Dinner: $40  Meeting Marc Mulnati: Priceless!",

I ordered carry out and was given an 8pm pick up time. Not bad since they are new here in Phoenix.   Walked into the store and was directed to the pick up window and paid for the order. Waited a few minutes and the store looks nice. Got my pizza and went home.   Opened up the pizza and it looked fantastic. Smelled just like a pie from Chicago and looked like what I usually would get. The only issue with the pizza was the crust. The flavor was there but it just wasn't cooked right. I don't know if they have so many pizzas coming out of the ovens that the temperatures are not right, but this pizza had a very light and chewy crust. Nothing like I have ever had in 40 years at eating at their stores. I was deeply disappointed.   I ordered the Chicago Classic deep dish with the crust to be cooked \"just right\" as they offer on the order screen on line. I have never been given a choice in the store of how I wanted my crust cooked, but they are the experts and the \"just right\" was nothing I have ever experienced before.   I know they are new and I will chalk that up as a growing pains experience. I hope it improves. Sorry Lou's, I travel a long way for this and was sadly let down.",

Knowing it would be crowded as they just opened we decided to order online and pick up on a Saturday night.  I arrived 5 minutes before the time our pie was supposed to be ready at 7:30PM. I was happy that there was a crowd but NO LINES! :) A very organized restaurant. Great decor also! After driving back to Mesa (25 minutes) I am happy to say the pie was still hot, and it was great! I do not know if Chicago Deep Dish is genetic, but it was sooooo good. The crust is the best pizza crust (Buttercrust deep dish.)  We got the Lou Malnati's Classic large and it was incredible.  If you LOVE Chicago deep dish this is the place in Phoenix. Go and bring a BIG appetite!! We will be back soon!",

But here's the problem we ordered a deep dish pizza and a salad. Waited a good 45 mins for our food !!!!!!!! I wish our waitress would have told us deep dish pizza takes longer than usual. When our food arrived it was not worth waiting 45 mins for plus had a piece of hair in my slice eww !!!We didn't say anything just wanted to have lunch and leave. The pizza isn't as good as everyone raves about.  We're not from Chicago nor do we know much about Chicago pizza. I just know we Won't be back here.",

The cheese wasn't very cheesy and the crust wasn't very favorable.  Maybe the pizza is better when you sit down and order in the restaurant, but the the take-out pizza is not the way to go here.

Party of 7 all together. It was packed since it was Labor Day but we were seated within 15 minutes. Not bad! From the minute we walked in, everyone from the hostess to the bar tender to the waitress and bussers were extremely nice, attentive and courteous! Our waitress, (wish I would've caught her name) was amazing! She was also the bartender and did a great job! The kitchen forgot to put in one of our pizzas (it was busy and we are all human) and the waitress came to our table was honest and we still wanted the pie but got it to go. No charge!  Some of the food we got were the wings (delicious) the thin crust pepperoni (for the kids) also delicious! The pepperoni deep dish was amazing! I got the Lou's classic which even after i brought it home and want it up, it was super delicious!  My first experience was amazing and I will be coming back!",

    "text": "What a crazy experience this has been opening a restaurant in Phoenix. So of course I read all the hype and stories over the past year and a half and in regards to last week's grand opening. I was going to wait a while before visiting because let's be honest, everyone who knows me knows how picky I am about good pizza and only the NY style. Besides, who lines up at 11am for a 4pm restaurant opening? Well, I guess Malnati's fans do. Even the staff thought they were nuts-lol! I am not even that much of a Foodie.   So, I happened to find myself in the same shopping center today, coincidence? I think not! I walked over to investigate the hype and to get a menu. ( I could not find one online) Well, I got there at about 3:15 knowing they do not open until 4pm. I took a peek inside. A young lady walked right out and started talking to me. She handed me a menu and told me that they open at 3:30pm. They really do not open until 4pm. However, if they are ready they have been opening up earlier to let people in due to crowds. That seemed impressive to me so I hung around and waited. They opened at about 3:50. I was first on line. I am kind of proud of that. I am not competitive much, am I? While on line I had a lovely chat with a family friend of the owners who flew out to help and check things out. Also, the staff comes out and offers bottles of water to those waiting online. This place seems more like destination dining but more on service later.   I was sat quickly after walking in. (Ha, I was first) This place must run on the original 5 second rule because before my behind even hit the seat my server Dave was at my table. Maybe, to make up for the wait outside? He went through his little spiel and we chatted. I could not remember if I had their pizza before on my varied trips to Chi-Town. I believe I might have tried it at Taste of Chicago but could not remember. Dave took my order and was pretty great, and so hilarious to boot. I liked Dave. He is very flexible. He knows the art of compromise! He will make a good husband some day to a lucky young suitor. I say this because after a little back and forth throw down on whose pizza is better, he took the fifth and agreed the customer is always right. ( Maybe he didn't really believe it to be so but I am okay with that) We finally agreed that when I am in Chicago I will eat pizza with a fork and when he is in NY he will eat pizza folded over with his hands. lol. Gotta love Dave! In fact, I have to say the service here was amazing. You are fawned over. For such a busy place they got it down. I like team concept restaurants that share the service. None of that, \"This is not my table.\" baloney.  Okay, so onto the food. It seems my Peeps are divided over this place and their pizza so I was fairly warned. The pizza is different. I was wholly prepared to think of them as two different beast and I agree they are. If I see it this way then I found the food to be very good. ( except i did not care for the lemon garlic salad dressing for some reason) This type of pizza is not the same as NY style pizza. The crust is called \"butter crust\" and it tastes more like a bakery item. Maybe more like a good bakery bread or even cake. The pizza has more sauce on it and less spices and is baked together with the cheese so is a bit blander than the NY style, oily, spicy stuff I love. It seems like it is more like a casserole or pie/Calzone then a slice. I like my pizza with more spices on it. However, I admit I really liked theirs too for what it was. The butter crust is so very good. I could eat just that. I am not saying I did and I am not saying I didn't, okay? However, there might be video of me picking at my pizza and just eating the crust. Okay, who am I? I have come a long way from the Long Island girl who used to hide her crust under her napkin as a kid. Ha!  So great place. The line was out the door when I left and people were vying for my up close parking spot. I think my 1 hour door to exit dining experience was not typical right now so if you are inpatient you might want to wait a bit before you go. Lunch service is suppose to start in June but the menu says it is express pizza. That must mean their pies are Pre-Made. One takes 35 minutes to make. I might drop by for lunch for other menu options when it quiet downs a bit.   So Zonies and Chi-Town transplants, enjoy but sorry Dave, I still like NY pizza better. Maybe return dining is needed for more taste testing?  ( Insert winky, smiley emoji) Happy eating all. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention all their servings are made for two- four people even their desserts. Single servings are even too large for one person so plan accordingly, or for leftovers at least.",

This location did not disappoint!! Right after we were seated, people started waiting quite some time and lines started forming.   We had a wonderful server. We ordered the calamari, bruschetta and 2 deep dishes. OMG!!! Loved the bruschetta!! My son and I shared a pie- half mushroom pep and half pep and basil and with butter crust- of course!! I think I like the crust more than the pizza. Not one bit soggy, breaks apart with a little nudge from the fork. We made sure to get a large enough pizza so we could take some home. My aunt and uncle did the same.  It was a Saturday night and we got there just in time!!   The left overs were just as good as when they first came out. It did not get soggy in the microwave. We were too hungry to wait to hear it in the oven. Enjoyed another meal.   Only down to the restaurant was the noise level. Sound bounced off walls, radio loud. We were lucky as we were the last booth against the wall. Didn't have as much sound traveling over us.  But believe me, that will not us from stop lying by the next time we are there!!!!  Or please- open one in the Bay Area in Cali!! (Monterey/Carmel preferably)!!!",

The bar staff are the absolute slowest people on the planet. Watch them, they move like snails.   The crust is bland. There is no sauce.  And the fresh ingredients leave the pizza watery on top.

To be honest,  It just wasn't an artisan pie experience.  But that's ok.  Maybe Lou's is the kind of joint that's good if you're good, and fine with nothing out of this world.  But I really was expecting out of this world, and given the history, I expected something glorious.    It just wasn't a homerun on this swing.  But look- I get it.  The place is fun.  Bar is cool.  Atmosphere is beautiful.  Lou's is the kind of place to go with the family.  If you like pie, you'll like this place.  But it's not a death-bed za.  And that's ok.  Thanks Lou.  Might be back for round 2 given the right circumstances.  Cheers!",

    "text": "FINALLY !!! Oregano's can go ahead and close Malnati's is here!  Went on Saturday night, knew it was going to be a zoo and fully expected it, they are high tech in the sense that you tell them your name and phone number, they text you your position in line and update it as you move up. You can also check your position on the webpage anytime you want. We were 16th and had about an hour wait, we also ordered our food when we checked in (DO THIS!!!) so when we finally sat down it was 10 minutes and we were eating!  If you've ever been in Chicago then you know that it's either Malnati's or Gino's and Malnati's is usually the best so welcome to Phoenix!!!   The restaurant is trendy / hipster to some extent, nice outdoor area with misters for the summer, modern inside, take out service available as well as pre-made pies in the fridge you can grab and go and cook at home.   Pricing for 2 with a couple of drinks was 48 before the tip so I would say, really exceptional considering we often spend 80 or more on a night out.   Manager was also running around outside talking to people in line and serving them small samples of a thin crust, really nice gesture.   Overall AWESOME",

    "text": "2nd Attempt:  The 2nd time was a bit better, we got the butter crust on the deep dish pizzas this time and it made a difference. It's ok at best, I will definitely not get the this crust there, not worth it at all, in my opinion. All I can say is for the hype of the name of this place, I think the pizza is much better in Chicago then it is here in AZ maybe it has something to do with the water, the altitude but I think it's quality of ingredients. The patio area is really nice to sit for drinks but then there are many bar areas in Phoenix and surrounding areas that have a really nice bar area with food to match. There was a comment a manager and a waiter said to me \"we are still trying to get our bearings and smoking out the kinks\" I think for recipes, prep, and execution on Food kinks should have all ready been worked out.   1st attempt: We had the Malnati's salad that was the only thing that tasted good coming out of the kitchen. We ordered the Malnati's Chicago Deep Dish, a sausage and spinach deep dish and a thin crust pizza and we could not figure out if it was the cheese or the sauce that just didn't taste quite right. Something was off and the waitstaff just told us it must be our taste buds that differed from theirs (the restaurant) but 6 people, 3 of whom are chefs and the others of FOH & 1 food writer I believe we have a good idea of how things should taste. But somehow all 6 of us had it wrong. Needless to say, if I do go back it will be only because I could not get out of a family gathering and I will not eat anything unless it's from the bar .",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Lou Malnati's. I really wanted to love this place but the pizza didn't wow me like I had hoped. Maybe it was all the great reviews that set the high expectations. My overall experience was good though as the service we received was good. I got there early around 4:30pm to put my name down for a party of 7. There was a line out the door but it was moving as the hostess takes down your name in the system so that you will get notified by text message on your phone. Then you can go place your order for the deep dish pizza since they take 30 minutes to cook. I was expecting a 1+ hour wait especially with a larger group but we were seated in about 45 minutes, not bad considering it was the 2nd week they were open. We were seated outside in the patio area but it was ok since the misters were on. The restaurant space is actually not very large. We ordered a bruschetta appetizer and the combination platter. I liked the bruschetta,but the combo platter was average. Then our pizza came. Everything came out quickly especially with the pre-order of the pizzas. We got a Classic and a Lou as well as a small gluten free cheese to try. The deep dish pizza looked so good coming out but then I don't know what it was but I just didn't think it was that great. I want to say that maybe it's still the first few weeks and they are working out the kinks but other reviewers say it taste just like in Chicago. I don't know, I never had Lou's in Chicago but even my friend who did have it in Chicago seemed disappointed.  DO NOT order the gluten free pizza! I know I know, why would I go to a deep dish pizza place and order gluten free pizza?!?!?! Well, I have friends that are gluten free and I'm always looking for places where we can go eat together and have more options for them to choose from other than salads. The gluten free pizza here was terrible. We didn't even finish one slice between the 7 of us. The crust was really hard. I've had good gluten free pizza so I know it's possible.  The pizza cookie dessert was yummy and our server was attentive so overall the experience was good. I just wish the pizza impressed me more. I might come back again in a couple months after the crowds level out and try it again to see if I can update my review.",

The very cool Mid-Century Modern theme of Uptown Plaza is reflected outside and inside the pizzeria, and the staff was very enthusiastic and friendly. Robyn and I shared a Malnati salad: romaine, tomatoes, black olives, salami bits (love that!) and gorgonzola cheese with their house sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese; it was delicious and a perfect prelude for the pizza to come. I ordered a small (serves two, so I could take half home for later snacking) \"Lou\" - spinach, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese. It was a dynamite combination of ingredients, and the garlic buttercrust is so good. My friends from Chicago have been raving about Lou Malnati's forever and now I know why. I look forward to coming back to try other pizza variations.",

I've been a Lou's fan since I was a kid eating pizza at their original Lincolnwood, IL location. When it comes to pan pizza, it has to be Lou's buttercrust.  I normally go for cheese only, but opted for the Chicago Classic this time - buttercrust pan pizza with sausage. Just as good as it is in Chicago, maybe even better because I can get it in Phoenix! Had the small Malnati's salad, enough to share for 2 or even 3 or 4, it's huge! They have their own house dressing, on the sweet side and delicious!  I will definitely be back.",

Don't get me wrong, the pizza was okay. Just not the original five-star pizza in my memory.  I am sure the waiting lines will soon dissappear.  Try it and judge for yourself.

I continued to scope it out for weeks! \"Open...open...open!\"  My boyfriend and I ordered takeout to avoid the Friday night crowd, wrapping around the building. We ordered online one medium \"the Lou.\" The online system was user-friendly. Despite taking two hours, we were impressed with the accuracy of the slated pick up time.   On one hand, the sauce, cheese, and toppings (spinach/mushrooms/tomato) tasted deliciously and seemed fresh, BUT the crust was beyond bland and artificial in flavor and texture!  I was disappointed since this was the main point of ordering deep dish pizza and so my craving continues unfulfilled. I'm not even sure if it's worthwhile to see if the taste improves by dining in the restaurant.   After a bad meal, there are two things you can't get back: your money and appetite.",

    "text": "Well, as much as I'd love to rave about this place I just can't do that. My wife is from Chicago and I have visited there many times but I have never gone to Lou's, she has many times though. So since this place has opened here in Phoenix she has been begging to have dinner here. We finally made the journey and neither of us were very impressed.   The wait was 50 min at 7pm, which was what we were expecting since this place is so popular. We put our names in and hung out. We found some bar chairs open and figured we would hang out at the bar while our names got called. While my wife was putting in our pizza order **NOTE** you can order ahead of time to cut down on time. As she was placing the order a nice fella at the bar gave us his table since they had already started eating at the bar. My wife had just got done ordering the pizza ahead with the girls up front, but they kindly switched it to the correct new table and were totally helpful.   We got our table and within 3 min of placing our order with the girls up front, We asked our waiter (frederick) if we can upgrade that to a large. I figured if the pizza is as good as my wife says I'd like some left overs. It would have been nice for him to check, or even pretend to check instead of just saying \"no, it's in the oven\". I said bro, we literally just placed the order... He said \"nope its too late\". That surprised me that he was just shutting me down without even checking.   We ordered our drinks a water for me and a beer for my wife and a Bruschetta and dude was gone...... He brought our drinks after like 10 min, then he was gone, someone else dropped off our toasted bruschetta Which was wrong  (bruschetta was missing the balsalmic vinaigrette drizzle, but there was no waiter around to complain to, but the toasted bread, veggy, and cheese was bomb). Someone other then Frederick brought out the pizza like 15-20 min later and we still hadn't seen frederick... Since my glass was empty I asked the pizza bro if he could fill it up, which he did.   *more to come on service- let's Quentin Tarantino this and switch to the pizza* The pizza was disappointing, under the pizza it was soaked, it was a pool of fluid that can raise the titanic in the amount of fluids under there (not really). The crust was very wattery and soggy. It was like eating wet bread. I just didn't expect that. My wife was disgusted by it also, but after waiting so long for dinner and again no Frederick to complain to we just ate it. On a scale from 1-10 I'd give it a 5, for the reason that I have never had a horrible authentic Chicago pizza. This was my first.  **back to the service**  Frederick was still no where to be found, and I felt horrible but asked another waiter (michael) if he could fill my water and get me some ranch. He politely and quickly did it. He was so friendly and willing to get us taken care of. Since our waiter again was nowhere to be found, michael came back and boxed up our pizza. As he was boxing it up and asking \"is there anything else I can get for you\", our original waiter frederick made it awkward and stood behind michael. After michael walked away we just asked Frederick for our check. This was the fastest and most I've seen him move since we got there. I wish I could have made my tip go to michael, Michael was the only silver lining to Lou's. I feel at this point this place is popular for the name and the reputation from Chicago. I'd go back and give it another shot but if I get Frederick, I'm leaving.",

We sat at the bar first since we were quoted a wait, and were there for only about 10 minutes until we were called to our table. During those 10 mins, the bartenders never acknowledged us, no smile, I'll be right with you, nothing. As we were leaving, there were a handful of hosts and servers standing at the host stand talking, and no one acknowledged us once again. No goodbyes or thank you's, and one clearly made eye contact with me. I'm not one to complain, at ALL, but we both work in the service industry and were just extremely surprised by this. It's food industry 101 and makes a huge difference in the taste in your mouth when you leave a restaurant.   Food was fantastic though, and again, our server rocked it.",

Even then it was still at least another hour before we could get seated. The hostess let us preorder the deep dish to save time, but as it turned out they didn't put the order in until we were seated which meant another 30 minute wait. Shortly following that we were informed they messed up the order and we're not going to have enough food because they had made the wrong size pizza.  That's the bad news!  The good news is we had a great server who did his best with the situation to take care of us. The manager eventually stopped by to advise us (the corrected) dinner was on her and we even got comped a free appetizer and desserts for all on top of a free dinner!   The friendly President of Lou Malnati's, Mark Agnew, was there for the store opening and checked in on us as well apologizing, and offering interesting bits of information about the restaurant and future Phoenix expansion.  No worries on our end.  Understanding there are always kinks to work out in a new place, we left stuffed and happy.  We will be back!",

First came the combination appetizer platter.   Hint: although you can't make reservations, you can order while you wait so once you're seated the pizzas come out fairly soon.   Bonus: they use a great system, texting a website URL to your mobile phone. The link sends you to a page that shows where you are on the waitlist.   They are known for their deep dish pizza, but I also wanted to try the thin crust. It was okay, but the whole family agreed that Spinato's is still our favorite Chicago style thin crust pizza in Phoenix. Next visit we will just get the deep dish.   Value: 6 of us having soft drinks, appetizer, pizza and the chocolate chip cookie desert, brought home almost a whole pizza, and the bill was $87, with tip an even $100. Really a pretty good deal.",

We had gotten the pizza cookie there before and they were excellent so we decided to try the pizza.   Since going to the restaurant and sitting wasn't in my scope of abilities at the given time we chose to order carry-out. I called once and asked some questions and the lady was knowledgeable about the food and answered my questions swiftly.   So we went to pick up our order (The Lou and cheese deep dish). When we got there someone held the door open since I was on crutches, which is rarity at most restaurants anymore. Our order wasn't quite read so we waited about another 5 minutes. In that time a lady came out to check on us make sure that we were being helped. I believe CiCi was her name. Super nice and courteous. They gave us free desert because our order wasn't on time.  Pizza was excellent. I would recommend The Lou with sausage added!! The cheese pizza was also great. Definitely will be back in the future.",

    "text": "Lou Malnati's is stellar in every way a restaurant should be! Both times our family has dined there have been super due to the pleasant, knowledgeable and adept servers and other staff. It's like they know exactly what you need/want before you even have to ask. All the servers especially our primary waitress were so accommodating. Order the pizza 1st? -No problem. Extra cup for the toddler? -Of course. How about an extra table so you can fit all your baby stuff? (Let me just say many restaurants aren't this sweet and accommodating toward minions, I mean... little ones. Lol. Not an issue at Malnati's.) Food- so yummy (order anything- you can't go wrong), drinks- just right, music, lighting, decorations and overall ambiance- on point. I love the giant homage to Sky Harbor/American Airlines hanging on the Northern wall.  The location alone is super cute since it's nestled in the center of the Uptown Plaza. Parking is a breeze. Upon entering the restaurant, one is welcomed by an outstretched patio with water features, a lawn, and large potted flowers with succulents. Both the outdoor patio and indoor spaces are spacious with highly appealing interior design. I must be honest about how the initial reception area is confusing since the actual hostess area is further back. Is that purposeful in some way? It's humbling for sure. Regardless of the latter, Lou Malnati's will most definitely deliver an excellent experience.",

    "text": "First we hated the lack of service. We were seated and waited at least five minutes before giving up on the server. When I went to the hostess station to ask if our server knew where we were the hostess seem surprised that I was even concerned. They sent a substitute server because our server was chatting with other customers. The substitute server at first refused to take our pizza order, because she wanted to wait for a real server. Since the pizza takes a half an hour to cook, we were rather perturbed by this. She finally did place the pizza order. About five more minutes later our real server came and gave a very lame apology for the delay.  But I understand people have off days on service. So normally I would only knock off one star for terrible service. The real problem was the pizza was not good. The crust was very hard, perhaps over cooked? And the crust seem to be missing something. I wondered if perhaps they had forgotten to salt it? We ordered the recommended pizza, the one with sausage. The sausage was dry and rather tasteless. Overall the place is a big disappointment. We will never go again. Given that there is an excellent deep dish pizza place just down the road, we have no reason to patronize this horrible restaurant.",

Went on a Friday at about 6:30 and waited just over an hour. You can't make reservations or call ahead, but when you arrive, they'll take your pizza order so that can get started and text you when your table is ready. You'll still have to wait a while at the table, but it's a while less.   Pizza was tasty, but none of us thought it was worth an hour wait. The garlic bread was very good also.   The bathrooms were odd. We saw several people waiting outside them, because they are single bathrooms, two for women and two for men. But that wasn't obvious in the hallway, because unless you walked all the way down, you wouldn't see it went \"W\", \"M\", \"W\" and then \"M\" - felt like you were going somewhere you shouldn't (like the office).",

Crispy, yet airy thick crust - Check   Fresh and tasty tomato's - Check   Cheese and lots of it - Check    Flavor - Check  And for a decent price. I tried the deep dish elsewhere and it always cost over $24 for a large. (And it sucked) Here, for just a tad over $20 with the tax - the large fed 4 adults and we were stuffed!   This was my first visit and I ordered online and took it home, so I can not review the restaurant itself, but it sure was PACKED and the bar was as well.  It was real nice that there was a pull out area for those of us waiting to take out. Hubby kept the car running while I ran in.   I can only remember one restaurant on Long Island with better deep dish, so that's why 4 stars.",

My friends, one from Chicago, said I had to try Malnati's deep dish pizza and it would change my whole outlook on pizza. It really didn't. I got to try the deep dish and the thin crust. I preferred the thin crust but, to me, still no wow factor.   I did get to order my favorite Italian dishes. A green salad and a bowl of pasta. Now we're talking! I got the small house salad and the Chicken Louie.The salad was fresh and the house house Red Wine Vinaigrette was good. The pasta was delicious. The 5 of us also shared a pizza cookie for desert. Speaking of sharing, people must eat more in Chicago.  I gave away 1/3 of my salad and still had plenty. I also gave up some samples of the pasta and still had enough for a really big lunch. Also nobody with the small deep dish pizzas were able to finish one. Suffice it to say you either bring a friend to share or plan on a carry out box.  You want to bring a friend or friends anyway. With a party of 5 we waited about 20 minutes for a table and then another 30-40 for the entrees. We got our drinks and salads/appetizers fairly quick. And dessert came about 10 minutes after we ordered it because it is baked as ordered too. All in all we were in the restaurant over 2-1/2 hours.  Service was really good.",

The squad and I rolled up to Lou Malnati's, sans Kazi H. because she hates having fun [and because she smells like butt], after having some edumacational fun at the Arizona Science Center.  We were quoted an hour and fifteen minute wait which actually ended up being 20-25 minutes at 7:45PM on Sunday.  We did as we were told and pre-ordered our pizzas but when we got to the table, we ordered a bunch of appetizers so we didn't see our delicious pies until much later.  For starters, we had the BuffaLou Wings, $8.45; the regular sized Malnati Salad, $8.75; and a Combination Platter, $8.95 which included mozzarella sticks, cheddar cubes, breaded mushrooms, and fried zucchini.  Everything tasted great!  The sauce on the wings were perfect and had a baby amount of spice so ranch wasn't needed.  The Malnati salad was also super delicious and it surprisingly fed five adults.  It was refreshing and light and I like the sweet vinaigrette they used.  As for the Combination Platter, it was a good size and I was hamming on those cheddar cubes.  I love cheese.  I also took like two Lactaids so YOLO.  As for those pies, oh man, we didn't see those beauties for a good while so the wait time made the excitement level go down a notch.  We were all digesting our amazing appetizers and were getting more full by the minute.  I ended up eating a slice of a small The Malnati Chicago Classic and a few bites off a slice of The \"Lou.\"  I really liked The Malnati Chicago Classic.  It had good flavor and the Lou's lean sausage wasn't greasy at all.  The \"Lou\" was a bit too salty and almost-too-indulgently cheesy.  Cheese drag action left and right, yo.  The Buttercrust held all the deep dish deliciousness and stayed crispy the whole way through while maintaining a flaky texture.  Being in central Phoenix, you know Lou Malnati's is gorgeous.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting and the smell that hits you once you exit your car is bliss.  They have indoor and outdoor seating for those who prefer to dine al fresco and they have a quaint little bar area.  All in all, I'd definitely come back to Lou's for a slice of deep dish!  Not too frequently though.  This rich and decadent pizza will go straight to my ass.  #RealTalk",

Decided to wait to sit in the dining room and put in our order of a large deep dish pizza with sausage and mushrooms on on course butter crust dough.  Instead of waiting 30 minutes it turned out to be around 10 minutes.   Our waitress whom I did not get her name was fantastic and took care of us. In fact the customer service has always been great.  The pizza arrived shortly after we were seated and it was definitely not the same pizza we had for take out, was just like we remember from Chicago. A lot t h icker than the first time, the tomato sauce was much fuller and the sausage was much better, but the major difference was the crust. So much softer and the butter crust that we love.   When I had my first review, Meghan, from Lou Malnati's responded quickly and asked to make things right. I also received a letter from Marc Malnati which I was totally surprised and impressed that they cared so much about customer care.  Hat's off to Lou Malnati's, they made tremendous corrections to up their quality to what you would expect from the Chicago Pizza Stores.  We will be back for more.",

When we got here, we were seated right away. The restaurant didn't start getting busy until noon so we got lucky. I was reading reviews of lines and wait times and I hate waiting.   Our party decided to order family style: large bbq chicken salad and a large pepperoni deep dish buttercrust. The salad came first and it was full of flavor. Everyone enjoyed it. The pizza usually takes thirty minutes from the time you order so we waited a few minutes after we were done eating the salad. Once we got our pizza, our waiter served each of us a slice which I thought was nice.  The pizza was heavenly and so filling!!! One slice was enough for me. We ended up still having 2 slices left that we boxed up to take home. Prices are extremely reasonable. Everyone in our party loved the experience: the concept, ambiance, service and definitely the food!!  As we were leaving, I noticed you can purchase pre made pizzas to bake at home.",

    "text": "I got to try Lou's delivery and dine at the Uptown Plaza restaurant twice before it officially opened and the pizza is every bit as good as the hype builds it up to be.  The crust is like the best savory pie crust you've ever tasted- it's flaky but firm, and buttery. It has to be strong to hold up to the volume of cheese, sausage and tomatoes on the Classic, because it's a lot of goodness heaped into this 'za! The flavors are not overwhelming, not spicy, not full of mysterious herbs. The sausage is mild, but like the tomatoes and the cheese, it's absurdly high quality and left alone to shine without much more than some fresh garlic, salt and pepper. You can, of course, add parm or red pepper flakes to your desired tastes.  Lou's cheese bread appetizer is enough for 6 people, with marinara for dipping. Salads are really good- the dressings are outstanding. Lou's tiramisu- not the typical trifle- pulls the cocoa, coffee and mascarpone confection's flavors together nicely and it's enough for two people or maybe four.  The portions are generous here, noticing that theme?  Decor has a lot of mid century modern look to it and it's a really cool and groovy space that fits right into this part of Phoenix. I'd like to steal stuff for my place, if I'm honest. Bar stools and light fixtures, then the tables.   I got a tour of the kitchen during one of my visits- four dozen pizza ovens, all expected to be going at once to keep up with demand from diners and to-go orders. They've brought in experienced crews from their Chicago stores and plan to expand aggressively in the Valley Of The Sun. Gotta wish them well on that because I'm a big fan.",

We waited at the hostess stand for several minutes, to be informed there was ANOTHER hostess stand further into the dining area where we would need to check in to be seated. (Which now several people had passed us, and another line had formed) There are no clear signs informing of where to check in.  Pizza: We ordered the classic deep dish, their signature dish with added pepperoni. The crust is a buttered crust, which was my favorite part of the whole pizza! The sauce was a simple basic marinara, but overall dry. I wish they had more sauce on top, or layered in the pizza. A decent pizza, but nothing overly special or crazy!  The wait time once we had sat down was about 30 minutes, keep that in mind if you plan on ordering a deep dish- as they do have an order ahead option we did not know of, which will save you loads of time!   Overall, cute interior and VERY family oriented. The atmosphere was loud and slightly cramped, as it seems a hot spot for families to come and enjoy and watch football in the background. I won't be craving the pizza, but would still come back!",

    "text": "Lou's is fantastic!  We went on a Thursday at 5:00PM with a friend and still waited about 15 minutes as every table inside was full.  We were offered immediate seating outside on what looks like a beautiful patio, but it was just too hot to enjoy. We left at 7:00 and the place was packed, every table inside and out was full and it was about an hour wait at that point.  I recommend getting there early!  We were seated at a comfortable booth big enough for four people.  It is a trendy modern decor but still warm an inviting.  They did a really nice job.  The only downfall for me was the restroom situation.  They have one single bathroom in the lobby.  With a packed house, its slightly awkward to ask people if they are waiting for the restroom or a table.  It is also very subtle with just a M/W on the door, so imagine the weird looks I got when asking because people didn't even know they were standing right next to it.  (Perhaps there are hidden restrooms behind the closed doors to the kitchen, but I was directed to the one in the lobby.)  Moving on to the good stuff... We started with the regular size Malnati Salad.  Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits and gorgonzola cheese with our Sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese. $8.75  |  Family size $12.95 This salad was excellent. Crisp lettuce, fresh ingredients, delicious! I couldn't stop eating it.  This size was perfect for two people.    For the main event we ordered the medium Malnati Chicago Classic.   Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  It's authentic Chicago!  Personal (serves 1) $9.35 Small (serves 2) $14.95 Medium (serves 3) $19.95 Large (serves 4) $23.95  We added pepperoni to our pizza, but truthfully it didn't need it.  The pizza would have been plenty flavorful as is.  I would imagine this is why pepperoni isn't on it to begin with.  This deep dish favorite is fabulous!  Loaded with cheese!  Highly recommended!  The medium easily serves three people as shown.  It is cut into six slices, we each had two and took two home.  Perfect!    They do offer other things like pastas and sandwiches, but why would you not have pizza?  Especially deep dish pizza!  They do offer thin crust, but I wouldn't do it!    Sorry I can't report on dessert, just didn't have room!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "4:30PM - We placed our order online. Their site was easy to navigate but it really bugged me that they didn't put the actual size of the pizza online (ie. 7'' diameter, etc). Instead, there were suggested serving sizes. A small serves 2-3, it said. Well, I guess a small will do. Deep dish? Yes. The Malnati Chicago Classic, please. Uncut is better for take out, you say? Uncut it is, then. 6:15PM - Scheduled pick up.  I personally didn't pick up the pizza, so I can't speak for the ambience of the restaurant. However, the hubby did tell me the line for dining in was ree-di-cu-lous. At least an hour's wait, he guessed. The pick up line was a tad shorter but still fairly long, from what I hear.  Now fast forward to where I finally get to see the pizza in person. 30 minutes after the hubby picked it up. It wasn't as deep as I had expected and strangely, the tomato sauce didn't cover our entire pizza (Maybe the toppings shifted on the drive home?). But it was delicious nonetheless. We cut up the pizza ourselves and the cheese was fantastic. I'm no cheese connoisseur, but I eat enough pizzas to say this was some damn good mozzarella. Unlike your usual pizza, the cheese comes into direct contact with the crust, with the sausage and tomato sauce sitting above the cheese. The small was perfect for the two of us too. It was just filling enough and a medium probably would have put my stomach's capacity to the test. Did I mention that the crust had enough of a crisp but with some chewiness to remind you that this was indeed a deep dish and not a thin crust.  I most definitely will be back!",

We got lucky and the hostess helped us snag a couple seats at the bar as a couple people left, otherwise the wait was at least an hour. We ordered a couple drinks, an appetizer, and a deep dish pepperoni. It was all very good. The pizza looks amazing as they brought it out. Thick, well sauced, and a good topping to cheese ratio. The thing that I really surprised me though was how light the dough was for such a thick pizza. It a was a pleasant surprise. The bartenders we worked with were very helpful and we had a great experience. We will return.",

I'm more of a pasta person but Chicagos deep dish pizza came to Arizona, and being from Chicago my friend and I decided to come try this place out. I grew up in Chicago but never tried this pizza joint because pizza wasn't my thing.   My overdue Chicago deep dish pizza experience: it was amazing! We ordered some bruschetta for appetizer and a 2 person 'The Lou' pizza. It comes with spinach, mushrooms, and a ton of cheese and tomatoes and extra deliciousness!   I was honestly surprised I enjoyed every bite of that pizza and I believe I over indulged as I needed to unbutton my pants afterwards. It's not your ordinary pizza and it will blow away those of you that don't normally go for pizza either.   The service here is 5 star worthy! Our server was very friendly and explained that he is from Chicago and moved here 6 years ago. Once he heard Lou Malnatis was opening up, he quit his job and decided to work here.   I accidentally spilled my beer as soon as I got it and EVERY worker was rushing to our table to help and ask if we were okay and asked if they could get me a refill. I can't say enough how they all worked together to get everything tidied up! One guy came to mop, another came to clean and dry the table, someone brung new plates and utensils, and two ladies at different times came and asked if they could bring me another beer. Excellent service!   I'm curious to try their pasta next! Way to represent!",

I've never been to Chicago nor have anything to compare this too other than Pizza Hut or CPK!  That's the only pizza I've been around and in San Diego! But, this pizza was aaammmmaaazzziinnngg!  Upon our arrival it was super crowded, people outside with their family members waiting outside at least there are chairs and a nice grassy area for kids to run around. The crowd well it's too be expected since I heard this is the first Chicago deep dish pizza in the desert/valley area and they recently opened last week, so it's a new hype place!   Well, as we were entering and placing our name on the one hour wait list. There were two seats opening up at the bar and we gracefully went over to grab it and crossed our name off the wait list and decided to have beers and our dinner there with Nikki, Holly, and the rest of the gang! This was sooo nice if you don't have kids go straight to the bar much faster beats the wait list.   Nikki and Holly were sooo very nice, upbeat, super friendly, courteous, having fun, and very conversational! Don't you hate it when sometimes you go to the bar and the bartenders are such duds with no personality... Well, not here total opposite and loved every minute I was sitting at the bar!   Nikki had suggested we try the buffalo green salad and I'm so very thankful we did! Gosh, what a interesting mix of greens. It had buffalo (which normally I don't care to eat), gorgonzola cheese, their delicious house dressing mixed, and watermelon. It was the best tasting salad I've had in Phoenix & the first time to try it with all these different Flavors. It was sooo yummy!!!  On to the pizza, we had to stick to the original deep dish pizza with the butter crust. We figure we ordered the medium pizza (serves about 3ppl) I told my husband get the small size because I'm not a big eater, literally one slice is normally my limit! Lol and sure enough the taste and my first bite into the sauce, cheese, and crust was just yummy! Flavors of all sorts was dancing around and it was almost melting in my mouth as I devoured one piece! It was sooo huge and plenty! I also think having a few beers didn't help the process of me wanting to have another piece! I was a happy camper!   I really enjoyed last nights dinner, I enjoyed being out, and trying something sooo new! Can't wait for my kids to come up and take them over here to try some Chicago pizza!   Mahalo Nikki and Holly (I hope I'm saying your names correctly) for making our night fun!",

Now I live in the west valley, been trying to find a good pizza joint since we moved here from SoCal about six years ago. We have a couple of places that are good, however nothing to brag about. Since I work in Phoenix, Lou's is pretty close to me. So it works out! I decided to order carry out. Place looks awesome, they have a huge outdoor area. And the pizza? Taste as good if I bought it from Chicago! Love their deep dish butter crust! The ripen tomatoes add a great flavor. Glad they chose to have their water filtered the way it is in Chicago. Don't think the Phoenix water would have worked out. They went the distance to make this work here, and I hope it works out.",

Overall, It was a good experience.  The flavors of the pizza were great. I'm typically not a deep dish fan, but I really liked this.  The wait was a little long, over an hour, but there was a bar and places nearby you could go for a drink.  They use a text based buzzer system when your table is ready and you can check in from your phone.  I highly recommend using the pre-order system so that you aren't waiting another half hour at your table for your food once you get seated.",

We were seated immediately in a booth towards the back of the restaurant.  The service was efficient; the salad (Malnati) was brought quickly followed by a piping hot pizza (The Lou).

I guess the NY in me wants meatball, but that is not an option here.  Stick to the cheese as it packs a perfect slice.  Real pizza should always have the gooey cheese that keeps going and going.  Thank you Chicago for finally giving Arizona a deep dish pizza joint.  The waiters are friendly and it is fun to hear the excitement in the air of being at the restaurant.  You hear a lot of Chicago accents around you, but even us non-Illinois folks can appreciate a good pizza.   Friendly tip: if you go between 4:30 and 7:30 the wait can be crazy so be prepared as tables move slowly as the pizza takes 35-45 minutes to bake.",

For a $30 large deep-dish pepperoni-mushroom pizza, the taste of the fillings was good, but I counted only 5 pepperoni and 5 mushroom slices on 1/3 of the pizza. I've had pizza hut pizzas with more toppings. The toppings are hidden well in the tomato slices. And sadly, the crust had no taste. No salt, bland, not at all the \"buttery\" experience I expected.

The pizza, though, was underwhelming and not in line with the reviews we read and heard about. I don't think the reviews set us up unrealistically, I think the reviews were unrealistic themselves especially because we have eaten multiple times at Buddyz: A Chicago Pizzeria in Queen Creek. Their crust is more buttery, the sauce tastes better, and the sausage is tastier so all-in-all Buddyz tops Lou Malnatis. We will go back to Buddyz but not Lou's.",

At that time, it was some of the best pizza I had ever eaten, if not THE best. Since I live in the greater Los Angeles area of southern California, there really aren't any choices for authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza (there are a couple but nothing that even compare to this). While on a trip to Arizona last October, I saw an advertisement for a Lou Malnati's Pizzeria that had opened in Phoenix and knew the next time visited Arizona we would make it a point to go there. So, back visiting here again, we went there last night for dinner and, the pizza was amazing! From now on, whenever we're in Phoenix for a family visit, we will be sure to dine at this there for their awesome pizza.",

Our first impression was the hostess, who seemed to busy talking to a server to acknowledge us or take our name. After a short wait, longer than quoted, we were sat at a table that was crumb laden as was the floor. Our server was nice, she got the order right but apparently the kitchen felt we wanted our pizza over cooked. I'll not make another visit there. Overcooking  the pizza was one thing, the lack of sanitation was another. My guests from Chicago say they really prefer Giordanos.... why didn't we just go there ?",

I entered and inquired if the express lunch was available for carryout, and informed that it was dine in only. I proceeded to the next employee commenting I was there for the express lunch and would dine in but disappointed I could not do it for carryout. She informed me I could do the express lunch for carryout, and took my order of a sausage pizza, then asked if I wanted to add a drink. The drink apparently is only included with the dine in express lunch but not carryout. I wasn't thrilled but decided to purchase a drink. Then I ordered the minestrone soup and paid. After paying I inquired roughly how long it would take, the staff were unaware but checked and informed me it would be around 10 minutes. A very workable time for an express pizza. After a 10 minute wait I was approached and asked what salad dressing I wanted as the soup was unavailable. This express lunch which is a full price pizza with free drink and soup or salad now has become a full price pizza, full price can of soda, and no soup. I comment I have no interest in eating a salad, so the employee walked away without comment, returning roughly five minutes later letting me know the soup was now available and would be included. Having waited now about 15 minutes I asked her how much longer as I was initially informed it would be a 10 minute wait. My total time waiting was just under 30 minutes to receive a bag containing the pizza and soup.   When i opened up the bag to enjoy the food I found I did not receive any napkins or utensils, and the soup was unappealing. The sausage pizza was tasty, but having consumed my entire lunch break waiting for the express lunch, and paying for the included drink I didn't the experience worthwhile. I was hoping Lou Malnati's would become a regular lunch location but I doubt I'll return for lunch in the future based on both this experience and the general practice of how carryout is handled with the express lunch order.",

Now that I've gone to Lou Malnatis a few times I have to say that the pizza was only good that one time. Who ever that cook was that day they should've kept him. The dough is lousy and the pizza is just not put together right. Either too dry or not enough of the flavors added to make it tasty. One time when I ordered it to be delivered it wasn't even what I ordered and when I called them to complain they had turned their phones off!!! The restaurant was still open for another hour but yet the phone was on a answering machine that informed me they were no longer taking calls. Really!!! The staff here is more concerned about themselves then the food and their customers. Overall this is certainly not worth their high prices. I don't mind paying good money for a great pizza but this pizza isn't close to being great. There are many restaurants in Phoenix that have great food, Lou Malnatis isn't one of them.",

When getting a Lous pizza for the first time, I would recommend getting butter crust if they don't ask you, which is a standard in the chi.

It was incredible, went with the Lou. Toppings and cheeses are great. Sauce was amazing. The crust was something special, it was flaky but not too flaky, the butter they use in the description makes all the difference.",

Not only is everything delicious and the service is always fantastic, the managers (Alexa and the others) are ALWAYS walking around and checking on customers and making sure we're all happy.  If you haven't gone to Lou's, it doesn't matter if you're from Chicago or NY, it's worth every penny and every bite.  We can't wait for the Scottsdale location to open soon!!!",

    "text": "So my favorite pizza is New York style, but I have to say, this pizza was delicious!!  Went there with my hubby, son, and mom- and dad-in-law. Ordered The Malnati Chicago Classic and a classic pepperoni. Both with the butter crust (I mean, if you're going to do deep dish, you may as well go all the way). We added mushrooms to the Malnati, too.   Crust was wonderful as promised, nicely offsetting the fresh and savory sauce and the perfect amount of cheese and meat. My mouth is watering as I remember it. Great craft beer or wine to go along with it. I tend to be a purest and would order just a pepperoni wherever I go, so I preferred the pepperoni, but I enjoyed both. Waitress was awesome and the balsamic dressing for the salad was great (pizza takes a while, so salad is advised, plus, you know, it's greens).   Weirdly, my oldest son was visiting Chicago at the time and when my youngest told him he should look for this Chicago original, my oldest sent a picture of his pizza box and said he'd eaten there a few hours earlier. Thumbs up from all six of us!",

Maybe even better.. The house salad with the gorgonzola dressing is to die for. I'm not even a huge fan of salad, but that salad is delicious. The only down side is the wait, but that is understandable since they cook every pizza fresh after you order and deep dish takes a while. I'd rather wait than have a pizza that was sitting under a heater for hours. The servers are usually really nice as well!",

Don't complain about how long it makes, use that time to oh I don't know... socialize with who you came with and get off your phone? If you're going to be spending that much money might as well enjoy the ambience you're in, instead of complaining.   Outdoor seating, they have misters on for when it's really hot, they have a fireplace outside as well, for when it's too cold. Also, indoor seating. I have gone here 5 times since they opened, even though they're 45min from me I will still drive out there for my pizza. Try calling your order in before you get to the restaurant, so it starts cooking! Then your wait time won't be so long. Doesn't anyone use their brains anymore? Ha! Enjoy folks!",

I'm not sure pre-ordering our pizza saved much time - it still took 30-40 minutes from when we were seated. The building was quite open to the outside so I wonder how they deal with monsoons when dust could blow into the restaurant from the outside through the large \"garage door\" near the bar. The pizza crust was quite sturdy and I had difficulty cutting through it. Chicago style deep dish pizza has the tomato sauce on the top, sandwiching the ingredients and cheese between the bottom crust.  The tomato sauce tasted like fresh canned tomatoes and it didn't taste like marinara sauce. There were a few large television monitors in the room playing a Cubs game. Overall a delicious example of real (Chicago style) deep dish pizza.",

    "text": "Just like the ones back in Chicago. They're doing it right. They've got the flavors down, the pH of the water matched. Service was typically terrific, attentive, professional but casual, like it should be. The family behind this growing pizza empire truly cares about quality. You will not find a better Chicago pizza anywhere else.   This place is gonna be mighty popular once it opens to the public. Expect a long wait during popular times and a moderate wait at all other times, though there is a lot of seating so it might not be terrible during off peak times. No reservations, but you can order your pizza when you show up so your wait for the food at the table is not as long.   They offer carryout, delivery (within certain boundaries), and frozen pies to cook at home (so very good, almost as good as in the restaurant, but not quite).   Only open for dinner, but I expect them to eventually open for lunch too.",

It was perfect for 5 of us and the college kid 2 slices home (ordered large). Our great server was Jordan! Always had drinks and anything we needed. Was very friendly and quick. The family loved interacting with him. We will def be coming back! We had no waiting at 2pm!",

Mmmm good. Did I say good? Meant outrageous. Meant to say it was as good if not better than eating in Highland Park, IL. Met Pete the district mgr from Oak Park. What a gentleman. So calm considering the restaurant was hopping with customers and staff. Eating Lou's makes me realize how much I have missed 'home cooking'. Hoping that they will open a second location in North Scottsdale. Oh, btw....we were advised to not have the pie cut so that it will travel easier in the car. When we got home, followed the heating instructions on the box. So easy. So tasty. So happy that we also purchased another fully baked pizza and an additional 4 frozen pizza's as well.",

We arrived at 7:05pm and had to wait outside for our table until 7:20pm. Once we were seated we figured we had already ordered almost two hours ago and our food should arrive \"shortly.\"  It didn't. We had 5 very hungry kids at our table. Our pizza didn't arrive until almost 820pm. I know it's a deep dish but 3 hours for a pizza is a little unheard of, right? It was very good- I will say that. We ordered the Lou special and a pepperoni/ sausage. Both were very good. The kids shared a small cheese and a gluten free sausage. They seemed to enjoy those as well. I would rate the restaurant a 4 star but I don't feel 3 hours for a pizza deserves 4 stars. I was a little dissatisfied with that part of it. What's the point of calling before hand if you're still having to wait 1.5 hrs more? :(",

I even taunted friends who have moved outside of the Chicagoland area that we have the first Lou's outside of IL and was extremely lucky to score a ticket to the soft opening.  First of all, Lou's deserves 10 stars for donating all proceeds of their soft opening to Phoenix Children's Hospital.  All participants of the soft opening paid for their food and Lou's then donated those funds to PCH.  Class Act.  Lou's in the desert is just as good as Lou's back home.  The boy tried the thin crust pizza (which almost seemed sacrilegious) but he said it was one of the best thin crusts he has ever had.  I got the Chicago Classic and it was just as good as I remembered.    The decor here is fun, they really did a nice job in the PHX mod feeling they added to the ambiance.  My only disappointment were the TV's in the dining room, definitely NOT a PHX norm unless you are a sports bar.  We are really excited about new addition to PHX.  Keep it up, Lou's!",

    "text": "I know literally nothing about \"authentic\" (or even good) deep dish pizza. In fact, I'm was a deep dish virgin before going to Lou's. Just gonna throw that out there before I get to reviewing.  The property is adorbs. Lots of great spaces for larger groups, a wrap around bar, a nice patio and plenty of booths for annoying people like me who insist on one. Oh! While we're on the booth subject, I love that the two-top booth has a slightly extended table so you're not super squished and you can comfortably gorge on all the foods.  Our service was different, but overall good. Being in the industry, I was a total judgmental asshole when Donny seemed a little scatterbrained at first and said he was having an off night. He ended up hitting every step of service perfectly and we enjoyed the experience with him.   So where are we? Atmosphere... Check! Service.. Check!! Ahh but the food. No checks from me Lou! The wings were for sure overpriced- $9ish for 6. Their sauce was good but the texture was off- limp skin like the fat underneath wasn't rendered out in the fryer enough. The pizza (remember I'm no expert) was different than I'm used to as a native Phoenician, but not something I'd ever get again. The deep dish butter crust on the Classic was a cross between French bread and actual pie crust- not much flavor and too dense for my taste. I did like how they mix it up with sauce on top, a thin layer of sausage across the whole 'za and cheese closest to the crust. Also had the pizza cookie (could only eat one slice of pizza & I'm 39 weeks pregnant & why the hell am I explaining myself to you?) Anyway- it was fine but I'll stick to the OG in these parts and head to Oreganos.",

We had a kickass month of sales at my Verizon Wireless location and they were willing to take us here, everything on them. So, the other day we went, and i was very excited to try this place out. We get there, i survey the menu in a very unorthodox manner, not knowing what to purchase. I go for the good ol' classic OG throwback Chicago style deep dish with sausage. The menu clarified that the pizzas take a while to cook, so i was patient for the food. I was able to eat 3 slices max due to the fact of how deep the slices really were. The pies are pretty pricey but definitely are worth the bargain. They weren't THE best I've ever had but I'd put it in my top 3, maybe 4 for sure. Only negative was the waiter was kind of weird, ( no disrespect ) and the crust is too hard. Overall a great place to venture to for sure.",

Was given a voucher for a free pizza and to call when ordering instead of using on line ordering. I then called a month later to order another pizza. I put in my order and was put on hold for 10 minutes. Five different people picked up and asked me if I was preordering for dine in, which I then told them I already ordered and was waiting to pay. The manager then picked up and asked me the same question. She then stated that I had to reorder. By that point I told her that I was not interested anymore. She apologized for \"ruining my evening\", which was her sarcastic reply to me when I said I was not interested in ordering from them. I am not sure what has happened to this place, but there is obvious incompetence issues with the staff. This never happened in Chicago. I am extremely disappointed in the service or lack there of. You'd think it was easier to order online, but then you get delivery drivers who don't hold down the pizza properly. You then get told to call for delivery, but the people answering the phones can't seem to do their job either. I guess Marc Malnati is making enough money not to care about the customers anymore....Federal Pizza is across the street and their service is excellent! Lou's should take notice that there are plenty of other pizza places in that area or their service will start being compared to Pizza Hut! Ridiculous.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to trying Lou Malnati's ever since I heard it was opening in my favorite 'hood: uptown Phoenix!   First, I like the location: tucked back in a corner of Uptown Plaza, with a big lawn area and fountain out front. The inside is cute - industrial 50s-ish style.  We planned ahead and got there right at opening (11:00) on a Saturday. It was no problem seating our big group, although we would definitely have had to wait if we were there at 11:20 or later. FYI, the deep dish pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook (you can order while you wait for your table!). We tried the stuffed spinach loaf and the cheese bread while we waited - both were delicious. We also enjoyed a couple local brews from Wren House and Phoenix Ale Co.   And seriously, the pizza is really good. We tried both sausage (the special) and pepperoni and enjoyed both. The toppings cover an entire layer of the pizza, so you never have to get even one bite without, and I think the special comes with extra cheese, which is also delicious. The waitress recommended the butter crust, and I'm glad she did because it really made the pie. I don't think it would be great for takeout because the toppings really start sliding off the crust after just a few minutes - no wonder the waitress serves every piece for you. She's a pro.  Be warned, these slices are very filling. They say a large will feed 3-4 people on the menu, but I think it's more like 6.  It takes some planning to avoid the long lines, but I wouldn't mind returning to Lou Malnati's next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "\"When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie, that's amore.\"  After a night out on the town with my crew, we were feeling a little hungry and we couldn't decide where to go, so we all decided to see what the hype on Lou Malnati's was all about, and trust me, the hype is real!   After walking in, we were greeted and the staff was extra friendly. They even had samples for you to try out while you were in line! The wait wasn't so bad this time, about 30 minutes. I also absolutely adored the decor, very modern and city, yet still cozy. It was also very packed but it felt extremely roomy and not at all snug. They also allow you to order your pizza ahead of time so that your pizza is closer to being done since it takes longer for your pizza to be made than it does to be seated. FRESH. As for pizza, my sister in law and I ordered \"The Lou\" and I thought it was the grand masterpiece of all vegetarian pizzas. There was 3 cheeses, mushrooms, spinach and fresh tomatoes as toppings. I wouldn't have minded if it was my last meal. It's that stinking good! The cheese was amazing too! That ooey gooey type. As for appetizers, we got the Malnati salad, with ingredients very similar to any antipasto salad, but this salad was definitely on point, crisp, and refreshing. We also got the buffalou wings and they were were gone in a jiffy, I liked them very much because it was the right amount of tart and spice. Lastly we also shared the combination platter with our group and that had batter fried mushrooms, cheddar, mozzarella and zucchini, also none left behind.   I even asked my friends, \"you know when you go to that great restaurant and you always find that one dish that's eh?\" Or \"it's alright, it's not all great.\" As of now I can say Lou Malnati's does not have \"that\" dish! I enjoyed all of our dishes.   The pricing was quite alright too! For the price we paid, we definitely got our money's worth since the portions are so large.   My experience was so great here! It must be something in the water, no literally! Their food is prepared with  Chicago PH altered water, tomatoes and other ingredients shipped here from Chicago for that Chicago styled greatness. Cool huh?!   I've never been to Chicago, but I can definitely say that I've tried Chicago style pizza, and it won't be the last time!",

    "text": "I am from the Chicago Suburbs and love me some deep dish. This place is great and the pizza tasted as I remembered it. The issue I have is the size of the restaurant and the fact that there are basically two waits you have to go through. It was misleading. First you have to wait outside for 30 minutes, then you get inside and they hostess takes your name down on a tablet and tells you there is another 45 minute wait.  Once we got a text that our table was ready I went up to the check in desk and was asked if we pre-ordered our pizza. Umm nooooo, nobody asked me so how would I have known to do that.  The inside dining room is very small. Like tiny. The pizza tasted great and if thats all that matters then its a 5 stars, but the surrounding issues should make some pause to re-plan for a day they can waste.  Overall it was a long day, but great food.",

But to have it down the street from my house is even more amazing!. Ahhhhhh.  Alright, let's see. Where do I begin, Grand opening was today. The line was ridiculous. An hour wait, waiting outside while the line loops around to the restaurant. Then another 40 minute wait inside... lame I know. We were at the restaurant for 3 1/2 hours. Including the wait and as we dine in.   The decor was so simple and so family-friendly.  Love the \"say cheese\" sign.The mirror made the room look so much bigger.  We had to order our pizza before sitting down because it would take awhile. My family ordered Penne alla Vodka, honey bbq wings, and butter crust pepperoni pizza. Chicago style of course. They loved it. No complaint there. Had to bring pizza to go of course. It's so full and filling  I ordered the personal vegetarian pizza call \" The lou\" with no parmigiano. I had to educate the girls at the desk why I can't have parmigiano, well, here's why. because it has RENNET in it. They looked at me like I was crazy..... So yeah... they didn't know what it was until I said it was stomach from baby calves. They both were grossed out. Haha. I hope they know next time I come in.  I'LL BE BACK!!!!!  It's not a good thing for a Vietnamese female to be fat and loving pizza... but i do. *smile*",

    "text": "I'm so excited for some new not chained  restaurants opening here in Arizona! And none other than my favorite city Chicago! Did I mention it's Chicago style pizza?!   Lous doesn't open till 4pm but it's changing to lunch soon. I showed up 10 mins before and the line was out the door. I only waited 10 mins and was told to go straight to the dining room hostess. I was seated and greeted with a smile from both the hostess and the waiter Donald who happens to be from Chicago!  With great company with my friend who is from the city and the waiter who is from there as well my service was off to great start.   The decor was pretty neat, bright signs and a very cool divey sorta feel, really sets the environment up for you. They got misters going outside for the patio seating which is really nice as well, lot of room. You walk in and right away you notice who is a fan of Chicago or from Chicago. A lot of people sporting the Windy City gear.    My friend and I ordered a beer and when it arrived my friend accidentally spilled her beer all over the table, floor and seat. Automatically we had two managers, two waiters and two bussers cleaning up our table, mopping the floor, wiping the seats. One manager brought my friend a fresh beer, another manager came up asked if she could replace it. I mean the service was excellent right off despite our mess.  Our table was cleaned, new plates, new silverware, new beer less than 3 minutes! Talk about WOWing your customer with service. I felt like royalty, even though we messed up :)   We order fresh bruschetta( my favorite) and it was simple and delicious. The bread wasn't hard to the bite and was crisp to perfection.  While eating our appetizer and sipping on our beer we were asked multiple times (not overwhelming) how our food was and if we needed anything.  Deep dish pizza takes time depending on size. We ordered a small ( feeds 2 about 4 slices) which was perfect for us. It took about 35 minutes, we ordered the The famous  Lou pizza  which is spinach, layers of mozzarella, mushrooms, fresh sweet Roma tomatoes with tomato sauce and  cheddar cheese! Delicious! The manager brought out our deep dish pizza, cut it up and even placed it on our individual plates!   Overall I was WOWED with the decor, the customer service and the food! Definitely worth your time and money and ask to be seated with Donald!",

    "text": "Well well well....what kind of pizza do we have here!? Family was raving about the place so we had to try. It was a very long wait, and we couldn't make a reservation as it wasn't allowed even with a large party. Inside/outside seating was a great option specially with the weather in Phoenix in September. My wife is pregnant and was starving so immediately after being seated we ordered the combo platter, and a minestrone soup for her. The soup serving size was literally a tea cup.  Unfortunately, I have nothing to say about it besides don't disappoint yourself and order it. Flavorless. The combo platter had a deep fried assortment of cheese sticks, squares, zucchini and mushrooms with ranch and marinara. The cheese squares were over cooked and not melted. The rest, well was just deep fried lol. We created our own pizza, pepperoni, mushrooms, tomato, sausage, and spinach. Upon arrival it smelled amazing but looked rather watery on the top. I'm not sure what caused that. Our waiter was nice and served the slices, very large. The pizza was so so, it seemed to have less flavor than what the smell gave off. I ate one slice and was full. It was a decent pizza, but if I go again I'll definitely switch it up to see if the result is better. I say go try the place because it's cool, and hopefully your choices come out better than mine did.",

Sadly, my work was 1 mile outside of their delivery radius, so I had to go pick it up. I even offered to pay extra to get them to bring it to my building, but no luck! It made me sad to pick it up because after I saw how busy the bar and the restaurant were (Friday night), I really wanted to eat in!! Talk about FOMO.   We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza, thin crust. Lou Malnati's is known for their high-quality ingredients and I can tell you that the sausage was very fresh and worth every penny. The slices were cut skinny enough that I didn't feel guilty about eating 4 of them. My coworkers got buffalo wings on the side. The wings came with bleu cheese dressing and they said the dressing was SO GOOD! They wouldn't shut up about that dressing for the rest of our shift at work.  Don't miss Lou Malnati's for their deep dish pizza (great in the restaurant, but not so great as take-out). But, definitely order thin crust if ordering to go. Enjoy the pie!",

We've been here so many time since they've opened and it's been great service and great food every single time. Always come here and get the butter crush and an app to share. Never gets old. The quality of food here is always stellar. I'm very happy that they're opening a closer location to my house. Yay Lou's!",

Today Lou's was firing on all cylinders, and the Restaurant was Smooth as silk.  Service was top notch, patient and attentive, and my favorite quality's, welcoming and kind!!!  We had a big salad The Lou, This is one of The Cities greatest salads and has all of my favorite things. This is a cant miss item. Great Cheesy garlic bread set the tone for the starring attraction The Pizza.  I brought my favorite Chicago sons with me to share and it was unanimous and rousing 11 thumbs up (on a 1-10 scale). We all talked about \"The String\" that all great deep dish pizzas should have. and then...wait for it... there it was, a foot long string of cheese as the first slice was lifted from the well seasoned pan.  The crust was better then I remember and the sauce was great, a little puddling of water was a surprise since we had meat pizzas, but that didn't distract from these excellent Pizza's  Crowds have subsided and that's a relief, no wait at all. Lou's in my opinion is finally poised to grow around the valley. let me give you my address because we traveled 15 miles for lunch today.",

The atmosphere was great and I loved all the fun decor. Our service was great and very friendly. The salad was delicious and we enjoyed our pizza. I give it four stars instead of five because the pizza was good, but the sauce definitely left me a little wanting. I also love pineapple on my pizza and they do not offer that, not a deal breaker but definitely disappointing. The portions were huge and we had plenty of leftovers. There is also a decent beer draft list which is a huge plus. We would definitely go back here. It was also a great place to take our kids.",

I didn't care for the vibe and location, felt really commercial and impersonal.  I ordered a deep dish pizza with spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes. There were little to no mushrooms what so ever. The pizza was soggy as if the veggies were water-logged before placing them on the pizza. I also didn't care for the corn meal crust, which was practically inedible wet.  I paid around $20 for a small pizza. The small is cut into four slices. It seemed a little larger than a personal pan pizza from the chain restaurant. The taste was also comparable.  Certainly didn't find my favorite local pizza place here.",

The pizza was still warm, but the cheese suffered. It wasn't stringy or melted at all. I liked all the toppings. It's just the crust was lacking. It just seemed like bread. It wasn't crispy or crunchy. It was just like table bread. There were options when ordering online for what crust you wanted. I expected the regular crust to be a least a little crunchy, but it wasn't at all. If we eat here again we're totally getting the super crispy crust.",

    "text": "\"This is pizza heaven!\" Those words actually came out of my mouth during my first meal at the infamous Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. I finally had a chance to sample their deep dish offerings, thanks to my friend who chose the Uptown location to celebrate his birthday. I was more than a little excited when he chose this destination.  There are probably a fair number of Phoenicians who are irritated with the influx of all things Chicago. What can I say? Either you recognize a blessing or you don't, and you can go back to New York... I kid. Let me just say, this is the kind of pizza I knew existed, and I've been waiting all my life to enjoy.  Perhaps you are familiar with the mostly defunct chain Pizzeria Uno (also out of Chicago). That was my previous favorite pizzeria. I was saddened by their bankruptcy and retreat from Arizona. With Lou Malnati's in the valley, I am no longer sad.  We started our meal by ordering \"The Lou\" (which is their \"vegetarian\" option) before our appetizer. Cook times vary depending on how busy they are. Our pizza featured spinach, garlic, mushrooms, sliced tomatoes and three cheeses. Daniel our server, made a great suggestion to cook it an extra five minutes to get a crispier crust. The crust was unforgettable!  The fried calamari was one of the better versions of this classic appetizer that I've enjoyed. But I cannot stop talking about the pizza! The cheese was gooey, the fillings were delicious! The mushrooms were plump and fresh, and the chunky tomato sauce was awesome. But that crust... I've never eaten a slice of pizza before, where after I ate the crust, that I went looking for more \"pizza bones\".  Not only was the pizza outstanding, but desert was equally impressive! What better way to wrap up a rich meal than with something refreshing, like a slice of Key Lime pie? And Daniel's service was spot on. In summary, I've eaten other deep dish pizzas that finished like a brick. There is something special about Lou Malnati's. Chicago knows pizza!",

I have eaten at almost every Lou's in Chicagoland at some point in my life...then I followed my parents to the desert and great deep dish became a thing of the past...  I live in Tucson. Today we were passing though Phoenix during rush hour on our way home from up north. So, we decided to stop and give this Lou Malnati's a try. I was skeptical given the other \"Chicago\" chains that seemed to pop up from time to time in Tucson.   We walked in and the Decor was awesome. We were greeted and everyone was really really friendly. We ordered a sampler of fried goodness which included the fried cheddar cubes if known in my youth. Unfortunately, I have had to stop eating red meat so we could get their sausage (the classic) pizza. I noticed they had \"the Lou\" which is essentially their veggie pizza. It came piping hot and the first slice was served to us, as is tradition. The pizza was just as I remembered it including the wonderful butter crust! We also got a tiramisu to share which was creamy and delicious.  I tip my Cubs World Series hat to you, Lou Malnati's Pizzeria in Phoenix. You have definitely brought a piece of the Windy City our way!",

My one and only reason to want to dine here is because I saw in other reviews that they have a crustless pizza (suitable for keto/low carb diet). So this pizza, instead of having a bread crust, it is make on a big sausage patty. The only down side is that it needs to be eaten with fork and knife... at least for the large version. Maybe the individual version can be eaten holding the slice. We were lucky and arrived here before the lines started to form. We were seated right away (Saturday, 4pm ish). The place is big, but did not get very loud. It was nice level of noise to keep a conversation going. Overall a good experience. It is awesome that they have a low carb option.",

The pizza takes long to come out which is expected. When the pizza does come out it is soooo amazing. The sausage isn't salty, the cheese is melted perfectly, the crust isn't tough or burnt. All in all I'll be a return customer.   I love the option to order to other states! It comes frozen in a box & although it is pricey, it is worth it!

The last time I went to Malnati's, up in Scottsdale rd, I was so focused on the pizza and the experience that I was a little miffed when someone asked if I could move down a chair at the bar. I didn't mean to be, but I snapped just a bit. This is Chicago to me. Ive spent a lot of time in Chicago and purposely went to a lot of recommended pizza places, but Malnati's delivers a pie that is delectable. Today, as if this was the last meal of my life, it had to be a Malnati's. Here's what sux: Chicago has over a hundred craft breweries; I know because I've sought them out, like the pizzerias. I'm a little manic that way. Phoenix has only 40-some, but we have some terrific beer brewed in the valley.  Malnati's corporate needs to get a clue - beer is just as important as pizza, and attention needs to be paid to having a great rotating selection of local beers.  Please mix it it up. Please regularly change the handles. Get some Arizona Wilderness, 8-Bit, Dark Sky, Wanderlust, North Mountain. Wve got so many good breweries, and so many good beers, it's a shame that I have to consider the paucity of selection when I'm considering Malnati's for pizza.",

Unfortunately much was to be desired. I ordered the Lou's deep dish pizza (a veggie option for the non-meat eaters which was appreciated) however it simply did not taste very good. My friend and I tried to eat at least a quarter of it to spare our waiters feelings and decided to get it to go (in the trash). However, there are many pros to this place as well. The atmosphere was really good and our server was attentive and polite. Although I shall not be returning to Lou's, I can see why others enjoy it and choose to go back.",

    "text": "Apparently this place is highly raved about. I would say our experience was nothing special. I like the way the bar is set up and the outside patio looked comfortable. We sat at the bar, the bartender was nice, he seemed busy. We decided on the classic Lou with pepperoni and sausage, he said it would take 35 minutes which makes sense for a deep dish. When we got to eating, it was just an average pizza. The only \"deep dish\" part of it was the crust which was too hard to even bite into. They gave us a good portion of sausage but barely any pepperoni. For the price you pay, I would try somewhere else.  Side note: our phone died and we needed a charger for just a minute so we could order an uber to our hotel :( we asked the hostesses and they said \"oh, i think everyone has iphones\" and didn't care at all. I understand it's totally not their problem but I worked in the restaurant industry for years and if someone had asked me that I would have asked the servers or cooks if someone could help them out real quick. We walked next door to creamistry and they were more than happy to charge it for us. Oh well.",

    "text": "We sat on the patio this weekend to enjoy the great weather. Immediately we noticed all of the seat cushions in our area were stained in numerous places. Definitely not a great first impression and how does this go unnoticed by management?! No one wants to sit on a dirty cushion. What's more if your cushions are that dirty it makes me wonder just how dirty your back of house is where patrons cannot see!?  MANAGEMENT, take note. SERVERS, take initiative and don't penalize the rest of the employees that are attentive and do their job well. YOU are supposed to create a great experience for paying patrons...  The let downs: The service from OUR server was very disappointing. While we overheard another server offer straws, pizza servers, Parmesan and the other customary items to her patrons, we had to ask our server numerous times for all of this - such an annoyance! What's more, when we asked for a pizza server she didn't understand why we wanted one. Huh!? Pizza should be served with utensils, no matter what size pizza is ordered. While I don't think her lack of service was intentional, it's clear she didn't care enough to be responsive and attentive, as is always the expectation when dining out!   The combo platter appetizer gets a THUMBS DOWN! When it was served all 4 of the items on the plate looked the same - the same dense breading with just about the same color but different shapes (mushrooms/mozz sticks/cheese bites/zucchini). We took a few bites that confirmed just how unappetizing they were. A mushroom was cold and the cheese bites tasted like Velveeta - yuck! I would have expected better. I blatantly asked the server if they were from a bag and she did not know the answer. A good server should know this. And, a good restaurant shouldn't serve such unappetizing food!  The better of our experience: The thin crust pizza was good - still on the thicker side of crusts, but it has a good crunch and the toppings with cheese created an abundance of flavor. The sausage was tasty and moist.  We expected more from the deep dish spinach pizza. It was good, but I presumed it would pack a big flavor punch because of the medley of veggies and garlic.   The new location is closer to us which I am willing to bet would provide a better experience all around - after this we don't feel a need to go back.",

My friends and I ordered the medium pepperoni deep dish pizza with butter crust (serves 3). As in most cases, deep dish pizza takes a while to cook, and the server warned us that it'd take about 30 mins for our pizza to come out.  The pizza itself tasted great, but I did expect it to be thicker, hence the \"deep\" in deep dish. It was smaller/thinner than other deep dish pizzas I've had. However, the food itself was yummy. The pepperoni, tomato sauce, crust, and most importantly, cheese came together all so perfectly. I would come back again and try other pizzas here!   Parking is free & shared with a bunch of other dining and shopping in the area.",

The wait was one hour on a Sunday night but I'm not going to take a star off for being popular. The front desk service was slow even just to be put on the wait list. Preorder either before you arrive or before you sit down, so your food gets on the table once you sit down. The pizza usually takes approximately 45mins from the time you place your order. Order your salads and appetizers at the table.  For appetizers, for got the calamari fritti. The breading was light and the sauce was salsa/tomato-like. Definitely different than any other calamari I've ever had. The Malnati salad was filled with bunch of ingredients.  The small was plenty to split amongst our table of 4. We went with the Malnati Chicago Classic, an extra cheesy pan cooked deep dish pizza with sausage and buttery crust. We got the large for $24. One slice was more than enough for us after all the appetizers. Overall, better than Oregano's but not like the Giordano's I ate in Chicago.",

The wait for dinner on a Sunday was about 25-30 minutes which was totally okay for us. They're fairly new & popular.  The classic Chicago pizza was delicious. It says on the menu the large deep dish (comes with 6 slices) can feed 3-4 people. This wasn't True for us. We ended up getting chicken wing appetizers & ordered one each of their two most popular pastas thinking the pizza wouldn't be enough. To our surprise, a slice of the deep dish was actually filling. It's like lasagna thick. Super filling. I struggled to finish one slice after appetizers. We literally didn't touch the pasta. We ended up taking it home (which by the way, was deeeeelicious!!!! Even after refrigerating & throwing it in the microwave the following day).  Overall: this place is a MUST try in Uptown Phoenix. Delicious food. Great service. Very nice location. I'm in love. Los Angeles needs a Lou Malnati's!!!!",

Well as I entered this restaurant the place was popping! We had to wait for about 30 minutes since I came with a friend.  The layout was really opened I thought with a large patio and the center bar connecting it to the \"waiting room\"; since there was a main dining room to the North.    We decided to start with a bottle of wine as we sat; which I had to educate the server how to uncork, but also explained how to pour.  No big whoops!  We proceeded to order the Malnati Salad to start and the The Malnati Chicago Classic for our entree.  The salad came with romaine, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami, romano and gorgonzola cheese and tossed with a sweet vinaigrette.  Overall, a good start to our dinner since it wasn't too heavy, but also I would say very basic salad.  I would have loved an element of crunch like caramelized walnuts or some seeds.  Our Malnati's pizza came with sausage, some extra cheese and tomato sauce on a buttercrust.  The mozzarella cheese was definitely stringy and cheesy to the bite and the sausage was salty and chewy as expected.  What really popped for me was the tomato sauce, which they claim is vine-ripened tomatoes, but it had an aromatic punch with a slight hint of marinara taste.  The crust was different since it reminded me of biting into a cookie, but a different taste of course.  However, I would attribute this texture that is so alluring about Lou Malnati's pizza.  Somewhere in the psyche of our mind, I'm sure this bite triggers something in our heads that makes eating this Chicago style deep dish delectable! - Enjoy!",

The restaurant is very noisy making speaking at a table for four difficult and after realizing that we'd been sitting there for 30 minutes and still hadn't gotten our appetizers we flagged down our server and cancelled that part of the order.  When our dinners came out a bit later the ladies agreed that their salads were pretty good and we all decided that the pizzas were mediocre at best. Even before they came we had decided that next time we'd order the pizza to go rather than sit in this restaurant ever again and after tasting it we'd skip the takeout too.  To recap; noisy, friendly inefficient service and mediocre food. Not really a winning combination.",

Got to our table, our server was so nice! She already knew we had a pizza going and asked if we wanted anything else. We tried the combination platter... AMAZING! Best cheese curds I've ever had! I would come back for those! Pepperoni deep dish pizza was also amazing! I'm a cheese fan and it didn't disappoint. We all only could eat one slice, it's that filling! Took the rest home. Definitely coming back!",

Yelp pro tip: go at 730 on a Tuesday.   Inside ambiance is cool, very comfortable, a tad loud, but not enough to be annoying. I will tell you one thing DO NOT sit in the half booth tables on the left side of the room because the tables slide around on the floor during the entire meal if you barely touch them. Nothing a couple felt pads wouldn't fix....  Food was okay. We should have gotten a small pizza instead of a personal size. The personal size is wayyyyy too much crust. I would go back to try that again.   The pasta leaves a lot to be desired. We got the penne and that was enough to make look elsewhere. Very salty, very very. Dinner salad was iceberg lettuce, cucumbers dices and diced tomatoes. Egh.   For the price try Oreganos which has better salads, more pasta options and a deep dish pizza that is just as good.",

If you want the \"Real deal\", go to Tony's little Italy, in PLACENTIA, California. They have the REAL CHICAGO PIZZA.  Sorry Lou!",

I have to admit I'm not the easiest to please with cheesy cuisine specifically pizza but I truly enjoyed it. The crust while hearty was both crispy & chewy. The cheese was ooey gooey goodness & the sauce had robust flavor with chunks of tomato just the way I like it. I look forward to going back & trying the wings & the Chicago beef. YUM!",

Apparently when you check in, you are also able to place your pizza order if you know what you want so by the time you are seated, you don't have to wait much longer for your pizza - it takes about 30-45 min to bake your deep dish.  The service there was phenomenal.  Every person was extremely friendly, attentive and making sure that we were satisfied.  We ordered the french bread as an appetizer and it was sooo good.  I could've eaten more but wanted to save myself for the pizza.  Our pizza came out and we realized after several bites, noticed that it wasn't what we ordered.  Right at that moment, our server came over with our pizza and said they brought us the wrong one. They allowed us to keep that pizza on top of the one that we ordered. We just felt bad for the table that didn't get their pizza and had to wait longer for theirs to be redone.  I would definitely eat here again but would have to time it right to avoid the rush.",

We stopped by for lunch today and were pleasantly surprised to find that there was no wait. In fact they were maybe only half full. I loved the fun retro styling and colors and the service was very friendly and welcoming.   It was lunch time so we opted for the lunch special. I honestly think that is where we went wrong. The special was a personal deep dish, soup or salad and a beverage. All that for under $10 a person! I ordered the salad, the sausage deep dish and a soda and my friend had the pepperoni. The salad was good with a nice mix of chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions on top and croutons. The pizza crust seemed a little over cooked and heavy on the tomatoes and light on cheese but it was ok. I was expecting to be blown away after all the hype but found myself thinking it was just alright. It is entirely possible that when I try them again and order the butter crust I will change my story as I hear that is the way to go. We just didn't have the time to wait for it today during lunch. The personal pizzas for lunch only take 15 minutes but the big one can take over 30 minutes. I am definitely going to try them again.",

Granted I'm not from Chicago and wasn't terribly familiar with the purported \"Chicago style\", but was hoping it would be a good substitute for Zachary's Pizza from Berkeley where we are from. We picked it up to go last night and got a deep dish with some veggie toppings and butter crust. The gal taking my order by phone sounded like a ditzy teenager and was not knowledgeable about the menu or particularly helpful. Every question I asked was relayed back to someone else before replying. We also ordered the Malnati salad. When we got the pizza home I found it pretty under cooked, pale, anemic and soggy on the bottom. It didn't really seem very \"deep\" for a deep dish - kind of sad actually. A thin layer of cheese and sauce - more of the crust than anything else. It had a strange metallic taste - canned tomatoes?  And really needed salt. Overall very blah. The salad was generous and fresh - the medium was more than enough for two people to share and I liked the dressing. My two stars is based mostly on the salad and cutting them a bit of slack because maybe I just \"don't get it\". I'll stick with my wood fired pizzas from Bianco and Parlor. Oh well...",

I guess I'm not a fan of Chicago deep dish (this is my first one) because it really didn't appeal to me.  The menu wasn't very extensive at lunch either, but covered most of the bases.",

    "text": "So, I'll start saying the decor is awesome.  Love it!  I'm a lover of pizza thru and thru and I was dying to try this place out.  I've been to Lou's Chicago rivals, Gino's East and Giordano's, so I had high hopes for this place.  When we arrived they quoted us a super long wait even though it was early (5:30pm) and hardly anyone in the place.  It almost felt like they wanted to feed the \"hype\" (just my opinion) or maybe they wanted us to cave and sit outside \"immediately\" even though it was a billion degrees outside.....but we ended up waiting about half the time they quoted us and got to sit indoors.  Here's when things went downhill.  Our waiter never showed.  For like 10 minutes!  That's a long time to wait to even place a drink order.  My husband had to go and find a random waiter to say we hadn't been waited on.  Finally our waitress showed up.  Things got a little better, but when you are going to wait 40 min for pizza after you've waited 10+ minutes for someone to simply greet you......your patience starts to run out.  So the service was about a 2-star service.  The Lou's salad was really good and the pizza was definitely just ok.  The crust was hard as a rock.  We ordered butter crust and expected it to be a little flaky...like crispy out outside with a little chewiness inside.....but it was just hard and crumbly.  I don't know if that's the way it's suppose to be or if that's typical for their deep dish pizza?!?  Kind of hesitant to even go back and give it a second try after the service we received though.",

    "text": "I've been enjoying Lou Malnati's pizza since the early 70's and hated not having one around the corner when we moved to the greater Phoenix area.  A few other Chicago pizza joints have tried and totally failed when it came to recreating what us Chicagoans are used to enjoying.    After going to the opening last Saturday night, I was more than pleasantly surprised that they absolutely nailed it.  They must of spent a ton of money on a water filtration system.  I have to use bottled water when I make homemade pizza for the family because AZ water is so bad in most neighborhoods.  Bad water effects so many things in a restaurant from the ice in your drink to the soups, pasta, rice, dough or anything else that needs it.  While I refused to waste space in my tummy with a soup, salad or appetizer, I did taste some of the pass around apps my friends ordered.  All of them were very tasty and my favorite was the Cheddar Cubes.  The pizza with the butter crust is my favorite.  Nobody was able to talk to me the first 5 minutes after the pizza arrived.  I disappeared and went to heaven for a moment.  It was a pleasure seeing Marc Malnati there with his wife.  His staff (mostly from Chicago) did a great job.  Kudos to the executive who talked Marc into expanding outside of the Chicago area.  All of us in the valley that love great deep dish pizza owe you a drink!  Marc is a very hands on operator, similar to Dick Portillo.  I know his biggest concern was not having one of his operations just down the street.  I guess It's like sending your first born to college.  You know it's the right thing to do, but it hurts inside that you can't be close to your baby.    Thank you Lou's.  We're thrilled you came to the Valley of the Sun.",

    "text": "Out of all of the reviews I have done this one has challenged me the most.   Pros:   the pizza. Duh. I actually like the thin better and the GF is tasty also!  They nail cheese big time. This means amazing cheese sticks, yummy curds and again, pizza. Probably the best cheese I have had in a moz stick or pizza.  The Salads do look amazing but I have not tried one yet ....  Cons:  Theare terrible with chicken anything. I know it's a pizza joint but I've tried the sandwich, might be the worst one I have ever had. I've had chicken pasta, like the sandwich the chicken was SO dry and I tried the wings tonight- soggy   Also the service is super inconsistent also. I asked for a to go cup of water (I work next door) was told only employees could have to go cups. I'm here ordering almost 3-4 times a week, I work next door... really?   When I call in an order half the time they are way off on when it will be ready. I get it is not an easy task but usually off by 10-15 minutes   The menu says for the buffalo wings you can select two sauces. When I ordered them tonight, she insisted it is just one. Weird. I even showed her and she said it doesn't imply that ... see picture attached \"chicken wings...comes with your choice of two varieties\" then lists the 3 flavors ... smh   Update: so being so close for work I have ate there maybe a dozen times since this last review. It's definitely a much better experience. I think the best thing on the menu is the bow tie pasta (add mushroom)   If you are going for the first time, I recommend ordering a thin crust personal and thick crust personal both so can try both.",

Anyway moving on to the new restaurant that now sits where many memories were once made....  The atmosphere and energy of the restaurant itself is all good vibes.  Retro feel, a happening scene, lots of smiles and laughter all around you.  We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess who explained how we can pre order our deep dish while waiting to be seated (brilliant).  The wait was only about 15 minutes for a 8pm Friday night dinner.  After being seated our server greeted us, full of energy, smiles, and even a Chicago accent making the experience that much better. He told us about the restaurant's history and shared a few recommendations.    We ordered their signature Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish for 2, the chicken Louie, and the trio dip appetizer.    The Manati Chicago Classic was 5 stars.  Very authentic, full of flavor, the crust was to die for, and yeah - very yummy.  The Chicken Louie.  Oh how this dish disappointed.  We are alfredo pasta snobs.  I love a good dish of alfredo.  The pasta came out in this super cute real bowl and looked heavenly but open shoveling this cheesy goodness into my mouth, disappointment.  Eh, maybe it's just me.  Then my husband had the same look of disappointment.  We both agreed it was bland, tasteless, and honestly not far off from a frozen lean cuisine.    The trio dip I would give 3.5 stars.  The artichoke dip was good but not the best I've had, the garlic dip was over the top, and the hummus, well, was hummus.  I'd skip on this appetizer next time personally.  The manager took off the pasta for us, no issue.   Overall this place is worth the visit, just stick to the pizza.  We will definitely be back and bringing friends.  I've already given a shout out on Facebook and told a few close friends to check it out.  Worth the visit and the prices are reasonable.",

I wanted to wait a while before I tried the new location, let alone write a review. My sister had ordered a deep dish for take out a few months ago. We were pretty disappointed at the cheese to crust ratio and lack of overall flavor. This weekend, we were meeting some friends for pizza and they suggested Lou's. I was willing to give it another shot and I am glad I did! Deep dish was very good. Crust was thinner and flakier. Plenty of gooey cheese and the sausage was awesome!  Now, was this an exact replica of Lou's in Chicago? Nope. However, they are getting much closer than before. I would say they are 75-80%. Will it ever taste as good as ordering in Chicago? May be not, but I am very happy with the progression so far. BTW - we did order a thin crust also, which has never been my go to for Chicago thin, but was a good pizza overall. It is not really a traditional thin Chicago pie (they don't even cut it into squares) yet, with the right combo, it can hit the mark.",

If you go into it knowing you're going to wait awhile, it helps. This is the long, drawn out date night type place. Not the \"omg we have to catch a movie in 40 minutes\" type. You can't rush perfection.",

I think we were greeted by a manager who asked us if this was our first time here. Told us if we needed anything to let her know.  Daniel G. was our server.  He went above and beyond what was required to make our dinner a pleasent experience.  The food was great as usual.  If you are pizza lover you will not be disappointed.  Be sure and try the house specialty Buttercrust.  Pies are made individually and take abit of time, enough to knock back a couple of cool ones or a glass of wine.  Salads are great because dressing is mixed in.  They are huge too.  The resturant is spotless.  I have to drive from North Glendale...hope one of the new locations is near Arrowhead.",

    "text": "I saw this restaurant on the foodnetwork a few yrs back, Best Pizza's .. When my husband a Chicago Guy mentioned that Lou's opened here in the Valley we ventured out to give it a try. The place is tucked away in the back of the AJ's Shopping center, we used our gps to find it. We arrived for a late lunch, Nice decor seats are very comfortable. The server was great very attentive. Having never tried their pizza, we ordered the Classic for two and a Thin Crust w/ Sausage, Mushroom and Onion.  The menu says the Classic is deep dish w/ extra cheese and sausage..   The food arrived and the presentation was disappointing. The \" deep dish \" was in a deep pan, but I wouldnt call it deep dish the pizza barely came to halfway to top of the pan. I think they forgot to drain the tomato's from the can because the topping was a watery mess, the sausage was bland. The best part was the cheese. I do not know what the hype is about this pizza. When I lived in Chicago, I ate Gino's, and Nancy's this place does not come close in the deep dish department.   If you like Chicago thin crust pizza, this place is not for you. The pizza crust was bland no flavor, three was little or no sauce, again the sausage was bland no flavor so the mushrooms over powered the pizza, very sparse with the Cheese. Not a fan. If you want thin crust Chicago Pizza Vito's in Mesa is the best we have found.  After lunch we were not offered dessert, and handed the check. I asked about the key lime pie and I am glad we ordered that. The key lime pie was EXCELLENT ! I would return just for the dessert, for Pizza we will stick with Vito's for thin crust and Gino's for deep dish.   Sadly I wanted to love this place.. food network has let me down again.",

From the Lou to a Chicago Classic, even a standard pepperoni, the deep dish is always so delicious. I recommend Lou's to everyone.",

Then waited at the table another hour to finally get the pizzas. After all the wait, sadly, it was mediocre at best. The ingredients or dough taste like they may be frozen. Taste is poor due to bland sauce and seasoning. The crust was not crispy or airy, but more of a cracker-like texture. Immediately after I left the restaurant, I felt nausea and upset stomach. I'm from Arizona and have had far better deep dish pizzas in Arizona. It is hugely hyped being a big name restaurant from Chicago. The only positive thing I can say is that the design and atmosphere of the place is nice.",
