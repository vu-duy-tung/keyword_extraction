    "text": "I actually went here over a month ago but felt it worthy of saving for my 200th review.  If it wasn't for Yelp I this is one of the places I have eaten I never would have known about.  And it is sort of fun to tell your date your are going to eat in a mostly vacated strip mall just off the highway. :-)  I had been here previously for a Yelp event.  We arrived around 6 on a Saturday just as it was getting dark.  We got seated right away.  Even at that early hour the place was far from empty.  It seldom happens we are amongst the youngest folks in any venue so we happily take note.  As the evening went on the crowd got younger and the place was almost packed.  We got our waters and menus right away and then we sort of got forgotten for about 5 minutes or so before our waiter introduced himself and took our drink orders.  That would prove to be the only glitch in food or service the entire meal.  I had the PCG pasta and she had a black and blue burger.  I also had a salad with Blue cheese dressing.  Lately we seem to have been on a run of less than stellar blue cheese, both my dressing and the crumbles on her burger were good.  We both enjoyed our meal.  Usually we try some of each others food but I declined to take a bite of a well done burger, however she thought it was great.  I did sample the fries and they were pretty good.  The beer selection had a couple of selections I liked to choose from.  Excellent place for a nice dinner out.  Even if you get in to steaks the place is not over the top expensive.  It was quiet enough we no trouble talking.",

They even chopped it for me to make it easier to eat.  The pork tenderloin was so tender and moist. I\"m not a huge fan of this dish in general, but they made me a fan.  They keep things interesting by having specials daily.  The servers seemed very novice. They did not remember drink orders, I found it unusual they would walk away then come right back and ask again what we said.  Went on a Monday Night at 730pm. It was definitely still active at that time. I imagine weekends must be crazy.  The food and atmosphere was excellent, I was a little disappointed in the service. Otherwise would have given 4 stars.",

This house is a delicious hangout that has become a haven for those looking to escape a typical, nightly scene.

Machaca beef stuffed green chili, Menonita cheese, Diegos red chili sauce, salsa fresca, pickeled red onions on a warm small tortilla. $6. Signature bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija cheese and served with chipotle lime aioli lime $6.  From the bar, Markwest Pinot Nior $8.

A pile (big on the quantity) of BBQ short rib meat (shredded) over lettuce and some sad salsa.    It was not very tasty. My guests had a salad and a special burger.  I've never seen this guy dismiss a good looking entree until today.  His  face on first bite said it all.  I thought it was undercooked---no, he said it was just strange.  He only ate half. The highlight of his plate was the cup if green chili which was also a special.    Atmosphere was good Waitstaff was friendly Parking a little limited Outside seating and nice inside bar Selection of wine and specials  Large menu includes some texmex looking items, American and some pasta.  Several salads, interesting salads  Gluten free options Veggie plate is an entree I wish I would have tried.",

Coming off a few less than stellar recent brunch attempts at other local spots (why is it so hard to find good Eggs Benedict!?), I took this to be a less than favorable sign about the meal ahead...    Well, I was wrong...  PCG served some of my favorite things!  A mimosa with fresh-squeezed OJ started things off nicely.   :)   On to an appetizer - yes, even brunch deserves an appetizer!  I was happy to see Jumbo Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp on the menu.  Now that Wildfish no longer serves them, I have been hunting for a new favorite.  These were delicious - 4 large shrimp, stuffed with cojita cheese and wrapped in bacon - perfect with the accompanying chipotle-lime aioli.  And last, the main event.  The Tenderloin Eggs Benedict was fantastic.  Two English muffins graced with generous slices of medium-rare tenderloin, poached (not overdone - hooray!) eggs and tangy hollandaise.  This masterpiece came with diced breakfast potatoes (not greasy at all!) and a small bowl of fresh fruit.  Yum!    Thank you, PCG, for renewing my faith in brunch.",

The part that really put me off was the mashed potatoes.  There is only ONE option and that is Horseradish mashed potatoes.  I was hesitant because I just don't do horseradish in anything.  It was not horrible but come on, Horseradish mashed potatoes?  Garlic or plain, Yes.  I'm surprised there is not at least one other option for mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, that is enough to keep me from coming back because I love mashed potatoes but not Horseradish!!!",

We arrived about 12:30 and were seated immediately. Judging by the parking lot I was prepared for a wait. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We ordered drinks and the hummus plate to start. All good. I had the 16th St. Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Fries. I ordered my burger cooked to medium and that's exactly how it arrived. A nice surprise. My companion ordered the Phoenix Cheese Steak Sandwich which he loved. For a side he ordered the Horseradish Mashed Potatoes. I got a taste and they were awesome. We didn't have room for dessert. I'd highly recommend PCG. We'll definitely be back.",

Really great atmosphere - much larger on the inside than you would expect from looking at the outside.  Rebekka was our server and she was fantastic.  I ordered a side salad (not listed on the menu but they were happy to prepare) and asked for a dinner roll.  The roll was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside and served hot with butter on the side - the roll was delicious!  In fact - so good that I ended up asking for and eating two more :)  I selected the Smoked Pork Shoulder ($22.00) and my dinner companion selected the Bowl of Chili & Cornbread ($12.00).  For dessert, we shared an order of the Bread Pudding ($8.00).  All items had a great presentation and all were very, very delicious!  The portions were generous.

Our server was actually the bartender and he was impressive, very quick and knowledgeable.  I had a late lunch so I wasn't looking for a large meal so I ordered the soup and salad combination.  The chicken tortilla soup here is to die for!  My friend loved it so much she actually ordered a second helping.  My boyfriend had the ribs and said they were amazing.

I am usually the one who wants to make changes and substitutions and she said that they were no problem. And they weren't - my food came out just right. I had the short ribs and added cornbread instead of one of the sides. The cornbread was great - it was moist and just the right amount of sweet, and it was served still a bit warm. And the short ribs were wonderful with a rich wine sauce. My husband had the special of pork that was sliced and served on mashed cauliflower with some other sides. He could not say enough good things about his meal.",

As always the food is fantastic, the service is stellar and the atmosphere is perfect to enjoy a meal.   Today Karla was our waitress and she was so friendly and helpful.  Part of the charm and atmosphere of Phoenix City Grill is everyone that works there.  Karla did a fantastic job.  She made the meal just that much better.  Thank you Karla!!!!  Cowboy steak was the choice this time, but really, that is the choice most every visit.  I have tried many of the other entrees and they are very good, but there is just something about the Cowboy Steak on a bed of chili...  Not the chili your mom made, just better!!!  If you want a steak this meal will definitely become one of your favorites.  I try to go to PCG every time I am in Phoenix.  If I lived there it would be more often.    This time they gave us the Chocolate Tort and well it was beyond what I would expect for a dessert.  The Tort was very light, but add the vanilla ice cream and strawberry puree..it was pretty fantastic.    I promise you if you go you will not be disappointed.  I can say I have never had a bad meal or lousy service in the dining room.",

Our food is always the perfect temperature, the best ingredients and very nicely presented every time!  Last week we were in for lunch and decided upon the burger of the day.  It was wood grilled chuck with memonita cheese, tomatillo salsa, cornmeal crusted jalapenos, arugula and local tomatoes on a toasted talera roll.  I could not resist, what creativity in putting together the ingredients.  OMG it was the best burger I ever had and I eat more of them than I should!  It was very juicy, all the ingredients blended perfectly, not over kill, and all on a wonderful warm toasty roll.  This is why I keep coming back.  The wait-staff was friendly and attentive as usual.",

    "text": "Highs: Consistently good specials, fair prices, brief but nice wine list, dim lighting, nice ambiance  Lows: Parking, spotty service   PCG is a neighborhood fave, with lots of locals who keep the place relatively busy. Reservations required for peak times. The staff is always friendly if occasionally slower that I like, which is probably a good thing if you are there on a date. And it is a great place for a date, with low lighting and upscale, cherry-wood decor.  The food, however, is what keeps the clientele coming back for more. The menu is a solid collection of steak and seafood standards, with some unique alterations to keep things interesting. Most have a southwestern flair. Cedar-plank salmon is a personal favorite. Pay close attention to the specials, though; uncommon combinations of ingredients often generate the same response, \"Wow, that sounds great!\"  Additional amenities include a very nice bar, with a couple of TVs, as well as a private dining room for large parties.",

    "text": "Since my review of TexAz, I thought it would be good to review PCG kiddycorner to TexAz.    Picture a Strip mall....you walk in....lights turned low, red walls, dark carpet...intimate...perfect...you've forgotten about the strip mall.    The restaurant was one of the first restaurants that I tried when I moved to AZ in 1998.  Thank you to my Aunt Marge for taking me to this little gem.  The food is what I like to call great american cuisine elevated.  PCG can, in my book call itself the most dependable dinner in the valley.  I have frequented this establishment many of times and have never had to complain about a single thing in the restaurant.....maybe when they closed for that short time back in 2000 I bitched a little.    When a restaurant puts Mac N' Cheese on a menu...they are dying to be critiqued hard...So I use Mac N' Cheese as a measure of quality.  Mac N' Cheese is such a bad name because Kraft and Velveeta have raped it of legitamacy in the culinary world.  Now PCG makes a darn creamy rich flavorful Mac N' Cheese and that to me signifies attention to quality.  I have had bad MNC at other \"deconstructed\" restaurants but PCG doesn't stray to far from the point of the dish...and they are successful.   I also fancy the Pot Roast or the Pork Tenderloin.  To start I seem to always get the black bean soup and always happy I did.  Great place!!  Will always be included as my diamond in the rough restaurant.",

The portions were good for all to share, and as the restaurant mentions on their website, the prices are reasonable.

    "text": "I really enjoy PCG, mostly because it IS a neighborhood restaurant.  It's predictable and simple.  It's reasonably priced and far better than standard.    Things I adore are: Griddled corn cakes with black beans and grilled chicken, so good and less than $10. The carnitas taco app is wonderful and SO much food.  It's too much for me to eat at dinner and it's about eight bucks! The pot roast sounds simple, and it is, but dang, it's so yummy.  Super tender meat and homemade mashed potatoes with just the right about of gravy and topped with fried parsnips.  You can't go wrong.  I'm very disappointed that two things I loved on the menu are gone.  First, is the ahi salad, it was really good.  When I inquired, I was told that with the rising costs of ahi that it wasn't a cost effective option.  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the blackened chicken sandwich.  I craved it.  Blackened chicken with applewood smoked bacon, jack cheese on a grilled bun.  They changed.  Dammit!  Why?  I'm holding a little grudge on that one.  At lunch, I always get the soup and salad.  Soups are good, particularly the yellow split pea and I love the honey ginger salad dressing.  The bar is good for happy hour and relaxing after a movie or a night out.",

We usually eat early, before church, but this year  made reservation at 8:30pm, after the service.  When we arrived, the place was packed.  Even with reservation it took an hour to get seated but we knew it was due to the holiday.  The manager comp'd us free appetizers due to the delay.  We ordered crab cake & skewers(chicken and beef) and they were good, with the hint of Thai accent.  For the entrees my husband order a pasta and seafood dish which he liked.  His brother had a delicious pork chop.  I ordered pasta and jumbo shrimp on the side but the server forgot to add the shrimp, which delayed things even further.  Phoenix City Grill is one of our favorites but this time they were too busy to provide prompt seating and service we expect.  We only visit once a year.  Maybe next time will be better.",

Good location, a little dark while reading the menu. But we were happy with the options, nice for those who wanted a good steak or entree, or for those who want something on the cheaper side of the menu.   The waitress Kathryn was friendly and quick though she had a lot of tables. Water was prompt and drinks and wine served within a few minutes of order. We ordered the Goat Cheese toast points and it took a while to get to the table, but they were worth it. Really Yummy.   My friends ordered the Phoenix Cheese Steak and the Black and Bleu Burger. Both looked really good, and they received good feedback. I ordered the Rose something Chicken and it was really good with the tarragon au jus. The best though was the Pork Tenderloin, super yummy and totally worth the price. It was really flavorful with the jalapeno jelly they basted it with, and the meat had a really smoky flavor to the meat. The quinoa cakes were really tasty for quinoa. We decided to do dessert and the buttermilk pie was amazing. I'm from the South and this was the real deal. The Bread pudding was really good as was the Chocolate torte.   Overall very happy with this restaurant. We will definitely be coming back. Especially for Happy Hour, close to if not half price appetizers till 6 drink specials. Great bar and lounge atmosphere.",

Normally, I recommend dropping them off at Outback on the way to your dinner reservations, but I think I found a place to take them!  I haven't been here before because it is a bit out of my normal daily range, and its not in a place where you would find it unless you know where to go.  But I have heard about this place from downtown types who swear by it.  Stacy the Complainer and I had the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer.  She had the griddle corn cakes, and I had the beef tenderloin.  The surroundings are very nice, but comfortable.  Service is attentive and friendly, if not always fast.  Plan to take your time, you can't rush a good experience.  The wine list was short, but good - not pretentious at all.  Anyway, not much of a peep out of STC, because she was busy with her plate for quite a while.  She still took a good bit home for later.  I'm almost always good for a steak, and the tenderloin was exceptional.  It is served with sauteed mushrooms and a twice-baked potato.  Good spud!  Would have been fine with a couple of those.  And there was really nothing for STC to say about the check, either (even though she has never been known to willingly pick one up).  Actually, I was surprised at the prices, given the atmosphere, which would suggest a pricier total.    Overall, I'd say its definitely worth a try, even if you aren't a downtown person - worth the trip!",

We had the seabass($24) special and pork tenderloin($21). Absolutely phenomenal dishes. Ordered a side of fingerling potatoes ($5) and those were very dry/overcooked and came out so late. Our bar tender picked up the tab on those. Free dessert we had the torte ($8) and weren't disappointed. Total bill with one mixed drink was $68. Worth every penny. It seems dark and uppity at first but the music sounds like it's one of the kitchen staff's ipod, which we found amazing and definitely offset the first glance of high class diners.",

    "text": "Yesterday was our first visit and both my wife and I said \"What took us so long to find this gem!\" As is typical for us, we most often visit the bar on a first visit. We tend to get a great feel from a place through the bartender/server. This was no exception. Max was our server and he was outstanding! He was professional, attentive and pointed out the must haves on the menu. Wife and I are light eaters, but we want to make sure we get a good representation of the chops in the kitchen and Max was correct. We started off with the Eggplant bites. Fried eggplant with goat cheese, sweet pepper, Arugula, a tomato jam and a drizzle of balsamic. Yum! We then had the bacon wrapped shrimp. What can I add to this? We split the kale and Brussel sprout salad and added a salmon skewer. The salad was terrific, but the salmon added a nice touch. It was wonderfully marinated in herbs and lemon. For dessert, we had the coconut panna cotta. Light and creamy! The best part was the caramelized pineapple and 2 huge blackberries. The also have a terrific wine list and on this visit we chose the unoaked Chardonnay from Hess. Fantastic. We had such a great time and guarantee you will too. Cannot wait to come back.",

Our server Sean took excellent care of our 12 guests, even going above and beyond by helping cut the huge, gorgeous cake Sassi Cakes made for our graduate and taking a lot of group photos. He was pleasant, attentive, but never intrusive. Food and drink quality was excellent, and the pacing was perfect.

I recommend the cheeseburgers and margaritas. They are very tasty and pair nicely. The atmosphere is very comfortable, dark and cozy. This is a local spot, and neighbors use it as an excuse not to make dinner at home. Give PCG a try, and it will likely be in your standard rotation, and you won't be disappointed.  The only area I think PCG could improve is with desserts. As good as the meals are, the desserts just aren't as good or enticing- which is not to say they are bad, just not on par with the rest of the place.",

The place looks real nice but that fly on my pepper shaker drew my attention. 2.  bartender service was good, could have been better if they hadn't been so busy with chores like getting ice, and cleaning.  There were 5 other workers at the entrance standing around talking and doing nothing. 3.  Food here was $8 for a chicken enchilada which was the best I ever had, and the $4 grilled veggie which was OK I guess. 4.  For some reason, happy hours that are on the weekend attracts the old geezers out of their retirement home and there were plenty with blue hair and men wearing shorts with sandals/long white socks.  PLEASE!  Too bad this place doesn't have a reverse later happy hour when real live people come out. 5. If you don't want to drive way over to Snotts-dale to eat, the area north of Camelback and Central  has some good places to eat thanks to  the million dollar homes around here.  This place is worth a visit.  I am going back for another enchilada............",

My friends had the breakfast enchiladas and the beef medallion eggs Benedict. Everything was very tasty! The price point is great too. Most of the dishes were $10.    Here's a tip: the tomatillo salsa served on the enchiladas has small bits of bacon in it. One friend is allergic to pork, and couldn't finish the dish once she discovered it.   This is a place with good food AND great service! I dine at PCG maybe every other month, but for some reason, I went a few times in a few weeks recently.

PCG burger: the the fried jalapenos were made with fresh jalapenoes and since we didn't feel like getting a side of fries, we got a cup of chili for a dollar extra. Overall a large and good burger.  Griddle corn cakes: this reminded me of a tamale without the corn husk. This was probably the best thing we had. This consists of two corn bread-like pancakes that sandwich chicken and cheese, topped with pico de gallo and a side of beans. Together, its a great and delicious combo.

Very inviting bar area. Next time I go back I want to eat and drink there. Service was pretty awesome, eggplant app was crazy good, and great location to bar hop after a nice dinner. Food was presented well, portion size was ideal, and place was clean. I liked the hints of Phoenix/Desert decor mixed in with some modern items.",

    "text": "Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back.   I started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started.   For my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!  I wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience.   When I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!",

I've met friends here for civilized drinks (i.e. wear something other than jeans and a T-Shirt and not having ten drinks and getting smashed) and for dinner. What I like most about this place is the atmosphere and the service. One thing I dislike about Phoenix is that EVERYWHERE is casual. When I come here I like to dress a little nicer and like sitting at the bar having a glass of wine or a nice cocktail rather than slumming it elsewhere over a Miller Lite.  The food is good, not great. I am always bothered by a restaurant whose Surf and Turf is a New York Steak and Shrimp......in my opinion, the \"Surf\" should always be lobster. Not a deal breaker but that is one offering on the menu that bothered me. The best part of this place is the bar, and you should definitely check it out.",

I enjoyed their pot roast, which was very tender and covered in a delicious bourbon gravy. The horseradish mashed potatoes were good, and not overpowering. My wife had the PCG Pasta, which she felt was good but could have been a bit more flavorful. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed the carne asada tacos from the small plates menu. My 8-year-old thought the brioche roll on his hamburger was too crusty, but I took a bite and have to say I disagree. The burger was tender and nicely done, and the bread was just fine.  We also appreciated that they not only have many wines available by the glass, but a broad selection of scotch and bourbon as well, and I happily ordered a glass of Bakers with my meal!",

Due to this, every time I decide to treat them to a meal, I really have to put a ton of thought into it.  I've struck out many times, but hit one out of the field with Phoenix City Grille.  Goat cheese toasts started the show.  The cheese was delicious, with the sun dried tomatoes really giving some depth  Entrees ordered were the pot roast, pasta and an amazing porkchop special.  The pot roast was exactly what I craved, dare I say needed.  It took all the self control I could muster to save some for leftovers (Pot roast sandwich the next day, of course).  The chop was devoured in a frenzy by my normally mellow dad, while my mom eagerly sopped up the pasta sauce.  I still tend to over think meal planning with the family, thankfully Phoenix City Grille has given me a solid option.",

The ribs had a nice BBQ with a spice to the dry rub flavor. wine selection was from 7 daughters wine up to some wines from Paso Robles. The ambiance was dim lighting for mood setting. Wood floors, booths or tables. Smaller intimate restaurant, it's tucked in towards the side of the strip mall. You will only see it if you're looking for it or driving up northeast side. I would go back, our waitress was super sweet. Some of the best service I've received for a whole in a restaurant. You can see she is used to her regulars that all knew her well by name, yet with us she also welcomed us in and made us feel as if we could be regulars. She was very friendly and helpful with our menu selections. We would return here in the future.",

But the greens were fresh, the chicken grilled to perfection, and best of all, the salad wasn't swimming in dressing.  We split a piece of the peach cobbler cheesecake.

Although the restaurant was busy we were treated as if we were the only ones there. The atmosphere was very accommodating as it was warm, friendly and fun. The Aromas coming from the kitchen we're very enticing. The food looked fantastic. And tasted even better. I asked our server Rhyne if he would mind surprising my girlfriend with the Dozen Roses I bought for her. Rhyne was more than accommodating and brought the roses with her drink as requested. He went above and beyond by putting the roses in a ice bucket and filling it with cold water. Well beyond what we had expected. The portions were just right the taste of our dishes were fantastic and we made reservations to return this coming Saturday with two other couples. Rhyne expressed his pride with his employment at PCG and stated his employer Sheldon the owner works right alongside the crew. Every staff member we saw was smiling yet very busy attending to everyone's requests. You could tell it was a family type atmosphere with all the employees involved. We look forward to our next dinner this Saturday night and we'll be doing a Sunday brunch in the very near future. Thanks again Rhyne for the excellent service. We'll see you Saturday. Tim and Suzanne",

It was so dead inside. It was just my boyfriend and I in the  restaurant. My boyfriend joked around and said that he made reservations just for us to dine in the restaurant.. ahha. No. Lolz.  My entree was the crispy eggplant Burger and fries. The fries were so crispy hot and fresh. My boyfriend devoured it.  My burger..... Ehhhh. I don't how I feel about it. I didn't taste the eggplant at all. I taste more of the bread crumbs and the bun than the eggplant. There was also a slice of a thick tomato. I can also taste the tomato, bun and the bread crumbs .. that's it.. there was no spice or flavor to it.   From the outside, you would never know its so spacious and elegant inside. I love the wine bottle area, of course I had to take a picture in front of it. *smiley face*",

    "text": "So, my fellow yelpers who love happy hours...I have discovered a new happy hour destination! Phoenix City Grill, which sports happy hour from 3pm-close. Yes, til close!!! Sweet baby Jesus, finally someone answered my wishes!   First off, the decor was lovely, as was the ambiance. Happy hour is only available in the bar area, where I quickly ventured to. Some of the happy hour items are: Beef sliders with yummy Tillamook cheese (whaddup Oregon!!!), grilled fish tacos, hummus, Green chile cheese dip, beef and chicken skewers, etc. All in all, a great selection with wonderful execution.   The liquor selection is also solid. Any bar that has items, such as Plum Vodka, gets a thumbs up in my book. The wine selection is also good.   PCG is right off the 51 and also closely located to my dive (yes, my personal dive) the Swizzle.   My only gripe: The bar area was serviced by one waiter - the bartender. So, being that he was making drinks for the restaurant side as well as serving the bar area, the service suffered. He was not nice, inattentive, and at times rude.   I was able to ignore him as the food made its way to my belly.",

I will return for sure. Its nice inside. The lighting is a little on the dark side which is good with me. The bar is nice but wish there was more seating. I had the pomegranate margarita and oh yeah it was so good. I only had one cause they were $9 then I just went with water. But the cool thing is they have PBR for $2, got to love that and happy hour form 3-close. Yeah I'll be there. The happy hour menu looks great and cant wait to try it out.   So on to the food. I had the Surf N Turf Pasta. Its is Grilled beef tenderloin medallion and jumbo Sea of Cortez shrimp over fettuccine tossed with tomatoes, mushrooms and sweet corn in a green chile butter sauce. It was delicious. The beef was cooked a perfect med rare and the wood grill flavor really came thru. The shrimp were great wish there was more shrimp. I did get the small portion so more shrimp with the large . Small was $14 large is $18. My friend ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin which is Wood grilled 8oz. center cut filet with chipotle cheddar stuffed potato and sherry glazed mushrooms. $27 These mushrooms were like candy they should serve them for an app cause I know I'd get them. I wanted to get dessert but I had a long night ahead of me so I will have to get something next time. I did see a few desserts come out and looked great. Overall the place is great and I have a feeling I will become a regular. The server we had was the nicest guy. He was very knowledgeable of all the menu items and answered all my questions without hesitation. Great food, great service, and good ambiance. I cant wait to try the happy hour menu.",

Ribs were mouthwatering, fall off the bone, marinated fresh each morning and not overcoated, perfect. Really didn't even need the sauce they had such flavor already.  Black bean soup was nice and the chopped salad was real good too with a nice peanut dressing. Nice wine list with plenty of affordable by-the-glass options. And the server we had was nice too, my companion and I stumbled in after a hike to Piestewa Peak and were definitely underdressed, but everyone was nice about it and they clearly wanted out business and valued us as customers.  If I lived in this area of Phoenix, this would be in my rotation for sure.",

I had the crusted fish and it was fantastic! The menu had many different price options and that was nice too because sometimes you just want a burger! I think another reason why we will come back is because I saw many gluten free items on the menu. We have a son with Celiac so finding a safe place to feed him is priceless!

I think the bartender was new, not just because of the deer in the headlights look on his face, but also the fact that I had to wave him down after about 7 minutes of sitting there. There were 6 specials, 2 which caught my eye. After settling on one, we ordered and were told they were out of 4 of the 6 specials. Might I add it was about 12:15pm. That seemed a little early to be running out of specials. The food we ordered ended up to be OK.   If you haven't eaten here, you must. If given the option I would pick 3.5 stars. This is because of the service and the lack of available specials (maybe cross them off the sandwich board out front when you run out?) I've heard they have a great happy hour and I would definitely recommend the bacon-wrapped shrimp on the app menu.",

I was a little disappointed to find the price is now $24. I doubt I will reorder at that price.  They were just not that outstanding.",

    "text": "I am stunned to find a poor review of this place.   I discovered this place after I started my current job; the office is down the street and for the last 5 years I've eaten here at least 100 times.    The location is downright bad, there is literally nothing around it that invites you to stop in.  They've been doing a lot of work on the complex lately, adding outdoor seating and it seems to be coming along nicely.  I love a place with a good surprise and when you open the door, a warm, inviting place greets you from a strip-mall parking lot.    The decor is like a Houston's meets southwest.  It's a great place for business lunches, ask for a table in the back near the mirror or a booth.  The bar is also a great gathering spot for coworkers, clients or friends.  It's classy and there's variety for everyone.  I love bringing out-of-towners here for a neighborhood culinary treat with a southwestern flair.    The staff is friendly, genuine, always helpful and appreciative of your business.  I can honestly say in 5 years I have never had bad service.   The wine list has enough variety to not be overwhelming, beers on draft feature some local and microbrew varieties, martinis are perfectly crafted and not over-shaken.   The food- oh the delicious food.  I love that the chef tries to use as much local, fresh ingredients as possible.  He is consistently featured as a supporter of local farmers.    I think it's a summer special but lately Monday's have been happy hour til close with $3-$6 full-size apps and $5 glasses of wine- seriously there is not a better deal in town with this quality of food.    Bacon wrapped shrimp:  these little suckers are rich but delicious.  They are filled with some sort of southwestern cheese and served with a creamy sauce and cabbage slaw.  Mix them all together in one bite and the smoky bacon, plump shrimp, creamy cheese, cilantro cream dip and cold, crisp cabbage are a treat for your mouth.   They are pretty decadent so be prepared.   Griddled Corncakes: Holy heaven on a plate.  Imagine moist, tasty cornbread, only flattened out like a pancake.  Then, stack them with deliciously smoked pork and mexican cheese (not too much) and place them on a bed of black beans.  This is the dark horse of the menu.  They can easily be a meal and for $5 at happy hour one helluva deal.  It becomes a little tricky to share with more than 2 or 3 but worth every bite.  Queso Fundido: light, creamy, consistency without gross chunks or a heavy oily topping like other places; just a nice mixture with just the right kick.  Chips are thin, crispy and always fresh and hot.    Goat Cheese Crostinis: eh. these are ok but I think time and money are better spent on other items.   Fish Tacos:  THE BEST IN TOWN.  First, they actually cook the tortilla- novel concept.  Second, it's a perfect portion of moist, grilled, flavorful fish.  Third, topped with loads of fresh toppings- pickled red onions, shredded cabbage, delicious sauce, fresh house made salsa....for $5 and you get two??? I'm so hooked.  Spinach salad: fresh and always delicious.  I recognize a lot of the ingredients from farmers market and love it. I take any opportunity to consume the homemade couscous.  Bethany Chopped: I order it with the peanut and sesame dressing on the side.  The shaved chicken, crispy tortilla strips all mixed in are superb.   CHILI: I anxiously await the first cold, chilling day of the winter where nothing sets you straight like a good bowl of chili.  Holy hell this is amazing.  Lots of smoked pork, just the right amount of beans, a spice that keeps you coming for more and to boot, a pickled relish and slice of cornbread to accompany it.   Black bean soup/ Tomato basil soup/ Daily (Thu?) green chili:  always tasty, comforting, nice layers of flavor and great texture.  CHEESEBURGER:  I don't know how this one escaped Seftel's list...seriously.  It's rich, delicious and downright divine.  Order it as is and you won't be sorry- cooked medium it's the best I've ever had.  The french fries are thin and crispy but still filled with soft, tender potato.   Chicken sandwich: always moist, large, clean cut grilled breast, great toppings.  Coleslaw: fresh, nice balance of zing and creamy but not too much.    Daily Catch: This is what I typically get because I like to experience whatever the chef has for the day.  I always go crazy for the couscous and have honestly never been disappointed with the daily catch- sometimes it's a bit adventurous but I always welcome it.    Cowboy Steak: If I ever want to bribe my husband into ANYTHING, I dangle the Cowboy Steak in front of him.  I'm not kidding, it's better than anything I could offer.  Full-flavored ribeye on a bed of that pork/bean/chili tastiness + jalapeno relish = OMG",

    "text": "3.5 stars. Decent upscale American restaurant catering to older steak/seafood eaters.  I went there for a work dinner with 10 people and was pretty excited at first with its slick interior design and good looking menu, but was consistently let down throughout the evening.  I got my first warning sign as I started looking around looking at the clientle. It looked someone started handing out 50 dollar gift certificates for PCG at Luby's the night before. With a crowd that old and tame, I knew the food wouldn't have as much flavor as I look for.  Next, my pomegranate margarita arrived which tasted likely what pomegranate kool-aid would taste like if they made such a thing. I'm not sure if it even had alcohol in it. I switched to their draft beers which are from several small breweries and much more worth your time.  Next came my Ahi Tuna special which was definitely not worth the price tag. Very bland. Didn't seem like they should even be serving it if they don't know how to make it interesting. Although the rice side dish that came with it was great. Other's in my group who had steak, salmon, and such were much more pleased.  I gave them a chance to redeem themselves with their Croissant Bread Pudding which sounded phenomenal, especially to a bread pudding man like myself. Again it was fairly par for the course and not worth its price tag. The bread pudding at Sonora Brew house is worlds better for less money.  It seems like a great place to take your parents or people who like meat without much spice and drinks without much alcohol, but it's definitely not a place for me.",

    "text": "Beware of the high cost of corn bread.  My husband and I have been to Phoenix City Grille twice before.  It's really great.  They have a wonderful happy hour and we went for brunch on Easter of last year when our first place brought out a plate of food that had gum on the plate.  (Rule #1 - Never put your gum on the plate.  It doesn't wash off or scrape off that easily. You are a lowly human being if you put your gum on your plate or linen napkin.  Use a disposable napkin or tissue.  Karma will pay back the people who leave gum on plates.)    Our first two trip to Phoenix City Grille were great.  Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonably priced, and truly great happy hour.  This past visit left a lot to be desired.  Our server was friendly enough, (I believe her name was Sonya).  We ordered our drinks which she brought out quickly.  We ordered our food, and then waited.  The table next to us that was sat after us got there food first.  Not that big of a deal.  Then we asked for some cornbread.  Both times we were there before it was brought out to the table just a few pieces for my husband and I to enjoy.  We thought it was odd we had to ask for it.  She offered us individual pieces, or a skillet.  We asked or a skillet.  At no point did she mention that a skillet of corn bread was $10.  It wasn't until we got the bill and had to track down a manager that we learned if you order (yes order) the corn bread in individual pieces, then it is free.  However they charge for a skillet. I don't recall seeing anything on the menu that said cornbread in a skillet - $10.  The manager was gracious enough to reverse this over sight, but we did not see our server again for the rest of the time we were at Phoenix City Grille.  Another server, not even the manager who resolved our cornbread issue brought us our check, ran the card, and returned the check for us to sign.   Things happen.  Sonya didn't mention the up charge for whatever reason, we disagreed that we had never had that happen before, and the she vanished.  I was a server for years.  People don't always agree with how a business is run, and it's the job of the front line (the servers and front of the house staff) to inform guest of what things cost wither by having a price on a menu, or by telling them up front.  I'm disappointed that the felt she had to run away from us. We'll go back, but now we know, beware of the cornbread up charge.",

They are like pancakes, but with some veggies between them, kind of like an omelette... and then there's some pico de gallo thrown in (that was good) and served with syrup. Just my personal preference, I guess, all of those flavors didn't blend well for my taste. However, the bloody Mary was tasty and at $4 is a steal on a Sunday morning! My companions had the crab cake benedict and the bread pudding french toast (more like a dessert than a breakfast), both were excellent.",

    "text": "I finally get back to town after my month-long trip and head out to eat, only to be underwhelmed by a restaurant that everyone on this site loves.  Day two back from vacation: I've gotta make up the debacle from the night before to the hubby.  So, despite an inch of rain falling during the time it took us to drive from Van Buren to Bethany Home, we decided to keep going up to the Phoenix City Grille.  And I'm so glad we did.  I had been here a few times, thanks to the corporate overlords of the funeral home I worked at just up the street.  But, at the time I was a vegetarian and not astounded by the menu (embalming and meat eating just don't mix in my eyes).  Thankfully, I gave up my veggie tendencies, because the food here is incredibly delicious.  The husband loved his burger sans bun and claims that it was the best burger ever.  SCORE!    Oh yeah, and my meal was phenomenal too.  Super juicy pan-fried chicken and horseradish mashed potatoes.  The horseradish had no kick to it, but the flavor was definitely there.  I suppose if I could offer advice to the awesome chefs at PCG, I would suggest adding a splash of horseradish on top.  But I really love that sinus-clearing sensation of good, fresh horseradish.  Regardless, the meal was fantabulous.  The service was wonderful and the atmosphere is calm and cozy.  The menu is a smidge pricey, I won't be making a habit out of PCG, but it will be one of my reward restaurants.",

The eggplant is definitely crisp, not soggy, and the accompanying goat cheese is just the right amount of creamy, rich texture and flavor without weighing the sandwich down. The sweet potato fries are also seasoned perfectly.  The chipotle BBQ burger is really good. The onion rings on the burger are fantastic, but the overall burger is a little too salty for my personal taste. Still, it was very nice, and the french fries are good.  Service was pretty good. We had a nice time and I think we'll definitely be back.",

The bacon wrapped shrimp is good, but after two, you feel a little weighed down. It had some type of white cheese in it- not necessary. I shouldn't have tried it anyway- I am trying to be a fishetarian. They have great simple salads. And the cedar plank salmon is absolutely my favorite menu item. mmmmm.....",

Oh, wine you say?  Well here you go - a comfortable little bar area (yes, cocktails too) in which to chill out at day's end and catch the ball game of the day or vent about work.

After scowling at us for bringing it up, the new bartender from Flagstaff poured out the wine and then informed us that these were tiny strands of cheese from our con queso, which my girlfrind didn't touch and was about 2 feet away from her. It is obvious when you have hairs in your drink! In attentive service from that point on, but when we left after awarding the bartender the 5% tip (more than he deserved) he pursued us down the sidewalk to the south, outside the building by walking along the plate glass windows on the inside, banging on them alongside as we walked.  What a weird experience! Been going here for years and years, some of their dishes are quite good, others not so hot; wine list pretty indifferent and slipping. But this kind of behavior is a game changer. I will never go back.",

I had a seasonal salad with local grown varietal tomatoes, roasted beets (a weakness of mine), and Queen Creek olive oil which is usually spectacular, but this time was sort of ordinary. I opted for the beef  fillet add-onto protest against vegetarianism. It was medium rare, tender, and very good. The salad had some lump of bread but I didn't eat it. My friends had the portobello burger and the black bean soup and both were very happy. I will be back next week for another lunch and will write a follow up.",

Every meal I have here is better than the last, it's ALWAYS consistent, and the menu has something for everyone.  My personal faves are the black bean soup and the Bethany Home Chopped salad (and I'm not really a salad kind of gal :)!!!).  But don't shy away from the ribs, OMG is all I can say, or the PCG pasta.  Come to think of it, any PCG virgin I've taken here has raved about it and become a novice themselves :)! Add in the full bar and great wine list, this place is a MUST for a constantly consistent great meal! In regards to the attire i chose dressy because if you came on a weekend night in jeans and flip flops you may feel under dressed, but you could absolutely go jeans and flops during the day for lunch (as I did today)! Happy eating!",

I had the Bethany Hope salad, less the tortilla strips. I thought it was really delicious. I had enough of a craving for that salad to want to come back within the week. Never made it however. It was about 115 degrees, hot outside and the salad was refreshing and different. Everyone else loved what they had. chef salad and a sandwhich. They had specials, but they were no longer available in the kitchen - ran out of ingredients - due to high demand. Again, the place is quite popular. Overall, very satisfied with my visit, though the service we recieved was less than polite. She showed up to take orders and only appeared with the drinks, food, and the bill. The place has a real easy-going vibe, un-pretentious and inviting. Not your Red Robbins but not as high maintenance as City Hall in Scottsdale.",

Our hunger couldn't wait til nighttime, so we hit it up for a late lunch. Holy YUM!  Bacon-wrapped shrimp: giant shrimp stuffed with cotija and crispity delicious bacon. A heart-stopper, for sure, but damn, sooo good. We then split a blue-cheese wedge salad and a green chile burger, and both were perfectly put together, fresh and delicious.  Green chiles could have had more heat to them, but that burger was cooked perfectly, not too greasy, juicy bites on a nice firm roll that held up all the way through. And great pickles, too.  Would have liked a nice IPA offered on draft, as opposed to the bottle option, but other than that, we really dug it. FABULOUS service by Karla, who left us alone just enough, but was always ready to freshen up our waters or make sure we were enjoying our food.",

In the almost 4 years I've been here I've tried Phoenix City Grille for happy hour 3 times.  They have a nice red wine selection and the Martinis are pretty good, especially for $6 bucks.  The prices are really good for happy hour ranging from $4 - $6.  In the three times I've been to PCG I've tried the Sriracha Honey Glazed Short Ribs, Bacon wrapped shrimp, Soy Ginger Glazed Beef & Chicken Skewers and Sweet Potato Fries.  I'm only a fan of the Sweet Potato Fries and Short Ribs to be honest.  Both the bacon wrapped shrimp and the skewers were way too salty to me.  The last time I had the skewers I couldn't get through my order.  I will say, every time I've been to PCG it was a pretty packed house.  Not crowded but pretty packed. The one time I had dinner at PCG I ordered the short ribs.  They are SUPER good.  Just not as good as mine which is why I've only had them one time ... I think mine are better   For those looking for HH place sin Central Phoenix this place has Happy Hour from 3pm to close every Monday and Tuesday.  Wednesday through Sundays, HH is from 3 - 6pm.",

    "text": "This has been on my try list for quite some time, but there are SO many restaurants in the valley that it took me forever to get over to Phoenix City Grille. So now comes the True question-how on earth have I lived in Phoenix for 2 years and just now had the chance to dine at this establishment?  What was I thinking waiting so long?!! This place is fantastic!  I've had several misses at restaurants where I feel something was lacking, be it service, flavor, value...not here.  We enjoyed an exceptional evening out at the Phoenix City Grille.  Started with drinks and my glass of wine was a very generous pour (this mama was happy-I like my vino).  We also had the Griddled Corn Cakes and the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp as appetizers.  They were absolutely delicious.   For entrees our table had a variety of steaks-all cooked perfectly.  I personally had the Eggplant Sandwich.  OMG.  There are no words to describe the sandwich, but I will say it is probably in my top 20 best things I've ever eaten.  I told the server 'if I were a sandwich this would be me'.  The flavors were out of this world.   Too stuffed to try dessert but I know 100% I will be returning soon.  Our service was fantastic as well.  Our party of 6 were all extremely pleased!",

I decided to bring friends with me on the next visit and we were rushed to the point where it was extremely obvious. Our server made us fill as though we were a nuisance. Through it all we still left her a 20% tip. I chucked it up to them being really busy, server having a bad day, etc. The third visit I went with some friends and they wanted to put our table of 5 in the back corner room closed off from the rest of the restaurant. We requested a table in the dining area like everyone else. It took a few minutes for the hostess to discuss it with either who I think was the server or manager. I just told her nevermind on the table and we went across to The Vig. At that point I just gave up on PCG.",

    "text": "One star for service. 4 for food. I didn't want to write this review. But I'm finding myself still fuming about it. I went to dinner with my young son a few nights ago. We don't go out to dinner often because I work in the industry at a local restaurant and I work nights. I'm also a single mom who goes to school almost full time. I chose this place because I live near by and I've heard great things about the food.   We arrived around 6:30 and things did not look too busy. Ten or so tables inside and one on the patio. No one was at the host stand and it took several minutes for someone to finally come. I asked for us to be seated on the patio and was told to have a seat and the hostess would follow me with menus. We found a table and after a solid two minutes no one brought menus. I finally got up and got them myself. After that it took over five minutes before the server came to the table. No smile. And very little eye contact. Quickly took our drink order and returned with drinks fairly promptly. The server then took our order without a smile, suggestions, or personality. I asked if they had a kids burger( I'm not complaining that they didn't) and the server said \"you want cheese on it?\" No yes or no. Just asked about cheese. I don't know if they were in a hurry or what. The food came and it was really delicious. The server came to check on us and said \"good stuff guys?\" As they were walking away. At the end of meal the server never asked if we wanted dessert and took my payment. Then returned it with a very quick \"goodnight\". Never took my empty plate and I had to move it to sign my credit card slip. The service was an epic fail from start to finish. NEVER SMILED. I'm pretty easy to please honestly. I will probably be back for the food, but not for awhile. And if that same server is anywhere in sight, I will specifically ask not to be seated in their section. It's unfortunate that the service alone ruined a rare night out for my son and I.",

    "text": "Not too impressed.  I'll start with the good.  The restaurant had a very good vibe.  I had several conversations with interesting and intelligent people in the bar.  However none of those were people that worked there.  First it took precisely 8 minutes and 38 seconds for someone to ask me if I would like a drink.  And that is when things took a turn for the worse.  I said yes I would like a San Tan Brewery IPA, a Hop Shock.  The waiter was down right rude in his response, we don't serve that.  I was very surprised since I had been to the phoenix city grille's website prior to my visit and THE reason I decided to go there was because the phoenix city gille's website said that they served San Tan Brewery beer.  When I informed the waiter of this he became down right rude to me.  \"Well you must have been looking at an old menu online\" he barked.  Wow, I was looking at what phoenix city grille had on their website, if that was wrong it was not my fault.  I ordered another beer and moved on.  At that point the rude waiter disappeared... as in I never saw him again.  After 30 more minutes another waiter came by and asked if I would like to order food.  Yes, I have been waiting to order your carne asada street tacos I responded.    When the tacos came out the presentation was very good.  Two tacos, a red and a green sauce and a cabbage/tomato garnish.  The green sauce was very good, I believe it was a tomatillo based sauce which is not something I find everyday.  The red sauce was very bland and lacked flavor.  As for the tacos, I was hoping for a little more flavor in the the meat.  It was dry and only medium flavorful.  And then I hit a huge chunk of gristle and had to spite it out.  At that moment the second waiter came back to ask if I wanted to order another beer.  Having had enough of the crappy 4 peaks brewery offering for an IPA, I said yes I'll have a glass of your house Zinfandel.   The waiter then went over to the bar, pulled out a bottle of 7 deadly Zins and poured the remaining half glass.  He then shuffled and shuffled around and came out with a different Zinfandel label and poured the other half glass.  The wine was fine but I've never seen a waiter pour half a glass of one label and half a glass of another label.  Moving my focus back to the tacos, I then I hit it.  A large shard of bone in my second taco.  At that point, interesting conversations aside, I just wanted to get out of there.  As I walked out I noticed that the restaurant that had been packed during happy hour was 3/4 empty for dinner service.  The staff was too busy and too rude to serve me during happy hour and then at 8pm there was no one there wanting their crappy service.",

Well.... their definition of well drink is a little different than most places, for example, they do not offer a well margarita.....pretty odd. The bartender was terse and I did not care for him. Anyway, as my family arrived we decided to sit down. We had made a reservation through open table and they accommodated our party of 12, so that is a positive. The food was good, not amazing, but solid. My family is big into sharing so I got to try the beef tenderloin (good and came with a tasty chipotle potato), the chicken special (chicken with green chile and really good goat cheese polenta), the pork tenderloin (this was maybe the best thing, it had a really flavorful sauce and horseradish mashed potatoes), and the ribs (flavorful, but a little drier than I prefer). We also split Caesar salads which were tasty, they had very well seasoned croutons. The service was good considering our large party size and it was an enjoyable place to have a large party.   I kind of think of it in terms of a wedding....a lot of wedding food isn't amazing but it works because it works for big groups....I think this place is like that. I probably wouldn't go here for a date, but I would come here with a big group again.",

I was a little apprehensive at first, but once we stepped inside the atmosphere was good overall. It has subdued lighting and music played in the background but never too loud.   The food portions were good and the pot roast I tried was decent. Also worth mentioning is the bread pudding which seems to be a favourite. It was a decent meal, definitely wouldn't call it outstanding.   One good thing about this food was that it was well priced - that's always useful.",

The 4 of us enjoyed: black bean soup, black and bleu burger, ribs, salads, and meat skewer appetizers. As first time guests, we were offered a free dessert- we happily chose the chocolate torte with vanilla gelato.  Food was great, service was friendly and competent, and the place was pretty much full by the time we left @ 6:45 pm on a Thursday (we stopped in for an early bite after a Spring Training game nearby).

    "text": "I just have to add that the owners here really know the definition of good customer service. A month ago, I took out-of-town guests for Sunday brunch. Part of the reason I chose City Grille was because they had a promotion where you could get a free appetizer for checking in on a Smart phone. All you had to do was show your server. Well, my server, no matter how nicely I approached the matter, kept insisting that deal was only for people who brought a print-out of an email--even after I showed her on my phone what their own restaurant's Facebook page stated! She just shrugged and said \"Well nobody explained it to me.\" I don't fault her if nobody told her. But I do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like, \"I don't know anything about that but let me go check with a manager\" after I showed proof. It wasn't even the appetizer but the principle of the matter.  I left a comment on the restaurant's Facebook page--very diplomatic, not with any self-entitled overtones. Their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened. Less than two days later, he wrote me, with the owner copied in, apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two!   This update is not to say \"Woohoo! I got a free meal.\" It's just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it. It also sounds like because of me, they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that. And when I did go back for my free meal, that same server was there, lol. Luckily I had another server who was a lot warmer and approachable.",

The pasta was not drowning in sauce, so the flavors of the vegetables served with the pasta really added to the dish. The chicken was delightful..savory and juicy.  My friend ordered the short rib which was just incredible. The Cabernet-smoked bacon sauce really seals the deal on this dish!   I'll be back..",

    "text": "Phoenix City Grille knocked my socks off with some special treats they dazzled us with at a CMYE (Community Manager Yelp Event) and I recently returned with the generous buy-one-get-one voucher they sent us home with (it expires on the 30th, fellow Yelpers who haven't redeemed theirs yet).   After the delicious scallops at our Yelp event, you can guess what I had my heart set on -- hopeful that there would be a special, since they are not a regular menu offering.   Fortunately for me, there was a short rib and scallop special. It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event.   Trying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor.   My \"plain\" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious!   So, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options!   My friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I've had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit.   I had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you've ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing.   Another tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip! I liked it so much, I called Total Wine to see about buying a bottle for home and searched the vineyard's website for where to buy a bottle in Arizona but didn't get very far. I guess I'll have to add that to the reasons to return to Phoenix City Grille!",

    "text": "Great place for a work lunch! There weren't a ton of vegetarian options but the ones I tried (appetizer and entree) were both excellent and I'd happily eat again. Like many other Yelpers recommend, the crispy eggplant appetizer is really really good. Perfect balance of textures and a really great combination of flavors. I also had the season vegetable plate which contained a variety of roasted vegetables like cauliflower, carrot, and potatoe served with a lemony aioli which was perfect and spring-like. On another visit I got the crispy eggplant sandwich, which is like the appetizer but super sized and served between two delicious brioche buns. Both entrees are fantastic! Service was great and the space is nicely lit with a lot of natural light. It's just a little bit on the pricey side.",

    "text": "Finally went here after attending the CMYE and had a great meal! PCG is a very classy little restaurant that is low-lit and practically perfect for dinner, vino and conversation. The staff is very professional and helpful, and it was undoubtedly a pleasure to be served by them.  The food was good, though a bit steep in the pricing department. I tried their famous corn cakes, and I also got to try the 16th Street Pot Roast and Rose Lane Chicken. The corn cake was the highlight of the meal for me. Imagine the flavor of corn bread (that's not dry, mind you) accompanied with chicken, salsa, black beans, and topped with some jack cheese. Mmm! Every flavor really complimented each other really well. That appetizer was what a fancy southwestern appetizer should be like. The pot roast was also delicious, and I would say the same about the chicken. The meat in both dishes was cooked just right, flaky and tender for the roast, and perfectly juicy (not wet, but not dry) for the chicken. Both entrees were very comfort food-ish.  I hope to eat at PCG again sometime soon. The food and service were great and it definitely has a great ambiance about it.",

Now that's what I call good service and concern for he customer and doing it right. I said wow..it is my birthday (which it was) so that was a pleasant surprise. She also offered free dessert but we were full and thought that would be greedy.  So will still have a positive view of this foodery and will continue to go back....their standards are high.",

    "text": "My bf and I headed here last Friday night after we decided some normal, comfort food was in order after scoping out a few other trendy places downtown on Yelp.  While I typically don't like restaurants located in a strip mall, this location didn't seem to 'mallish' and there was ample parking. We arrived around 8:30pm and the place seemed pretty busy with an older crowd. I think we were probably the youngest people in there. Old people know where good food is :) The patio seating might get a bit old with people walking in-between tables so we opted for something inside.  The atmosphere was dark but yet inviting. We were greeted by a smiling hostest and seated as soon as we walked in. Our waitress came around quickly and gave us water and we had just the right amount of time to decide we would try the Crispy Eggplant bites for an appetizer and Baby Back ribs for me with a twice baked potato rather than fries and my bf's Grilled Pork Tenderloin.   Having never had fried eggplant I envisioned almost chip like wedges of eggplant but these were more like patties. And OMG were they good! There were only 3 and we definitely fought over the last one and savored every bite!  I'm not usually a girl who orders ribs but these were definitely good. The sauce was unique, a little smokey but not too much but they had really good flavor. The coleslaw was really good, reminded me of KFC with a small punch of ginger and the twice baked potato put a smile on my face. Totally not on the diet but I didn't care. My bf was really happy with his pork tenderloin and the small piece I had was really good. He continued to comment throughout the meal how good it was so I know he liked it a lot.  To further ruin my diet, we ordered the warm chocolate torte. It was good but one of those really strong, flour-less bunt cakes and they usually aren't my favorite.  Overall, between the atmosphere, food and service, this is definitely a place we will come back to!",

    "text": "I've driven by this place so many times over the last (almost) 20 years, and finally decided to check it out. The atmosphere is very inviting, with a warm, casual, neighborhood vibe. The service was wonderful, especially our server, Rhyne. We started out with the green chile pork appetizer to share, and both agreed it was tremendous. Apparently it's only been on the menu for a few months. It's a real winner, and was nicely plated, too. The flour tortillas, fresh and thick with a little char, were stars in and of themselves. For our main entrees, my boyfriend had the 5 chile spiced chicken breast sandwich with the \"simple\" side salad and sherry vinaigrette. Simple it was not; it featured a lovely array of ingredients on mixed greens. Most restaurants consider a side salad an afterthought and don't put much effort into it. Not Phoenix City Grille! Even the dressing was outstanding. He thoroughly enjoyed his sandwich too, remarking that it was expertly seasoned. I ordered the salmon skewers appetizer as my entree, and they came with a nice arugula salad with roasted beets. The salmon was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the salad complemented the salmon beautifully. For dessert, we shared the pumpkin cheesecake - it's Fall, after all! - and it was a lovely ending to a truly enjoyable dining experience.  Phoenix is really becoming a dining destination, with trendy new (and increasingly pricy) restaurants popping up all over the place. Phoenix City Grille offers fresh, tasty, and interesting food at a very reasonable price, and without pretensions by either staff or clientele.",

The Rose Lane Chicken makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Bread Pudding is divine, and they get mucho brownie points for not putting raisins in it!!

Sweet and tart, but not too much of either, this drink is awesome!  Many awesome things on the menu, great daily specials, & you can really taste the love and local difference in all of their menu items.

    "text": "Had dinner here yesterday (a Sunday) for my 31st birthday.  Spoke with Sheldon beforehand to reserve the private dining room for \"20-25\" people.  After some hesitation on his part, he agreed to not requiring a set menu, and I agreed that my party would be patient with the service (which did not end up being a problem at all).  He also did not require a deposit, which was fantastic.  I got there later than I wanted to, as I wanted to arrive a little before my reservation, but I got there exactly at 7:00 p.m.  After saying hello to some friends who had already arrived and were waiting in the bar, our table in the private dining room was ready after just a few moments.  We went in and began sitting down - the private dining room is off to the side of the restaurant (beyond the bar area) and was great for our party of 20.  There is a men's and women's restroom at the end of the dining room which was great as well, and the tables were organized well enough that it felt like we were eating at a single grand dining table.  Service was very good, especially considering the amount of people we had and that they were willing to do separate checks.  After getting our drinks ordered and delivered (which took about half an hour), we ordered.   For appetizers, the table had the hummus, but a few others ordered the green chile queso (very unique and good), the fried eggplant bites (I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I'm not a big fan, but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish, which was good), and the bacon-wrapped shrimp (YUM).  All of it was good.  Personally, I also had a cup of the black bean soup (very good, especially if you cannot get enough black beans like myself).  My entree was the surf n' turf pasta, which was really flavorful.  You get two shrimps, which were decent sized, and two medallions of beef, which were cooked well but not overdone.  The fettucine was not al dente but still had a good texture, and the sauce was not buttery/overwhelming.  Everything felt/tasted complimentary, which was a good thing!  We finished things off with their version of chocolate cake, and they had a pumpkin cheesecake which was interesting, but I would have preferred regular cheesecake.    Anyways, I wanted to thank the staff here for a great birthday dinner.  Everything tasted great, the service was good and prompt (I don't believe there was a single issue, which is amazing considering they had 20 people all ordering something totally different, without a set menu), and we all had a great time.  We got started a little after 7:00, and we were done a little before 9:40 (from what I can remember).  For 20 people all ordering drinks and food, that was some efficient service!  I would definitely recommend PCG for a big dining party.  They were courteous, professional, and accomodating.  Fantastic place with very good food!  Thanks!",

    "text": "Easily one of my favorite 3-course meals that I have had in Arizona. We started off with the Eggplant Bites which were creamy, crunchy, sweet, bitter, and just absolutely delectable. I followed it up with the Cedar Plank Salmon which is literally served on a plank of cedar (duh), and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Normally too much horseradish (part of the puree on the salmon) can overpower a dish, but PCG had that seasoning on fleek. Lastly, came the Warm Chocolate Torte; goodness gracious what a topper to a meal!   The service was also fantastic! We were seated right away and the server was very knowledgeable about the menu. I look forward to trying more items on the menu next time we visit!",

I was looking for somewhere in central Phoenix with a family vibe and a private room - Phoenix City Grille offered all of those things!  We fed 80 people across two nights and all of it was able to be planned from San Francisco. Shout out to Brittnee for going above and beyond.  The staff were courteous, quick, attentive, and very receptive to my asks  when I wanted to make changes to the menu or the format for each 'round' of guests. Not only that, but they didn't seem overwhelmed at all, even when we had a LOT of earlybirds show up and wait around.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would, if/when we come back to Phoenix I know where we'll go!",

We wanted family we brought in to try it because its always been a favorite. Now not so much.  The changes do not go together.  Appreciate trying to be more modern, but in this case , it doesn't work. If you have good things going for as long as you have been in business , and doing very well... leave good things alone! Try totally different things , but leave long running items the way they are good and done well for years.  Came to find out the ribs have changed on the appetizer menu, which was fine, but then the cornbread is gone! There are even pictures o here of it that people are reviewing  the ribs..

This place is truly exceptional. You can order an appetizer if you are not hungry. They have sandwiches, salads, pasta, the best burger ever along with steaks and ribs. I have had almost everything on the menu and I love it all. If you love brunch, they have one to order off the menu on Saturday and Sunday. SOOOO good. The servers are all the best and the owner is always there, I think that is the reason for the success. They take reservations and can handle large groups. I drive from Scottsdale it is that good.

I had the shrimp appetizer & brussel sprouts, Bebe had the root vegetable plate & skewer of salmon. Sweetie ordered the green chili burger & tortilla soup. The food was very good, at one point we were all too busy eating to talk. But to be honest, the stuffed Shrimp was overcooked, it was still good but it wasn't great. The bacon wrap was a bit too chewy. The burger was dry too. Even with the green chili the meat was just too dry. But the good news the other items were spot on. The Brussel sprouts were so delicious with pancetta, marcona almonds, parsnip & leek puree a with basil chimchurri!! The root vegetables, salmon skewer & tortilla soup were great too! We didn't have room for dessert but they sounded good. We'll be back!",

It's a pretty dark restaurant to be careful when you take the two steps up to the dining area.   Service is very good and place is very clean.  I ordered the following: Roasted Beet Salad ($10): it had mixed greens, candied pecans, orange segments, goat cheese, roasted beets, apples and sherry vinaigrette.  It was very good, very light and flavorful and the dressing was perfect.  Dreamy Draw Chili ($6): I love chili and unfortunately I'm not a fan of this one.  It was too thick so I didn't really enjoy it.  This is the perfect place for a business meeting, next time when I'm in Phoenix and need to schedule lunch with a colleague, I will definitely go here.",

No fee for the projector or screen - private bathrooms- personal server and top notch food.  They made us a personalized limited menu but they will also offer full.

Everyone at the table was pleased with their food - scallops, pork shoulder, burger, pasta with chicken and cream sauce. Desserts were all tasty and big enough to share.

We had the Griddle cakes and the spicy Hummus appetizers ! Hamburgers: the blue cheese and the PCG burger were delicious. The beef was excellent and the sauce was great! The pot Roast with bourbon gravy was excellent. The portions were big and could easily be shared by two. The Rib eye steak was large and very delicious. We also liked the flavorful mashed potatoes.  Service was very good! I will be back soon !",

We sat for almost 10 minute at bar before we were asked if we'd like a drink. The Green Chile Queso Fundido was quite tasty. We intended to order a few other items but We had to pry the bartenders to return for refills and food that we decided to leave and continue Happy Hour elsewhere. Keep you posted on our return to PCG...",

We were warmly greeted and seated, and within minutes our server was taking our drink orders. PCG has a lovely wine list and beer menu with a few tasty cocktails as well. For an appetizer we had the recommended corn cakes with chicken, queso, and beans - superb... a hint of sweet and savory. Four different diners - four different dinners between us and each one tastier than the first. Black and blu burger with bacon on a soft burger bun was good (but a bit dry.) The chicken special was fresh and light and flavorful. The Idaho trout was delicate and perfectly complemented the roasted cauliflower and asparagus. And the pork chop was a huge mass of yum! We shared the bread pudding which was probably one of the best I've ever had. This place does get crowded and I would definitely recommend a reservation.  YUM.",

I started off with the Maple Glazed Candied Bacon cinnamon roll. A very tasty treat. It's a must try and must share. I'm so glad I shared with everybody because I wouldn't have been able to have my everso tasty Seafood Sandwich. Talk about YUM! Shrimp and Crab with scrambled eggs, asparagus and hollandaise sauce. They were light on the sauce which I really appreciated.   When we first pull up, from the looks of the outside and the name Grille, I thought I was overdressed. Walking in told me I was glad I dressed a little nicer than I normally would. The inside and atmosphere was perfect for a Sunday afternoon brunch with the girls.  I have to end with our waitress, Natalie, again. Awesome! I asked her to choose a dessert for me because I couldn't decide. She brought back the luscious Croissant Bread Pudding. Buttery and carmely. Rich and another one to share! She was right on with that one!  Definitely give this place a try!",

Their menu is terrific and has a number of great options although I find myself often ordering the Griddled Corn cakes (with bacon) for brunch or the 16th St beef short rib.      While I have never used them it appears they have some private space for larger group gatherings and the bar area is great and has a few TV's.    The service is always adequate to great and it is nice to have a restaurant that tends to have a relaxed atmosphere and is generally on the quieter side.  This is generally one of the restaurants I will take friends and family to when they are visiting as it tends to please a broad range of personalities and palettes.",

    "text": "Went there the other night for dinner.    I had the special of the evening, seafood linguine with shrimp and crab and lemon capers butter sauce, .   WOW!!   It was great.  In fact, beyond great.    I was trying to figure out how the pasta was flavored with every bite I put in my mouth.  I think I shall call the restaurant and find out.    It was the right mix of ingredients, not too buttery, which would make it oily/greasy.   The right amount of capers, which, if there's too many, overpowers the other flavors, and the right mix of barely knowing it also contained lemon.     Oh, yes, he had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin.    Since he is on a \"low carb\" diet, he asked to exchange the starch for veggies.    I was thinking about having that, but I am more of a seafood, chicken gal versus beef.    I tried it.   It was good, the beef was very tender.    Sorry, can't give a review from  just one bite.   My wine was the cab, Sebastiani, Sonoma Black Cherry.    No, I don't follow the white with the seafood/chicken \"rule.\"     I like cabs.    It was good.    I shall go back, you can count on it.    I sure would like to have the flavoring mix of the pasta.   I had called the restaurant to find out the name of my dish since it was the special of the night.    I was told it used to be on the menu, and they try to mix it up.    My opinion?     I think it should go back on the menu.    It was delish!!",

But we went in last night and WOW - AMAZEBALLS!  Was really good, ambience is great, staff top notch and attentive - just the way I like it.  We started with the eggplant arugula and goat cheese appetizer. Sounds disgusting, I know, but WOW - delicious.  Also had the steak tacos, which were really good with two different sauces to choose from.  Add a glass of the house Syrah and wowza!~  We also got the Cowboy steak (mostly to take home for steak tacos in the morning) and another home run.  At the end of the day, we looked at each other and said \"WHY DON WE COME HERE MORE OFTEN\".  So, with that being said, we are going to be there more often.  This place is right up there with Hillstone for me (which as some of you might know), is my #1 Arizona hangout.  One recommendation would be to beef up you Pinot selection.  That seemed to be lacking, and didn't love the ones that were available after sampling those.  Go there are try this place, I don't think you will regret it.  Tell them Attorney Steve sent you!

Have had better, have had worse.  I had the full slab of baby back ribs.  To fit on the plate they had cut the full slab into two.  Hmmm, I think one of the pieces was from an older, drier slab they were just trying to get rid of.  Not cool.  One half was juicy, succulent and perfect, the other was dry and almost inedible.  My wife had the cedar plank salmon.  Had some kind of weird mustard crust on top.  I didn't like it at all.  She found it mediocre.  It is a cute, comfy, local place with a laid back vibe.  I can certainly see us going back there again.",

I ordered the Green Chili Burger (green chili, jack cheese, pickled onions), I ordered the burger med rare and it was waaaay over cooked as there was no pink at all (and I didn't have time to have them cook another one as I was on my lunch hour)...The cheese wasn't even melted causing everything to slide off the burger. The green chili wasn't cooked enough as well. The bread was good but everything in-between wasn't. I had the cole slaw as my side and that was good but nothing that left an impression on me. The other business associates I was with had the Pork special, PCG pasta and the chicken sandwich. All of theirs looked good and I definitely had plate envy. I know for sure if I do go back I will not be ordering the burger but would try something different.   Service was great though!",

    "text": "We found Phoenix City Grille about 3 years ago when we were looking for a restaurant centrally located to hold a small party after son's wedding for a group of about 20 people. Phoenix City Grille (PCG) was very accommodating with us on short notice to have a table of that size and got out the food in a timely manner for us. We have visited there several times since then and have never been disappointed in the food or service. First time writing a review of our experience Saturday night, 6/8/19.   We made reservations through Open Table for 6:30 and got there around 6:20. We were promptly taken to our table and within minutes, Tara, our server, greeted us saying water was on the way and took our drink order. We got a bottle of Seven Daughters Red Blend wine, the first time we had tried that wine, but not the last time. It was good!  Tara returned shortly after with our wine, which was a twist open top, which she commented she had heard from others in the wine industry that wines without a cork often are better preserved than those with a cork. She was proficient in serving our wine and taking our order.  I got the Baja Shrimp and added a Cesar salad. Hubby got the beef tenderloin cooked medium and also added a Cesar salad. Within minutes of our order, our salads came. Delicious. Unique dressing on a Cesar salad, hubby thought it had a taste of lemon in it, but very delicious. Shortly after, our entrees came out, appealing looking, hot, and very scrumptious. Good size portions.   Tara was attentive in providing for our needs and very personable. We were in the back room with about 6-8 tables in it which about 3/4 of them were filled. It was a little loud but you could still hold a conversation without shouting at someone. Before we left, I went to the restroom which was clean.   We'll be back for sure! Its a favorite restaurant of ours here in the Valley.",

From its excellent bar staff (who make amazing libations) to its Phoenician-centered decor to its super-friendly staff, it has earned its place in the culinary and dining experience lexicon.  Truly excellent food, at truly moderate prices, served in a truly relaxing atmosphere.    I was part of a 35 person dinner reservation for a large party, so wasn't expecting \"great or amazing\", just hoping everything came out hot and/or cold as appropriate.  It did.  Clearly the kitchen has timing down to a science.  All of the meals were very, very good, and all of the diners enjoyed each and every course.  This is NOT easy to do!  I was impressed and will make this a regular stop whenever I am in Phoenix.  My advice - get there 30-45 minutes before dinner.  Relax in the bar - soak in the artwork. Chat with the staff.  Appreciate how far the Phoenix has risen in the last 20 years when it comes to the finer things in life.  And if its summer - well, be grateful for air conditioning!",

Bacon wrapped shrimp was stuffed with Cotija cheese and served with a chipotle aioli and mixed green salad. Four large shrimp on plate. We had a couple of orders of eggplant bites and both apps were very good.  Two people in our party had salads,  two had sandwiches and I had the Fall Winter Roasted Vegetable Plate. I did not hear any complaints. I  am not a vegetarian. I did not have high expectations about  butternut squash with cauliflower and carrots with apples and arugula salad  but was pleasantly surprised. Exceptional taste with a carrot puree and celantro funnel chimichurri sauce. I would order that one again all day long. Service was exceptional, parking was easy. Prices are moderate but excellent quality and presentation. They offer smaller plates as an option for one or sharables.",

Whenever we meet for dinner, they never want us to come out there. They want to come to the Phoenix City Grill. The Phoenix City Grill is our favorite restaurant.

While parking looks limited right in front of the restaurant, there is parking in the rear, so I had no trouble at all on a Sunday evening.  Our reservation was for 6:30 Sunday night and we were seated immediately at a booth when we arrived.  We were pretty hungry when we arrived so it did not take long for us to order our food. I ordered the steakhouse burger (without mushrooms) and my boyfriend ordered the Madison stir fry. I absolutely loved my burger. First of all, it was enormous and served with a good amount of thin-cut crispy fries. The burger was so flavorful. The patty was cooked to perfection (medium with a pink center). The caramelized onions added a nice sweetness, the cheese was gooey, and the house made steak sauce made the burger. In addition, the burger was served on brioche bread, which is my favorite bread for burger buns. The brioche was so soft and delicious, but the one con of brioche is how easily it falls apart. My one complaint about the dish was that the fries were not seasoned. The stir fry was also really delicious! The sriracha-citrus glaze was really unique and had just the right amount of kick. The coconut rice and quinoa pilaf meshed well with the stir fry and every flavor paired well. My boyfriend and I will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes!!",

The bar area has bar and small high table seating.  Adjacent to the bar is a group room.   I was shocked to see 2 different Pappy VanWinkle products on the shelf (10/12 year for 30/40 a pour).   Very nice bourbon selection although I didn't partake.   Lunch was corn cake appetizer and a side of potatoes for me.  My wife had the soup and salad combo.   The corn cakes were sweet and slightly fried but turned soft quickly with pico on top.  I don't see how this is easily shareable but it was delicious.  Only change I would suggest is to move diced jalapenos into the batter.   The potatoes seemed roasted then fried and were super crunchy.   I really enjoyed them as something different than standard fries.   My wife's soup and salad were very large for a lunch portion.  A largo bowl of pinto bean chili and a Caesar salad with heirloom tomatoes for a different twist.  My wife commented that the dressing was creamy and the perfect Caesar flavor.    We washed it down with some standard wine and beer.    After we left we recommended the restaurant 3 more times in two days.  It left a great impression.   Well done PCG team!",

Plus the waiter assumed we were done with the appetizers and cleared them before.    It almost felt as though they were trying to get us out as fast as possible.    The food itself was good.  The vegetable platter was good and I would order it again.  I didn't get to finish all of the vegetables because the waiter scooped it up before we were done.   I ordered the beet salad with salmon as an entree.  The beet salad was good but the salmon skewer was smaller than I hoped.

The fact that the parking lot was full was a good sign. It has a sort of old world ambiance inside. We split the hummus appetizer and it was SOO good! I have no idea what special ingredients they add to make their hummus, but it worked for us. It came served with a sliced pita plus veggies and drizzled with balsamic. Yum. Then came the best of all - my salad. I had the Ramona Farms Super Food Salad and it was absolutely the best I've ever had. The roasted squash was perfection. It was served with a chiltepin-dijon vinaigrette. This may mislead some, as the dressing was actually not too spicy at all and had a touch of sweetness to it. Simply divine! The grainy goodness and fruits were layered over arugula. I live in Goodyear and I swear I'm going to drive all the way back there again just for that salad! The service was top notch and not at all pretentious. The waiter gave us a great shopping tip to visit around the corner in the Melrose neighborhood. Just a wonderful experience - highly recommend!",

I told the waitress that we're waiting for one more person and waitress told me she'll come back once she arrives. The waitress sure came back quickly once she sat down!  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin - the pot roast is the most popular dish though if anyone was curious (because we inquired about it). I've slowly learned if you're in doubt about what to order you should ask what's the most popular dish and decide if it's right for you. I think pot roast can be easily made in a crock pot with Pepsi and some seasoning for the juiciness and flavor so I was ehhhh....  My pork tenderloin came with small cut pieces, mashed potatoes and vegetables. The best thing on my plate? The vegetables - they were cut small and the mixed of the vegetables were really tasty and delicious! The mashed potatoes were very buttery and the pork tenderloin was just okay - it didn't melt in my mouth and I wasn't drooling after eating it - am I suppose to? The sauce on the plate was sweet and soury and it went well with the pork tenderloin but I felt like it was overpriced.   But the rectangular plates make it seem like the food is better - it's just a deceit. I think the decor makes the food ttaste better than it really is because I think it's just simple food plated nicely (so they can charge you more).  Would I go back? Probably not.... maybe for happy hour because it seems reasonable and plus I LOVE happy hour food - I don't know why I would complain about cheap good appetizers? Well, I only complain if it's not that  great or I take a bite and I wonder why I paid for it.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my meal and experience at PCG.  My dinner date and I shared the chicken Enchilada appetizer, PCG pasta (small portion), and the Jack Daniels bread pudding desert.  The Enchilada appetizer was good, but unfortunately was served at room temperature and was not hot enough.  Since we ordered the appetizer, we went with the small portion of the pasta, and I wish I had chosen the large size because the small portion was as the menu said: small.  There's just no way of knowing portion size.  The PCG pasta was very good and I would order the large size.  The small size is more for elderly people.  Our server listened to our request to put the sun-dried tomatoes on the side and she provided great service.  A different employee who seated us was high on drugs or something because he wanted us to know \"how happy he was feeling.\"  And with his facial expression and demeanor, you could see he was happy in an unusual way.  This didn't bother us as he wasn't our server.  The bread pudding desert definitely made this review go from 3 to 4 stars.  Not only was it very tasty, the portion size was huge, so that made up for the small pasta!  We were definitely wowed by this desert.  We will definitely come back.",

Our reservations were for 7pm, but they were that packed that we didn't get seated until around 7:30. It's a cozy lil place and when we finally did get seated we sat in the \"governor's corner.\"  They had a lot of drink specials which I would have loved to try, but I was feeling under the weather. I ended up ordering the Cedar Planked Salmon. I made my husband get the special for the night,  ribeye surf and turf (basically shrimp, sausage and scallops on a stick as the surf part). My salmon was a slightly over cooked and I wasn't a fan of the horseradish potatoes, but I ended up trading the potatoes with my husband's potatoes which were so much better. =) He seemed like he enjoyed his meal and he ended up eating the rest of mine too. (That's what husband's are good for ;)) In any case, I loved the atmosphere and the company. We ended up getting two free desserts with the kitchen being backed up and the wait for the table. We ended up with the croissant bread pudding and the warm chocolate torte. Both were delicious, but the warm chocolate torte was my favorite.   Overall, service was good especially for a busy night and food was decent. I would definitely want to come back to try some drink specials and more desserts. =)",

    "text": "I went to the Phoenix City Grille with my parents last week after going to the Arizona Tourism Show at the Convention Center downtown. My parents just moved back to Scottsdale after living in Houston for 2 years, and on our way home we realized we were starving, so my mom remembered the PCG and suggested we try it again after at least 5 years not having been there. It's a little off the beaten path (although easily accessible from the 51), but I have to say that it was one of the best meals we'd had out in AGES!!!! I live downtown Chicago, where the culinary/dining scene is truly one of the best in the US, and the quality and presentation of the food here really impressed me. Just a fantastic place.  My mom and I decided to try a bunch of appetizers, and my dad had the pork tenderloin.  We had the fish tacos, the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the griddled corn cakes, and the crab cakes.  I cannot tell you how fantastic each and every one of these appetizers was!!! The fish tacos were the best we'd EVER had--and we're a major fish taco-eating family! Fresh grilled fish with a chipotle-lime aioli and pickled red onions--just fantastic. The bacon-wrapped shrimp were HUGE! I don't know where they get these shrimp, but they're incredible, and stuffed with cotija cheese. Yes, a little rich, but absolutely delicious.  The griddled corn cakes--incredible! They totally balance that sweet-salty thing that everyone loves, and the corn cakes were soft, fluffy, and surprisingly very light.  Then the crabcakes. We're originally from Maryland so we're VERY picky about our crabcakes--and we were shocked to discover they actually did them correctly!! Fresh, lump crabmeat (not shredded!) and very little filling, served with an incredible lemon aioli sauce and a little salad. Just amazing!  My dad had the pork tenderloin, and he's a bit of a picky eater and left not a single scrap on his plate! I love how the waiter asked him how he wanted it prepared (yes, you can have pork tenderloin done medium), and it was served with jalapeno preserves, these incredible mashed potatoes, and roasted root vegetables. My dad cleaned his entire plate and loved every bite.    On top of it all (yes, we were stuffed!), we decided to split a dessert--the bread pudding, which was absolutely DELICIOUS. Not overly sweet or rich, and nicely presented. Excellent coffee, too.  I was so pleasantly surprised by how great the Phoenix City Grille was that I just HAD to put a review on Yelp (and this is my first!).  Our server was excellent, and I don't have a bad thing to say about this place.  I wish it were in Chicago! We'll be back as soon as possible.  5 stars.",

Our server was adorable, friendly, and on top of everything; however, the food was not nearly as memorable as it was 3 years ago, before we moved away.  I ordered the Rose Lane chicken that I thought was moist, but simply did not think the broth that it was \"swimming in\" was a compliment to the chicken.  Am not sure what seasoning they used, but it was not very good.  We ordered a caesar salad and the dressing was so blah that we ordered some ranch and tried to boost the flavor.  My husband had a wonderful glass of Fess Parker Chard and it was wonderful.  He ordered just the shrimp wrapped in bacon and thought they had been deep fried, vs. sauteed and that they were a bit dry.   We both preferred their old menu rather than the updated version.  Some of the fish items that used to be on the menu are now gone, being replaced with newer versions with odd side dishes that the server explained could be changed for other options, which was nice.  I hope they will bring back some of the oldy but goodies of days gone by!",

All I can tell you is that it was delicious and I was the envy of all the diners at my table.  I could see everyone eyeing my pasta and wishing that they had got what I did.  AND it was pretty big, so I ended up taking half of it home with me. Nice!  For dessert, I had the pumpkin cheesecake, which was amazing.  Really, really good. Definitely give this place a try!",

    "text": "Next to Richardson's, PCG is my favorite American style resto/bar in this sector on the grid.   I refer to this as part of North Central Phoenix, though those sorts of definitions begin to get muddled if you look closely enough. The Phoenix City Grill is a wonderful date restaurant, with excellent service, a classy, upscale decor, great service, superb wine, and fair prices. That combination is hard to come by, in my experience, so I have always been a fan.   The cuisine is new style American, with some Italian and western european influence. I have had a salmon pasta dish there a number of times that I always am happy with, but more than anything I am drawn back by the great wines and desserts.   There are a couple of Chilean wines that I highly recommend, as well as any dessert that they offer.   If you haven't been and you are looking for a nice new spot to take someone, PCG is a great call.",

I had their 16th St short rib stew (and kuddos that you have a small portion option) and it was scrumptious.  I practically licked the plate and you always know its a winner when I don't offer to have anyone taste my dish.

The prices are moderate - some of my friends have suggested prices are on the high side, but great food and drinks with terrific service is not cheap, and I have never had reason to complain. We regularly dine at a number of the restaurants that have opened in the North Central area in the past several years, and while each has unique and positive attributes, PCG has become our benchmark, against which all others are measured.  Well done, Phoenix City Grille!  We will be coming back.",

We had a good conversation with one of the regulars at the bar and got the food. It looked so good, we just pulled into a parking spot and ate it right there.  The corn cakes were delicious.

Cooked to order medallions of beef (I believe its filet) and HUGE prawns over a bed of fettuccine noodles. Seasoned with diced green chilies, corn, and a bit of cheese, it's\"s a bit spicy, but over all just so dang tasty.   I also have recently tried their Dreamy Draw Chili and it is a winner. Made of pinto beans, it's\"s different from your traditional red sauce chili.   I honestly have not had a bad dish at PCG. Kim is the best server they have, but maybe we're biased because we know her. If you still have not tried PCG, make it a point to do so soon. I hear their parking lot remodel is completed. :)",

Read some other reviews that recommended it as a good date spot and I agree. Dim lighting and great service were good starters. My bf got the slider to start then we got skewers to share. They were awesome.  For entrees my bf got the tenderloin and I got the surf and turf pasta. My bf happens to be a foodie who has traveled the world so when he likes a place it is outstanding- and he did! I loved my shrimps as big as a baby's foot and the beef was so tender. It was melt in your mouth good.  To finish I had the bread pudding which we were told were made from croissants that they make onsite fresh everyday. It had a lush sauce that went with it but it wasn't too heavy. Perfect end to a great meal. So glad this is a local place that we can add to out favorites.  As far as cost- you can get out of there for $40 for 2 and have a good meal or you can get the higher end dishes which will run you a bit more. Great place and we will be back soon!",

I particularly like the lighting inside the restaurant; it's very relaxed and seems classier than it should be, given the location.

There were only one or two other parties in the restaurant and it took the waitress a rather long time to get to us.  I understand there was only waitress on at the time but the hostess and bartender were chatting at the bar while we waited for someone to pay attention to us.    My chicken was overcooked.  It was flavorful but tough. My wasabi mashed potatoes were tasty although there was no hint of wasabi whatsoever.    I had a mandarin mule that was okay but not great.    All in all, not a great experience.",

I ordered my steak medium rare- which is often hard to achieve these days, but it came out with a soft red center. Perfect! I can't remember feat wine I paired it with but the bartender was more than happy to make suggestions. It was bustling when I went it. Probably a little later than happy hour on. Tuesday, but packed. It had its regulars, so if you're planning on going in a large group make a reservation. Definitely will try this place again, next time cocktails and a different entree!",

    "text": "The Phoenix City Grill was described by friends as their local \"Cheers\" bar.   Well, I have to tell you something. Although a Norm *does* frequent this joint I'd rather come here ANY day over the tv version. This place is swank! (Sorry friends. Your description needs tweaking.)  I met my friends at the bar area. I parked out back and walked in via the kitchen area. I did NOT, however, realize I would be walking through a full on kitchen. NOPE. I closed the door in confusion. Double-checked the sign outside that said, \"Enter Here\" and proceeded. A very understanding employee provided me \"directions\" to the bar.   The bar zig zags around to the hostess stand. This is nice so everyone is not lined up like soldiers and conversations flows. There are standing height tables in the bar area as well. The restaurant section has booths (noted on the way to the bathroom) and copious seating. There is also a private room for events behind the elegant wall of wine.  Using the company's weekly email we scored a free appetizer. The \"Red chile pork tacos\" come two to a plate and are divine. Grilled pork tenderloin w/chipotle aioli & pineapple fennel salsa. YUM.  Having had a late lunch I could not possibly justify a decadent dinner. But I desperately wanted to after the tacos. Alas, no. Instead, I enjoyed a mouthwatering cup of the daily soup (Friday is the chicken tortilla).   The group shared something called \"Crispy Eggplant Bites\".   Goodness! Red pepper relish, goat cheese, arugula and a sherry vinaigrette are layered over a crispy heavenly crunchy shell. What this heaven is made of I should have asked. But no, I was too busy inhaling to inquire. (Four to a plate. Big enough for a group to share. IMO. However, I could see a tipsy person opting not to. This stuff is seriously good!)  I also fork sampled my neighbor's plate \"The Original Griddled Corn Cakes\". This is a neat mixture of sweet, spice and well, cheese. And I like cheese!  I'd say I'd come back and eat these things again. But NO. I want to try different things *next* time. Brunch looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g. So does lunch. And all the great entrees I had to pass on. (Aww man!)  With a full belly I understood the \"Cheers\" reference. You come here repeatedly.   If you sit in the bar area look for Jose, JP & David. All three bartenders seamlessly moved between guests without missing a beat. Our glasses were never empty.  Even though we were waited on by all three of them service was transparent.  Oh! And keep an eye out for the owner, Sheldon. He's making the rounds and greeting guests too!  This place is super popular for good reason. If you're coming for a special occasion or with a larger group (which they can readily accommodate) I'd recommend a reservation.",

Last night I went with a group of friends for a birthday celebration and was eagerly anticipating another great meal!  We sat in the bar first as we waited for all of our group to arrive.  We enjoyed cocktails before moving to our large table.  Our waiter was very attentive and told us about the nights specials.  We were disappointed to hear the meatloaf and pork chops had been removed from the menu but there were plenty of options to replace them.  Of our party of 8, I think 4 of us ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon!  One person ordered a pasta, one ordered the fish special of the night and I think two ordered steak.  We all devoured our meals and everyone commented on how delicious....especially the moist salmon!    For dessert we ordered two of the Chocolate Lava cakes and one Buttermilk Pie with Caramel sauce.  Again....devoured and delicious!  Prices are reasonable and the portions are ample.  If you haven't tried Phx City Grille you need to!  There are plenty of new options in the central Phx corridor and more keep popping up but lets keep supporting the old local favorites too!",

It's polished casual from the decor and the price point but the staff seems to be a veteran staff who has a firm commitment of being the local place where all the neighbors can enjoy a fantastic meal. We dined at the bar for happy hour and instructed the bartender to send us his favorites. We were impressed by all of his choices. The Green Chile Queso Dip was delicious and came out piping hot, the Sweet Corn Griddle Stack was surprisingly delicious. The pool of black beans toned down the sweetness of the cakes and the chicken and cheese stuffed inside made for a tasty bite. The only thing we didn't totally enjoy was the beet salad. For a beet salad we expected it to be beet heavy and it seemed to be more of an afterthought. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and we will be back.",

Place is in a strip mall ( I have an aversion to strip mall establishments), but overlooked that.  Walked in on a Tuesday evening and the place had a decent amount of patrons, so that was a good sign.  We started off with the bacon wrapped shrimp (yummy), the eggplant which I could have replaced with something else.  I ordered the pasta which was very good, the sauce wasn't too heavy which I liked.  My brother had the ribs which fell off the bone and came with fries and the portion was quite big.  My bf had the sea scallops which were cooked to perfection on a bed of mashed potatoes.  His dish was delicious but toward the end did start to feel a bit rich and heavy.  I also had a margarita on the rocks which they were generous with.  All in all, good experience and probably would go back if i were back in the area.",

This is a great place to host a gathering, from what I understand, management is very flexible and will work hard to fulfill all your requests and this is visible in the service and food offered. I would imagine that service and food is that same throughout the restaurant.  My first time there, not my last.",

Instead, we decided to trust the online reviewers who recommended PCG, and I can only say, we haven't been treated this well at a restaurant in a very long time. Everyone was go-out-of-their-way nice, from the hostess to the bartenders to the excellent waiter, who even comped our drinks and dessert because we had to wait 20 min. for a table (!).  That alone won us over.    As for the meal, the food presentation was lovely (I love \"stacked\" food :-)), and the short rib was fork-tender with a delicious sauce.  Hubby's peanut skewers were perfectly grilled and had a complimentary, not-too-sweet sauce.   The buttermilk pie with caramel sauce, though-- fantabulous!  So many choices, we'll have to go back for the shrimp, and the corn cakes, and....    Also, we really felt \"at home\" -- this place has such a cozy neighborhood feel, yet it's classy too, what with all the twinkly lights, greenery and lovely art.  Don't know why I never heard of this gem before, but the online rave reviews were right on.  A definite recommend!",

Some tasty appetizers, great entrees and the specials are pretty delectable.  The staff provides great service, some of them have been around for years.  Love the atmosphere.  One of my all-time favorite meals was at the PCG, well over a year ago, and I can't get it out of my head.  It was spicy grilled white fish served on andouille and potato hash over grilled sweet corn puree.  The fish was perfectly cooked - steaming hot on the outside and just set up inside, very moist.  The sweet corn and spicy sausage were awesome together, the meal was just incredible.  My friends were envious - I shared a few small bites :)  My red meat friends praise the steaks and lamb, I love their seafood entrees and the sauteed veggies.  Hearty portion sizes but not over the top.  Still haven't figured out the magic in those mashed potatoes!  I'd try to save a little room to share a dessert, great bread pudding!",

    "text": "My first experience with PCG was at a small, yet fantastic Yelp event.  I've been back twice and have been just as impressed.  The first time was for brunch, and I recommend the griddled corn cakes.  No, I just don't recommend them, I insist you have them.  Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.  The black beans were okay, but I do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon.  I was a big fan of a $4 mimosa, however!  Yep, you read that right...4 bucks!  Second visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).  Served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms, I believe, it will most likely be my next entree.  For dessert, we shared the Jack Daniel's croissant bread pudding.  We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.  Although, I generally don't care for bread pudding, this is NOT your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine (other than that one recipe that uses a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts).  Although PCG is a little bit of a drive for me (outside my usual 5-mile maximum radius), I will happily make that drive and return again.",

I recently revisited after a brief hiatus and discovered, to my delight, their Wedge salad that I donned with beef tenderloin. It easily disappeared in record time. I only stopped to take sips of my filthy vodka martini.  I am always reminded that this place can fit any occasion, from a romantic dinner to a night out with friends. They are always eager to accommodate! Brunch is nice and mellow as well.   If you're ever looking for a neighborhood staple, this should be in your rotation.",

I discovered this place when attending the Community Manager Yelp Event (CMYE), and was enticed by the flavors and array of dishes presented us. I made a special note to return for the bacon-wrapped shrimp soon!  I brought a date here for my return visit and insisted we order the shrimp appetizer. She loved it. Somehow PCG manages to crisp the bacon perfectly without overcooking the (somewhat huge) shrimp. The tartar-sauce like dipping sauce, however, was too creamy. It took away from sweetness of the shrimp and saltiness of the bacon. We found the vinaigrette on the bed of greens the shrimp were served on to be a better, brighter accompaniment, that did not take away from the other flavors.  Entrees were amazing. I had the cedar-plank salmon that came with horseradish mashed potatoes and citrus-marinated roasted beets. The warm beets really complemented the dish nicely--a well-composed and well-balanced plate that I won't soon forget. My date enjoyed the grilled beef tenderloin. I could not help but to steal a couple of her sherry-glazed mushrooms, when she wasn't looking. Swipe!  We topped off a perfect dinner with the warm croissant bread pudding. Great date destination and food that you will never forget.",

They must have an incredible staff as we've never had anything but excellent service there.",

However, the service has never been outstanding. My friends really like this place so we all meet there tonight. My friends(2 males) got there before i did. They had ordered wine and  had gotten me water.  The waitress, never told me the specials or even asked if i had any questions about the menu. She came right to the table asked me what i wanted to drink and then was back saying ,\"are you ready to order.\"   I felt rushed and ordered the roast beef. My friend  said to me, did you want roast beef or the pot roast? The waitress said,\" I ordered her the pot roast we don't have roast beef.\"  Yes, i am 5 and she cannot speak to me directly. So the food was good , service not so much. Not my favorite place to go. Plus i thought it was very high priced for what it was and we had to ask for bread. It does not come with the meal.",

We were served quickly, but the waitress didn't come check on us for several minutes. I needed mayonnaise for the burger, but I had to wait at least 10 minutes for the server to return to ask for it. I also had a mimosa. It was good, but the server never asked if I cared for another. The server only asked me if I wanted more water when it was time to leave the restaurant.  It also seemed to take awhile to get the check and pay for the food. The restaurant was only moderately busy, and it seems like they only had a few servers working. I really don't fault the server. It just seems like she was waiting on too many people.",

    "text": "Great rib eye fillet (mushrooms make it!) OK service (took some time) and from what my girlfriend says nice stiff tasty martini's. I have been trying to find a steak that matches the Circa 1900's filet mignon that I used to enjoy but since that was sold and is now Nobu I have yet to find one nearly as tasty. This one came close which I can say for more than many supposedly great steak houses.  Ruth's Chris for example along with the bitter taste of the non-deserved 200$ bill you get sub-par food with excellent service like that actually makes up for it. I am not saying they have a terrible steak but how different is it from a Filberto's version versus the ratio of what you pay for it doesn't add up. Christopher's and Noca(which I thought is where the crew from Circa went)comes to mind also as food at a higher price with great service but mediocre steak.  This steak was worth 32 or so bucks, My girlfriend thought the salmon was ok and the salad was nice. I liked the baked potato which had a nice kick to it.  Recommended: Filet with mushrooms martinis also the chili was quite nice also",

The waiter left us alone after bringing drinks taking our order for what seemed like 30 minutes, before telling me that what i ordered was 86ed. That was all fine and good, but when i re-ordered the turkey sandwich, that's not what brought me. It was a chicken sandwich and was missing it's main condiment to boot. I got a side of whatever was supposed to go on it, but I didn't realize the it was chicken instead of turkey until later, and by then, it was so late and everyone else was practically done eating, so i let it go. Overall, the food wasn't anything special and the service is definitely under-par",

    "text": "I live close to this location and always drove by but never stopped as the parking lot was always filled. My GF and I were celebrating getting new jobs and so we came in for dinner. No regrets. Only wished we had come by earlier. Being Restaurant Week we came and had the 3 course dinner. I had the wedge salad, beef short ribs and the warm chocolate torte. My GF had the eggplant salad, salmon and bread pudding. Wow! Dinners were so good! My salad was really fresh, it was a wedge, with  vinaigrette dressing one side and cream dressing on the other. It was a perfect starter, My GF had the eggplant salad which the eggplant was fried and crispy and topped with greens and that vinaigrette dressing. Delicious! The entrees were unbelievably so good! My beef short ribs was so tender and flavorful I was able to cut through with a fork. It came with mashed potatoes and a tasty sauce over. She had the salmon which was equally as tender and flavorful which came with beets. The third and final course was dessert. I had the warm chocolate torte with vanilla ice cream and my GF had the bread pudding. Perfect ending to perfect 3 course dinner. No complaints! Our bartender/server was David, very professional yet personable. Made sure we were comfortable and served our food promptly despite the restaurant/bar area getting crowded. Will recommend this restaurant to my friends and family. We will definitely be coming back again. It is that good!",

    "text": "I know I know I'm gonna get some flack because of this... but yelpers... my experience here was 2 stars for service and an additional star for food. I think a restaurant experience should match its rating caliber and sadly it did not. No four stars for fabulousness, it's three stars because it's ok and that's not shabby at all.  Went to dinner with the other half of our awesome pair... my besty Sara V. on a whim. We've been thinking alike lately... and while I was at work... I kept on thinking that it would be nice to go out to dinner... and unsurprisingly Sara V. was thinking the same too... I swear it's like we have ESPN or something! Anywho, I had her come up with the dinner choices since she knows I'm a really picky person (I say I'm not but I really am =P), she texted me the top 3... and I chose PCG since I had read Jana S. earlier review on the place and I've always wanted to try out this place!  Anywho, we got to the restaurant and I really like the intersection it's at, at Bethany Home Rd. and 16th St. coz it's across from Luci's Market and Richardson's, and an awesome looking Starbucks. In a strange way that intersection has a little character plus it's in an older section of upper central Phoenix. I like the setup with the tables outside and the large picture windows.   We were seated immediately at a two seater booth, noticed it was quite busy, and i liked the general ambiance of the place. We were thinking of the happy hour when we were heading there but were dismayed to read on their large easel board that hh tues. - fri. was from 3p to 6p but on Monday's it's from 3p to close. So we made a mental note that we'll come back for hh on Monday. We were seated and waited for our server, waters were dropped off, and our server passed with a passing remark \"I'll be right back\". Well she did come back after 10 mins. which I ordered a glass of reisling, and an order of the Roasted Green Chile Fundido Queso (ever since our trip in Austin for SXSW last year, we've been looking for a place that serves Queso as to satisfy our Queso fix from TX of which we have yet to find a place, maybe it's a Texas thing). My glass with a small carafe of wine was served... wet. The wine glass was wet! Like it had been just washed and they didn't take the time to dry the glass, no they served the glass WET and our server poured some of the reisling into the WET wine glass. Ok... there went a star. who serves wine in a wet glass?!? apparently PCG does. So, we're waiting to order, mind you, our server did not stop to give suggestions, mention the soup of the day, no we waited, and we had to ask for suggestions, and ask what the soup of the day was. Heck if you're a good restaurant, wouldn't you want to welcome your customers, who if you win them with good service and good food will come back, or are you happily satisfied with the customers and your fans that you're not interested in winning a few more? Ok... deep breath.   I ordered the PCG pasta as suggested by our server, and Sara V. ordered the Smoked Baby Back Ribs (rubbed in Chipotle bbq sauce). Oh did I mention that I had to ask for Sara V.'s water refill the first time round and flag her down to get a diet coke. Sara and I could see the poor girl was handling way too many tables to guarantee good service but that's no excuse. I think there's an expectation that a restaurant of such acclaim should provide great service.   The PCG pasta was quite good, liked the roasted garlic and chardonnay cream sauce, it wasn't overly creamy, loved the sun dried tomatoes though, it was delicious. Sara V.'s baby back ribs had a kick with them, it was spicy! and the green chile cornbread was okay not bandera's skillet corn bread good though. Oh, the queso was alright as well except i wish it was a little more thicker, this queso seemed too runny but it was a good starter nevertheless. We finished our meal with a slice of the buttermilk pie which had a caramel sauce and pomegranate seeds as garnish, which was the right accompaniment to something rich and sweet.   Overall the food was very good but the service had me wishing it was better and it did affect my overall dining experience. I will come back for the happy hour but I will have to pass on a glass of wine... unless they can guarantee it'll be served in a dry wine glass. And maybe some attentive service. So hopefully next time I'll get my four stars, we'll see.",

    "text": "The first thing I must say about the Phoenix City Grill is that the owner of this place ROCKS!!! All restaurant owners need to take a page out of this guys book. Reason in a second. Let's talk about food first.  I had the baby back ribs and the were awesome. Not quite as good as the baby backs from Houstons but pretty darn close. My girlfriend who loves PCG decided to go with something different this time around and ordered one of their signature dishes. It was some sort of chicken. I do consider myself a foodie so the first thing I was thinking is how can chicken be a signature dish? Chicken is boring no matter what you do with it. Anyway, it wasn't that good and the chicken comes on the bone which my girlfriend didn't like. So, since it was a signature dish, recommended by the waiter, I had to return it. My philosphy is that if something is recommended and is a signature dish and it doesn't give you a mouthgasim, it gets returned. So the waiter nicely takes it back and apologizes multiple times and asks if we would like something else. My girlfriend orders her old PCG standby, the Pork Tenderloin. Wow what a great pork dish. I don't care for pork that much but i must say i crushed half of it, it was amazing.  Do I even need to explain the choclate tort??? YUM  Back to the owner. We arrive at PCG at about 4pm to eat dinner, who eats at 4pm, you'd think we went for the early bird special. We get seated in the dining room and are the only ones in the dining room and no one comes out for like 10 minutes. So we move to the bar  and tell the bar tender we are going to eat at the bar because no one came out to greet us or take a drink order. He apologizes, bvut it was NO BIG DEAL. We weren't mad or complaining or anything. Remember earlier I mentioned the signature dish that got sent back. Well the owner comes over to us and says i understand you have had some issues today and we are like ah no problem the food was great yada yada yada. The owner is like NO BOTH of your meals are on me including dessert. We objected and were like you don't have to do that and he INSISTED. Who does this now a days in the restauran business? Most definately not Donovans.  Anyway to sum it up. PCG is awesome, the owner actually cares about his customers and everyone i tell this story to they are like i can't believe he did that. Go to Phoenix City Grille you won't be disappointed. KUDOS to PCG and especially you Mr. Owner, sorry I don't remember your name. I'll be for some ribs soon.",

    "text": "Phoenix City Grill is an institution, and it should be.  My second dinner out, after I moved here with the Beautiful Carin, was at PCG (the first was at Tuchetti's, dear departed Tuchetti's...maybe not the best Italian food in town, but truly...was there ever a dish that could fill you up like their baked spaghetti with meat sauce?...it must have been 5 lb's. of food on the plate...my dear sweet lord). Anyway...I met a friend at PCG for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get to pick...I don't get to pick the restaurants for client and friend lunches for a while...not since the sad and regrettable Frank & Lupe's incident. But, I was glad for change of pace...out of Old Town and my rut of wanting to walk everywhere I go.  I fired up the Edsel and off I went to 16th and Bethany Home for a revisit of a Phoenix classic! PCG is PDG (\"pretty damn good\") food and attentive service. Mark had gotten there a little before me and gotten a table. The waitress was there as I was sitting down.  Interestingly, Mark had gotten a big ol' glass of red wine to start lunch...a delightful way of lunching for business people that has fallen into disrepute over the past decade or so. I followed suit. We must fight this non-drinking at lunch scourge by taking every opportunity to imbibe at lunch, and I, for one, will help lead the fight! The menu hasn't changed very much over the past few years, but really, why screw around with what is working...the place is always full, everybody seems to enjoy their meals, including me BTW:), and they just go on printing money, year after year! What's not to like about that formula? They had some nice specials (including a bunch of seafood specials), but frankly, I rarely eat seafood at non-seafood specialty restaurants in the middle of the desert. I opted for the Cuban Hamburger.  A novel preparation, one that was highlighted by some of the tastiest pickles I have ever had on a burger! I actually do taste the food as I hoover it down:) PCG is still doing great and doesn't need anything more from me than my credit card for payment when the check comes...keep up the good work!",
