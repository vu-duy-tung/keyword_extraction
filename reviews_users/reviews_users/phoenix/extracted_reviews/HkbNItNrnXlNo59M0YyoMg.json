Well let's just say this will likely be my last time here. $12 got me two tiny, greasy, tasteless tacos. They were pretty much shredded, bland pork in a super greasy hard shell with shredded iceberg lettuce and a sprinkle of cheese. I asked for the sour cream/guac on the side, but the tacos were  missing the sauce that the menu states is included. They came with a side of cold rice and beans that were also tasteless at best. I would give 0 stars if possible, but the bartender was prompt and friendly!",

We had seperate checks for everyone but was charged a 18% gratuity. I'm assuming for a big party. Which makes no sense as we all paid seperate. Anyways that's not really the issue. Our server, Rachel S. Was horrible. Never checked on us, never asked for drink refills. We were all drinking beer and had plans on hanging out but our server was horrible and we got tired of not having our drinks refilled so we cashed out and went to the handlebar down the street and drank. The whole time we were there she was on her phone texting. I have no problem paying a pre calculated gratuity if you get good service. I figure she didn't care about us because she knew she was getting 18% off of each tab...so off  our table she got close to $30 which is crap because she was horrible. Being a server myself I pay close attention to this because I bust my ass for my tips and to see someone give customers crappy service and pocket tips that the customer had no option in paying is ridiculous.  I was not even in the mood to argue the gratuity,  I will just not go back. Very disappointing.",

We both were like what the hell are you talking about. I asked for the manager he told me to F off and com back and talk to the manager tomorrow.

Just got the bill and apparently they are actually $4.00. I politely pointed out that the poster clearly stated 'all day, every day'.   I was totally being friendly and honestly wouldn't have cared if I had to pay a couple extra dollars but the waitress was snotty and rudely explained that it was a busy weekend and \"you know, we raise prices when we're busy. Really!?   Having managed restaurants myself, I get that, but you're seriously going to TELL customers that? She then explained \"it's in the computer that way and you can talk to the Manager if you want\".   Again, arguing over a couple dollars is not my style but after being talked to like I was an annoying cheapskate, I said yes, please, send the Manager over.   The Manager came over and explained that sometimes their vendors put up posters and they weren't aware of it but that he would have them taken down.   Whatever... I hate taking this much time to write a review. Especially a bad one. I prefer to be positive.   Bottom line, I am now the proud owner of a cool 'most interesting man in the world' poster and I really shouldn't have expected a 20 year old to be able to explain the pricing discrepancy any better.  The Manager handled the situation well and I appreciated it.   Taylor, our second waitress, was fantastic!",

A few seconds after I sat myself, my server brought chips and fresh salsa to the table. I had the Chicken Tortilla Soup and it was comforting and delicious. There were diced avocados in it! I'm only giving 4 stars because there were little birds hopping around inside the restaurant. I feel extremely uncomfortable around birds so I was on edge each second.",

    "text": "Went back with some friends (it was convenient honestly); and was really disappointed.  Innitially sat by the bar; moved within seconds cause the bartender had an attitude... Not welcoming at all. Seriously, quit your job if you can't deal with people.  Sat in a high table. Waitress had a smile, but was not attentive.  Between forgetting the waters, taking forever to come take our orders, never cared to offer more chips, making us feel rushed \"WHENEVER\" she was by the table; what pissed me off is just having us wait for the bill to be picked up for quite awhile as she and other staff members walked by it. Eventually someone else (not her) picked it up.... I just didn't get it. Being that it was NOT busy. If it was busy, especially being a saturday night, then okay; give you a pass & a decent tip for trying. But nobody there cared. And being my 3rd time with the lack of a caring service; it's not a \"bad night\" excuse.   Oh. The food sucked too.  I thought I was the only one, but when the 3 others complained about lack of taste and the meat being hard & rubbery; I knew I wasn't being a diva!  Lol!   And I don't know who picks the music, they might have the worse DJ on Mills.... From Ol' Dirty Bastard & Tupac to EDM; it was hard to get a rhithym going there!!!!   DEF THE LAST TIME! :(",

    "text": "Service was bad even for a bro bar.  Found this place while looking for food shortly after the Super Bowl. Big banner out front said \"Super Bowl Party till 2am\". The bouncer assured us the kitchen was still open and invited us in.  The place still had a few people in it but no problem getting a bartender right away and asking for a menu with our drinks. We then looked over the menu and purposely ordered something that would require a minimal amount of effort to make and clean up in case the cooks had already started to close down the kitchen. That was the last time we ever talked to our bartender or any other staff in the building.  After about 20mins I personally went to check on the status of our nachos as the kitchen is open for the public to view. I saw the forgotten nachos burnt under the heat lamp. We were the only people to order food so I can see how it might be easy to forget. I mentioned something to a cook to remind him about the nachos then went back to my empty drink at the bar. Another 10mins or so before the cook took initiative and delivered us a plate of nachos that was not only burnt but now had been sitting so long they were cold. I might add the toppings were pretty light. Its a stretch to label this plate of chips \"nachos\". By now the crowd had dwindled to mostly employees on or off the clock. It took another 10mins or so before anyone wearing a loco patron shirt came to check on us. I then told the bartender to forget about the nachos and bring the bill for the drinks. No wait on that.   If you want to just close down and have an employees only party then drop some hints before i waste precious time thinking I've found food and drinks still open on a Sunday night. Take down your signs that boast you'll be open till 2am. And if you forget someone's nachos and get called out on it, have the decency to at least reheat and sprinkle some fresh tomatoes on those stale ass chips before serving them.",

The BF finished his and wanted another. The guys behind he bar just kept walking by and ignoring us. Then we get the attention of who we thought was a bartender.  When we said excuse me, he screamed (no really, he did) that he was just the bar back. The BF asked how are we supposed to know that, and the bar back continued to harass and yell at us.  When the bartender came over, we explained how rude the bar back was and he totally tried to justify the bar back's attitude.  So, we asked them to close out the tab and the bartender charged it to my credit card even though I wanted to pay cash which I told them that when I opened my tab .  The tab was $12.02 and I left $0 (first time I've ever done this) in tip seeing as how rude these idiots were.  Well, guess what?  When I got my credit card statement they added $3 for tip! So not only are they rude idiots but thieves as well.  Nice.  Well, I'll get the $3 back as I've disputed the $3 additional charge with the credit card company but for sure it will cost Loco Patron a lot more than $3 in lost revenue.  Not only will we never return but we will warn everyone we know, to stay away.  Way to go Loco Patron!!!!",

Ben, Jeremy and Tanner are absolutely wonderful bartenders. They are always friendly and go out of their way to make their customers feel welcome. The atmosphere they bring to Loco is different than any of the other bars/restaurant on mill. Second, the food is absolutely delicious. It has had the same wonderful taste for the past two years. I love their salsa and would highly recommend it. Also, their ground beef tacos and crunchy fish tacos are to die for. Finally, the price is great for the amount and quality of the food, as well, as any alcoholic beverages. Taco Tuesday prices are fantastic and a great way to go out with a group of friends if you're on a budget. Anytime I have company come in from out of town my first stop is Loco (the mill location). They have always been highly impressed too. I would HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend stopping in for a bite to eat or a delicious margarita at this Loco Patron location.",

Super tasty and filling and well worth the price. But to be honest I almost left after tasting the Salsa they brought out. It was more water or what passes for a liquid and less a tomato based app with flavor than anything else. It did have some flavor but I only noticed that after trying a spoonful. Because I couldn't get enough on a chip to do more than lightly wet the poor thing. I'd imagine they put less effort into the first thing you taste to drive off those that only want a beer and a snack and then leave. In my view, the first thing you taste should be stellar and inspire you to try more of the food. My rating is for the Poke' only.",

From 3pm-Midnight you can score great tasting food and margarita's for an affordable price. $1.00 Tacos, $4.00 Wings in various flavors, $4.00-$5.00 Margarita's and much more. The ladies at my table enjoyed the Strawberry Margarita's at $5.00 a piece. Freshly made and brought to your right away they helped wash down our $1.00 Tacos and upgraded Steak, Fish Taco's for $2.00 bucks. Even though we were given Chips and Salsa to start our food came so quick it was quite the surprise not having to wait long for our food.   Service was great. We started at the bar and were served by a friendly bartender then we headed to a table near the DJ booth and was served by a server who was on the ball. I mentioned DJ because they have one from 7pm-Midnight. DJ Matt in the hat took our request and spin the night away.   You don't have to be a starving student to enjoy Taco Tuesdays. We were a bunch of business woman who needed a night out and it was worth every penny. Will do it again!",

Ok...we worker bees start at 5am-7am, because our counterparts are on the east coast. So, we all get off between 3pm-5pm.    Loco Patron had great HH specials.  Beers were cheap and the marg's were inexpensive.  The marg's were okay.  I am not a fan of sour drinks...they were nothing special.  Chips and salsa were comp...nice touch.  The service was okay...even at 3ish.  I really don't recall anything that made this place special, we brought such a large group and it was ok.

    "text": "Loco Patron has long been a fixture on Scottsdale Road in Old Town Scottsdale, but I've always gone there more for the margaritas and barcrawler atmosphere than for the food. I haven't had any food at the Scottsdale location in several years, but I was highly impressed with the amazing happy hour offerings I sampled from the new Tempe location, which opened this past December on Mill Avenue right by the light rail.  Their happy hour runs from 3-7 p.m. daily and features a ton of hearty food options for very little moolah. On my recent visit there, my boyfriend and I shared tostadas ($5) and tacos ($3), which were basically the same thing, save for different cheeses -- go for the tacos with a corn tortilla and cojita cheese instead of their shredded mix, and you should be good.  We also got a cheese crisp, a steal at only $2! The food was all great and a really phenomenal value for the portion you got, too.  Plus, you get free chips and salsa with any meal, so we were definitely feeling full without spending a ton.  Besides the great food offerings, happy hour drinks are worth the visit, too, with $3 beers, wine and wells and jumbo beers starting at only $4.25. The Mill Avenue location also features a cool patio overlooking the busy street, and there's a huge bar and tons of televisions broadcasting sports throughout the venue. The service was fast and friendly, and it's nice that it's conveniently located to the light rail in case you have too many margaritas.",

Were big fans of the wings at the original Loco location, and now we dont have to go all the way to Scottsdale for them (like its far, but I digress).  This location is about twice the size (inside) of the Scottsdale location. It was clean and theres a variety of different places to sit. We chose the bar tops in the corner. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We had our Loco staples: the salt and pepper wings (so, so good), and tacos. I actually tried the shredded pork taco this time as opposed to the steak one I usually get and I was not disappointed.  Loco has some great daily specials (taco Tues, wing Wed, etc) and their happy hour specials are great.  Im sure this will become a Mill Ave staple.",

    "text": "This Loco Patron location just opened this week so take this review with a grain of margarita salt. They could very well improve.  I'm a sucker for good margaritas and have seen the signs announcing this joint for months, so when I saw it open I had to take a look.  My first impression is that they've built a nice little sports bar, but furnished it like a Mexican food joint. TVs all over the wall and bar, saccharine pop/rock playing over the speakers, and a rustic cabinet where they keep straws, napkins, and the servers' purses. It's a medium-sized place, not big enough for a huge crowd, but it'd likely handle about half an hour of a pub crawl stop before the place got uncomfortable and folks moved on.  I sidled up to the bar and asked for a house margarita and a menu, both came back quickly along with a free mini-basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was actually really good, mild for the gringos but just a little kick on the backend. The margarita, on the other hand, was pretty awful. It had the right color, but the guy at the bar used way too much sweet and not nearly enough sour. It tasted like a flat sprite. I also couldn't tell if there was actually alcohol in there, which is never a good sign.  I ordered fajitas and those were also a little sweet for some odd reason. Maybe not enough salt when they cooked it up, I don't know. In any case, it was edible but not at all remarkable.   When the bill came the barman rang me up for the wrong dish, overcharging me, but when I pointed out the mistake he quickly fixed it so no real harm done.  Mill Avenue has a bunch of existing Mexican food places, all with their own charms, and I don't understand why a business owner thought Mill Ave. needed another. So far these folks aren't doing anything which sets them apart from the others and I'd be surprised to see them still open this time next year. That said, I'd welcome improvements that prove me wrong. The ball is in your court, Loco Patron.",

We were neither rude nor \"too intoxicated.\" There were only about 8 people in the bar so you would think he would let a big group in and leave it up to the bartender to serve or not serve.

    "text": "Omg amazing is really all I can say. I'm from out of town and was just walking around and stumbled upon this place. At first glance it looks like a hipster bar that serves frozen burritos, but the moment your food arrives prepare to be amazed. I had the smothered burrito and my girl friend had the chicken fajitas. Neither of us were able to finish the portions are great. Everything perfectly seasoned. Only thing I was unsure about was the Coleslaw but it went perfectly on my burrito. Oh and don't forget about there cherry limeade cocktail, just the right amount of sweet and fruity. Pretty sure everytime I come to Pheonix this is going to be a mandatory stop.   The quality of the food is matched by the quality of service you receive, our server was very cheerful and everyone was dressed nice and the restaurant was very clean. If you are in Scottsdale this is a must.",

    "text": "We had just completed hiking Hayden Butte, as we normally do most Monday's.  My wife and I were both famished, and I wanted to catch a glimpse of Game 7 of the Warriors vs Thunder game.   We heard the cheers from all the way across the street; therefore, we made our way across Mill Avenue Loco Patron. We've never eaten here before, and this was to be a first for us.   As we entered the premises; Keala, our server promptly greeted and seated us at a booth that gave us ample view of most of the screens - absolutely perfect!  We were going to enjoy a nice dinner, and I was going to get to watch the Warriors move on to the finals. However, much to my dismay, at this time, the Warriors were down 11 points.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi Tacos, and my wife had the Steak street tacos. Both of these were just okay. Nothing special, as far as we were concerned. But, the service provided by Keala was pleasantly efficient. By the time we had finished our meal, the Warrior managed to erase the point deficit and now had a significant 10 point lead, but the game wasn't over yet.  In order to prolong our visit, we ordered dessert in the form of the Sopaipillas, and the Fried Ice Cream. I should've checked the description and inquired as to their sizes because when they were served to us, there was enough here for 4 people.  Needless to say, we didn't even come close to consuming the dessert. But, it definitely was the highlight of our meal. They were both quit delectable. Along with the Warrior's victory, this was quite a pleasant experience for the both of us.   A decent meal, with dessert, and our favorite team moving on to the Finals!",

The bar looks good, and it probably gets quite busy on the weekends during the college season. $8.25 for a 25oz Shandy, not bad, but could get that at BWW for about $4-6.  Ordered a few tacos, shredded chicken and the steak with corn tortillas. Got smashed potatoes and rice for sides, and I'd recommend it. The tacos are a decent size. The avocado cream was good, maybe I'd like to see real sliced avocado but still good. It was a little slow in the bar but it was also 3:30p on a Saturday in July.  If I'm back in the area sometime I'd consider stopping in.",

    "text": "I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by Loco Patron.  I'd seen the location in Old Town but never really thought to try it.  We were headed to Blasted Barley because I know they had the fight on. Parked and started walking down Mill, noticing that the fight was on I chose to go in and pay the cover.  Although as a bar with as many patrons seated they could have just kept to the $40 per table minimum as a couple we exceeded healthily.  Our waitress Keali was extremely fast to serve our table once we came into her section.  we were going to set up in the bar area but the table was in an awkward locale and I feared lack of service.  We moved to the northern end with the windows open.  I ordered the Street and crunchy fish tacos.  I think my Fish taco would have been much better had I chose not to take my time and gotten after it.  The Chipotle Aoli and additional Salsa made the flavors on point.  The Street taco though...the flavors were epic.  My girlfriend ordered the coconut shrimp tacos...had the sweetness part of the flavor, but the coconut was over the top for me.  She also had the Island pork taco, it was ok.  The chips and salsa were good.  I ordered the Cali Cream Ale and the Strawberry Margarita and the lady had the straight margaritas.  Keali wasn't around to be annoying, but she was there at every critical moment to ask about our food and drinks.  Definitely a fun place to watch a fight and easy sell to eat again should I be out of ideas.",

I preferred to go when it was not busy so I did not have to wait long for service. I sat on the outdoor patio, so the only bad thing about the place that I experienced was a homeless pan handler approach me on the patio and approach one other couple that was eating outdoors. If I had been sitting inside, this man would not of bothered me. However, the staff at Loco Patron asked the homeless man to leave. The bartender was extremely nice and I was satisfied with how the staff handled the situation with the vagrant. But I did go back to Loco Patron 3 days later and I saw the same homeless man hanging around the patio area again.",

It has a really nice bar though with tv's that can be watched inside and outside. I can see this place popping for night life because when we went for HH, it wasn't very busy. Service was also a bit slow, I remember commenting to my friend about how long it took for us to receive our food. All in all I was glad to have tried it and would probably return.",

I wish the mimosas went later than 1 pm but we definitely get our money's worth because the service is good. I am not a brunch food person, so I always stick with the lunch options. I love that they actually have some healthier options (tomato queso salad with avocado is my favorite) and equally love to indulge in the tacos with a side of smashed potatoes or the trio (which is now pineapple salsa, queso and guacamole-all delicious!). If I'm going to be on Mill, this is definitely where I'd go, especially during the day time/happy hour.",

I went twice on this trip and each time every bartender that interacted with us was very pleasant. Chips and salsa were just okay, but the tacos were pretty dang good, and the dessert cookie ice cream thing was ridiculously great. One complaint, they allow people to smoke in the \"outdoor\" patio area which has a sliding garage door separating from inside, so basically they're smoking inside and you can smell it.",

The servers and cooks were all still learning, so I won't make a mention of the service quality, but the food left something to be desired. The cheese seemed like it was out of a Kraft shredded cheese ziploc from the grocery store and the tortillas were bland as could be. The meat was pretty good though! I had the pork, chicken, and beef (1 taco each) and I enjoyed it. Chips and salsa was pretty damn good and pretty damn free, so plus points there.  We got in a few minutes past happy hour, but they still honored happy hour prices for the first few minutes of our stay--that was pretty cool of them to do; that gesture earned them my return visit. The place is in a very nice, commercial looking building literally on the Mill Ave light rail stop. I feel like this will soon (give it a few years) become the replacement for Barney's on University (RIP) just because of how easy it is to get to. Bathrooms were clean and there is an AMAZING view of \"A\" Mountain from the inside bar and the patio.  I look forward to LP's future on Mill.",

I couldn't eat it:/ guess we are spoiled in CA.  Their Margaritas  were delicious.  I had amazing company, so we had a good time. I would go here only to drink and watch a game.

    "text": "Man let me tell you something - this place is great. I come here for lunch all the time - like, way too often. Lemme break it down:  Food: Every damn thing on the menu is great. You want my recommendation? Order whatever sounds good to you because it's gonna be great. And then get the smashed potatoes as a side. And get a beer too - they've got a decent selection.  Service: It's always the same girls working here, and they're always pretty cool and professional at the same time, you know what I mean? Like, orders are fast and right, and good - I've had them get an order wrong and then before we even notice it's wrong they bring out whatever was missing or something like that - that's cool. And in general it seems like people are fairly happy to be working here, which is nice. I don't need people to be freakin' stoked about getting drinks and tacos for me, but like, make it feel like we're all hanging out and having an alright time, you know? And if the service isn't fast enough for you, just have another beer and relax about it already.  Atmosphere: TV's all over the damn place. I actually hate having TV's in places I eat because I end up watching whatever stupid thing is on that I don't care about. Like I was here during the world cup, and I don't give a damn about soccer - but here I was watching it. Whatever. Most people like that stuff, so if you want to watch TV then you're in luck - there's probably gonna be 4 damn TV's wherever you're looking. They've got some weird stuff all over the walls too, like a sign that says \"Dudes: no shirt, no service; Ladies: no shirt, free drinks\" or something like that. I don't think it's actually True though because I've never seen anybody take their shirt off in the place, and I think it'd be an issue with the health code. Anyway, the whole place has a pretty good vibe that works well in the hot Phoenix summer.  Definitely recommend it.",

Service was nice and they start off everything with free chips and salsa so that's awesome. For food, we order a number of things, but I went with the Fajitas, which was a ton of food. Everything was decent, though if you're deciding between the chicken and the steak, I'd definitely go with the chicken, which was more flavorful and moist. Everything comes in pretty big cuts, so be prepared to take a knife to the sizzling plate. Also, be prepared to spend half the meal swatting away flies. Loco Patron would be a pretty solid place to grab some drinks and watch the game since they have a bunch of TVs and a solid island bar area.",

I like the large TVs that have various games on display. That is a nice touch and adds to the atmosphere.  The one thing I didn't like is that things get really noisy. I was shouting most of the night just to talk to the person I went with. I couldn't hear everything he was saying to me so I had to keep asking him to repeat himself. I felt kind of bad about that.  It's not really Loco Patron's fault. Things tend to get rowdy at any place there is a bar/ alcohol is served. It did make talking to the people I was with kind of difficult though.  If not for the noise, I would definitely rate Loco Patron five stars. I just have to take one off because it was hard for me to talk to my friends and it got kind of frustrating through the night. I'm not sure if there is anything they can do about it. It's probably more of a personal preference more than anything else.  Other than that, I really enjoyed my experience at Loco Patron. I will definitely be going back again. I think next time I will sit in their outdoor area however to avoid the noisy atmosphere inside.",

Around 9pm on a Friday, it wasn't that busy and we were able to get seats at the bar.  It would be a good place to watch a game since they have TVs everywhere.  The food here was surprisingly good. For $12 you can get two tacos and two sides.  I ordered a fish taco and a shrimp taco, but they brought two fish instead.  Luckily, their Crunchy Fish Taco is really good.  The cabbage, avocado cream and pico de gallo went well together and the beer battered cod stayed crunchy.  The refried beans and Spanish rice are good sides, but small portions.  You wouldn't think to get wings at a Mexican place, but I recommend getting their salt & pepper Loco Wings (12 for $10).  They're not that big, but they're tasty.  This a cool place to hang out with your friends.  It's the type of place I would've frequented when I was in college.",

Just ten I was told my order was ready this whole time and they brought it out just before the check came. I explained that I didn't have any more time to eat and then noticed I was charged in full. So I am about $13.00 deep and I still have not had lunch.. If I could leave  less starts I would!!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I always start here when we decide to come to mill.  This is our go to.  I have to say we haven't eaten here a whole lot, but when we have the food is great!  Great quality food for a great price.  You  can tell the beans don't come from a can and that the salsa is made in house every day.    We usually just sit at the bar and drink before we start our night, for happy hour or to catch a game/event downtown.  The service is exceptional at Loco bar none.  We always are well taken care of at loco and haven't had even the slightest bad experience.    For instance, yesterday we stopped in for a few drinks and there was some miscommunication between the guys working the bar.  We didn't get a drink as soon as we usually do, but the guy that was helping us was more than apologetic and even bought us a free round!  A tasty little treat.    Loco plays the best music out of any bar on mill.  A good mix between 90's and current EDM but very relaxing overall.  Just what I am in the mood for 99% of the time.    Clean place, great food, great service! What is not to love!",

All in all, it was okay, with the other restaurants in this neighborhood, we could have chosen much better!",

We came in it was a group of five and we told her we were doing separate orders by two couples and one single guy she messed up our orders after we told her exactly what to charge on what which is fine okay everyone makes a mistake but she came back around we noticed she charged us all wrong and told her to correct it and told her exactly what cards were for what and she said she understood and shed void it and again she ended up charging us for the wrong thing basically she made the same mistake 3times. Also our other friend paid in cash and she didn't even offer to give him his change back she just pocketed the money and he was going to tip either way but it's a common respect thing to give the change back plus someone so dumb does not deserve 25% tip sorry",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Loco Patron Tempe, and been visiting this location twice a week or more for over a year. It helps that I work upstairs in the building :). The food is always excellent, the server staff is exceptional espicially Alicia and McChrista, the atmosphere is always inviting.  The new menu (adopted from the Scottsdale location) is good, the new street tacos are excellent but I miss my Monday lunch special (3 enchiladas). Change is inevitable, so I adjust my priorities and move forward. This review covers the past when I should have posted glowing reviews many times, espicially during the FIFA World Cup. I highly recommend this location to many of my friends and co-workers with much enthusiasm.  They are not perfect, hence 4 stars, during busy times the server and kitchen staff can create longer wait times as they race to satisfy everyone's needs. May I suggest a cool iced tea or adult beverage of your choice and RELAX while you wait. The food will be well worth it once it arrives! Thanks for listening.      A long time loyal fan",

    "text": "So far, so good. They are a brand new location, but they fit my basic requirements: the food is good, and well-priced. Service was speedy and courteous - almost too courteous, since we were asked if we were doing okay maybe seven times or so. Parking close to this place can be a pain (typical of Mill Ave), but it's a nice and casual spot to unwind for a laid-back lunch. Conveniently right next to a light-rail stop.  It's a typical sports bar meets casual mexican food place. Lots of television screens showing sports games and CNN, a good-sized bar, what looks to be a decent spot for a live DJ (maybe for special events or weekends?), and fun and tacky airbrush decor on the walls of a mexican oasis. I have no opinion on the drinks (since we didn't try any), but once the food arrived (fairly quickly), everything we tried was good. Service was friendly, and the noise level was great at the time we went (mid-day). We found out that they have a punch card, to get a free lunch after you go through five or so. Sounds good to me.  Obviously still a new location that's working out some kinks, but it's off to a good start.",

I try to come here every Taco Tuesday, and have been like that for the past two years. There's a Loco in Tukee that I used to go to, but they charge more for drinks and the tacos are never as full. I'm always amazed by how well the staff handles the Taco Tuesdays, where I expect they are extra busy but always get my order out quickly and never seem stressed or rude. Whenever I'm having a dinner with friends or family from out of town, I come here. If it's a Tuesday, I can tacos for $1 and feel full, and a $4 margarita. I come on normal days too because i can always expect the food to be consistent, but I'm a bargain eater at heart.   Just remember that tacos are normally more expensive, so when you tip, tip off of the normal price, not the Tuesday bargain. Especially if you come back often like me.   My only real complaint is the DJs are often too loud. I get trying to make it more of a party place to compete with the other places on Mill.... but if it's too loud I feel rushed and can't talk to my friends! But if you come early enough, there's no DJ anyways, haha.",

So I after I finish taking my maternity pictures on mill ave, my friend that goes there every Saturday to eat ceviche takes me there, he wanted me to try the ceviche so i order some ceviche it's was excellent, then what I thought It was a hot pepper seed because I bit in to it and it hurt my tooth. It was Glass it was huge. I wasn't really that mad because I work in the industry on mill ave for 7 years I know things can happen. So I just told the server, the server told someone else they came they told they will take care of me and I wouldn't had to pay for anything. The server told me to me if it was me \" I would you ask for more I'll Would be so mad\" so I order 2 shoots of tequila and that's it.  So the bill came out and I was like bill???  So I ended up paying  for everything except the the 2 ceviches glass bowls lol. My pregnant girlfriend was furious. But I was like whatever I'm not going to make a big deal but then I just kept thinking about it and how everybody that work there expect the server we're nonchalant like it was nothing. One the manager even suggested that it was the hard part of the shrimp then she saw it. Anyways maybe I should had made a scene since the piece of glass could had gone to my Esophagus and cut me and probably would had poop blood from my ass . Or could had aspirated glass and ended up in the hospital.  But I guess it's only worth a bowl of ceviche",

We ordered a few drinks including the classic margarita, froze and Stella and all were great. We ordered some tacos, enchiladas and fajitas. We enjoyed them, but the ahi tuna ones were pretty low quality and not super great. I'd stick with some more traditional tacos next time. Fun atmosphere, I'd love to go back at night sometime!",

Today we had the margarita special for $5 and a Dos Equis XX for $4 a pint.  We shared the island soft taco, the mahi mahi taco, with a side of black beans and coleslaw.  All was excellent. Our favorite was the island. Fresh pineapples and tuna.  The mahi mahi had like a 1000 island dressing on it.  Not opposed.  Just not my favorite.  The chips and salsa they sit in front of you as soon as you sit down.  So the chips don't have that fresh baked taste but the salsa was not over salty which I appreciate.  It allows you to taste the cilantro, jalapenos and tomatoes.",

My wife enjoyed a $5 margarita, while I tapped a Dos Equis Amber draft on the shoulder. Ice cold, just the way I need it in the desert. Our food was delivered quickly and was delicious. I had the chicken poblano enchiladas and my better half had the crispy pork tacos. This establishment is known for their tacos, but the enchiladas were the star of my fork to mouth affair. Large chunks of white meat chicken wrapped in a thick corn tortilla, and smothered in a creamy green sauce. Amazing!  The atmosphere is college bar chic, and we enjoyed the copious sports being televised on the screens above. We will be back!",

Being on mill, it's a good pregame place with decent Mexican food. I'm not super picky, so I can live with the food not being the absolute best. When you're drunk you don't really care anyway (lol). The happy hour also has some good deals, it's pretty cheap. A fun drink that they have is a barbitini. It's basically a giant fishbowl drink with a Barbie in it. Anyway, I love coming here to start early before we all go out on mill! I also have brought my parents here before ASU game days and to watch NFL games. It's a really great spot to watch sports!",

    "text": "Waiting here with a big group of people,  maybe around 10 to 15 people around 7 p.m. on a weekday. Waitress was pretty quick, in terms of getting the food down. She took a bit longer with getting the drink orders down. The place was definitely busier as time went on. We only had the one waitress for the whole night.  Price And Food: So I went on a Taco Tuesday. They had tacos and the $2 and $3 range. I tried the shredded beef and shredded chicken tacos which were both $2 each. I also have the crunchy fish taco which was $3. They only gave one lime on the side, but you could ask for more. Both the shredded beef and chicken tacos were just average. They both want anything that was too special. However, the crunchy fish taco was pretty decent. There's a type of dressing that they put on top that gives it more of a flavor.  We definitely recommend trying the crunchy fish taco. However, maybe try something else besides the beef and chicken taco. I did not get to try the other types of tacos that they had, but they still had a few more in the $2 and $3 range.  There were also maybe two or three drinks that were on the taco Tuesday drink menu special, for around 4 to $5.   Atmosphere: Inside is pretty big and spacious. They have some booths along the wall. There's some back seating. There's seating around the bar. Main thing to note: there's a DJ playing extremely Loud EDM Music You may or may not like that. I was fine with the music, but they could turn down the volume a little bit.  Parking: There's meter parking along Mill Avenue. There's also a parking garage somewhere in the back, which is supposed to be free after 5:30. I did not use it but somebody else did.  Overall, if you want to try to Tacos here, definitely come on on Tuesday for the specials. Tacos were okay but nothing too special. Would definitely still recommend trying other places, if you're still looking for your taco place in Phoenix.",

Plus, with charging $1 for each basket of chips (1st one free) you'd think it would be a bigger basket with better salsa.  Also our server would rush by and we would have to try to waive her down to order more. Only a few times she asked if we wanted another drink or more water.  Felt very negleted. I understand it's St paddy's day, but on that kind of a holiday, you would stress customer service and over staff  Especially with an all day concert up the road.",

I went with a group of friends on taco tuesday/final basketball game, which i understand gets super busy but a good server doesn't make excuses. My server was very nice but never refilled my ONE glass of water and took her THREE times to bring me a lemon wedge (by the time she brought it I was 2 tacos in of my 3). Finally, my total came to $8.20. I was the only one of my 6 friends paying in cash so i put a $10 bill and .80 cents down. She came back and gave everyone else their cards and walked away! She still owed me $2 and she just took them! I honestly wasnt even going to tip her but LUCKILY FOR HER she got to STEAL my $2, way to go Kenadee!",

They have a great beer selection on tap, and sitting at the outdoor bar in good weather is primo. Food is prepared quickly, so this is a decent option for the \"I'm starving and need to eat now\" or the \"I just need some tacos, here's $10.\"   First of all, why has the free chips & salsa courtesy disappeared from so many places?This salsa isn't my favorite, but it's passable and on the house. I've tried an array of the seafood tacos and liked the mahi mahi best. The lobster was pretty bad - tasted like surimi (fake crab + tacos = grimace) - and the shrimp taco was uber sweet for my taste though some people may like that. The smashed potatoes were a bit bland, but the black beans were super delicious. If you're a corn tortilla lover, I think they do them well here.   I don't see the need to comment on the waitstaff, as I have pretty low expectations for this type of place and it's location on Mill. Quick tacos with at least one good option plus decent craft beer is what warrants 3 stars in my book.",

The salsa that came with the chips had too much lime.  Tasted like lime juice and the chips were store bought.    I ordered the crunchy fish tacos.  Crunchy indeed it was, but again what's up with the lime.  I added a little bit on my tacos and again it was too much.  The guacamole sauce atop wasn't bad, but my tacos were overly seasoned already.  The crunchiness was there along with the cabbage mellowing it out; that was a nice welcome.  The rice and beans were out of a can as expected.  In the end, probably come for drinks but that's about it. - Enjoy!",

Perhaps my favorite meal at Loco is brunch, though. I love their divorced eggs with enchilada sauce. It pairs well with their habanero bloody Marys.  Drinks are reasonably priced and service is outstanding. I hosted a pretty large group at Loco Patron on a football saturday. The restaurant was very busy, but we still had outstanding service. No one in my party had an empty drink in his/her hand for very long, which is quite impressive given the crowd and the propensity for my friends to consumer alcohol. Long after that event, I'm still having people say what a great time they had at Loco.  In short, my favorite place on Mill.",

The crunchy fish I heard was good as well, but the $4 frozen or on the rocks margarita was perhaps the best item. Free chips and good salsa of course and a fast efficient staff was handling the college kids (and me) just fine. The amount of TV sets was perfect also as you can the action from almost anywhere.

The weather was nice out so I chose a table by the large window /  open patio area. The waitress was nice and provided the complimentary chips basket and water while I waited for my friends.   There's a good breakfast selection ( the lunch menu was also available). Both my friend and I are suckers for french toast so we both ordered it while my other friend ordered the breakfast burrito. Being a French toast connoisseur, prior to ordering, I specifically asked the waitress if the french toast was made with \" thick, Texas Toast like bread\", she said yes. Well, the food came out and she placed in front of us thee most PA-THE-TIC French toast I've ever had!!! It wasn't Texas toast bread. Or brioche. Or any other thick, hearty bread typically used for French toast... It was a regular ol' booooring sandwich sliced bread. Two slices of the bread cut in half with bananas thrown on top. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. The party I was with were conservative and didn't want me to complain and so I just sucked it up. Both my friend and I ate the measly \"anorexic bread\" (as we later jokingly called it) up in all of five to six bites with a quickness and was still left hungry!!! Meanwhile, we salivated over the thiiick, full breakfast burritos our other friend was struggling to eat/finish. The burrito was monstrous sized and looked very good! I doubt I will ever go back here, at least not for breakfast, but if I do, I will avoid the French toast like the plague and go with the burrito!",

Chips and salsa are very unflavorful and the food in the kitchen seems like it's coming out from someone that hates their job. I'll have to try one of the other restaurants on Mill Avenue next time.",

The ambience of the place left a lot to be desired though. There was like this gigantic speaker pumping out music right next to our table. To be honest, it didn't get better when we moved tables. The whole place was like a Great White concert. No chance for conversation and the beer prices are crazy even for Scottsdale.   Would not recommend as there are way better places to eat a taco in peace in the city.",

    "text": "I'd say Loco Patron itself isn't a bad establishment, in fact I used to eat at the Old Town Scottsdale location all the time when I worked right by there. The food isn't bad and the drinks are pretty decent. All in all I haven't had a bad experience there until last Saturday.  See, I enjoy the crunchy fish tacos. While some may day it's a risky move at a diveyer establishment, I'm a rebel I suppose. This last meal did prove my idiocy though because I spent the next day and a half in a sickened stupor, waking up every hour to go yak the food back up. I didn't get over it until I chugged some pepto and went back to bed. 2 stars for good ambiance and memories, but for putting me out of commission for the remainder of a weekend, I really will never eat here again.",

Being on Mill ave will ensure a wild crowd, so do not intend to drop in for a quiet lunch or dinner, and the service had always been slow for us. In any case, still something interesting if you want a festive Taco Tuesday!",

    "text": "I've been to this Loco Patron a few times, but never longer than about 15 minutes.   Why am I giving a place 4 stars that I rushed out of so quickly?   This place is the perfect spot to grab a drink if you have to wait for the Light Rail when heading downtown. I don't live real close to a light rail stop, so when I use it, I get dropped off at the station right next to the place (like, RIGHT next to this place), and inevitably miss the train I wanted to catch and have to kill 15-20 minutes. That's when I stop in here and grab a marg or beer.  It's a pretty spacious bar & always looks clean. This last time I stopped in was during Happy Hour, and I honestly never realized how good a HH Loco has. I don't ever hang out on Mill, but I'll continue to stop in here for a drink when using Light rail to head downtown. Also, now that I know what they're HH is like I'll keep Loco in mind when I go out in Scottsdale (I'm assuming both locations have the same specials).",
