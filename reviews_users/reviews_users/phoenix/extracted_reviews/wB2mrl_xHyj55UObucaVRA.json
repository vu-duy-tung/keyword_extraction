    "text": "Everything was excellent!  My dad was in town from Chicago for the SOMA Lifetime Tri this past weekend. Needing a place for us to meet in the middle for brunch and something that wouldn't be so heavy since they were prepping for their race the next morning, I took to yelp to help guide me. Thank you yelpers for this great find!  The location is right off I10 west of 16th street on McDowell,  and a little seedy but you can tell it's up and coming... maybe! Don't let the neighborhood deter you from trying out this great spot.   The store is very bright and welcoming and so are all of the employees. We chose to sit outside on the back patio. They have an herb garden and nice patio tables. It was a great spot for brunch.  You order from the front and they bring the food to you. My dad's girlfriend ordered 3 of the small salads $2.50 each but all worth so much more. She ordered the arugula, the butternut squash, and one more I can't quite remember.  My favorite was the butternut squash salad.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and it was delish, no complaints.  My dad ordered the grilled cheese,  I tried it because he was raving about it and again very good. I love the mushroom and the cheese. I will order that when I come back.  Kids had the French Toast which were eaten up quickly.  There was not a delay in receiving our food, it came out quickly and the guys working here were super friendly and helpful.  The green tea was also very good.  The ingredients were fresh, this was a satisfying meal and I can't say enough good things, prices were very low as well especially for the quality of food you will get. We will be back for brunch!",

    "text": "I have traveled the US and the world quite a bit. As the son of a Frenchman, I can safely say that the greatest croissants in the world are in France. After dining at Ollie Vaughn's I'm happy to report to the yelp world that I can tell you where the best croissants outside of France can be consumed.   I really really like their French toast. It's excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a homemade French toast. But, Holy crap that breakfast sandwich is amazing.  It is an elite piece of art that belongs in a museum of breakfast sandwiches (which I assume would be in France)  This place is a small location that makes food from fresh ingredients, to order.  So understand when you come to eat here that this isn't Denny's where your food is almost ready to eat before you order it from their crappy corporate food-o-matic machine.   I hesitate to post this review, as I don't want to have to wait in a line around the building to eat here....but they do such amazing work, that they deserve to be that busy. Eat here, your tummy and your heart will be happy and thank you for it.",

Add to this Lindsey Magee's signature on the fresh and inventive kitchen, and you've got a hit.  On Thanksgiving morning, Lindsey opened for two hours to make sure those of us who forgot to order pies could gobble up some of her extras.

The people who work here are lovely, friendly, and helpful people. We came at breakfast time during the week, so they weren't busy. Their egg sandwich is a 'build your own' egg sandwich, which I love! You can chose between a croissant or a biscuit (I got a biscuit), chose your cheese, how you want the egg, what meat you want, and veg. I had an over medium egg on biscuit with roasted tomatoes, gruyere cheese, and bacon.... it wasn't as good as my fave breakfast sandwich (when that one is good), but it was a close second. Very tasty and fresh. The husband had the biscuits and gravy... he loved it. The gravy was exceptional, they really let the quality of the ingredients shine... and it tasted good on the egg sandwich (new creation? I think so...). Their coffee was also good, they get it from a local roaster in Glendale. We also tried their cinnamon buns later that night, and they were soft and tasty... not overly sweet like some cinnamon buns can be. Needless to say, I will definitely be back!  PS Their decor is SO cute and their patio looks amazing if it weren't a thousand degrees outside  PPS 950, woohoo!",

We usually go for breakfast and I get the french toast. It's probably the best french toast I've ever had, so if you're a french toast connoisseur, do yourself a favor and head over to this place.   They also have really good coffee. They recently got a new coffee machine and that thing is wondrous. They have tons of little pastries and such that are so hard to pass up when it's time to leave, so yes, you should help yourself to a cookie or an oatmeal cream pie. There's also a cute little patio in the back with a garden.  This is a wonderful little spot in Phoenix that you should definitely take time to visit. My only complaint is that they aren't open on Sundays! Crossing my fingers that that changes in the future!",

This is rare (from what I've found) due to the premium cost of the sauce but it will pay two-fold in harvesting a strong customer base and retention rate. I also had their biscuits and gravy with an egg on top and it too was delicious. I never finish an order of these but I definitely did this time. I can't wait to take visiting friends here too and love the fact that it's right down the street from home. Kudos to the staff and owners!",

After walking in we were greeted & asked if we were ready to order....ok so I guess we order at the counter. We were then told we coud sit at a table while we decided & come back up to order so we went to find seating, none available (we didn't even notice the outside area). I said to 2 different employees that it was our first time there which would have been a PERFECT time to mention we had to set our own table & bus our own dishes but nope! Breakfast was $40+ for 3 of us. As we waited for our food, we noticed everyone bussing their own tables & finally noticed we didn't have silverware. Thank goodness we didn't tip on our debit card since I had cash because really, what would I be tipping for exactly? The food was ok, agree with other reviews about the fruit compote.. it was a sliced strawberry... not exactly my definition of compote. The baked goods in the front looked delish but we won't be back",

I got the large chicken salad which was good, not amazing though. It also took a long time to come out considering there was no one else at the place.

I understand that many people enjoy it this way, but I felt like my teeth were going to fall out. The sammy, on the other hand, was delightful, and I can understand how it is so popular.  Come here when you have a bit of time to relax, or when working on homework. It's that sort of place. Ask for light syrup in your latte though...",

    "text": "I try and watch movies without reading reviews first. Netflix has a recommendation engine that analyzes and recommends videos based on previous watching history and ratings I submit. I have found Netlix's approach very effective at suggesting movies I enjoyed over the years. Here, on Yelp, I go to a restaurant based on an overall score which, in this case, is a human's opinion. But with over 200 reviews averaging out to 4.5 stars (as of this review posting) you tend to think there must be something going right here. Well, Yelp recommended Ollie Vaughn's as a Citizen Kane but I got The Room.  The location wasn't really where I had envisioned a cafe of higher caliber but hey, who am I to gauge gentrification? We entered the front door along a bustling Phoenix street into the quiet space in front of the counter where we selected our meals from the food offerings on their rather attractive menus. Prices were a tad higher than normal but this is quickly becoming the new normal in the area for these offerings. I hadn't yet noticed the decor or at least let it sink in but I did take note of the kitchen and its size compared to the rest of the dining space. It was a quite ambitious ratio. I wondered if this was an indication of a successful catering portion of their overall business. On to lunch.  I am a big fan of sandwiches so I chose the simple Turkey Club as the debut sandwich at Ollie Vaughn's. I like to do this for a set the bar on how someone can handle simple meals that also have lots of potential. I took a black tea for my beverage and we sat down in anticipation. What we received was lackluster in appearance. Sandwich, sliced in half, sandwich stickers to keep it in one piece. No pickle, greens, or something really savory like hand made chips. Alright, well, let's see what it tastes like. There was what tasted like a stewed tomato draped over a sparse allotment of avocado and lettuce on an ordinary tasting deli turkey between overly toasted sourdough. About three bites in this sandwich I determined to be \"okay\", much wanting for the price I paid. The black tea was black tea. My companions did mention their green tea was quite good, however. Perhaps I chose poorly on both fronts.  While munching on my \"okay\" sandwich is when I discovered the real looming disappointment; that decor I paid little mind on initial entrance to Ollie Vaughn's. Very white walls with an exposed ceiling structure above. While I appreciate a well executed exposed ceiling structure this was not it. I was suspect of water damage in the ceiling and them just removing the remaining ceiling element exposing the older not so gracefully aged wood beams underneath. The network of wires and conduit wasn't flattering either. Draw your eyes down and away from the upper portion of the establishment and we intersect with something more disheartening which is what Ollie Vaughn's deems as art placed on stark white walls. And not just art, but art on show for sale. We sat next to an unremarkable slightly paint spattered guitar set in a white shadowbox simply placed on the wall next to us. It was flanked by another similar white shadowbox filled with 3 different models of older Nintendo gaming controllers and a vintage film real, yes, in the same white shadowbox configuration. Prices? Guitar, $300. Nintendo controllers, $150. Film reel, I couldn't bring myself to look after the previous two offerings. The same plain white shadowbox presentation stretched around the whole dining area displaying a variety of mundane objects at exorbitant asking prices. One of the other diners in my group and I gazed at one particular item over the back entrance. We could tell it was a Ford Mustang grill in disrepair so we began the pricing speculation. $400? $500? We agreed $450 was probably asking price so I walked over to investigate. $750. I was speechless. The reason more being that there is a burgeoning art scene here in Phoenix, specifically in that area, that they could pull from. But rather than integrate a rich opportunity such as this, they chose to take what could ostensibly be considered junk, put it in a white shadowbox and proceed to display it for absurd prices in the name of art. It is an over the top pretentious move for an establishment who chooses to sell barely on par overpriced sandwiches in plastic baskets lined with wax paper.   I actually walked away from Ollie Vaughn's somewhat vexed. It was only on the way out of the restaurant did I notice the soft ambient electronic music which rounded out the grandiose hipster experience which had built up to that point. Thankfully I have options. There is Noble Eatery or Bertha's Cafe just down the road if I want a True artisanal meal. They don't try to be more than they are which is consistently notable food in a comfortable, non superficial environment. I'll pay extra for that.",

    "text": "My fiance and I were looking for a place to grab a quick eat before our drive back down to San Diego so after doing a few Yelp searches for lunch spots we decided on Ollie Vaughn's.    Don't be fooled by the exterior appearance of this cafe.  I was a bit hesitant considering I am not familiar with the Phoenix area.  I thought it looked a bit sketchy but I don't know I'm not from here!  I loved the mural on the side of the building in the parking area and the hair cut store next door looked quite trendy!  As soon as I stepped foot inside this cafe I was greeted by the friendly staff.  Their menu was simple a few sandwich and salad options and yummy baked goods in their glass case.    I ordered the chard grilled cheese which had rainbow chard, mushrooms, white cheddar & mozzarella. I added turkey to my sandwich and I had it on a brioche.  The fiance ordered a ham sandwich and a lavender iced tea. It doesn't stop there we also ordered a whoopie pie!  Portions were just enough for lunch and the sandwiches came with a little baked powdered sugar dusted cookie treat!  I really overindulged here but it was worth it.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious!  My sandwich was crispy ooooey gooooey!!  Yum!!!  I loved it and wanted more!  Prices were reasonable ranging from 7-8.50 for a sandwich.  10 for a sandwich and soup combo!  The ambience inside the cafe was very inviting....very vintage with the mason jars....loving the display of cookbooks which caught my attention Momofuku and Bouchon!  The outdoor patio dining area in the back with the herb garden and fruit trees was so cute and very great for the photo ops.  I overheard one of the other customers saying that the owner was going to change up the menu to use more ingredients from the garden for the upcoming spring menu.  Definitely recommend Ollie Vaughn's!!  Wish I lived closer but if I'm back in the Phoenix area I'll come back here for sure!",

Usually no issue getting a table evening during the lunch rush. Clients are white collars and hipsters and college crowd.  Food: Amazing! The breakfast sandwiches are served all day and allow you to pick your bread (biscuit, Croissant etc) protein (sausage, turkey etc) cheese (cheddar, gruyere etc) egg (scrambled etc). They offer an equally amazing lunch menu with artisan soups, salads and sandwiches. All include culinary forward touches i.e. Chicken sandwhich includes jicama, green chiles, arugula etc. Again with the lunch sandwiches you have the ability to choose bread type (sourdough, marbled rye etc)  Price: Pretty good considering the ingredients and taste, most sandwiches around 8 dollars.  Service: Sometimes a bit slow but par for course for kitchens that put a lot of care in what they produce.   Overall: A great foodie lunch spot!",

Then I watched this rough looking guy come in and he was looking at the pastries.  I think they thought he was homeless and they waited 3-4 minutes to even acknowledging him.  Very rude.    We ordered 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks for $23!!  The meatloaf sandwich was ok.  It was smothered with this sweet glaze.  The other sandwich was tuna fish which was way too sweet for my liking.    I agree with another reviewer that the staff is a little rude and dismissive.  I am not sure why they changed the menu.  They used to serve this AWESOME grilled cheese sandwich and a great roast beef sandwich.    The first time I visited this place was great.  Now, it's not that great.  Won't be going back.",

When leaving we walked by the bakery display, big mistake if you are trying to be good.  Had a cinnamon roll, FANTASTIC! Totally worth the calories.",

And it should be called Omie G's cause the food is amazing. I had the pork biscuit off the cashiers recomendation and was astounded by the flavor. The atmosphere and decore fit great and it was like stepping into another world from the rushing traffic outside. The quaint patio is cute and cozzy.The only complaint is the portion size was a little large and since it was so good i couldnt help myself from finishing it i am now a little beyond stuffed. Over all i cant wait to come back.",

    "text": "Was put off by the name so hadn't gone in before (thought it would be too hipsterish). And the atmosphere was definitely hip with super clean lines, glass table tops, under-stated designer artwork. But so many places are these days (I was hoping for something a little funkier). The outdoor patio was quite nice with a very pretty herb garden in handmade wooden containers. Both my partner and I ordered sandwiches and the bread was clearly stale. Very dried out (which the toasting did not disguise). Perhaps previously frozen or just more than day-old. The two extra sides we ordered were good - a green side salad (altho would have preferred the thick layer of dressing on the side) and a mozzarella and tomato salad. My meatloaf sandwich had way too much \"stuff\" on it though; I could not even taste the meatloaf. They put cole slaw steeped in dressing on the sandwich and then the meatloaf itself had a too sweet sauce on it as well. Good meatloaf stands alone. Some of these new cafes try too hard to make their product \"distinctive\" and might be more successful with letting a good, more traditional homemade recipe stand on its own. The prices are a bit steep for a sandwich ($ 8.00) especially, as noted by another reviewer, that's all you get. Some of the desserts looked good (key lime pie) but did not try them. Not sure I will be back; I didn't find the atmosphere very comfortable - which is more of a personal preference than any fault of theirs.",

I heard about it from some friends and was in need for a afternoon pick me up. So I pulled over and went in to get a cup of coffee.  I got a iced tattie and a Brownie. I drank the Tattie and shot the stuff with the young man at the counter. He was a character and had a great personality. We talked music and he easily up sold me on the brownie.  The coffee was no joke, got me good and fired up to go purchase those tires that I was originally set out on the mission to get in the first place. Since I was on my way to get new tires, the vibe of my afternoon was of the chore variety, and not of the kick back one. When I left Ollie Vaughn's , I was in a much better head space and was able to deal with having to perform the rest of my day with a much better outlook.  These are the type of experiences I take with me and remember when going to a new spot.  Oh yeah ! The Brownie was absolutely insane and gave my girlfriend and I both our chocolate fix for the day, \"we ate it later that evening\". I would recommend this place to anyone.",

On this lovely day in Phoenix, we chose to dine outside. The patio had the perfect balance of sun and shade, along with fruit trees and a selection of vegetables and herbs growing in the back. The perfect place to dine and enjoy a beautiful sunny day.   I opted for the chard grilled cheese sandwich with mushrooms on a toasted brioche, with a tasty bowl of soup, which made for the perfect lunch paring.  I also sampled the kale salad- the dressing was delicious, citrusy and crisp. There were also many tempting  deserts in the bakery case, unfortunately at this point I was stuffed. I can't wait to come back and sample some more of the sandwiches, soup, and salads- next time I'll save room for desert!",

The sandwiches are pretty good, and it seems like they change them up regularly. They have nice outdoor seating in back, and a really cool open kitchen inside.

It's cooked with green chilies and the pork melts in your mouth. I can't wait to go back for some more. My husband ordered a bacon egg cheese green chilies sandwich and it looked super good. I couldn't get past my own plate to try his haha. Can't wait to go back when we're in the area. Customer service is amazing as well! Thank you!",

My daughter had the Ricotta Pancakes and said they were the best pancakes she has ever had. That is high praise from a girl who eats a lot of waffles and pancakes.   The only downside happened when I spilled my water. No one behind the counter offered to help. Finally I asked for a rag, and the one they handed me can best be described as filthy, and that's being generous. It soaked up the water on my table and then I used some napkins but the floor remained wet and no one ever came out to mop it or wipe it during our visit.",

I love the coffee and tea drinks here as well, and the dirty chai is perfectly balanced (which is uncommon at many coffee places). I've had a few other baked goods and sandwiches here, which are also good, but I just keep coming back for the breakfast sandwich.  The service is pretty slow, but that's because they're making everything fresh and from scratch.   Unfortunately there have been multiple occasions where I can't find anywhere to sit. Last time I was here, there were no available tables inside, and the patio was way too hot (they don't have misters), so we had no choice but to run back to the counter after we'd already ordered, and tell them we had to take it to go because there wasn't seating available for us. Such a bummer because this place is adorable and nice to hang out at. I'm sure there's nothing they can do to help with indoor seating, but if they could put some misters outside, at least it would be a semi-comfortable option during the summer.  All this to say, I'm a big fan of Ollie Vaughn's food, drinks, and atmosphere. But I recommend either coming during a slower time, or being prepared to take your food to go!",

    "text": "I hope that this place turns out to be ahead of the curve with the location and more good food spots pop up in the area. That said, it is rough from the outside, with the front window right on McDowell Rd. Once inside, however, great things happen. The atmosphere is casual and hip. It is short order, with payment at the time of ordering. Staff has always been nothing but friendly to me.   Behind the front counter you can see them hand making all of the baked goods, which are delicious. The croissants are flaky and crispy just as they should be, and the biscuits are crumbly with a pleasing crunch on the outside. The green chile with biscuits and eggs is my go to. You get a very good sized breakfast made fresh from scratch for right around $10.   The back patio (back yard) is a unique and appealing feature. Step into the yard and instantly forget that McDowell Rd is 50 feet away.",

I saw this place out of the corner of my eye and made a U Turn in the street to go back and try it out. Definitely worth it. The biscuits in gravy is amazing but not heavy. The coffee was decent. I am picky with coffee however and just got a cold brew. They do have unlimited refills on coffee however which is gold. Where else will refill you if you stick around? The interior design is a typical gentrified cafe. I think what really sets this place apart is the back patio. It is magical. I don't like staying in coffee shops for long but could totally see doing so here",

I ordered a small chai latte and a breakfast sandwich (25% off with Yelp checkin). I like my egg fried over easy and added arugula, tomatoes, avocados and artichokes. It was pretty tasty, and I enjoyed my drink. It didn't have too much caffeine and sugar, which is a nice change from what I'm unfortunately used to. They've got nice selections for lunch too, so I may have to stop by again and try those. Glad I made it out here.",

    "text": "The Downtown Phoenix area has more than its fair share of great breakfast spots.  Matt's Big Breakfast, Vovomeena, Lo-Lo's, and Duza's Kitchen just to name a few.  There's also an abundance of great coffee houses such as Lola's, Be, JoBot, Fair Trade Cafe, and Giant.  Many attempt to be great at both breakfast and coffee, though I've discovered more than a few that sometimes don't put a strong enough emphasis on the food product versus the coffee.  Ollie Vaughn's is attempting the trifecta of being a coffee house, breakfast/lunch spot, and bakery.  No easy feat.  Lux Central comes to mind when I think of such places and my experience there was pretty decent.  So I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning, lured by the positive Yelp reviews.  The cafe is a fairly cute setup with an array of seating options both inside and out.  The interior has booths, bar seating near the front, as well as casual sit down tables.  One thing I should mention is the table seating has metal chairs.  After sitting down for awhile in my chair, it became a little uncomfortable.  A minor issue, sure, but if I'd wanted to hang out here for awhile, I probably would need to move around constantly.  The outdoor patio out back has additional table seating as well, bringing total capacity of this place to about 40-50 from what I could gather.  When you come in the front door, the bakery case is right there tempting you with everything from lemon bars, to cinnamon rolls, to oatmeal pies, and other tasty looking stuff.  Maybe next time, but this morning it was all about breakfast for me.  I decided to go with their breakfast sandwich (you get a 25% discount on it with a Yelp check-in) and their ricotta pancakes seemed like a crowd pleaser with Yelpers so I got those too.  Total cost including tax was about $15.  Food came out about 5-10 minutes later.  The breakfast sandwiches here are such that you can customize them yourself.  I went with a croissant for my bread (you have the option of biscuit as well), turkey for my meat (you can also go with bacon, ham or sausage), had my eggs scrambled (you can have the eggs done however you want), cheddar for my cheese (gruyere is your other option), and arugula for my veggie (there's at least a half dozen other veggies to choose from as well).  The ricotta pancakes are, well, pancakes made with ricotta.  Came with strawberries and maple syrup.  Oddly, the butter was already applied to the pancakes rather than on the side for me to apply myself.  I suppose it wasn't a big deal since these pancakes didn't really need more butter than was already applied.  Though I suspect most customers would probably want the option to apply butter or not, and how much of it.  Anyways, let's get to the food grades.  The breakfast sandwich was delicious.  Granted, it was customized by yours truly, but the croissant was light with just enough crunch and there was a generous portion of turkey, eggs, and cheese on this sandwich.  Solid breakfast sandwich all around.  As for the ricotta pancakes, I liked the fact that the texture of these pancakes were lighter and fluffier than most pancakes I've had and didn't require tons of butter to keep them moist.  That said, there really wasn't anything flavor wise that stood out to me.  Honestly you could've told me these were just normal pancakes made using a different cooking method and I would've totally believed you.  The ricotta flavor wasn't pronounced at all and aside from the syrup, I really didn't pick up much flavor in these period.  They weren't bad, just sorta bland.  The strawberries and syrup that came with it made up the difference, but the ricotta pancakes themselves weren't a standout item in my opinion.  The staff here was very friendly and it appeared there were quite a few regulars from the neighborhood conversing with the staff so you'll definitely come away feeling like you've entered a neighborhood haunt.  Perhaps next time I'll give the lunch menu and the bakery items a try.  As a breakfast spot though, I can't say it stood out in any real unique way for me.  But you might come away with a different verdict.  Hopefully I do too the next time I'm here.  Though I'll probably need to make sure I get a more comfortable chair.",

The coffee has been nothing short of delicious. I'm very picky about my coffee, being a barista for 5+ years. You can tell they pride their coffee quality as much as they do the art of making good food. I appriciate that in a restaurant. Customer Service rocks too! Forget your silverware? Don't worry,  they'll go back & grab it for ya! Always greeted with a smile at the door too. Music is a little louder, but still able to hold a conversation across the table. I have only been in when there is only about 2 other parties in the room though. They have a really cute patio space in the back. Even have a little play house in the back for kids. The best part are the citrus trees filled with fruit in the right season. Overall, I'm a new regular!",

The Hoisin Meatloaf was absolutely mouth watering, throw in some fresh local cabbage and that carrot and radish slaw and you got yourself one of the best sammies in the valley!!! I also had a few bites of the Tuna Salad sandwich. It was very good. The Jalapeno Marmalade made it sweeter than I'm used to, but still very scrumptious.

First, let's start with the well designed space, with a great soundtrack, and a friendly and laid back staff. I ordered the Cubano and my wife the tuna. The Cubano was one of the best I have had. It's hard to make a good Cubano. And they did it. My wife's sandwich, while looking simple without a bunch of fancy fillers, was so much more than simple. The flavors were unique and delicious. Two thumbs up. I hope this place keeps its charm and delicious food.",

This just wasn't the case with what I ordered: egg cheddar arugula and avocado on a croissant with hash browns and a large coffee. Everything was measly besides the coffee. The croissant was buttery and crispy and the cheese was good but it was all too small and I just couldn't justify the price. The hash browns weren't any more impressive- no larger than 1/4 cup and they were absent of flavor, really. I would say that if you're like me and want a big breakfast that makes you full and happy then there are other places nearby that are way more generous for the same price. That or maybe try something else here that's not a sandwich.  Other than that, I do really like the atmosphere of this place- nice and quaint. It's like Lux but more chill. They have a friendly staff that waves goodbye from the kitchen when you leave which is cool. I will probably come back for coffee and treats sometime which look yummy!",

    "text": "The food is a \"4\" but the service leaves a lot to be desired. The order process is very similar to fast casual places (order & pay first, then food brought to table). In addition to this, you are prompted to tip upfront. As another reviewer pointed out, how can I tip prematurely, without the service being provided? We are very mindful of people in the service industry & pre-tipped 15%.  Mind you, we are also not expecting to have the red carpet rolled out for us.   We had a simple order- two coffees, pancakes & biscuit/gravy @ 10:45 am and received our food at 11:40am. Keep in mind, this was after we inquired @11:30 for the status- all we got was \"your ticket is next\". We understand brunch can be hectic & food can take a bit longer to prepare- however, our issue is the fact that they didn't take onus, accountability or provide an explanation for the delay.  We were seated facing the kitchen and knowing that the biscuits/gravy were ready to serve (in a pot), we were dumbfounded that it took so long to cook the pancake batter.  There seemed to be a lack of prioritization with orders or maybe ours was placed on the back burner, pun intended.   To me, small business owners/management should be ensuring that all their customers have a pleasant experience & being oblivious to poor service is uncalled for.  At no point were we told the food will take longer than expected (at the time of order or while twiddling our thumbs while seated at our table).    For this foodie, it's not just about the food, it's the culmination of the overall service & experience.",

    "text": "Items Selected:  Ham and Gruyere Croissant Almond Croissant Ricotta Pancakes with Vermont Maple Syrup and Fruit Compote Carrot Cake Nutella Roll Pecan Bar Chocolate Croissant Pudding Chocolate Banana Walnut Bread  Continuing to show signs of a dining scene on the rise, several artisan bakeries moving step-in-step with flourishing Wineries and organic Produce grown in the northern part of the State, places like Ollie Vaughn's were virtually unheard of as little as four years ago, the high hipster quotient tolerable thanks to the good service and even more impressive products.  Small and easily passed by, signage along East McDowell Road blending into a background of street art and a disheveled gallery next door, parking is readily available in an adjacent lot with entrance immediately tempting patrons with baked goods, additions added throughout the day as the small restaurant transitions from Breakfast to Lunch.  Best described as a full-service Coffee Shop, the focus on well-sourced Beans and scratch-cooking evident even before perusing a small menu, it was with wide-eyes that a party of three perused glass cases and pedestals, a total of seven items from Quick-Breads to Viennoiserie selected and offered warm in addition to one made-to-order plate from the kitchen.  Locally owned and operated, the 7a-3p hours making Ollie Vaughn's an ideal workday stop for both downtown denizens and those on the outskirts, it was on intentionally mismatched plates that each selection was brought forth individually by a young man with big spacers, bright hair and pointed fingernails - all items presented with a brief description mere moments before tucking into the toasty Ham & Cheese Croissant as well an Almond version that were each chock-a-block full of bold flavors without compromising the shattering exterior integrity.  Receiving the plate of Pancakes more quickly than anticipated, a pillowy Ricotta base and Fruit Compote impressing even skeptics, more good bites were found in a coiled Nutella Roll that surprisingly allowed the spread to dry into a Brownie-like core at its center while the dark mound of Croissant Pudding was as moist, dense and rich as expected with Chocolate slightly melted by a quick rewarming trip to the oven.  Not particularly sold on the Carrot Cake, too much sweet and not enough spice beneath a dollop of Cream Cheese Frosting, both the Pecan Bar and Chocolate Banana Walnut Bread fared far better, the former going light on Brown Sugar filling while doubling-down on Nuts and a buttery Crust while the latter is weighty and well-advised for sharing even though pockets of Dark Chocolate Chips and bitter Walnuts ensure that no two bites are exactly the same.",

I love the biscuits and gravy at Ollie Vaughn's, however the French toast is always a good choice.  The french toast is thick, crispy, and fluffy light in the middle, just like French Toast should be.  On my next visit I plan on trying the \"build-your-own breakfast sandwich\" which are also made to order. You can choose between a croissant or a biscuit,  then you get to load it up with your choice of meat, cheese, and veggies.

I went with a friend, and we each had the American Breakfast (I know, boring), but it was perfectly cooked, large portions, and reasonably priced. The menu really is creative and expansive, so if we ever get there again, I will venture farther out of my breakfast comfort zone. We had traveled up from the Verde Valley for a medical appointment, so  referenced Yelp to find this fine restaurant. Go Yelp! You rarely let me down. Oh...forgot to mentoin the luscious appearing pastries in a glass case in the front. Yum! Go to Ollie Vaughn's! You won't regret it.",

Personally, their desserts aren't really my favorite, but that's ok with me. I really really wish they were open on Sundays.

My husband and I each ordered a sandwich and shared, so I had half the tuna sandwich and half the chicken salad sandwich.  The tuna was pretty tasty with a great jalapeno sauce to spice things up.  I wouldn't call the chicken salad sandwich a chicken salad, it was like thinly sliced deli meat piled up and had a couple pieces of jicama and a tomato.  It really needed some moisture and some seasoning because it was pretty bland.  I will say they do provide a generous amount of filling in each sandwich, so you weren't eating mostly bread with each bite.  I had black tea with blueberry, it really tasted off - I thought it tasted like detergent, but since my sandwich was dry I sipped it anyways.  When my husband brought back a glass of water it also had that detergent taste, that explains the problem with the tea.  Doesn't anyone else taste it?? Some filtered water for brewing the tea would make a world of difference. It seemed like a good deal of the other reviews were for breakfast items which I have not tried, so maybe that would make a difference, but for lunch I was not impressed enough to come back.",

The eggs taste like they're from farm raised chickens, the biscuits were definitely made from scratch but not heavy, the hash browns were seasoned and cooked to perfection (not overly cooked outside and undercooked inside), the French toast with maple syrup and compote (strawberry/pineapple) was so good, thick slices but light, and the chai was packed with spices and full of flavor. We most certainly will be back for the good quality and the ambiance was pleasant as well. The only downside was their Apple Pay wasn't working. I like using it when I can. But that would not at all deter me from this place or highly recommending others patron the business with regularity.",

Sadly after my most recent experience I won't be returning.  Friendly staff...not today; actually they always seem uninterested!  Great food...not today either.  Granted I think they use quality ingredients but it just doesn't translate visually or in taste.  Value...overpriced for the amount they serve you...as many others have mentioned in earlier reviews.   Hairnets, or lack there of...isn't that a health violation?  Who does that?  It's an open kitchen people....everyone can see what's going on in there.  Seriously, bearded guys preparing my food without a hair net is inexcusable not to mention the women and men without hats or hairnets slinging hash as well.  Time to check their inspection reports.  Heck, even Costco takes food preparation more seriously than this Mom & Pop place.  Pluses and there are some.  Ambience...it's hip and urban on the fringe of a really cool neighborhood.  Awesome patio...YES it's really as nice as everyone says it is.  Now if they could just improve on the important stuff - customer service, great tasting food and kitchen hygiene.  Sorry guys...I tried to love you and I wanted too so much.  But I just can't.",

The dish was supposed to come with a biscuit but they ran out so they offered to use a croissant instead, which I agreed to and it was still very good. The people were very nice, the space was clean, and the juice pretty good, too, although I finished my OJ in 15 minutes and didn't get my food until 10:45. The reason for giving it three stars was because the wait was unbearably long. Nearly an hour of just sitting at a table to get my food...I think the person who was in line behind me ended up just straight up leaving because of the wait.",

A good, flakey pie crust is a lost art these days, but OV comes through with a crust flakier than a politicians campaign promise. This pie was sweet without being cloying and had a taste pleasantly reminiscent of elementary school brown baggin it with yo PBJ.   Outside a baked goods, OV's delivers on great quality sandwiches and salads, priced more reasonably than most.",

I tried ordering a couple of different things, including one of their soups and a sandwich, but by this time, they already ran out. So I had to settle on a different sandwich and an iced tea. My friend and I's order took a while to come out even though we both just ordered simple sandwiches (the same exact kind) - about 25 minutes? For a cafe, and for it not being on rush hour, I thought this wait time was pretty outrageous. The food was mediocre and I didn't find anything special with the drink.  I can see myself returning here just for a quick coffee, but probably not for food or a bite.   Parking is on the side of the building, also facing McDowell St.",

The restaurant was quite inviting and the employee that greeted us was nice. We had to order at the counter and so we ordered a breakfast sandwich: scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar, arugula and avocado on a croissant. We also ordered the ricotta pancakes, a lavender green tea for myself and hubby ordered an iced vanilla latte.   I enjoyed my green tea and drank every drop, but my hubby couldn't even drink a fraction of the coffee and he's a coffee addict. He told me to try it and it tasted like watered down, barely any taste coffee- yuck. So that left a sour taste in our mouths as a start...  We get our food and I liked the sandwich- the croissant had a perfect crunch and we practically ate it in seconds. The ricotta pancakes were ok- they weren't bad, but nothing about the taste stood out to me.   Overall, I would come back. I'm just not sure if my hubby would join me since he was so upset that his coffee was so bad and he had to throw it away.",

The salads are super healthy and contain all a vegetable lovers favorite ingredients- kale, brussel sprouts, watermelon radishes, quinoa, etc. Sandwiches and soups are also healthy and really delicious, and every meal comes with a free little cookie or other sweet for dessert! Can't wait to try everything on the menu.    My only recommendation for the owners would be to get an espresso machine. Then I'll never have to go anywhere else.",

He has always been at the ready for whatever you need, and pays close attention to customer needs. I LOVE the food. Every time I try something new I fall in love.

I think for an $8 salad it needs to have more stuff in it that you can taste, besides the bacon.  Plus the container's only half full so it's like a cup and a half of salad that you get for $8.  I think I'll try some of their other offerings and update the review but I was sorely disappointed with the salad.",

    "text": "I visited last week for the first time. Found it here on yelp when I was looking for a nearby spot for some breakfast. It had very good reviews, so I tried it out. I prefer independent, mom and pop type places over the big chains.   I like the look and feel of the place--very hipster. I ordered the chili pork over a biscuit, topped with egg sunnyside up... I sat down and waited while they prepared my food. First thing I noticed was that everyone was involved in the kitchen area, as it was a small setup.. Only one person working there was wearing any kind of hair restraint. The main person doing most of the cooking was not wearing a cap or hairnet.. And, to top it off, no one was wearing gloves or washing their hands. I noticed the main cook go up to the cash register to wait on a customer, handle the person's money, then go right back to cooking without washing his hands. And he was directly handing raw food at the time.  To make matters worse, when my food arrived, the egg I had ordered sunnyside up had the yolk 3/4 cooked and it was sealed up tight like the egg was basted instead of sunnyside up.. The purpose of ordering a sunnyside up egg on a dish like this is to have the velvety yolk make a sauce of sorts on the dish.  I sent the store an online message thru their websites \"contact us\" link, but after one week,have heard nothing back. I believe everyone deserves a chance. No place is perfect and everyone has a bad day. But for them to have some GLARING health department issues and some basic cooking issues and not respond to a sincere guest letter with honest feedback says alot about the place..   I say Stay away if you value your safety",

Easy and super convenient as I go home most days for lunch - this right by my house. Food was ready at the time they indicated under the 'Order Now' option. I went with the Veggie sandwich on multi-grain and the Cuban sandwich on sourdough. The veggie was really tasty, the chickpea puree was the perfect 'meat,' and the multi-grain was chewy and delish. My other half had the Cuban, which I surprised him without telling him what it was - the man said he could eat them everyday and wanted to know why I hadn't introduced him to that place sooner!  We're both looking froward to trying the breakfast and coffee. I'm giving it five stars. Happy all around. Glad Ollie Vaughn's is in my neighborhood - we love to support our local businesses.",

It's cafe style; where you walk in, order, then can sit until your food is brought to you.   Long version: We absolutely loved this place. The service was spot on, the menu was super interesting with a variety of options that you would not completely expect from a coffee shop, but it is great. The atmosphere of the restaurant hits the nail on the head. It has a very cafe like feeling which is exactly what the goal was. There is also outdoor seating as well (110 degrees when we swung through so we opted to stay inside). When it came to the actual food, they cooked it spot on. I built my own sandwich upon my order which was pretty basic (eggs over easy, cheese, and sausage), but they nailed it when actually making the meal. It came out fairly quick; and it was perfect. My Ice Vanilla Latte was also spot on perfect too. In all, if you're in the area, highly recommend stopping by!",

    "text": "Ollie Vaughn's is a tiny breakfast/lunch joint that offers some mostly straightforward brunch food. And hey, it works. A simple menu with fair prices and well executed basics? I can't really complain.   Items such as ricotta pancakes, as well as a traditional American breakfast of eggs, bacon, and hash browns are all just fine. Their hash browns, in particular, have a nice crispy exterior and an interior that's almost creamy.  Their biscuits and gravy, a dish that I've felt few can actually get right, is actually one of the better versions you can find based on my experience. The biscuits are light and fluffy, with the gravy being equally as light and flavorful. This is a dish that I often avoid due to the heaviness it induces on the stomach, but I'd gladly order Ollie's biscuits and gravy a second or third time.   Coffee is also very good here. My girlfriend was quite pleased with both her latte (which was an accidental order), as well as their basic, traditional coffee.  There's an extensive offering of pastries here. More than you'd expect from such a tiny spot. I can't speak for their quality, but would definitely consider trying one on a return visit.  With so many breakfast options in Phoenix, including a list of established favorites, I'm not sure if I'd quite put Ollie Vaughn's into my regular brunch rotation. But this takes absolutely nothing away from their food, which is done quite well.   Recommended!",

There's a gravel lot next to it for parking, but once you walk in you're transported into a hip little spot. Indoor and outdoor seating, good music, and smallish but tasty menu with breakfast and lunch options. They also have some baked goods and coffee if you want to go that route.   The three of us ordered the tuna salad sandwich on sourdough, the American breakfast, a side of fruit, and the chicken salad sandwich on wheat. We were all super pleased with or picks. I had the tuna and it was one of the better tuna salad sandwiches I have ever had. They add jalapeno marmalade which gives it a twist that's tasty and not too hot of a kick. I highly recommend!  I would definitely come back if I was nearby. Service was friendly too.",

We ordered the coconut cream pie and and oatmeal cookie sandwich pie. The oatmeal cookie was incredible. I loved the overall flavor of this dessert and would totally order it again. The coconut cream pie was amazing as well. Really delicious coconut flavor from the cream and the whipped cream topping was really good as well. Cold brew was pretty good too. I would definitely come back for the desserts and I would also like to try some of their breakfast options too.",

It is a popular place so have been wanting to check it out. I was catching a show nearby and stopped in today. I think I will need to make a return trip to get a better feel for the place. The folks working here were very friendly. They have a small patio out back.   These are the items I had and what I thought of them;    A house Latte- good, I downed it pretty quickly! Yum!  Avocado toast- A bit bland and nothing to write home about but, hey, it is Avocado toast. lol- maybe some cilantro on top might help?  Side sausage Patty- this was so delish and cooked to perfection. Nice and juicy. Yummy!  Mexican Wedding cookie to go which was eaten after show. I was not expecting too much since they tend to be dry but I was pleasantly surprised. On the drive home late at night when I popped it into my mouth I realized It was pretty much to die for. Teehee. I was told they make all their treaties in house. They all looked great. They had a Raspberry Cheesecake on display, banana bread and a few other items that looked pretty darn good. The servings were large enough for two people which is how the Mexican cookie came to be my pick for today. So the conclusion is that I will just have to definitely come back to try more of their cakes, pies, and cookies, and of course bring friends.   The only thing that was a bit off for me is that they ran out of what I really wanted to try and they do not have diet coke/products here.",

It was warmed up and served perfectly. Coffee was great with mine being a cappuccino. Hubby had his little Italian cup with pinkie in air as he sipped. Outside dog friendly patio. Cool interior. They also do breakfast and lunch. A must try for any coffee lovers out there",

The coffee is smooth and served at a perfect drinking temperature. The layout is kind of an L shape going around the kitchen/coffee producing area. So think short and skinny with a few tables and around the corner to long and skinny with plenty of tables. They also have a fairly large outdoor space with shaded seating (shade is important in the desert). My preference is towards drip coffee which gives me confidence that they make a great latte or any other coffee based drink. I chose the almond pastry, she heated it for me, and it was awesome. Just sweet enough to handle the craving. Super friendly staff with a warm welcome. Can't wait to go back for breakfast!",

Between the two of us, there were three full meals (I also got a to-go order to have dinner at work.)  My lunch was the turkey sandwich on focaccia with stuffing, cranberry and bib lettuce, and a small spinach salad with lemon vinaigrette. Delish! Super fresh, perfect proportions and too much food! (I added the salad to my dinner bag - the sandwich was more than enough!) I also ordered a Mexican tea cookie, not realizing they were going to add a wonderful little chocolate peanut butter no bake cookie. Both were fantastic - and I was happy to have a friend there to share with!   Dinner was the flank steak sandwich on sourdough with the baby kale salad. Excellent quality, once again perfectly proportioned. I did eat both salads that night - and they were both absolutely fantastic. I also had the lemon bar on rosewater shortbread. Good thing I got a coworker to share that with me - I think I was already well over my calorie allotment for the day. And it was amazing!  Cute place, great back patio, excellent food. Not the cheapest sandwich in town - but given the quality, the value is definitely there.  The staff was all friendly, helpful and definitely made us feel welcome and valued.  Look forward to my next visit!",

Great place to check out - their pastries are super good.  Most times I'm in there and I can see them making it fresh.  The mixer is going and they're rolling out dough for stuff.  If I'm on my way home I sometimes grab one to go.",

I added a few things this time, and I have to say the roasted tomatoes and peppers really add a nice touch.  Also got a chai tea latte. Seriously this place can do no wrong, everything was ready when we got there and cooked perfectly!  Thank you Ollie Vaughn's :)",

    "text": "Word on the street is that Ollie Vaughn's is a keeper.  Word on the street is RIGHT!  I've never been to Lux myself, but have heard all the praise and was intrigued when I heard their former baker opened a lunch shop in the Coronado 'hood.  Always skeptical of salads and sandwich fare, I decided to give it try.  The hubby decided to work from home on my birthday so that we could spend the day together, even if he spent his time on calls or the computer (which is just better because we share a car and I didn't have to drive him to and from work!).  So, I asked to go to Ollie Vaughn's for birthday lunch.  Away we went.  Grilled cheese for him (on brioche), ham sandwich for me (marbled rye) and split a large spinach salad.  Lavender green teas for both.  Ham sandwich was ridiculously good.  I think I still regret handing over my other half to my husband.  I got his grilled cheese in exchange.  It was very good and grilled to perfection (crunchy on the outside, oh yes), but I couldn't get past the mushrooms.  He loved it, but it wasn't quite the grilled cheese for me.  Which is fine, I loved the ham and want to try ALL the other sandwiches.  Now I sit at home sipping tea and enjoying some of a chocolate chip cookie and pumpkin spice tea bread.  The tea bread is so yummy (moist, flavorful, out of this world good).  The cookie is ok, but I'm a choc chip cookie snob.  It's way better than your average choc chip cookie.  I wanted to eat all the baked goods in the case.  The strawberry cheesecake, apple pie, raspberry chocolate scone, almond croissant, etc.  I will certainly be back.    AND the service is wonderful!  They have cookbooks out too to browse which I loved.  An avid cook and baker, those are my preferred reading material.",

Looked like they have a nice outdoor patio but I didn't check it out.    Ordered the biscuits and gravy and was slightly disappointed by how milky the gravy was but I am guessing they had to quickly make more gravy or extend the little bit of gravy they had left.  Other than being too milky it had really good flavor and the biscuits were friggin fantastic!  It was a good amount of food too!    Took a bite of my daughters croissant and it was delish!  Real croissant flaky numminess, not the crap you get from grocery stores.    Had lots of other yummy looking sandwiches and treats and I will definitely be back!",

The sourdough seemed store bought, but the flavors on the sanwich were pretty good.  The presentation was terrible  - paper lined plastic baskets.  I also was tempted by the homemade oatmeal creampie cookies, but once again I was disappointed.  The cookies were in a cooler, and as a result the filling was rock hard.  It was also too buttery and made me feel like I ate an entire stick of butter.  They need to fill each cookie fresh as ordered and use approximately 1/2 as much filling.  I would also add a little more sweetness to fhe filling.  You should be able to pull apart the cookies or rip it in half, but the refrigeration prevents that.   The setting is nice, but the staff seemed overwhelmed for a reltively slow day.  There were only 2 parties there when we arrived. Right when we walked in the cashier told us that they could only take cards, but when we tried to use a card the machine froze.  He then said that we could pay in cash, which we did.  I also found the service to be very slow.  It took about 20 minutes for 2 cold sandwhiches.  I will probably go again, but it won't become part of my regular lunch rotation.",

    "text": "My partner and I had that certain hankering from breakfast fare and we found ourselves at Ollie Vaughn's. The location is central and a beautiful addition to an otherwise run down strip mall. The interior design is smart, a mix of industrial and farmhouse-chic. Overall the space is sunny and welcoming.  As we waited in line to order we began to drool over the luscious pastries on display. They have a nice selection of fresh baked specialities including moon pies, lemon tarts, giant turtle brownies and almond croissants. To share we ordered a colossal slice of carrot cake, a mini oatmeal moon pie, earl grey tea and lemon poppyseed ricotta pancakes (on the special board). The gentlemen who assisted us was very polite and attentive.   We were promptly served the tea and carrot cake. The tea was superbly spicy and paired well with the fluffy, creamy super sweet goodness of the carrot cake. Even though it was by no means busy there was quite a wait for the pancakes. When they were finally delivered it was well worth the wait! We got three giant pancakes covered with fresh fruit and butter. The flavor was out of this world! Very lemony and tangy. Definitely crave worthy! Also, we had to remind them about the the oatmeal moon pie we ordered as it appears it was forgotten. They made up for the delay/faux pas by offering up a delicious chocolate and peanut butter moon pie, a new recipe they were trying out, which was like a crunchy yet whipped peanut butter orgasm for the mouth.  Overall everything was super delicious and our experience was memorable. However, it all was only one note in a symphony of flavor potential. The pancakes would have been elevated with a savory, meaty side dish. Perfectly crispy side of bacon, anyone? I hope they expand their menu to include more items. Also, what's with the hours? Please stay open later so we can enjoy you more!",

I had some errands to run in Cen Pho and I really didn't want to totally derail my diet for lunch. So I did a yelp search for salads and this popped up. Imagine my delight to find all raving reviews! I headed over immediately.  I love the atmosphere. It's really cute and cozy, but a little industrial too with the concrete floors and counters. Love, love the teal chairs, white brick walls and fresh flowers.  Anyway, the service, while nice, was pretty aloof. And it wasn't busy so I don't know what the deal was. Perhaps they were busy making call in lunch orders that I was ignored?  I got a small spinach salad. For $4 I felt the portion was fair. However, my salad was supposed to come with Pomagranate and it didn't have it on there. I initially wanted to try the soup but they had run out (by noon?).  I got a Belgian waffle for my son. My salad came out (which took awhile), I finished it and we were still waiting on the waffle. I was trying to catch the eye of one of the employees because my son was really hungry, and he's 4 so he was about to go postal.  Finally a young girl asked of there was anything else, and I reminded her of the waffle and cookie we ordered. Her response was oh sorry that wasn't on the ticket (she was being polite not snarky - never know how that might come across in a review). But she was the one who took my order so I was confused as to how those items were left off the ticket.  Anyway, the waffle and cookie finally came out. They were really good. In fact, the food is really good and fresh. No doubt about that.  But my overall experience was just weird. In fact on the way out, a gentleman asked how was everything and I was like ok, food was good but it took a long time and the Pomagranate was left off my salad. His response, were there pomagranates supposed to be on your salad? I was like yeah all the ingredients of the salad are right here on the menu. He just shrugged his shoulders and said yeah it happens sometimes. He wasn't rude, but dismissive. Didn't apologize or anything.  As I walked out, one of the ladies was rolling out dough to make cinnamon rolls. They are probably delicious.   They seem like super nice people who serve good food. But they could use improvement on the customer service and efficiency.",

Minuses: The sandwiches we ordered were fine, but they were very small/thin for the price and came with no side, not even chips or a little piece of fruit or some such. The lemonade was so tart that it was actually uncomfortable to drink. It was pretty much straight lemon juice. We both had to wait until the ice melted and add more water and sugar in order to stomach it, so be forewarned!",

I came in around 10am and it took nearly 30 minutes for my sandwich to come out. So, the wait was not ideal, but I enjoyed everything else.",

The bacon in it was extra crispy which made for an awesome sandwich and paired great with the egg and cheese. I had to get a chocolate chip cookie too because they looked way too good, no surprise it was the best chocolate chip cookie I have had. So soft and flavorful the chocolate was amazing. Price was a little high but I'll definitely be back for those lemon bars and nutella rolls.",

    "text": "Totally unexpected awesome coffee/breakfast/lunch spot in the ghetto.  Stumbled across Ollie's while working across the street at the homeless youth drop-in center, and I was totally surprised to find that gentrification was happening even here. I mean, I understand that hipsters are into gentrification. It's what they do. And generally speaking I'm totally in favor of gentrification. But this is a truly decrepit part of the ghetto. Strip joints, homeless shelters, etc. Lots of hipster joints move onto the border of the ghetto, or into an area that's already been hipsterized. Ollie's has nerve to move onto McDowell and Food City, so props to them.  In the spirit of Ollie Vaughn's, here's my theory on the beautiful process of gentrification in the urban ecosystem:  1) A city starts 2) Everybody lives together 3) Industry springs up in the downtown area 4) Rich people don't want to live next to industry/poor people 5) --} suburbs 6) Downtown becomes \"ghetto\" 7) Low housing prices attract hipsters 8) Hipsters start Ollie Vaughn's 9) Poor people/hipsters coexist 10) Area becomes \"trendy\" thanks to Ollie Vaughn's 11) More hipsters 12) More trendy 13) MORE HIPSTERS 14) Hipster critical mass reached, housing prices skyrocket 15) Rich millennials move in from suburbs 16) ^ housing prices even more 17) Poor people can't afford housing 18) Poor people move to X suburb, where rich people used to live 19) Full gentrification achieved, hipsters mourn mecca 20) Repeat cycle in new poor neighborhood, starting at #7  The way I see it hipsters are like the gastrointestinal process. You start with something totally useless, like a $7 breakfast sandwich, after yelp check in, loaded with carmelized onions, arugula, tomatoes and bacon. An Ollie Vaughn breakfast sandwich. You're body doesn't know what to do with the sandwich. So you put it in your mouth and eat it. And like hipsters in the ghetto, your digestive process starts breaking down this delicious meal into things it can use. Bacon turns into a new protein molecule, maybe a gym in an abandoned warehouse. The croissant turns into a trendy new carbohydrate, maybe an upscale loft converted from a brick and mortar department store. The arugula turns into fiber, which, like the hipsters themselves, helps push all the poor byproduct out of this newly re-energized system so that it can go stink up some other neighborhood, ultimately serving as fertilizer for the next arugula plant to grow.  And they really do have good coffee, and their breakfast sandwiches are bomb, and occasionally they play rare old-timey Western tunes. So come here and eat, and maybe give a dime to the homeless dude in the parking lot while you can. He'll be gone soon enough, and this neighborhood will be bland once again, with only Ollie Vaughn's here to remind us of what was.  Pros: Delicious food, gentrification Cons: Poverty: coming to a neighborhood near you",

Another thing I observed while standing alongside the counter was that the guy cooking an egg, after he had cooked it he placed it on the white board adjacent to the grill. Shouldn't it go straight on the plate? I only say this because many different things are being cut on that white board.",

We split the two and it was the perfect amount of food, and at 11 bucks you can't beat it. The staff here is super awesome, always helpful and friendly, and the space is great. I would rank the patio as one of my favorites in town. The pastries also look delectable.   All in all, if you want a good breakfast or lunch, GO TO OLLIE VAUGHN'S!",

    "text": "My husband and I came by Sunday morning for a late breakfast. We live in the neighborhood and thought a visit to this place was long overdue. We were greeted by a friendly gal with a quick \"hi\" as soon as we entered but that was truly the extent of any and all pleasantries.  There was a couple at the counter that appeared to making a \"to go\" order (with a server/cashier that looked beyond annoyed at them) so we waited behind them as we didn't see any signage to seat ourselves or to wait to be seated. Since it was our first time there and not in a hurry, we waited. It took about 3 minutes for the couple in front of us to finish their order and pay and we realized when they said they were not taking their food to go that this was how you order your food; at the counter, pre-pay and then they bring you your food. It makes it a bit awkward having to decide at the counter what you want but since the couple before us took so long, we were ready with our order.   I ordered the brioche french toast with fruit compote and my husband ordered the ricotta pancakes. We paid using their app and I personally felt it was odd to \"pre tip\" on a meal for which we had not been served yet. I guess if you decide you want to order something else after you start eating, you have to go back up front, wait in line and tip again. We paid our bill and started looking for seating. It was a nice morning (and to be honest the music inside was too loud), so we opted to sit outside.   There was no music at all outside which again was odd.. it would have been nice to have been piped outside but at a much lower level. Our food came out about 10 minutes after we ordered it and I was disappointed that my \"fruit compote\" consisted of sliced strawberries. Yes, I was expecting an actual compote so if you are a restaurant and you put compote on your menu, expect to disappoint when you do not deliver. The brioche french toast was actually decent but I realized that neither one of us had utensils. I had to ask the server if he could bring them and he told me they were self serve and in the restaurant. I don't have a problem getting my own silverware, but again, it would have been nice to know that so I could have gotten them before I was served. It was kind of gross that the fresh silverware and napkins sit atop a metal cart with everyone's dirty plates and uneaten food piled up in plastic bins underneath the cart. Another thing I realized at this point is that I guess not only do we get our own silverware, we also bus our own table at the end of the meal. So what exactly is that tip for??  My husband liked the ricotta pancakes but thought they were a bit wet. He was expecting compote too, so we both felt a bit cheated.   To sum it up, this place has potential but it needs a lot in the way of signage, service and accurate descriptions of their menu offerings. Everyone with the exception of the first gal when we walked in had a chip on their shoulder, so we could do without the attitude. There is definite room to improve here but they have a long way to go.",

    "text": "Don't even think of stopping at rainbow donuts, not when this place is a block away.   So glad I spotted in in a whim (ok, the sign said pie, i couldn't resist).  The croissant pudding is yum.  Loved the oatmeal pie, its two oatmeal coolies with buttercream in the middle.  But the current winner for me is the ricotta pancakes.  They have a hint of lemon and poppyseeds.   The interior is light and airy.  Minimalist but comfy.  The staf is friendly, and took the time to chat with me when I came in.  Oh and free WiFi!",

    "text": "I made a stop in because I always see a friend post about this place. On my way home from work I decided to get my fiance and I a couple of breakfast sandwiches. The place is nice a little rustic with an outside eating area in the back. My order was done very quick and the girl in the front was very nice. I ordered two breakfast sandwiches one with bacon and the other with sausage. When I got home and took my first bite I was in heaven. You can tell these biscuits were made with a lot of love. Every bite was more and more delicious, I thought to myself why have I never tried this place before?considering it had been there for 4 years!!! I can't wait to go back and try more off this delicious menu (green chili pork).",

All very tasty, although I wish the sandwich had a balsamic type vinaigrette. Only small gripe is how long it takes for the food to come out, although you know it's fresh!",
