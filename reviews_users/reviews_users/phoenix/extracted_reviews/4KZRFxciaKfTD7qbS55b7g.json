It is one the best restaurants in Arizona. The food is the real deal. The ragu over parpadella is the best I have ever had. The homemade  ravioli is also the best I have had. It is family owned and operated. The pride and passion shows in everything they do.  Fabio thank you for doing what you do!!",

A small and intimate restaurant which caters to delightful aromas and delicious food from the bread served at seating to the wood fired pizza, fresh pasta menu, specials, and the use of decadent rich sauces. Listening to the service staff chat in Italian as they take care of thier guest adds a subtle comfort to the experience. The attention FIORELLA gives her guests far outpaces an already excellent staff and wraps the dining experience into a meal where the diner is treated like family and not a customer. Arrive early and enjoy the sights, sounds, and overwhelming aromas only good Italian food can create, and have Fiorella guide you through a great meal.",

    "text": "This was our second time here. We went on a Friday night, which was our first mistake. The waiter seemed rushed and forgot to tell us about all the specials. My wife ordered the fettuccine with lobster. She asked what kind of sauce it came in and was told a scampi sauce. It came in a cream sauce. She asked if it came with chunks of lobster, I saw one chunk and little pieces. For a pricey $40, it should of had chunks. We complained and after waiting awhile the waiter told us the owner was coming out. The sous chef came out Christopher who apologized and offered to make another one or since I was already finished, we had him take it off the check. He was very accommodating. Just wish the waiter knew his specials and how the food was prepared. In a review that I was emailed, I stated how disappointed we were with the waiter and meal, only to get a mean response from the manager calling us a liar and telling us we were video taped and could tell how much lobster was in my wife's meal. In addition we were told not to come back. That wasn't a problem, because I told my wife after the meal that was it for Fabio, we wouldn't be coming back. What an attitude by this manager!! On to other and better Italian restaurants!!",

Seemed genuinely glad that we were there, eating at (his?) restaurant. Super neat guy.  Wait: We were seated immediately and were served some bread while we waited. They promptly took or order, which took a little while to be prepared. However, the food was made to order, and we were not disappointed by the wait. (This is NOT Olive Garden speed.)  While we waited: Delicious handmade bread w/ oil and vinegar. We ate a bunch of this stuff, then bought a loaf to eat at home. They were not stingy with the bread, which was nice.  - - -  Dishes:  Butternut Squash Ravioli. Me. Rich, handmade pasta, creamy sauce. Not a giant portion, but very rich and delicious... the squash was sweet against the cheesy cream sauce. (You probably wouldn't want a giant bowl of this.) I'd eat this again.  Margarita Pizza. 15 year old son. Great crust, handmade sauce. Good stuff. Son enjoyed it. (I stole a piece.)  Bolognese. Wife. Tasty as well. Rich meat sauce. Nicely made pasta. Me and my wife shared this and my Ravioli, which paired together nicely. (I'd share like this again.)  - - -  Overall, we felt like family, had a great meal, and would go back here again. You should too, but get there early as it's not a large place.  Glad to have a place like this in Peoria.",

    "text": "I don't understand the hype about this place. Is it because the owner is there greeting everyone with an Italian accent to give an authentic feel? My wife and I went to Fabio on fire because we heard nothing but good things about the restaurant. So we stopped by and the place was a almost empty. The host quickly shoved us to the bar stating they didn't have any tables available. In the meantime I could not get over the fact that the restaurant was almost empty. I waved down who I think owns the place and asked if we could sit at a table and the owner noticed we were annoyed with our seating in which he decided to explain in a very condescending manner on how to make reservations and how I missed out on that opportunity. The night went quickly downhill from there. I just asked a simple question and in return I got an explanation of what I needed to do to get a table there as if it was my first time to a restaurant. I really got annoyed and I'll admit I did give him attitude and told him it's not my first time at a restaurant and to get to the point, which I understand was a bit harsh but that was a result if the owner being condescending towards me. My wife and I just bit the bullet and ordered the food thinking it's worth putting up with the owner because of all the good things we hear about this place. The owner got really awkward with us as if he could not handle the attitude I was giving him, if he was good at his job he would've been able to defuse the situation but he didn't. He kept getting in my wife's face and asking her what we wanted to order and forced us to listen to the specials. We all ordered pasta with the same meat sauce, pure laziness because all the dishes pretty much taste the same with no major changes other than the pasta itself. We had the bolognese meat sauce which paled in comparison to the meat sauce offered at The Parlor in central Phoenix, which blows this place out of the water. The owner again came by and asked my wife if we wanted deserts than looked at me and said with an attitude \"sweets\" as if I did not know what desserts are. At this point we quickly asked for the check so we can get out of that awkward situation.   TLTR: Don't show the owner you are annoyed because he will serve you a dish of condescending attitude.  Pasta is subpar and not worth the many stars compared to other Italian restaurants.   All I know is I won't give this place a second chance and I hope the owner reads this and realize to not treat customers like they are a child.",

The lasagna was very good, different than the usually kind we have, have more juicy meat pieces than tomato sauce, but it was just enough, and very good, it has less cheese between the layers than we expected, but it was perfect, Maybe that's how authentic lasagna should be? I don't know. We added some crushed red peppers on top too, which makes it taste even better. The butternut squash is very creamy, and tasty, it is the perfect combination with some prosciutto pieces. The portion size is great, it's not too much, and it's not too small, we were attracted by their dessert menu and decided to share a gelato. It was a strawberry flavored gelato. Oh my, that was that best gelato we both have ever tasted. Very fresh and you can taste strawberry in every single spoon. Would definitely come back! Great price too! The gelato only cost $2.95 (if I remember correctly)",

    "text": "I don't write many ratings and too often I feel that it is the negative ratings that people prefer to write as opposed to when they have had a good experience. I just left my 3rd visit there with my Wife and daughters and every experience is as good or better than the last.  That being said I had to write this rating... Let's start with the fact that I am Italian. Not \"eye-talian\" but italyn or for those from Italy, \"ee-taliano\".  The closer you are to pronouncing it as \"eye-talian\", the less you will understand the culture, the ambiance, the tempo and pace as well as the ingredients of an authentic Italian restaurant like this. I grew up in an Italian restaurant back in Chicago and spent 10 years working in this environment having performed every job in a restaurant form busboy, to cook to Manager and every job in between. Chicago has so many good Italian restaurants you can't throw a stone in any direction without hitting one. I hope that all that introduction says something when I tell you this place is authentic and excellent. I am not going to write about the excellent foods of which there are many and if you don't understand what authentic Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be like (slightly wet) you won't understand this pizza...  but I am going to tell you to come here with enough time, patience and love of food to appreciate what they are doing. Don't be in a rush, don't expect fast food or Olive Garden service... expect authentic people with love for what they do that treat you like family. That ingredients are of the highest quality mostly flown in from Italy.  Their attention to flavors is as realistic to my family experience as it gets. This is a real Italian restaurant with real Italian quality and attention and love of food. Don't rush this experience. If your glass in empty, take a breath, catch the waiter or waitress on the next pass through (it is a small place and easy to flag down your waiter) and sit and relax. Don't push this experience, Italians enjoy food as a way to spend time and enjoy friends and family not to wolf down food and get out to the next thing on your list. Once you figure out how to experience an Italian meal \"Italian style\" the quality of your experience will skyrocket as this is the core of the Italian culture.  Thank you Fabio for bringing this unique experience to the West valley.",

We got there early and were immediately seated, our drink order taken, and bread and olive oil delivered promptly. The menu is a bit anemic. I asked if they had chicken Parmesan-my favorite Italian meal, and the answer was no. I selected the lasagna. Good size portion, excellent sauce. My wife had the butternut squash- she loved it. I would have given 5 stars if the menu were more extensive. At the conclusion of the meal the restaurant was filling up. We will be back, hoping the menu grows as the popularity increases. A final thought - the bread is made on site and is wonderful. Try it, a good place run by good people. I prefer giving my business to the mom and pop, non chain, places. Their name is on the door and know their survival is the goodness of the meals they create. Fabio on Fire does not disappoint.",

The Butternut Squash Raviolis are tender with a hint of smokey prosciutto but the squash is amazingly sweet. The seafood spaghetti loaded with mussels and shrimp. Mussels were fresh and shrimp were tender. Red sauce was amazing on top of the fresh spaghetti noodles and nice change from the typical white wine sauce. Wood fired pizza which we didn't have this time but my wife had it her last visit and also amazing. Small seating but gives you that family style feel. Must say hello to Franco. Very passionate about serving you the best Italian in Peoria!",

We found it completely on a whim by looking at nearby restaurants as we left an event at our kids' school.  We were greeted by Fabio who took a moment to meet our family before we were seated.  Our waiter Rafael was charming and a lot of fun.  We really felt like we were family.   We had a delicious bottle of Italian wine at a reasonable price.  The burrata was the amazing (imported from Naples).  Our kids loved the wood fired cheese pizzas.  My wife had the braised short rib ravioli which was so good she wanted a second plate for dessert.  I enjoyed pasta marinara with mussels and shrimp which was among the best I have ever enjoyed in my travels. The Napoleon pastry and strawberry gelato were the proverbial icing on the cake.  Fresh food served by amazing people at a reasonable price.  Fabio even walked us out to thank us for visiting.  We will definitely return.  Highly recommended.",

When we checked in with the hostess, she was super nice and gave us menus to look at while we were waiting for our table. Before we were seated, Fabio (the owner) came over and introduced himself and thanked us for coming in. Now on to the food. We started with the Burrata and it was so light and refreshing. For entrees, we ordered the 4 cheese gnocchi and the Tarantina pizza. Gnocchi was light and fluffy and the pizza was probably the best in the valley. Very light and chewy, perfectly cooked. Tiramisu and cannolis for dessert and I hate to repeat myself, but the tiramisu was by far the best I've had. Cannot wait to go back.",

You could so easily drive past this place nestled in this little strip mall and miss out on an amazing experience.  Don't.  This is a DO NOT MISS. When you walk in, you're greeted immediately, and if you've put your name on the wait list, probably seated right away. Our server listed the verbal specials and then gave us a moment to get familiar with the menu and soak in the atmosphere. It reminded me of so many little restaurants I visited in Italy. We started with the roast pork belly special with hummus and a pear salad. Grabbed an excellent glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo and some enormous veal and beef tortelloni in an amazing fresh tomato sauce and a seafood spaghetti with shrimp and mussels in a slightly spicy version of that amazing tomato sauce.  Then we followed up with a sampler box of the amazing cookies and a scoop of peach gelato. The peach gelato was like a creamy, frozen fresh summer peach.   Now, this is very authentic service. Don't expect your server to live next to your table, but they will check up on you and keep your water full and take great care of you.   Go. Go. GO. GO!",

Two of us had the margherita pizza which barely had any sauce no tomato slices    tiny pieces of basil, and a few blobs of mozzarella cheese.  Very bland and not good.  The other gal had ravioli which she said wasn't too bad.  She didn't finish and opted not to take the rest home.  It cost $74 for the three of us and no one had alcohol. I did notice another table had salads that looked pretty good.  Made me wish I had ordered something else. I would NOT recommend this place.",

The hostess was very friendly and attentive to getting us seated.  We only waited about 15 minutes which is really good for a Saturday night around 730pm.  The waiter took about 10 minutes to arrive.  Again not bad considering how busy this place is.  My friend and I ordered the lobster and crab ravioli.  When the dish arrived, I was very surprised with the small portion, especially for a plate with a $25 dollar price tag.  Photo included.  The waiter dropped it off and dissapeared so fast that he didnt see the disappointment in our faces.  I thought it to be customary for the server to ask if you needed anything else before leaving your table.   So, I cut one of the ravioli in half.  I saw a fair amount of cheese inside but no lobster  or crab.  First bite lacked any seafood flavor at all, just cheese and overcooked pasta shell. I tried again with another shell, cheese, no seafood at all.  I tried one final time and again flavorless ravioli that was nothing close to what was described on the menu.  After sitting there in front of this disappointing dish the waiter arrived to see if everything was satisfactory.  I said this was a cheese ravioli that had none of the lobster or crab described on the menu and furthermore the portion was so small it was pathetic.  He asked what I wanted to do.  I said \"I don't want this\".  He took it away saying he would check with the boss.  He came back stating that he would take it off of our bill but didn't offer to get us something else.  Looking around I noticed most everyone was having pizza.  We paid for our drinks and left.  The positive reviews must be on their pizza.  I don't know if I will return unless we decide to try the pizza.",

The pizza with prosciutto was good, and very authentic, but I will say you really need to like prosciutto to enjoy that one. All of us preferred the white pizza. The bread with dipping oil was great, and the caprese appetizer was wonderful! It's a very family oriented place with service that makes you feel like you're a welcome addition. If you like True, authentic Italian food, this is the place for you! But I recommend you call ahead for a reservation, especially if you have a larger group.",

Everything is home made and only the best ingredients. The smell inside is AH-MAZING! with the wood fired pizza oven! This small family owned Italian Restaurant is a GEM!!

A friend told me she heard it was really good, so my husband and I decided to give it a shot. There are very few Italian restaurants in Arizona that are really good. Fabio on Fire is REALLY spectacular!!  We got there at 4:30 and were told the wait was about 15-20 minutes. We decided to sit at the counter since there were a couple empty chairs there. Actually a great decision, because we were able to chat with Fabio a bit while he was making pizza. We ordered the Bufalina and it was out of this world! The crust was perfectly charred and crisp yet tender, and the cheese, garlic, arugula and balsamic were fresh and delicious! Next came Lasagna and Lobster ravioli. Again, freshness that you can taste and the pastas are so tender! This is pasta the way it's meant to be! We only ate half of our food so we could try dessert. Classic cannoli and Lemon gelato....oh my!! I finally have a local spot that makes perfect cannoli! My heart is happy!!  Fabio's is officially our go to for great Italian food! A couple pointers-no reservations unless your party is 6 or more and this is a TINY restaurant so be prepared for a wait. But trust me on this one...it is more than worth the wait!!!",

There a couple of things to know before you go. The service is extremely charming and is very much a part if the experience, though it was a bit schizophrenic when we were there. Wine bottle was delivered to our table, but server didn't have a wine key, then server frantically gets food out for another table, then server returns with a wine key to find that the wine bottle has been taken by another server...and so on. This is really almost culinary theater, and it's fun if you're not in a rush. The wrong salad came out, but was quickly corrected, which was great because the strawberry salad is amazing! The food was really good overall, we didn't try the pizza, but will be back. There was another issue with which the staff sort of fumbled, but it's not worth detailing, as it really came down to inconsiderate customers more than anything else.

He made everything sound fantastic!!   The sauce on the lobster ravioli was very fishy. I couldnt eat more than a small bite. The pesto on the gnocchi was a tad bland.  The lamb was ok, but im not a huge fan of lamb so I shouldnt really critique it. I did enjoy the pizza with spicy salami.  I would DEFINTELY go back though and try different things on the menu as Rafael made the dining experience simply amazing. Felt like being at home with my Italian family. I even told the owner he needs a raise.  The prices were VERY reasonable but the portions are not very large. We were a party of 3 and ordered 3 entrees and one pizza and split everything.

Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals The house made bread is truly authentic Italian.... nice and crusty on the outside while soft and chewy inside!  My only issue with the food is that for the price,it should include a salad. Fabio needs to open a larger restaurant. The seating is crammed in there so you're really sitting on top of each other and end up having dinner with someone you don't know because the tables are pretty much right next to each other.  We would definitely go there a lot more often if there was more seating. If you haven't been, this is a must if you desire delicious Italian food, but don't mind being crammed in like sardines.",

As I also watched one other worker that was working on the floor just standing around not welcoming customers in, doing the least possible, She had a ear pod in her ear looking on her phone meanwhile their tables that I see looking around for more drinks / bread / checks. It was all simple tasks that any worker could've done so it doesn't matter what job position you have when you see your business getting busy that when you gotta start working harder. Thanks to Fiorella for showing off her hardworking skills such a great server !",

    "text": "We had heard great things about this restaurant and finally decided to give it a try. Well, let me tell you, we were missing out because it definitely lived up to the hype! The delicious food was complemented perfectly by the outstanding customer service and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Every member of the staff went out of their way to ensure we were served promptly and attended to our every need. Even on a busy Friday night! The owner was gracious and friendly, interacting with every table and making us laugh. They sang happy birthday in Italian to the table next to us and you could just see the enjoyment on their faces. Everyone was having a great time. And did I mention the wonderful food?! My husband and I started with an incredible appetizer and a bottle of Sangiovese. The appetizer was a generous portion of buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto, arugula, and tomatoes, drizzled with balsamic. It was one of the specials for the evening, but I hope we get the opportunity to have it again because, wow! Simply unforgettable. Next we shared the pear salad. It was light and crisp, with just a drizzle of lemon vinaigrette, so we could really taste the fresh ingredients. Next was the main course. If you like wood fired pizza, this is your place! So many to choose from! The made-from-scratch pastas and other entrees all sounded amazing too, but we decided on the pizza. I can't remember the name of it, but it was topped with black olives, prosciutto, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and mozzarella. We loved the combination of flavors and let me tell you, the sauce and crust were perfection! Maybe the best I've had anywhere. Last, but not least was dessert...yep, we really went for it. But I am so glad we did because we decided on a strawberry mille-feuille; light, flaky pastry layered with Chantilly cream and strawberries on top. It. Was. Heaven! I'm actually regretting sharing that one! The whole meal was wonderful from start to finish and I commend the owners for bringing this gem to the west valley. Exactly the kind of place we needed and one I'm more than happy to support. We will definitely be back soon and spread the word to all of our family and friends. Thank you again for a wonderful experience!",

Not only do you feel a sense of authentic, but it's also family oriented, great for date night, even a single lunch to visit.

The sauce is impeccable, it's cooked just right & it's the appropriate portion for complete bliss in your belly. The desserts-- there are so many to choose from!! I usually get an assortment of cookies just to take home. I'm ecstatic I can take my kids here & have a wonderful meal, in a warm atmosphere. Go try this excellent restaurant!",

    "text": "There's no denying the Italian legitimacy of Fabio on Fire. And in an area like Peoria, which is largely considered a culinary joke in comparison to Central Phoenix or Scottsdale, it's definitely a welcoming addition. I've dined at Fabio's on multiple occasions since they first opened, including their very first week of operation. I've watched their popularity rapidly grow to the point where I often question if this particular location is the best choice for what it is they're trying to accomplish.  I'll be honest here. On a good night, Fabio's pizza and pasta are easily comparable to some of the better Italian restaurants you can find in Phoenix. Their butternut squash ravioli, for example, is spectacular when done properly, putting most restaurant's take on the dish to complete shame. On a bad night, however, such as what happened to us recently, the dish was so overwhelming salty that neither myself nor my girlfriend had any desire to finish it.  Their pizzas are stellar and made in that traditional Neapolitan style that I've always preferred. The \"Best outside of Italy\" or \"Best in the U.S.\" Yelp claims are a bit far-fetched and eye-roll inducing, but for this particular area, it's easily one of the better choices you'll be able to find.  For dessert, they have excellent gelato, as well as a variety of Italian pastries and cookies that are on bakery-styled shelves. Nothing is labeled, but Fabio and company will explain everything if you ask. Some cookies I like more than others, but that's just personal preference. They're good when fresh, but suck when stale. I've experienced both.  What I think hurts Fabio's dining experience for customers, despite actually helping the business itself, is that the place was quickly outed to the locals to the point where Fabio's can quickly transform into a complete zoo when the joint gets slammed. The building isn't really set up well for a sit-down restaurant. Tables are all incredibly close together, servers can barely maneuver around, and it's not uncommon to go largely ignored for long periods of time. When moderately full, the coziness and intimacy works fine, but when large parties decide to dine here, it clogs up the restaurant and makes for a bit of a messy experience. Recently, my girlfriend and I checked in and were quoted 45 minutes for a table. The wait almost ended up being triple, yes, triple that time - clocking in at almost 2.5 hours! Granted, the absurdly large party of 20 diners might have had something to do with it, but when your estimates are off by that much, it might be time to rethink things.  Their whole iPad checkout process is very weird. One of the servers comes by and will simply swipe your card when you're ready to leave, without even giving you the opportunity to look at the actual bill. This is not really an ideal setup for a restaurant, as any billing mistakes will inevitably end up going unnoticed.   My feelings remain mixed. I'm glad that Fabio's is doing well, because their success might help other businesses and chefs realize that West Valley residents are begging for better restaurant options. But the lackluster service on busy nights quickly reveals why I feel that they still have a lot to learn about how to execute on a high level.   I'll be interested to see how Fabio evolves over time. But for now, I'd still give them a solid recommendation. Just hope that you're there on one of their \"good\" nights and you'll be fine.",

    "text": "This little Italian restaurant is the real deal folks. I almost don't want to talk about it because it'll get more crowded than it already is but I can't keep it a secret because that would be unfair.  The Capriocciosa pizza was amazing. It had San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, artichoke hearts, prosciutto, olives, basil, and EVOO (extra virgin olive oil). It's funny because I'm not a huge fan of artichoke anything unless it's in a dip and not the biggest fan of olives BUT I loved this pizza. The artichoke hearts were soft and velvety and so easy to eat. The olives were a perfect slightly salty type of delicious. I actually looked for them and ate them when they fell off my slices.   Next time I think I'll try the Tarantina which had the same first two ingredients but then had spicy salami, Gorgonzola, and white caramelized onions. I would've tried all 11 of them last night but couldn't fit it all in!   The veal meatball appetizer was so flavorful and served with freshly baked bread. They had fresh rosemary in a pot on the table so you can pick off the rosemary and sprinkle some in olive oil on your appetizer plate and salt it.   The ravioli is hand made daily every morning. Wait, I'm wrong. Every pasta dish is made this way. They sold out of the butternut squash ravioli so we had to settle for the veal and beef ravioli. Poor us, right? It was unbelievable. They also had a lobster ravioli available but my friend and guitar teacher, Pat, who had recommended the veal in such high regards. He is one of the most Italian people I know so we had to go with veal. Pat also recommends the eggplant entree but again, we'd have to try that next time.  Our waitress Fiorella was one of the sweetest, warmest people I've ever met. She was personable and made us laugh and when she spoke in Italian with other staff members, it really did feel like I was invited to a family dinner in Italy. When I was eating that amazing looking and tasting pistachio cannoli, she said, \"I'm not going to tell you how to eat it, but you should just use your hands,\" and gave us no forks for the cannoli. She is the best!   They have a smorgasbord of Italian pastries. You can get a box and just pick and choose an assortment of what you like. Everyone seemed to after they finished their dinners. We were the only ones that didn't since we just ate that huge cannoli.  Like any awesome restaurant, it's busiest on weekends and the service may be a bit slower. During the week, like on a Tuesday, it's just perfect our waitress said. It's not super fancy or anything but you definitely feel like you're getting a fabulous home cooked authentic Italian meal and experience when you come here. You'd think the pizzas would be the stand out but the pasta may be the real standout. You decide!!",

    "text": "Excellent visit on a Sunday lunch.  No crowds at all!  This is a small venue and I can see how it may get a bit noisy when bustling, but our \"off peak\" hours timing was perfect.    I shared the Butternut Ravioli and Pear Salad with my Mom.  The ravioli was AMAZING as many others have also stated, so definitely give it a try.  The pear salad, served with a lemon vinaigrette, was a bit plain on the dressing.  (Personally, I'd prefer to see a bit more lemon juice and zest, and perhaps a dash of white pepper, to spruce it up more, as it was very mild.)  The greens were fresh and the pear perfectly ripe, so the produce was not at fault.  Because of that, I wouldn't hesitate to try a different salad next time.  I prefer strong flavors and spice; so if your preferences lean mild it might be something you like.   Another person in our party had a sandwich, which was huge, and he liked it but I didn't try as I was too stuffed to take another bite, so I am not able to review that.  He was unable to finish it all and had a huge portion to take home.  Regretfully, I also didn't have room to try dessert.  Our server was terrific, totally flawless.  Warm and knowledgeable.  She was great.    I think this is a nice place to try if you're a bit tired of chain restaurants and looking for a fresh Italian menu to try.   I think next time I might share a pizza, in an attempt to save room to sample the tiramisu.  They are only open for lunch on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday but check it out for that if you're in the area those days.  (Especially if you want to avoid crowds and enjoy a quiet visit, our server told us Saturday night was very busy!)",

    "text": "This is a great place to casually dine on the West Side. We've ordered for pick up, Door Dashed and dined in early on a Friday evening. Service is slow but the food is great. I love that there are gluten free options for pizza. Best gluten free crust I've ever had. Ever. Bubbles up like a crust should. The produce is fresh and I'm glad Fabio supports local.   When we dined in, my daughter had the butternut squash ravioli which was to die for. Portions were large enough to share. My husband had the lobster ravioli, which was ok as the portion size left him still hungry. Bread was ok. Food came out promptly after we ordered but we had issues with the hostess. She sat us inside when we asked to be seated outside and never brought us our menus. I saw the hostess bussing tables and touching dirty dishes then passing out water. It was a zoo. I'm sure this happens elsewhere.   We've had the Diavola pizza and sausage and fungi pizza-both excellent and satisfying. We have also indulged in the cookies which were pretty good. The strawberry gelato was refreshing and delicious.   Quality of food makes up for the hospitality that still needs to be ironed out.",

Coming from an Italian family from NYC, i am a bit skeptical of Italian dining.  Wow were we pleasantly surprised.  One of the best places I know, and thier deserts may be even better than the main course.  The strawberry gelato was enough to come back for on its own.  Now to the service.  Nothing short of perfect. They work together as a team and my table was never in want for anything.",

Fiorella reviewed the entire menu with us and made suggestions going into great description.  She was so helpful and accommodating.  She served with a smile that would light up any room.

However, this review is about a catered event that Fabio did for our family last Saturday.  We had more than 60 friends and family to our home to celebrate a special family event.  Fabio brought his wood-fired pizza oven to our home and served made-to-order pizza, fresh salad, and bruschetta.  Our friends loved having a chance to see how their pizza was made and Fabio did not disappoint.  He and his team were fantastic!  They interacted with everyone at our party and made everyone feel special.  In fact, our guests were so entranced that many of them spent much of their time at the pizza oven in our driveway watching Fabio make pizza!  The pizzas were great and obviously very fresh and the salad and bruschetta were as good as what you are served at Fabio on Fire.  If you ever need to feed a large number of party guests, give Fabio a call and have him bring his wood fired pizza oven to your home!  It was great fun!",

Every entree we've tried has been so delicious, maybe the ravioli is our favorite? The best tiramisu ever and they give little cookies to our grandchildren. Just ate there last night and can't wait to go back next week. Never disappoints! Fabio has an amazing story, if you can get him to stop working so hard. Love him, his mom and the whole staff.

This restaurant could compete with some of the best neighborhood Italian restaurants in the country.  I went with a couple of friends and we got a few things to share.   The pasta is freshly made ... and you can tell. Excellent quality. We also got a couple of appetizers.  The tomato with burrata was amazing. Also, had the meatballs in a marinara sauce. It too was really good.   We shared a pizza too which had such quality ingredients and a fantastic taste.   The meal was finished with a canoli.    I'm from Chicago. My mother is Sicilian.  I feel confident that I know great Italian food and this is it.  Nothing pretentious,  very casual and neighborhoody.  Fabio himself is making pizzas and greeting customers with his broad grin and wonderfully inviting Italian accent.   This is what dining out should be. Quality, fresh, reasonably priced and so welcoming.",

Not extreme though, and it was worth the wait. Their pizza menu is more extensive than their pasta menu, with only 4 or 5 pasta dishes listed, but everything we had was delicious, from the strawberry salad, Bianca Parma pizza (white pizza), lasagna and butternut ravioli, to the cannoli. My only suggestion would that they serve some olive oil & balsamic vinegar for dipping with the delicious bread they put on the table when you're seated.",

We usually don't go for Italian anyplace except Tomaso's but I had heard good things about Fabio on Fire and it is much closer to our house.  We were not disappointed!  We started with the meat and cheese appetizer platter which was scrumptious, along with the bread they bring. We all had different main meals and we all sampled each other's. My butternut squash ravioli was amazing. My son ate every bit of his beef short rib ravioli, my husband had sausage and broccolini ravioli, our daughter-in-law the tagliatelle bolognase, and our grandson the kids pepperoni pizza. Not one of us said we wouldn't order our meals again. For dessert we tried the cannoli, tiramisu, and a strawberry and a chocolate gelato, and we just passed them all around and made mmmmm, so good noises. We are already planning our next visit!",

    "text": "Very good hidden gem in a strip mall which is too bad because the food is above that location. The butternut squash ravioli was really good as was the crusty bread and wine. My friend had the lobster special but there was very little lobster in it. I must say though that make sure you stand you ground and eat at your leisure and don't let them rush you. It is very small and you can make a reservation on their site to get an approximate time. I think a nice Italian restaurant should reflect the family like feeling of wanting to stay and enjoy the food. We wanted to enjoy our dinner but our waiter actually handed my friend a to go box before she even asked for one. After we ordered dessert, we could feel him hovering around us so he could give us the check. They check you out at the table which also isn't very classy. My friend wanted to pay in cash and when he said how much tip she said a number, 20%, and he said well then that would be $9 not $8. He then asked if she wanted change! She would have gotten money back but she felt so flustered she said no. If someone is going to put out high end food then make the atmosphere and the servers reflect it. I would only order to go.",

The person seating us (not the owner)  noticed my husband was a little annoyed when we were sat at the bar. The man seating us in a very condescending manor explained to my husband how reservations worked. Unbelievable. Then he stood at the bar in front of me so he could hear what we were saying. I don't know if he was in a horrible mood that day but he was very aggressive and just condescending. He clearly did not like my husband. So we were like okay.. maybe the food will be great. Man what a disappointment the food was wow. It was just BLAND. We've been to Italy, we've been to other Italian restaurants and so far we've never had food this tasteless. He was condescending the entire night, treating my husband like complete crap. He turns to me and says, \"ma'am, would you like some dessert?\" Then turns to my husband as if he doesn't know what dessert is and says, \"sweets.\" Definitely not coming back here. You want good Italian food? Probably go anywhere else but here and make sure that condescending man doesn't think you're upset because he will berate you the entire night. They need to FIRE that guy.",

Quiet, clean and comfortable although one person in our party switched from hard wood chair to an upholstered one. In all we had butternut ravioli, lobster and crab ravioli, antipasto plate, pear/arugula salad. ALL were delicious! The bread basket was filled twice we enjoyed it so much!!  This is definitely a \"go back to\" place!",

    "text": "This is going to be a long review, so please grab a seat!  We have been HUGE fans of Fabio ever since meeting him in 2013. We were very fortunate to have him cook for us in our home, spinning pizzas and baking his delicious biscotti. We fell in love with his amazing bread, and have never been the same!  When we heard Fabio was opening a restaurant we were \"over the moon\".  Tonight we celebrated a special birthday and Fabio and his family at \"Fabio on Fire\" made it extra special.  For our first course we ordered the \"grande\" appetizer platter. Many different cheeses and meats with olives and grapes and that delicious bread. Be careful, you'll want to devour every morsel, and like me, may decide to order an extra serving of my favorite cheese, pecorino peppercorn.  Note: I've searched for this cheese for many years ... so to find it served on the cheese platter tonight, I was overjoyed.  Since there were 7 of us, I won't detail every dish, but two of the highlights were: the bolognese lasagna and the artichoke & prosciutto pizza. I could only eat 1 slice as I knew I had to leave room for dessert.  OMG ... Fabio's homemade gelato, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry and his limoncello sorbet. I defy you to find a better tasting gelato in the entire country. In fact, I know a thing or two about gelato, haven eaten it 3 times per day when I was in Rome (that's 7 days x 3 = 21 servings of gelato) and I can truly say Fabio's gelato is THE best!  My partner is a purist and only eats vanilla gelato, but I like to live \"dangerously\" by eating chocolate and strawberry together in the same bowl. Vivevla difference! LOL  One spoonful and you will flip out on the unbelievable fresh taste of Fabio's gelato! Then there's his Italian pastries. Too many to list, but I'm going with my favorite: pistachio cannoli.   In short, visit Fabio on Fire soon ... before everyone discovers it and you won't be able to get a reservation. Your taste buds will thank you!",

It was a rainy day so they lit the propane  tower heaters to create a warm, cozy atmosphere.  The chairs have large, comfortable seats with pretty, fabric tie on cushions. A nice touch. Nice music playing.   Beautiful food with only the best ingredients.  This is authentic Italian fare. Seafood, lamb, pasta....Nice wines, unique dessert, everything was delicious!  I am gf, df, nightshade free! An allergy nightmare! And they accomodated me with the most exquisite pizza I have ever had the pleasure of dining upon.  The crust was thin, crisp and PERFECT.  The toppings --  there are no words. Absolutely above and beyond.  It was one of those experiences that has you living completely in the moment, savoring each bite. If you want to be carried away to Italy for an evening, this is the place!  Show up early. In general they do not take reservations.",

The cavatelli with brocolli and sausage also top notch.  Pizza and gnocchi also cooked to perfection.  PIzza is the closest to actual Napoledean pizza we have had in AZ.   Nice little Italian wine list and priced appropriately.    There is nothing close to this type of food in Glendale/Peoria let alone all of AZ.  Thank you Fabio and staff for a wonderful evening.

I still think that was bad business and I was annoyed I drove that far away. However, I am so glad I changed my mind and stopped by today. I happen to be in the neighborhood though.  Holy heck in a hand basket, this place is freaking unbelievable! Easily the best place I have eaten at in Phx for wood fire style pizza. The owner chatted with me while I sat at the bar. The staff were amazing in the way they treated me. ( as if I was family) The bread they serve as an app is crazy good and the pizza is the best wood Fire, Artisan style pizza I have had here in Az. Finally,  the Tiramisu is incredible.   The only bad thing is the place is way too small, loud, and very cramped. I ate at the bar which was a tad better but I usually dislike bar service for dinner. However, it was not that bad. The tables are very close to each other and the place does not have many tables. It must be a nightmare to serve here. Maybe they will expand one day?  Fabio, it was a pleasure meeting and chatting with you. Your staff members are kind and friendly and your food is amazing! Thank you for an amazing experience.",

Sitting at the pizza bar is the way to go.  Employees were amazing, friendly and in a joyous mood. I haven't even got to the food yet.  Wife had a beautiful white pizza and I got the spaghetti special that had mussels and shrimp.  It truly was DELICIOUS.",

My husband asking the server about what beer they have after telling him, the server walked out. He announced on the table that the tip should be 20%, we don't want to give him 20% coz he was terrible. Never ever going back to this place again. I was so excited for my co-workers to try this place coz i think it's a gem but not recommending this place at all. Terrible service and rude server.",

The lamb was cooked beautifully, full of juicy flavorful perfection. And the gnocchi was so creamy and savory.   We also ordered tiramisu and a cannoli. WOW. Amazingly fresh and not over powering with sweetness. Definitely recommend them.   The hostess and servers were all polite and made it a cozy family atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back!",

The people we sat next to traveled from Paradise Valley to eat. Family owned by a family from Milan that speak Italian to the wait staff.   We had a party of three and ordered the following:   Rib ravioli  Lasagna  Lobster pasta   All three were amazing in their own way. The ravioli and lasagna was the best I've had in a long time. The Lobster pasta wasn't my favorite but for those that love hardly any or light sauce, this is perfect for you. Everything is served at warm or room temperature so if you like it piping hot, make sure you ask for it in advance.   The owner pulled out my seat for me and makes you feel like family and speaks to you just the same. So if you're looking for fake service, go elsewhere.  The wine is all Italian and the Italian beer was great! We went at 820 and the place was still packed. Word of advice is to put yourself on their waiting list so that you're guaranteed a seat. Such a gem in North Peoria and break from all the chain restaurants.",

This a small bustling place with an open kitchen and a great pastry display case. They have a wonderful selection of imported Italian wines and we got one from the Abruzzi region of Italy which was a very good, flavorful red and not too dry. The bread basket of Fabio's wonderful Italian bread is complimentary on the table and is so very good especially dipped in the olive oil and balsamic dressing that is on the table. My husband and I split the caprese salad which had fresh tomatoes and mozzarella cheese and a light topping of olive oil and a balsamic reduction. This time I opted for the bianca parma pizza with prosciutto, arugula and parmesan with a light amount of olive oil. It was so large I took two slices home. My husband had the pounded thin breaded veal chop and it was very tasty. Our friends had the gnocchi and lamb chops and they loved theirs. For dessert we had the Napoleon with it thin crispy layers between sweetened whipped cream so very decadent along with espresso. The espresso here is one of the few places in the valley that knows how to make real authentic Italian espresso. We will return.",

We are both Italian and for us to say this next line means a lot. This was the best Italian food we have ever had. The lasagna was a huge portion and I normally eat everything on my plate but I just couldn't. I tried my wife's gnocchi and I couldn't believe how good it was. We are especially blessed because this place is hidden behind the QT and Wells Fargo at 83rd Ave and Lake Pleasant Pkwy, which is close to home.

Anyway, it's really difficult to find a non-corporate restaurant in Peoria, yet here sits this gem! The couple who owns it are from Italy! The recipes are authentic and delicious! I had the butternut squash ravioli. You could tell the noodles were homemade, the sauce was rich and creamy, and the pancetta added a nice savory touch. I want to try other foods there, but I am seriously craving that pasta already! My husband had lobster ravioli, which he said was superb (I don't eat seafood). The kids had a cheese pizza and Kids pasta, and ate every last bite! The bread, pizza dough, and noodles are all house made. They also have a nice dessert menu, which includes Italian cookies!I can't wait to go back! An amazing find in Peoria!",

    "text": "Super disappointed in this restaurant, especially with all the great reviews I read prior to making plans here for my mother's birthday. Went on a Saturday night with a party of 6 plus 2 kids and thank goodness we made a reservation. The place is cramped and you are constantly being bumped into by other guests or servers. Our waiter was great and attentive but I didn't like that we were only told the amount our bill was so he could run my card on an iPad and not given an opportunity to actually look at the bill. Sometimes accidents happen and I like to ensure my bill is only what I ordered but I was not able to do that. For our party we paid $150 without tip which is crazy expensive for what we got.  2 of us had the eggplant parm and were both disappointed. It was bland and boring, and I'm missing the \"parm\" aspect as it has no breading and no cheese. Also for the price, it didn't come with a side of pasta or anything so we simply had a plate of eggplant and sauce.  Another person had a pear salad with lemon vinaigrette dressing that was no more than olive oil on arugula. Also bland and boring.  Another person had the lasagna. Large portion, great tasting homemade noodles but so little sauce it was dry.  The short rib ravioli had meat tasted well done but the cheese sauce was tasty.  One person had the spinach ravioli with a walnut cream sauce and absolutely loved it. The cheese sauce was flavorful and not overwhelmingly heavy.  To end dinner, the tiramisu was outstanding. It'd prob be the only thing worth returning for.",

    "text": "Oh so sorry to write this review. I have heard only good things about this new addition to the westside so my husband and I were truly looking forward to trying it. Just so disappointing........ Since it was a Saturday night I did use the waitlist app located on their website. It worked very well. Restaurant is an extremely small bistro but cute.  We were greeted by a young gal in ripped beans , which I know is fashionable, but not appropriate for a hostess. We were given menus and as we glanced at them I have to admit it was not the easiest to decipher. I adore Italian food and have been in many Italian restaurant in the valley( and I am truly not including the Olive Garden type)... so although I understood most choices on the menu I watched as tables next to us could not figure out what they were to order. Our waiter was very charming but rushed thru choices and since his lovely Italian accent was very thick , understanding our choices was not made any easier. Again, I watched others at the next table looking inquisitively at him also. Anyways, I made the choices of a glass of Chainti, an antipasto, lasagna with bolognese sauce and a wood fired  pizza with prosciutto -we had heard so much about. We sat back to enjoy our dinner and wham......the place got mobbed.  A basket of three slices of cold bread and small serving of olive oil and balsamic was placed on our table. Everyone seemed to be running around and service went down the drain. Our antipasto, which was a charcuterie board of lovely meats and cheeses was placed on our table by a young man who you could tell really did not want to be working. By this time the three small pieces of bread were gone so we had to ask for bread to put our meats and cheeses on. Although it was very appetizing the atmosphere of people being seated, menus trying to be explained, and no place for those waiting to wait, spoiled the appetizer. We were about a third thru this platter when our lasagna and pizza was brought to the table. Very very poor timing. We sent the entrees back so we could finish our appetizer but feeling rushed asked for a box to take the rest of our antipasto home. The young man who did not want to be there gave us a box.....and then he never brought back the entrees. We flagged down the main waiter and he explained since we sent it back it had to be replated. Sorry- not a good answer. Had to flag down waiter for water, never asked if I wanted another glass of wine  but finally our entrees came. Had to ask for parmesan cheese and red pepper. Hostess brought it.  The pizza as fair. We love wood fired pizza but dough had no taste and toppings \" just ok\". The lasagne was different...lasagne pasta with bolognese sauce over the top. Sauce was very bland and homemade pasta was mushy. By this time the noise level was so high and since our table was near the door it was so crowded we could not wait to go. We had been looking forward to a cannoli for desert but actually just wanted to leave. Although Fabio was not there the head chef( I think)  did come over and asked how we liked our dinner. We were honest with him. He thanked us for our comments but that was it.  Out $70 ......I really wanted to love this place.........will not be back",

    "text": "Based on the reviews, I expected great things. The food was very good. Compared to the competition you won't be disappointed. Great value. Fantastic desserts! I got the diplomat (Italian for a Napoleon, basically.) Get that if you go.   A four star review for three things:  1. Poor wine list, three choices of red. 2. Uncomfortable, cramped tables very close together. Loud, no sound damping. Bad light, reminded me of lights you'd see in a Mc Donald's. They could do a lot of romancing the place for not very much money. 3. We got a pizza to split for two of us. The center of the crust was soggy.   Those three points aside, I really enjoyed myself. I will go back. Maybe during the day, and sit on the patio.  This is just not the place to go if you want ambiance.  Prices are very fair, and food quality is excellent (save the soggy pizza crust).",

And it is delicious! We started with the Burrata which is fire roasted tomatoes with fresh made mozzarella cheese ball, pesto and olive oil. The mozzarella cheese was fantastic!! They serve sliced bread with olive oil and red wine vinegar for dipping which was also delicious. I had the Lobster Ravioli and my husband had the Seafood Pasta Special which included shrimp and muscles. The pasta is made fresh daily and not can you tell!! Everything was so good. They do waitlist seating on the website and I recommend it. It's a small place but the food is ready quickly. Our server Rachel was awesome and we really enjoyed chatting with her. We brought home homemade cannolis and I can't wait to have them!! Great food and great atmosphere.",

    "text": "First and foremost I want to say that the meals, service, staff and facility are all exceptional. I had ordered the butternut squash ra  Not sure why this says FOOD TRUCK in the description because the restaurant is certainly not a food truck.   It is small and apparently very busy so they have a virtual wait list process where you can text them to get on the list and they will text you when they are ready for you.   I had ordered ravioli off the menu when I saw a plate go by brimming with seafood. When I asked about it I learned that they had a few off-menu items that could be ordered and that cioppino was what I had seen go by.   Although my ravioli had already beed started they very graciously allowed me to change my order and get the cioppino. It was AMAZING! Wow it really made me happy.   Although we had no trouble getting seats at the bar we have heard that it can be difficult to get in so call ahead and find out about the wait list, but if you like great Italian food do make the effort to get in and try this place. I think that it will make you happy too.",

We followed the starter with the branzino and the lamb specials, both of which were delicious.  The wines are reasonably priced, the staff is wonderful. Everyone is friendly, perfectly attentive, and we felt like regulars even though this was our first visit.  This is an independent restaurant on the west side. YOU MUST COME HERE!

The space isn't big and fills up fast- full by 5pm on a Saturday. The servers are friendly, greeting guests like family.   - Beet appetizer- Red and yellow roasted beets were tender and sweet, served over a smear of goat cheese and topped with arugula. The arugula actually tasted like real arugula with a nice peppery kick.  - Burrata- a good sized ball topped with a fabulous pesto sauce and served with nice whole roasted tomatoes. Save some of the complimentary bread to enjoy with this. - Pear salad- not super exciting (maybe since it's not really pear season), but loved the arugula and the cheese shaved on top was tasty. - Margherita pizza- this is a True test of a restaurant- crust was perfect, sauce tasty, cheese and basil- just the right amount. With a sprinkle of crushed red pepper, this was really great. - Butternut squash ravioli- omg, these were incredible! We ordered the HH portion which comes with 3 big pieces, stuffed with a sweet squash filling. The cream sauce has a fab sage flavor. We were scraping the plate with the leftover bread.  I know my mom would love this place, so I'm def bringing her next time she's in town. Will be back. Recommend.",

I checked the website and the had a waiting list however we both agreed to make an attempt anyway.  We typically will go to the bar to grab a seat because we love conversing with others at the bar versus seated at a table.  The staff was exceptional , our waiter suggested the Scallops appetizer which we ordered and was nothing short of amazing.  I ordered the Rack of Lamb rare that was roasted in a wood fired oven and my wife ordered the Cioppino, both were incredible, my wife couldn't finish her Cioppino so now I have a midnight snack.  We didn't have room for dessert but we ended up taking a Cannoli and a Napolean to go.  Fabio and the great staff, you have a gem of a restaurant that is the best in the valley.  Thank you, I have already told  friends about this wonderland of Italian delights. Oh if I forgot the bread was to die for.  Fabio on Fire is a must. Thank you Ken & Renee",

    "text": "Wow the west side finally has a reason to go out for a meal. Love the authenticity and feeling of this restaurant. Very friendly when you walk in, everything is in the open like a True Italian kitchen.  Authentic Italian dishes, pizza, deserts, and beers! Can't wait to have a sit down dinner experience!! Today grabbed a cannoli, pizza, and Birra Moretti = perfecto!   Update: we've had the pleasure of eating in the restaurant several times now and each experience has been great. Everyone is friendly and the staff works well making everything happen in a small cozy intimate setting. Tip: don't want to wait either sit at community table or bar. Fabio himself is fantastic and his staff is a wonderful compliment to what we consider the best Italian cuisine in Arizona. Food recommendations: butternut squash raviolis, any of pizzas crispy, rack of lamb, gelato, and cannolis! Enjoy!!",

They let me try their Bolognese souse, it's a bomb! Franco was the best, get there early, not very big but worth the wait if you have to. The only suggestion I have is to improve on their white wine selection from Italy. Also look at some good, refreshing Roses, not bone dry and a proseco to cleanse your pallet and get prepared for a marvelous meal. HIGHLY Recommend!",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this 5 stars. So let's get the drawback out of the way. We had one of the pizzas and except for the outer crust, the center crust was unable to hold up to the toppings.   But what I could could rave about is everything else. Family owned and run and pride of place is evident in the friendly service of our waiter to the owner checking in with each table to the thoroughness in the wiping of the tables. Having been to Italy, this is THE most authentic experience of a restaurant in Italy that I have experienced in the U.S.   Wine and beer choices are limited which is fine. The flavors of our pizza were far better than expected. We had the Tarantina pizza which was a bit out of our comfort zone for our usual pizza topping choices and the flavors just blended and popped. We were looking for a dinner in the shared pizza price range and were most pleased. Next time we return, my BFF says he will opt for lasagna and I know I shall opt for one of the ravioli specials which are constantly rotating.   We seldom eat dessert, but with the display of cookies, tiramisu and Napoleons along with what our waiter related was the gelato of the day, we had to share a cannoli. Since the best cannoli I've had are found in New York City, I was transported back to Little Italy with the fire bite.   Did I mention the whole restaurant applauding and smiling when a  woman celebrating her birthday was sung Happy Birthday in Italian?  My daughter spent a year in Milan and the first thing I did when we left was text her to say this was a must for an authentic experience.",

I hear the food is great but the first time we came in (about two weeks after they had opened), we walked in the door (was propped open) and were refused service because they were not opening for 10 more minutes. The second time we arrived, the female hostess was on the phone for about 5 minutes before she looked up. And then, she told us to come back bc they had a big party coming in. And tonight, we waited by the hostess stand for a good 10 minutes before anyone even said hello. I am sad to hear a small neighborhood restaurant is not more concerned about service. I am also not somebody that typically complains and like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Sorry...three strikes and you are out!",

The homemade bread loaves wonderful with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The house wines include a sangiovese, a super Tuscan, a chianti, and a primitivo, some of my favorite Italian reds.

Fabio and all the staff,  assuming they are family,  make you feel like you're eating in their home and are long time friends.  The drink selections were limited as their liquor license is pending.  I had the salciccia e funghi (sausage and mushroom) pizza that was so delish!  My husband had lasagna and said it was the best he's ever had.  I'm not a fan of lasagna but after him saying that,  I had to try it.  He was right,  it was delicious and I will order it next time.  We ordered pistachio and traditional cannolli to go and I ate mine for breakfast!  I'm ready to go back to try the rest of their menu.  I gave them 4 stars only because of the pending liquor license. When I can enjoy a good glass of wine with the excellent food,  I'm sure they won't disappoint.",

The cappuccino that I had with it was perfect.   As I ate I watched several other dishes coming from the kitchen that I must go back and try.

(no tomato sauce), but having imported buffalo mozzarella.  Frankly, the amount of cheese was skimpy. However, it was flavorful in total. Our server, from Roma, was very personable and conversation added to our dinner.",

No refill on water n not even sure who our waiter was.   Had to wave the bus boy down to get an appetizer ordered.   Ordered food from someone else who did know English well enough to communicate to us. Also one of my table guests ordered sausage and broccoli and they were out of broccoli.  No one at my table was raving about the food.  The meatball appetizer was 9 for 5 meatballs and very dry.  One guest wanted wine with her meal and she asked for a recommendation and he said I will get that for you but then came back and said they were out of that.  It was one disappointment after another.    This is a genuine Italian place and they all speak Italian.     I wouldn't come back for the price.  Please try it for yourself and let me know your thoughts.  Maybe I'm not a True Italian but just in my soul.",

Give the Spiedini Di Peace a try, its 6 shrimps lightly breaded and grilled to perfection with a side of Arugula with cherry tomatoes.  Don't leave without having dessert! Many choices but our favorites are the Tiramisu & Diplomatico.  I will try the  Cannoli the next we are there.",

It is much smaller than I thought it would be put that kind of makes it very intimate. Most of the main workers there speak Italian m, which makes sense since the owner is from Italy. The food was pretty good overall. We tried the bruschetta moderna to start off and then had the cheese pizza for my kids and the Bianca Parma pizza. It was all very good.   The mascarpone was really good on the bruschetta. The kids enjoyed the cheese Neapolitan pizza. The Parma pizza was really good. I'm not the biggest fan of prosciutto if it is not more cooked and crispy but I definitely good. We would goo here again for sure. Would love to try their pastas.",

The hostess actually called and told us when a table would be ready which was about an hour and 15 minutes later. Our waiter was very kind and helpful and explained several items on the menu. The restaurant has its regulars and a sense of community, which I have not seen in Peoria before. We had the pear salad which was very good. The homemade bread that they serve was very good. The pasta bolognese was exquisite. My husband said it was the best pasta dish he's ever had. The bufalina pizza was amazing. You could taste all of the ingredients. We had the tiramisu for dessert. It was so good. Every dish around us looked amazing. I wish I could just take a bite out of everyone's entrees We will def be back to try more things.",

    "text": "After much urging from my Italian friends in the west valley, we finally capitulated and gave this place a try.  However, we wanted our visit here to be purposeful and fun. Therefore, we opted to double date and catch up with long time friends who happen to live in North Phoenix.  We were all famished that day, so it was perfect timing for us to connect on a Saturday. We were so thankful that we heeded our friends' advice and made reservations early. This place is small, and gets packed easily.  For appetizers, we shared the Meatballs. It was okay. Nothing special, and the meat was a little bit undercooked. However, since we were so engaged in catching up with our dear friends, we really didn't pay much attention to the mediocre appetizers.  Then came the main courses. Altogether, we had the Spinach Ravioli, Eggplant Parmigiana, and two massive Lasagnas!  I typically order Eggplant Parmigiana as an intro to an Italian restaurant's cooking acumen. Eggplant, if not properly prepared, is often dry or overcooked - sometime even burnt! This one was just right. It was a little heavy on the sauce, and it over saturated the flavor of the eggplant. But, it was good, nonetheless.  My wife's Spinach Ravioli was just mediocre. The Sauce that enveloped the raviolis was delightful. But, the ravioli's internal consistency was quite bland and unappetizing. Surprising for an Italian restaurant.  The Lasagnas were massive in serving, and that was their strong suit. Additionally, the meat inside was splendid. However, the pasta was too pasty as if it was under cooked. And the sauce's lack of flavor and spice was simply underwhelming.  By the time we got our meals, the place was bustling, crowded and loud. There was a point wherein we finally just ended our prolonged catching up, and just agreed to pick another time to continue.  This isn't a bad place. However, it's not stupendous either.",

Fabio, is very much on fire, with his homemade dough, buffalo mozzarella, sausage, all with the ingredients from his homeland. The wine list is of simple value and exceptional, exactly what you would find in Italy.  Pizza here is eaten with a fork and knife just like you would find in Sorrento or ol' Napoli! Dinners are excellent with great flavor and some home made pasta dishes.  Once you are done with your meal, then the next delight are the desserts! Again, all homemade recipes. Cannoli, tiramisu and Italian cookies line this awesome bakery case. Even though you will get a great meal, it is a bonus to walk into a place with an exceptional staff. They treat you like a guest and you feel every bit one, even through their busiest hours! I am sure once you go, it will become a tradition for years to come. Bon Appetite!",

The waitress took my son over to watch Fabio make and then bake his pizza. He absolutely LOVED this, and the pizza was fantastic (my picky 8 year old ate his entire kid's pizza, then 3 slices of my sausage & mushroom). It's a pretty small place, with an indoor capacity of ~40. The pasta dishes I saw delivered to nearby tables smelled amazing, and the homemade gelato was delicious. Can't wait to try more items from the menu.",

Here are my thoughts; the service was Terrible, took 15 minutes to get a glass of water, another seven minutes to order, The menu was really confusing and we felt like the pizza at char was 100x better. Not to me mention the POS system is an iPad.  I get that they have only been open for 7 weeks however I would be shocked if they made 7 months",

We got a table on time despite it being pretty busy for a Sunday. Our server came and introduced himself and told us about the restaurant. They have homemade pasta and fresh baked bread and wildfires pizza.   We ordered a burrata and pear salad to start with. The burrata came with roasted Campari tomatoes and pesto. I would have like the tomatoes to have a bit more flavor but the mozzarella was super fresh and with the delicious bread it was a win.  The pear salad was perfect with the spice from the arugula and the sweetness of in season pear.  The toasted shaved almonds were a nice surprise as well. It was dressed perfectly too. Not soggy at al and not too dry.    For my entree I ordered the salciccio and funghi pizza. OMG it was perfection!!!! The sauce was perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms were fresh and the sausage wasn't too overpowering. It was the perfect Neapolitan style pizza. Bubbly, crispy, and chewy at the crust with some char and saucy and thin in the center. The rest of the family all got pastas and everyone's came seasoned perfectly and the pasta was the perfect texture with a nice amount of sauce on top.  We finished with a box of assorted homemade Italian cookies and oh my word they were delicious.   I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this place to everyone!",

It's a cramped little spot, tables seem like they don't fit right. The teenager that sat us seemed put off by the fact that I didn't want to sit at a tiny table for 2 people (for the record I am a 6' tall female), so we opted for sitting outside. The outdoor patio is nice and it was a lovely evening, so I cooled my jets and felt much less  bitchy. We ordered drinks and were served delicious house made bread with oil and balsamic. Husband ordered a pizza and I ordered the lobster ravioli.  The pizza needed a few more minutes in the oven, but the sauce and toppings were good. The ravioli had a vodka sauce and were so delicious! It took a while to get the food, but we were not in a hurry so it was fine.  We both ordered dessert. Tiramisu and strawberry gelato and both were amazing, but the gelato was the star.",

Finally I went myself only and was seated immediately at the counter bar while others still had over a one hour wait. First of all this place is way too small for the demand. Sat at the bar with a direct view of Fabio working the wood burning pizza oven, so I was happy.   Ordered a garden salad and lasagna. The garden salad was a very basic salad, a bit under dressed but ok. I'd order another one of their salads when I go again. The lasagna was absolutely outsranding. A huge portion, I only ate half and have a lunch today. It had a boulanese sauce which was meaty, rich and very tasty. The cheese and noodles were perfect. Service was very good as well.  I was able to talk with Fabio a bit and he said he's stunned by the flood of customers. West Peoria is a culinary desert so when a good place opens up, they are instantly successful. I wish other good places underdtood tgat. He also mentioned that even in this location a very short period of time, he's looking to expand. I hope so because I'll be going back and it would be nice not to have an hour wait each time.",

We had bruschetta (on amazing fresh bread) and Caesar salad to start and then moved on to some of the best tasting pizzas you can get.  Everything was made to order for all of the guests--fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection, and fast as well!  They were so organized and there was never any long waits.  It was a great flow and great service.  Having Fabio was such a great addition to the shower.  The wood fire oven is beautiful and really added such a neat element to our theme.

I moved to Arizona three years ago and while I'm still happy with my decision, there are a few things about New York City that I miss and a good Italian restaurant is one of them. Fabio seems to have some growing pains that they will no doubt resolve but the most important reason to go is the food and they have that well conceived and well executed. The menu is small, but there's something for everyone and the specials were so enticing that all three of us went for the special, while saying we'd be back to order some of the menu items that caught our eye.

Most people who know me, know that I am a big supporter of locally owned restaurants, so when I heard about Fabio opening a restaurant in Peoria, I knew we had to try it! It was fabulous! First, the bread is the best I have eaten. Fresh with a crunchy crust that had a good chew to it, as well. The inside, soft, yet substantial. I am pretty sure I ate half a loaf. I ordered the Tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce. Excellent! Homemade pasta and sauce. I didn't order a salad, but the ones that people ordered looked delicious and were very generous in size.  The pizzas are wood fired in the oven, which is the prominent feature of the restaurant interior. Everyone raved about their pizzas. After the meal we had gelato and several of the desserts to pass around. The gelato is house made and so creamy and good. The different pastries sampled, were outstanding.  I plan to make this one of my regular places to dine. The inside is well appointed and it is perfect for a date night or lunch/dinner with friends.",

    "text": "Fabio on Fire was our late night treat for our wedding, and everyone LOVED his pizza. Not only was the pizza amazing, but Fabio and his staff were so sweet. Fabio actually gave me and my mom hand written cards to congratulate us, which I thought was such a nice gesture. I feel bad because our guests ate all 40 pizzas we had ordered in less than an hour, and I was kind of rude to Fabio when they said \"no more\" (because I hadn't gotten any yet). We finally decided to just pay for more pizzas...and they were more than happy to make them. Giving me more pizza is the easiest way to make me happy ;-)   Anyway, just wanted to say thanks so much for making my wedding night so special, Fabio!!! Everyone loved you and your pizza! :-)",

She returned with beverages and pieces of scrumptious Italian ciabatta bread, fresh from the oven.  OMG, amazing!  Luckily, they sell loaves of this bread.  We ordered pizzas which were hand-crafted and baked in a stone oven. They were delicious.  We ended our meal with cappuccino and HOME-MADE gelato.  The strawberry gelato had fresh strawberries in it, and the lemon had a bright tartness to it.  This is the closest we've found to the flavors of gelato we experienced in Italy. So happy to have this new independently owned restaurant in Peoria!",

First,  the server told us his life story before even asking what we would like to drink. Then things went downhill from there,  took forever to get utensils,  we didn't get serving plates until halfway through dinner, never got the serving spoons we had to ask for, and server never came back until bill came and he gave us the wrong bill.

It was better than some in the area but not what I expect for that price. Everything looked ala carte so for only 7 raviolis ( no salad or anything). $17 is high.  I left hungry. Shared a tiramisu which was excellent and worth the $7.95.  Both my friend and I were a bit disappointed.  Perhaps if they included some greens on the plate the price wouldn't appear so high. Unlikely to return",

    "text": "Came back to Fabio to dine in and try some other dishes.  It was Saturday night and packed to the gills.  The place is so small it doesn't take very much to fill it up.   We were sat on the patio with an older gentleman as our waiter.  He was extremely slow.  He moved slow and talked slow and stopped to chat at every table.    We were getting ready to leave and a younger man brought us some bread.  We ate the bread and still were waiting for the waiter.  Our glasses of water were empty and never refilled.    Once again ready to leave the waiter finally comes by.  Nice enough fellow but the sense of urgency as a 140 year old 3 legged turtle.  We ordered our food and begin to wait again.  Food finally comes out.  The pizza was amazing.  Great crust, perfectly balanced, fresh ingredients, slightly burnt.  Highly recommend the diavola.  The lobster raviolis were terrible.  The flavor was bland, the lobster was fishy.  Just bad all around.  The salad we ordered was basically arugula with some olive oil and a quarter of a pear sliced up.  This isn't a salad this is the base of a salad.  Where is the rest??  The owner came out to our table and was extremely friendly and nice.  I really wish him well.  He'd be better off putting this waiter as the host and getting someone else in there for starters.  Our bill came out to $80+.  No where near worth that.  I would only come back at this point to order pizzas to go.",

There is a wide variety of authentic pizzas -- and even one \"American style\" pizza. All are fabulous, and if you let your taste-bud-desire be your guide you won't be disappointed.  But the best dishes are not the pizzas -- but the pastas. On my last visit I had the short rib ravioli, and others at my table had lobster ravioli. The handmade pasta was cooked to perfection and the seasoning was spot on.  The house red wine is a notch or two above the normal as well.  The servers are congenial, mostly Italian, and food lovers themselves...and their passion for the food they serve is evident in everything they do.  Bravo! Brava!",

The only thing that I didn't like was the amount of money that we paid for and it was a twist off top. Seemed kind of cheap. The food was all excellent! We got two pizzas, A margarita and one that came with balsamic, arugula and Parmesan on top. It was missing the balsamic vinegar at. But it was still great! My in-laws really enjoyed their margarita pizza as well! My husband and I also split the special of spinach ravioli with a creamy walnut sauce. It was the best ravioli I've ever had!

The pasta is so tender and fresh! It's clear that lots of love and care goes in to everything. I also tasted the Butternut squash ravioli, which is their specialty, and it was so flavorful I kept taking little tastes of the sage sauce because I could not figure out how they could pack so much flavor into it.

    "text": "Fabio On Fire recently opened a brick and mortar location in Peoria AZ. This company is already established and well known as a mobile catering company and also participates in festivals and farmer's markets in metro Phoenix serving up Italian Baked Goods and Neapolitan Style Pizzas.  The New brick and mortar Restaurant offers appetizers, mostly authentic style Neapolitan Style Pizzas, House Made Pastas, Amazing looking Baked Goods and House Made Gelato.  We tried the Diavola and the Marinara Pizzas. The Pizzas are for sure high quality. The crust is thin and was blistered and charred but not burnt. The crust had a great flavor and chew but it was typical of the Neapolitan Style and had a wet but not too wet center. The Diavoli was topped with a high quality hard to come by spicy salami and the Marinara was topped with wildly flavorful sauce that was also very garlicky.  The pizzas are light and thin and don't weigh you down like the way most pizza does.  Thanks to my husband who helped me with a couple slices we got to try some house made gelato. We tried the chocolate and the strawberry. The chocolate taste like the Italian Chocolate Bar my in-laws just brought back from Italy. It might be slightly an inquired taste........The strawberry gelato might have been the BEST or was one of the BEST Gelato I've ever tried anywhere! It truly was pure bliss.   The dining room is casual and nice and is in full view of the open kitchen and dessert case. It looks like they might offer patio seating in the future.  I saw a liquor license application in the window but at the time of my visit they only offer water and mostly Italian beverages.  Service was off the charts amazing we were greeted by Fiorello Herself from Fiorello's Ristorante. It was so nice seeing her again.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I never really understood the idea of \"al dente\" or the \"The pasta is not swimming in sauce\" comments you would hear all those cooking shows say.   Having eaten pasta for longer than I care to admit,  I feel as though I've been cheated by the restaurants serving the noodles and goop I have been eating. Now on to the review...  My wife and I went on the advice of friends that recently returned from a three week stay in Italy.  They said that if I wanted real authentic Italian food, then Fabio's is the place for us. So, we went and had buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto salad, spaghetti w/mussels and shrimp, short rib ravioli, and strawberry gelato.    The cheese and prosciutto were delicious. The pasta was the best I have ever EVER had. I totally get the al dente now. The sauces coated the pasta as opposed to a ladle of red stuff with meat slopped in the middle of flavorless noodles.  So I guess those TV chefs knew all along what pasta is supposed to be, huh?  The strawberry gelato was also perfecto. The kind of OMG I need to sit down before I pass out kind of good.  Yes, it's a tad pricy, and yes it's True that you don't get endless plates of dreck to gorge on, BUT you will get the best tasting meal you may have ever had. No, I don't say that lightly. It really was that good and I plan on going again tomorrow.    As far as service goes, everyone was super friendly. Fabio came by to introduce himself before the food was even served. Rafael knew every detail of what you were going to eat, and we chatted like old friends about his family.  I had the good fortune of living in Europe while stationed in Germany. The \"service\" was just as I remembered.  No, they don't hover over you and hand you your check before you swallow that last bite. Rather, they treated us like guests. That's how it's done over there.  It's slightly slow by American standards, but I didn't want American-Italian, I wanted Italian-Italian and that is exactly what they gave us. The portion size was also perfect. While the food was so good I wanted to eat more and more and even more; I was full but not painfully so. The bang for your buck IS there in quality not necessarily quantity.  I'm perfectly fine with that.",

    "text": "This place is simply amazing. It's a beautiful little eatery sort of tucked away. The patio is beautiful tonight and the food was absolutely spectacular. I had the braised short rib ravioli in a buttercream sage sauce. It was rich, but not too rich, and SO full of flavor. My son had a pizza. The crust was one of the best I've ever tasted. Everything is freshly made and you can see the herbs growing in planters on the patio. For dessert we had a cannoli and the Napoleon. The Napoleon pastry was so incredibly flakey and the Chantilly cream was light and smooth. The cannoli pastry had the perfect snap and just the right amount of cinnamon.  Most of the crew speaks Italian and they are incredibly friendly. The way they speak of the food is as if it's made of magic. The owner/chef is Italian and his recipes have been passed through the generations; their pictures are on the walls. Call ahead to have your name placed on the list, but walkups are welcome too. It's not very big and it does get busy quickly. This is a WONDERFUL date night spot and they do have a limited kids menu as well. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this establishment.",

The pizza is really good and easily competes with the best wood fired places in the valley.  They have frequent special dishes including appetizers that aren't on the menu.

    "text": "We were given this place high praise and we were hopeful that finally a good non-chain type restaurant was on the west side.  Disappointment was slow in coming. First we were seated on the side patio near a very large, noisy party and decided against moving.   Then, not familiar with Italian wines, we asked the waiter for suggestions; he, of course recommended the most expensive.   My wife enjoyed that small but $14 glass while i had an Italian beer to keep the mood going.    We decided to order a pizza, but saw that they were $17 and up for 12 inch individual pizzas.  We ordered two salads with our pizza and ended taking some home.  The salads were great, i had mixed green and my wife had the pear after mistakenly receiving the strawberry.  The pizza finally arrived and it was soggy.  Overlooking that the, crust was very good, in the style of Bianca's in Phoenix.  They do have a high-end oven.  We skipped dessert and ended up over $60 with an udeserved tip of 15% paid while the waiter hovered over us telling us to pick either 15, 20, 25 percent tip.   All in all, I have concluded that the experience would have been one and a half stars better having a waiter without the attitude.   Well, we intend to continue our search for a west side Italian eatery.",

The wait for food was a bit too long and i could tell others near us were getting a little impatient with their wait as well.  However, the owner came out and went from table to table and made quick friends.  He knows customer service for sure.   The portion sizes seemed a bit off to me.  I had a very large portion size of spaghetti while my boyfriend, who ordered the entree of ravioli, got a much smaller portion. The tortellini portion size seemed a bit small too.

    "text": "The saving grace of this restaurant was the food. My wife and I rarely get the opportunity to go out and dine with our two kids because of my unique work hours. Tonight we finally had an opportunity and I chose Fabio on Fire because of the great reviews. The waitlist feature worked very well, so I should compliment the restaurant on having such a fantastic time saving feature implemented. We were presented with waters and a bread basket along with olive oil and a drop of balsamic. We were then asked by the server assistant who dropped them off\"Do you guys really want balsamic?\", in an inconvenienced type of tone. I said yes please. \" Oh, ok, I'm going to have to grab some then. I ran out when I was making the plate\" was the response. His tone continued to suggest that it was a major inconvenience and I didn't understand why he was speaking in such a matter. Ten minutes went by before we had our very first brief interaction with our server. He asked if we wanted anything else to drink and if we decided on what we were having? I said that we decided on an appetizer to begin with. He proceeded to say ok and suggested a seafood appetizer as he walked away to another table. He clearly didn't hear what I said or pay any attention which became the reoccurring theme of the night. He came back five minutes later and asked if we were ready in a very rushed and pushy matter. I said that we would like to start off with the imported cheese as an appetizer and that my wife would like the Valpolicella and I would like to have the Barbera d'Alba. He said ok, so two reds. I said yes, and repeated the names of the wines. My wife then ordered her main dish and then I ordered mine. He then proceeded to say the infamous two reds quote that he was fond of. I said yes please and repeated the names of the wines for the third time. You could tell that he wanted to get through the order as quickly as possible and was not listening. I felt at that point that he was going to make the wine decision for me. For work, I sell imported wines to restaurants with Italian wines being a very robust section of my portfolio. I'm well versed in them and understand them very well and I know what I would like with my dining experience. This was our last interaction with our waiter until the end. The wine was served to us by another individual and I knew that it was incorrect and I felt that we were given what he thought we should have. Maybe he had to achieve a certain amount of wine sold for a particular bottle and took it upon himself to charge that one instead. I'm just assuming of course. I would have asked the waiter If he would have come back to the table at any point in time. He visited other tables around us very frequently but didn't want to come near us. Could it have been that he assumed a couple with two kids wouldn't tip well so why try? Once again I'm assuming. It truly felt like we were not nearly as important as any of his other tables. We did receive water refills and a bread basket refill upon asking other employees. That was after sitting with an empty water glass and bread basket for a long period of time. As a patron of a restaurant that charges the amount of money that they do, I should not have to continuously ask for things. My needs should be anticipated through constant check backs at the table to make sure that I'm having an enjoyable experience. That's how you find out about any problems and fix them in a timely matter. After we finished our main courses, another employee cleared our plates and asked if we would like dessert. I declined because both my wife and I wanted to get out of the restaurant as quickly as possible at this point. He then asked who our waiter was. I replied saying that I'm not sure, and that his guess was as good as ours. We hadn't seen him at the table since he took our order. The employee smiled and walked away. Our waiter came out a few minutes later with his tablet and presented me with the bill via the tablet screen. My suspicion was right about the wines and I noticed that he gave me a different wine then what I ordered. I have him my card and he forcibly placed the square card reading unit on the table. I bit my tongue because I had promised my wife that I would not make a scene because she wanted to leave as soon as possible. I proceeded to tip 10% while he hovered over my shoulder ,which is extremely low to me. I did it in hopes that he tipped out all the other individuals who were actually doing his job at our table for the evening. We felt extremely unwanted in what seemed to be a very welcoming establishment to all others around us. What should have been a great experience that my family could have enjoyed turned into remorse for even making the attempt to go out.",

    "text": "What a hidden gem! We stumbled across this place after visiting a neighboring brewery (also amazing). We were greeted by our waiter right away...and I love his Italian accent. We each had a glass of wine and started with the mozzarella and prosciutto. Wow! I've never had mozzarella be so tasty (imported in from Naples!). Then we enjoyed the evening's specials which included short rib raviolis and the lobster ravioli (sooo good). The sauce tastes like REAL sauce...fresh and flavorful. Then we indulged in dessert. I'm a bit of a cannoli snob but one bite in and I knew it was made right. So good, as was the tiramisu. In fact, it was so delicious we brought home 2 dozen cookies too (couldn't resist).  I've been to many high dollar fancy Italian restaurants across the county and THIS place, the quality of the meal, surpasses most and rivals the best, yet in a very non-pretentious setting. It was perfect and I can't wait to go back.",

They don't take reservations, the restaurant is poorly arranged and incredibly cramped (servers tripping over each other, tables mere inches apart, noise level is basically a roaring din --- it felt like eating at an Arbys at a Bus Station in Newark).   The food was nothing spectacular either - the burrata  appetizer was very basic, and you can get better at Fry's Marketplace up the road. The rotating special Tortelli was good, but the four cheese Gnocchi was incredibly gummy and I honestly hate to say this, but, the sauce totally smelled like my dog's food. Wildly unappealing.  I will say our server was genuine and nice, though he forgot to ask me for a refill of wine. The credit card app didn't work and the server had to go stand by the window to get a signal - it's 2017, how is that a thing?   This place gets an insane amount of positive buzz on Facebook and on Nextdoor. I think people are just excited for a restaurant in the area that's not McDonalds.",

Your pizzas were delicious and provided the perfect fuel for both the kids and adults to trick-or-treat for hours!  We thought your prices were moderate at $8 - $9 per pizza... we shared a Margherita, an American, and one with spicy sausage that isn't listed on the website.  I'm bummed I didn't take pictures!  I hear that Fabio also makes appearances at Old Town and Ahwatukee Farmers Markets on occasion and in addition to pizza, they sell fresh bread, cookies and pastries... if those things are made with as much passion as the pizza, then they are definitely worth a shot.  Chef Fabio is available for hire for special events and will bring his mobile wood-fired oven to you (as he did for our Halloween block party last night).  If you hire him, please send me an invitation to join ;)",

Started off with homemade Italian bread from the woodfire oven. Then we had the Caprese. The fresh mozzarella was so delicious, as was the balsamic glaze. More bread was delivered-tried it dipped in the balsamic and it was taken to a new level! Next we shared the handmade Gnocchi with four cheese sauce. Words can't explain this dish- amazing. And we also tried their meatballs in marinara sauce- the best meatballs I've ever had. Barely enough room left for dessert, so we shared the original cannoli, which was filled with a refreshingly light and fluffy filling with just the right amount of chocolate chips. We loved our first experience here and we will be back! Thank you, Fabio for bringing in a nice original restaurant into our Peoria neighborhood!",

We had been in about two weeks ago and he remembered us and greeted us like old friends. We ordered the Caprese salad, and the homemade mozzarella was some of the best I've had since our visit to Rome a few years ago.

    "text": "The food was exceptional! I had the tagliatelle bolognese. I cannot rave enough about it. The dish was a perfect portion. The food felt light yet bursting with flavor. The freshness of the ingredients shines through in the finished product. The pasta itself was the perfect amount of firmness and it is home made. My husband had the pizza diavola which was also delicious. As it's name implies it has a kick to it. The pizza is thin with a deliciously soft and fluffy crust. The sauce again light and robust with flavor. We ended our meal with gelato vanilla and chocolate. Each amazing in their own way. The chocolate is smooth and rich. If you are a chocolate lover the flavor will dance on your palette. The va ills was just as good. Highly recommend this for delicious Italian food. Already looking forward to coming back!",

The food was OK, but nothing special.  The service was horrendous.  We were not informed of the specials, no server checked on us during our meal (I would have liked a second glass of wine or at least to have my water glass refilled; we were interested in ordering dessert).  We waited quite a while before informing Fabio himself that we desired attention.  No explanation, apology or compensation for the inattentive service.  Not a pleasant dining experience.",

I seldom enjoy eating out - until now. The food at Fabio on Fire is prepared the right way - full of flavor and delicious to the last bite. We love it all: appetizers, pizzas, pasta dishes, cookies and desserts. All wonderful! This is the first time in a long time that I'm so excited about eating out and so happy to recommend it to others. Keep up the great job Fabio!",

The pizza had good flavor each time I've ordered it, but the middle of the pizza is not firm therefore, when you try to pick it up to eat or just put on your plate the toppings fall off.  Fabio needs to work on service. He typically does not have enough help.  I would recommend to try, although it is a small restaurant so there maybe a wait.  I suggest going at lunch on the weekends.  So glad to see he is doing well.",

We had the farro appetizer, the strawberry salad,  Salciccia e fungi pizza, the gnocchi with pesto and the tagliatelle alla bolognese. We shared everything family style and my husband, a chef, ALMOST wouldn't share the tagliatelle, it was that tasty. The place was packed, the word is out--come here for great food in a family-friendly location. They are waiting for their liquor license to be approved, should be soon, which will allow you to enjoy beer or wine with that wonderful food (read no hard liquor ). Until then, sparkling Pelligrino, sodas, cappuccino,  iced tea, etc. Our servers were friendly, helpful and truly hospitable. Oh, and the bread!! Take a loaf home with you--or maybe some of their delicious butter cookies, housemade. All in all, you won't find better Italian in Peoria than here at Fabio's.",

I will say that I have eaten early in the life of other restaurants and there is always some type of growing pains especially as early as day five. Not here!!!  The food was amazing!!  I've been looking for a good Italian restaurant that is authentic and not commercial. Fabio's on Fire was all that and more. The bread basket with house made bread and olive oil with balsamic for dipping was a good place to start. We shared the Caprese salad that had fresh basil right off a stalk and the creamiest mozzarella I may have ever eaten.  We also shared entrees. We had the Butternut Squash Ravioli with sage cream sauce and the Buffalina pizza.   The Ravioli was free form and so delicious I could not stop shaking my head at its sinful flavor. The pizza had some of that same creamy mozzarella with a tomato sauce bed and arugula on top. The crust was tasty with an absolutely perfect crispness from the wood fired oven. Both entrees were so good.  At this point we were full but no way were we leaving without their house made dessert. We chose the apple cake that was made from a recipe that was Fabio's Nona's and the strawberry cake made with marscapone.  Fabio's on Fire should be the next place you choose to have dinner. Mark my word you will be thanking me for telling you to do so!!!",
