I called before going to Snooze and spoke with hostess Clarissa who was so kind and friendly. She went and asked the chefs my questions and ensured we could eat with the allergy restrictions! When we arrived we were greeted and seated. Tim our server came over immediately and was terrific! He took my sons allergies seriously and ensured his safety! Food came out promptly and delicious! I'd highly recommend anyone who has food allergies/sensitivities to visit this location!",

It was a thirty min wait but they sat us in 15 mins. Saw it was pet friendly which I love, since I'm a pet lover.   I went for the lower east sider plate and it was delicious!

I took my 12 year old & 1 yr old. Food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the breakfast pot pie and finished it. My daughter ordered Nannas hot chocolate pancakes & it had a huge marshmallow on top & came with a chocolate syrup sauce. It was too much for her but if you want a dessert to share that breakfast dish is great! Lots of options for different diets. We will be back!!!",

It was a very cool set up with many booths and tables with chairs. We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a seat with the place being pretty full, mine as well we had 8 in our party. Snooze has a really great menu and many choices to choose from, and also have some unique flavors for pancakes. I got a green Chile burrito with black beans, egg,And cheese. It was a good burrito but my one downside is that the burrito was pretty cold, and everything inside of it was cold too. We also got pumpkin pancakes, a sausage biscuit type thing, and French toast. These were all very good. The service was also Good. If you were to want to go somewhere for a quick breakfast place I would recommend it",

The wait for a server to take our order was a bit longer than I would have hoped, but okay.  My biggest complaint was the food.  I ordered the house special omelet, which you customize for yourself, i.e., any three fillings, veg or meat.  I found the portions of the two meats and the jalapenos I ordered were quite miniscule, perhaps two tablespoons all together.  If you are a breakfast meat lover, try a different restaurant.  The price is right, though.  Not expensive at all,.",

The side of hash browns were addicting, creamy middle crispy outside and chives. I had a hot chai. You could get it spicy or sweet, I got the spicy and it was delicious. Only thing I wish was different was the hours. They serve 6:30 am to 2:30 pm. I would personally go any time of the day. They do have cocktails and a nice savory selection of dishes which I will try next time. Prices were very good for quality of ingredients.",

I came here with a friend for a birthday brunch and we waited about 40 minutes for a table. They have a text notification system to let you know when your table was ready...but it didn't work for us. Anywho, when we finally were seated it was on the patio which was great because of the nice weather. Dogs are allowed out on the patio and that was nice too since I like dogs (but unfortunately don't have any). The service was great, and the food was FANTASTIC. Try the OMG French Toast and Mimosas, they're game changers. I really enjoyed the place overall and had a great time.

So i got her to go again and of course her whole meal was cold when she got her food. She doesnt like to complain so she just dealt with it.   The whole vibe of snooze is hippyish and snooty. They only give straws by request and when you get one its made of paper. In the bathrooms there is a device on the bottom of the bathroom doors so you dont have to touch the handle like a normal human being. Im surprised this place doesnt have a safe space in the back.",

    "text": "Snooze is always a good spot for breakfast or brunch.. if you have the time and patience to wait. It's a pretty popular joint so always plan accordingly as the wait time will typically be at least be 30 minute to an hour long.   This was my first time at this new location and surprisingly it wasn't as busy. Could also be because it was a weekday morning.   Quality of food was great as always. I came here for my friend's birthday and she received a complimentary Cinnamon Roll pancake - which she loved!   Their pancakes are actually one of my favorites on the menu. Generous sized and not too sweet. The sweet potato pancake is my personal favorite!   Tip: the hash browns come cupped, which taste rather soggy in my opinion; so I always ask from them fried flat!",

    "text": "3.5/5  You Snooze you lose! At least that's what I thought when we left here around 10ish and there were already people waiting outside for a table. It wasn't too busy around 9ish when we got here though; there were plenty of tables available.   The interior is very retro. There's lots of orange and avocado green, with decor and menu design that harkens back to the '60s. The menu is very modern though, and I love how there's a little bit of everything for any type of appetite. Want something sweet? There's a lot of delicious pancake options. Want something lighter? There's a special section for healthier fare. Want a traditional breakfast? They have that too. I also really liked how there are multiple vegetarian and vegan options, and that any scramble can be made vegan by substituting tofu.   I started off with a latte with almond milk. It had a nice foamy layer with pretty latte art. The coffee was decent, although it did have a slight sour tinge to it.   After reading the description for it I knew I had to get the egg white frittata. It had wild mushrooms, garlic and roasted sweet potatoes topped with dressed arugula, cherry tomatoes, spiced pepitas, roasted corn salsa and shaved manchego. That's quite a lot of ingredients, and delicious ones to boot! There are no other sides that go with this dish, only the frittata. It was a good sized circle of egg white with a beautiful bounty of vegetables on top. I loved the different flavors and textures in each bite. The eggs themselves were light and fluffy, you can tell they did a great job whipping the egg whites to get them that nice ethereal texture. I didn't miss the yolk at all in this dish. If you want a little heat in your dish, they offer Cholula, Tabasco hot sauces (There might be another brand but I forgot which one it was). The Cholula comes in red or green! I've never seen green Cholula before, what a jalapeno revelation!  My friend who I ate with asked our server if she could have the same frittata, but with full egg instead of just egg white. The server wasn't sure and she didn't seem very eager to try to find out if the kitchen could offer this. I don't really see why they wouldn't be able to make a regular frittata and I'm not sure why they don't also offer this as a regular egg option. I've had plenty of egg white+yolk frittatas and they've come out fine. She ended up getting something similar, a regular scramble, with some of the same ingredients as the frittata.  I did feel like the price was a bit hefty for what we got. The latte was $4.50, and with almond milk an extra charge on top of that. For about the same price I can get a really good latte from one of my favorite coffee shops, and the frittata was also a little pricey for my tastes since I only received a single frittata with no other accompaniments included. Quite honestly I was still hungry after eating my meal. I don't doubt that they use high quality ingredients for the breakfast dishes though, and I do know that part of the proceeds goes towards giving back to the community (1% of sales).   As for the noise level, I didn't really feel like it was a very relaxing place to have breakfast or brunch. As more people came in to eat, it got really noisy and the music is more fast paced and also a bit loud so towards the end of my meal it was hard to converse with my friend without straining my ears or saying \"What?\" a few times.  I did see a nice little patio area that is dog friendly. I'd love to go back with the pups and have a nice breakfast or brunch on that patio sometime.",

Our server Rach C. was extremely attentive, apologetic if anything wasn't perfect, and a thousand times better than our last girl. The food was once again excellent, fresh, and value for money, only this time we could enjoy it because our server kept our drinks topped off. The music volume was still slightly a bit left to be desired, with very high bass levels, but for the most part, the restaurant was conversation loud which a restaurant has no control over, so that is acceptable. Once again, excellent interior and exterior, and fantastic outdoor seating. A great place for a Sunday lunch if you want a busy and popular hotspot. Thank you Snooze for the gift card and invitation to give you another chance. The gift card did not win us back, your servers performance and improved restaurant quality did that. We will return.",

    "text": "I'm just unsure what was going on here last Friday around 11am. We were promptly seated, greeted and given great suggestions when we ordered and ordered at the first opportunity. I am familiar with Snooze and their standards, as I come from Denver and was stoked to have a Snooze nearby! They sent out a pancake early for the table to munch on, but it was confusing because I had ordered a big pancake for my breakfast and the girl who brought it out didn't quite know what to say and was just mumbling words and after she walked away the whole table decided that they awkwardly brought my pancake out first, so I ate it. and then all the food came out and there was my actual pancake! Suddenly my first pancake was recognized as a gift for the entire table and not my appetizer. I am thankful that it wasn't one with PB or peanuts as I am allergic, but lets train the Snoozers to SPEAK UP, pleaseeeee. All in all, they change a few things on the menu with the seasons. There are a lot of creative things that you cannot get elsewhere, but there are also more simplistic things for the less adventurous. All is delicious no matter what catches your eye! Just be prepared to wait the time it takes to get a seat at any Denver location for your food here (about 30-45 min) The thing I miss the most off any Snooze menu was the Brioche French Toast with the amazing caramel like sauce and candied nuts!  Bonus: If you like the sound of the benedicts, but don't like the runny egg it is ok to get it scrambled! Also, there is a \"secret menu\".",

The bartender was super friendly and fast, but because we weren't eating food they asked us if we could move to the side for those that wanted to eat and sit at the bar. I also loved that they texted me to let me know our table was ready it was super convenient. The hostess Brooklyn was very friendly which made the experience even better.

It took aprox. 30+ minutes to get a classic breakfast, 3 eggs over easy, bacon, hash browns and toast, really?? 30+ minutes?? I had to ask someone to see if our order was in or if she forgot to place our order. As soon as he went in the back to check, the server came out with our food stating that she had put in our order immediately, that seems kind of strange when a family of 4 was seated well after us and received there food before I even asked someone to check on ours. She forgot or took her time to put it in, if you made a mistake, fine, we all do, but own it, don't lie.                          Now onto the food, my eggs were really runny and my husband was served food on a dirty plate. Yes, it was dirty, when he pointed it out, the server said oh it looks like blueberries, we did not order blueberries. We walked out at 12:53,  wasted an entire hour there. A woman stopped us on the way out, maybe a mgr. and offered to remake the food but at that point we were done. After waiting that long for the food to arrive that didn't look appetizing and served on a dirty plate we were pretty much disgusted. I waited the day to write this as I was pretty upset earlier, I am no less upset by the matter several hours later. Do yourself a favor and go to \"Butters\" in Scottsdale, good food, served within a reasonable time frame on clean plates.",

Good quality espresso drinks, too! We love trying \"pancake of the day\" - it's always a surprise in the flavor combinations in a pancake (like jalapeno and bacon inside). My husband loves their fresh housemade jelly to put on bread and their alcoholic beverages. I love that for a lot of dishes you can do a combo to try more than one dish, but in smaller quantities.",

It was perfectly cooked and the  Best I have ever had at a restaurant, and I am hard to please on this dish.. The coffee is also very flavorful. Now, the less good. Tuesday morning 11:00 and it still took over 1/2 hour to get our food. The coffee took  over 10 minutes. The noise level inside the restaurant was high.   And now the real  disappointment. I tried a side of pancake. I consider myself a pancake aficionado. The pancake was woefully  Under cooked and very doughy, no light and fluffy about it: inedible. Too bad customer service was not on this issue.  I wasn't offered  another pancake  after I showed them or an adjustment on the bill.  In fact, the waitress didn't seem to care. So, don't expect fast service, avoid the pancakes, and ask for quick coffee. I will go back and try again, in case they improve with the feedback I see they are getting.",

The pot pie is lovely and light. It's a pastry with sausage gravy and carrots. It's unlike biscuits and gravy, and unlike a real pot pie -- it's a unique dish, and quite nice. It is not heavily spiced, so it will not offend those who prefer food on the blander side, although a bit more spice would have suited me. I ordered my egg over medium rather than sunny side up, and it came out perfect. For an extra $4, I subbed out my hash browns for a pancake. The \"sunburst,\" or something like that: a lemon poppyseed pancake with blackberries on top. It was not too sweet, and the flavor was subtle but delicious.  It's a workday, so I had to resist the cafe cocktails. I need to come back on a weekend to try the AM Manhattan: bourbon, espresso, Irish cream, stranded milk, and a cherry. Yes, please. Next time.",

    "text": "**Let me start by saying I pretty much never write reviews, but I find it only fair to take the time to write a thorough review as to why my husband and I will absolutely recommend Snooze to anyone looking for a well run, fun and family friendly brunch spot.  My family and I LOVE finding new brunch places every weekend and this weekend Snooze on Ray caught my eye so we gave it a try. Since moving to Phoenix we've found that we either luck out big time and fall in love with a place or hate it.   Snooze was without a doubt a \"love\" type of restaurant for us. I'd say from the very start, checking in with the hostess' who were incredibly polite and sweet to hearing the totally reasonable wait time of 10 minutes given it was a Sunday morning with plenty of people waiting. As we were being seated our youngest daughter decided it was the perfect time to melt down, one of the wonderful ladies working went out of her way to bring our sweet girl some fresh fruit. My husband and I both agreed this alone scored the major points in our book!   The menu is phenomenal, who doesn't love the option to pick 2 separate styles of eggs Benedict when a restaurant has so many yummy versions. Not to mention the drinks, both alcoholic and not were so much fun and such a great variety of the typical breakfast drinks to totally uncommon and unique to Snooze finds.   As we ordered our waitress list off the different pancake choices to choose from for our daughter. As she read them the 'pineapple upside down cake pancake' caught my attention. I obviously expressed interest in this delicious sounding pancake so much so that later they brought one out to us. How unbelievably kind is that?!? I think this has only ever happened to my husband and I while dining at five star restaurants.   All and all our experience was impeccable, and though our youngest truly put up a good fight to allow us to enjoy our experience we still managed to walk away super pleased and happy. I fully attest this to the amazing service, feeling as though the individuals working truly cared which is so hard to come by these days. Looking forward to our next visit!!!",

One thing I didn't like about this place is that everything was greasy! I ordered the Snooze classic with extra grease.  If You were to touch the side of plate, walk outside, crack an egg on your palm, you would have a perfectly fried egg. The chicken sausage was also ok but once again so much grease! My friends plate was also in the same condition with grease all on the sides of the plate.   Eggs were cooked to perfection, the hash browns were crispy and seasoned well. The iced coffees were delicious and there Cuban cups of coffee.   Overall, customer service is there and got us in and out.",

The music was nice...not too loud or soft and a great variety from hip hop (Migos) to pop!   Second, the service was concierge...excellent. We never had dry mouths, dirty plates or anything else. Our server was upbeat, friendly and make great recommendations,  Now for the food....let me just say this is officially my Fav breakfast spot. We had the pancake flight (blueberry, pineapple upside down and the special for day...bacon filled), shrimp and grits, special spuds and mmm mmm mimosas.   I'm going to try everything as you should too!",

Our friend had half an order of French toast with a side of bacon and I had a stack of pancakes with a side of sausage. My wife thought her dish was just ok but not something she would order again. Our friend enjoyed her breakfast and my breakfast was fair at best. I expected the pancakes to be light and fluffy but they they were kind of thick and light or fluffy. Overall Snoize is very good place to go for breakfast.  Their service is excellent,  they have an extensive menu and they have a lively atmosphere. We'll be back but I'll pass on the pancakes.",

The flavors were unbelievable.  We also got a Sum'oa Cake to split and it was pure heaven.  I am so impressed that they will split plates without any hassle.  Now for the issues here.  They sat us with the bartender (not at the bar).  There were at least 10 other staff members milling about and the place was only about 1/8 full.  Because she was making drinks and entertaining the guests sitting at the bar, she never once attempted to refill our coffees.  We had to flag down two different wait staff at separate times to get refills.  Also, our food came out ice cold, I am assuming because she was unable to check on it when it was done in the window.  It was eventually ran out to us by yet another wait person.  The flavors were right on.  The food was fresh.  Unfortunately, it was just ice cold.  Finally, there was a guy in the place that I would assume was the manager.  He spent a lot of time looking at his cell phone, but I think he should have been checking on tables to see how things were going.  I will give this location another chance, but will be certain to ask not to be seated with the bartender.  If it weren't for the service and cold food, I would have given 5 stars hands down.",

I will say that once we did enjoy it! I would like to go back during the week or maybe when it's not so crowded! The options on the menu amazing! I feel like I could go here every day for two weeks and look at the same thing! Prices were reasonable I just thought it was way too packed!",

Our server was super attentive and immediately brought out bowls of cold water for our spoiled little fur babies, which was a huge plus. I started with the Mountain Mule - gin, grapefruit, ginger beer, lime and agave - which was refreshing and delicious. I absolutely LOVED the I Like You E'Lote Benedict. Instead of english muffins, they came on these amazing sweet corn and quinoa cakes and were topped with chili lime hollandaise. You can't really go wrong with any of their bennys, though, and if you're REALLY indecisive there's the option of getting a benny duo. The hash browns here are just meh... but you can upgrade to one of their signature pancakes for only $4. My favorites are the sweet potato pancakes with caramel and candied pecans, and the blueberry danish pancakes which come with the most amazing lemon cream cheese filling. For those of you looking for something seriously decadent to fill your cheat day, you can also get a flight of 3 pancakes. You're welcome.",

Talk about blown and blown away - I had to hide my Marshall digs.   We sped back and were escorted to our table outside. I thought, uggh, but it was very cool with the fans and mist. Of course Arizona knows what they are doing - and this east coast girl is just getting used to it.

My lady and I discovered Snooze by chance one day and now make a monthly trip from Tucson to Phoenix to eat there. We try something different every time, and everything is good! Even my least favorite item on the menu is well above average.   The breakfast pot pie is my current favorite, and they have an amazing array of pancakes, including seasonal and other specials.   In addition, the atmosphere is fun. Very quirky and modern. It is clean and the service has always been top notch.   Good news for you Tucson readers of this post! Snooze is coming to Tucson this fall!! I believe on W Grant, but I'm not completely certain.",

We enjoyed our time, I just wasn't enthusiastic about my eggs Benedict I ordered. It was the Bella Bella with cream cheese hollandaise, burrata, and I think a slice of soft cheese (not noticeable with all the hollandaise) and a balsamic drizzle on a ciabatta slice. It sounds a lot better than what it ended up being. The meat was folded and only covered about 1/4 of the toast so 3/4s of my meal was just egg and toast. The cream cheese hollandaise just tasted like regular hollandaise. The balsamic was so minimal I didn't taste it. My husband loved his breakfast pot pie, I will get that next time!",

    "text": "Stayed at Wild Horse Pass, this Eatery is just a hop and a skip away.   Impressed by the complimentary coffee while you wait for a table, nice touch for a restaurant that seems to always have a waitlist. For a chain restaurant I appreciate how they seem to go out of their way to support local charities and buy some locally sourced ingredients. Their mission to help serve their local communities reminded me a lot of Even Stevens Sandwiches. The staff were all sporting some type of PRIDE support, also really great!   We had the regular Beni III and the Breakfast Pot Pie, with 1 side breakfast taco and 1 side pancake. The pancake was disappointing, really dry. The hash browns that came with our meals were ok, not my favorite. They were more of a hash brown casserole-ish thing, kind of dry with a lot of pepper.   The breakfast taco was delicious, the green chile hollandaise on top of it was so good. They are good at hollandaise here because the hollandaise on the Beni was also on point- with plenty of lemon- just the way I like it! The ham on the Beni was flavorful and tasty. The Breakfast Pot Pie was a fun play on a traditional biscuits and gravy, we enjoyed it, their rosemary sausage gravy was really wonderful, light, but still rich at the same time. Not an overwhelmingly heavy gravy.   The service was a-ok. Surprised to see so many people waiting and so many empty tables at the same time? Maybe they didn't have enough staff to keep up?   Seems like a great place for a family breakfast, menu has plenty of traditional options and some more adventurous choices as well. Will gladly return when in the area.",

I ordered the breakfast burrito which had good flavors but wasn't served hot enough for my liking. The middle was just barely warm which took away from the flavors a bit. It comes with no meat by default (other than eggs of course), and costs about $2 to add a protein of your choice.  With a ton of boozy brunch drinks and creative dishes available, Snooze is a decent spot for basic brunching. However, after my experience with the literally lukewarm food and service, not sure if I'd be back again too soon.",

Had to request a coffee refill and was charged for it.  No apology for the delay, even though we observed the servers visiting in the corner.   While the food was decent, it was nothing special.  After an excruciatingly long wait, we would have expected our food to be warm and delicious. It wasn't. And, it was $44 for two people, not including the tip (yes, I reluctantly tipped).

Worth trying the pineapple upside down pancakes. Thick generous cakes that swam in a vanilla cream sauce, with chunky diced pineapple bits embedded in the pancakes. Bacon was thick and flavorful. Eggs cooked just right, slightly firm with yolk soft enough to run. 1 slice of toast though... for the price, an extra slice should have made an appearance.",

I ordered the breakfast tacos, and mine were good, so I am guessing they made my husbands first, and it sat there getting cold, and then made my tacos. Our total breakfast bill was over $30.00 for 2 meals, and no beverages, I told my husband to let our server know, but it had already taken so long for us to get our food.

While the much lauded breakfast (I tried the Snooze Spuds Deluxe) would rate around three or four stars, the coffee was easily worth five stars.  My cappuccino was perfect!  What impressed me most was the wait staff-- they were friendly and accommodating.  While many restaurants rush customers out the door, the staff at Snooze encouraged me to take my time and relax.

She didn't introduce herself and she had this look on her face like she didn't want to be there. She also took my ketchup when I wasn't even done with it to top it off she didn't even ask if she can take it she just reached right over my face WITHOUT SAYING EXCUSE ME and took it then walked away. How rude. While I was eating NOT EVEM DONE she starts taking my plate and I was like I'm not even done. Like wow she really wanted us gone! I really hope you guys address this problem. If she has poor customer service skills she shouldn't be working at a place like this!! Her name was Kayla by the way!",

We all loved it.The combination of flavors was spot on. The buttermilk pancake was good all on its own.  It was good to see they had a great mix of beverages available-- including a full bar.  We will definitely be back again.",

I had what was  equivelent to biskets an gravey but on a cresaint, eggs over medium, hash browns cake and side sausage patty. Wife had a mix of eggs benedict.  You can get two different ones with one meal. To top it off she suggested we get a pancake, pineapple upsidedown. This was excellent. Food was really good, coffee was a specialty blend and tasty. Overall wait time (they txt you), service and food were very good. 1 negitave is prepare to talk loud the place had no ceiling insulation and is very noisy. Always like having another breakfast place in Ahwatukee, since this is where the MiMi's was.",

Seriously, we're all in the service industry and most of us are servers and Eris is absolutely the way all servers should be. She even remembers what our usuals are. She takes time to make sure our food comes out perfect, and vegan for our friends who are vegan. She keeps us updated if there's a delay, and never hesitates to be friendly and kind.

We've been there twice, been told that the wait would be between 30-40 minutes and then waited an hour before being seated. Each time, they either \"lost\" or place in the queue or wrote down the wrong number. We're fine with a longer wait, but at least be realistic about the time, or be organized enough to adhere to your own time frames.   Both times, we were told that we were \"next\" and then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes as others were seated before us. And, they never actually apologized for any of this.   Until they fix their front desk, we will make the drive elsewhere for breakfast. No food is worth that kind of wait and treatment.",

I love how everything matches. It's my favorite.   The food is absolutely amazing. Everything I try it's really good. On this visit I had the avocado smashed eggs Benedict. Love them , Divine.   It was one of my friends birthday and they even brought her out a beautiful pancake with whip cream and fruit on top and a candle, it was so nice. We had coffee water hibiscus iced tea and hot tea between all four of us everyone loved it.   The birthday girl had Rancho Eggs , another friend had the upside down pineapple pan cake , then another friend had a egg white omelette. Everything was perfect.  Lots of parking in the lot.

I'll give that a bit of a pass because it was super busy on a Sunday.   The food was inexcusable. I got the salmon and latkes benny and my friend got the pineapple upside down pancakes. My salmon was too salty, the hollandaise was bad, and the hash browns on the side were formed into a puck,  while visibly appealing, meant that the entire inside was not browned. As for her pancakes, they were tough and tasted burnt. I ended up having to douse them in maple to make them edible because she couldn't stand them. Her iced tea was some of the worst I've ever had. It was worse than McDonald's tea.   It's overpriced for shitty food. I regret not going to the IHOP across the street.",

This morning the patio was inviting... cool breeze, quieter environment than the inside dining room... why not take advantage of early fall temperatures? It was a veggie taco breakfast for me, French toast and bacon for Jean and pancake and  sausages for Ron.   My dish was ok, l didnt love it.  The mixture of watered down scrambled eggs, pico de gallo, jack cheese, invisible green hollandaise and pretty much uncooked hash brown (call it \"hash white\" rather) didnt work for me.   Jean's bacon looked on point and so did her French toast.  Ron's pancakes looked large and dense, sausages looked great.",

It took almost 10 mins for a basic refund followed by a rude comment of \"oh well here comes your food, too bad you won't be getting it since you want your refund\" and a lot of rude eye rolling by both employees I interacted with.

The menu has a wide array of food items, very creative flavor combinations. They have a full bar Along with full espresso bar, so that's nice. Our server was nice and efficient we got our food quickly after we ordered.  The food was amazing when it came out. Everyone in my party was very pleased with their food. I got the Havana daydreaming and it was AMAZING! And a coconut milk latte. I appreciated the milk alternative options  Overall, a great place!",

Wow. We have never been dissapointed in our experience and will continue to go back for more. Thank you to the great staff and management for keeping this establishment fun and enjoyable. If you havent visited it, you are missing out! See you soon Snooze on Ray!",

We had the breakfast pot pie- sausage was tasty but there just wasn't enough of it so it was just bland and the Bella Bella Benny- poached eggs were done to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was out of this world.  Surprisingly the coffee was pretty ordinary and weak.  Hip places like this typically have amazing coffee.  I will give this place another try and if I don't like my food choice again I'll just have a mimosa to make it all better!",

For some of the dishes, you choose your add-ins, and anything additional would be charged extra. However, we were told by the manager that their system \"automatically charges you for the more expensive item\" instead of including that as part of your original add-in. Add a $.75 veggie and they'll instead charge you for the $1.75 meat instead. Their receipts are vague so it's not explicitly written on there for what you've been upcharged.  This is the second time we've had to argue about this. Keep track of what your total amount should be before they give you the receipt. They'll refund you as \"pickle $\" but will tell you they'll \"only do it this once.\" I asked for this to be written on the menu so customers aren't misled, but they weren't very responsive to the idea.",

Food took about 20 minutes to arrive and when it finally arrived, plates slipped out of the servers arms and my orders fell flat on our table. Thank goodness I didn't get any food or beverages on me and the plate didn't break. Server was apologetic and we understand, things happen. Another server came and apologized, sat us at another table and made sure we were alright. I stated my concern that we will have to wait for another 20 or so minutes for our food to come out. She assured us that our order is priority and will be out soon. While waiting, another server came out ( I think a manager ) and advised that he heard what happened and apologize. He offered me something to eat while waiting for my meal. i asked for a bowl of fruits, and stated that my food will come out soon. Food came out, I loved the OMG French Toast - Yummy! Definitely must try!  Our bill came out and they only charged us for one meal. They didn't have to do that, but they did. Kudos to the management!  I will come back again and give it another try.",

Service: meh. The hostess was timely and personable. I like that there's a texting system to notify you of when your table is ready. Waitress could use a lesson from hostess on being personable. Also, I'm not a fan of servers who don't provide refills and bring the check without asking if you're ready for it.  Food:  Shhhhh.  Listen. Do you hear that? It's angels singing! Not only are they singing but they are also playing air guitar and head banging.  I had the Lox-n-Latke Benny, which gave me a taste-gasm. It was the perfect mix of salty and crispy and egg Benedict-y. Haha. Yw.  I also had regular cup of joe, which was ok. Then I tried the AM Manhattan....omg, the lead singer of the angel band just busted a high note! It's that awesome. The cherry on top of the drink made it a perfect balance of sweet and bitter.   The menu is pretty impressive! I do hope that whoever created and executed this menu is somewhere far away on a yacht enjoying the fruits of their creative labors, cuz they totally deserve it.   Prices are probably a dollar or two too high on the entrees, but since the food was so delish, I don't mind paying a little extra. I mean, angels sang, soooo.   Get in your car now, and go to Snooze. You'll be in heaven.",

I stopped by with the in-laws (the hubby was working, his loss), and though things were crazy busy, we were seated in 10 minutes. Our waitress was super helpful, knowing that it was our first time at Snooze, gave us a rundown of the menu, the crowd-pleasers as well as her personal favorites of each category before giving us a chance to peruse the menu. I settled on the benny duo (steak & eggs benny and the bella bella benny) while the mother-in-law got a blueberry danish pancake and the father-in-law got the shrimp and grits. Let's just say, nobody was left unsatisfied with their choice. Our waitress even sent us a complimentary cinnamon roll pancake which just blew our socks off and sealed the deal - we were coming back. I guess the hubby can come next time.",

Incredibly rich and creamy flavor on fluffy brioche toast, topped with coconut flakes, what tasted like coconut milk, and strawberries. Oh and you can't forget the powdered sugar!  The beauty of getting up and eating so early of course is the heat isn't quite blistering yet so having breakfast on the patio was a beautiful addition to the already warm staff & servers.   Loved every minute of it! Keep in mind portions are huge! Even if you come in hungry! Super cute restaurant and will definitely be coming back :)",

I chose their signature hash, and sampled their burrito and a blueberry danish pancake. Everything was tasty and of high quality. Maybe it was the fact that this was in Arizona, but the prices were very affordable for a brunch restaurant.   - Get here before 10AM.  - My hash was definitely True hash and not from a can ( unlike some other brunch places), portion may have been a bit small. - The kids pancakes were insanely delicious.  - Good coffee. - Uncomfortable butt-sliding retro chairs. - Recommended when visiting Phoenix.",

    "text": "Finally got in here! Came for Saturday brunch- didn't have a long wait. Both inside and outside are great places to be seated! First off our server was great. Got to us quickly picked up our drink requests and explained the menu as needed (check out the seasonal cocktails! Yum!). So many great options! I ended up getting the tofu scramble with my choice of three \"flavor savors\". My savors were of course veggies. My boyfriend stepped out of his box and got the Breakfast Pot Pie. For a meat eater it looked delicious. Warning on that item. If you are a traditionalist and thinking it will be a big plate of sausage and gravy it is not. It is gravy over a delicious puff pastry and an egg your style.   While we had a couple hiccups from the kitchen the server resolved them quickly and had our food back out in no time.   Tired of the standard, non creative breakfast menu? Come to Snooze. I very much recommend this place as one of the best places in Ahwatukee for breakfast.",

The girls at the bar were super sweet & made my bloody perfectly spicy, extra olives.  Thank you.  Snooze is a national treasure.  I love everything they do.  I opted for the duo of benedicts because that's how I brunch.  You should consider this as well, they are the best.  Smashed avocado & lox were the perfect start to my Saturday.  Me gusta.  My date somehow charmed his way into a free maple pecan pancake, which I inhaled because you don't turn down a free pancake.  Love this spot so much and looking forward to repeat visits.",

My only issue with Snooze is the wait time, especially when it's hot outside and everyone is crowding under the shade.",

    "text": "This is a well deserved five star review. Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic! Why? Read on...  Unheard of, but we had no wait time. Now, don't get me wrong, if there was an hour wait, it would be worth it, really! We sat right down in the super cool, hipster, comfortable, open, friendly atmosphere. Our server was super friendly and knowledgeable, outgoing, prompt and awesome! I was debating between two dishes and she immediately steered me in an incredibly delicious direction! She was in the money!  Food: it's surprising how good the food is here. When you think you've tasted just about everything and there isn't much new in breakfast cuisine to mix it up and happily surprise your pallet, this place will shock you with the most unique and delicious flavors of pancakes, eggs, breakfast meats, you name it. The food is super fresh, perfectly paired with spices and flavors, hearty, plentiful, beautifully prepared and served at the perfect temperature. The value is excellent for what you get. Might it be a couple dollars more than a standard breakfast chain? Yes, but truly worth every penny!   The \"Green Chili Eggs Benedict\" was one of the best breakfast I've had in years, honestly! As a creature of habit, I can't see why I wouldn't order that exact same thing for, well, the rest of my life! The True comfort food, \"grilled cheese and tomato soup\", was stellar! Two of the girls got the \"Ooh La La Frittata\" and it was outstanding! Clearly John loved his breakfast tacos because they were gone in less than three minutes! Of course, The second he looked like he was slowing down, Jackie invaded his plate and destroyed one herself, soo good :-) Mimosas and Bloody Marys were A delicious way to wash a couple dishes down.  Yes, there may be a wait for a table, there's a reason for it, this place is fantastic! I highly recommend it and am looking forward to returning, which I would do every morning over most other breakfast places without hesitation. Seriously, you should go put your name on the list right now, I hope you love it.",

I have been a handful of times and usually get the same thing: breakfast tacos on flour tortillas with chicken sausage and jalapenos added. The green chili hollandaise sauce is what makes the dish in my opinion.   Today my husband and I shared two smaller items since we weren't super hungry.   The breakfast pot pie: I first tried it years ago and it looks a little different now than it did then but still tastes great. I don't care for their hash browns, they aren't crispy enough.   Pancake of the day: sticky buns! The pancake was really tasty! Cinnamon swirled with cream cheese frosting, with chocolate chips throughout and it was so fluffy!  Our sever was kind and attentive. I don't like how long the wait is and how they blast the music but I think Snooze has become one of those \"party breakfast\" spots like Hash Kitchen.",

We got there right in time as there were people lined out the door waiting for tables when we left.   I'm more of a waffle girl but couldn't help but try out their pancake flight as they had unique flavors. I chose a carrot cake pancake, blueberry and lemon poppy seed pancakes for my flight. WOW! These pancakes were one of a kind, moist and I loved the browned butter. The lemon curd on the lemon poppy seed pancake was amazing.   On top of the food, their house-coffee is very good and they make an awesome chai tea latte. My BF had the breakfast pot pie and also loved it. New go-to breakfast spot when visiting Phoenix.",

Off to a slow start at the table since they were busy, but once our server got there she was on top of it and food came out quick! The menu is full of things you'll want to try making it hard to choose what to get (a good problem to have). The food was good, but no standout wow factor, just good but not great. That being said we are likely to come back and try some of the other menu items. Today I had the covered snooze spuds deluxe-good. Husband had the tofu scramble and didn't care for the texture (soggy). Daughter had French toast which was good. See pictures. Decor is cute and they have a nice patio area.",

However, the manager took the time to come by our table to not only apologize, but to also comp our order completely AND to give us a gift card to encourage us to come back. For a place that is not lacking business, they obviously value all their customers. Will definitely be returning for a second try. Thank you, Snooze.",

Ali has eaten at Snooze lots in San Diego and got us up early to drive 20 miles to get here. Oh my goodness. Clean and bright, with a very friendly hostess who sat us right away. We must of had lots of  luck that day because the people who came after us had to wait and when we left the line was about 30 people long. Our waiter  Chris ( I think that's his name short little guy of 6'5\") was at our table in less than 2 minutes.  He was wonderful  explained the menu and answered our questions. Coffee came next. Hot and delicious. Okay the food.  I had the pineapple upside down pancakes. Best pancake I ever had.  I want to go back soon the only problem is that because this resturant has such a following I need to get up at ungodly hour to get there early.",

Their menu is absolutely fantastic and the service is always wonderful. And did I mention how tasty their drinks are? If you love bloody Mary's, definitely give it a try. The Mimosa is very refreshing as well. I'm a huge fan of eggs Benedict and I love the fact that you can try to different types as an entree. That's what I did last year when I was here and that's what I did again this year when I was here. I wish I could eat here every weekend, that would be a dream come True!!! Can't wait to come back next year and have another amazing brunch! Until then your delicious eggs Benedict will be in my dreams!!!",

The environment is nice and decor is modern with lots of orange!!!!  Our waitress was really nice and helpful. My friend got the shrimp and grits while I opted for the egg white omelet with bacon, cheese, peppers, and pico de Gallo with an English muffin with strawberry jelly. My friend also ordered a mimosa.  The waitress recommended the Fallin and my bestie really liked it.  I tasted my friend shrimp and it was really good and flavorful ( reminds me of New Orleans BBQ Shrimp)!! It was really good.  My dish was good also.. bacon makes everything right!!!

Benedict's are high quality and the presentation is nice.    They allow you to sub your sides for a sweet dish.    They are also an ethical restaurant.  A lot of locally sourced ingredients.  Plus they support a lot of nonprofits and charities.    Note there are long waits during weekends, which isn't abnormal for any good brunch spot in America.   However, this place is horrible at turning tables over.  You will be waiting for a table and will notice at least 5 or tables that no one is sitting at.  On the bright side at least they give you free coffee while you wait.  If you are short on time this isn't the place to go.    Bathrooms are clean, so that's a good sign that the kitchen is clean.",

Multiple servers  walked by, not even a hello. We read over the menu and then put it away, as a sign that we're ready to order. Yet the party after us was greeted and seated with their server present. We were still waiting, can we at least be offered some water??? It's not like it was crazy busy, it was steady.  So after another 5 min of waiting we got up and left. Same hostess saw us leaving and just looked the other way. No bye, everything okay?, or have a good day.  So, we just walked next door to Modern Market. What a difference! Service and food. :)",

My niece was torn between the ham benedict and the pineapple upside down pancake - imagine her delight when she found you could substitute a pancake for the potatoes!    I tried the Rueben sandwich and the corn beef was moist and downright yummy!  This was the first time that I found the potato casserole to be spiced not to my liking - I couldn't quite identify what it was.   Next time, I will substitute a side salad.    Definitely back on my list!",

I probably should have ordered the large special cinnamon white chocolate chip pancake, but I got a flight of pancakes with a French toast. Pancakes however were dry. Food is sweet but standard.

This is the only place I will order pancakes or hash browns from. Every other breakfast place the pancakes and hash browns are so bland, dry and boring unless you add syrup or ketchup... ugh. But at Snooze, oh man, it's a whole other world of experiencing breakfast. They make buttery, sweet pancakes and hash browns that are properly seasoned, it's so good!! Their egg benedict's are fantastic and I love getting a flight of pancakes and trying different flavors. You can't go wrong with any Snooze restaurants. Oh, and on your birthday if you let them know, they'll send you a rainbow colored, donut shaped pancake with a candle!",

On top of the pot pie you can have it topped with an egg of your liking. Typically I get over easy because I love it when the yolk is runny. I got hash browns on the side... extra crispy.

A few friends and I came in on a Saturday morning and it was packed. We were told it'd be 15 minutes and we ended up waiting 30. We understood because it was so busy. We had a very sweet server but a few things got forgotten. My friend ordered a Bloody Mary with bacon and didn't receive the bacon. I ordered a side of fruit with my meal that I didn't receive but was charged for as well. I ordered the spring has sprung frittata. It lacked a lot of flavor and needed hot sauce and salt, I probably wouldn't order it again. A friends orders got a little mixed up, they ordered the same dish, one was gluten free and the other had no cheese but it was no biggie. I think that since this place just got up and running it's just a bit slow and unorganized at this point. I will probably come again in a few months to try it out again. My friend got the green Bloody Mary and only said good things! As for right now I'll stick to the Tempe location. I",

    "text": "I have always been a fan of Snooze but this location is so much better than all the rest!  Snooze is the happening place for brunch that brings a twist on traditional breakfast staples and adds a retro flair to it's decor. From the eggs Benedict that takes a twist to incorporate lox with caper relish to a sausage gravy stuffed pot pie, there is something for everyone!  We went here on Saturday and hour before they were closing. They were quick to help us and put our names down. They use a texting system to help alert you once your table is ready. They placed a few chairs outside to sit and wait, in which we only waited 10 minutes which is an all time record for us when we go to Snooze.   Let me tell you the pros of this location: - Tons of free parking! Thats right! No meters, and lots of free space to park, sign me up! - The inside is huge, many other locations are confined by smaller buildings but this location was large and offered tons of booths for patrons to sit at. - Quick staff, the fastest service I have ever received at a Snooze.  The staff was friendly and took care of us right away. I ordered the pot pie which used a flaky pastry crust, stuffed with country gravy, sausage and you typical pot pie fix-ins. The top was adorned with an egg that I ordered over Easy. Instead of hash browns, I ordered the pancake instead for a 4 dollar up charge. The best part, you can get any pancake, so I ordered the Pumpkin bourbon pancake and oh my goodness, it was perfection. The pancake had a sweet butter on top, with a cream cheese type of sauce drizzle along with bourbon syrup and tons of yummy nuts. My husband and I split this because it was huge. We loved it! Too bad it's seasonal, so get it while you can. My pastry was amazing, the flavors somehow blended perfectly and was not too heavy. I'd highly recommend if you want something different. Lastly my husband ordered the lox Eggs Benedict. I love the caper relish they put on top and the sauce is delicious.  We received our food in 10 minutes from ordering which was fantastic as I was starving. Overall, this location is definitely my favorite. The decor is a little more bland but this place knows how to move fast and make amazing food every time. Hope to see you at Brunch!",

Love that they offer coffee while you wait...one suggestion: have somebody in charge of the station so things stay full.  We initially came up to an empty coffee pot and empty creamer container but things were refilled immediately upon saying something.  Love the interior; very chic!  We were served by Hayatt, who is efficient but running, running, running!  Took a few minutes to get her to warm up but once she did, she was personable and even gave us hugs when we were leaving.    I had a side, plain pancake and an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and jack cheese.  Partner had the Snooze Classic with the pulled pork.  OMG...the pork was fabulous!  We loved the flavor of it.  The potatoes are great too, although next time we will ask for a bit more crispy.    Overall, a 5-star experience.  We even had a visit with the General Manager who stopped by.  Yes...most likely you will have a wait when going but so worth it!!!  Can't wait to try other things on the menu!",

Well, since they opened one in ahwatukee, I decided to give it shot since I didn't have to travel far haha. I got the duo benny with their original eggs Benedict and the green chile eggs benedict with barbacoa. Their original had a smoked cheddar hollandaise which was so GOOD!!! The barbacoa on the other benny was DELICIOUS! Also, their hasbrowns are also some of the best I've eaten. They almost had a sour cream and onion taste and it was presented so nicely, I would go back just for those alone! The only reason why I didn't give 4 stars was because my food didn't seem very warm when I got it, like maybe it had been sitting there for a bit before it came out to me, and some sides we ordered were forgotten. BUT I will definitely be back!",

Anyway, we came this week at lunch and was seated after they needed to clean a table.  This was about 12 noon and I asked why the section next to us was closed off thought maybe they had a party.  Could have been seated there quicker since the tables were clean.  To my surprise they said they close off sections as it gets close to closing, sounds like a poor excuse to me.  Maybe a ploy to make it seem busier than  it was.  Anyway, the table next to us came in about the same time.  We ordered our water which seem to take way to long to retrieve.  We placed our order and the partner make a special request as to the type of cheese but nothing special on my end except that I asked for the eggs over easy.  After what seemed like 30 minutes the waitress came back and said there was a mistake with the preparation regarding the cheese and they would correct it so it would take just a few minutes more.  By the time our order had come out the table next to us had already left and to my surprise the eggs were scrambled.  The waitress she would bring out the the correct eggs.  As I took a bite I knew my order had sat for awhile as my partners order was  being fixed since the first bite was cold.  And quicker than a flash they brought out the over easy but way too runny eggs.  Suffice it to say I didn't finish the eggs scrambled or over runny.  I really want this placed to be good but we just can't get past the poor service.  Luckily the manager in charge comped the meal.",

I had heard good things about the food and love a good breakfast place, so was super excited to have one open near our house. The first time we went out server was not great. The restaurant was busy, but he never even came over to our table until we had to ask the hostess where he was. Even after that, he was pretty absent and we had to ask repeatedly for things like drink refills, condiments, etc. I am giving Snooze 4 stars partly because the food was pretty good, but more importantly because one of the other wait staff, Sydni, was very friendly and helpful, even though we weren't sitting at her table. She went out of her way to come visit with our baby, refill our waters when she saw they were empty, and basically make up for the lack of service from the other employee. Since that visit, we have been back and had a better experience, but we definitely would not have been back a second time if it were not for her.",

    "text": "So the food was good.  Unfortunately, it stops there--this is where the 3 stars come from.  Considering people have been raving about this place, I really expected good food, good service, and a great environment.  The food was good.  I had the pancake flight and ..well, genius--I loved the variety.  Now, admittedly we walked in having all crawled out of bed on the holiday today.  Fortunately, we didn't have a wait and we were seated right away since it was about an hour before closing.  Unlike my motley group, our server Sydni was very presentable.  Unfortunately, she was also somewhat inattentive, forgetful, and a little awkward (e.g. I asked about getting some syrup for my pancakes and she replied \"not normally\"...she did bring it, but she forgot for the first while and I was already 1/3 done my food once it arrived...she asked us early on if we wanted ketchup and hot sauce and we said \"yes\" but then she never brought them...)    Now here's what seals the deal on us not returning--two issues here.  Firstly--When we came in, the music was so loud it was actually uncomfortable.  We were seated next to a large group of ~10 people, including kids, and between the table next to us and the music...we couldn't actually hear one another speaking.  People in the restaurant were clearly all competing with the music and it really escalated the noise level in there.  Secondly--the drinks here are problematic.  My daughter asked about getting Sprite and was told that they don't have any but they do have a Mexican version.  Ok--she didn't want that so she said \"can I just get a Coke then?\"  She was brought the Mexican version still and didn't like it--she barely even took a sip out of it.  Then, I asked for a diet Coke and was brought a cup full of ice with about 30ml of soda poured over it to generate some watery tasteless liquid.  Three sips and it was gone.  Refill was much the same--another three sips.  When I asked for a third, I was told I would be charged again.  So I paid $5 for about 100-120ml of watered down generic soda.  In a world of free refills...this has me eating at the competition.  Further, Sydni needed some prompting on providing us straws.  Oh and the water refills?  You'd think she was paying out of pocket for the water--those cups sat empty for most of our meal.  So Snooze...between the soda situation, the noise, and poor service...I'm headed back to my regular breakfast haunt up on Elliott near Priest.  You know the one.  When you start to hire based on experience and ability, resolve the refill issue (or at least stop padding your drinks with all ice), and turn down the music...let me know, because your food is genuinely good and I really want to like you.",

    "text": "I came in here today with a friend of mine to grab some breakfast. So we wait about 10 min to get seated and we start looking for our order. We decide, and put the order in. Not more than 20 second, no exaggeration, later I ask the waitress if I could change my order because I was kind of rushed in picking and changed my mind. No big deal right? Happens all the time. She says they couldn't change the order because she had already put it in. So, obviously annoyed that I would not enjoy the meal I would pay for, accepted this. My friend who was with me has been a server for about 5 years and said there's no reason why she shouldn't switch my order for what I truly want. So I ask a different waitress and she says the same thing, but says she will put in my new order. The food took around 35 min to come out, even though the only reason she said I could not change my order was because they start making it immediately which was obviously a lie, and the original food order comes out. I was so confused but around 10 min later my new order comes out, and I send the original plate back untouched with the woman who brought out my new food. So the bill comes and she had charged me for both meals! I call her over saying I would not pay for something I didn't eat, especially after the horrible service. So she just walks away, another server comes up accusing us of putting the food in my friends to go box as if we were trying to get a free meal. Like no hun, we were just not paying for food we didn't eat. She said \"well that's how this restaurant works for future notice\" in a very rude way. Needless to say, we will never come back here after the horrible service from multiple servers. For being new in the area, they should really be making a better impression.",
