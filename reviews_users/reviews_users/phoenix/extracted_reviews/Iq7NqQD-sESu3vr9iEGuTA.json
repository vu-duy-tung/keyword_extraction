My boyfriend and I both ordered the Mexicana omelette and a side of wild berry stuffed crepes. The fresh squeezed OJ is to die for. The omelet were so light and fluffy, stuffed with. Chorizo, avocado,onion, cheddar cheese and topped with green chile sauce...delicious'nnWe generally eat light and small meals, but we devoured our breakfast. Totally recommend",

    "text": "Having read the reviews prior to coming we were well aware there would be a wait. In addition we had a group of 6 so we expected the wait to be awhile. We arrived shortly before 11am on a sunday and were told that the wait would be 45 minutes. We had a nice chat outside and were seated just before 1130.   Previous reviewers mentioned the coffee was the best they'd every had so i ordered the coffee. The coffee was good but my cup was only refilled once and sat empty for a little bit.   I ordered the New Mexico Skillet after being scared away from the omelttes( saw one delivered to a nearby table and while it looked delicious the thing was huge. I could not have eaten it by myself). Food was delivered quicker than we expected and was definitely some of the better breakfast food I've had in a while. Most dishes were very reasonably priced.   We'll probably come back but it will likely be a while. Other breakfast places are close to as good and often have shorter wait times.",

Nice buzzing atmosphere! The tables turn pretty quickly so after waiting a bit we were seated. We already knew what we wanted to order since we looked at the menu when we were waiting, so we ordered straight away after we got our drinks. And boy!! The food came out so quick!! The portions are amazingggg. I ordered the California scramble with hash browns and wild berry pancakes. My friend customized his omelette with hash browns and banana creme pancakes. These pancakes are the real deal. They are up there on my list of some of the best pancakes I've had. Flavorful and fluffy. Everything was on point. I just wish I had a larger stomach to fit everything!! Will definitely recommend!! Hope to return soon : ) also want to shout out to the staff, they are friendly, attentive, and working hard!",

Belgium waffles cooked with perfect combination of crispy outside with moist center topped off with there signature \"Butters\" syrup.  It is clear why there is always a long wait on weekends.  Our waitress very cordial and aware of her table and cleanliness of the table.  There was little spillage from our orange juice and she quickly alerted another wait staff to help clean our table.  She came to check on us twice.  (Once is considered standard).  The decor is Clean and modern and impressive.  On a first impression Butters delivers a strong showing on what is basic of American breakfast staple.  I would have to go again to check on consistency.",

    "text": "Great breakfast place! It's actually right down the street from where I live, so I can walk there, fill up, and then walk off everything I just ate! It's conveniently located on Hayden in the Greenbelt area, so there are lots of bike paths and wide sidewalks for families - and right near the lakes too, so you can make a great weekend morning out of going here.  Butters is part of Butterfields, so if you're familiar with their menu and service, you'll probably see the similarities. Butters does have a different sort of ambience - a bit more modern, rather than down home and cozy like Butterfields. But equally clean, with fast and friendly service and most importantly the food and presentation is fabulous. I always go for their egg white omlettes, always fluffy and healthy and lots of different side options. One of my faves though is their french toast - if I wanna indulge in something delicious, a feast for my eyes and stomach, I definitely go for their french toast.  Gotta give it a try - there's no other breakfast place I'd go to - except their sister restaurant Butterfields!  EDIT: 8/22/2014  Upped it to 5 stars because I've been here enough times as well as other breakfast places to say that this is definitely my fave. Fast service, consistent food, always delicious, friendly, and I could go on.",

I was not sure if it was until I looked on the Butterfields website. Butterfields is good but Butters is better!!! I had the Wildberry (Blueberry) Pancakes. They came with a ton of fruit which was really good to eat the pancakes with. I also tried the hashbrowns and while I would not call them hashbrowns they were still really good!! They were cut the shape of scalloped potatoes (round) but were thin and fried nicely to have a crunch.. Mmm overall a really good place!! Also, the portions are pretty big.",

    "text": "I went here for a late Sunday brunch. I'm not often in the North Scottsdale area, but my boyfriend & I wanted to find a new place to have brunch so we decided to go up there before visiting the Musical Instrument Museum.   We got there around 1:15 and was told it would be a 15 minute wait..well, it turned into about 30, which was kind of annoying but thankfully since they gave us a menu we knew exactly what we wanted to order when we were finally seated.   I ordered the Eggs Verde, which is corn tortillas topped with black beans, cheese, eggs and salsa verde and it was supposed to come with hash browns. My boyfriend ordered ham and eggs with pancakes and hash browns. Shortly after ordering, the waitress indicated that they didn't have hash browns for my order so I opted to order fruit with mine. When our orders arrived, he had hash browns? It was a bit confusing...I'm not sure how you could run out of a breakfast staple such as potatoes?   Our food was ready quite quickly and it was really delicious. I really enjoy Mexican breakfast food in general and was not disappointed. I even stole a bite of my boyfriend's pancakes and they were very tasty. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. Overall it's a great breakfast spot with a variety of options to choose from.  I wish I could give it a solid 4 stars, although with the unexpected 30 minute wait and hash brown mystery I cannot. I'd be willing to check this restaurant out again though, if I'm ever up in North Scottsdale again.",

    "text": "I found out about Butters on the weekly Yelp emails and had to go check them out. I'm not often in the area, but if we're even remotely close by I'll make sure to go.   It's a cute place- accessible and service tends to be great. They seat you quickly, in spite of a crowd that collects during peak hours. Really nice large, shaded patio. Keep in mind I've only gone there either by myself of with my husband though, so it's not as if they're trying to accommodate huge groups that show up at the last minute.   I'm rating this place 3.5 stars rounded down to 3. It's solid, with a good brunch selection that is also great about catering to you if you're attempting to eat healthier. I've always subbed out my eggs for egg whites, and taste and flavor isn't compromised in the least. I've had the scrambled eggs with salmon, and built my own omelette as well. Their grits deserve an extra special mention- creamy and smooth and silky. I don't know that the cheese is really that much more awesome than the plain, it's just that good. Their bacon is also really great.   It's a good stand by for when you want brunch. If I lived in the area I'd be a lot more regular. It's no cutting edge, creative brunch place, but the stuff that they do make is always on point, and is very good. Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "We dined here on a Sunday morning with a wait time of about 45 minutes. We walked around the lake next to the restaurant which makes it a great location for kids. When we arrived back to Butters after our notification we had a little trouble because they put us down as 4 with 1 kid and we had told them we had 2 kids. The hostess handled it rudely but luckily we just had to wait a few more minutes before we got sat. As for the food, I got the Mexicana Omelette, and did indeed love the chorizo, but the ratio of egg to filling was quite low. Come to think of it, I don't recall avocado or cheese in the omelette. The green chili has a lot of potential, but they barely skim the top of the omelette with it, so the flavor was minimal.  So, I did ask for an extra side of green chili to put on the second half of my omelette and to give the bland \"hash browns\" some flavor. We upgraded the pancake side to the Oreo one, that was good, but truly just some toppings on normal pancakes. Coffee was a smooth taste and the servers did a good job keeping it flowing and checking in with us. Other people in the party got the Popeye Scramble, Whole Hog Skillet and Countryside Benedict - they were leaning closer to a 4 star rating. Overall, I am going with a 3.",

I usually do not like eggs at restaurants but Butters are always cooked to perfection. The scrambled eggs are fluffy (fluffy is a good think in my opinion) & taste great.   Try the berry bliss pancakes or French toast, & the banana nut bread French toast is different but in a really good way.  Obviously, I highly recommend this place. Just go before 8 & beat the crowds.",

Oh and the buttermilk pancakes (comes with the two egg plate) are out of this world.

I love their Eggs Benedict Wildberry Bliss Crepes, and Popeye Scrambler! And here's another tip, ask for protein pancakes and get ready for your life to change forever! Everything here is good, from the coffee, fresh squeezed juice, and the service.   Service here has consistently been five stars for me. I've always had great, quick, friendly servers who get the order correct the first time and always anticipate everything we're going to need. They offer all kinds of sauces, Tabasco, syrup for the pancakes everything you could possibly need! Did I mention the food comes out so fast! So if you have a slow friend it's OK to let them order after you because their food will be out just as fast lol! I've even noticed the quality of the bussers. They're always coming by to clear unused plates and make room for you on the table and are also very friendly. I consistently hear other patrons asking to speak to the manager-normally this would be a scary thing for a server but every time the customer comments on how good of an experience they had and I 100% agree. This will be my breakfast spot for life!",

While brunchy-Scottsdale tends to wake up a bit later, we just couldn't wait on the late-birds; we were famished. We arrived just before 8 AM but already found the waiting crowds outside. Fortunately, despite the appearance, the wait for a table for 2 was only about 10 minutes. But a wait outside in the Arizona sun, even at 8 AM, can be quite a sweaty wait.  Once we were seated, we already had decided on our selections. The service is hear is incredibly fast; coffee served immediately and entrees within 5 minutes. I ordered the egg whites, turkey bacon, and hash browns along with their famous wildberry pancakes on the side.The amount of food was a bit daunting but I brought my appetite. The egg whites were nice and fluffy and the thick-sliced hash browns were a nice texture to me. The turkey bacon wasn't much to write about but turkey bacon usually isn't exciting. The wildberry pancakes were delicious but more like a dessert than breakfast. But I supposed that's the point? Overall the food was quite good.  The service here is polite but to the point. Don't expect chatty servers as they are working through big crowds and lots of tables. I think the food makes Butters so popular with it's well done sweet & traditional breakfast plates. Glad we stopped in here and would certainly return!",

We tried pretty much everything on the menu: skillet was fresh ingredients with eggs your way, egg whites just as fluffy, waffle (crunchy on outside), biscuits and gravy was perfection. Hash browns are different than anything we've tasted. Fresh OJ and Grapefrut juice. Our server Regina was so nice!  Exceptional in every way. Go here!!!",

For fancier options try any of their eggs benedict options. Terrific.  The protein power cakes and delicious!!!  The coffee. Best non-coffee shop black coffee for a dine-in breakfast joint in the area. Great compliment to the great service!",

Though there were more than 5 tables available when we arrived, we were told until all of the party of 6 arrived we could not be seated. Over about 10 minutes we went from 1 to 4 to 5 and then finally to 6. When all of arrived, no tables had been left next to each other so that we could be seated though there were still 4 or 5 left open. Parties of 1 and 2 had come in and a few had left but at no time did the hostess and head hostess give consideration to the party of 6 building in the small entry area. We were ordered, not asked, to move to the corner and wait until we could be accommodated. When the failure to plan was pointed out, the head hostess reiterated that THEIR way of doing business was not to seat anyone until the whole party arrived. With that we took our business elsewhere.",

We both got the wildberry bliss items but I got French toast (highly highly recommend) and he got the pancakes. The French toast was so thick and delicious and the vanilla cream in the middle with berries on the side was just so indulgent and delicious. Hubby ate his pancakes with maple syrup which is definitely good, but I think it's fine without syrup which is how I enjoyed mine.  We also recommend the thick cut applewood smoked bacon because it was really yummy and the hash browns  are sooooo tasty! I think that was my favorite thing? Instead of the criss- cross style at most places this was just potatoes cut into thin slices and fried. They were very tasty. They asked if we wanted to add cheese or onions - we didn't- but I imagine doing so would be very tasty as well!  There is also a coffee and juice bar near the front where you can order a drink while waiting to be seated which is a great touch especially if you have a while to wait.  Lastly the aesthetic of the building is just really chic and modern. We enjoyed our meal and atmosphere!",

You can be grazed by people walking by if you are seated at a single table in the center of the room,  or be shoved at a table in between two others.

But dang it all, these are big, thick and fluffy pillows of goodness. I am happy I had the plain pancake to gauge the deliciousness of them. Even though it was hard to make the decision because they have some insanely delicious options, such as an Oreo pancake.  What is even better is that it came with the omelette I had ordered. Which not to detract from the awesomeness of their pancakes... But their omelettes are amazing as well. They are about three inches thick. I believe they have to add some of their amazing pancake batter to the mix to make their omelettes so thick and fluffy because I think they were standard three egg omelettes. Maybe I am wrong, but who cares because they are so delicious. This place even blends their own cheeses to ensure quality!   Love at first bite!",

It definitely looked like the place that catered to everyone, but definitely not a fancy sit down.  They had a pretty diverse menu, and I was pleasantly surprised that their pancake menu had so menu options! We finally had decided on the wild berry bliss pancakes because the waiter said that and the cinnamon roll pancakes were the most popular, and I don't regret my decision at all! Sure the pancakes looks like regular pancakes, but these pancakes are really well made. They weren't overly sweet, had a nice fluff to them and not dense, and also had a nice selection of berries and cream (and of course with the option to top it off with some syrup). It was very enjoyable and tasty. We also got hash browns to go with the sweetness, but they are just general hash browns that you can get anywhere.  I definitely see myself coming here again and trying their other food! This is a great place if you and/or your party can't decide on a brunch place because this places seems to have everything. I don't regret ordering the wild berry bliss pancakes at all :)",

Butters pancakes has raving reviews, but I have to admit my expectations weren't too high when I saw the family diner-esque vibe. No mimosas, really??  We ordered the wild berry bliss pancakes and a side of hash browns, which both came out fairly quickly. The pancakes look pretty ordinary at first glance, but one bite in and I was in love. They're light, airy, not overly sweet, and still have that scrumptious taste of blueberries and cream. Top if off with some syrup and you're golden. The hash browns were alright, I wish they had tater tots.   The menu is pretty expansive - they have lots of pancake options ranging from chocolate chip to fully decked Oreo pancakes. They've also got an extensive savory foods menu if you'd rather not eat diabetes for breakfast.   I would recommend this place to others and would also return in the future to try out some more dishes. I liked it more than Snooze, which I feel is an over-hyped chain.",

I think we were called within 25 minutes and taken to our seat.   The service here is efficient! Right away we had our coffee poured and chatted with the attentive server.  My boyfriend ordered the Santa Fe Skillet and I had a spinach and feta omelette (with a side of wheat pancakes, of course). Everything was out of the kitchen in under 10 minutes. The eggs were perfect and the pancakes were wonderfully fluffed. Definitely a lot of food for one person - the portions are huge.   I'd definitely come back!

    "text": "WOW!!! This place was amazing. I would definitely come back if I come through Arizona again.   PARKING: very ample lot  SERVICE: friendly and efficient, food came out in a decent amount of time  AMBIENCE: this place was packed of people of all ages! Really homey place and very fun. We had to wait about 40 minutes but there was a coffee shop next door we just waited in!  FOOD: I got the Wildberry French Toast (-$10) which was 2 pieces of brioche stuffed with marscapone and covered in a glaze and then served with strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Very sweet but good! I didn't like the glaze that much because somehow it tasted a little sour, but I thought the portion size was pretty generous (I was only able to eat about half).  My friend got the Mexican omelette which was really good, and my other friends got the garden scrambles over hash browns (delicious). I tried the protein pancakes which I enjoyed as well!  The bulk of the food was really tasty and I think if I came back I might opt for one of the banana French toasts just because the Wildberry one had this weird sour note to it. Overall though, very impressed :)",

I've also noticed that parties listed below ours were seated before us, which didn't make sense. We got really peeved about that.   Ambiance: Outside is way too hot during the summer. Inside is very loud and table are close together.   Service: Our waitress the first time around was average. The second time we came, our waitress was energetic and made the long 50 minute wait worth while.   Food: I recommend getting a skillet and getting a premium pancake as a side. The prices are fairly priced, considering the amount of food you get. The pancakes are soft and made with butter. The oreo s'mores is definitely a sweet tooth. The butter cream is also good. Overall, anything on the menu is great. The food is the True reason we'll keep coming back.   Overall, I would give a 5-star rating, but the wait time for sitting inside is way too long.",

Crispy bacon, amazing hash browns and the butteriest buttermilk pancakes! The banana french toast was also delicious. Even though it was insanely busy for Mother's Day, our waitress was attentive and our food came out quick! Definitely recommend!",

I'm a fan of surprise tastes, something unique, an unusual flavor even if it's small differences. You don't get that here.

The OJ is amazing (you can see them making it at the coffee bar) and all of our egg dishes were fluffy and delicious. The hashbrowns were cooked like scallop country-style homefries...BOMB.

I am one of those annoying people that modifies menu items because I don't like some things that are standard to some dishes.  i.e.  avocado, sour cream, some cheeses, mayonnaise, and the list goes on...so I was not a very happy camper when I was told it was a $0.25 charge to substitute anything.

When we were seated, the waitress came over immediately and got us our coffee and orange juice. There was a carafe of ice water on the table. Coffee was good. OJ was fresh squeezed. I ordered an omelet with hash browns and pancakes - all very good! Our food was served quickly and the service was attentive. Very impressive considering how busy the place was! And since it was it Scottsdale, there were a lot of 40 and 50 something women patrons with big ol' fake fun bags (if you are into that sort of thing)! All in all a very good place for breakfast if you don't mind a bit of a wait!",

    "text": "The Wildberry Bliss pancakes were in fact blissful.  Even without syrup, the vanilla mascarpone and vanilla cream really made the dish.  When we order pancakes and a savory dish for breakfast, I usually only partake of a few bites.  However, I almost finished off my pancakes this time.  I also liked that they carried coffee from the local and esteemed Passport coffee.  Usually most breakfast places carry half-rate coffee, but at Butters you could get your great coffee with your breakfast.  The New Mexico Skillet didn't come in a skillet and wasn't doing much for me.  It didn't seem to have all of the ingredients that were listed on the write-up either.  I was wanting some sauce too.  Oh well, I was enamored enough with the pancakes that that was okay.  My husband was pleased with his Eggs Rojo.  The rojo sauce was almost like a smoky enchilada sauce and was very flavorful.  I was a little disappointed when I asked for a side of salsa for my egg dish and not only was it extra but it looked like plain Pace sauce that I used to get growing up.  Yuck.  Anyways, overall, I would still say with the originality of the entrees, the superb pancakes, and the high quality coffee, I would still give the place high ratings.",

    "text": "I headed over after staying in Scottsdale for a holiday party the night before - I was exhausted and I practically looked like I rolled out of bed so not a pretty sight.  I was starving and I found this place on yelp.  I was so excited to try a new place out because I don't try new places very much.  As we park and start walking to the restaurant, we see a big window looking into the restaurant and two or three young ladies scrutnizing me and my bf as if they are talking about us.  I wanted to say, \"Yes, I know.  I'm short, he's tall and I look like $hit!\" Well, at least I think that's what they are saying on the other side of the wall.  When we walk in, they seat us right away.  The restaurant was not busy at all so that was nice.  I ordered the corn beef hash skillet with pancakes and a side of bacon.  The corn beef hash was delightful - it had the perfect crunch and lot sof cheese. mmmm cheese!  Pancakes were light and fluffy, but the applewood bacon was not good. At all. I advise to not order it.  I eat bacon all the time.  If I can eat bacon everyday and not feel guilty about it, I would.  I like em crunchy, hot and full of goodness.  Their bacon was chewy, cool, and it didn't taste like bacon. It just tasted like fried oil.  I told the waitress I was not feeling the bacon and it was such an awkward moment for me. She asked me what I wanted to do and I asked her if I can just get a fresh plate.  She took the plate and came back with a fresh plate and that too tasted like the last. I then just proceeded to eat my corn beef hash to get rid of that taste in my mouth.    The bill came and the waitress was kind enough to take the bacon off the bill. For two people, the check came to approximately $25 with tip. Totally a \"go-to\" spot if you are in Scottsdale. Just don't get the bacon.",

I ordered the Country \"Benny\" and it was a biscuit with a huge sausage patty on each side, a perfectly poached egg on each patty, and the whole thing was covered in country gravy!! I was wondering where the hollandaise sauce was since it was a benedict, but I was perfectly happy with the gravy. I also had the grits (came with it), and they were the fluffiest grits I've ever had.   One of my friends ordered the baked potato eggs and the other the belgian waffle. They both were very happy with their choices, as was I. The food was delicious, the service was spot-on friendly, and we decided to go back before I went back to California. This time two of us had the pancakes, and they were perfectly sized, light and fluffy, and absolutely delicious!!!  The highlight of this trip was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time, and then enjoying a wonderful breakfast with my friends!",

    "text": "The positive things you've read about Butters' food on Yelp are all True. The pancakes are great! Light and fluffy. My favorite in the Valley, except perhaps for the unique lemon enhanced cakes at The Original Breakfast House. Omelets? \"This is the best omelet I've had in ages,\" was the comment about the Mexicana Omelet during our most recent visit. The Garden Skillet? Solid. Mickey Mouse kids meal? Perfect. Even simple scrambled eggs are uniquely well prepared. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and the coffee is enjoyable black.  The \"children's brunch\" menu is basic; in other words, just what kids want. Reasonably priced. One cautionary comment: There are no special sizes or prices for kid drinks. You can accidentally double the price of your child's meal if you aren't paying attention.   So why not five stars? Nothing related to the food. Success, however, can create issues. Don't come here on a Saturday or Sunday morning unless you have some time to kill. They do a good job churning the customers, but given the choice I'd rather not be churned. Or feel so cramped. Our recent Sunday morning wait was shorter than promised, but once seated we had to wait for quite a while before being offered coffee, inexcusable for a breakfast joint. I like my coffee black and Butters' coffee does not disappoint. Others in our party who like to self-doctor their java, however, were not as happy. The only tool available was plain cream. Butters does serve vanilla lattes and the like, which was not pointed out by our waitress when an initial ordering inquiry was made about the availability of flavored creamers. An oversight, given that a vanilla latte would have definitely been preferred.   We were seated indoors and the ventilation in our area was less than adequate. It's hard to enjoy your hot coffee when you are perspiring. Finally, our credit card payment was mixed up with another table. While apologetically corrected, it is the type of thing that happens when a restaurant is operating beyond full capacity.  I love Butters. I just need to avoid Sunday mornings there.",

    "text": "Not for large groups. Went for breakfast on Sunday, May 20th with family to celebrate daughter's graduation.  I called ahead to inquire about getting a reservation for our large group (10) or to see if there was a wait list to get on before arriving.  Was told there was a list, but that at least one person of your group had to be there to be on it. (? what is the point of having a \"list\" then).  Decided to go anyway and plan to wait.  When we arrived was told the wait was 20 minutes, not bad for a Sunday morning.  However, ended up waiting 40 minutes while watching other guests get seated.  When I asked how much longer for our table, I was told they were setting it up in the back.  I took a peek to see, and there was nothing being set up.  Had another talk with the hostess, and the \"manager\" Ted stepped in and said our group had a longer wait because the other diners were small parties and they were waiting for tables to open up to seat us. I asked about why some of the smaller tables couldn't have been put together for us and was again told that they were small and unable to accommodate us unless we wanted to split up our group.  Finally did get seated and on our way to our table, noticed a similar sized  group at those \"smaller\" tables.    Food was good, service was good, but the tip was reflective of the poor customer service of the manager.  If this is the same guy that another reviewer wrote about, would recommend some re-training in hospitality.  He did not offer any apologies for the extended wait or once we were finally seated come by to see how our meal was.  I would not recommend this place for groups larger than 4.",

I think this especially True for Midwesterners. Butterfield's has branched out to create a hand full of locations in IL and AZ. No matter how many locations they have, IMO, the location on butterfield road back in IL will be their best. I won't eat my mom's pancakes but I'll eat the pancakes at the butterfields on butterfield road (sorry mom!). The other locations, including the one I'm supposedly reviewing, are lacking something the butterfield road location seemingly has mastered. Even the naperville, IL location is sub par. Hmm perhaps they should clone the cooks at the butterfield location in order to ensure a consistently tasty product.",

    "text": "Went with my 19 year old son for late breakfast today. Sadly, the food is delicious. It's everything else that ruined it! The waitress never cracked a smile and just seemed annoyed to even have to wait on us. We are about the friendliest people you could wait on so I have to believe she either doesn't like her job or just has a general over-all bad attitude. My son and I both ordered waffles. There was no syrup on the table so I asked her to bring some maple syrup with order. After she walked away we noticed that we were the only table without a bottle of syrup, so I grabbed a bottle from the table next to us. The waffles came, hot and delicious. When we got the check my son picked it up to look at it and he noticed that there was a charge of $1.75 for each of our little individual syrups that came with the waffle (which neither of us ended up using as we used the large bottle we had grabbed from the other table). When I asked the waitress about the charge she told me that \"we had ordered syrup\". I , of course said I had just asked for syrup ( not ordered) their \"gourmet\" syrup that I didn't even know about! She said she would have the manager take it off. She ended up sending some other employee over who insisted I had ordered syrup, which I guess translated into ordering their SPECIAL syrup. If you think this is sounding absurd, we're on the same page! I am the least picky or cheap person you could ever meet! It was 100% the principle! I even gave the lackluster waitress a 20% tip just because that's the kind of person I am! In the end, they took the charge off for one of the syrups because I had opened mine, but son hadn't. Mr. or Ms. Manager.....shame on you! In this day and age, the least we can expect when we have lots of dining options is to be treated as a valued customer! I'll be going back to Butterfields where there is good food and service with a smile!",

All three times I had the Popeye Scrambler.  It is GREAT.  However, they miss the mark in a few areas.  The hash browns were awful.  They tasted like powdered, instant potatoes.    The menu is the same as Butterfield's.  I asked the waitress how they are trying to be different and she said that they're aiming for a cafe feel.  However, they have no place for people to sit with laptops.  No bar at the coffee station.  Instead they packed as many tables as possible into the place and destroyed the energy.  It feels hectic, not calm like a cafe should.    Here comes the thunder.  The pancakes are AWFUL.  I would rate them a 2 out of 10.  They are gritty and are somewhere between tasteless and tasting bad.  I've had them three times and waited to write a review until I truly felt okay about writing something negative about a business in my neighborhood.  They advertise a product that they are terrible at.  The best pancakes in town are at JP Pancake up on Mountain View and Hayden, but everything else at JP Pancake sucks.  The best overall place for breakfast we have found is The Daily Dose on Scottsdale Rd. and Indian School.",

When spoken to her there was no expression or nice demeanor at all, you would think being a hostess you would put someone personable in that position. We had a party of 6 and sadly we were squeezed into the restaurant.  The place has too many tables you can't even move when you sit down. As for the food I order the classic Eggs Benedict, eggs were cooked perfectly, but overall still was blah, hash browns were under cooked.  Other people in our party had pancakes, which ended up being good, and another has an omelet, but how do you screw up an omelet. I don't have anything to say about the waitress, she was barely even seen, she took our order, and next time we saw her she brought the check.  Not sure why I even gave it 2 stars. We won't be going back there until they have new management or it changes companies. I would rather take the extra time and drive up the street to go and have some real breakfast at Tom's Thumb.",

ATMOSPHERE The atmosphere isn't anything special if you're looking for something that is super cute, I know that they are changing locations soon so maybe it'll be different!

The wait time is a bit of a bummer but worth it for sure if you have the time. A total local hangout not touristy and we loved that about it you get the real vibe of the people and everyone was great the service is fast and the food is great all around you can't go wrong... We totally found our new breakfast place when in Scottsdale Arizona we stayed at the Omni resort and the drive up there was not bad at all about 13 minutes or so. Prices are fair and portions are great much better then anything you will get at the hotel at double the price if you don't mind taking a quick ride, highly recommended don't let the wait scare you it moves pretty fast... Try it you will love it",

We were seated right away in a mostly empty dining room although by about 8am they were starting to fill up tables.  Our food was good, delivered fast and as ordered (well done).  I had scrambled eggs (fluffy!), sausage patties, hash browns & English muffin. My companion ordered a waffle and side of bacon.  There was enough food for at least 2 hungry people - took half home with me.  Our bill was around $25.  Server kept a good watch on us and returned for refills as appropriate.  I noticed they also serve FRESH squeezed oj with a machine up front (something to try on another visit!).  They have a lot of tables in their dining area and seem to be capable of seating a lot of guests in a rather small place.  The environment seemed rather fast-paced, not a place you would sit and linger long over a 2nd cup of coffee.  They also have a nice patio which I hope to try another time (weather did not permit during our visit).    I would definitely go back and maybe try lunch sometime.",

Their dinning area is very cramped, which makes extremely loud and hard to even hold a conversation. The food, the eggs seems processed and similar to Denny's. The pancakes also lacked authenticity and tasted very processed. The bananas on the pancakes and their bacon is all that tasted freshly made.   Along with the unhappy wait staff, the proceeded food, they have an unusual fly issue in their indoor dinning area. I literally couldn't go 20 seconds without swatting them away, I even killed one at my table leaving it as a souvenir for the bus staff.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this breakfast spot to anyone looking for authentic home style cooking experience.",

The place is usually slammed on the weekends but honestly it's worth the wait, grab a coffee and relax in the usually insanely perfect Arizona weather.   I got their Corned Beef hash skillet which was super good - it came with hash browns, jack and cheddar cheese and 2 eggs of my choice. It's served with Pancakes or toast, I ordered the pancake which I was thrilled about because the pancake was perfection!   My friend got the eggs verde which was corn tortilla, black beans, jack cheese, 2 eggs (any style), and topped with green new mexico chile sauce. Served with hash browns or grits. They were super thrilled with their selection as well.   Coffee was good and they have fresh squeezed OJ as well!  Def worth a visit if your looking for some solid breakfast food!",

Makes it easier to fill when needed and not have to wait for a waiter.   The food is amazing. You can eat here whether you are a health freak or a down right dirty eater. Either way, your meal comes with plenty of food. California Scrambler is amazing as is the Fresh Strawberry French Toast. They also serve freshly squeeze orange juice. Real orange juice!!! Prehaps a bit expensive for the orange juice but it is worth it if you like orange juice.  Definitely worth the drive.",

    "text": "Butters Pancakes? Instantly, I pulled up my Cardiologist's phone number just in case! Now this was a classic bookmarked place on Yelp that I finally got around to visiting. We had a slight wait of 15 minutes, which isn't bad at all with the amount of people waiting. Things I loved:  1. Orange Juice - Very fresh and would be even better with some Kettle One 2. Food - Had the breakfast burrito w/ chorizo (checked again to make sure my doc was on speed dial) Very good with the somewhat crispy butter potato hashbrowns.  3. Service - This place would have totally gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the odd service. One of the people we went with received his order, but there was an extra egg (he didn't even notice until she came over). She had the cojones to take his plate away well after he started eating because it was meant for another table. She didn't apologize and actually made him feel like it was his fault. He stopped her saying he had already started eating and it was too late. Very odd to say the least.  Overall, we had a good experience and will possibly try it again when we're in the area. Maybe sneak in some Kettle One! Shit, why do I always show my hand! Catholic guilt.",

Antonio was on point our entire experience- great personality,  intuitive, always had coffee coming, and never seemed rushed. Impressive.  I'm a server and I was blown away. Right on,  Antonio!

Somehow I talk myself into believing my 12-egg omelette with hash browns, bacon, and toast is \"healthier.\"  This explains my ever-shrinking wardrobe options when I have to wear clothing not blessed by elastic.  So for my birthday breakfast, I decided I was having pancakes and would not get swayed by a breakfast burrito.  And what better place to go than a restaurant with \"pancakes\" in its name.  And strawberry pancakes I had, along with bacon and OJ.  The pancakes were light, fluffy, and golden brown and stuffed with strawberries and a compote on top made of fresh berries as well.  The bacon was thick, apple-wood smoked cooked to perfection, crispy, yet not burnt in the slightest.  And the juice fresh squeezed, of course.  YUM!    I was glad it was a nice morning, and we were able to sit outside.  The dining room wasn't anything special, and it was really loud.  Although the patio overlooks Hayden, it was much quieter there.  If only they were open for dinner!",

Had never been here before, driven by it many times, but never had the inclination to stop it till today. Place is small, maybe 20 tables, no diner counter too bad) coffee is fair to middling, they serve real cream or half and half with the coffee. Ordered a custom omelet, huge. For me, even. Two inches thick at the top, mine is loaded with bacon, sausage, cheddar, avocado and tomato. The hash browns are strictly potato, no onions or peppers. Ordered them crispy and they were. The omelets come with a side of toast or pancakes, so I am having the pancakes. The chunks of avocado are large and plentiful. The tomato is fresh, diced, no seeds. There's plentiful bacon and sausage cooked into the body of the omelet. The side of two pancakes are fine,they are fluffy, seems to be real whipped butter, their store-brand maple syrup has a good consistency, the cakes soak in the butter well. Could use some more butter but maybe I'll ask next time. There's a carafe of water with ice at the table, so I can serve myself as much water as I desire - I like that. The coffee flows pretty well, quick and seamless refills without having to ask.  Place is very crowded and quite busy, a huge mix of different types, some families, some couples, some onesies like me. I'd recommend this place to anyone for breakfast. Be warned, due to the popularity on a Wednesday morning, it must be a nightmare on the weekends!",

    "text": "Five gajillion stars for Butters! This place is amazeballs. Easily the best breakfast resteraunt I've been to in Arizona. The menu is ample with something for everyone, every dish is solid, and the food is all very fresh. I don't know how they get their eggs so light and fluffy, but it is so good and doesn't have that weird burnt-egg/grill-taste that a lot of other breakfast joints get.   My favorites are the skillets and the omelettes. I LOVE their crispy scallop-style potato hashbrowns, which are the definition of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The scrambled eggs on the skillet are light, fluffy, and so delicious. The vegetable toppings are plentiful and actually fresh, with real portobello or cremini mushrooms instead of just canned or white caps. I so love that you can get sides of pancakes with your savory main dish because most places make you order a $7 \"side\" of pancakes which puts a meal at over $15 which sucks. No, Butters gets us, and you get two pancakes with your eggs. My favorite is the Cinnamon Roll pancake, which tastes exactly like a delicious warm ooey gooey cinnamon roll. I've also had the Wild Berry Bliss and Banana Cream, which are both good. The Banana Cream is probably the least exciting of all three, but the pancake base is solid so it's hard to go wrong.",

Dining area is cramped and non-inviting in general, but clean. Eggs were over-easy and cooked to perfection. The grits had some weird cream on them. Odd, grits should be left alone. Pancakes were fluffy but not much flavor or texture. Honestly, just a mass-produced pancake with no \"specialness\" about it\". Corned beef hash that Mr. Muscle ordered was not homemade, pretty standard there too. And the hash brown (like 99% of all hash browns) are not cooked long enough or crispy enough. Its a solid breakfast at $17.00; but we were really expecting a different kind of WOW factor. Don't go out of your way, that is my advise.",

    "text": "My favorite breakfast stop in Scottsdale! The berry pancake platter is delicious, I'm pretty sure I got some weird looks for licking my plate! Considering it was a busy Saturday I was pleasantly surprised that we only had to wait about twenty minutes before we sat down. We also didn't have to wait long for our food and the server was very tentative. Will definitely be returning soon to try more of the menu. I can never bring myself to steer away from the pancake platters! My husband loves the omelet options and the more meat-centric options. And my son can easily polish off a waffle egg and sausage. Great family stop for a nice weekend breakfast.",

The fresh squeezed orange juice is a must try with your meal, and finally- please try the Smoreo pancake. We could not believe the amazing mess that was so yummy!! Our small complaint was that the noise level was pretty loud, and you could not hear across the table.",

We got there around 8am and there was already about a 40 minute wait but it went by fast. The weather was cool and we enjoyed sitting outside. My daughter ate all of her strawberry crepes, her friend devoured her pancakes and I enjoyed a skillet that came with pancakes but I was so full I had to bring the pancakes home. The pancakes were good reheated but next time I think I'll skip the skillet and just enjoy the pancakes or waffles. Gave 3 stars since the place is too small for the amount of tables, so you are stuck squeezing in between people that are trying to eat. Also give 3 stars because the food is quite pricey for traditional breakfast foods that you can get almost anywhere that serves breakfast.",

    "text": "Oh, Dragonfly Cafe, why did you have to be closed for breakfast today?  I was almost at DC's doorstep when I decided to use my Yelp app to check on the cafe's hours, and darn it, it was closed!  So, I ended up at Butters, instead.    I arrived at around 10:30a, a bit of a late start since I had to switch venue plans, but no worries, as I would only have to wait about five minutes before being seated outdoors (and it was such a beautiful morning, too!).  I'd have enjoyed listening to the water fountain across from my table a lot more if traffic sounds didn't intrude, but what can I do?  I quickly got over it.  I knew to stay away from the sweeter French toast concoctions, since the pumpkin bread variety I chose for my first visit was too sweet for my taste.  It took me awhile to decide what to have- blueberry pancakes or strawberry cheesecake French toast?  In the end, the write up on the \"house strawberry-mascarpone blend\" made the decision for me.  Ooh, I was looking forward to this!  I wish I had more time to order a cup of coffee from the coffee shop next door, since Butters' drip coffee isn't a fave of mine (or of my Mom's).  I gave it a second try today, and I still don't like it.  The wait for the French toast wasn't long, about ten minutes.  I found my first three or so bites to be delightful, but then I got bored.  I don't think I'd order the dish again, unless I were to share it with someone else knowing that I had another dish to look forward to.  I suppose not all breakfast sweets can be as great as that of the Herb Box's Red velvet pancakes, or even that of Dragonfly Cafe's Bananas foster French toast...  Perhaps I should just stick to the savory items on the menu, such as that salmon/lox omelet we enjoyed on our first trip here.  2.5 stars, but the service was OK, so rounding up to 3.  A shout-out for Rafael and the busser today.  You guys did a great job!",

It is not easy finding gluten-free options for breakfast, especially when I don't eat eggs either... I ordered a hot chocolate and the gf Belgium waffle  and my husband ordered a skillet with pancakes. My waffle did not look gluten-free; it looked delicious; it tasted delicious! it was amazing and my husband even thought the same. They make their own gluten-free flour blend using rice flour. Afterwards I ordered a berry and banana smoothie to go which is not on the menu, but they did it and it was delicious as well! Great friendly and speedy service. They were pretty busy for Thursday morning!",

We went for breakfast/brunch on a Saturday and I had their wildberry bliss pancakes which were more than blissful. The wait time was a bit on the long side, but the food was worth it. It was also a bit crowded and the tables are very cramped, but since it was so hot nobody was using the patio, so that may have alleviated things. I'd love to go back and try some of their omelets and other savory menu items.",

Ordered the following:  - wild berry pancakes: so yummy and creamy with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blue berries on the side. Definitely recommend.  - Oreo s'mores pancakes: these were good but a little on the sweet side for me.  - Mexicana omelette: omg so yum. Ate the whole thing and I don't normally finish my food. Has chorizo, avocado, cheese, salsa verde, and onions.. delicious! Comes with fruit or hash browns on the side.  - kids Mickey pancakes: ordered for my kid with the chocolate chips. He loved it and he's a picky eater. Almost ate the whole thing. Also comes with one bacon or sausage.  - corn beef hash skillet: ordered by the hubs. He said it was alright. He normally finishes his food but he didn't this time.   All in all this place is bomb and totally worth it. Two thumbs up!",

We ordered a veggie skillet, a veggie omelette, wild berry pancakes, and banana cream pancakes. The omelette was surprisingly bland. The potatoes in the skillet were very greasy. We didn't enjoy either of them.   The pancakes made up for the other entrees!  The pancakes are what dreams are made of. They were just the right amount of sweet. We found ourselves not talking much because we were simply enjoying the pancakes.   We will be back to try some of the other pancakes. They were worth the drive.",

The new location on Hayden is really nice but it feels like it is missing something like maybe some low hanging lights over the tables and maybe some booths would have been nice too.  You are probably wondering why I gave them four versus five stars.  Well, my only complaint is that the new space is modern (which I love) and has a lot of windows (another plus) but it is kind of noisy and is hard to have a conversation with someone across the table but it is still one of our favorite breakfast places!",

Ashly was our waitress and she was super cheerful and came by often. The food came quickly, was very tasty and plentiful. We took some leftovers with us and that's NEVER happened to me.

I'm kind of a greedy person and I want both savory and sweet for my breakfast; I like the option of being able to upgrade the pancakes to the speciality pancakes.  The veggie omelette: Fluffy and the veggies were very fresh, but the highlight was definitely the hash browns! It's out of this world! Perfectly crispy and clean (you know how sometimes the hash browns just came soaked in oil? Not this one).  The berry bliss pancakes: If loving this was wrong, I don't want to be right. At first, I was like \"ok it's probably overhyped. Looks like a regular pancake with berry sauce and berries on top), but the best part is the middle, it's stuffed with mascarpone cream. SO FREAKING GOOD.  I would definitely make a trip to AZ just to go to butters again...in fact, I'm already planning a trip back and butters will be my go-to breakfast place.",

The moment I walked into their new location, the sound hit me right in the face--it was like the sound of an unsupervised high school gymnasium full of kids.  Or, having a vacuum cleaner tied to your head.  The din was just about unbearable.  As delicious as the food is and has always been, I very nearly left as soon as I sat down.  I had considered this place to be one worth waiting an hour to be seated because the quality.  Now, I need to decide whether or not I ever want to return.  It literally isn't worth the headache.",

It was a delicious pairing with two perfectly poached eggs. The bacon.... was good. Not the best, but definitely still good. Could've been a little more  on the crispier side for my taste. We also ordered the Nutella stuffed French toast topped with mixed berries. Super airy and chocolaty! The coffee is also amazing. I believe they carry an AZ local, called Passport.

This place is way above and beyond your normal brunch diner-y spot. The berry french toast blew my mind. Perfectly fresh with a masterful creamy sauce, raspberry sauce and two pieces of perfectly cooked fluffy french toast big enough to make me full...perfection.  My friend had the Nutella french toast with bananas which was delicious. I mean really, it's hard to go wrong with that combo but it did NOT disappoint! Delicious!  I had a side of the chicken sausage for some protein and it was just ok: standard chicken sausage, you know. The service was so friendly and cheerful and the patio was lovely to sit on even if it was a bit chilly (they have patio warmers). They had a coffee bar inside so you can go ahead and order lattes and specialty drinks if you're waiting for a table (or once you're seated too!).",

I was so happy to find out they put this one closer to me on Raintree and Northsight.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is similar to the other Butter's off of Via de Ventura.  The patio seating is great when the weather is pleasant, but they have these wind screens outside and MistAmerica mister fans that actually make the temperature cool in the patio during the summer months.  I always get the freshly squeezed orange juice when I come here.  I have tried several things on the menu, but I have to say the California Scrambler is probably my go to and favorite item on the menu.  The eggs are nice and fluffy and the fillings taste fresh.  I would definitely recommend getting a side of protein pancakes because they are amazing.  I would definitely recommend Butter's if you are looking for a quick and easy little breakfast spot.  Be warned that if you do not get there early be prepared to wait.",

Service was quick to get us seated after a 15 minute wait.  The waitress was quick to get our drinks and the food was out fast!  We tried a variety of options include marshmallow pancakes, scramblers and plain pancakes. Everyone loved their meals. The scramblers had a huge amount of food. The combo of scrambled with a specialty pancake was the perfect balance between healthy and sweet.   Price was great for overall value. We all loved this place and can't wait to come back!",

Ok so we loved the place so much we went 2 days in a row while visiting Scottsdale.   First visit:  Hubs had corned beef hash skillet, egg whites with banana pancakes instead of toast. I had over medium eggs with bacon and sourdough toast.  Bacon was thick but not chewy/fatty thick, it was tasty with some crispiness and had a wonderful smoke flavor.  The sourdough toast was fresh, large, love the grill-ish flavor vs. toaster flavor.  Banana pancakes (not banana cream cakes, just regular banana cakes), they were fluffy and delicious not too sweet, just right and they were not doughy/raw.   Second visit:  I had the corned beef hash skillet with over medium eggs on top (much better than Hubs egg whites) delicious!  Highly recommend.  Hubs had New Mexico Skillet, which he did not like as much as corned beef hash.  But it's a matter of preference only.  He is not a chorizo eater so I have no idea why he even tried....Second visit he ordered Cinnamon Roll Cakes - he liked a lot, I thought they were way too sweet...again just preference.  Juices are fresh squeezed and large.  Mocha (hot) was tasty, good coffee/espresso not too sweet even with some whip cream.  Great place, def. go!  Inside and outside seating.  Walk up coffee bar for while you wait.  Clean.  Quick.  Delicious!",

You would think they would be the same and there are similarities but I like this one better. The pancakes and egg dishes are similar and better than most. Service is good. The wait is still an issue but waiting area outside is a little more comfortable. This also feels more like a neighborhood or locals place. It is our favorite for a regular Sunday morning breakfast.",

After calling ahead of time and receiving confirmation that dogs were allowed in the patio, I brought my small dog there for breakfast. I waited for 30 minutes for a table, only to be told by the hostess seating us that dogs were only allowed by the fence, information that I never received when I had called earlier. There were no other tables available. Then I asked to speak with the manager, since we didn't want to waste the trip and wanted to understand the situation. The manager was very defensive and unfriendly from the beginning of the conversation, and said that only service animals were allowed in the patio, also information that I did not receive over the phone when I first called. Also, there was another dog on the patio at the time that was clearly not a service animal. What happened today was very unfortunate. The food is decent, but service was clearly lacking.",

Eveyone just loves this place and while the service is good and the atmosphere OK, depending on where you sit (the patio is quite nice), the food is very mediocre.  I have dined here 3-4 times and each time I want to love the place but just don't.  I do like their Gluten-Free options as it is hard to find good breakfast places with GF choices for my daughter but it is not impossible and this one just doesn't cut it for me.  Why do I think the food is mediocre?  Well, I am picky about my pancakes and like them soft and chewy.  Theirs are very thick and break-like.  Not much different from the ones I make at home with Bisquick.  Their omelets are good but it is not hard to make a good omelet.  They look amazing as they come out very large and puffy but they taste the same as anyone else's and really just depends on your filings.  No complaints about the service, it is not terrible and it is not fantastic, it is just OK.   All in all, just an ok place to dine.  Given that there is ALWAYS a wait, I'll probably pass on this in the future.",

In actuality, Butters is a lot like Butterfield's (apparently owned by the same people), with a great selection of egg dishes and skillets.  However, the decor at Butters is sleek and modern, instead of the carpety, flowery, old people-y look of Butterfield's.  There's also a nice patio.  On the flip side, the staff wasn't quite as friendly.  They were competent, just not overly friendly.  Like Butterfield's, Butters is quite busy on weekends.  We waited about 30 minutes.  The Village Roastery in the same plaza is a great place to enjoy some coffee while waiting for a table at Butters.",

The BF and I got there at about 10 and waited for 15 minutes or so. We were seated outside, which was a bit warm, but not bad. We started by ordering coffee and they brought coffee and real cream! YES real cream!!! I was so excited but then, like some higher power knew I was having a moment of pure joy and wanted to crush it, the coffee was terrible! Like made me feel a little nauseous bad. The real cream could not save it. That is how bad it was. The BF tried the plain pancakes to test a simple offering and I ordered the eggs verde on the suggestion of our server. The pancakes were fine, but the portion was a bit small for the price. The verdes were decent, but nothing special and the black beans in it were undercooked (What is with the undercooked beans lately??). Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, but if they were giving it away for free, I suppose I would eat it.",

The scrambled eggs, seriously, is a religious experience and something of a national secret to them.  They are fluffy, not \"eggy\" tasting and wonderful.  I am sorry to report, however, that once I discovered their eggs, I really have not ordered anything else.  The service and staff have always, without exception, been first rate.  Your coffee mug, no matter how busy they are, will never get below half a mug.  The staff almost always have smiles.  Its really just a wonderful experience to be there.

Without saying anything to my girlfriend I suddenly made a U turn and I am glad I did. I figured it would be busy and it was but we gave the hostess our name and cell # and she said it would be 10 or 15 minutes and they would text when a table opened. About 8 minutes later we were in.. The menu is amazing..I wanted everything I looked at. I settled with the Banana cream pancakes and my girlfriend had the eggs Benedict. Even though the place was so busy we got our order in about 10 minutes or less.. The pancakes were amazing, they had Bananas in cream sauce and syrup with this incredible Graham cracker walnut crumbles. It was like eating dessert for breakfast. The Eggs Benedict looked amazing as well and I guess it was because my girlfriend never finishes everything on her plate but this time the plate was empty.. even all the hash browns. I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu because they have a bunch of unique items that sound delicious. Looking at some of the other plates that passed us just made me want to try everything.. Great Job Butters..",

I built my own omelet, my wife had a scramble and we shared the protein power pancakes and a fruit plate.  The portions were ample, and everything tasted great.  Coffees refilled swiftly, and the servers did a great job.  Wished I lived in the area!!!",

The scramble platters are just average...nothing special, but I highly recommend the benedicts and french toast. Of the options, we decided on the Irish Benny and Stuffed Strawberry Cheesecake Toast. These 2 dishes are not pt of a healthy breakfast but it's worth every calorie. The pancakes here are also light and fluffy. The food came ~6 or 7 minutes after we ordered, so even with a full restaurant, the kitchen staff was really quick. TLDR: Great food for a reasonable price!",

Surprisingly it's actually really affordable as well, even with added drinks and specialty pancakes!   My wife had the strawberry pancakes and I had the protein power pancakes, both were great! They are apparently know for their pancakes.  It was a bit of a long line, but that's to be expected with how busy it is. We will definitely be coming back again when we're in the area....or even if we're not, we'll make the trip.  p.s. My wife wanted me to mention that they serve Harney and Sons tea. A hot commodity apparently among tea drinkers.",

You can enjoy the sunshine and peaceful water fountain while waiting :)   Krystal did an amazing job at taking care of us today and keeping our coffee hot, on that note, I've never received bad service here!  The eggs are incredibly fluffy, like delicious fluffy egg clouds. Haha! I usually get the California Scramble, plenty of protein then add the protein pancakes for only $1!!! You can't beat that! And they are the BEST protein pancakes ever!   Today we got a little adventurous and ordered the Wildberry Bliss Cakes and Oreo Cookie S'Mores cakes. They were both amazing in their own way. Expect an extreme sugar high from the Oreo Cakes.   The only thing I would change would be to get a better roast of coffee. Other than that I really love this place! Thanks Butters for always making me happy!!",

    "text": "Happy halloween!!!! It was Easter the last time we were here. We had the california scrambler, protein pancake and veggie omelette. This time we are going on the not so healthy side if the menu. We ordered their fresh squeezed orange juice, mocha blended capuccino, the cheese blintzes french crepes, taffy apple sourdough french toast and the smoked salmon & cream cheese scrambler.   Just like the last time, service was quick. The orange juice and capuccino was out on our table fast. The orange juice was sweet and refreshing. The capuccino, it was creamy and the mocha flavor was strong enough to make my taste buds crave for more.  Food we ordered was out a few minutes after the drinks came out. Big portions!!! 2 persons can share on the scrambler and still feel satisfied.   The smoked salmon & cream cheese scrambler had a lot of good points and some low points. The onion, cream cheese and smoked salmon worked well. The smoked salmon just had enough saltiness and the smoky finish works well with the cream cheese. The smoked salmon, cream cheese, onion and egg in one bite creates a good balance. I missed a little kick if spice which was aided by the hot sauce on the table. Since every bite did not have cream cheese and salmon, I would have wanted a little salt or garlic powder on the egg. (Just to add... The hashbrowns were awesome)  The cheese blintzes french crepes were a little overwhelming. I felt that there was a little too much filling that it took away the balance between the crepe and filling. It was OK. Maybe a little too OK. I think it might work better if it was folded with the filling instead of rolled like a burrito. The fresh strawberries and stawberry sauce are required on every bite. There were just too much ricotta and cottage cheese on every bite. Maybe this would work for the cottage cheese lovers.  The Taffy apple sourdough french toast was a little dry for my taste but the flavors were spot on. No one can go wrong with the combination of apple, caramel, and cinnamon. The apples were the perfect texture. Soft but still had a bite on it which paired well with the pecan sprinkled on the plate. A little more caramel or maybe addig some caramel in between the toast might help eliminate some of the dryness.  Again, good service and above average food. Nothing that would stop me from visiting this breakfast joint again.

I have never had an eggs benny this way but it was super flavorful. The eggs were poached perfectly.   Must get the OJ! Freshly squeezed! Ohh so refreshing!",

I am not even really a pancake person and I never would have ordered them had they not come with my meal. They also have other specialty pancakes, like banana cream and wild berry.

I wish they would incorporate more gluten free items to their menu like gluten free bread for sandwiches and more GF sauces/dressings. This place is what I call a half a** gluten free restaurant it really has a minimal gluten free menu. I was disappointed that all I can order here is a few breakfast items and salads. I have Celiacs diesease so its hard for me to find places I can eat out.   I asked on two separate occasions if the salad dressing (which are all homemade btw) are gluten free. On the first occasion I was told yes they are safe for me to eat and all are made in house and gluten free on one visit . On my next visit I was told non of the salad dressings are gluten free and oil and vinegar was my only option. For being a gluten free restaurant the service staff and chefs are not well trained and have no knowledge on what is safe for people who come here for the gluten free options. I wasn't impressed that the two different chef's lack of knowledge and that service staff had no idea also what was in most of the dressings and sauces. I waitresses for years and I was always trained on the  ingredients in all of the menu items and I worked at a very basic restaurant that did not have any GF options. I expect more of a knowledge base about the food from the staff at a place like Butters. I will only order the GF Waffle or GF Pancakes from now on as I don't think I am safe trusting the word of the employees on items that are not specified as being gluten free on the menu. This place needs to train their staff better and for that reason I couldn't give it five stars. Great food and atmosphere though!",

Hubby ordered the banana nut French toast with a side of bacon.  Banana nut bread dipped in egg and grilled.  I think the problem may have been the bread had not been cooked long enough as the texture was a bit on the gummy side.  Unfortunately, this was too sweet for our taste.  I had the corn beef hash skillet.  Corn beef hash served on top of hash browns topped with melted cheese and 2 eggs.  This is served with your choice of toast or pancakes.  I opted for the pancakes since toast is toast.  What can you do to toast other than burn it?!?  The corn beef hash was okay and the hash browns were crisp as requested.  Pancakes were decent, but I have tasted lighter and better elsewhere.    Not worth a special trip, but if in the area, it is an okay choice.",

    "text": "i've been here a couple of times. there is always a wait for breakfast, as there are with quality breakfast places. i looked over the menu this past saturday and decided that a baked potato omelet looked fantastic. only problem is, it has bacon in it, which i can't eat. i asked the waitress if i could get it without the bacon, and add jalapenos instead and she said yes, but it'd cost me an extra 25 cents. no problem, i thought, even though we all know that the higher ticket item there is the meat. when i received my meal, i discovered bacon in it! there were minute amounts of bacon, btw, so if bacon is your thing you may want to also get a side of bacon with it. anyway, i had already eaten some of the omelet before discovering the intrusion, and i wasn't that hungry anyway, so i just ate the side of potatoes and the toast and called it good, hoping i wouldn't get sick, as that is what eating bacon does to me. thankfully, i had caught it in time, before i had accidentally eaten any.   note to any people with food allergies or special requests: this place will not make accommodations. period.",

When we walked in to put our name on the list we did not receive a warm welcome. We asked for a table for four but told them the other two people in our party would be joining us in about 30  minute. They said everyone had to be there in order to seat us. The manager came over and he was even more rude to us. Told us there was nothing he could do, that unless everyone was there they would only give us a table for two. I looked into the restaurant and there were several parties of two people who were seated at tables for four. Super disappointed in the customer service aspect of this place so didn't even stay Won't be coming back!!",

I reported to the server, but server said\" I am sorry we cannot comp it just because you ate 1/8 of one of the slices\" Hello, this is 6.95! It is not 69.95! I work in a restaurant industry and nice gesture of \"we can take it out of your bill would be nice\" or even a sorry would be good enough! How will I know if the toast was hard if I did not actually put it in my mouth? It was one small bite. The server was not nice at all. I am an avid goer of Butterfields which is their sister company- they are always nice! but Butters has no customer care at all! Not to mention the 1 hour wait!",

We chose a veggie omelet with hash browns, pancakes and bacon. It took no time at all for the food to come out and it was all amazing.  The omelet was big and so fluffy. Perfect veggies. Hash browns were really more like american fries and were good. Bacon was cooked perfectly. And the pancakes were also great.  Anxious to return and try more.

Here is how we do it: Put your name on the list. Ask for the patio if it's open.  Go next door to Village Coffee. Get something to sip on and chill out while you wait.   I'm not usually a breakfast person, but this is good. Likely one of the best I've had. The OJ is fresh squeezed. The staff is helpful and attentive, but not overly so. When it's nice out, the patio is great (that's why we live here, right?). I go with the World's Pickiest Eater (gotta love her) and she over-complicates her order with special instructions every time. They always get it right. The small wins add up for me.",

They should be giving this stuff away for free to power diesel engines.   The coffee tastes like something you would buy in a small town Circle K. At least they have whole cream to dissipate the taste!  The food is very bland.  I have been here twice and it was just as bad both times. I would give it two stars because it's next to a very good coffee roaster, but they obviously prefer Christian Bros instead. So, why don't they go next door and buy their coffee? Stupidity? Ego?",

I had the corned beef hash skillet with over easy eggs and sourdough toast. It was enough food that I didn't finish, which isn't very typical and for only $9.45, so it's a fair trade in my opinion. The eggs were cooked perfectly as well as the potatoes, perfectly golden with those crunchy bits that bring out a good potato flavor. The corned beef was a little mutilated for me, it almost like it was ground it was so finely chopped and although it was good, it could've had a little more flavor, maybe some green chiles or just some onions in the mix of things to give it a bit of zing to it.",

The hostess informed it would be about a 30-45 min wait, which we didn't mind. Great news is we were sat within 20 mins!   We were sat down and waited on immediately by our waitress who asked for our drink order. Very shortly after, we were asked to move to a booth which I was not mad about at all! I prefer booths, and I don't mind moving to help other get seated quickly!  I ordered the HMOP skillet without cheese (I'm lactose intolerant) with two sunny side up eggs and upgraded the pancakes to the infamous and highly spoken about Oreo Pancakes! My fiance ordered the Denver Omelette with egg whites and upgraded to Chocolate Chip pancakes.   We were expecting to be waiting for quite some time for our food to be cooked and prepared, especially because the place was quite busy! But to our very surprise our food was out within 15 mins!   Our pancakes looked a little smaller than we expected but since they came with our skillet and omelette that explained why they weren't big. We were not complaining at all!! They were actually the perfect amount and size considering we had another plate of food!  My fiance's omelette looked amazing and I captured a picture of the perfectly melted cheese which he ordered the jalapeno cheese. He said that it wasn't too spicy and was delicious. His pancakes were super fluffy and had chocolate chips inside!  My skillet came with potatoes on the bottom (they were nice and crispy and brown) ham, mushrooms, and onions with two sunny side up eggs. The oozing yolk all over my potatoes and made for a tasty skillet!    Now the moment I had been waiting for and was most excited to try were the Oreo Pancakes!! They were delicious! Nice and fluffy with Oreo cookie pieces inside, topped with marshmallow type whipping creme, chocolate chips, pieces of Oreo and drizzled with chocolate syrup. These pancakes need no syrup! They were the perfect amount of sweetness and syrup would have only taken away from the flavor!    The service here is GREAT!! They're attentive and quick!   I would highly recommend this place for a flavorful breakfast/brunch!",

To start, any egg or omelette dish you order is going to be cooked to perfection.  I don't know how they get their eggs so light and airy, but it's magical and I'm happy to put stock into.  My favorite has been the Mexicana omelette with chorizo, jalapeno cheese, avocado and topped with New Mexican green chili.  It's awesome.  What's even more awesome? You get 2 side dishes to add to it.  My go-to's are the cheese grits (I'd order these on their own if they didn't come with it - so good!) and the pancakes.  Butters is known for their pancakes and there's a good reason for it - they're fantastic!  If you love breakfast foods, you should definitely give Butters a try!! :)",

Never mind that we often share food and beverages nearly everywhere we go.   As I write this, I'm getting angry all over again. The incident happened months ago.

Wait time: shorter than most, reserve your seating with app, staff is friendly. Parking: good during weekend but during the week it is questionable since it is located in a plaza with other businesses nearby that utilize shared parking. Therefore, it could prove to be challenging. Menu: good selection of breakfast & lunch options with options for gluten free select items.  Food: Breakfast plates are of generous portions, quality ingredients and fresh tasting. Not greasy in any way.  Wait staff service: impeccable, professional, and courteous. Service with a smile and they actually say, \"thank you\", whereas other establishments remain silent on this simple act of courtesy and graciousness, which in this day and age is a simple act of human kindness that is lacking.

Bacon i could taste the smoked applewood in it. French toast was good. I like the vibe of the place and the GF stuff they have! You probley wait longer to get in than you do to get your food. It was like i ordered and blinked and my food was done. Pretty awesome. The reason for my 2 stars is the young lady at the front was too busy talking to the shorter girl about her black long nails. That i stood at the front, right in front of her for awhile saying excuse me just so she could take my name down. After awhile she stopped and said, oh im sorry i just got my nails done i had to show her.  Alright... I asked her how long the wait was and she gave me an attitude saying she didnt know because she had to go look for someone, to ask when she comes back. Then,  just turned back around and kept talking about her nails. My waitress failed to bring me a refill after asking 4 times and still never got one, but she managed to bring the check. Thank god for the water on the table! So, this place is really good and deserves all the credit for their food. But my service today sucked. For a first timer, i may not be back only because of the service.",

    "text": "After trying Butterfield's Pancake House I decided to try its sister venue Butters.  WOW this place is just as good as Butterfields if not better.  The first time I went there I ordered the Eggs Benedict which were dissappointingly small howevere with the side of fresh buttermilk pancakes it was just the right amount.  If they somehow made the portions bigger I would never order anything else on the menu EVER AGAIN!  The second time I went back was with my girlfriend and we had both had a long night of partying and drinking the night before.  I knew walking in that the small eggs benedict would not help with this hangover so I opt'd for the build your own omlet.  I ordered an egg white omlet with bacon tomatoes, onions, green peppers and avocado.  The plate came out and I knew right away it was love at first site.  It was enormous, and oozing with cheese. Just what the doctor ordered.  My girlfriend got the banana bread french toast and we each got sides of bacon and sausage and split some pancakes.  The homemade The two main dishes were amazing and the thick cut bacon was a great sponge for the alcohol sitll in our system.  I can not say enough good things about both Butterfields and Butters.  If I had to choose I would choose Butters, though the menus are very similar Butters seemed to have more of my demographic dining there (mid 20's early 30's) young and energetic.  Butterfield's is more of the family spot or the spot for grandma and grandpa.  I will definitely be going to both again.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK  PS- please make your eggs benedict larger!!! :)",

I didn't mind the wait time on Sunday, but was really annoyed at having to wait another 10 or more minutes just to get a cup of coffee once seated, as well as the lack of attention paid to us during our meal.  At one point, I had to ask another server for refills, cause our server was MIA. The Brioche French Toast and chicken sausage I ordered was nothing special and my companion's omelet didn't impress either.  They sure didn't try to dress up the dishes in any way (no little garnishes of any sort like you would expect) and our food looked like it was thrown on the plate haphazardly.  I will say that the grits looked yummy, but again the portion size was disappointing.   To spend $29 without tip for a breakfast for two also seems high, so I don't expect to be back anytime soon!",

But I was able to order a couple of things to-go for my boyfriend and I.  They have this yummy New Mexico skillet that comes with your choice of eggs any style, cheese, onions, tomatoes, peppers and avocados!!! And they put a good amount for me. We also ordered the Wildberry French Crepe. It was good but I think it would've been a little better if the edges were a bit crispier. I liked the filling but not so much my fruits glazed. It was still delicious though! Would definitely come back if in town again! With two entrees came out to about $23! Woo hoo!",

Had the Create your Omelette with Corn Beef Hash and Mushrooms with Hash Browns and Oreo S'more Pancakes. The Omelette was as big as a Chipotle Burrito but was lacking a little flavor and Corn Beef Hash. The Oreo S'more Pancakes were pretty good and a very creative combination, have to give them props on that portion.  We also ordered the fresh squeezed OJ and was very good. They have a machine that loads up oranges and then feeds it into the machine to generate the fresh squeezed juice and it is very good and can not get any more fresh.  The inside decor is classic and very nice with the area around in a nice shopping area, we went of a Monday late afternoon where there was no wait.   Will come back again to try other pancakes or breakfast items and maybe the salads or the Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast. Definitely like the different dishes that they offer.",

Upon walking in the hosted did not smile or greet us, merely asked, \"how many?\" as she turned heel and led as to an immediately available table. Quite unfriendly. The tables are crammed in this location so tighly that even a small adult has to turn sideways to squeeze between the tables to get seated. Because the tables are so tightly packed in this place that meant it was a much louder atmosphere as well. Not good for a business breakfast.  I ordered a simple 2 eggs, hash browns, and ham order. No spice of any kind was used, just how I would get them at Denny's. :(  The menu is quite similar to Butterfields but I noticed a couple of things different. Baked pancakes are not offered at this location. Secondly, the french toast comes with a scoop of vanilla icecream on top instead of whipped cream. I didn't care for that option so skipped my usual of Wildberry Bliss french toast.  Our server was the only employee in the entire restaurant that cracked a smile. Because of the cramped quarters I don't think anyone likes where they work.  With average, bland food at this location, tight quarters, unfriendly and loud environment, we will not return. We will continue to go to Butterfields instead, which is still our #1 breakfast place in town.",

Butters also does not have many booths any longer. They have padded seating along one wall but with chairs across the table. Another wall has some oddly shaped larger booths but we can forget about sitting in a comfortable booth, one of us will always have to sit on a chair.

I had the Mexican omelette , with hash browns, two buttermilk pancakes, and the fresh squeezed orange juice. The portions were good, the  omelette was tasty, the hash browns were cooked to perfection with some crunch, and the pancakes....... let's just say I now know why they are \"known\" for their pancakes. The next time I go, I will skip the coffee for another glass of the OJ.  I will end this by adding that the service was fast, friendly, and very attentive.",

    "text": "Butters was absolutely packed when we got there this morning and had to wait an hour before we were seated. Given the great reviews, we decided it was worth it- totally not worth it. I ordered the New Mexico skillet and my boyfriend the California scramble with pancakes. I can't speak for the scramble but the skillet was unappetizing. I ordered the eggs to be over medium, got over easy; chorizo was soooooooo salty and had a very strange aftertaste, making it pretty much inedible; potatoes drenched in oil/grease. I was so excited for the pancakes but even those were lackluster. It was light and fluffy but it just sort of crumbled in my mouth. There were two things I did love: First is the freshly squeezed OJ. Yum. Second is the service. My waitress (shucks that I can't remember her name) was great- very sweet, attentive, and pleasant.",

No skimping on the egg whites! It was also very light and fluffy. The potatoes were cut in slices like you would for scalloped potatoes. They were not greasy and had a crispness on either side of the portion.  The service was very prompt and friendly. The place is very clean and somewhat simple in design. The bathroom was kept up with no tissues, etc, on the floor nor a lack of tissue and paper towels.  I would recommend to go earlier than later unless you don't mind a wait.

However, on my recent visit I was very disappointed when the male manager called out one of his female staff in the middle of the dining room.    I don't need to know that some guy called asking for her and that apparently they will only accept emergency phone calls while they are working!  Not only do I not care to hear about their personal policy, but I also don't feel like having that feeling of dread while trying to enjoy my breakfast.  I am sure this particular female staff member was feeling the exact same at that moment since I was the only one in the whole dining room at that time and I made it very apparent that I was listening to their conversation with disgust.  Not only did I want to come to her defense, but I was also fighting that overwhelming urge to tell that jerk of a boss to go kick rocks.  For a very brief moment, I thought John Quinonez was going to come out of kitchen and surprise me with a face full of cameras!  When is it ever appropriate to front off your staff in front of your guests?  Never!  And it always seems to be the male management committing these crimes.  The days of female bashing are gone.  As I've always said, \"Praise in public, punish in private!\"  Chance are real good I will not be returning to Butters and I hope that poor female staff member finds another restaurant to full fill her goals and hopefully she will be under more professional management.  Better yet, I  hope she becomes his manager some day and fires his unprofessional male chauvinistic ass!",

The food is clean and healthy and hot.  Perfect food.    This venue is also recently completely overhauled and essentially 2011 new on the inside, so you have shiny tables tops and linens, sparkling light fixtures, a good crowd-level ambience with loudness, but you dont have to yell at your tablemate to be heard.  My only hesitation here is service.  Every time we've gone, it's been 4 times now, we get another doe-eyed server, barely driving age or in freshman year of college who doesnt have ANY experience on waiting tables.  I mean every time. We even had to return a 'to go' order because they gave us regular pancakes, not banana.    If management pulls their training program together (and they had better, this is Scottsdale, and your competition will eat you alive), this a must see, must goto breakfast joint with a fresh and clean edge and better food.  If you can tolerate the quirky service with your NY Times or AZ Replublic in hand, you're in the right spot!",

My constants are either the cobb salad with honey mustard or the California chicken club with French fries. I'm unhealthily addicted to the French fries and would put the honey mustard dressing on absolutely anything I would eat ever. It's home made and delicious. Now the reason this is only a 4 star is your pricing. $3.45 for 3 scrawny pieces of bacon that are as thin as 2 pencils put next to each other? really? And over $5.00 for an Orange Juice? I know it's Scottsdale but re-visit that pricing structure Butters! Either way, my wallet may eternally be unhappy with me, but I will continue to be loyal because of the convenience and the consistency of deliciousness.",

We waited outside in the heat, when it is over 100* it's uncomfortable.  Just before our buzzer went off I noticed people getting their buzzer and then heading to the coffee joint a couple doors down. Note to self for my next visit.   We had coffee with fresh cream, amazed at the fresh cream. I thought the decaf was Very good. Not bitter at all. Husband ordered OJ and raved about it. He insisted I try his, and then I ordered one for myself. I would say that was the best OJ we've ever had.   What to order... There is such variety in the menu that it was difficult to choose. I went with the corned beef skillet and pancakes. Yum!! The pancakes were nice and light. Oh so good! The corned beef was a bit sparse in the dish, but it was still very good. Butters owners must have listened to previous Yelpers and updated the hash browns, we loved the very thin cut and browned potatoes.  Husband ordered the usual eggs, bacon, English muffin and hash brown. He enjoyed it all. His over hard eggs were cooked to perfection for him. We also shared the apple crepes. Heaven on earth! Never having had crepes before, I am hooked! Husband is a crepe lover and said these were the fluffiest he's ever had. I can't wait to go back and try the banana and Nutella version. It will have to be soon.   About the service...it was decent. Nothing spectacular. The waitress really didn't have much personality. However, she tended to our needs very well.   Something I thought was odd. They give you the bill without a check folder  and you are to pay your server. So we had to lay out a $100 that we wanted to break. I don't know why that bothers me. But I don't think I would want my credit card laying out either. Again, just something minor.",

The first experience the food was very good, but the noise level was soooooo high you could not have a conversation.  The next visit....we both commented that the hash browns were very greasy. We didn't eat them. Today...7:15am...the noise level was tolerable since the restaurant was not full yet. But again...the hash browns were sooooo greasy. We both had an upset stomach for the rest of the day. We won't be going back.",

It had very good reviews and I'm a sucker for pancakes. The menu is extensive, but I decided to get an omelette because you get pancakes or toast with the omelette.  The omelette was large, light and fluffy as well as the protein power pancakes I had. They give you plenty of food because the omelette also comes with a choice of hash browns or grits. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious and I had to refrain from ordering more. I left stuffed and it should satisfy my hunger on the long flight home.  For those who love breakfast, this is highly recommended,",

    "text": "Butters was a great spot for our Sunday brunch. I was anticipating a very crowded restaurant, with a long wait, much like its sister restaurant Butterfield's on Shea. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away.   Neither hubby or I could decide between the breakfast and lunch menu. Everything we saw that was brought out from the kitchen looked enticing. Hubby opted for the corned beef hash skillet with raisin toast! He proclaimed it as the best corned beef hash he's had here in the valley -- quite the compliment. I, being the pickier eater of the two of us, ordered the grilled cheese sandwich on artisan bread with bacon . . . my preference always is the bacon had to be done very well and the fries, almost burnt. And that is pretty much what I got and loved every bite!   Service was friendly, but not overwhelmingly so. Coffee and iced tea were both refilled without having to ask or wait too long. The restaurant itself is pleasant, clean and well laid out. I hope to be able to sit on their patio soon, if we get a day below 100 degrees. Expect nothing fancy. The bathrooms were immaculate. Prices are very reasonable!   I loved that the employees get to eat in the restaurant on break . . . if they sit next to you, then you'll know what to order next time. The salads looked so delicious!   We'll be back . . .",

Our server comes out and tells me how cute my 10 week old puppy is even asks if she can pet it and if it needs water. Then a few mins later the manger comes out and says they don't allow dogs on the patio. But offers to chain him up outside the gate, it was beyond rude we are celebrating a family event and I felt upset that the server acted so nice but failed to mention you can't have dogs. We are in Arizona and the ground outside would burn my puppy's feet which is why I was holding him. Never would eat here again the manger was so rude and didn't care that he broke up a family event. If I could put negative stars I would.",

    "text": "I'm always looking for a new breakfast place and this was a fun one to try.  Tucked away in a shopping square off Hayden and Via de Ventura, Butters offers some local good eats.  Service deserves 5 star.  When you walk in, the restaurant feels fresh and clean.  It offers a good menu full of options.  We tried the California scrambler and the corned beef skillet.  The California was scrumptious with moist chicken, chunks of avocado and properly cooked eggs.  The hashbrowns were also crisp golden brown.  I chose the corned beef due to another Yelper giving it a great review....  maybe if I were not a corned beef lover and did not mind the canned variety I would feel differently.  But, in my opinion, the best local cafes offering this dish make their own corned beef hash that doesn't come pre-salted from a can.  So as you can assume, this was a huge disappointment to me.    Oh, and as assumed, Sm'oreo pancakes are too sweet.  That's my own fault for ordering.  If it were closer to my house I might frequent this more often, however I do not see enough unique items to bring me back!  I prefer Butterfield's, Breakfast Joint, and Chez Vous anytime",

For starters, the coffee and orange juice were both really good. I was skeptical of the famous banana cream pancakes just because it didn't sound good to me. Boy was I wrong. It was very tasty and not too sweet. The wild berry pancakes were also very good and just a tad sweeter. The corned beef hash was so good as they actually use real corned beef. This was the second best corned beef I've ever had (1st is the hash from Richard Walker in San Diego). The eggs were also fluffy and plentiful (unlike the ones you get at an iHop or Village Inn).  The only down side is the wait time. Get there extra early on a weekend or expect to wait at least an hour. All in all I believe it's definitely worth the wait.",

    "text": "Man do Arizonans love their breakfast! There are so many breakfast restaurants and Butters is definitely one of top places we tried. I loved that they had interesting flavors for their pancakes. It was basically dessert for breakfast. Oreo s'more pancakes? Yes! Banana cream pancakes? Yes! Service was nice and the food was great.  The menu is kind of confusing. If you order the eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and specialty pancakes combo it comes with plenty of food. Wish they would re-write it so it's clear what you get.",

Both times they neglected to check our order to the ticket and we didn't get bacon we ordered. It appears that they are not checking the food to the ticket prior to bagging the order. If you order to take out, my advice is to check your order prior to leaving the restaurant. This will not stop us from eating there because the food is good.",

In addition to arguing with me about how they wouldn't be able to cook my egg whites over hard  (\"I'll have to ask the manager if that can be done,\") she walked around with such a smug and unhappy look.  But the restaurant itself is very nice. Clean, comfortable, and I like that a carafe of ice water is on every table. The wild berry crepe and egg whites over hard (yes, it could be done) were excellent.  Bad taste in my mouth and probably wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "This review has been a long time coming. My lady and I hit up Butters on the regular, usually Saturdays or Sunday mornings. If you get there early enough, you can avoid waiting too long. There's a special time in the late morning, when all the early risers are leaving Butters, and all the good parking spots open up. You'll have to wait a few minutes longer, but it's worth the 20 less steps you'll have to take to get into the diner.  While you're waiting, you can order coffee-type beverages from the barista at the front. It's not the best, and I'd advise just waiting until you're seated to order the house blend.  The staff is obsessively attentive, but not annoyingly so. They zoom in with coffee -- iced during the summer, of course -- and take our orders, which arrive within 5-6 minutes, without fail. I fear that they have developed some nanosynthesis food production technology. Or maybe they're just really good at being a diner.  I'm the kind of guy that has a \"usual\" at restaurants. Butters is no exception. I'll get three eggs poached, bacon, hashbrowns and protein pancakes. When I'm feeling unusual, I'll opt for one of their skillets or omelets. Whatever you get here, you're going to love it. My girlfriend gets the berry bliss or strawberry cheesecake french toasts, which I am more than happy to partake in. I never leave Butters feeling underfed or unsatisfied.  I've never ordered from their lunch menu, so I can't offer my opinion on it. I'm not curious enough to find out. Butters isn't my \"lunch\" place, and I hate change.",

The surrounding area is very upscale and affluent. Kia Souls are few and far between here.  This location gets very busy on the weekends, so hit it early or you may be waiting a while. They have traditional breakfast items and nothing to fancy or alluring specials.   It has a nice atmosphere and the facility is very clean. My service was excellent and all of the servers were we quick to ask if I looked like I needed attention.  They have two locations I believe and both run along the same lines. There are a few boutique shops around the area. Also, you are pretty close to Salt River Fields for Spring Training.  Check them out. They are good for breakfast!  #irishcatv2 #vino2 #vino2ultimate #vinosquared",

Make sure you get here before 9am on the weekends or else you will be put on a wait list. Everyone and their Mother is here on the weekends. I have been to their old location over twenty times and have always had the best quality breakfast. Their old location was at the Corner of Hayden/Via de Ventura, with a nice patio and giant fountain in front of it. They now are in a larger building and the ambience is more like Butterfields, their sister restaurant off Shea.   Each and every time I start off with a coffee and their fresh squeezed OJ. Cannot go wrong with these two to start! The traditional Bacon and Eggs, Skillets, Scramblers, and Omelettes all come with toast and grits, OR you can upgrade to their Signature Cakes for $1.50. I highly recommend doing this option as they have Wildberry Bliss, Oreo S'Mores, Cinnamon Roll, Protein Cakes, and many other options. This morning I went with their Santa Fe Scrambler (Chorizo, Eggs, Peppers, and Cheese) w/ the Oreo S'Mores Signature Cakes. My favorite breakfast spot around but just remember to get their early!",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the restaurant was silly enough to place a group with small children far from one another (parents in back and kids at the front of the restaurant) the kids were sticking their fingers into the sugar containers and running around making a mess. They were too far from parents to notice and the manager never told the parents. It made me wonder how often this happens and glad that i never needed to use the sugar at my table!   Omelette was fantastic and my husbands Irish Benedict was amazing! Food is worth it.",

There was a carafe of ice cold water already on the table for us. Our waitress came quickly to greet us and get our drink order. My son got a strawberry smoothie and said it was the best ever. I tasted it and it was so creamy fruity and delish! I ordered the Santa Fe scramble which was eggs with chorizo, onions, pepper, jalapeno and cheese. It was served with the most tasty thin cut crispy potatoes. It came with either pancakes or toast. I opted to try a side of banana cream pancakes. Holy crap. I died and went to heaven with the first bite. So fluffy with banana cream and chunks of fresh banana slices and a graham cracker crumble of some sort. It was sprinkled from the heavens above. My son got the strawberry chocolate chip pancakes and he was thrilled with his choice. I will be bringing family and friends here in the very very near future!!",

I ordered the California scramble, it was wet when it arrived 8 minutes later. It was like someone in the kitchen poured the liquid egg matter in a saucepan and they added all the other ingredients then rolled it onto my plate.  The grits. The grits! Annoyingly slash weirdly cheesy and creamy ..like they put evaporated milk and 5 cheeses in it. Why would they do something like that? I'm genuinely bothered.  Not too tasty. Please fix it. Thank you. Amen. It was a nice surprise to have raisin bread as my toast though",

We expected a long wait...well we got that too (although 30 minutes for a party of 5 isn't so bad) but it was worth it and I very much appreciated the use of technology that allowed us to track how many parties were ahead of us and how we were progressing on the waitlist.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because they have a policy with making sure your entire party has to be present to get seated. So we were a little annoyed by that but maybe more so because of how the hostess acted towards us. Mind you we had 3 out of 4 us there; but we waited for our friend to arrive nevertheless. (She arrived less then 5 minutes later btw).   Moving onto their food and beverages, we ordered a variety of meals. All meals came out at the same time, and tasted delicious! The orange juice is freshly squeezed, lattes are also a great choice if you need that caffeine kick. The banana pancakes are sweet so you'll get full fast, the skillets were prepared nicely and very fulfilling.   We will come back again of course making sure our whole party is there before entering our name on the waitlist.",

I especially liked the big glass syrup bottle on the table for all the pancake syrup you need. You can also purchase a side of real maple syrup, if you like that, for only $2.  I'm looking forward to also trying what looks like a great lunch menu also...maybe next time.",

Looking through my Quicken tonight, I realized I've spent nearly $340 between Butters and Butterfield's restaurants in the past 6 weeks - which is when I first heard of this company. I have never been so blown away by a restaurant group that I wanted to eat there almost every day. In all of my times eating here, I can't think of a single flaw I've found with ANY point of service or food. Everyone is nice, the wait is never uncomfortable or long, the service is always prompt and pleasant, and every single item I've eaten is delicious. I am honestly envious of what this company has achieved. To be so on point on absolutely every area of their business, they must put thought into perfecting every area and take steps daily to maintain consistent excellence. I honestly don't know how they do it, but I'm glad they do.",

A little unseasoned and they do not serve liquor.  Is it even brunch if there is no mimosa options?  I am giving them a lower rating because of their staff.  We had a large party and they gave us an hour wait time which was fine.  However, after only 15 minutes they were ready and annoyed by us not having our whole party immediately there saying that they would not seat us.  Some of my party had gone to go get coffee elsewhere as they did not want to wait.  We were seated however and the waitress came quickly and took orders.  However, as soon as plates were being picked up checks hit the table and the signed bill was taken quickly. This rush made us feeling like we had to leave immediately.  There are so many other wonderful breakfast places in Scottsdale that I would pass on going back to Butters.",

Food came out fairly quick.  Based on reviews, tried bacon Belgium waffles. Bacon is inside the waffles as well as on top. Salty bacon and sweet waffles were perfect combination.   Also tried my ultimate favorite breakfast, classic egg benedict. It came with hash browns. Never had this kind, potato was sliced thin, parts of it was a tad burned but good taste for sure. Egg benedict tasted like egg benedict should taste like.  Best part was freshly squeezed orange juice. It tasted so good, wished they served it with champagne.   Most food was just about $10 each, great price, fast service, no wonder why they have a long wait on weekend morning.",

So prior to arriving in Scottsdale I had done my due diligence and had YELPED breakfast places.  Breakfast is my favorite meal and I have high standards. We were only going to have one day of our trip where we were going to have time for breakfast so I had to make my pick.  Five stars is not enough for this place.  First we were greeted by the owner.  The family is from Chicago and they have been in the restaurant business for many decades. He made us feel so at home.  For those that love omelettes, without a doubt they make THE FLUFFIEST omelets I have ever had. Just beautiful and delicious.  On to the Pancakes- you CAN NOT go here without having the pancakes.  I ordered the Pecan Pancake and it was so good!  One of my friends had  Strawberry Pancakes and said they were heavenly.  Chocolate Chip Pancakes were scrumptious.  Then the owner brought us out the MOST DELICIOUS Vanilla Bean \"icing\" to put on the pancakes.  He said they make it for the Wild Berry Pancakes but he said we had to try it. Holy Smokes I could live on that stuff.  They make it by grinding fresh vanilla beans..... Need I say more.  My one friend said it was \"The Best Breakfast of her life\".  I have to say its definitely up there as my best all time breakfast as well.  I hope we have to go back to Scottsdale in the near future and Butters is one of the reasons why!",

However, it is never okay to make the guest feel rushed. Too bad for her, I would have tipped extra as \"table rent\". I won't be back. There are too many other good places to eat.",

    "text": "Man it always seems to be so incredibly busy here. It was a 45min - 1hr wait on a weekend but we got right in on a weekday. Though just barely because the room was packed!  The seating is odd. It's like they tried to fit tables in where they could. We almost touched elbows with the table next to us from our booth, it was that close.   Ambience is loud and just an overall crowded feeling. Almost claustrophobic. Kids are out of control here but that's not on the restaurant. Just very kid and baby friendly here.   I got the wild berry bliss pancakes which were good. Not too sweet. It's blueberry filled pancakes with mascarpone cream in between and a drizzle of strawberry sauce and vanilla cream. It comes with a generous side of berries as well. That mascarpone cream was delicious.    BF got a wild hog skillet. The size was very small and honestly, it did not look much different from those skillets you get at Denny's. Just a smaller size for a greater price.   The OJ is fresh but I prefer the ones at Original Breakfast House. Personal preference.   Overall place is definitely ok. French toast and pancakes seem to be the stars here. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back simply because of the crowdedness and more than likely long wait.",

I had a Denver Omelette with pancakes.  Was really good.  Super fluffy omelette and hands down the best pancakes I have ever eaten.  I'm not exaggerating.  The service was very good.  Coffee cup was never empty.  My advice, make the wait if you can spare the time.  You won't be sorry.",

Our hash browns were great and the bacon was thick, well cooked, and delicious. The side of fruit was fresh, delicious, and irresistible to my son. He also gobbled up almost all of his pancakes and he's usually very picky.   The place is pretty small and packed in, so that can present a challenge, but we went late Tuesday morning so we had basically no wait.

I know, but it's True and going to either one benefits the same owners anyway so who cares). And I my friends, well I am a Butters fan which says a lot because I am not a breakfast person, but if Butters is in the equation - I am so there.  Why do I love Butters so much? Well, it's their pancakes, specifically their Protein Power Cakes, well, more specifically it's their Egg-ceptional two egg breakfast with bacon, hash browns,  AND pancakes for $8.50. BUT you can upgrade to any one of their specialty pancakes for $1 more - done and done.  I get this exact meal every time I go there, I can't help and its sssooo much food. The portions here are very generous that you won't be hungry again until diner. Butters also offers fresh squeeze OJ, fountain soft drinks, tea, drip coffee and several espresso drinks.   On the weekends you can expect a 30-60 minute wait for breakfast it's that popular. Luckily, you can order drinks right next to the hostess stand so that you the coffee you need to help stay awake while you wait. Even with the chaos of maximum occupancy at all times during the weekend, the staff is always on their A game. My husband and I have never had bad service - ever; and all staff from the hostesses, coffee attendant, waiters, and bussers are always friendly and smiling (usually). When the weather is cooler, it's nice to sit outside on their patio, it's a pretty complex and there is a water fountain nearby.",

The menu is about the same as Butterfield's, but that is a good thing, because I have never tried something that I didn't like!  Lately I have been a big fan of the Popeye Scramble, with onions, bacon, spinach and jack cheese...it is divine.  The hash browns are crispy and I can never decide between the thick sourdough toast or the melt in your mouth pancakes!  Yesterday the pancakes were the winner, and they were delicious as usual, my favorite pancakes in town!  We did have to wait about 30 mintues on a Sunday morning to be seated, but that is on par with all the other good breakfast places in the area.  But Butter's makes up the time by getting the food out fast!  I spoke to the owner and apparently any new locations that they open are going to be in the Butter's name....but who cares what the name is as long as the food is good!",

Every time I go I order the Denver omelette made with egg whites and feta cheese. It is so light and fluffy, and always comes out served hot. The I order it served with has browns and either toast/pancakes. The pancakes and syrup here are definitely a must-try! Much better than IHOP or Wildflower. I always make it a priority to order their orange juice as well, as it comes fresh-squeezed from the oranges that they keep stocked in the front of the restaurant.   Just as a heads up, if you plan on going on the weekends, make sure you go with enough time to spare because the place is ALWAYS PACKED! Not a huge problem though if you come with good company and good conversation.",

Butters caught my attention with it's vast menu and incredible looking omelets, pancakes, and more. After an early morning redeye and four hours of travel from Chitown I was famished.  There seemed to be a bustling crowd at this spot at nearly 8 am on a Friday! However, there was no wait for the al fresco dining option, which we gladly took. Upon being seated, we were immediately greeted. Our server was top-notch and helped me narrow down the immense menu.    I ordered the caramel macchiato and the chorizo omelet served with fresh fruit, and my choice of pancakes, cheesy grits, toast, english muffin, etc etc. I opted for the cheesy grits since my piggie of a fiance said he wanted to try them. The food came out so quickly, and it was made with super fresh ingredients. My chorizo omelet came smothered in jack cheese and green chile sauce. It had a little kick to it, but the cool and creamy avocados nestled inside were the perfect pair! The grits were smooth, cheesy and very flavorful!   I loved Butters and would recommend it to a hungry patron looking for quality food with a decent price tag!",

Yes; it is a long wait on the weekend but to me it's like \"Um duh; people go out to breakfast on the weekend! What do you expect?\" But I completely disagree with the people that say it's not worth the wait- IT IS; TRUST ME! This Scottsdale princess prone to extreme \"hanger\" (hunger induced anger if you aren't familiar with this term) would not wait for an hour on a Sunday if it wasn't worth it. Plus, once you're seated the service is actually super fast and they are good natured about customizing things which is good to know if you're picky like I can be.

The coffee was good, not great,....our waitress was flawless.   The negatives which are kind of not Butters fault is upon arriving at 10:30, which is kind of in between breakfast and lunch in theory, we experienced a 25 min wait. I guess this is the only breakfast place in the area. I'm from the west side so I dont know but a restauranteur could make some money opening up in the area and get Butters overflow. I very much enjoy Butters but I am not waiting 25 min for breakfast in the late morning during the week and would go elsewhere next time. For some reason the outdoor area was closed so I guess Butters could have done something about the wait times....because it was perfectly fine to eat outside weatherwise.     And because of the packed restaurant inside ....it was very loud so if that is a concern....this is not your place. And because so many people are waiting for your table....lingering is really not an option.     The other plus factor is it being north Scottsdale they do get some very hot women partaking in the cusine. Yum!",

The bacon was delicious, the oj and apple juice were meh (tasted like out of a jug), coffee was okay too. They didn't have any specials and I'm assuming they are known for their pancakes, however many appeared very sweet and i can't eat 3 cinnamon roll pancakes lol.

The wait was substantial, but we didn't call ahead. The food, it turned out, was well worth the wait.   Let's talk for a minute about these life-changing pancakes. You know when places offer \"specialty hotcakes\" and they're usually regular batter with junk dumped on top? That is not how it's done at Butters. Every pancake has its own signature batter recipe, in all these amazing flavors. Oreo? They bake the oreo into the pancake. They shove cream filling into the pancake. Whatever toppings you want are baked in and sprinkled on top. Like, what is this even? Heaven? That's right.   Hashbrowns were sliced up seasoned potatoes cooked to perfection, and the Irish Eggs Benny was such a brilliant idea. Nothing like corn beef on my eggs. Mmm-mmm good! Hollandaise sauce was one of the best I've ever tried, slathered liberally all over the top.    Three cheers for Butters. It's like breakfast at Grandma's house. Don't bring the diabetic grandkids.

My son and i had the blueberry pancakes which tasted great...until the inside of our mouths and throat  started to burn halfway thru the meal...we think the blueberries with whatever citrus juice they added to the sauce made it too acidic.  We had to stop eating it.  Im sure rest of menu is good.",

My husband and I liked it so much Friday that we decided to go back Saturday morning around 10:30am.

It is a very popular spot for those in town for 'spring training' so the wait can be a bit long but the system works very efficiently and fairly.  In fact, you can add your name to the 'wait list' on your way there! The menu is extensive and will adapt to any dietary needs: vegan, vegetarian, etc. and they don't charge an arm and a leg for egg whites!  The pancakes are delicious, the grits are creamy and the hash browns are crispy and perfectly cooked.  And the service, I haven't mentioned that: If you have decaf coffee, they keep track in the kitchen as to which tables has asked for it so come prepared to refill appropriately.  The servers come by frequently to ask how your food is and if there is anything you need.  The environment is clean, modern and airy and  the acoustics are such that you can actually carry on a conversation!  We highly recommend it!",

The place was packed - always a good sign - on a Friday morning around 10AM, so there was a 30 minute wait. That was fine because once we sat down the fun started. Just looking over the menu and looking at other people's orders was sort of fun, as goofy as that sounds.   I settled on the Hogs Gone Wild Scramble and upgraded to the Oreo pancakes. Wife ordered a different scramble and upgraded to the Wild Berry Pancakes. The upgrade is worth it. Once ordered, our food came quickly and was hot all the way through. I love how the potatoes were prepared in the scrambles: the right amount of potato taste and crispiness. Eggs were some of the fluffiest I've ever had, and there was meat in every bite of my Hogs Gone Wild. The Wild Berry Pancakes are filled with cream, drizzled, err drenched in an awesome glaze, and served with the freshest berries. The Oreo Pancakes are topped with crumbled Oreos and smothered with a marshmallow cream and chocolate sauce. As delicious as the Oreo pancakes were, it was a case of too much of a good thing, I only made it though half of my cakes. It's not very often I don't finish my whole meal, but this was one of those times.   Additionally, my seat allowed me a pretty good look of the kitchen and I noticed the cooks all had hair nets, even the guy who barely had any hair. There was one young lady who looked as though her job was to keep things clean and running smoothly. As a former food service worker, I appreciated what I saw. I would definitely recommend this place, and I look forward to coming again.",

Hostess needs to smile and be a bit more welcoming-too Frankenstienish if you ask me.   The hubby got the Irish Eggs Benedict with a side of cheesy grits, the twist on this dish was serving it up with corned beef hash instead of ham and if you're feeling nostalgic for the South you have a choice of sides and thankfully grits are on the menu.  Awesome presentation and very tasty.  I chose an eggless chorizo burrito-oh, my..every bite was sinfully delicious.  My only complaint is that the chorizo needs to drained of the greasy fat before serving. Our server was very upbeat friendly and hospitable.  Five stars for the service.  Kids had oatmeal and Mickey Mouse pancakes with a cup of cocoa.  All good and if you don't mind a noisy dining experience with super tight spaces but good food come here.

Irish Benny - For some reason, I've always loved the Irish fare of corned beef hash, but Butters restaurant decided to combine it ingeniously with eggs benedict, and voila! A match made in heaven! The hollandaise sauce covering eggs benedict with corned beef with a side of scalloped breakfast potatoes harmoniously complemented each other well, and I would not hesitate to order this dish again!  My hubby ordered the Mexicana omelet and the chorizo had just the right amount of spice. He couldn't stop talking about the right texture and fluffiness of his omelet either. He's always picky about how his omelets are prepared and they really hit the mark here!  Don't sweat the wait here, it is far worth it to experience breakfast here!

We wasted away this time at the coffee shop in the strip mall adjacent to Butters (which I recommend). Just want to be clear that though we had to wait, it's not reflected in my overall rating.  I ordered the California scrambler. It was meh. At the very least, it needed salt. The portion size was huge and could have easily been split between two people. I much preferred brunching at ALMA.  No booze onsite which makes brunching less fun.",

    "text": "Went with this brunch spot based on average reviews and was not disappointed.  Sunday at noon there was a wait, but that's to be expected.  The hostess was friendly and once we got seated our waitress made a few suggestions and the orders were placed.  Prices were reasonable, fresh squeezed OJ was delicious and not outrageously priced, and we shared the eggs benedict, New Mexico scramble and their wild berry pancakes with mascarpone...   A great eggs bennie almost always comes down to the hollandaise - and this was no exception, spot on delicious.  The hash browns were nice and crispy and the pancakes were delicious without being too sweet.  Service was great and my only suggestion when you come here is try to arrive before 9 to avoid the wait.  I'll be back for sure!!",

We polled a few people outside about what we should get and were given some great advice.  If/when I am in Arizona again, I will go here again for sure!!!

    "text": "*Disclaimer. If you are my future cardiologist please avert your eyes toward a different review*  Oh my dearest butters, you had me at your name, and I was oh so glad your food didn't disappoint. I'm sure this is in direct correlation toward your namesake being a main ingredient in all your dishes. Well, before I dive into how great the food is (so great by the way), let me get the frivolous details out of the way. First off, the interior is light and fun, the staff is great- couldn't be more on point, and the patio is large and dog friendly. Occasionally there can be a bit of a wait, so if you happen to go at primetime on a weekend don't be tempted to leave, they have no problem with you popping over to the Village Coffee Roastery for a one of the best lattes in town  (but that's a different review for a different time).   Ok, now down to business. I have eaten breakfast at Butters four times now and it's been a home run each time. In fact I've even turned other breakfast loyalists toward Butters for their new favorite spots. Whatever you order it comes out fast and hot. Lately I have been partial to the California scramble- eggs, grilled chicken, avocado, and cheddar. Other greats are the omelets- full of goodness and as big as your face. Even the traditionals (eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy, or breakfast burritos) hold their own as well. And the coup de grace, almost all the egg dishes come with your choice of pancakes!! Yes, you heard me right. Or you can even sub for French toast or a waffle. All of which are light and fluffy to perfection.   Long story short, if you like breakfast, this is your spot. Just bring your appetite cuz you're going to need it.",

Haven't tried the gluten-free Belgian waffles yet but that's next on my list.  When the weather is nice, it can be a 45 minute wait for first-available seating on Sundays (that's when my boyfriend and I go), but they do offer a coffee and juice bar while you wait.   I just wish they transformed more of their options to gluten-free.. I've been dying for some Eggs Benedict... Butters, please get some gluten-free English muffins so I can order some! :D",

I did today at this awesome breakfast spot. The food is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> period! I mean it was 12:00 p.m. and everyone was ordering breakfast.  The place is clean the customer service was top notch. They spoke so many times it almost became annoying. I really don't think you can go wrong here. Give it a go I think this is a sure bet.",

Our waiter said that this day was slow compared to other days and still we waited 25 minutes for a table. I don't care and I would've waited 2 hours for a table as this place ROCKS!!! My wife ordered the wild berry crepes and I had the banana nut crepes and while both were totally awesome, we both recommend the wild berry crepes. I think our waiter was named Rafeal and he was so patient and took care of us all the way through our \"first time\". Regardless of who waits on you, they are all excellent (so I was told). Go there, be patient and enjoy one of the best breakfast meals in the #VOTS (valley of the sun).",

Coffee was filled timely and waters were always topped off. Plus his suggestions were brilliant. Food: Since we wanted a mix of sweet (pancakes) and savory (meat and eggs) we decided to go with a scrambler (Santa Fe - Chorizo sausage, red jalapeno pepper, onion & cheddar cheese) and a skillet (New Mexico - Chorizo sausage, onion, green pepper, tomato & avocado). It comes with pancakes on the side (2) AND you can choose any of their special ones for a little upcharge...score! Wildberry Bliss Cakes - Stuffed with blueberries, layered with vanilla mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze...Banana Cream Cakes - Fresh bananas & cream, graham cracker pecan crumb & caramel... Everything was perfect! The savory was seasoned and flavorful. The pancakes were heavy, sweet and delicious.  Prices: Inexpensive. All this food, coffee and tea was less than $30 with tip...no lie. I guess I am used to NJ/NY prices... If you visit Phoenix, this is a must go for breakfast! ENJOY!",

    "text": "Butters is probably the most consistent breakfast restaurant in the area.  It is very popular on weekends and often a wait for a table.  But, the wait is well worth it.  The quality is excellent which has been consistent over the years.  The staff is friendly and efficient which keeps the wait times short.  The manager/owner Danny is always there which attests to the quality.      Breakfast meals are large often served with toast and other goodies.  The location makes this a popular place for the bicyclists who will stop by whose path is next to the Indian Bend Wash Recreation Path.    The place is bright and contemporary.  Absolutely spotless and well maintained.    Menu items include pancakes, eggs, omelets and crepes as well as fresh fruit with granola or oatmeal.  For those who prefer lunch items there is sandwich items as chicken sandwiches, french dip, burgers and salads.  During the summer make sure you have a glass of fresh OJ, and I do mean fresh squeezed, as the squeezing machine is on the left as you pass the front counter.  During the winter switch over to the hot chocolate.     For someone who loves the place and keeps coming back, why not five stars you ask?  My response is, \"They do so well with what they have, I'd like to see them create some specials for some old-times like me.\"",

With that said, I qualify myself as a discerning reviewer. I grew up in the restaurant business and currently manage my parents restaurant in Durango. I have flipped more eggs in my life than I care to think about. This has made me so picky about my eggs.   Back to Butters....  Being a Saturday there was a substantial wait. Greeted by nice staff ..we decided to hold out and wait after one of the staff (maybe a manager/owner) said that they get food out fast.  I can respect that.   Our waitress was very sweet when we were finally seated and prompt despite a 20 top she was working on. Coffee was delish!! We were very excited for the fresh squeezed OJ - yuuuuum! I had a skillet and was elated to see 2 beautiful over easy eggs. Not a touch of brown! Clearly they cook these in a fry pan and NOT on the grill (the best way!). They were beautiful. There's only about 2 restaurants a year that get this right! Thumbs up! The corn tortillas were also very delicious!  The staff hustled and was efficient! Our food came out about 6 minutes after placing our order (as promised)! Great presentation and tasted even better. The bathrooms and entire restaurant were very clean (another biggie for me).   Thank you for caring about what you do, Butters! It shows! For our last meal on our way out of town, I couldn't have been more pleased! We'll surely be back during our next visit to the area. We just happened to stumble on this place and so glad we did. From one restaurant-er to another - well done!",

We're very glad we did.  We were told up front there'd be about a 10 minute wait. Might have been that long, but I'm really not sure. While we were waiting, we were just so fascinated watching the staff work it just didn't matter. Once seated, we were greeted quickly by our server who got us fresh squeezed orange juice (we watched it being squeezed before we sat down) and coffee.  We both ordered the whole hog skillet (bacon, sausage, and ham on hash browns with eggs cooked to order). She had egg whites and a side of toast. I had eggs over easy and a side of pancakes, their signature dish. While the skillets were both great, the pancakes were even better. They were the lightest and fluffiest we've ever had.  Service was exceptional and the efficiency of the staff in turning over tables and serving food and drinks prompted us to pull the manager aside to compliment the crew. Eating here was a great start to a fun day.  Edited November 11, 2013: Five star review drops to three.  \"No substitutions.\"  In very tiny print at the bottom of their menu are the above two words. Today, my wife ordered breakfast to go which she's done many times. This time she asked for oatmeal with banana and cranberries, but wanted blueberries instead of cranberries. It was the first substitution she's asked for from them. She didn't see the very tiny print forbidding such a thing.  The person on the phone told her in no uncertain terms that they didn't do substitutions. Then, she backtracked. Seems they actually do substitutions if you're willing to pay an extra couple of dollars.  Now, that might not seem like much, but let's take a look at what she wanted to do.  Substitute blueberries for cranberries.  That's it.  These are reasonably comparable products as far as price goes.  There's no extra effort involved in using blueberries instead of cranberries aside from the person in the kitchen mixing the berries into the oatmeal having to pay attention to the order ticket.  So, why in the world does it cost $2.00 to to make such a substitution?  The only thing I can think of is the folks at Butters think so much of themselves and their exquisite taste in food combinations that to deign to stoop to the uneducated whims of their customers, they must penalize us for our horrid taste.  As high quality as their food and service generally are, I personally won't set foot in their restaurant again. I don't feel the need to pay extra to someone to insult me.",

First of all if you go on the weekend or a holiday there will be a wait for a table but let me tell you, it will be worth the wait. The service is lightning fast the wait staff are friendly and it's very clean. It's a noisy restaurant but not over the top. They have a nice patio too if you like alfresco. They squeeze their own orange juice and it's wonderful although a little on the expensive side. This is the only time a drink juice so I can overlook the price for a once in a while treat. I've tried many items on the breakfast menu and I've never been disappointed. I love the Smoked Salmon Scramble and also the Santa Fe Scramble with chorizo but all their egg dishes are great. Their hash browns are outstanding, made from scratch not out of a box. Pancake lovers you're in luck as theirs are fabulous. My personal fav is the banana pancakes. They are also opened for lunch but I have never eaten here for lunch. They're lunch menu does look pretty good though.",

My wife had a scramble with bacon, spinach and Monterey Jack cheese, and even the toast that accompanied it was above and beyond what most places pass off as toast.  Aside from the meal being top grade, I would say that the service here should be a model for all breakfast/brunch places to follow.  This is a very popular place, apparently, and they make it look so effortless to get everyone served promptly.  We were told the wait was 10 minutes, and it was probably five or so.  There was very little wait for the food to come out, and a new iced tea was put in front of me well before I had finished the current glass.  They have a huge staff, and they are all working hard and keeping up with the deluge of customers.",

The management and staff (Chris, Danny, Jessica and a lovely server Jane ) go above and beyond to make me feel like my business is appreciated! They knew me by name by the third time i went in there. Food literally takes 3-5 minutes to come out, and its always fresh and SO yummy. I always get the same thing, but have tried almost the entire menu. Space is clean, inside and outside seating available. Love love love this place. BEST OMELETS EVER! My husband and I are regulars, we go about twice a week. Great, great place. I can't brag enough!  **edited for a few notes- I've noticed people giving 1,2 and 3 star reviews for not being able to get in and seated WHEN they wanted to. This is Scottsdale, people! You can't walk in ANYWHERE on the weekends and expect to get seated in less than an hour. It's a smaller restaurant, and they do a killer job at getting people sat as soon as possible, without making the diners feel rushed. People also complained about not having the option for flavored creams- I am a breakfast PROFESSIONAL! (in my opinion. I just love breakfast food!) VERY FEW breakfast places offer flavored cream. If you're looking for a specialty coffee ,walk next door to the Village Coffee or go up the road to Starbucks. Giving a 2 or 3 star review for experience because you couldn't get french vanilla cream? Get over yourself. Servers offer flavored lattes if you don't like drip coffee (which theirs is local, and delicious). One guy gave a 1 star review because he just couldn't believe that it wasn't organic. THEY DON'T PRETEND TO BE ORGANIC. How many places can you go and find all organic, all natural food? You want to be that picky? Stay home, jerk. Another guy was mad they didn't have free coffee at the front. Again, where can you go and get a free drink just because you're waiting? Isn't a line a good sign a restaurant? READING THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABSOLUTELY INFURIATES ME. A bunch of closed-minded jackasses looking for a handout**",

    "text": "Ridiculously packed on the weekend. We came around 10:30am and were informed the wait was 45 minutes. Stick around, because often others are intimidated by the long wait and leave. Because of that our wait was only 25 min.  Butters serves your typical breakfast diner food. Menu is moderately extensive, prices are cheap.  Protein Power Pancakes (Wheat pancakes, blueberries, oats & almonds) - These pancakes tasted very healthy. They were full of blueberries, but I could not taste any almonds. I loved the texture from the oatmeal streusel sprinkled on top. Despite being wheat, the pancakes were pretty fluffy. I liked how they were smaller and decently sized instead of oversized pancakes as big as a large dinner plate that most diners in NJ seem to like serving.   Wildberry Bliss Pancakes (Stuffed with blueberries, layered with vanilla mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze) - I did not have this, but my dad and sister enjoyed it. Apparently, these pancakes were more fluffy with all that cream. The tastiest part was the top pancake with the vanilla cream on top.   Veggie Egg White Omelette - Large for sure, but it needed more of the vegetables it said it had. The omelette was disappointing.  Corned Beef Hash - I probably enjoyed this more than the pancakes. Really good to cut through the sweetness of the pancakes  Hash Browns - Crispy potatoes, can't go wrong.  Since this is your typical diner breakfast food, 25 min. wait is worth it. Any more than that, it probably wouldn't be worth it the second time. Go for the pancakes and corned beef hash, skip the omelettes.",

Our waitress was attentive however, it would be great if she would've been more suggestive of the menu items. There are so many awesome options on the menu that it was hard to make a choice. Especially after confirming that we'd never been there before. We waited about 30 mins for a table and opted to walk the perimeter to check out the shops in the area. But, once we were seated and ordered our food, the order came rather promptly and was served hot.  The food was Grreeat! It was in abundance and extremely flavorful. I opted for 2 scrambled eggs (more like 4 but, NOT complaining), potatoes (gotta try), bacon, and sub'd my toast for pecan pancakes ($.99 up charge but damn sure worth it!). Mr. B. had Swedish pancakes with bananas, pecans and some other additions that he felt necessary. Although I don't care for all the extras on my cakes, I found them very tasty (thin, and crisp with the right amount of sweetness).  We didn't mind the wait (we expect it in most places we frequent) and will definitely be back....several times.   A must try!",

Just had a 20 minute wait since we went late, but even that went by fast because it's spacious outside and the water fountain just makes the waiting easier. You can choose to wait inside too.   Food items: 1. Wildberry bliss French toast- We split this and it was delicious, everyone at the table loved it.   2. Garden Skillet- Can be made with your style, I got scrambled. It comes with toast or a pancake. I decided to get their specialty pancake for an extra $0.99 and choose the Oreo cookie s'mores, great decision, totally worth it. The skillet is served with a bed of hash brown potatoes which were soft but had crispy edges, basically perfect.  3. Freshly squeezed OJ- Other yelpers talked about it and glad I got it. I'm not even big on OJ.  Food was delicious, everybody was happy. Portions are big, at least for the girls at the table. Service was fast and friendly. Definitely would like to be back.",

We were seated in a booth and our waitress (Monica) promptly took our drink orders. We got Vanilla Lattes and they were definitely tasty. We put in our order of food and I wanted to test out the service by timing from when we put in our order to when our food came out. 3 minutes and 30 seconds. I was thoroughly impressed. We got the corned hash skillet and New Mexico skillet with upgraded pancake sides of the Oreo s'mores and the wild berry bliss cakes. The skillets were very light and you are able to customize how you want your eggs cooked. The skillets were balanced well and tasty. Our pancakes were literally the fluffiest pancakes we had tasted. I definitely recommend giving the cakes of any kind a try. The wildberry bliss was our favorite because of the refreshing side of fruit. Overall we will definitely be returning to try out more :)",

    "text": "Short story: the food is great, the service sucks. SUCKS. I'd love to give Butters a perfect review, but...no.  The food was delicious and you certainly get a LOT of it. I had the Popeye scrambler and added avocado with pancakes and cheesy grits. The scrambler was packed with the toppings, the pancakes were perfect, and the cheesy grits were like yummy mac 'n cheese with a creamy consistency.   The check was dropped off with the standard \"no worries, I'll take this when you're ready\" about 2 minutes after the food came. That should've been our first warning sign that they wanted our table for a big party that was waiting. Our waitress, Becca, never came back after that. We had to ask for refills of the coffee and then listen to her complain about how long we were taking about 6 feet from our table. Possibly in an effort to help move us along, the bussers began removing things from our table one by one the second there was one empty plate...water caraf, water glasses that we were still drinking from, syrup bottle, etc. After feeling really uncomfortable about sitting at our table, we got up to leave. As we did, Becca was coming out of the kitchen with another table's order. She turned back to the kitchen staff and said, \"Oh NOW they get up!\" I looked her in the eye and told her that was really rude. She looked away. My father-in-law spoke to the manager about it and was told they had 150 people waiting for tables, as if that were a good excuse for being openly rude to customers.  While good food is definitely what you go to a restaurant for, good service will make or break the experience. Considering this was breakfast, it was a total downer to start my day. Unfortunately, I won't be back any time soon.",

Yelp helps us - and we found this place well-reviewed, and decided to give it a try before watching the Cubbies lose to the hated, dreadful Padres.  Despite a slow start on last Saturday morning (we sat without service for about 10 minutes after the hostess seated us), this breakfast spot proved pretty much irresistible - great, light and fluffy eggs, simply amazingly light, non-greasy \"loaded\" hash browns (onions, peppers and a drizzle of cheese), pancakes that I would positively abuse if they were available to me on a daily basis, heavenly french toast with apples and pecan ... oh my my!!  (If only my eggs had been hotter when served, it would have been perfect.)  Clean, bright, kid-friendly restaurant, with the kitchen concealed with camouflage curtains (hiding the help?).  Once past the poor start, service was great  - prompt coffee refills and inquiries, water in a plastic carafe on the table, sugar-free syrup available at no charge (and yes, the menu does list 100% real maple syrup for a small extra charge - but the \"premium\", private label bottle on the table was great, too).  Great omelets, interesting combos, fresh squeezed OJ.  Friendly staff.  Decent, appropriate portions.  Everything tasty.    In short, everything you'd want for breakfast.  We'll be coming back next spring training trip!",

Also, our server, while very nice and prompt, was very thrown by a simple request my friend made. She wanted a cranberry juice with sprite mixed. The server said, I'm not sure if we can do that. I'm not sure to charge it as juice or soda. Do you want half and half, or more soda with splash of cranberry or more cranberry with splash of soda.... Huh? It should not have been that complicated, so we bristled about that a little.  Cute place. Solid brunch. I'm not opposed to coming back but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

We are very glad we did as everything met or exceeded our expectations, from being seated, the service, how prompt they were, politeness, and how delicious the food.    As we were leaving my wife made a comment that we must come back sooner than later as she wanted to try other items on the menu.  All in all we are going back there next weekend.    Cheers!",

The hashbrowns come out nice and fluffly yet crispy. They did everything in accordance to my request with such great service.  The pancake was actually very delicious. The wait was a bit long and they do not have a bar, which we usually prefer at breakfast joints. That was the only downfall for sure.   If we're ever in the area, we'd definitely be back!",

Came here around 10am and it was already pretty packed.. wait time around 20 mins.  Not so bad compared to places in LA.  As we were seated I ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, yum.  We debated away on the choices on their massive menu.  Our picks:  Whole hog skillet: one word... WOW! The hash browns were crunchy goodness with a buttery center and meats were good.  Topped with eggs made to your liking (I got a soft scramble).  One of the best breakfast skillets I have ever had!  2 egg breakfast with sausage & protein pancakes: My boyfriend got a more generic breakfast because he is watching what he eats.  He did mention the sausage patty was like McDonalds.. we all know Mcdonalds is not good for you but their breakfast sausage is amazing!  The eggs were cooked to his liking (over easy).  To his surprise he really liked the protein pancakes, syrup was not needed.    So far this place has blown my mind.. but we'll give it a few more tries and update this review :). But for now... we're coming back for more!",

Since it was a weekday, we didn't experience any of the crowds and were seated right away.  The restaurant itself is nice, nothing earth shattering, but it's nicely decorated and has a lot of light.  We experienced good service and were helped quickly and the food arrived quite fast.  Speaking of food, I had one of their skillets with mushrooms and bacon.  The mushrooms were delicious, as was the bacon.  The eggs were cooked to my liking and I felt this was a very solid choice.  The Hubs had the bananas foster pancakes and LOVED it.  He gobbled up the entire plate and has talked about it a few times since, so I'd say it was a success.  I've gotta say, this is one of the best breakfast spots we've been to in awhile.  I wish it was closer to our house, but then again, the waistline might now enjoy that.",

I ordered the California scramble which had chicken, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and jack, and it was very good.  The hash browns were phenomenal and unlike I've experienced at other places.  It's almost like slight hash brown texture with a scallop potatoes underneath.  I also had the cinnamon streusel pancakes.  They were delicious.  It wasn't overdoing it with the cinnamon and frosting because only the top pancake had the added ingredients.  My dining companion had the veggie scramble and regular buttermilk pancakes, and she was impressed.  Their pancakes are very good.    It's in a nice plaza by McCormick Ranch.  Solid property.  You are missing out if you haven't been to this place.  I will be back again and again.",

Growing up in the south, my mom made a huge deal of a Sunday breakfast and did not hold back at all.  While I can't eat like that anymore (or shouldn't), I appreciate a good breakfast joint.  This place was very solid.  We waited for about 30 minutes for a table to open up, but it was nice outside and there were plenty of other kids outside to keep mine entertained.   The other Yelp reviews are correct in that it is a very small place, but the food is really good and comes out almost as soon as you order it.  I got the chicken, avocado scrambler with egg whites which was great for anyone watching their intake.  It came with a side of pancakes and they also had some healthy options there as well.  The kids loved their Mickey Mouse pancakes and my wife devoured her french toast. A little pricey for a breakfast place, but you get big portions and it is no different than Snooze, Breakfast Club,...  Definitely will be back!",

    "text": "Butters is HANDS DOWN one of my new favorite breakfast/brunch spots in town and my only disappointment is that I didn't discover this place sooner!  I came here with five coworkers for brunch and ordered the \"build your own omelette\" deal and it was terrific. The omelette was enormous (honestly looked like at least 8 eggs!) and it came with breakfast potatoes and two large pancakes. They really do give you A LOT of food for $10 bucks which is becoming increasingly uncommon in Scottsdale.   I love that they don't \"a la carte\" you to death the way so many other brunching establishments do!  Anyway, I loved absolutely everything- the omelette was extremely tasty (could've used a bit more cheese though), the potatoes were lightly cooked (not burned to a crisp like so many places!) and really, really good. Also the pancakes were fluffy and flavorful.  Most of my coworkers ordered salad or sandwiches with fries and honestly I was salivating over their plates as well as mine. Everything looked SO delicious- especially the French fries. I must try those on my next visit!",

We ordered a Denver Omlet. We asked them to hold the onions and replace with jalapenos. For that we had to pay an additional charge. But they did not refund for no onions. If your looking for an intimate breakfast for two, this is not the place. The crowd on Sunday morning is like 75% children under the age of 3. Saturday is a little better, but I would sit outside. Overall the food is good. The restaurant seating is just very tight fitting. And if you like fresh squeezed orange juice, it's ok, a little sour and a large glass is $5.28.",

My choice was a spicy jack cheese. The entire dish is smothered in a YUMMY mexico green chile sauce. This is really outstanding.   Fresh OJ, Good coffee and the above dish couple with great service.

The waiting time, especially on Sundays around 10-11 am where all the Scottsdale population reunites for brunch. Fortunately they have a very efficient method: they take your name and phone number and notify you once your table is ready. So take my advice: go there and put your name down, then go do something else in the waiting time and come back when you get the call. This is less stressful that just get frustrated with an empty tummy.   Once you finally sit down then it's all fun time. The menu is amazing with plenty of options including sides. Coffee is good and freshly brewed and the service is quick. You can either sit inside or outside. Again, I'll come back here a million times if I can. Of course, if this place was a little bit bigger that would eliminate the waiting list issue. ;-)",

Got in and checked the menu.   I ordered the banana creme cakes, and it was the best pancake I've ever had by a country mile. Thick and fluffy cakes topped with bananas, graham cracker crumbs and a creme sauce. About two-thirds a way into it, I thought to myself, \"damn, self, you didn't even put syrup on this.\" Didn't need it. It was so outstanding, I'm thinking about my next trip to Scottsdale already.   A breakfast game changer.   A+, 5 stars.",

We decided to go for breakfast after pulling an all-nighter last weekend reached around 6:25 and I kid you not there were people waiting already.  We choose to sit inside but they have a beautiful patio that gets filled up by 7:00 I am relieved when a restaurant is filling up quickly just says a lot about the place.  ~ Banana cream cakes (stack of 3) $9 (Fresh bananas & cream, graham cracker pecan crumb & caramel) ~ Veggie Omelette $10  (tomato, onion, mushroom, green pepper, cheddar cheese) Each additional item .25 ~Classic Brioche $8 you can add a Fruit for $1.99 ~ Iced Americano $3  Great Food and Ambience The only reason I stop at 4 stars is the service it could be friendlier. I'd rather see smiling faces, especially in the morning.  Cheers!",

We went on a weekday morning, the staff was very friendly and all of the employees had a smile on their faces.  You can taste the difference in food when the people making and serving it enjoy what they do.  We decided to split two meals so we could both try more of the flavors this delightful breakfast place had to offer.   We had split a make your own omelet with chorizo, bacon, onion, and red jalapeno..  The flavor of the bacon was not overwhelmed by the chorizo and it wasn't too greasy like you often get with a chorizo omelet.  The eggs were light and fluffy, and made a nice balanced omelet with the ingredients that were chosen.  The hash browns were crispy on the outside and not just mush on the inside.  Great Start!!!  Then for a wonderful finish we split the cinnamon roll pancakes...  It was amazing, the texture was so light and delicate, I was impressed as to how they managed to take an oversized cinnamon roll and flatten it without damaging the fluffy integrity of a delicious roll.  The frosting was great and balanced with hints of citrus.  Everything about our experience was fantastic and our only regret is that it is too far from us!!  This is one of the best breakfast places either of us have ever been to and would definitely return and recommend.",

It's open and airy, the staff is friendly and fast and the food is fantastic. Oh and did I mention that the patio is dog-friendly? All pluses in my book! Since so many of the reviews are about breakfast, I am going to talk about lunch!  Their wraps are amazing. The tortilla bread is soft and fresh and the combinations are mouthwatering. I ordered the Southwest Veggie Wrap with the addition of turkey. The wrap has Black beans, jalapeno cheese, corn, red bell pepper, avocado, scallion, lettuce, tomato & chipotle mayo. Every bite is better then the one before it. For my side, I splurged and ordered the sweet potato fries. Oh sweet happiness, I am so glad I did! The lunch was heartier than I typically opt for in the middle of the day, but when the food is this good, it doesn't quiet matter as much!   The server was friendly and efficient. In fact, I had only had 1/3 of my Diet Coke and she brought me out a new one! That's service. This is definitely a eatery that shouldn't be missed.",

It's all glass / ceramic. Waiters were good enough to check on the table time to time. Presentation was good too.",

The food and service however, was WORTH the wait! I was pleased to see gluten free pancake options, which is not only rare at most breakfast establishments, but notoriously difficult to perfect in the kitchen. These guys nailed it! I had the cinnamon roll gluten free pancake option with the chorizo scramble, and while my digestive tract wasn't a fan of all the rich, high fat goodness, I was in food heaven! The pancakes were rich and moist, and the texture was a glorious work of art.  My husband isn't a fan of waiting to be seated at restaurants, so he kicked and screamed the whole time. I didn't know there was an option to add yourself to the waitlist on Yelp, so I'll do that next time. Either that or come in early, since the place opens before 7am anyway! I will be back. Oh yes. I will be back! 4 stars because of the wait.",

    "text": "Summary - Breakfast done right and at an unbeatable price. Come here, get the pancakes and eggs, you will not be disappointed. (Pro tip - use the Yelp waitlist feature it will save you a 30-minute wait and seriously, get the pancakes)          My friend and I were craving brunch last Sunday and decided to splurge on a breakfast out. Having read really positive reviews about this place we decided to go. Upon seeing a 45-minute wait in the Yelp app I joined the waitlist and we hung out until closer to our appointment. While it was a bummer waiting that long for what is surely one of the best breakfasts in the valley, the app nailed the exact wait time.   We already knew what we were going to order when we sat down. I had the two eggs scrambled with bacon, fruit, and a side of pancakes. My friend ordered the same, but with sausage.  The friendly waitress quickly took our order and we waited for our food to arrive. It did not take long! Service was super quick.  The 2 scrambled eggs were super fluffy, almost like they had been whipped for a long time. Absolutely light, airy, and delicious. The bacon was thick cut and had a great crunch to it. Definitely not a microwaved afterthought, but an integral part of the meal. The fruit tasted fresh and my friend who ordered potatoes was happy to report that they were crisp and fried, not greasy and gross.  Now the pancakes were on another level and deserve their own paragraph. Each food order comes with 2 regular pancakes or 2 specialty pancakes (for a little extra).  I ordered the OG normal pancakes and was pleasantly surprised by how light, fluffy, and frankly delicious they were. You have to get the pancakes.  My friend ordered the chocolate chip strawberry variety and was a little disappointed that the chocolate chips were not cooked into the pancakes, but placed on top next to the strawberries. In the end it really did not matter as the flavor combination was out of this world and he quickly devoured them. While the other flavors looked heavy, I am sure they are delicious and trying all of the different items on the menu will give me an excuse to come back!",

We went around 915am and only had to wait about 15 min because we checked in on yelp.  I'm Celiac and need gluten-free and they were very accommodating.   They have a drink bar for ordering while you wait and we got a wild berry smoothie, strawberry smoothie and a black coffee. The strawberry smoothie was very flavorful and tasted like it was made from yogurt.  The server was very accommodating and knowledgeable about gluten-free. I wasn't able to do the gluten-free pancakes or waffle because they are done on the same grill and waffle irons, but there were quite a few options on the skillets, omelettes, scrambles, etc.  I went with a Mexicana Omelette but couldn't do the New Mexico Green Chili sauce because it sounded like it wasn't gluten-free. It was still very good and the chorizo flavor was fantastic. My wife got the 2-egg breakfast with sausage, hash browns, and 2 blueberry pancakes. She was happy with her breakfast and said the pancakes were good but the blueberries were just bunched in the middle of the pancakes. Definitely would have been better if they took the time to spread them out a little more evening across the pancakes.   Overall the breakfast was very good, we'll be back for breakfast or brunch sometime soon!",

Okay so the weekend wait times at this place are pretty horrendous (we waited about an hour with only 2 of us), but I had read the reviews and knew that before coming. Prepare ahead!!! Get on the waitlist through Yelp as soon as you are within five miles of the building. There's shopping nearby and also a nice little park where we waited directly in front of and to the left behind the buildings with benches and a nice little pond. This place is extremely popular so don't expect to walk up and get immediate service on a weekend.  Now let's get to the actual dining experience. The ambiance here is very casual. Our waitress we got was very friendly and efficient. So many items to choose from on the menu but my friend and I both gravitated to the Mexicana omelette. This was probably the best omelette I've had in Phoenix. The chorizo was amazing, the eggs perfectly cooked and fluffy. You've got to try this dish! I opted for the spicy jalapeno cheese and pancakes for my side. Everything was absolutely delicious. The portions were awesome! The price was very affordable! I can see why this place is so popular.  All in all this place is one of the best spots for brunch in the area if you don't mind waiting a bit. Sometimes good things are worth the wait! I will be coming back to try some of their famous pancakes!",

    "text": "We've been going to Butter and their other restaurant on Shea.  When Butterfield's changed from making prepared hash Browns, we thought what a mistake.  They make their own, but darn the prepared ones were far superior in taste.  If I am having an omelette, I want Hash Browns that are not only Browned, but I want them hot and crisp. The others cannot compare to these Hash Browns they are making in their own commissary.  These are limp, brown and tasteless.  The Benny is still good, and i ordered fruit instead.  But Hash Browns were our preference.  My husband had the California Scramble and Hash Browns that he left on his plate.  So, I think it's time to try another restaurant that makes delicious Hash Browns that are crisp and better than these, and hopefully the rest of the breakfast will be as good.   The noise level in the new place is pretty bad.  They have nothing in the way of acoustics, so you definitely have a hard time hearing. Our server was very capable and on top of things.  She seemed to know about the Hash Browns and sent over the manager, who basically said they were busy and they were fresh....So, we will move on!",

The whipped butter on the cakes was to die for. The eggs look a little strange but trust me, try them they were amazing as well.   Ambiance/ noise level: almost couldn't be worse. The noise level inside is intolerable. No exaggeration it is easily as loud as a club. This is one of the noisiest restaurants I've ever been in. We HAD to go outside. I think we would have had to leave if outside wasn't an option.  Suggestion: please get noise reducing panels or something, anything, to reduce the noise. It ruins the dining experience.",

Omelets are huge, fluffy and bright yellow with no brown. Hash browns are large slices, like potato chips; just as thin and golden brown. Grits are as white and beautiful as Anderson Cooper's butt cheeks in the winter. (conjecture) And the pancakes. Ah, the pancakes.  Dusted with powdered sugar in a way that only my mother could make.  The real triumph in all of this are the grits.  I'm thinking the calorie count has to be equal to the square root of infinity but who cares, god bless america, the chef, Martha (fucking) Stewart, my waitress and anyone else who had a hand in these natural wonders.  I see myself ordering buckets of grits for takeout, going home and eating them until I shoot grit shrapnel out of my ass like an exploding space nebula. I'd aim at the neighbors dog - Casper.

Came here around 9:45 on a Friday after our hike at Camelback and did not expect there to be a wait on a working weekday. The wait was about 20 minutes for 2 people, reasonable for a seemingly popular brunch place.  I got the country benedict which was basically biscuits, sausage patty, gravy, and poached eggs with a choice of hash browns or grits. Biscuit and gravy was yummy. My boyfriend got the corned beef hash skillet, which came with a side of either toast or pancakes (he chose pancakes). We also ordered wildberry french toast to share.  Everything was amazing and totally fulfilled our brunch cravings. Wildberry french toast had a drizzle of fruit and vanilla syrup and was stuffed with mascarpone cheese. It wasn't too sweet or too egg-y, just the right amount of sweet fluffiness.  They have their own bottled syrup for the pancakes too! You can also order a coffee from the front barista to enjoy while waiting for a table, and black coffees get free refills once you get seated.",

The green chile sauce was bright and decently spicy.  Interesting take on hash browns.  Rather than the typical grated potato, these were very thinly sliced.

We were seated before expected and as we browsed the menu an employee stacking chairs asked if we needed any assistance with the menu, to my surprise he was able to answer all of my questions and made note that he was the only restaurant that cracked their own eggs and his coffee was from a local coffee shop just down the street. No longer after we ordered, my coffee was topped off twice and the meal was on the table. The breakfast was excellent, service staff was very professional and efficient. All hand selected by the man stacking chairs.   On the bucket list for my next trip to Scottsdale AZ",

I came here with my compadres Roland (who also reviewed this place), Jenna and Shaun.  Place is in a very nice shopping center, not too far down the road from Jimmy John's (drool).  Let me start with the food.  Something like Strawberry Cheesecake French Toast.  My mom would kill me if I told her it's better than her Creme Brulee French Toast or her Grand Marnier French Toast, so I just won't say anything.  But it is AMAHHHZING.  I ordered a side of sausage and a side of bacon, and I shouldn't have ordered either.  They were also amahhhzing, but the entree was enough to fill me up.  Needless to say, I took a huge nap afterwards.  Every time I see Jenna and Roland check-in without me on Yelp, they get angry texts from me.  This Wednesday I'm having brunch at Butterfield's on Scottsdale and Shea...I'm told it's same ownership?  We shall see if it compares to the deliciousness that was Butters.",

And thanks to the staff here it was flawless.  Before my drive back from the day after the Super Bowl where my Seahawks lost I was feeling down.  Looking to Yelp to find some comfort food before heading back to Los Angeles I find this place that was highly reviewed.  We walked in and immediately was greeted with a smile by the hostess and was whisked away to our table.  Within moments our waitress \"Monica\" greeted us with a smile and took our drink order.    When our food was delivered within 10 minutes and (I had the eggs Benedict) I found the poached egg to be PERFECTLY cooked.  The flavor clean and what was expected from a perfect Eggs Benedict.    After finishing the helpers pre-bussed while Monica kept on coming back to make sure we were taken care of.  We were in and out in less than 30 minutes (although we could've stayed longer we wanted to leave AZ as fast as we can to get back).  Nevertheless I will be back in 2 weeks for Breakfast.  Every entrepreneur should look at the way this place is run as a case study of how to run a restaurant.",

It is a very good place to enjoy a long, lazy brunch facing the fountains (if you are lucky). However, long is the key word here. The wait is quite long on weekends and they don't take reservations beforehand. Pity the mall it is located in doesn't have much to kill time in (everything else is also an eating joint!) but the fountain made for some good backdrop for taking selfies.. :)  On the food, we ordered the Garden skillet, Egss Rojo/Verde and the buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes win hands down, the best I have had. The other two are decent but not the best I have had. Do go for a long lazy brunch and have sufficient time to go take a nap afterwards.",

I ordered the egg breakfast with the Oreo smores pancakes and my boyfriend had the same but with chocolate chip pancakes.  We both didn't like the hash browns it reminded us of baked potatoes and we're not impressed with out pancakes.

It was a little too sweet with the cream in the middle so we just ate around it. But plenty of berries no need for syrup and oh so moist and fluffy. I would for sure come back for more pancakes! We luckily didn't have to wait since we came on a Thursday morning around 10am. If the wait is longer than 40min, I would probably pass. But check this place out. And get the pancakes!!!",

We chose the California Omlette and for $1.50 up charge we added premium pancakes which we chose wild berry. Eggs were delicious and the pancakes were very tastie. We were able to choose GF option with the pancakes. Will return.",

Everything from pancakes, omlettes and eggs to French toast. The potions here are as large as the selection.  A typical omelette comes with your choice of three added ingredients, hash browns (better if they are well done/crispy) and your choice of pancakes or toast.  For a minimal up charge of $1.50 you can upgrade to a signature pancake like cinnabun or pecan.  All options are delicious and a great add on especially if you're sharing. Butters has amazing orange juice and coffee.  They are menu highlights and not to be missed.  Although I think the speed has improved and the foid is the same great quality in their new location, I have to say I miss the charm of the old location. A special shout out to our server Alex, who on our second trip in recognized us.  She was a delight and took very good care of us plenty of coffee and good menu selections.",

It is clear the waitress who served my friend and I had one mission : to get my friend and I out the door as fast as possible. She never came by to offer my friend and I more coffee, but other waitresses did and when I asked her to refill my cup, she said she'd fill it to go. Thanks for pushing us out the door.  I'd prefer eating elsewhere. Noci, Snooze, First Watch - all those places kindly allow eaters to chat and not feel rushed out the door.",

With a lot of Thanksgiving cooking to do today, we figured we'd spare ourselves the hassle of breakfast dishes so we came here and have NO REGRETS... literally, in life. Hahaha. Seriously though, their freshly squeezed OJ was fantastic, not too sweet or sour, just perfect. I have the Banana Creme French toast, which was literally the most delicious french toast I have ever had. When the waitress asked me if I was done so she could take my plate, I told her she'd better before I starting licking the plate. She laughed, thinking I wasn't serious. My husband had the Wildberry Bliss Pancakes, which my husband is NOT a pancake person but he finished his food faster than I did. Luckily, I got a bite of his and for once, our food tied on whose was better. When asking him how it was, he has no words... then finally replied, \"Two thumbs waaaaaaay up. Great combination of berries, mascarpone sauce.\" Overall- great experience. Great service. Nicely priced! Will definitely return soon.",

And off to Butters we went.  Looking up directions on my phone, I took a double take when I saw the Sunday wait times at 10AM - you're looking at a 45 minute wait. And as much as I love my best friend, I really would rather not stand around and wait for a table (much rather sit around with food, honestly. With a mimosa or bloody mary). Thankfully, and boy am I thankful, you can put your name in via Yelp which basically is like giving your hostess a heads-up that you're on your way and you've got yourself a place in line!  Getting to Butters, it was packed - I saw someone walk away after hearing about the 45 minute wait and I was secretly glad that I chanced upon the check-in function via Yelp. All-in-all, we waited for 15 minutes after letting the hostess know we've arrived before we were seated.  Fast forward to the food - I went with my waitress' favorite, the Mexicana omelette which is wonderful if you're a chorizo fan. It's packed with avocados and chorizo, wrapped in an omelette and did I mention, your choice of melted cheese? I went with pepper jack. You also get a choice of grits or hash browns (hash browns, please) and pancakes or toast (pancakes, duh). You'll also have the option to upgrade to a specialty cake for $1.50 which means you get to choose one of the fancy pancakes in place of the buttermilk pancakes they would otherwise serve you on the side. That option right there, won me over. A little odd pet peeve I have about brunch places is that they either serve you a plate full of sweets (so think Belgian waffles or 3 giant pancakes) without any sort of savory goodness (like eggs or bacon). Or they serve you up a hearty breakfast (think corned beef hash or country fried steak) with a measly side option of sweets (maybe jam on toast). I'm greedy - I want both. And Butters had just that - a hearty omelette, with hash browns, the perfect medium to eat hot sauce, and decadent pancakes, where I went with a stack of two apple cinnamon pecan caramel pancakes. I could've done with even more caramelized apples and pecans but I tend to overdo things - the amount of apples and pecans topping my pancake stack was perfect. They even had pecan pieces mixed into the pancake itself, which added a nice little nuanced texture to my pancake.  In a nutshell, a little far but totally worth the drive. Definitely check-in beforehand, and always upgrade to a specialty cake. Five out of five and of course, a keeper!",

Pro tip: sub your toast for pancakes and pay the up charge for a specialty cake of your choice - our waitress recommended the Berry Bliss and I see why. It was SO good! By husband was jealous - he ordered the banana which was also good, but just creamy and sweet if that's what you're into. The berry cakes had berries cooked into them, topped with fresh berries and layered with a creamy goodness that tasted like cheesecake. We both got skillets  so good. He got the meat one and loved it, I got the Mexican one + jalapenos... worth every calorie. Also, fluffiest eggs ever.",

Went on a Sunday morning around 11am so yes there was a wait but I did the Yelp check in and it was very useful in adding my name to the list and both texting and calling me when my table was ready. Parking actually was pretty convenient for us but I can see how it may be a competition for spots in the lot.   I ordered scrambled eggs, grits and a banana crunch pancake. The food was so good. Eggs were scrambled to perfection and the pancake was a buttermilk fluffy sugar coma.   We sat outside and the chillers were on making it actually slightly cold but I'll take that over burning up in the hot AZ weather.  The waitress was very attentive and nice, the food cake out pretty quick and it's decently priced.  I really enjoyed brunch here and would definitely come back and try more varieties of pancakes.",

I do not think I will ever visit a better breakfast place again. As I was thinking up this review, as usual I thought of what was wrong with it. I couldn't think of anything. This totally beats out iHop. This restaurant is perfect, and I never say that.",

They keep it simple so if you're looking for a super hip, trendy place that does a deconstructed French Toast served on a piece of driftwood, this isn't the place. If you're looking for a solid breakfast and some of the best pancakes around, get in here. Big portions and not that many low cal options so bring your appetite and leave you new year's resolution at home :)",

    "text": "I had my first visit at Butters Pancakes & Cafe today and I found myself another favorite place! First off, I love the location. The east side of the restaurant has a patio area that's exposed to the rising sun, which makes it a particularly great place to have breakfast. There's even a fountain to add to the welcoming feel of the environment. Today was a particularly great day to eat breakfast outside due to the cool weather and the effects of rain coming or going or in between. Where the patio area is situated truly takes advantage of the great weather we have hear in the Valley.  The food was great! I savored my Irish Benny. The coffee was awesome! I already had a coffee on my way to Butters, but on this particular day and this particular weekend in general, I needed some extra caffeine help. I asked for cream for my coffee and our waitress provided a little individual pour cup with cream, but I had a chance take a couple of sips before the cream was laid on the table and I found the coffee is great on it's own and is best on it's own.   I first thought of Butters by driving by it a couple of times. When I looked it up on my Yelp app, I found that I had already bookmarked it is having potential in my near future. So glad to find new places to love and will definitely visit again.  Here's my tip: When I left around 8 AM, there were people waiting outside. I wasn't thinking about the Sunday morning crowd so I was just lucky to have come in early. Be ready to wait if you're determined to have breakfast here Sunday in the AM.",

The wildberry pancakes are the best dang pancakes I have ever had and I'm partial to my own. They are surprisingly not very sweet, but just right. The mascarpone cream center is drool worthy. Let's not forget the most perfect fluffy eggs and crispy hashbrowns. All 3 of us licked our plates clean. Not one crumb left. Also, if you are worried about the wait, don't be. The food comes out so fast I seriously don't know how they do it. I don't even think it took 10mins! They are miracle workers.",

Must say that the over easy eggs were perfectly prepared. This item should be removed from the menu. Corporate Butters, do you hear me? I only gave  2stars (rather than 1) because of the hope their other menu items are great. Potential is there and staff do well.",

It was really busy and we had to wait a little bit over an hour but after everything was done, I definitely felt that it was worth it.  Firstly, I thought our waitress did a great job the entire time we were there. She was on top of taking our orders, keeping our cups filled with drinks, etc. There was a variety of items ordered at our table and per recommendation I ordered the Wildberry Bliss Toast. It wasn't a very long wait before we got our food and everything looked awesome. After only the first bite of french toast, I was totally hooked. It was a bit sweet but not overwhelming so; the mascarpone in the middle offset some of the sweetness too and it made for some really delicious bites.  Everyone seemed really pleased with the quality and quantity of food that was served to us. I'd love to return here & bring some more friends to enjoy the deliciousness!",

Service has always been speedy and the portions are huge!  Good gluten free pancakes as well.",

I ordered the Nova Lox Platter consisting of Smoked nova salmon, tomato, onion, cucumber, capers, cream cheese & a toasted bagel. It was divine! The portion is huge and the cost is very fair ($10.95). I also tasted the Country Benny with Poached eggs, sausage, biscuit & white country gravy. Amazingly light considering the ingredients. The noise level is pretty high, but it is a great place to start your day. The patio looks great, but it was too hot when I was there...",

I've been craving that damn skillet since I've had it. Isn't it a little odd to crave chorizo and eggs? Idk. Seems a lil weird to me. But clearly it made an impression.",

Although we had a large party of 6 we got seated in only a few minutes.  (After walking out there was already lines of people outside so we got very lucky).  Walking to our table we noticed they have a True coffee bar with locally roasted beans so you can get your cappuccino fix.  There's also a fresh squeezed orange juice machine that pumps out amazing OJ...you finally get what you pay for in this liquid gold.  The restaurant was clean but felt like a run of the mill pancake house...I should have known otherwise by the passion in the OJ and coffee.  We ordered just about everything on the menu but the one thing that stuck out in my mind were the side of pancakes that came with my meal.  I don't even like pancakes...I'm a waffle guy but the pancakes with mascarpone are to die for!  The mascarpone they put between the pancakes offers a creaminess without too much sweetness.  While filing out of the restaurant we noticed SF Giants star outfielder Hunter Pence waiting in line for a table (I bet they didn't notice it was him  :) ).  He was super kind to take a picture with my mother-in-law but the point is that he was willing to wait in line to eat here...you should too.  I will ensure a trip up here each time I visit Phoenix.  This is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten at breakfast in my life.",

Tend to get mushy with syrup but very good.  But I tend to be hard on flapjacks.  Because Bisquick.  Extra points for having chorizo, corned beef hash, and being able to effectively subtract onions from my order.  Really no trace, that is remarkable.

Food arrived in 5 minutes. Came by 3 minutes after that asking if she could get a box for the food I had just started eating. Left the check. Now I am uncomfortable. Out of there and driving away in less than 10 minutes. Seemed like this young girl has not had a job before, not trained, and is socially awkward. Needs to lose the stinkeye.

Tables were a little cramped but I can understand wanting to pack em in. If you build it, eaters will come!  Iced coffee was delish, and refills came without asking. I settled on a breakfast sammie of a soft, chewy bagel (hate when sandwich bagels are gigantic and hard. Not great when sandwich filling starts flying everywhere!) with over hard eggs, cheddar and I subbed avocado instead of bacon. TREAT CITY. My side of fruit was awesome as well: berries, pineapple, melly and oranges. It was a colorful, pretty accompaniment to my fat kid main dish.  Boyfriend got a MONSTROUS Mexicanish omelet filled with chorizo, jalapeno cheese (awesome that this is a choice for cheese), veggies and topped with a green chile sauce. Wonderment. Holy. I triied a bite (or 3. Or 4.) of his perfectly outside-crispy, inside-fluffy hash browns with the sauce and almost died.  Service was quick and friendly. I promptly went home and napped HARD.

Creamy and a bit cheesy, excellent!!  My husband had the banana nut bread french toast-WOW!!  And our two 6 yr old twin girls devoured their pancakes and scrambled eggs.

The portions and dishes are big however, the tables are small. The servicer was excellent!   I ate indoors during winter and the constant in and out of waiters from the patio certainly gapped the difference in air environment  to match  the out door temperature.   The indoor cafe provides a cozy setting but can be restricting  to a larger framed person.   If your looking for a decent breakfast, have time to spare and enjoy a cozy envirinment don't hesitate - and during your wait you can catch up on your reading while waiting for the efficent app to notify you of your position in line.",

    "text": "I have been to Butters a couple of times since my previous review. I think it is important to mention that the lines here really are long on weekends and holidays. Expect to wait a while with a buzzer to notify you when a table is ready.  They move patrons through pretty rapidly and the service is very efficient. Despite the rush, our waitstaff has always been very attentive and never hurried us through our meal. The food on the other hand does seem to be a bit rushed sometimes, though I can't say I blame them given the demand and long lines of patrons. Although the food is good (despite the seemingly hurried preparation) it is not worth waiting 40+ minutes for it in my opinion.   The grits are standard fare, the pancakes are good but nowhere near the best I've had. The stuffed french toast tends to be on the soggy side. The smoothies are really quite good, especially the strawberry one. The omelettes are kind of hit or miss. Sometimes the ingredients are distributed poorly and you get a super cheesy area while the rest of the omelette is packed with onions or peppers. It may largely depend on who is in the kitchen that day or how rushed they are, but I like my omelettes to be packed with ingredients that are up in each other's business.   The Mexican Egg Burrito is pretty good and filling if you are hungry, but again nothing to write home about. I have tried it with both chorizo sausage and plain sausage and either way it seems to taste about the same. Maybe it's just me. If you like your fiod smothered in chile sauce then I highly recommend the Eggs Verde.  Some of Butters' best items are their fresh squeezed OJ, their fresh smoothies, and their delicious coffee. Their hashbrowns are pretty solid too, and if you want a good filling meal then the omelettes are not a bad way to go but make sure the cook really tosses the ingredients before wrapping everything up! I also highly recommend their benedicts as they are very tasty.",

To our surprise they had crossed our name off  the list and the pager did not go off because it was dead or something wrong with it. We were upset and asked if they could give us the next available table due to their flaw. The host was mean and said she could add us to the list again and we could wait 20-30 minutes. Sorry, but we will not wait 1.5 hrs to eat when you screw up.

    "text": "Butters Pancakes & Cafe is the perfect place to come to if you're craving some good 'ole breakfast. They offer lunch, as well, but when I went I had some of their breakfast items from their menu.   I ordered an iced caramel latte along with their country benny, which is eggs benedict with sausage on a biscuit and covered in gravy. The dish comes with a pork sausage, however, I was able to swap out the pork for chicken. The chicken sausage was extremely tasty and the dish overall was very hearty. I had it with a side of home fries. You also have the option of getting grits instead.   I also tried my friend's banana cream cake (pancakes), which were to DIE FOR! Imagine a stack of pancakes with bananas, cream, and caramel all over. If you get a skillet, they're only $1 extra if you add them on. I would definitely try a stack if I were you.   There is plenty of parking near the establishment since it is located in a plaza.   I can't wait to go back here the next time I visit Arizona!   FYI - Krista was an amazing waitress! She was extremely friendly and super attentive. Ask for her next time you're there.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Great, solid breakfast.  Especially in comparison to the breakfast we had at TC Eggington's yesterday.  (See review if you want.)  We both got 2-egg breakfasts with hashbrowns and pancakes, I also ordered bacon.  For an extra $1, you can upgrade to their premium pancakes, which we did.  Blueberry and banana cream.  Bacon was quite good.  Thick cut but still had some crisp edges.  Eggs were fine.  My wife ordered hers hard scrambled for the first time in a long time and regretted it.  Says she should have stuck to over-hard.  The hashbrowns were not shredded potato, but more like slivered potato.  There were crispy, browned bits which I appreciated, but I'm still ambivalent towards them.  Doctored them with Cholula hot sauce and they were fine.  The pancakes weren't necessarily the star, but were a very good addition.  Fluffy but still had some chew to them.  Didn't disintegrate upon spreading butter over them or pouring over the syrup.  They have sugar-water for syrup on the table, you can buy real Vermont maple syrup for $1.25.  This is a little steep but worth the purchase compared to the cheap stuff on the table.  My banana cream pancake was not overly sweet with some good cinnamon flavor coming through the cinnamon crumbles, the bananas were soft and sweet and the cream negated the need for syrup.  My wife enjoyed her blueberry pancakes - which were both in the pancake and a good number off to the side.  She said nit the best pancakes she has ever had, but pretty darn good.  The coffee is decent too.  Nothing special, just decent.  So for a superior breakfast, we spent less here than we did yesterday at TC Eggington's - and that was WITH upgrades - so the value is also pretty good here.  We would definitely come back here..",

I wanted something a little healthier that day so I got a build your own omelette. I had egg whites with avocado and spinach, and substituted fruit for potatoes.   Quite possibly the best thing about this place is you can get pancakes instead of toast on the side. No upcharge. PANCAKES! And those pancakes are fluffy and delightful and I want some now.

For 9 people the prices were more than reasonable! And excellent service requires a amazing tip which I was more than happy to give with how satisfied I was eating here!!!!!",

    "text": "I've been to Butters five times now, and it's gotten progressively less impressive. The 30 minute plus wait in the heat, extremely loud interior, feeling like I'm being rushed out of my table...and the quality of the food is incredibly variable (sometimes, the has browns are soggy and undercooked. The next weekend, half of them are burned. IHOP has more consistent quality).  Yes, the eggs Benedict is delicious and the OJ is awesome, so it's not the worst place to eat, especially for first timers.   Despite all of the problems, and feeling that the waitresses absolutely do not want to be there, I kept coming here for the Wildberry Toast.  However, they completely changed the recipe. As of last Wednesday, there is no longer a Wildberry filling, instead, they placed the cream topping between two slices of French toast, and sloppily drizzle some of the Wildberry topping from the previous version.  The menu doesn't reflect the changes (yet).   Butters could be so much better--with more attentive wait staff and attention to quality of the food. Unfortunately, I'll be looking for a new Scottsdale breakfast location for now.",

To start off, I love the fact that you can put yourself on the wait list when you are on the way to the restaurant. Second, the service was so great. Our waitress was on it the entire time. Lastly, I really like the fact that the manager was present in the dining area and was checking in with the customers and making sure we were all satisfied. This behavior from the manager really shows he is concerned with making sure his staff provide excellent service. We ordered the brioche french toast, the baked potato omelet, a biscuit with sausage gravy and a meat skillet. The French toast was crispy on the outside and perfectly dipped. The omelet was very filling and tasted just like a baked potato. The meat skillet was cooked perfectly. The biscuit/gravy was flaky and not dry at all. We will be back on our next visit to Scottsdale!",

A fee minutes later we where called and i told her he had just parked the car and was walking up, i could see him through the window maneuvering the crowd outside. She was very abrupt and said we have to wait. We ended up waiting another nearly 15 minutes because she didnt want to wait less than 30 seconds for him to walk through the door crowd. We would have gone somewhere else, but we had waited an hour plus already.   The waitress was very nice with her little pregnant belly. It was so cute. The food was very good and hot.

    "text": "I absolutely MUST give a SHOUT OUT to BUTTERS!  BACKGROUND  As many of you know, my real True love in life is PANCAKES.  I am always on the search for a good pancake house.   In fact, in my earliest days on Yelp, I specifically searched for good suggestions for pancakes which led me several establishments.  These establishments included: Butterfield's Pancake House, Iss' Magic Mixes, Original Breakfast House, Wildflower Bread Company, Crying Onion Cafe, Donna's Bakery Cafe, The Good Egg, Crepe Bar, Crackers & Co Cafe, Morning Squeeze, Snooze An AM Eatery, Market Cafe, True Food Kitchen, and T.C. Eggington's.  But let's talk about BUTTER'S PANCAKES & CAFE!!  BUTTER'S PANCAKES & CAFE  Butter's Pancakes & Cafe has two Scottsdale locations.  Butter's strives to set high goals and achieve them, to be the best breakfast and lunch cafe in Arizona, and the world.   With over 40 years of restaurant experience and numerous successful prior concepts, they know that it takes fresh, innovative food served consistently with unsurpassed quality by dedicated team members in a clean and warm environment.   Additionally, they approach the dining experience as an idea, a way of living and a way of eating, which results in a better experience for their guests.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I first tried Butter's in 2016, whilst looking for new places for pancakes, and have been several times since.   Every time I've been, the line is out the door, with an approximate 20-40 minute wait.  The restaurant isn't fancy, but it is cute and clean. The staff is personable and efficient. The crowd ranges from 20's to retirees, so everyone fits in.  Everything I've tried was DELICIOUS. I especially LOVE the BERRIES CREPE PANCAKES!! Absolutely TO DIE FOR YUMMY!!  The staff is usually young, hip, and quick. My experience with the staff is that they are personable, but more to the point of bringing your meal fast and efficiently, so don't expect to be coddled, just expect to eat a great breakfast.  The environment is always busy and bustling, kind of like a New York deli, so don't expect a quiet romantic brunch.  CONCLUSION  I tolerate the long waiting because I LOVE the pancakes here so much. And so will you!  I will definitely keep coming back!  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *Reservations NOT accepted. Be prepared to wait.",

The newer location is fantastic because it has reduced the wait times to be seated. On our latest visit I had the bacon, onion, and mushroom skillet with a side of the delicious pancakes. My wife selected the Denver omelette. Our food arrived promptly and one of the great things about Butters is the staff works as a team making sure your coffee cup or iced tea is always topped off. My skillet was scrumptious! The eggs are so incredibly fluffy, and the ingredients postively explode with flavor. The pancakes are sublime and have to be devoured to be truly appreciated. If you find yourself within a half an hour drive with a serious appetite for breakfast you know where to go--Butters!",

    "text": "This was my husband and my first visit to Butters Pancakes & Cafe in Scottsdale. As we approached the restaurant in our car, we noticed the line of hungry folks waiting for a table to become available.  My husband gave them our name and it was entered into an iPad they use to keep track of people waiting to be seated. The hostess logged my husband in on the iPad and sent him a link on Yelp; from there my husband could monitor our progress in line. It showed where we were in line and how many people were ahead of us--I think this is a neat and efficient way to use technology.  When it was our turn he saw it on Yelp and received a phone with a message. We were greeted by a friendly hostess whom led us to a booth. Once seated, we perused the menu of a wide variety of breakfast and lunch dishes.  I chose the vegetable egg skillet with wheat toast and my husband chose the corn beef hash and pancakes. We drank coffee and they bring out real cream for the coffee; there is ice cold water in a glass pitcher as well. They sell their signature coffee and pancake syrup at the front; they also have a coffee bar.  We didn't wait too long before our delicious food was brought to our table by our friendly waitress. Wow!! All I can say is wow! Our food was delicious! I had my eggs scrambled on my vegetable skillet with hash browns. My eggs were light and fluffy, the vegetables fresh and prepared just right. My husband's hash was crispy and his fried eggs perfect. His pancakes came with butter and powdered sugar on the side. Our breakfast was yummy! This location is very busy and nearby they are building a new and much larger restaurant they will move into within the next few months. We will definitely be back in the near future to try more of their delicious breakfast.",

We ordered and I asked for an omlette with onions, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, spinach and bacon.  It was the fluffiest omlette I have ever ever ever eaten!  Holy smokes!  The hash browns were definitely fresh, crispy and hot!  The pancakes were simply fantastic!  My 91 year old dad had pancakes, fried egg, fruit and bacon.  He ate everything but a piece of bacon.    Our server, Karissa, was funny, pleasant and efficient.  The bus girl worked her butt off and never stopped!  The only thing I saw that was off was the manager.  He never smiled or said a kind word to the staff.  I watched and I read lips pretty darn well and he never said a nice thing.  He seemed put off if he decided to step in and help serve coffee or start bussing a table and there never was a time the staff was slacking.  He just never seemed satisfied.  The place is small and BUSY BUSY BUSY but the food comes out quickly!  I will go again!",

My husband enjoyed the New Mexico skillet with chorizo, tomato, avocado, and cheese.

He is funny and great with kids. Kind of place we would repeatedly go back to if we lived closer.   The food: We ordered the Denver Omelette, grits, French toast for the kiddos, Mexican omelette and Pancakes (so yummy!). The omelettes were sooo fluffy and huge!!! The ham was extra tasty and the grits were so creamy! I'm from the South and those grits were the best tasting grits we've ever had. We scraped our plates! There was nothing left! Great food. Great conversation. We Will go back!",

Had this all 3 days if that tells you anything.  The coffee is the best we have had in Phoenix over several trips.  They use a local roaster that has been around since the early 70's.

We sat outside which was a really nice clean, quiet area. I ordered the regular pancakes- and they were amazing!

Some people.  Anyway, the wait was well worth it. The service was super friendly and fast. The food was delicious. I had a Mexican omelette that was perfectly cooked. Really, perfectly. My wife said their orange juice was super fresh and the best she has had in a long time. The kids had pancakes and waffles they devoured. If we ever visit the Scottsdale area we will definitely go there for breakfast again.",

The hostesses do a great job and always have it together. They're always courteous, and just like everyone else there they work hard. We sat inside as it was first available, which was more than fine. The inside was full, however it wasn't extremely loud like some places get. We always get our food right away and always without mistakes.  I got the Santa fe scrammle which is always good. The serving size says two eggs but it's a huge portion! I like Butter's giving you the choice of fruit, grits, or hash browns, while still giving you the  next choice of pancakes or toast. (when you get an omelette or scrambler) I also added zucchini and peppers to my dish and it was only a $0.25 up charge for each.   My bf got the two eggs, with fruit and bacon as a protein. he also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes. The pieces of bacon are a good size,eggs were scrambled perfectly, and he loves the pancakes every time.  The prices are very reasonable and the servers and bus staff are very attentive.   Thank you Butter's staff so much for letting me wake up and know I have a place for breakfast I can go that won't disappoint.",

I ordered pancakes with eggs and bacon and while my hot cakes and bacon was good my eggs were not, I sent them back and they were still wrong so I didn't even touch them.   My son ordered a waffle which he said was the best he's ever tasted which says a lot for this picky eater, he also ordered hashbrowns and was brought diced potatoes which he doesn't like so he picked over those. The place is very nice in a beautiful area and if I could give them a half start rating I would rate them as 3 1/2 based on my egg screw up but since I can't I'll give them a 3 and a promise to try them again.   The inside of the place was cold which made my pancakes get colder than normal room temp rates so I felt rushed to eat them but they were good so no complaints from me.",

I think that dish or the fruit cup were my least favorite things.   Btw it's only 1 dollar to make your side of pancakes into the flavored pancakes so you should definitely take advantage of that.

    "text": "I don't like breakfast places.  When I sit down at a table and someone asks me if I want coffee, I'm immediately disgusted.  If I wanted dirty bean water, I'd sip the mud-sludge out of a gutter on Via de Ventura.  I also don't crave eggs or grits or toast.  I am a man, and I am powered by steak, and burgers, and alcohol.  I also hate the atmosphere of breakfast places.  Sunny, and open, with weird art on the walls - no.  So that said, my co-worker talked me into going here, and it is awesome.  Yeah you go in and it's all sunny and there are a bunch of families there, and grandma and grandpa took little junior to get some waffles, and they try to serve you coffee as if you're a dirty hobo, but the food... hoooooly cow, man.  The food is delicious.  I'm talking about thick strips of bacon - as thick as a strip of beef jerky, and cooked to perfection: crispy, but not burnt.  I grabbed an Eggs Benedict with hash browns, and the entire plate figuratively slid down my throat.  Nothing was greasy or oily, but it had to be unhealthy as delicious as it was.  But it did not feel unhealthy! The orange juice was freshly squeezed (I had a seed in mine!  That's authentic!) and delicious.  The service was fast (for a breakfast place), and reasonably courteous.  I'll be back.",

Always clean with delish food and pleasant waitstaff. My only ding is that the acoustics in this place are horrible. Any background music and/or the amount of people in the place can make the atmosphere painfully noisy. When I go there, I try to go early on the weekends or late in the morning on the weekdays to avoid the crowds.",

The intake process was pretty quick, the hostess let me know how long it would be, took my name and then I got a text. They told me to wait would be 20 to 30 minutes, and it was probably about 20. I was seated quickly, and greeted by my server immediately. The service was good, not necessarily great, it felt like she was rushing me a little bit. Due to the fact that they are so busy, I can appreciate this, but she brought me my check after two bites into my meal. As far as the food, I had the banana French toast and a side of bacon. The French toast was awesome, and it came out very fast, probably 5 minutes after I ordered. Overall, a good experience, and I would come back. It is not the best breakfast I've ever had, so I will keep looking for another spot in Scottsdale to become my go to. Overall good food, decent service, and okay ambience.",

Not only have I not had anything bad on the menu, but they will make everything on their menu healthier. They will use egg white or Pam instead of butter upon request and they are really good about substituting potatoes or breads whereas a lot of other restraints are more difficult about these things or you don't know how something is being cooked. Aside from just being able to get a healthy breakfast, their scrambles are delicious! And if you are in the mood for a treat they have great pancakes and their bacon is probably the best I have had in the area. Also, the juices are fresh, the coffee is good and the coffee drinks are wonderful!   It is really hard to get a table at Butters over the weekend, so go at an off time if you can to try it!",

In fact, after dining there yesterday morning, I had to stop the restaurant manager to let him know how impressed I was with the entire Butters experience. I am from Toronto and was visiting Arizona this past weekend. Since breakfast is my favourite! meal of the day, I was searching for the perfect spot in Arizona, and thank goodness I found it! Let me break down what I love about Butters:  Food: Pancakes and orange juice, pancakes and orange juice, oh my goodness can I say that ten times. I cannot describe into words how amazing these two items are on the menu--and this is coming from a girl who loooooves pancakes and has been on the hunt for years for the best pancakes. Well, thanks to Butters I finally found it. They are light, fluffy, and literally mouth-watering. The orange juice comes out of this really cool machine and the taste is like nothing you've ever had! fresh, sweet, amazing!  Service: All of the staff was so attentive and professional. Not annoying or pretentious. The food was served quickly and came out hot and wonderful!  Atmosphere: The place is really chic, but warm and inviting. I went with my family, but Butters would also be the perfect date spot, or a spot to hang out with friends for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday.  Overall, I can't wait to go back to Butters on my next trip to Arizona!",

This place not only met, but exceeded all my expectations!  I read that the wait time to be seated can often be lengthy, but it only took 15 minutes to get seated. The waitress was extremely attentive and checked on us frequently during our meal to make sure everything was going great.   I ordered the Classic Benny with hash browns and it came within minutes! The service was sooooo fast. Better than almost any restaurant I've ever been too. The portion sizing for the Classic Benny was perfect. Big enough to get you full, but not a sickening amount.  My husband also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. It was about $4 for a small glass, but it was actually worth it!   If you're looking for a filling, fast, and delicious breakfast/brunch, I highly recommend Butters. Next time I go back I'm definitely going to try some of their decadent pancakes!!",

However, we felt really rushed by our waitress, it seemed that the only thing she cares about was getting her tips at the end of the meal. She gave us our check in the middle of eating our breakfast.. Seriously, wait a little bit! We didn't wait 45 minutes outside to eat in 10 minutes ! That is mainly the reason why I am giving 3 stars.",

Here's the critical tip: upgrade to the banana cream with gram cracker crumb topping for a mere $0.99. We ended up sharing it, although I did eat most of it. Amazing!",

My husband and I used our GPS to find this restaurant, easy to find, we pulled in, appreciating being able to make a right turn for a change.  Upon entrance, we were initially dismayed to see about 20 people lined up outside, after a half hour wait, we were seated at a booth.  The noise volume of conversations and pop-music require hearing impaired to use sign language to communicate.  It's a fast-paced place.  One of the owners present could not believe we came up from Tucson to eat here because we haven't found anything in Tucson that can compete with this restaurant.  The delicate Belgian waffle and FRESH strawberries and turkey bacon was a sure pleaser.  Modest in price, this place commands a return visit for more of the same, fresh ingredients, an eclectic menu and pancakes and waffles that don't taste like they are out of a Safeway mix box.",

First of all the atmosphere on the patio was our first hint that we'd like it here.  There is a fountain right off the back and the sounds and smells that make for a pleasant experience.  They were also playing fun music on the patio as well.  Nothing loud or obnoxious, but it was a welcomed addition on a Sunday morning.    Secondly, this is somewhat like a cafe.  They have a barista bar there and the latte my wife got was very tasty and my coffee was very excellent.    Our meals were very good as well.  When it comes to breakfast foods, you don't need to reinvent the wheel.  They served good food, and at a good price and great atmosphere.  We will definitely be back.  **Update** We went back again this Sunday and had another great experience.  The service was awesome and the food was even better.  I went out on a limb and tried something I usually wouldn't get, the Corned Beef Hash Skillet... topped with over easy eggs.  It was amazing.  It also was a lot of food.  I ate about half of it, but I am so glad I tried it.",

It is an average place.  nothing stood out except that they purposely use genetically modified ingredients, they never use anything organic on purpose. everything you eat in here is genetically modified per the manager who does not believe in organic food...the orange juice is fresh squeezed so what we fresh squeeze our own o.j. daily and tastes the same as here...do not use the pancake syrup on the table it is not made by butters, per the waitress and the manager is it store bought with high fructose corn syrup and a little bit of maple then transferred into their own bottles...I did not like the fact if you want regular 100% maple syrup they will charge you $1.00 for it...which is unheard of...according to Chris the manager, if we gave away the really expensive healthy maple syrup they we would have to raise the prices...which is basically incorrect...I have never been in a restaurants which charge for pure maple syrup and the prices of other places are less expensive than butter's...The manager Chris needs help, his opinions about GMO being healthy and good for you are ignorant.. as well as him thinking they are too good to offer customers coupons...  We will not be back to this place, the food was just okay nothing fancy and certainly not healthy with all genetically modified ingredients..avoid",

I'll have to try a few more dishes before giving it 5 stars, but the prices were incredibly reasonable for Scottsdale, the service was prompt, and I agonized for a while over what to eat because everything looked so appealing.  The restaurant has an updated diner feel, and I wish they had one closer to us in central Phoenix, because the prices at OverEasy and Taylor Cafe are prohibitive. Seriously, if this place was located closer, we'd be there every weekend.  I was really satisfied with my skillet. I wouldn't say it was amazing or anything, but breakfast food is tough to innovate, and I'm fine with it that way.  Also, it's kind of fun thinking about the South Park character, like when he became a pimp that one time.",

Mind you this order was $40+. We were waiting for our coffee and smoothie. My husband simply asked the lady at the counter if they had a simple syrup they would throw in the coffee for him and she continues to point to the chocolate syrup. He was Trying to explain what simple syrup was and she as was still confused. The manager instantly storms out in a hostile manner without even being prompted by your confused staff and raises his voice in front of 15 + customers(families, children, elders) as my husband is Trying to explain the situation. He REFUSED to even listen and literally pushed my husband out of the door raising his first at my husband as well as making physical threats, including \"oh I would do something you wouldn't come back from\" My husband was even holding open the door for two woman entering who thanked my husband for holding to the door right in front of the manager. I even asked the girl if I had called her an idiot and because the manager was literally screaming, she looked completely terrified to even answer.   I have worked many years into the restaurant industry in management and I have NEVER seen a manager treat a customer in this matter.   Especially to do this on a Sunday the busiest time of day. I am a regular weekend patron that  attended with family and business associates. Before I called into the establishment I was meeting with associates of mine.   To be completely HUMILIATED, DISRESPECTED, and EMBARRASSED in front of such a wonderful establishment is just beyond my words .....   The manager also refused to give us his name or any other employee involved. This is the shittiest customer service. They lost a regularly customer because of a power hungry manger that wants to humiliate PAYING customers. Not one time does he give the common curtesy to listen to the other end of the sorry.    Absolute pathetic. He should be reprimanded for his actions or clearly retrained on how to deal with issues that arise that may have been mis understood or some general professionalism that he seems to be purely lacking . Just so disappointing that a place held to such high standard condones poor management.  We will NEVER Be returning.",

However, if you eat eggs, there are better breakfast places in the Valley to go for breakfast. Trust me.   The last few times we visited Butters, I've made the mistake of ordering scrambled eggs. They literally looked like a scoop of wet, yellow poo. And I'm being nice here.  These so-called \"scrambled eggs\" didn't look like real eggs at all, and because of the \"texture\"  and \"wetness\" of them, I can't imagine what in the world I was eating (or trying to eat). I had them with one of their skillet breakfasts which had onions, bacon, mushrooms and potatoes, topped with this glop of yellow, wet \"stuff\".   After vomiting violently for over two hours, I've vowed never to return to try anything else at Butters, because seriously, there's way better places for breakfast that actually use eggs that have a yolk and egg white that is visible.   The only reason I\"m giving this place 2 stars is because, like I said, people say the pancakes are good, and I'll have to take their word for it.   Sorry, Butters, but Matt's Big Breakfast, The Original Pancake House, Snooze, Scramble and a host of other breakfast hot spots have you beat. By far...",

    "text": "Great place with super-fast & friendly service & plenty of great options (including gluten free).   We headed here on a Saturday morning for breakfast and as all the other reviews note, it was packed, and there were several people waiting for a table, especially since everyone was requesting indoor seating due to the chilly morning. Don't be turned off by this. Despite the wait we were seated in less than 10 minutes (what we were quoted) and after we ordered our food, it was out in less than 10 minutes.  Gluten free eaters, you are in luck. Choose from a variety of skillets, omelets, and egg scrambles as well as gluten free pancakes or gluten free Belgian waffles! I ordered the New Mexico skillet and chose the gluten free pancakes and a cup of fruit as sides. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no up-charge for the two GF pancakes as other places usually tack on at least $2 extra! Pancakes were really good - not super dry & crumbly as most GF pancakes tend to be and the skillet was spicy and tasty.   This is also a great breakfast option for those that have no dietary restrictions as they can also choose from some unique french toast options, french crepes, breakfast burritos and plenty of oatmeal options.  Service was on point - the minute our plates were done, they were picked up, our waters and coffee were filled like clock-work and this was all done without making us feel rushed at all.   Also, unlike a lot of other places in Scottsdale, this place was unpretentious, plenty of older people, kids, and college students clearly hung over in their pjs - no need to primp for this place. Would definitely stop by here again & try to eat out in the patio!",

Its location is a suburban Scottsdale shopping center. As you walk in you pass there fresh orange juice machine, you know the OJ has to be good and it was!  We were seated outside on this hot 95 degree Scottsdale morning (in April, wow) and the cool misters were blowing to keep the heat down.    The menu is quite large and I went with an interesting dish in their skillet section called Corned Beef Has Skillet.  Now, this is not your basic skillet dish.  This is a huge meal consisting of a base of has browns (well done for me) with delicious corned beef hash on top of it, then melted cheese (I think cheddar) and topped off with two eggs (poached just right for me).  Oh, did I mention on top of all of this, you get a side of pancakes or toast.  A whole lot of delicious food in that large skillet.  needless to say, I needed a good nap afterward!  We also tried the Cajun chicken sausage which was very good.  We did venture back the next day and I had a basic egg white omelet with spinach and feta.  Was not as impressed day 2 however I'm still thinking about that amazing skillet the day before so its 4 stars for Butters!",

When we got there they said 15 min wait bu we were seated in less than 5 mins and our waiter (Antonio) was fantastic.  Got our food to us quickly, refilled water and ice tea without being asked and made some really good suggestions on the menu. We will definitely be going back and we live 20 minutes away!

I believe food can taste wonderful if the server is welcoming and kind, I also believe that no matter how good the food is it can taste like garbage if the server is lack luster.  She wasn't a heinous b**** but she was definitely flirting with my boyfriend and being exceptionally attentive to him and not to me. Never met her in my life so I don't know why I was a witness to such pitiful child like behavior, getting dirty looks and all. I gave her the benefit of the doubt that hey maybe she just lost someone or is suffering idk. She served him first and his food came out piping hot while mine was late and luke warm. When I asked for hot sauce she went inside and disappeared for five minutes then came out and asked another table how they were doing and my boyfriend asked her for hot sauce and within a nano second she grabbed it right behind us and gave it to us.   I definitely do not recommend this place for females accompanied by males because this misogynistic behavior will most likely take place. We're not in the Middle East...we're in America this kind of ridiculous belittlement of women should be stopped.   Tips: check out OVER EASY for a cute and cozy atmosphere and comforting dishes including their signature caramelized banana french toast.",

You will literally get your order in less than 10 minutes from ordering. So basically you're in and out within 30 min!!

    "text": "Dang. It's always disappointing to be let down by a meal, but even more so when your experience pretty clearly goes against the Yelpy grain of goodness. It was beautiful pictures of corned beef hash that brought me into highly acclaimed Butters, but it was the corned beef hash that let me down.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  If there's one place where Butters doesn't disappoint, it's with their service and atmosphere. While the lines can really stack up, especially in the winter, the flow is efficient, and the servers on top of tables even on a crowded day. No complaints. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  While I didn't take a picture, my corned beef hash skillet was sizable, and partially thanks to the wheat toast, I was good and full by the end of it. At $9.45, it was reasonable for corned beef, which usually warrants a premium. Having said that, you might shortly learn why it was as cheap as it was. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Gah. It was here that things more or less fell apart, and we'll go top down in our analysis here. The eggs? Fine. There wasn't any uniqueness here, but there didn't necessarily need to be - they were eggs. The corned beef was the biggest letdown, as it was pretty clear that the corned beef hash used was straight out of the can. I could be wrong, but if I am, it was very, very bad freshly made corned beef hash. Bland flavor, standardized, factory consistency, and all in all not a great experience. I'd hoped that maybe the potatoes would save the skillet, but they weren't as crispy as I'd hoped. All in all, this was essentially just a sum of mediocre parts as opposed to the flavorful skillet that it could have been. No Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Scottsdale is stacked on great breakfast options, and while I could have shown up on an off day or ordered the wrong dish, my visit to Butters pancakes didn't 'stack' up. No Star Granted.",

The cappuccino frost is a delicious blended coffee drink. Butters has a real espresso machine, and the man preparing the coffee prepared it with delight. I mean, I could taste the joy in this coffee. SO GOOD.   The eggs were cooked to perfection; super flavorful and extraordinarily fluffy. The sausage was delicious, as were their pancakes. The hash browns aren't the traditional hash browns one is accustomed to; they're more like scalloped potatoes. BUT they are delicious nonetheless.

    "text": "Butters is by far the best breakfast joint in the state. Period! You simply won't find better pancakes elsewhere and can always expect great service! At this location, you can enjoy your breakfast on their lovely patio... This is one of my favorite patios in town! Whether it be breakfast, brunch or lunch, this place has great options for everyone. Very reasonable prices, fresh food, and FAST service. When I went last week we got our food within 10-15 minutes - now that's service. I will always recommend Butters to any local or those visiting the area!",

My only complaint was the restaurant wasn't very busy as I went in early before the church rush came. I sat with my bible and was doing some studying throughout my meal, and was rushed the entire time. I get that turning tables effectively is a way for the waitress to make more money but I didn't even have time to breathe. I didn't feel I was being inconsiderate with my studying considering it was dead and way early in the morning. I was in and out in less than 35 minutes and felt unwanted. Great coffee and food but the waitresses don't have a great way to hide their obvious agendas.",

    "text": "Ok the basic pancake was good.   Would not say the best, but good.   Service was good, coffee was good.   But i ordered pecan pancakes.  I expected pecans to be in the batter, not chopped on top of the pancake.   I am glad i did not order the blueberry pancakes as the last one i had was in upstate new york.  the bottom of each pancake was all blueberries with blueberries cooked into the pancake.  At $8.75 i expected a bit larger then 4 6inch pancakes.   And finally.  How can you be upper end and not serve real maple syrup.  Ok charge me an extra buck, I am already up to $12 for a pancake breakfast and coffee.  Don't mind paying for it, but i do expect to leave thinking i can't wait to go back.    Easily the most overpriced pancake breakfast i have ever had.  I spoke with my wife who had managed kitchens and yes Pecans should go in the batter.   I was able to also see the menue after writing this .. The description was 'stuffed'  .. so what i got was not what i should have gotten.  I was served 4 buttermilk pancakes (same size as the one my son got as a substitute for toast).   His were chocolate chip and the pancakes were not stuffed.  He immediately rubbed it in and said .. Dad for 2 bucks more you could have gotten an Eggs skillit and 2 pancakes.  My guess is that they screwed up and the waitress grabbed buttermilk pancakes throwing the topping on them.   2nd screw up i assume was that i got pancakes that would have been provided as a sub for toast.",

    "text": "My daughter came home for the weekend and we all wanted to go out for brunch. So what do you do? Of course, check out your Yelp bookmarks. I've had Butters bookmarked for awhile. So we decided to try.   We got there and had to wait for a good 15 minutes. Their indoor waiting area is really small but they do have an outdoor waiting area too. They give you one of those remote buzzers so that cool. Anyways, we got seated and got a booth by the window. It's a pretty big dining area that looks fairly modern for a breakfast joint. Nice and clean.   Our server greeted us right away and took our drink orders. Surprisingly, our drinks came fairly quickly.   I ordered the Whole Hog Skillet and an upgrade to one of their signature cakes. Got the Wildberry Bliss cakes. The Skillet came with hash brown potatoes, bacon, ham, & sausage with two scrambled eggs and jack & cheddar cheese. Oh my goodness, loved it. The hash browns were great. Loved how the potatoes are sliced thin and browned just enough to give it that crispness. It was really good. Enjoyed it a lot. I'm so glad I upgraded to the signature cakes. The Wildberry Bliss was so good. They give you two cakes and it has fresh berries with vanilla cream. Wasn't too sweet but really good. Didn't even need syrup. The fresh berries just topped it off. Really good  My daughter got the Eggs Verde that had corn tortillas on the bottom with black beans, eggs, jack cheese with green chile sauce smothering it. Came with their hash browns too. I snuck a bite and it was so good. My daughter loved it too. The green chile sauce had enough kick to it. This whole dish just somehow came together. Really good dish.  Then my wife ordered the eggs with chicken sausage and hash browns. She loved it. Said the eggs were so fluffy and she loved the chicken sausage. She was raving about her breakfast. She even said that this was probably one of the best breakfast she's had. That's pretty big compliment from her.   Anyways, service was excellent. Quick and efficient. Our server check on us and didn't have to fill our water cups cause they have a water jar so you can fill yourself. Really like that. She was busy but always kept track of us.   So we had a great breakfast here. Great food, great service. Nice atmosphere. Everyone at the other tables seem to enjoy themselves.  Do yourself a favor and try this place. I will be back and I have no problem ordering the same thing or something else. It's all good. Enjoy",

    "text": "Butters was fairly good. Not anything too amazing though. I'll start with the good. Our server, Ally, was very sweet and pleasant! The barista beverages were super good, my friend and I both got the iced white chocolate mocha! Their pancakes are so good, I got the banana cream ones, which were only a $1.50 up-charge from toast. My friend got the wild berry pancakes which were also very delicious. Two of us got the popeye scramble which was okay, nothing special, and 2 others got the Hog skillet. The food took less than 10 minutes! So awesome.  Now to the things I wasn't crazy about. The \"over medium\" eggs on one of the skillets was NOT over medium, pretty much over hard without the yolk broken, basically solid. Both the scrambles had barely any bacon, and something I thought was strange was that they scrambled the avocado INTO my scramble... totally an opinion but I wasn't crazy about that. Everyone agreed that all our egg dishes were just okay, nothing special. The best parts of our meal were our drinks and our pancakes. Speaking of the pancakes, although the up-charge is small, and they were delicious, the pancakes were tiny!!! Probably only about 3 inches across. And lastly, I really dislike how much paper/ plastic they waste here. All their barista drinks are served in to go cups... which isn't good for the environment. And the butter for the pancakes comes in a paper cup as well.  So yeah, not amazing. If you come, I would stick to pancakes. Fairly good food though!",

Luckily, it was a nice day and we were able to run some quick errands while we waited. I really liked how they took down your phone number and sent you a text (and called) when your table was ready instead of giving you a buzzer.  The server seemed a bit overwhelmed by all of us, and forgot a few things here and there (milk for the hot tea, a set of utensils, napkins), but she was pleasant enough. The food came out quickly and was hot and fresh. The coffee was great and she came by often to refill it.  As I mentioned, I LOVED the banana bread French toast. Literally banana bread dipped in batter, then topped with pecans and bananas. Delicious!! The eggs were fluffy but nothing remarkable. I sampled the cheese grits and they were super cheesy! I also sampled the Oreo pancakes- way too much going on there for me. Too sweet, too many toppings.  Price point was fair and I enjoyed my experience. Especially that French toast!",

    "text": "Came here with a large group a while back and let me tell you. It was a Sunday and they weren't very inviting to our group in the beginning until we all arrived on point. I was trying to be seated slightly early because I had a broken foot and it's triple digit heat. I was able to get a chair outside to sit in at least after asking. My experience with the renowned manager was extremely negative to the point I told the other person I seriously didn't want to talk to him anymore nor deal with him. I didn't really care he was known. Blah blah blah. How he treated me was what I experienced was very poor. The food was good but seriously they need to rethink how they treat  groups. Don't remind me it's Sunday! I know it is. We all wanted a Sunday brunch! Duh! Our group was of respectful caliber and wished we were treated as such. Global travelers are generally going to be more reliable and set a higher standard for an establishment especially if we are bringing in a large party. Please don't judge every group on a few bad experiences and declare to us we are going to be bad and not have our group show up because you have had bad experiences in the past. That is like me saying I'm going to have a bad dining experience because I had one at a different restaurant. Not ok. It was clear they wanted us in and out in an hour which was slightly rude especially when the checks came so quickly and wanted it squared away. Food was good but not worth the headache of the staff and reminders of it's a busy Sunday. We know and it was the only time we could all get together. Ugh! Frustrating place. Poor customer service.",

    "text": "I'm so bummed this isn't a good review because I had high expectations for this place. I've been following them on Instagram for a while and it's been \"must try list\".   First. There was a 30 min wait. Which is totally doable considering it's a Saturday morning. They informed us they would send us a text when our table was ready. 30 mins later no text. We went in to get an update and they said they called our name on the intercom. We were outside because it was crowded inside. We didn't hear anything. And there was no text. The front desk person kept making eye contact with us. That wasn't the best first impression. But we were willing to let that slide.   Second. Upon being seated we wait literally 15 mins u til someone even asked for drinks. The server walked by multiple times and not even an acknowledgement of our existence occurred. What did it for me was when a couple was seated next to us, and they received instant service. Even after that, we were still ignored. Finally the server got to us, but only to ask for coffee. I would have been fine if she apologized for the lack of service due to rush hour, but not even that happened.   Most likely won't be coming back because due to lack of service. It's unfortunate because I really liked that Instagram page :(",

My waitress walked by me 3 times before I guess she either saw me or realized I was her table. I mean after seeing me the second time she could have asked.... have you been helped? The food is still good... but when you feel like you're not being attended to or the servers demeanor is one of..... hey I just take orders and deliver food.  I mean this goes for the front of  the house also. I walked in and they like stared at me for about 6-9 seconds. I'm like.... helloooooo. Maybe it's the increased noise level.... got them all unable to focus. Industrial noise and hiring people unable to work with it. Plates, people, clanging, etc....  they definitely seem to be zombies. idk.  While I used to look for reasons to go to Butters.... now it's just on my mediocre list. What used to be a great place to enjoy with outside seating, the water fountain outside, busy exciting place..... now.... it's like a STEPFORD Butters....... PLASTIC. Just sayin",

Started the morning with a good ole fashion coffee. Feeling adventurous I had the New Mexico skillet. The potatoes harsh had chorizo and tomatoes. It was topped with the fluffiest eggs I have ever had and avocado. This dish was light but hearty at the same time.  The whole hog skillet had bacon, sausage and had in the harsh and topped with their fluffy eggs.  This dish was surprisingly not salty considering it had bacon, sausage and ham in it. This was a great dish.   The blue berry pancakes were dessert for breakfast.  Each cake was filled with a lot of blueberries and between each was a whipped mascarpone cream.  Heavenly!

Great lighting, outdoor patio eating area looks nice too especially when the weather is a lot warmer.  Upon arrival there was about 5-10min wait which I was told be a host after she had a moment to look up from her cell phone. I told her it would just be me eating and they offered me a seat right in the front of the house, I declined and asked for a booth and she told me I would have to wait again, which was no problem. Lucky a booth became ready right away and another host quickly sat me in a more comfortable location.  The service from Alexandra was beyond awesome! She was very professional and attentive even helped me with the menu and explained everything perfectly. She checked on me several times and even made sure my food came out perfect! I even noticed how she entertained they table next to me and I must say her customer service skills are very impressive.  I ordered the \"whole hog skillet\" not a bad option at all very good! But for pancakes to be a staple her I just expected them to taste a lot better. Not saying they weren't good but far from great. Next time I'll order French toast lol.  Will comeback, hopefully I can get lucky with the seating and service again BC this places looks like it can get very busy.  PS I paid $5.28 for orange juice, YIKES! I understand the have a juice bar/cafe in the front and it's prolly super all natural but my whole meal was only $11.",

    "text": "We took my daughter & grandson (10mos) for an early Sunday morning breakfast. It was the first nice morning, weather wise, and would have been a wonderful morning to have breakfast outside. I have fond memories of this restaurant & dining outside when it was \"The Good Egg\". When we arrived we found out that we could not sit outside in the beautiful morning air because they didn't have enough servers. It would have been simple & easy to sit us outside and have one of the servers walk thru the doors to serve us. The way the restaurant is set up its just a couple of extra steps to the outside. Very short sighted thinking.  The manager was not very welcoming, never smiling or indicating that we were welcome guests as should happen in a restaurant setting. When ordering we requested something simple, like adding cottage cheese to scrambled eggs, in order to make it softer for the baby to eat. We were told that the \"boss\" didn't like to make changes to the menu but she would ask. They did end up doing it but when they brought it out, it was unbelievable, it looked like they'd added a whole pint of cottage cheese to one egg. They redid it and it was just okay. With all of the competition in Scottsdale you would think that they would do all they could to make a customer happy.  I probably will think twice about bringing my business back to this restaurant. This restaurant needs to work on their customer service & their attitudes. Their food is good, except for the pancakes, which are dry and fall apart when you cut into them.  Altogether a disappointing experience.",

Surprisingly enough we also LOVE the New Mexico skillet. It has green hatch chili's (real ones in AZ) very rare.  It's the right amount of heat/ spice.  No matter what I order a fresh orange juice & a simple, done right cup of coffee. The portions are quite large, so come hungry! Or even shareable (if you are willing too).

It's usually fairly busy but they just moved into a new building which is much nicer and so it's not as loud which I like but I have to tell you if you want pancakes and your in Scottsdale this is where you need to go. Or of course if your French toast addict like I am this is also the place to go. So you gotta check this place out. I really do recommend it. the service is really good. the food is really good. definitely a can't miss.",

The Santa Fe Scrambler, laced with Chorizo and jalapeno, proved to be a filling and properly kicked up breakfast... no hot sauce required. The Banana Nut Bread Toast was highly recommended by our food guides (cousins). Being banana bread lovers, we had to share an order; also very good. I don't know where they get their bacon, but it was exceptional. I'm sure whoever orders their ingredients is a pig whisperer. A very good breakfast.. recommend.",

I ordered the classic French toast with sausage and hash browns. My gf ordered the waffles with grits.  The French toast was fluffy and definitely melt in your mouth. I prefer crispier French toast, but these were still great. Now, I was not prepared for the side of sausages to contain 3 patties. Lol great surprise but with everything I ordered I couldn't finish everything. But they definitely give you what you pay for.   My gf said the waffles were delicious better then expected. The grits for her were different then what she's use too a lot more creamy. She liked them with sugar and butter. I had a taste and they were good.   The service was great  I don't remember her name but she has two braids on the day we went lol. Which was yesterday.   Oh! Almost forgot we has the smoothie and omg they are delicious! Definitely try either of them they were all great.   On my list to definitely come back to our next trip to Arizona!",

We started with some coffee because why not. I ordered a sugar free vanilla latte!! Whoa! So good! I also tried my friends chai latte.. also yummy!  I ordered the Popeye scramble and it was yummy.. maybe a bit more onions than I like but I finished everything. I upgraded my cakes to the cinnamon roll one and soooooo goooood!

I had the eggs verde plate under their specialties menu which includes corn tortillas, black beans, cheese, 2 eggs, green chili sauce and hash browns. It was so tasty and perfect for what I want out of breakfast- not too sweet, not spicy and just the right mix of savory ingredients. Writing this makes me want it again BUT I'm determined to try their pancakes.  Waiting for my food I could see other tables orders and from what I could tell, anything is worth trying. The omelets looked massive, skillets looks fresh and amazing and then there was the pancakes... wow. I have to have these so that means I have to go back. Oh and the service?? Amazingly kind AND super fast, thank you!!!  It's a breakfast/brunch only but and early start to the day is worth it for this food. I took one of their cappuccino blast drinks (mocha flavored) to go and it made me so happy. I am excited that I found this place and it's a great recommendation.",

Butters has a wide variety of breakfast foods but what they are know for are there pancakes.  You really cannot go wrong with any of their pancakes but I would recommend the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes.  The pancakes are exactly that.  Just imagine a cinnamon roll in pancake form.  No need for syrup on this one.  The next pancake you should go after would be the Protein Power Pancakes which are wheat pancakes, blueberries, oats & almonds.  You get the light fluffy pancake mixed with the crunch of the oats and the almonds then the sweetness of the blueberries.  These will fill you up!  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  The food here is well worth the wait, and trust me you will have to wait.  If you have to wait you know there is good food (great indicator of good food just sucks waiting).  So, go get buttered up!

They conveniently text you once it's your turn in line.  We ordered a hog skillet and upgraded the pancakes for $1.50 to wild berry bliss pancakes. I ordered a classic eggs benedict and shared. The hog skillet had bacon and potatoes and eggs. The food was plain and it tasted like something you could make at home but it wasn't too greasy.  My wild berry bliss pancakes  looked picture perfect the  pancake itself was lacking. The marscapone cheese was a nice touch I did enjoy the fresh berries. The egg benedict was unmemorable and usually it is my favorite. I didn't care for the hashbrown which were sliced and fried like scalloped potatoes.   Verdict: This was a drive for us the patio seating was nice but there's better breakfast places out there.",

Since I have not tried other items on their menu I can only give them a four star rating. Let it be known that this is based on their pancakes.",

I believe that oil it is pretty standard everywhere in this area. The only reason I didn't give them five star is because the bacon was soggy and dry and the eggs were boring flavorless. Pancakes are great though.",

I don't know many other brunch places that can make ordinary skillets found everywhere into something extraordinary, and this place does it.  We got the California scramble with a side of chocolate chip pancakes and the New Mexico skillet with a side of regular pancakes topped with fresh strawberries.   The California scramble was a lighter take on a normal omelette, filled with grilled chicken, avocado, etc. It was fluffy and the chicken was moist! The New Mexico skillet was hefty, so do not get it if you're looking for something lighter. They gave a generous amount of chorizo and avocado. Both portions were good.   The pancakes were yummy! Their house made maple syrup was light but still flavorful compared to other places that taste thick and molasses-like.   The wait seems to go by pretty quickly, so don't get intimidated. It's big on the inside and can accommodate many customers at once for dine in. Highly recommend!",

I ordered a skillet that was pretty good, and my fiance ordered a scramble that was even better than my dish. We both got sides of pancakes which were really great. The syrup was genetic fake stuff which was disappointing, but the pancakes fluffiness made up for it. Coffee was constantly filled, and we left satisfied from the food...  However... The two hostesses we dealt with were clueless and rude. The one girl looked like a middle school student and quoted our wait at 25-30 minutes. We waited for 75 minutes to get a table. Missing a wait time by 15 minutes is acceptable, but missing by almost a hour is ridiculous. As for the other hostess we received a complementary order of smug. Apparently this girl had a large case of disinterested before coming into work, and was one of the least friendly and helpful hostesses I have ever dealt with. Despite good food and great service once I sat down, I would be hesitant to return based on my wait, rude hostess, and side of smug with my breakfast.",

We arrived around 10 am and had to check in with the hostess, were given a light up vibrating table ready device.    The predicted 20 minute wait was accurate.    1 star for nice food, but not the great to die for pancakes we had heard about 1 star for nice service, no pressure to rush, well managed. 1 star for meeting our breakfast needs with a nice ample breakfast menu.  But I have to say my guest said it well - \" this is not much different than The Good Egg or any other breakfast chain.\"  I think he was right.  Next time we will stay downtown and head over to Matt's big breakfast.  PS:  the place is huge for a breakfast joint - indoor and outdoor patios.  Expect lines on a Saturday.",

The kicker on this one is when we arrived to put our name in the hostess (who I am pretty sure is 12) was clearly flustered and irritated, looked at us expectantly and said \"yes?\" Not hello, how are you, welcome, how many? But \"yes?\" Strike one. We were told 20-30 minutes.... We have been waiting for 30 and were just told it would be another 20..... Hmmm.... Maybe you should learn to round those numbers up dear. Another young lady has now joined the infantile hostess with an ever worse attitude. We were clearly bothering her by asking how much longer our wait would be. Again, no smile, no welcome, didn't even offer us a glass of water on this steamy Arizona morning. Hopefully we will be seated soon and hopefully all of the food reviews are not a lie and my morning will be saved.",

When we were seated we waited about 10 minutes just to have our waitress come to our table, and when she got there she didn't even smile. She just said \"what do you want to drink.\" I mean, at least fake that you like your job when you have a customer-facing role.  The prices are good, but then again, nobody's going broke at Denny's, either. What I will give them the three stars for is the fact that no one in our party ordered the place's namesake. Pancakes are their thing. They had a ton of variety on the menu, and if I ever went back (not likely) I would definitely go for the pancakes. The extra star is basically just my way of giving them the benefit of the doubt. I'm so sad I didn't like this place more. Oh well.",

    "text": "Honestly, I'm not sure why this place has so many good reviews. I went here Sunday morning with my girlfriend. We have been anticipating the opening of Butters because it is right across the street from us and going out for a late breakfast always makes for a good time on a lazy Sunday morning. We went around 10am and there was a 20 minute wait.  Not a big deal because I expected it.   We finally got called inside to get seated and getting to our table was like trying to find a seat on a crowded subway in Boston. This place was JAM PACKED with tables. Every seat in the place looked uncomfortable just due to the fact that the table next to you, was basically breathing down your neck.   We got sat in a booth (thank god) and took a look at the menu. We were asked, within a minute of sitting down, if we were ready to order. We said we needed some time to look, but she literally came back in less than 2 minutes to ask if we were ready again. It gave us the feeling that this place was just trying to get people in and out as fast as they could. My g/f asked what the creme anglaise was that came on the french toast. The waitress looked confused and said \"Um, I'm not sure but its like a sweet sauce\". Really?! At least offer to go find out. We rushed to decide and I ordered a veggie omelette with hash browns and pancakes and the g/f ordered the pumpkin french toast with the \"sweet sauce\" on the side.   The food came out fast but was nothing special. I took a few bites of the omelette and it was probably 90% cheese. I didn't even see a mushroom or zucchini in the few bites I took and the eggs didn't taste fresh. I pushed it aside and tried the pancakes. Maple syrup was definitely not real and the pancakes were dry and chewy. Hash browns are just hash browns. I didn't try the pumpkin french toast so I won't review it but she said it was just ok. About halfway through my omelette, the waitress puts the check on our table and says to have a great day like she was done with us. I hate when places do this.   I've literally had better breakfast and service at Denny's. I won't be returning.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and the food is good - I had the skillet breakfast both times and my husband had the chocolate chip pancakes, which are also good.  The reason why I'm giving it only 3 stars is because they seem to really \"nickle and dime\" you....it's right in the heart of Scottsdale, so I suppose they think they can do this to people.  The prices are already a bit high for breakfast...breakfast food is pretty inexpensive to make, but most meals on average are around $8 or $9 a plate.  If you want egg whites, it's like a $1.25 - who charges extra for egg whites?!  If you order a side of buttermilk pancakes and want a few chocolate chips thrown in - that will be $2.00 extra - I can almost buy an entire bag of chocolate chips at the grocery store fo $2.00.  My neice wanted whip cream on her Mickey Mouse Pancakes and I think that was $1.00 or so extra....see what I mean about \"nickeling and diming\"? - not too smart in this economy.    Like I said, the food is good, but seems very pricey.  I honestly don't see this place staying in business....especially as long as the previous tenant Le Peep stayed in business in that location.",

    "text": "I have been to Butters on numerous occasions - the latest being with three senior golfing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course.   We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isn't as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it.  The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didn't surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast.  It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isn't as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line.  The only thing keeping it from more stars, are the hash browns.  They are obviously prepackaged (or at least taste that way) - and a real breakfast place should have signature hash browns.  But all in all, a nice addition to the area.",

Tasted like the burnt Starbucks coffee.  He ordered the Fish and Chips. Homemade tartar sauce was a little on the sweet side, fish was ok and the french fries were not seasoned. We have had better.  I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip with a side of fruit. The bread was ok, the prime rib has a pretty good flavor. The dip was bland, almost like broth out of can. Side of fruit was really small.  I think they did a great job hiring someone to write up their menu and design the interior. But the food could use some fine tuning. For the price, I was expecting a little more flavor overall.  Probably will not go back again.",

    "text": "\"Will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road?\"  Oh wait, wrong Butters (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  That said, young Mr Stotch would likely be pretty happy about this Scottsdale restaurant that carries his namesake.  Opened in 2009 (and now with a second location in north Scottsdale), Butters is a popular and mostly traditional breakfast and lunch spot that I had my eye on for awhile.  Knowing that the crowds here are huge on the weekends, I decided to make a go of breakfast here right at opening bell on a Saturday.  Located on the northwest corner of Hayden & Via de Ventura, Butters' flagship location occupies a crowded strip center alongside other restaurants such as Grassroots, Zipps, Twisted Grove, and Tandoori Times.  There's seating for at least 100 here, but even at opening bell, the place filled up super quickly.  I was able to grab a table near the front before the queue started forming shortly after 7:30am.  The aesthetics of the restaurant are pleasant but nothing special.  Booths for some, tables for others, fairly basic decor on the walls.  Even the patio setup outside is fairly modest.  Looking over the reviews, their website, and the menu itself, it was hard to find any one dish that stood out as a crowd favorite (pretty much all of them had universal praise).  So I hedged my bets on a couple of items.  One item prominently mentioned on Butters' website was their Eggs Verde.  A corn tortilla topped with black beans, two eggs of your style choice, jack cheese, and green chiles.  Also comes with a side of either potatoes or grits (potatoes for me).  Since this is Butters \"Pancakes\" I of course needed to add some flapjacks to the repertoire.  I love cinnamon rolls so a side order of Cinnamon Roll Pancakes it was.  And a glass of their fresh squeezed orange juice to wash it all down.  Total cost for the food and drink plus tax and tip came to about $25.  I will concur with the masses that the OJ is indeed fresh and delicious, so yes by all means grab yourself a glass of this for breakfast next time you're here.  How about the pancakes?  Let's just say I didn't leave a trace of that sugary icing on the plate.  Two pancakes with a cinnamon swirl and a VERY liberal amount of sugary icing on top and on the sides.  My only regret with this dish is that I should've asked for a full order of three instead of the side order of two.  Lordy, was this delish.  Let's talk about the Eggs Verde.  I liked the potatoes and the main dish was a very healthy portion.  But honestly, the flavors were a little flat.  Part of that was probably my fault as I should've spent the extra $2 for the addition of chorizo sausage, which definitely would've helped.  But also I just didn't pick up much flavor from the chiles or the cheese.  The dish itself is priced well for the amount of food you get, but without the chorizo it just didn't do anything for me.  All in all, I can see why Butters is a popular Scottsdale go to for breakfast.  With items like pancakes, crepes, skillets, omelettes, french toast and waffles, and lots of healthy options as well, Butters has something for everyone.  Get there early to avoid the lines if you can, and whatever you do, don't skip the pancakes.  \"Do you know what I am saying?\"  Sorry, wrong Butters again.",

We were in staying in scottsdale for baseball spring training, and went to this breakfast place before a game. We came in without a reservation and did have to wait a good 30 minutes but it was extremely busy and super close to Salt River at Talking Stick Stadium so it was totally understandable.  We ordered the banana creme pancakes, a crepe i don't remember which one, and bacon and hash browns on the side. Everything we had was phenomenal, despite their super busy status it all came out in a timely manner. The server was extremely nice and checked up on us multiple times to make sure we were satisfied.  Price wise the items on the menu seemed very fair and I can understand why this location has consistently great reviews. I would recommend this to anyone in town for baseball or otherwise!",

We were sat quickly, the service was attentive without being over bearing and everyone was polite and pleasant.  The only issue we had was finding this place. I had never been here before and all the building around are pretty uniform. The signage definitely doesn't stand out so make sure you are paying attention when you are looking for it.

I had the classic waffles with fresh strawberries and my husband had the whole hog skillet with buttermilk pancakes. Their orange and grapefruit juice is fresh hand squeezed and delicious! The waffles were perfect, the eggs on my husband's skillet were perfectly cooked and their breakfast meats were good. The only reason we did not give them five stars, is personally we want buttermilk pancakes to taste like buttermilk, and they didn't. That being said, the pancakes were very nice and fluffy. Would definitely recommend and we will be eating here again.",

When I arrived, I was greeted and seated with no wait (but this place can get packed on the weekends). After some consideration, I ordered the California scramble. It was so delicious that I stopped the waitress to tell her to thank the chef!!  My scramble came with avocado, bacon, chopped tomatoes and cheese mixed right into this soft, sou vide egg fluffiness!!! I've always preferred my eggs scrambled well but this dish has changed all that. I have been returning at least one a week for this breakfast.   I've also tried their Southwestern Salad for lunch,  which was also a winner. 'Butters' is owned by the same people that own Butterfield's so there is no doubt that they know food. I'd highly recommend this place.",

When we got here at 10:30 there was a 30 minute wait, which wasnt bad as crowded as it was.. When we were sat our server Heather was pretty quick with getting our order and recommended I add pancakes to my order for 99 cents rather than paying for a full order that I won't finish. Great tip!  I got the New Mexico Skillet with eggs over easy and a side of Oreo S'more chocolate chip pancakes! Can you say I am in Heaven!! It was sooo freaking delicious I want to copy these pancakes and make them every morning!!  My BF got the Santa Fe scrambler (which is weird because he doesn't like chorizo but he loves it here), Taffy Apple Toast and a side of Cinnamon Roll Cakes ( which he says he got for me lol).. And a glass of milk.  All that food came out in less than 15 minutes! We were surprised!  Everything was devoured in minutes!   The best part wasn't just the food, the price for all that food was only around $30!!  We will definitely keep coming here!",

Cheese grits were slightly sweet( not certain what type of cheese they use), so I'd get plain cheese next time. Santa Fe scrambled eggs were great, spicy & huge(took much home); home fries are sliced potato fries in a pan- asked for crispy: phenomenal. Pancake side(2) were fluffy & hot. Eggs verdes w/2 fried eggs was yummy; had black beans inside(gluten free). We three will definitely go here again. Told a 30-35 min wait. It was less than 20. We got drinks and waited outside. Wish we'd grabbed a menu while we were waiting (duhh). Overall: excellent!",

Only downside is that they can get pretty busy on the weekends, but it's only a sign of just how great the food is. Large portions, excellent services. A+",

It should have only been 20 minutes, but our buzzer wasn't working and nobody came looking for us when we didn't come in (we had to wait out by the fountain, because there was no room any closer to the door). I finally went in and asked only to see that over 10 other parties had been seated before us, even though they came after us. And to top it off, the hostess blamed us, saying we were out of reach. We stood as close as we could and others around us had buzzers that did work, so try another excuse.  As for the food, it's average. I got the pecan waffle with strawberries and my husband got the fried egg and bacon bagel sandwich with hash browns. I can't say the food was bad, but really not that flavorful and again, average. The best thing was the OJ.  I'm glad we finally tried it, because now we can cross it off the list for good.",

The grapefruit juice was fresh squeezed Ruby Red Grapefruit - not too bitter: just the right amount of sweetness.  My wife had the classic buttermilk pancakes, and they were excellent.  I had the Corned Beef Hash Skillet, and that was the best corned beef hash I've eaten.  The potatoes are thin sliced and sauted with onions, then the shaved corned beef is added toward the end to heat it through, using lean corned beef.  The flavor blend was perfect.  Prices were less than many other breakfast places in the area: All around excellent breakfast experience.",

We were a party of 4.5 and had to wait about 20 min (in 115 degree weather) at around 10:30AM but once we sat down, our orders were out very fast!  We ordered:   1. Corn Beef & Hash skillet with scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes (4 stars):  Good portion but the hash was scalloped potatoes and I was expecting shredded potatoes and the scalloped potatoes were just lacking flavor.    2. Brioche French Toast (4 stars): Solid with big portion.  3. Sausage and Biscuit (5 stars): Great flavor and super moist biscuit!!  4. Eggs Verde (4 stars): Good flavors and hearty but once again, the scalloped potatoes were not crispy and did not have much flavor.   Fresh squeezed OJ was the best!!",

Granted, it was mainly retired folk (or snowbirds). Despite being packed, we only waited about 5 minutes before a table was ready for us. We were taken to the back of the restaurant and sat in a booth with a window view. Our waitress was extremely quick to show up and take drink orders. I asked about the biscuits and gravy and she offered me a small taste of the gravy. I thought this was really nice of her and since it tasted pretty good, I ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs over easy. My dad ordered the Mexican egg burrito with sauce on top. In less than 10 minutes, our food arrived. My dad dug into his burrito and thought it was the best thing ever. I tried a small bite and it was good. My B&Gs were good, but after several bites into the dish, it was just too much. (I like a lot of sausage in my gravy and this one was lacking.) Definitely not the best B&Gs I've had and I wouldn't order them again from here if I came back.  Butter's has a lot of other tasty sounding items on their menu, but overall I wasn't impressed. There are a lot of other great breakfast places in Scottsdale that I'd much rather frequent.",

The Breakfast club uses an app called no wait where you can get in line before you get there, I think this place should try it. I asked about call ahead seating and they said they don't do that. This is the closest breakfast place to us so I was disappointed but its not that good that it is worth the wait.

Also, I've never had grits until I came here, and I thought they were good. Mind you I've never had them before so that may or may not be valid.  Service: I LOVED it. They were very quick (10 minutes between ordering and food being brought) and quiet. I really don't care for the wishy-washy over the time \"how is everything? Is there anything else I can get for you?\" service-- they came when I needed them and left when my needs were met.  The atmosphere tops it off-- the decor isn't super fancy but it's quiet enough to enjoy reading the paper.   Worth the 20 minute drive!",
