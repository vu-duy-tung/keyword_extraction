My husband had the Chicken sandwich with a very good side salad.

With a full bar and outside dinning area. This place can truly be a comfortable place to enjoy a meal anytime of day or year. 2. Food- The chef has a way around the plate. I ordered \"The Burger\". Nothing fancy but a great way to gauge the validity of the restaurant. Also had the Butternut squash soup, outstanding flavor.  3. Wait staff- Respectful, polite, courteous, attentive, and overall friendly. What you would expect from a waiter/waitess.   Overall, my girlfriend and I had a great time trying this new place in downtown glendale, enjoying a beer and burger while music played in the background. While this was the first time to Cuff Kitchen,  it will not be the last. I highly recommend it to you.   Remember to support your local restaurants and stores.",

We went during the week, around 5 PM, for catch-up and some beverages.  The menu is small and we ordered a burrata and some deviled eggs.  My friend had wine and I had some cocktails which were lovely.  We met the chef, who shared some of his ideas with us.  The meal itself was enjoyable all around.    I DO have a suggestion though:  our hostess was not very involved during our time there.  It's SO important to engage first-time customers; familiarity with the menu and the ability to make recommendations when asked are the way to create return business.  Ours was virtually non-existent and couldn't answer the most basic questions.  You may want to revisit her training as you build your clientele.  Best of luck to you, Cuff!",

The decor is pretty sweet looking when u first walk in. It has a modern, yet old school neighborhood bar feel to it. I like restaurants that are by the street to have big windows. To me its gives the restaurant life as you see the world around you passing by. Cuff has a huge window in front. Which when Glendale Glitters kicks off in about a month the view from Cuff should be fantastic.  The food felt pretty standard to me. I had the fried shrimp po'boy and it wasn't spectacular, and it wasn't bad either. The fries that came with it had a nice seasoning over it and they were very crispy. I just stuck with water so I don't know how good their drinks are. I will try Cuff again. Like I said its a nice addition to the town.",

It's a beautifully curated New American restaurant and bar w/ serious mixology under their sleeves. AND it's awesome!  The menu = well thought out, but nice and concise  The food = well-executed and delicious  The cocktails = on point, boozy, and well-crafted  The staff = attentive and knowledgeable   The vibe = 10/10  We ordered the Desert Breeze and the Glendale Thistle to start. Both were enchanting. The Glendale Thistle was a figgy/date garnished spin on an Old Fashioned, but served without ice and in a stemmed cocktail glass. The Desert Breeze featured an herbaceous, earthy tequila-like spirit called Ocho Cientos Blanco Sotol. So good, not your mother's (well, not my mother's) tequila cocktail either. It was strong, vegetal, citrusy, but not sweet. The flavors were refreshing and complex.   For food, we absolutely destroyed an order of the Deviled Eggs as an appetizer, which were garnished w/ pecan wood smoked bacon (yes), The Burger w/ fries, and the Pork Shoulder Sandwich w/ Caesar Salad. All great, but the Deviled Eggs were my favorite part of the meal.  If you live in the West Valley, you're crazy not to frequent this place. If you live in any other part of The Valley, this spot is WELL worth the drive. Do yourself a favor, eat and drink here as soon and as often as possible!",

Laid back atmosphere, great music playing, quiet enough to have a good conversation but not so quiet that everyone in the place can listen in.  Outstanding service both from the bar and the wait staff.    We tried several cocktails and was impressed with each.  My favorite was the blood orange margarita...delicious.  Food was really, really great bar food.  They obviously pride themselves on cooking a fairly simple menu especially well.  I appreciate that approach as a customer.  Highly recommend stopping in.  Only thing I didn't like were their hours being I wanted to stay longer and enjoy more tasty cocktails.",

I'm torn between what was more outstanding - the food or the delicious drinks made by Esteban the genius behind the bar.    We started out with sweet chili calamari and sweet corn. Both we very tasty and the drinks were a great pairing. I had HTG gin cocktail, while my wife opted for the bourbon infused Glendale Thistle. Our dining companion, Seal Beach Sue, ordered the bonded rye Barrel Cuff Sour. All three were so good another round was a must.     For the main course I ordered the Piggy Back burger, pork shoulder, beef, bacon, cheddar and caramelized onions. It was delicious but my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I had to bring half of it home. My wife ordered the shrimp club and there was so much shrimp they were falling all over the plate. SBS had the brisket and said she  would have given it 4 stars if not for the overload of BBQ sauce. All in all a great night out and we are already anxious to return.     P.S, after dinner take a stroll across the street and play some pinball at Lemoncade.",

The staff was friendly and did grab our order quickly. Our server was kind enough to keep checking in but we waited a rather long time for food. I ordered the street corn as an appetizer but it came out after our entrees and after I had to remind the server. My husband had the Piggyback Burger and I the Cuff Burger. Neither burger blew us away and mine was well done although ordered as medium, there was absolutely no pink to be found. By the time the street corn came, we were asking for boxes and the bill so I can't even say how it tastes yet.

What a great place for a casual dinner with friends.  I had the Green Chili Chicken Tacos which were especially tasty.  The others had 1. Fish Taco 2. Buffalo Chicken Sandwich 3.  Shrimp and Grits   Everyone enjoyed their dinners.  Cuff has an extensive beer menu.   The space is very clean and the service was excellent. And we were there for more than 2 hours without feeling that we had over stayed our visit.  I highly recommend Cuff.  Looking forward to a return visit.  Oh and next time I will try the Razzleberry Pie.",

I sat at the bar and the bartender gave good service and mixed a good drink.   There was a new trainee and he was nice if not a little lost as all trainees are. They were the only 2 people I had interaction with.   Food: I decided to try the deviled eggs and fish tacos with a tequila lime sauce. 2 things that probably should not be severed together but both were tasty.   My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the food was good but not great. Nothing was wrong but nothing was special. The deviled eggs tasted like grandma's deviled eggs good but not great. Same with the fish tacos good but not great. I have had better version of both.   I would come back but try other items",

There are few quality options in the Glendale/Peoria area and it seems that when one arrives, it doesn't last.  Anyway, we heard of Cuff on a recent episode on \"Plate and Pour\" on PBS (locally channel 8).  We recently went and it was terrific!  It happened to be on a Monday night and they have their food and drink happy hour specials available all day on Mondays.  I had the green chili pork taco plate and the deviled eggs (both on the happy hour menu).  The tacos were terrific and the deviled eggs, with bacon, were solid.  Others in our group had the Cuff burger, black bean burger, and the grits and shrimp.  All positive responses, no complaints.  The setting is casual, with a quaint bar, right in downtown Glendale.  Oh, Dominic was our server and he was fantastic!  We will be back...",

The sauce was decent with the right amount of heat but it appears that the meat was dipped in sauce to hide the dryness of the meat. I'm used to being able to cut my brisket with a fork however, this brisket was difficult to cut with a knife! To top it off, the brisket had no flavor and did not see any evidence of a smoke ring. Too bad because I saw a review of the place on TV and I was looking forward to having some good bbq at a locally owned restaurant!",

I am a diabetic so obviously this was not a great situation for me to be in. It got to late for me to eat by the time our food came. No real apology, no nothing.

I don't usually enjoy salads but this salad had a good, fresh mix of greens, goat cheese (yum), candied walnuts, and I think cranberries with a dash of peach vinaigrette. Eggplant parmesan was also delicious. I sat at the bar and ordered a drink, but none of the drink options looked too pleasant so I told the nice bartender to surprise me with something fruity. She came up with a concoction that she called \"the perfect storm.\" It was a blend of three different rums, pineapple, orange, and cranberry juice. I would definitely recommend. I also took my company there for round 2 for our Christmas dinner party and everyone absolutely loved it. We tried the butternut squash soup and it blew my mind! I would definitely recommend Cuff!",

I like the place itself - layout, decor, etc.  It is a bit cozy but expected for an older building in downtown Glendale.  There's a decent amount of items on the happy hour menu, best deal if you are going to eat there.  The staff was nice and attentive, however our experience with the food was not the best.  While at the bar, the gentleman next to me ordered calamari and the plate was cold and his calamari was cool/cold.  The bartender did return it to the kitchen and warm food came shortly.  I shrugged it off.  My wings were good but a bit spicy for being the only sauce option - my older parents, in their late 60s, would not be able to handle these.  The pasole was good, I enjoyed the interpretation and would get again.  The majority of our table ordered burgers and everyone had the same thoughts - cold buns, cold plates and some of the burgers themselves were cool.  I am not sure if the restaurant is not used to being busy or if the kitchen staff just wasn't on their game that night, but these seem like simple things were overlooked that patrons expect anywhere.  I will probably give Cuff another chance, but these items are things management needs to pay attention to and fix or people will go elsewhere.",

Honestly I have so many good things to say; friendly staff, amazing food, KILLER sangria, dog friendly patio **our fave, it feels like home.   Our go-tos are the Sangria 43, crab puffs, a charcuterie board and the sweet chili shrimp. But everything is absolutely delicious.",

Deviled eggs were soso. Wife ordered the cuff mac which she liked but said it was very rich. I had shrimp and grits sans cajun seasoning and marinara sauce. Grits were creamy topped with chunky andouille sausage. The shrimp were plump and juicy. Overall a really good meal. Not so for the banana cream pie we tried to share for dessert. Crust was graham cracker and was so buttery as to be cloying. We only took a couple of bites and left it. Our waitress offered a to go box which we declined, she did not ask why we left it or offer to remove it from our tab. Not very intuitive. I would have wanted to know why it was not eaten. There are other items on the menu we would like to try so will return and pass up dessert.",

    "text": "Very nice staff! Great group effort overall. First time here so walking in we didn't know if it was a seat yourself type of place or not (no signs telling us otherwise) but a waitress was quick to greet us and we chose to sit at the bar...which turned into a half blessing/half mistake. I say blessing because almost everyone who walked behind the bar helped to take care of us (cleaning up dishes, refilling drinks, etc). Had the calamari app to start which was fine. The sweet chili sauce had a nice evenness between sweet and heat. Entrees was the pulled pork sandwich and the shrimp n' grits. The sandwich was great, and the shrimp n' grits was great too. I only wish that they had put more grits in the bowl instead of more of the sauce they put into it. It's not the the sauce was bad or anything, but it felt more like a stew that had grits and shrimp thrown into it. It made it so that I only really tasted the sauce and almost nothing else. It still tasted nice though! The real star of the night was the desserts. One of the men behind the bar told us about them and as soon as he said 'Pumpkin Bread Pudding' my mom was sold and they also had Creme Brulee so we split both between us and both were fantastic! I'd highly recommend this place just for their desserts and service except...one last thing. Yeah this is why I said half blessing and half mistake because this happened right in front of us. My mom saw a man behind the bar (she said he had black hair with a small ponytail) sneeze and then not wash his hands, and he proceeded to slice fruit for drinks. He wore gloves but kept wiping his nose on the edges of the gloves. He was also the only one who walked behind the bar and never acknowledged us, but I don't hold that against him since we never ordered drinks. It must be a little awkward to have people sit at the bar and not order a drink. I still think we'll be back, because everyone else was stellar and were super friendly! Prices are pretty decent too! For one app, two entrees, and two desserts the bill was just above $60 with tip!",

    "text": "Affordable, traditional eats with great value make Cuff an accessible spot that's woefully overlooked.  The eats are predominately American, with accessible sandwiches like burgers (which are good) and eggplant parmesan (which was really good), but with a southwestern (Tequila-lime fish tacos, posole) and Louisianan (Cajun fries, Po' Boys, Grits) flair.   The happy hour is absolutely solid! You can grab some lunches on the cheap. I'm talking 8-10 bucks for a sandwich and fries, which aren't mind-blowing but still felt like a steal for the quality you're getting. The happy hour alone makes Cuff worth it.  One can also spy a modest cocktail menu to wash these down with. I'd enjoyed one featuring gin and thyme. While refreshing and well-presented, it lacked the complexity to make it a True premium beverage. You can't just throw sprigs of stuff in there...you kinda have to muddle it or something, ya know? Take it to the next level.   I do like this place, but I think my four stars is going to be more of a reflection on value than quality. Still not a place to overlook if you're in downtown Glendale.",

The happy hour menu offered almost everything at a dollar off, so that was cool.  Unfortunately the execution of the food was off. My friend ordered the shrimp po'boy which was the hit of the night. I ordered calamari and grilled fish tacos. The calamari breading didn't stay on- and was extremely greasy. The fish tacos were very soft, and almost underdone and completely unseasoned. They were accompanied by delicious dipping sauces- but still- a little salt & pepper would have gone a long way.   Overall, this place isn't my favorite, and unless we just happened to be in the area- I probably wouldn't go back",

It's quirky AND warm, with a spectacular kitchen.  I had the best Moscow Mule I have ever had, you could really taste the balance between the fig vodka and the aperol liqueur they added -- so much more than just ginger beer with some vodka splashed in it.  My Pozole with Pulled Pork Potstickers and Cotija Cheese was extraordinary, as was my companion's Shrimp and Grits.  The \"grits\" were really like exceptionally well made polenta, fluffy and firm, not greasy and sloppy.  So delicious.  I'll return often, hope most of Phoenix will as well!",

This is the first place we'll think to go to, and it's where we take any visitors first. It took us seven months to find that kind of place in Glendale, but Cuff is it.  I was honestly shocked when I walked through the front door. This is a \"downtown\" bar with a local feel. That's a tough line to walk (both in appearance and on the menu) but Cuff makes it seem effortless.  Chris was one of the most passionate bartenders I've spoken to. You could tell that he sincerely loved making tasty cocktails and coming up with interesting drinks. The food was also excellent.   It's only been a week since our initial visit and I can't wait to go again. Great ambiance, and they do a lot of their own infusions for cocktails. Awesome.",

Several of the dishes we had used sweet chili sauce, might be a little more creative.  We had cheese balls, which were like a crab rangoon minus the crab taste, very very deep fired.  About 1-2 minutes less and it would have been better.  Split the shrimp poboy, tasty, but only 5 shrimp on the plate.  Also had the calamari - that was my favorite.

Even though we went on a Saturday evening, it wasn't busy and we were seated right away. The service was great as well. Our waitress went out of her way to find out about different menu options for us and kept checking back to make sure everything was going well.

It would be a great introduction to vegan burgers for anyone who is reluctant to try plant-based food. They also have some jackfruit dishes which we will try next time. We also loved the street corn, which was perfectly cooked so that the corn is easy to eat off the cob, yet firm so you get that juicy crunch. The perfect amount of chile, hot but not too hot for gringo palates. The spices are close to traditional Mexican style, but with a twist, like a reimagined street corn without being nouveau cuisine or too Americanized. And don't get me started on the cocktails! Unique recipes, flawlessly executed every time. Their rye old fashioned with a giant ice cube was one of the best I've had. The service is always so friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is unique and inviting. There is so much to love about this place!",

    "text": "Oh where to begin with this misbegotten mistake of a place.  The Pros: 'Decent atmosphere', relatively clean (For a place that scores a B from the Health Department - big nono, something is up there) and at least some parking.  The Cons:  There is literally nothing made here.  Everything is prepacked, frozen garbage.  Most of the dessert is Marie Calendar pies. The fish is frozen tilapia - if that's your bag, go right ahead but at the prices they're charging you're better off at Pete's down the road.  How is a an Eggplant Parm not vegetarian?  But apparently they can pull that off!  Amazing!  13 for a burger you bought prepackaged, overcooked and dress with spring mix!  Wow, so impressive!!!!  Buying impossible patties and dressing it with more spring mix!  So impressive!!!  Frozen fish tacos, wowwee!!!  Don't even get me started on the beer or service.  When I made a comment about the fact there was more foamy head than actual beer, they did send another beer but attempted to charge me for it - like um?  You can't even pour a beer?  The food didn't take too long to get to my table, but it was obviously the wrong order for another table that just happened to be similar to ours.  (Sorry other customers for not realizing sooner!). On top of that, our party was apparently expected to wait 20 minutes for our bill while the servers socialize, goof off and smoke cigarettes.  (Looking at you Blondie, you were the absolute worst one.)  TLDR; You're better off spending your money elsewhere if you don't like getting ripped off.  P.S - According to a regular at the bar, they've been through 5 chefs in less than 6 months.  Hardly surprising - there is nothing consistent about this place at all other than shit service and premade food.",

Enjoyed a couple of adult beverages and shared some appetizers. All good enough but not killer either. Pricing slightly on the high side.   This review would have been more generous had we not had a couple of off-putting service issues:   1)Yes, I get it that one of Cuff's marketing points is craft cocktails. I'd have been more impressed had our bartender not gone full '80s Tom Cruise and actually juggling the shaker. Awkward and kind of embarrassing.   2)Just as we were halfway through drink #2, said bartender advised he was going home, as he was not feeling well, and his colleague would be completing our service. OH dear, so sorry to hear, do feel better soon.   Insert miraculous recovery here. Mere minutes later this same person returned back behind the bar solely to let down his bun and shake out his locks and rake his fingers through his hair. (Really?  Hello health code violation.) It then became obvious that bartender Esteban transitioned into dining room server Esteban.   Cuff?  We thought you were better than this. We were hoping for something more refined and less wanna-be.   Sorry. One and done for us. :(",

Also, great location for someone looking to check out \"old town Glendale\".  I'm eager to see what's going to be on their menu and new drinks that spring up in the near future. Great establishment!",

I ordered a pear ale which was light and fruity and I enjoyed it.  For dinner I ordered the brisket with a field green, goat cheese and pecan salad topped with a peach vinaigrette.  The brisket was moist and fell apart like it should with a South Carolina BBQ sauce that was really good, with a tiny little kick.  My salad was fresh and crisp and the dressing was flavorful.  It also came with coleslaw which I could tell was made fresh as it was very crisp and I enjoyed it. Our server was friendly, courteous and attentive.",

In fact nothing was bland about the place or the food! The pork ribs were... well wonderful, saucy and tender. And the fried rice , 3 people at my table went back for more!!! The fried rice!!! It was tasty and mildly seasoned with a wonderful herb, tarragon I think...you have to taste it to believe it!!! So good! The hand made salad dressing, others at my table went back for more salad( we were in a group of 80, and so were served buffet style , thus we could return for seconds). And the location couldn't be better, across from beautiful Glendale Glitters and the Municipal parking garage ( which has no cost in the evening)! Simple And sweet for that Friday date nite or any nite!!",

The 4 of us met just after 5 pm on a Thursday night. It was Happy Hour pricing, $2-$3 off regular pricing, which was cool. I had the Pork Belly Tacos, with a small mixed green salad. Both were very tasty. 2 gals had the Tequila Lime Fish Tacos (one had grilled, the other fried fish). Both said it was good. Our 4th gal ordered the Eggplant Parmesan sandwich with a side mixed green salad. All of us finished everything on our plate. One of my girlfriends had a Cosmo. She said it was good, although she felt it was a bit on the small side for what she paid. We all agreed that if this place was in Scottsdale, it would probably be crowded. While we did like that we could easily have a conversation with each other, there weren't enough people there to really give it a good, active vibe. Maybe we were there on a really slow night at a really slow time...",

We chalked it up to the restaurant being new and still working out the kinks. They had what appeared to be construction workers coming from the kitchen so maybe there was just a ton going on back there and the attention to detail was lost. I would however recommend the bar, looks like a nice place to get a drink especially during Glendale glitters!",

The wait staff and customer service needs improvement.  They weren't busy and it took forever (after motioning them several times) to order a round of drinks, food, and water (typically customary).  It took them 15 minutes (I actually timed it) to ask us if we wanted some more water or drinks (they were visibly empty and we tried to get their attention multiple times).  We closed our tab, paid, signed the check and several minutes later the bartender alerted me that they mis-ran the check and forgot to add one of the beers.  Now, I eat out a lot .. any decent restaurant would have just not said anything or would have not requested additional payment for a $5 beer after the customer closed a $50 tab.  They re-ran the check and made me re-pay/sign for it .. and then it got billed twice to me.  Normally I would have just tipped the bartender the different in amount (but she was too dull to process that concept).  Amusingly, our food was rung through a second time and came out again.  Also, a reasonable restaurant would have maybe offered to box it up for us as it was their mistake -- nope, they continued to act totally clueless and probably just threw it in the trash.  This place has a cool atmosphere and could be really good if they get their customer service act together.  The chef/owner was clueless and didn't even walk over and apologize -- rude.",

It's awesome because their American restaurant is linked to Zang (an Asian bistro just around the corner) so you can order off of either menu. This makes it a great spot when you can't decide where to eat because there is a wide array of options. They also have a pastry chef so save room for dessert!   Aside from the great food & drinks I enjoy the atmosphere in the restaurant and the staff has always been friendly.",

Cuff also now has gift cards available to which I purchased two this morning and hope our guests enjoy a nice evening and dinner.  We want Cuff to be successful here in Glendale and trust with a few tweaks and Tom Harvey's willingness to satisfy customers in any way he can, Cuff will be a town favorite. We will continue to be supportive patrons.",

The menu is small but only because they're testing it to get the best selection before making it permanent. Everyone we dealt with was super friendly and awesomely informative. Great architectural details make it cozy and hip. Oh yes and the food was delicious!",

They get an extra star just for the location. And the burger I ordered was awesome- probably the second or third best I've had in the Valley at this price point ($10 ish for a burger with fries). Hubs had brisket that they were smoking out back and it had a nice little kick to it. We also ordered the meat and cheese platter, which was all right but nothing special. They had to bring the listed olives separately because they forgot them on the platter. I also saw a table nearby sending back food because it wasn't what they had ordered (issue with getting a side dish right I think). Service was friendly but a bit slow and disorganized. Hopefully they get that together soon because this could be a great West Valley staple. I also wonder if they will do something to integrate with the community theater that is right next door. Dinner and a show could be a fantastic deal there.",

We ordered the flatbread for an appetizer and it was pretty good.  There were five of us and we each shared different sandwiches including the pork shoulder and fried shrimp po boy. Everyone was happy with their food. Being a new restaurant, I think they have a few things to work out but overall we were impressed. Our server was pleasant and fun and the chef came over and asked us how the food and experience was which is a big bonus in my book. Team Cuff!",

Excited to see if this can be maintained   Dinner: Piggy Back burger -- my dad loves it!  Burger cooked perfectly!  So good!  My dad ate every bite!   Cuff burger -- good flavor....raw middle.  Was able to eat around the outside, good flavor and the bacon was awesome.  Disappointed and only able to eat about half due to the raw meat.  Server came and apologized, offered to fix it but too late by that time.  He did take the plate to show the new cook, good learning reference.   Buffalo chicken sandwhich -- good flavor, good amount of spice.  Husband said he would order it again.    Dessert - banana cream pie.  Sooo good!  Get for sure!    Service was okay - very nice and informative, but no refills on soda and beers.  Food - good flavor, raw burger was disappointing, pie was great!    We will try it again -- it was a good place, good people, good food.  Room for improvement, but then it will be better next time!",

I also tried the vegan Mexican corn it was tasty too. This is a cute bar/restaurant locals seem to really dig it here and the staff members do a great job of making you feel welcomed. This spot has got great food that Vegans and their non-vegan friends and family can enjoy.",

Our meals were attractively presented and were just as delicious as they looked.  The owners are on site and interested in talking with their guests.  We were originally referred here by our son and were delighted to hear that we also have other family who know the owners as well.  Our party ordered the Fish n Chips, Cuff Hamburger, Cuff Wings and the Pork Shoulder sandwich.  Each one was delicious.  The Cuff coleslaw was unlike any other experienced and made a Cuff convert of a  Cole slaw non-lover to a Cole slaw lover!",

Limited inside seating with a bar for cocktails.  We chose to eat outside next to a heater.    Everything on the menu sounded good with some vegan options.  Cocktails are handcrafted to order.   I had the sangria that included bitters, fresh juices and lots of fruit.   My wife had the smashed margarita with a nice crust of salt on the rim.   Baja tacos each has some decent pieces of grilled fish and a Baja sauce.  Side sauces were crema and a roasted salasa.    The slaw in the tacos has a crisp vinegar flavor that paired well with both sauces.  No sides with this dish.   My wife had a fried shrimp po'boy.  The shrimp were very large and with lots of greens.  My wife eyed my crema to add a bit more sauce to the sandwich.  The Cajun fries were good.   I strongly recommend Cuff.  If you go to the Tanger outlet mall it's worth the trip down the road.",

Traditionally it is made with French bread, this was more a store bought sub roll.  It couldn't hold everything.  French fries were mediocre.  Also, we started with the calamari.  For the price the serving was much smaller than the average place.  There was  a lot of the coating underneath vs. calamari.  Flavor was fine, but a little spicy for my taste. I had a martini and it was o.k.  Pluses:  Interesting whiskeys/liqours,  neat atmosphere, interesting menu Cons:  Slower service, food presentation, martini taste, closes at 10 p.m. on a Saturday",

The happy hour has decent food specials, with many regular menu items 2-3$ off. I started with their version of a Moscow mule, which was ah mazing! So so good. They infuse Tito's with fig and add basil, serious legit drinkage. For food, I tried the deviled eggs... very tasty.... the burger - also super good topped with cheese and bacon, yum!, and the pulled pork sandwich - the only thing that was so so. The pulled pork was spicy, which I like, but didn't have much else in the way of flavor. I'd stick with the burger next time (or maybe some Chinese food, ha!). Their fries were also killer.... crunchy and seasoned perfectly. The service here was on point, we had to turn the waitress away from filling our waters. We will definitely be back!",

My sister loved her shrimp and grits and my son finished the entire peppered beef dish. The portions were large, we were pleasantly surprised.

There is a small bar with maybe six seats, not a lot of tables and a patio. The decor is nice and it's a really cute place. Some guys at the bar suggested the chicken wings and said they were delicious. We ordered the chicken wings and tacos. The chicken wings didn't have much sauce on them and smelled really weird. I'm not joking, they had a weird smell. And, they tasted terrible. The tacos came plain with some kind of sauce and coleslaw on the side. It was one small piece of fish on a tortilla that didn't even taste like it was warmed. The wine was expensive and it was \"happy hour.\" The food was terrible, prices are high and the only reason I gave this place two stars is because of the nice bartender. I believe his name was Zach. It wasn't a good experience.",

The menu is surprisingly brief; a few appetizers, a few sandwiches, and a few entrees. I ordered a Malbec wine which was served chilled. When I asked for my red wine at room temperature, the server replaced my glass with wine that was so sour that it tasted like vinegar. I didn't complain - it's a new place and I'm sure they are working out the kinks. However, no red wine drinker I know of, drinks their wine chilled.  Anyway, I ordered the Cuff Posole, which I was told by the server that people love so much that one customer liked his plate. It was OK. I'm not a smoked pork fan, and it seems almost every dish consists of smoked pork. I'd prefer it with chicken.  My husband ordered the eggplant parm sandwich. It was delicious and the salad that came with was equally delish.  I'd like to see more variety on the menu, more dishes made with chicken, and my red wine served at room temp!",

I understand when waitresses forget to put in an order or if the kitchen gets backed up but usually the staff would apologize for this type of hold up. The restaurant wasn't even busy. After my husband waited 15 minutes for his food after everyone else had finished theirs you think they would have come over and been apologetic and said \"I'm so sorry for the delay, dessert is on us\" or something to display proper customer service. We won't be visiting again.",

I was promptly greeted but even better the bartender and waitress didn't just serve us they engaged in conversation. Not just casual conversation we talked as if we had known each other for years. I felt very welcomed in there. I'm huge on customer service and they exceeded my expectations! The food was and drinks were also good! If I wasn't drive I'd probably still be there with a Moscow mule  in my hand lol!       I had the fish tacos and I recommend getting the fish tacos grilled (Thank me later)! As I was sitting there I started to pay more attention to the music and I was asking about the songs. I love music in general but I wasn't really introduced to classic rock until the night I came to Cuff. I kid you not I downloaded about 7 Van Halen songs lol! I was up in there getting my groove on! It's a great vibe and a good feel at Cuff you won't be disappointed!      Speaking of not being disappointed, the bread pudding...MY GOD!!!!! Have you ever tasted something so good you wanted to pay double for it? Yes you have in fact you're probably in your car now driving to Cuff to see what this bread pudding is all about! DON'T BE ON YOUR PHONE WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING! Trust me when I say this though the bread pudding is the best bread pudding I've had EVER! I was in the Navy for five years and I've had bread pudding in different countries but then one at Cuff is the Michael Jordan of bread Pudding!       Lastly the owner (I wish I could remember her name) she was such a sweetheart! Her attitude and attentiveness were so good I see why she's running a successful business. She stopped in the middle of working to show me around. The patio area has a little Italy type vide to it I loved it! They also have a live music venue where bands come and play. Long story short I'm looking forward to visiting Cuff. It was truly a great experience!",

The vegan menu offers two different types of burgers plus jack fruit options (bbq, tacos, etc.). My mother-in-law usually goes for healthier options, but the pork shoulder sandwich captured her appetite. I had the black bean burger, which was good but somewhat plain. My husband had the jack fruit BBQ sandwich. He liked it a lot, but needed to ask for more BBQ sauce. The cajun fries were particularly good!  Service was great - no issues at all.   We probably wouldn't go out of our way to eat here, but it was a great option for a pleasant vegan meal!",

    "text": "So FULL DISCLOSURE here I am starting a \"Collection\" here on YELP about my Favorite Vegan Spots in the Valley of the Sun and what better way to start it than with CUFF. This place is OFF THE CUFF...LOL...no doubt it and as you will notice with most of my reviews pertaining to my new \"Collection\" my primary focus will be on the best burger on EARTH...The Impossible Burger. So if you haven't heard about it yet I am going to help you...it basically tastes like or better than any burger you have EVER had...I am soooo serious. Those that have had it can attest to my sincerity about this slice of heavenly protein cooked well and served with a smile.  Now how it is served and how much it costs is very IMPORTANT... because every restaurant presents it a little differently. Here is how it is done at CUFF...THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER plant-based burger patty, cheddar cheese, caramelized onion....lettuce, tomato, pickle.   The Cheddar cheese is VEGAN but there is no mayo...so if you want it you have to ask and make sure it is VEGAN otherwise bring your own. Please be advised the wife and I always ask about the cheese and mayo before we even arrive because if they don't have it we will bring our own and we are not ashamed...LOL. The Restaurants give us NO grief about it at all and we have had no issues whatsoever.  The Burger comes with your choice of Cajun Fries and/or a signature salad all for $14.00 per person. This is by FAR the best deal for the Impossible burger considering the Fries are included. So if you're in Glendale and searching for a GREAT BURGER this is definitely the place you want to visit. They also have a nice little bar and despite all the foot and automobile traffic out front, this place is pretty awesome. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!",

I'm writing this review because of a rehearsal dinner that was recently hosted at the Cuff.  I didn't even know they were able to do such events.  We were given our own space which included bathrooms separate from the restaurant.  Mouthwatering food, amazing service, and a beautiful place.  We couldn't have asked for more and the Bride and Groom will always be thankful they decided on Cuff.",

    "text": "Cuff offers some interesting food in old town Glendale for a reasonable price. My wife ordered a burger that she pegged as the second (or third) best she's had in the valley. I had the brisket which had a nice little kick to it.  The meat and cheese plate felt a bit underwhelming. 1 cheese, a couple VERY thin slicers of a couple cured meats. Almonds. 3 pieces of bread. Mustard and some kind of preserve. We had to ask for the olives separately. That meat board is probably the main reason why I'm thinking 4 stars instead of 5.  Service was friendly but a tad slow. The bartender served us and he was friendly but when he had to tend bar, things got a bit slow. The restaurant is attempting to hire more staff so hopefully the speed will get better in time.  Restaurant has a nice decor and was clean. They have a full bar and the prices seemed reasonable. I would wish for a couple decent local brews on tap but I guess there are other options nearby for that.  Overall the West Valley could use more places like this and I'm looking forward to trying more food and hopefully they are able to get fully staffed in the future.",

He came up and started talking to us about his new place down the street. He was so friendly so we instantly had to check this new place out. What an excellent decision it was! Immediately upon entering I saw the copper mugs and knew they served moscow mules. Tom told us about their house made fig infused vodka for the moscow mules and we quickly ordered 3. Extremely well crafted and absoloutely delicious!! I could have easily down 3 of those! Since we were heading to Haus Murphy's after our cocktails for dinner, we only ordered an appetizer. We ordered the meat/cheese/olive plate and wow oh wow!!! It was only $10 and well worth it. 3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our moscow mules! The staff was incredibly friendly and talkative as well. Tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well. He showed us the original brick wall towards the back, which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place. The patio wasn't quite finished, but it will be awesome once done! Love the beautiful iron gate! Hopefully this new place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out! Glendale definitely needs a cool place like this! Tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment!!",

They added a bacon slice to the veggies as a garnish and this again was good. Hubby ordered the smoked brisket as the main course which by far was divine. It was so good I almost slapped the waiter. I ordered the cuff posole & this was the perfect amount of flavors mended together. They put pork pot stickers in it and the entire dish was also fantastic! I recommend this place 100%. Try brisket or the posole and you won't be disappointed!! We were seated quickly & the waiter was prompt with his service and very gracious. I can't wait to go again!!!

The attention to detail is impressive, really like the pendant fixtures over bar area.    Our server was very helpful and recommended the calamari as an appetizer.  Was very lightly breaded, which is a plus, and I really liked the spicy drizzle sauce.  Entrees were very good, I had the chicken club and my partner had the pozole.  If you are a traditionalist when it comes to pozole, this isn't for you.  If you enjoy updated spins on traditional dishes, you'll really enjoy it.  The pork wontons in the pozole were great.  Really enjoyed myself and appreciative of this restaurant in an area that has never had much selection.    As a note, the prices are very reasonable too.",

I ordered an Eggplant Parm Sandwich and it was the best eggplant I think I've ever had.  I was sorry to finish it.  We also ordered the Spicy Sweet Crispy Calamari and it was so delicious. I couldn't believe how amazing the food was.  As a visitor from New York, I guess I was a little shocked to find food that rivaled some of NY's finest.  The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress was really sweet and helpful with choosing what we wanted.  I wish I lived in AZ just so I could go to Cuff again!",

Would recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner. Great food, great service!",

    "text": "Inconsistent  I loved the meal I had last time in this very cute small historic area of Glendale. They still do serve up hand crafted above average cocktails in an old charm atmosphere and offer an American Comfort Food Menu with comfortable prices.  The brisket was so darn great last time I decided to order it.  It was not the same as last time as it was kind of dry. It still had a tasty flavor but was not that fresh kind of melt in your mouth kind of brisket. The brisket did have some fat to it but it just seemed like leftover meat with fat. It was still passable and not bad but also not great like last time. The slaw was ok and the fries were hot and fresh but boarder line over salted. For me they were hard to eat but my husband ate them. I would still recommend to try the brisket because if you hit them on a good day the brisket might be outstanding.  Based on the shrimp and grits my husband had I would not recommend the shrimp and grits. A small mound of grits sat in the bottom of the bowl and was topped with a large amount of red sauce that diluted the grits into nothing but soup. It became just red sauce mixed with grits that got worst from the undercooked poached egg on top that had some raw whites that did nothing positive to this dish. My husband ate it without sending it back. I would not have been able to eat his dish.   I hate like hell to drop this place a star and HOPE that maybe the regular cook was just off that night.  You should still give this place a try when in the area I just wanted to keep my review honest.",

    "text": "Downtown Glendale is in desperate need of more places like Cuff where you can get a delicious meal and cocktail in a welcoming and clean environment.  I can rave about the filet mignon I had the first time I came and then I brought a friend back and we shared some deviled eggs.  Everything I've eaten has been absolutely delicious.  Their cocktail menu is short but has everything you need - very tasty whiskey drinks.  The establishment is clean, the decor is casual and the seating is comfy, its the kind of place that you'd want to stay a while and lose track of time over great food and drinks with friends.  So why only 4 stars?  I've been three times and the staff is consistently aloof and working on their disappearing act.  They don't appear to have any career servers, but young people who may be on their first job, which is totally fine but they aren't supervised or given direction.  I think I pinpointed the manager because I hear her ask the staff to do things for her but it's obvious that she's a fish out of water and she usually has a scowl on her face.  I really hope they can get some good help because Cuff is 5 stars in everything else.",

David was an attentive host who made us feel right at home.  We love supporting small businesses, especially the ones that go the extra mile.  We were seated promptly (we made a reservation), our server was always checking in but never hovering.  Our menu questions were answered with confidence and the food was fresh and interesting.  We had the cheese puffs (yes!), and I was told the salad and fish tacos were excellent, though I didn't try either.  I did sample my daughter's \"fish fry\" and really liked it.  However, I was the table winner with the old style posole!  Get it.  You will not be disappointed!",

This remarkable little spot is right downtown on Glendale Ave, across from the library.  Plenty of very nearby free parking.  Our server was just excellent, explaining the daily specials and making suggestions.  My wife had their Cuff burger and I opted for the grilled fish tacos. Both of these dishes were well beyond our expectations.  My wife's burger was cooked to medium rare perfection.  The beef was tasty and, when the wrong french fries were served to her, our server immediately had a replacement order in and on the table in minutes.  They were fresh out of the fryer, piping hot, and just the perfect texture. I haven't had better fish tacos this side of San Diego.  Three tacos on the plate were just the perfect quantity.  The fish was delicious and the pico d gallo excellent!  Couldn't have asked for a better lunch.  If we didn't live so far away we'd return again and again. This is a real gem for downtown Glendale.  The city has done a great job revitalizing its downtown area, with nice shops and a good number of varied-menu restaurants.  Good for them!!  Maybe they could give some tips to Mesa's leaders (hint, hint).",

Its location in a historic building in old-town Glendale gives it an authentic ambiance. Clearly this is a locals' favorite. We chose to eat at the bar rather than at one of the tables. The friendly people on both sides of the bar made us feel 100% welcome. There's a \"family-feel\" among the employees, and they clearly take pride in the delicious original dishes and cocktails they've created. Excellent craft beers on draft.  We arrived and had to depart too early for the comedy shows next door, but apparently that's a plus as well. We'll put this place on our must-do list for future Spring Training trips.",

I had a mixed green salad on the side with walnuts, cranberries, goat cheese in a pear vinaigrette. I thought I would regret not getting fries on the side, but no I loved the salad. The server raved about this locally made buttermilk pie. We ordered it. Omg I told my friend I had died and gone to heaven. I now have to try Shelley's Bakery where it's made.

    "text": "Went to Cuff for dinner and drinks before walking around Glendale Glitters last night, and had a great experience. Weather was nice, so we opted to sit out on the patio. Started with some drinks and a charcuterie board, all of which was very good. I enjoyed an HGT, and my husband had an Old Fashioned, and they were both very well mixed with garnishes that complemented the drinks nicely. The charcuterie board had a good variety of cheeses, meats, olives, nuts, and berries, and was served with a flatbread.  For our entrees, I had the shrimp po boy sandwich, and my husband had the house burger. Both were served with cajun-seasoned fries, and we had no complaints with the food. The shrimp in my sandwich were very good, with a light breading that didn't make the meal feel too heavy. We had a few more drinks, my favorite of which was their house spin on the Moscow Mule. They use a fig-infused vodka that is absolutely delicious, as well as an extra-spicy ginger beer, that really adds a ton of flavor to the drink. We were very happy to see a variety of locally-sourced products on the menu, and that the bar staff were using the herbs planted on the patio for use in their drinks! Doesn't get any fresher than that! We were both very happy with our first visit to Cuff, and would like to come back and check out their other offerings, since it looks like their menu rotates seasonally. We talked to several members of the wait/bar staff, and they were all very friendly and personable, and helped to make our experience so positive.  Definitely recommend for a chill date night, or for happy hour!",

    "text": "Having lunch at this cocktail bar/grill.  Really cool spot. It has a bar & grill look, with a cocktail/diner feel.  The 8oz cuff burger with cajun fries - with a Left Hand nitro brew.  Both were good. The burger was more well done than than it was medium, how I ordered it, but no big deal.  Maybe next time they'll get it right.  But the mai tai stole the show. It's strong- and it comes with a flaming sugar cube that dissolves into the drink.   They also have a small garden in the back patio - where they pick their own herbs and use their own mint for their Mojitos.  Pretty dope.",

She was awesome to our son. We had a party of 5 and lovers everything we had. We had a couple of fish fries, wings, tempura shrimp and the meat and cheese board. We will be back!",

We went for happy hour and got the burrata to start, followed by the fish tacos (for me) and the eggplant parm sandwich (for my friend). I'd definitely recommend all three of those dishes (I didn't try the eggplant but my friend loved it), and I would come back here to try other things as well.",
