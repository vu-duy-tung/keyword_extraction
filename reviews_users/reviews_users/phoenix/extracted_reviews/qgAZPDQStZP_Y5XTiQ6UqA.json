    "text": "No one does Tuesday nights quite like Postino. The Tempe/Annex location is a prominent social hub as evidence by the inclusive crowd (coworkers, significant others, prominent fixtures, etc.; seriously, Chris Newstrom, was that you sitting across the bar?!) who have made the weekday pilgrimage to the Annex. Even from a distant parking lot you can hear the muffled chatters of people rubbing elbows with one another.   Inside, the atmosphere is fast-paced yet intimate and evocative. Do yourself a huge favor: situate yourself at the bar, get cozy and ask for Mark (great server, bartender and all-around nice guy).  Selecting a bruschetta board is largely preferential, but try the smoked salmon with pesto, as well as the brie and apples paired with a cabernet sauvignon.  This is a wonderful way to win(e)d down and definitely a go to spot for any evening get together.",

My husband was never a big fan of bruschetta but after coming here, he loves it. I appreciate that they cut each bruschetta into four pieces and that you can order four different kinds for your board. They offer both sweet and savory options so it's nice that you can have a variety. The olives came in a descent sized bowl, enough to share for a table of four. I haven't tried any of their other appetizers but I'm impressed with their bruschetta selection for sure.",

I do wish the salad had more greens - was mostly quinoa and toppings. We also enjoyed the $5 glasses of wine! Would definitely recommend this place if you are in Tempe! Great spot for a relaxing and delicious lunch!",

    "text": "Hipster/Romantic setting. Service is always great here. Nothing to complain other than waiting time. Sometime(especially on Monday and Tuesday nights for $20 deal-bottle of wine and a bruschetta board) the place does get busy and you might have to wait up to an hour for a table. A good way to get around this is that you can make a reservation at anytime with a party of 6 or more. If you don't meet that requirement, there are also seats by the bar. I personally like the bar since the service there is more personalized and quick due to the many bartenders that are always there.   Favorite and most basic wine choice for me here is their Moscato. Their bruschetta board is always amazing but if you want to try something new, always ask for the seasonal, it's most likely to be delicious. Also, check out the panini and soup combo if you're not up to eating bruschetta. If you still have room for more, try their creme brulee, you won't be disappointed.",

The interior of the venue has the trendy decor of a wine bar with plenty of booth and bar seating. The outdoor patio is softly lit and kept cool with numerous misters. The music is modern and upbeat and just loud enough to be heard over the cacophony of conversations that will certainly surround but should not overwhelm you.  On to the food! The half sandwich/half salad deal is perfect for lunch or a light dinner. I tried the chicken and mozzarella sandwich and the raspberry chicken salad--both were sumptuously scrumptious! The salad was a perfect blend of greens and nuts and chicken and fruit. The sandwich was a fantastic compilation of tender chicken, fresh mozzarella, soft bread, and just the right amount of spicy mayo.  Finally, the staff is superbly friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. Don't know what you want? Just ask! They can help you choose just the right pairing of food and wine to make your day.",

Luckily, the wait wasn't that long so we were still able to sit and eat before the show. However, with that being said, I really love this new location and you can never go wrong with delicious Postino food!  They created a really open and inviting atmosphere and there is plenty of room to stretch out. They have a spacious patio and then an open and airy indoor section of the restaurant. When the weather is nice, it's great that you can be sitting inside and still enjoy a breeze thanks to the large garage style doors that they have open.   I am a Postino junkie and love their bruschetta boards. They are by far the best in town. My favorite bruschetta by far is the tomato jam. Now don't get grossed out at the name because it really tastes more like a sweet jam rather than tomato. Whatever it is, it's amazing and I could eat them all day long! Another favorite of mine is the chicken salad.",

    "text": "So our new  beach cruiser biker gang stopped by after a nice 10 mile cruise on a gorgeous day.  We were lookin for some cool drinks and light snacks to refuel before the ride back.  We were promptly seated on the patio, so we could keep an eye on our sweet rides.  None of us thought to bring a lock... :(  rookies!!  We were quickly given some menus and waters.  And then... we waited.  I'd say about 3-4 minutes before someone came by to take our drink orders.  We should have just ordered food right away.  It took another couple minutes for some iced teas.  And another couple minutes to come back for the food orders.  We thought maybe we were just being grumpy hungry riders.  Then we looked around.  It seemed like the service was pretty slow throughout patio area.  There were quite a few filled tables, with what looked like 2 people handling them all.  But the 3 behind the bar looked like they had it good, just standing there chatting it up.  How about jumping over the bar and help out with the customers?   Some had the half paninis and half salad combos.  Others had the full paninis with the side salad.  For me, the full panini and basic side salad was the better value.  I think we will make the trek again, and give it another shot.  The food was good.  Though, the bruchetta looked awesome!  So we will have to try it!  We just hope the service steps it up a bit.",

This is a more, dare I say, European style of the Postinos own style and I totally buy it.   Postinos in general has grown out of its shell, and that might not necessary be a good thing. But if they keep progressing in this direction, I will keep supporting it. It has been said before - great location, big patio, sweet ambiance.   Postinos early weekday deals are awesome, and caters to the students that need something to eat before getting it on, and also to hard working people who just need an excuse to get out and break their diet early in the week. I thank Postinos for the increased chances in pursuing alcoholism, and also for a potential early onset diabetes.",

They are all fantastic.   I was extremely surprised/confused when after we received our Bruschetta the manager came up and apologized for the wait. It had maybe been 15-20 minutes... with the wine and lovely weather we hadn't even noticed. They offered to comp our WHOLE meal- drinks included. Extremely unnecessary but shows they pay attention to their customers. Really great/knowledgeable service. Will return soon! Thanks!",

Kitchen closed at 11 pm, but the restaurant was still open for another hour.  Well, that's helpful.    If you want to present a truly urban vibe, take a look at truly urban areas, where restaurants offer decent food (not Jimmy Johns) late in the evening, AFTER a show, for example.  Might as well live in Payson, for crying out loud!  I gave the place one star because it's attractive.",

There were quite a few different waiters that stopped to check on us. I had the chicken raspberry salad. It was incredible. My friend had the red pepper soup and panini. She said she liked her selections, especially the soup.  I would recommend this spot to anyone and I look forward to going there again... Except next time I'll make sure to go when I'm not working to have some wine! :)",

The venue itself was indeed gorgeous however our servers completely dropped the ball. We called and reserved a table for 15 people a day in advance to give them adequate time to accommodate. I would also like to disclaim that I work in the service industry so I'm not one to jump to conclusions, however over an hour just to receive our checks is NOT acceptable. Also we had multiple servers so it was extremely unclear who was \"taking care\" of our party. I've been to all the Postino locations and this was BY FAR the worst! Not worth wasting your time, if you have the option go to another location please do because they clearly don't know what they're doing here.",

The manager handled some knives afterwards. We were so disgusted we left without having anything else. This is so unsanitary.  We won't be back to this postino.",

Weekdays before 5pm wine glasses are only $5! The menu is very small. A few options of panini's that are more like sandwiches instead of an actual panini. I'm not very impressed with those. However; their salads are very good and the tomato soup has little pieces of pasta and it is very, very tasty! For bruschetta... There's probably 10 different creative options and they are each cut into 4 small pieces, so the board of bruschetta is great for sharing. My favorite is the artichoke spread! Usually a long wait. I wouldn't go here starving, but definitely hungry enough to munch of bruschetta with your wine! This location is walking distance to the bars on Mill Ave.",

It comes with a great side salad and enough turkey that I can only finish half. Unfortunately, the last time I ordered the turkey panini I felt like the kitchen skimped in the meat. Literally it looks like two very thick slices of focaccia and one slice of turkey. I asked the waiter if this is the \"New normal\" at this location and he told me that they measure it out in the back. He said he'd bring me extra turkey, which he never did but probably just got distracted so not a if deal.   However, I will say if this was my first time at Postino and I got this panini as my meal, I would probably not return. If I wanted focaccia I would've asked for just the bread.",

I will say it was a Monday night, so it was busy due to their board special. $20 for a bottle of wine and a board which is a great deal I'll say. The waitress took forever getting to us to place drinks in. She then forgot about us and some other waitress brought out bottle out. We ordered appetizers which were great. Then we had to track her down to put out food order in. She must have not put our food order in because our food never came out only for them to tell us it was never put in. Great food but TERRIBLE customer service. I would give them 0 for customer service if I could. Like I said great food but will most likely not be returning as my experience was the same as before.",

They are so utterly disorganized. I gave them my credit card to bill the entire table and they came back to me three times with different checks at different points during the evening - I had to explain to three different people that everything should go on that one card. How hard can that be ? The food took 50 min to arrive. One of my colleagues did not get her order and they wrap her stuff to go and kick us out  because they had another group reservation there.  In summary. Don't go there with big groups, the service it's complete chaos. A forgettable experience that I'm not planning to repeat.",

He was just the right amount of attentive throughout the meal, too - not a bunch of interruptions asking if everything was okay, but we could tell he was keeping an eye out and we never lacked water or adult beverages. My wife and I each had a salad and half sandwich - the one with Brie was fantastic but all the options looked good. We also split the bruschetta board - I wouldn't have considered it except for Michael's recommendation, and we were not disappointed. The wine and beer lists weren't overwhelmingly long, but they had the right based covered. I like their \"happy hour till 5\" idea, and we'd have stayed longer if we'd had the time. Two thumbs up!",

    "text": "No, no.... I am not dreaming.... Postino Tempe (Postino Annex) is NOW OPEN! Only a few minute walk from my front door now lays before me the miracle of $5 Wine (or pitchers of Beer) until 5pm and the best Bruschetta in town. I'm a HUGE fan - dating back to when there was just Postino Arcadia - and all I can say is that Tempe residents just got LUCKY!! Built in the historic Art Annex Building surrounded by all things Tempe. LOVE.  Bruschetta. Panini. Soup. Salad. Cheese board. Meat board. Olives. Awesome.  Bruschetta: Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios (sweet) and Salami with Pesto or Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato (savory) but you honestly can't go wrong with any of them! Don't pass up the Seasonal either, it's always a winner. Postino is best enjoyed eating/sharing items off the menu for several hours in good company. Italian Picnic? It's an amazing salad - and you'll feel like you're having one...  They are all about their wine, so you can't pick a wrong one. Feeling frisky? Let them recommend one based on your preference. I've done it before and been pleasantly surprised. I wasn't a fan of Bordeaux - but I tried one per their recommendation and ended up loving it. Prost!  Postino service is always top notch. They just get it. You won't find yourself with just one server, there are multiple of them checking in on you consistently and the service is always flawless. I never feel rushed. The food is consistent and timely. Always.  Tonight I had the pleasure of dining on the patio. The weather is just starting to cool off and the patio is lovely. Lush and green, cozy and sweet. Whether at Arcadia, Central, Gilbert or Tempe - there is a shared feeling amongst them all - the spaces are comfortable and I can always guarantee a fabulous evening and meal. The music is never too loud, it's the perfect place for good company and great conversations. Yes - I live in Tempe. No - I am not a college student and haven't been for a long time. I've matured - and now, apparently, Tempe has too!  Polish off perfection with a Salted Caramel Sundae and there is no way you can leave without a smile. If this is for some reason a dream, please don't wake me...",

When the muse has abandoned me like a mother duck inevitably leaves her duckling who falls down a storm grate? When my eyes feel like heavy leather and my fingers feel like metal even heavier than the water supply in Flint? When my neck creaks like a brachiosaurus getting off a trans-Atlantic flight in economy class? Why now, at this inopportune time?  Because I've applied to two Yelp Elite events and I want in, and I've been a busy work boy and a lazy Yelp boy and now I must pay my penance and write a review.  Why Postino? Because everyone and their poncy purebred Australian Shepard \"rescue\" has been to Postino. Everyone knows the $20 wine and board deal is the best thing that happened to their posh, foodie souls. Every woman over 25 has already been here with her friends at least ten times, because it's not sloppy drunk if you're in a wine bar nibbling on arugula and prosciutto and sipping your third bottle. And every dude knows there's nothing like a bottle of wine in a fancy wine bar to guarantee that she'll want a massage back home...  Everyone knows this already, and everyone already loves Postino. So I'm mailing this one in.  Just let me go to the event, please. I promise more effort next time, yelp gods.  Great for: Everyone and their dog. Bad for: no one, that's why I wrote this. It literally wrote itself.",

It is bright and airy, nice patio with beautiful long bar. We came for lunch and I had the split special,  1/2 prosciutto and fig sandwich with the beet salad. It was as mouthwatering as expected and not bad with a $9.95 price tag.   The menu is the same as all the other Postino's and they still do the $5 wines and beers till 5 and the awesome special $20 for a board and wine on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8. I wish they had this location 10 years ago when I went to ASU!",

It seems like it would be easy to make the items they sell here at home, but do I? No, I do not. I went with two other people and we shared many items. Bruschetta (of course), which is probably the best thing at postino, their soup of the day (which was a weird broth based potato soup...good, but not your typical soup), and the panini with bacon and chicken and magic sauce (ok ok not magic, but it seemed like it at the time)... This thing was so good. The best part? The leftovers were just as good as the original food. I'll be back.",

We decided to go to Postino Annex next door, and were seated right away. The entire staff members were very kind, helpful, and welcoming.   It was our first time at Postino, so our waiter was especially helpful by recommending the Vegetarian panini with chicken for my friend. She got the salad-panini combo, and I got the Farm Scramble. Although I haven't tried the vegetarian panini w/ chicken, my friend told me that it's very good. I tried some of her salad, and it was also tasty - I loved the walnuts, goat cheese, and dried fruits on top of the spinach and dressing. As for the farm scramble, it was also good - the eggs were scrambled with Yukon Gold potatoes and cheese, and came with a side salad and tomatoes. The salad and the tomatoes had some mystery dressing on it - I wish I knew their secret recipe so that I could have it more often.   I was really thirsty, so I was worried when the waiter came by with small glasses of water. However, I was very happy with the service because they kept refilling the glass. Our waiter checked in often (maybe even too often?), to see how we were doing. I'm giving the service a definite 5 - the staff made us feel like we were cared for.   I'll be back for some wine or mimosas. Recommended.",

    "text": "5 stars for food 1 star for service Avg: 3 stars  I stopped by this location with a large party for Saturday Brunch. We had called ahead with a reservation for our group (reservations are only for parties of 8 or more), and we were quickly seated. The service started out great with quick return with waters and menus. But, it quickly went downhill from there. I understand that it can be hard to take care of a large party with split checks, but with simple things like a cup of coffee (which came 20-30 minutes after ordering and a reminder to the server) it can be frustrating to wait a long time. I'm not sure if our server was in training or working as a trainer for someone else, but we had two servers both ignoring our table after the food was delivered. We had a couple issues with food being delivered to the wrong person (despite the separate tickets even). I think the topper was that it took about 20 mins to get the attention of the server to get the bills, and by this time everyone had been done eating and ready to go for about 30-40 minutes. It seemed like our server pair was waiting on about a third of the large inside space, so maybe there was a lack of servers on that day. Regardless, it was not a great experience.   As for the food, everyone was pleased with what they ordered, and the food quickly disappeared. I highly recommend the grilled foccacia (delicious and savory) and the cucumber honey lemonade (refreshing). I like that they have gluten free substitutes for each dish--which made our gluten-allergic friend super happy.   Overall, I think it would go back to Postinos for brunch, but I would probably try a different location next time.",

They offer $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer before 5pm as well as a $20 deal on Monday nights which includes a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta. They have a good menu with soups, sandwiches and salads, but they bruschetta is what you go here for! My favorites are prosciutto with fig, tomato jam, salmon with pesto and salami with pesto. I haven't tried a board I don't like ($14.50) so definitely mix it up! I'd recommend you add their email list for coupons and birthday gifts.",

You're greeted by amazing servers EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Upward Projects does an amazing job at hiring the best servers that are not only enjoyable your first time, but your second and third and fourth, because they remember your name and become your friend. Evan, Julia, Anna and the rest of the gang are such a delight every time I go, I always feel like they're welcoming me home. Their Monday and Tuesday night deals are no secret so make sure you get there early (and possibly with a small party). They have wine for every pallet and their bruschetta is to die for. Personal favorites? Tomato Jam & Sheep's Milk Cheese, Pistachio, Date & Ricotta, and White Bean & Chopped Tomato. Something I've learned is to get the stronger tasting ones at night time and the sweeter tasting ones during the day. So no roasted red pepper and goat cheese (though drool-worthy) during the day for you! Their Argentinian white wine is perfect for newbies who just turned 21, and if you don't finish the bottle they cork it for ya and you can take it home! Also, make sure you sign up for their eposse on their website! Free entree for your next visit, and a guaranteed reservation & free dessert for your birthday! To top it all off, their music playlists are ALWAYS on point. Every. single. time. Postino Annex (and all Upward Projects restaurants for that matter) exude excellence and consistency - the dining experience absolutely cannot get better than this! *~lUv y@, P0$t!n0~*",

When we finally got seated, the server took forever to take our orders and never came back to check on us until we were almost done with our food. When he came back at the end of the meal and asked if we wanted dessert, nobody said yes so he left again and never got our checks. After waiting another 20 minutes, a different server brought our checks with half of them being wrong. Him and the original server took turns bringing the checks and cards back for us to sign.

The restaurant still have a lot of seat  The restaurant is very clean and the service is very good and fast. The location of this restaurant is very convenient for me, I park my bike under the university house and walk here in 2 minutes. I think the gluten free food and the low price attract a lot of people here. It is very hard to find a restaurant that have gluten free food in ASU campus.  I had a great experience in this restaurant. They have a lot of options to order, so I can choose my favorite dishes. I had a pick of 2 option to try both their soups and a half of panini. The special soup for that day is chicken cream soup, I think the taste of the soup is warm and amazing. I ordered a roasted beef panini, but I think the panini is very dry and taste a little bit salty. That is why I rate them 4.0. The overall experience in this restaurant is very amazing. I think it is worth it and I only paid 11.35 without the tip. I think this place is very good for 4-5 people dinning together and I recommend it. I think I will come to this restaurant next time because the experience is really good.",

I went in for an early lunch, so there were only a handful of customers. After I was promptly led to a table, I was told the server would be right with me to take my order. Although the place was fully-staffed, they appeared to ignore the customers. I noticed the the table ahead of me commented that nobody was coming by to take their order either. I waited 10 minutes and even though staff kept walking by, nobody made eye contact or offered to take my order. Finally, as I packed up to leave, somebody asked me if I wanted a drink. Ugh! Seriously, if the staff outnumber the customers, couldn't somebody figure out how to take an order? I've been there during peak rush and have gotten faster and friendlier service. I'll be back, but I guess it's better to go when they're really busy.",

We almost always get the warm artichoke, spicy pepper jam, pistachio and date, and salmon bruschettas. But the few times we've ventured beyond that, we have never been disappointed. It's a great place!",

We were immediately greeted and sat outside where we could enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring. The menu presented a few lunch and brunch choices, all of which seemed great. I ordered a bellini and the fruit and yogurt.   All was fantastic. The service was great and we were checked on constantly by more than just our waitress. Not sure why the place was lacking customers!",

They texted us that our table was ready so we headed back over. The restaurant is beautiful. It's got a casual but classy vibe. I love the indoor/outdoor bar and the patio was really nice but we opted to stay inside. I wish I could remember our servers name because he was great. He helped us decide on a bottle of cabernet, the ones he showed us ranged from $75-101 so I'm not sure what the cheaper options are because they don't put the bottle prices on the menu. The wine was amazing and the cheese board and bruschetta boards are priced very fairly at $15 for what you get. It all tasted wonderful and I can't wait for the chance to come back here!",

As a result, no request is too small, and water glasses were full the whole time.  2.  Food.  They totally adapted to my lactose free requests.  I had the most delicious light breakfast of nicely seasoned egg whites, sauteed a la dente asparagus, and toasted focaccia.  Magnifique!  3.  Location.  Beautiful outdoor seating in heart of ASU.  Also, the wait at Squeeze next door was 60 minutes.  No wait here!  4.  Price. My aforementioned focaccia sandwich was only $9!",

From the moment we met him we loved him. We knew a few of the things we wanted on the menu, but asked for a few recommendations to go with our bruschetta board. From the Crispy Cauliflower, to the spicy soup (of the day), to the Brussel Sprouts Salad, and the fact that they had my favorite bruschetta tonight (as a seasonal special): Tomato Jam & Sheep Cheese, Bruno's recommendations did NOT disappoint. He also recommended a bottle - The Fableist, a Merlot from Paso - that was an excellent accompaniment to the food choices we made. (I am not typically a 'Merlot' girl, but I *DO* LOVE Paso wines!) And then he brought us out a dessert that was incredible -- Chocolate Bouchon. Truly, from the moment we walked in, we had a magically inviting and wonderfully delicious experience. Thanks for your passion for good food, great wine, and lovely service, Bruno!!! We'll definitely come back to visit!",

They do a wonderful job of revamping old buildings (not that many left in town know for treating down anything old) and turning them into interesting, relaxed restaurants. This place used to be an Art Annex for ASU. Thus the Postino Annex name. I come here mostly on the exceptionally priced, bottle and board special nights. This location has less couples on dates those nights compared to other Postino's locations and instead is filled with a larger percentage of coeds on girls having wine night out with friends. The patio is my favorite place to sit and looks out at the growing skyscrapers in the area around the ASU football stadium. The line can get long, so get there right when the special kicks in.",

I have never been to a place which has a collection of bruschetta one better than the other. My favorite was the fig and green apple one and then we had a big argument for the second position which was split between the salmon and the artichoke one.

I came here with 2 friends/work colleagues. It was a great space to talk and catch up as it was not too loud.   We shared a butcher's board and a bruschetta plate. We really liked that you get to customize your bruschetta plate with 4 different toppings. The four we had were (1) traditional tomato-basil-mozzarella (2) fig-apple-brie (3) smoked salmon with capers (4) red pepper jelly. All 4 were so good we ended up ordering a second set! #3 was my favorite, #2 was one of my colleague's favorite.  For dessert, we split a creme brulee. It is a good size, easy for one person to finish but large enough to share. It comes out with fresh strawberries on the side.  I would come back here again in a heartbeat-- so good!",

You can't go wrong with a board of delicious bruschetta or a panini/salad combo. My go to bruschetta board normally consists of 2 pieces of the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, 1 warm artichoke spread, and 1 smoked salmon with pesto.   On Monday and Tuesday nights starting at 8PM they have a bottle and board deal, which is where you get a bottle of wine and a board of 4 pieces of bruschetta for $20. It doesn't get much better than that for girls night or date night.   And lets not forget their brunch on Saturday's and Sunday's, which is my Mom's favorite spot. Some favorite entrees of ours are the Morning Staple, Grilled Focaccia, or Ciabatta French Toast. I also suggest it's not a bad idea to have a little desert with your breakfast, and try a refreshing peach bellini. (:   The outdoor patio and atmosphere tops just about any restaurant in the area. Enjoy!",

In the past year I've rediscovered it, and have been to all 4 AZ locations in that time (including this one twice).  I love all Postino's. The food is delicious & consistent, and the service is always friendly. Depending on when you go they can all get pretty crowded. In the two times I've been to this location (both midweek...once for lunch & once for dinner) I was surprised by the crowd. Despite the fact that it's right smack in the middle of ASU's campus I didn't get a real college-y vibe. Granted, Postino doesn't seem like a typical restaurant you'd find on a college campus.   The one thing I don't like about this location is the parking situation. Since it is right on ASU's campus parking is scarce & it's metered everywhere.   As far as food/drink, like I said, it's your typical yummy Postino. You can never go wrong with a bruschetta board (I think by this point I've tried them all, and I can't think of single one I don't like). The sandwiched are all delicious as well. Also the $5 glass of wine deal until 5 o'clock every day is great.",

I finally had the chance to try it out this week and was not disappointed!   It was less expensive than the hip artsy vibe suggests, and there are lots of special deals that make for a budget friendly outing.   I got the vegetarian panini and soup of the day (a creamy, cheesy tomato variety) and was very happy with both choices. Next time I'll have to get the bruschetta boards because those looked amazing.   The service was fast and friendly and the overall vibe made for a really special and Instagram-worthy brunch excursion. Maybe not the place for kids or cheap eating, but just right for date night or girls outing!",

We split a meat board and a board with four bruchetta.  There was plenty of food and each of the bruchetta was different so there was quite a variety of flavors.  The service was less than outstanding, but all in all I enjoyed it and plan to go back.",

It is fairly expensive and I do not think the paninis or salads are worth the price. Good atmosphere and location. Service is average - waiters are very friendly but usually I have to wait a while for someone to come to my table. Overall, a good place but not somewhere I would go all the time.",

    "text": "i LOVE this place!  we were in arizona for a wedding and i was seriously tempted to eat here every day that weekend.  it was that good!  to be honest, i did end up eating here right before the wedding, i couldn't help it =P  so this place is located on ASU campus.  we came here and it was easy to find meter parking on the street.  it was only $1.50 an hour with a 2 hour max.  if you come here during happy hour (open until 5 PM), you can get any glass of wine for $5, or any pitcher of beer (a little over two glasses) for $5.  what a great deal!  i was able to try several glasses of wine, but the riesling was my favorite.    i came here for one reason, and one reason only... the gluten free bruschetta!  it's a $2 surcharge to have it on gluten free bread, but well worth it.  the bread was amazing and had such good texture, you wouldn't be able to tell that it was gluten free.  i asked what brand the bread was, since i wanted to buy some once i got home, and it turns out they buy it from a local bakery called \"gluten free creations bakery.\"  high five to the bakery for making such fantastic bread, and high five to postino for buying locally instead of doing Udi's brand.  i was able to get several sets of bruschetta with a variety of toppings.  here are my favorite listed in order:  1. smoked salmon with pesto - it had capers and red onions also, and was a delightful combination.  the pesto really brightened up the flavor and it was really yummy.  2. burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato - i learned that burrata is a type of cheese.  it's a pretty good choice, how can you go wrong with bacon and cheese?  3. salami with pesto - yum yum yum!  salami was good and pesto was delicious!  4. warm artichoke spread - tasted like an artichoke dip, but less creamy.   5. prosciutto with figs & mascarpone - i love prosciutto, but this flavor combination didn't work well.  it was just way too sweet.    6. brie & apples with fig spread - also pretty sweet, but good  7. roasted peppers with goat cheese - i am a cheese lover.  i eat cheese for dessert.  i eat cheese for breakfast.  i will eat cheese at any time!  however, i was disappointed in this one.  you couldn't really taste the goat cheese and the roasted peppers were bland.  the restaurant is really pretty with a variety of seats.  you can sit inside at the bar, or on the outside at the bar (on patio), or booths inside.  there are several tables on the patio with shade from umbrellas and trees.  they even have couches you can lounge on inside!  great for study groups i would imagine.  the only negative thing i can mention is the bathroom.  it's actually outside the restaurant and reminded me of public bathrooms at the park.  it's nice once you're inside, but i can't get over feeling like i'm at a public park.  the service is what makes this place a solid 5 star.  we always had excellent service.  they do a team effort approach here so you won't only see your server helping you out, but probably 4-5 additional people.  we would just turn around to look for our server, and instantly someone else would come help us.  really top notch service and such friendly people!  if we ever go back to arizona, this will be my first stop.    get the bruschetta - you won't be disappointed.  enjoy it on the patio with wine and beer while people watching!",

Loud lively music ranging from today's top hits to 90's rap which I enjoyed. Was greeted quickly and given ice water and a menu. After I ordered my food and first drink unfortunately I was forgotten. I had to ask for ice water refill, second drink and extra toasts for my butcher block appetizer even though I was sitting in front of the bartender. Although wine list boasts \"best wine selection in the world\" in my opinion It was not. Included were trendy new wines which are popular with the naive college crowds (Malbec, how novel!). The butcher block appetizer was presented very nicely and had a perfect mix of salty and sweet as well as textures. Would've given 4 stars if service was more attentive and wine list was better.",

Food: 3.5, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3.5 ($10 for panini or half panini and salad) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Wine list: eclectic where I didn't recognize one on the long list. Like the $5 until 5 deal. I wasn't even feeling like having wine with lunch and I was lured into it. (I'm not a hard sell).  - Sunshine salad: different veggies plus bacon and cashews. 3.5 stars. - Turkey pesto sandwich: fresh and liked the crunchy ciabatta bread. 3.5 stars. - Bruchetta: had a bunch of options that looked good and could pick 4. I'll try that next time.  - Gluten free friendly: had GF bread options as a substitute - Patio: nice area to enjoy the Arizona sunshine  - Cool logo: peace, love, wine, and music. What else do you need in life?  Lowlights: - Potato chips: the hub thought they were overlooked and weren't so crispy   I'd come back in a wine mode and hang out in the sun for a while with my Sundevil niece.",

    "text": "Postino's is the move for two reasons.... Value and Trend 1.) Value... Postino's is obviously a very popular place because they are doing their deals right! Monday and Tuesday nights are bottle and board for $20? YES! Anyone would agree to that. Often times I split it with a friend and and it's enough food for me! When you think about it, splitting a board is still about 2 full pieces of bread with toppings... like a sand which! So we eat and get about 2.5 glasses each if we share a bottle.... DEAL!  2.)Trend- I live right next to Postino's and I always admire the ambiance... everyday the servers are dressed so beautifully and trendy, it makes it so inviting. The lights make it cozy and the set up and design is just really homey and well done... like catching up with friends in someone's backyard patio!  best part of college is POSTINOS!!!:)",

It landed in my hummus. Surprise!  3. The kitchen failed to add Parmesan to the bounty (this is a standard part of the meal).   Does the kitchen even look at the food they're putting out?  I'm a regular customer at the Arcadia postino and I visit postino annex every few weeks. There is a difference in quality between what the two kitchens produce.   Other notes  1. The order was delayed and delayed by Postino Annex (ultimately about 45m) in mid afternoon.  2. The order was cold when it arrived. I watched the driver on his route so it likely wasn't a result of delivery issues.",

    "text": "A huge Upwards Projects fan, I feel like I find myself at their restaurants pretty often. I always forget that there's a Postino close to me, which is probably for the best (for my wallet), but we came here on a Tuesday night. Obviously, the $20 board and bottle deal is the slammin'est deal in the valley.   I'm also a big fan of red wine, and they have a great selection. My personal favorites are the Stagedive Pinot Noir and Espiritu Malbec, but honestly you can't go that wrong with any of them--especially during this deal. Samesies with the bruschetta--I've never had one that I disliked. Personal top ones though: brie and apple, burrata and bacon, tomato jam and sheeps milk (they unfortunately removed this from the permanent menu, but bring it back seasonally!).   The most recent time we visited, our order wasn't put into the kitchen, so we waited about 45 minutes before our server came back to explain. Honestly, we kind of noticed it was taking a while, but weren't really bothered by it because it was a super busy night. She apologized profusely many times over, despite our assurances that it wasn't a big deal, and they ended up comping one of our board and bottles, as well as tossing a handful of free desserts our way. The salted caramel sundae was excellent. Like I said, we didn't even have much of an issue with it to begin with, but it's always super appreciated when a restaurant will go out of their way to make sure their patrons are happy.",

    "text": "Some girlfriends and I met for a little lunch date and we have been to this restaurant before in a different location so it seemed right to have a drink and some lunch. We had 5 people at the table - with some showing up later than others and the square table we had was a little small.  By the time we ordered food and had drinks it was really compact and little awkward and we noticed some tables around us that didn't have people in them.  We were catching vibes from the service people when we got there but we asked if it would be possible to put a few tables together since our group got bigger and she told us that she would ask but that there was a waitlist and other tables were reserved.  So she came back a few minutes later with drinks for us and said that we would not be able to push the tables together.  We said okay and just sucked it up.  So the seats that supposed had a waitlist stayed empty for a good 20 minutes before someone sat down there.  Once the food came there was really no room on the table and two ladies had brought the food for the table.  I asked if they could take the waters off the table because we don't have room and she did it (with an attitude).  She kind of huffed but removed the water and we had a little more room. The food itself was pretty good.  It did seem to take a while to get the food but when we got to eat it was good.  I had a chicken panini with mozzarella and it tasted like a spicy mayo dressing.  It was a good kick and take to the sandwich.  My friends got similar takes on their lunch with a tuna panini, a veggie panini and one of the salami boards they offer.  The homemade chips are also a cool treat and nice touch to the meal. The service in general wasn't great and a lot of the women that were serving us seemed to have a bit of an attitude.  That kind of seemed like the vibe the entire time we lunched there.  I don't think we will go back to that location but spending time with the ladies is always nice.",

    "text": "I love this Postino's location in Tempe. The outdoor patio is absolutely beautiful and spacious.   Specials:  I came here on a Monday for the the Monday & Tuesday special of $20 for a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine with 3 of my friends.   Wait:  There was a long wait of about 40 minutes when we came around 8 p.m. (when the special stars), but we are always willing to wait for that special deal!  Interior:  My party of four and I sat at a table inside. We were surrounded by other booths and tables as well as beautiful wall decor. A wall to the left of us by the bathrooms had scattered mirrors and a sitting area with couches with people sipping on their wine. Towards the opposite end of the room was where the bar was where you can also have food + drinks.  Service: Monday night was a bit busy at Postino's, so wine took a little longer to come out as well as glasses of water, but as soon as our waiter came to take our order, we were constantly being checked up on, so we were happy.   Food:  *$20 Bruschetta Board & Wine* I don't think you can get any better than Postino's $20 bruschetta board and a bottle of wine. It's perfect for even-numbered groups so two people can share a board and a bottle. For the bruschetta, you can mix and match 4 different types to form your board. A few of my favorites are the ricotta with dates and pistachio, the warm artichoke spread, and the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone. I usually get the Cabernet Sauvignon for wine or the Rose.  I highly recommend this place, especially for a first date. Your date will be impressed, but little will he/she know that you only spent $20...get some more food on top of the board and wine and she'll be like holy cow ;)",

    "text": "BACKGROUND  I first noticed Postino Annex when I stopped by Snooze An AM Eatery.  Every time I was in the area, Postino Annex was always busy and always looked inviting. I JUST HAD TO STOP IN.  The first time I went in, I was wildly IMPRESSED!   The staff was CHARMING; just the right amount of friendliness mixed with professionalism.  As I've said MANY times, the way the staff behaves is 100% indicative of the management, and the management is CLEARLY on top of the game.  Speaking of GREAT MANAGEMENT, as I said in my recent review of Postino Highland, owners, the DeMarco's and the Bailey's, the parent corporation, LGO Hospitality (which owns the following Phoenix Restaurants, including, La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria, Chelsea's Kitchen, Ingo's Tasty Food, Buck & Rider, Grateful Spoon Gelato and LGO Bake Shop. In California they own The Misfit, La Grande Orange Cafe, Ingo's Tasty Diner and The Luggage Room Pizzeria), are killing it, and I'm a fan!  POSTINO ANNEX  In September, 2014, the fourth and largest location of Postino Wine Cafe opened its doors to the public. Dubbed Postino Annex, the new restaurant and wine bar is located inside the historic Art Annex building at 615 S. College Avenue, just steps from the heart of the Arizona State University campus.  The 4,200 square-foot restaurant and wine bar is the largest of the Postino locations to date. But for Upward Projects' owners, Craig and Kris DeMarco and Lauren and Wyatt Bailey, this newest location is about more than just reinvigorating another historical building. All four partners are ASU alumni and Lauren Bailey, who studied art, used to work in the former Art Annex when she was in school.  In terms of the design, Postino Annex can be thought of a sort of \"Postino 2.0,\" Bailey says. Though they tried to incorporate elements that will be familiar to Postino fans, the owners also wanted give a different type of experience, one more tailored to the blossoming Tempe neighborhood.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   My most recent visit was exceptional, as always.  What do I mean by \"exceptional?\"  Well, it's a neighborhood college campus bar, so I'm definitely not talking about 5 Star Fine Dining. I'm talking about cute and casual good food with friendly great service.  I like that everyone is treated well and the food is always superb, at least that's what I've noticed.  I love their draft beer selections. I also love how knowledgeable the staff is about their selections. I like a certain type of beer.   For example, although I enjoy heavy IPA's from time to time, I'm not able to drink more than one. That's where a knowledgeable staff comes into play. They've researched their selection, offer appropriate suggestions, and give samples. I enjoy picking their bartender's brains to hear the latest and greatest.  Of course, I had to have one of their famous bruschetta boards before leaving. Always DELICIOUS!  CONCLUSION  I love it here, and what's not to love?    Every visit I've had at Postino Annex has been 100%.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Patio is delightful at the right time of year.  *The restroom is shared with Snooze An AM Eatery.  *Parking is a bitch. Good luck.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpostinowinecafe.com&s=92c5ce7e03f3d30eaab863c5a91586bfb95affce76d889a0cb678b070f08bc42\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">postinowinecafe.com</a>",

I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night and we got super expensive glasses of wine because it was after 5 so no happy hour. The bruschetta was hella expensive and pretty mediocre for what we paid for, and I left with my stomach still grumbling. After paying and trudging out of the restaurant I was shocked to see a bunch of freshly 21 year olds lined up outside with full on fancy restaurant-wear?! What is happening? I know this place is always busy, but for what?? It also sucks that you have to pay ASU to park and it came out to $9 for 2 hours. Come on guys, not even validation? Finally, word to the wise, ask for the \"bottle and board\" deal before you order, they'll try to play games with you after you already ordered your super expensive glass and app. The bottle and board together is $20 and not advertised anywhere until you completely cleaned your plate and glass... Pretty nice ambiance, and good service, but I could have survived without trying this place.",

The atmosphere is also great for the perfect date night.   My favorite would be the salmon, prosciutto, brie, and pistachio bruschetta. They carry an exclusive zinfandel here and it's always a treat!  Service here is always friendly and promtp. Last time I dined in the kitchen accidentally got one of our bruschetta wrong. We didn't mind the mistake, since it was delicious always, but the waiter went out of his way to fix the problem by gabbing us what we originally wanted.",

And they have very decent beer on tap, many different styles to choose from, and the food...oh my the food.  We did the bruschetta board as I'm sure most people do.  My personal opinion is that anyone who eats food needs to put Postino on their list.  Gluten Free? Postino has you covered.  Even their website is really cool!    Service was awesome.  Restaurant cleanliness top notch. Atmosphere superb.  It's a good thing I don't live too close, or I'd be here far more often than I should, and wouldn't see my family as much.  I still can't get over $5 pitchers of beer.  You do realize that the beers they offer in a pitcher would be at least $5 for a pint at many other places?  Unreal.",

Every staff member is beyond friendly, helpful and genuinely caring in regards to guest experience. What I find myself most impressed by is the team work between the servers! They all help each other run food, and refill drinks and they do this with a smile and they seem extremely willing to be a support system for each other, I LOVE IT!  I want to take a second to comment on the bar tender from last night ANDY!!   The place was absolutely packed, we were quoted an hour and 15 minutes before we would be sat, my friend and I were standing near the bar waiting to be called, when Andy (whom by the way was beyond busy behind the bar) approached us to get us started on our wine bottle and offered to have the bottle transferred to our table once we are called (meaning he would not receive a tip for this gesture, he served us the wine just to be helpful and kind!). I noticed him constantly checking to make sure we were taken care of and happy as we waited for our table, I also noticed all smiles and laughs from the customers at his bar rail who seemed to love Andy just as much as we did. About 25 minutes later (just our luck) a spot cleared at Andy's rail before we were called for a table so we ended up being able to sit with Andy at the bar! YAY! He made our experience incredible, Suggested I try the salmon and pesto bruschetta, which is now my personally favorite! And made my friend and I laugh and have an awesome dinner!   ANDY IS AWESOME!!",

    "text": "Postino Annex showed up when searching for Italian restaurants in the area, and because of all these great reviews I thought let's give it a shot. First off, this is NOT Italian food. It's basically just a glorified sandwich place. The interior is indeed extremely nice and classy. Wine racks, custom ceiling decorations, all that stuff. It has a pretty and sophisticated feel that's actually a nice change from the rest of this area in Tempe.  The food is weird though. There are no \"real\" hot foods. No pizza, no pasta, no meat dishes. All they have are paninis, bruschetta, and plates of cheeses and meats. That's it. (and lots of wines and cocktails) Everything they serve is stuff you can pick up at the grocery store and put together yourself. Most of what they offer doesn't require any special seasoning or cooking or really anything that requires a skilled cook. Open jar or package, cut into pieces, put on thick wood plate to give it substance - boom, snack dressed up as dinner.   The quality of the food itself seemed high.   Our meat/cheese plate had a good amount of fresh olives, various cheeses, and a couple of slices of what seemed to be good quality salami and prosciutto. I'd compare it to the stuff you'd grab at Whole Foods.   The bruschetta was decent but again nothing to write home about. Slices of white bread with your choice of 6 different toppings. We chose the salmon (good), artichoke (meh) and something else that I don't recall. I remember it had a pesto smear. Decent but not really anything we would consider an Italian dinner.   Service was friendly enough, although our server enjoyed chatting with her friends more than actually serving anyone at a decent speed.  Table was a bit cramped. Overall nothing terrible or awesome. The food just was a let down. I always feel taken advantage of when a place just has sandwiches and stuff I could make myself in 2 minutes with basic items I can buy at the grocery store. No cooking, no seasoning required.   If all you want are paninis or bruschetta, and are more interested in wine or cocktails, this place is probably great. But if you're looking for actual food that satisfies a big appetite, look elsewhere.",

We saw our server three times in the hour we were there (once was when we asked for the check), and if we hadn't grabbed her to order when we did I'm not sure we ever would have had the chance! Granted, they had a private party that night which I'm guessing kept them pretty busy. We ordered the meat and cheese board and the caprese salad. The caprese was nice and the flavored well-balanced, and the dish was pleasantly composed. However, the meat and cheese board had about two pieces of cheese and, inexplicably, an enormous glob of hummus in the middle. What was I to eat that with? Crostini? Pickles? Unclear. The meats and pickles were nice but everything else left much to be desired. I'd skip the apps and go for something heftier next time. We left oddly full off two appetizers, but not in a good way. Like, in a bloaty I-just-ate-a-glob-of-hummus-at-a-wine-bar sort of way. Womp womp. We'll probably give it another shot due to the nice patio and the very cheap wine list.",

    "text": "I love this new Tempe Postino space!  I'm a huge Postino Arcadia fan, so when my husband suggested we head to this new location for a little lunch date last week, I was all about it.    They did a great job on the space itself; it's warm and cozy despite being much larger in square footage compared to the Phoenix locations.  The staff was super friendly as well.  The menu is the same, and despite the Bella Postino (hummus and artichoke spread) appetizer tasting a little off, everything else we had was delicious.  That being said, our waitress brought us a second artichoke spread that was warmer and less watery after our giving her a heads-up about the first round.  I highly recommend the bruschetta to share (with your fave glass of wine of course).  You can't really make a wrong selection here, but my favorite selections are: *Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone *Brie & Apples with Fig Spread *Salami with Pesto *Smoked Salmon with Pesto (in that order)  Their seasonal selections are usually worth giving a shot as well.  And if you prefer a salad or sandwich, you won't be disappointed with that.  This Postino is definitely a welcome addition to the Tempe area... and they cater too!",

The wait staff was always exceptionally friendly and professional. We did not recognize anyone anymore... All new people and service left a lot to be desired.... It is really sad as it has been one of our most favorite places....",

    "text": "It's no secret that I'm a big fan of Postino. I started eating at the Arcadia location 12 years ago, and I've been the duchess of Gilbert pretty much since it opened. Even though Postino is part of my weekly routine, I was still excited to check out Annex before a show at Gammage.   As expected of any Upward Projects restaurant, the interior and exterior are impeccable. I really loved sitting outside with a gorgeous view of A mountain. I also like the vibe of this Postino better than Gilbert. Very few children around. On the East side, you'll see infant carriers and strollers well into the night.  I'm happy to see they brought back a Furmint for the summer. Very delicious if you like sweeter whites, and it was only $24 which is just $4 more than happy hour prices. I had a few bites of my friend's Hannah's field salad which was great.  It was a very short and lovely walk through campus to get to Gammage, so I'm sure I'll be making Postino my preshow dinner choice quite often.",

I am guessing that because it was at night and during the winter break, parking was not an an issue. Might be during the school season, although there are garages near by.   We had the bruschetta for starters. I recommend all of them! I am an Arnold Palmer kind of girl and my friend loves the cucumber honey.  She had the soup of the day (cheddar and potatoes - don't remember the exact name) and thought it was pretty good. Definitely a creamy soup. We both had the chicken and mozzarella and it was delicious. I'm a cheese lover so I loved that it comes with a pretty thick slice of mozzarella. I had Hannah's Field salad and I thought it was pretty flavorful, I would definitely have it again.",

They are more the weak, pale brother who does well in math. The chicken salad lacked the right balance, the pieces of apple were huge, very little gorgonzola. The sandwiches seemed to lack the right amount of meat. And part of the sandwich had none at all, just a corner of bread...and when your splitting that results in feeling cheated!

Normally if a place has a strong food presence with meh service I'll do a three star but the service here was just terrible.  It took over 30 minutes just to get our waiter to take our order, we constantly had to ask for water, our beer never came so we finally just cancelled it.  The kids food came out at the same time as the entrees even though we requested that come out first, AND we had to walk to hand our bill to our waiter to pay after he walked by us multiple times without taking it (between 5-10min).  The best thing to eat was definitely the bruschetta but I personally still prefer la bocca to here for that.  The only thing better about the bruschetta here was the bread wasn't hard which I like.  My panini was a little bland and the chicken was a little dry, but the Brussel sprout salad was delightful.  Very light and full of summery flavors. Again, overall the food was decent but the service will definitely keep me from going back.",

Above all what I like best about the many great things about all of the Postino's restaurants is the hospitality!!!  Last week I popped into The Postino on College Ave for a cold $5 small pitcher of beer, what an amazing price for any of the great beers on tap. Service was swift and friendly and my 30 minute visit was very enjoyable.  It was so enjoyable That when I was given a choice for my birthday gathering of friends This location was my only choice.  Birthday night was grand, and everything we ordered was delicious! The Pub Board was loaded with awesome cheeses salami, humus and other tasty items it's 15 bucks but well worth every penny. Several bottles of wine and fantastic boards of Bruschetta were also shared amongst us friends and as usual they were interesting and tasty.   Service was stellar, and ever present, but never intrusive. AJ, The General Manager even stopped by with birthday greetings while busy orchestrating one of the best run and busiest restaurants in town.",

While they have a couple of locations around the valley, I've found this one to be my favorite for a variety of reasons.   The ambiance is great for a small intimate group or a large group of friends. They have indoor and outdoor seating that is modern and stylish, allowing you feel as if you are at home whole dining.   The customer service is top notch. Everyone is incredibly nice and you'll always feel like you're being taken care of.   The food. The food, oh my, best part about it. My regular is a bruschetta board, which you can customize to your heart's desire. Each bruschetta board comes with four choices. I love love love the ricotta with dates and pistachios and the almond hummus with chopped tomato. Those are my two staple choices and I usually rotate the other two. Pro tip: add some pesto if you get the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil. It elevates it tremendously.   While this place can be on the pricier side, the food is made to order and you can taste the freshness. They create the coolest flavor combinations. Definitely recommend.",

The water server placed our glasses down, first noted and only complaint the glasses were dirty with lipstick and dirty fingerprints. when brought to the attention of our fantastic server, Cameron, it was immediately taken car of and he was very apologetic.  Happy Hour (11:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.) pitchers of beer for $5 is an excellent deal! Hands down the BEST Bruschetta Board, trust me I've had a lot of bruschetta from other restaurants. I've had all the combinations and all excellent. I also split a Panini: Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise) which comes with homemade chips. All the food was very good, fresh and tasty.  My only suggestion to the owners, having been regulars for a while but stopped because the menu items/choices never change, maybe a daily special of at least 1 or 2 added combination of bruschetta would be nice.   Atmosphere, food and service (thanks Cameron) all made an enjoyable Lunch!",

That's a big disappointment for me at a wine bar with a fun, lively patio. There's nothing better than a fruity sangria on a warm day. I get that they don't have a full bar, but I'm totally okay with a liquor-less sangria. I was also disappointed with the prosciutto panini. The flavor was there, but the prosciutto was tough to bite through and large pieces would come out of the sandwich as I tried to tear off a bite. Not sure what's up with that. Between that and the lack of sangria, I give this place 3.5, but I'll round up to 4 because I would like to go back and try the delicious looking bruschetta flight.",

We waited and sat inside, but about five minutes after we were seated, they opened the door to the outside (because they were serving people out there) and LEFT it open the whole time. After all of that waiting for an indoor seat, we still spent the lunch huddled in buttoned-up coats shivering.  This place is only nice when the weather is nice.

We had to chase down hot sauce, and actually walk over to the bar to gain attention. As mentioned earlier, we were one of only a few tables with guests, but once they saw I had an empty plate they tried to rush us by removing the plate and putting pressure on my companion to finish. This would be understandable if the restaurant was packed and they want to increase table turnover, but not when there is hardly anyone there. This place has great potential, but the staff needs training.",

This was our second choice after being completely ignored by the staff at postinos, which is apparently is so hipster/civil war reenactor, that they don't need to make money.   If we want to go to postinos, we'll make sure to wear our skinny jeans and guy-liner.  Prob get VIP.",

She not only has my name but she was so sweet about making sure my friends and I got a table even though it was very busy- she made me feel special. Then we ordered the bruschetta- can't complain! So yummy! All of it! We got a bottle of wine- the server had me taste it before he poured it and that was nice. We ordered the chocolate dessert- yum!!! Okay so I did order the soup, I think it was Italian sausage ? This was not so good. Idk but it wasn't bad but it wasn't at a level to be on the menu, it tasted like I could go get a can on chef boyardee from a gas station and pour it in a fancy bowl. Anyway overall I will be back and we are all very impressed with the service and the food!",

Their $20 bruschetta and wine bottle deals are amazing, definitely check that out on Monday and Tuesday nights after 8pm.  Their Stagedive Pinot Noir is such a delicious wine and you can only get it there, so I stock up on those nights :)  Always clean, super friendly and fast wait staff, great decor, great outdoor and indoor seating options, child-friendly.  Sometimes the music is a bit loud but I'm an old grandma at heart so that might just be me.  The cucumber lemonade is particularly good, give that a try on a hot day.  Their brunch is also great.",

Like others have said, it definitely has a different vibe than the other locations. That's to be expected, and trying to cram a trendy & upscale winebar next door to a Subway and Panda Express wouldn't have succeeded so I'm glad to see that they are embracing the college town atmosphere.  You can expect the same stuff that any other Postino has: an eclectic array of bruschetta, a wide variety of alcohol, and decent daily specials. Would I make this an absolute go to for dinner dates? Maybe, but I'd much rather go to the other locations for that. Where the \"Annex\" succeeds is being an awesome lunch spot. $5 pitchers from 11am-5pm? Yes, please. The bruschetta plates can be split between two people for a not-too-filling lunch, so enjoy the Annex for what it is: a great place to mix it up for lunchtime, and a decent place for dinner.",

I received a text saying my table was ready after waiting 25 minutes, so I went to the front counter to wait behind these two other people who were taken to a table before us who didn't even have their name down on the wait list. One of the hostesses (Katie) sat them at our table and then when I told them my name they looked at their tablets confused and said it will be a few more minutes to clean off another table. 10 minutes later I asked how much longer and they gave me an excuse explanation how it takes awhile to process the tab and clean the table. We were finally sat 15 minutes after being called already. You could imagine the frustration especially since the wait is enough in itself for the deal. The only thing that made our night better was the manager coming to our table to apologize for the mix up with the tables. Thank you again but I really do believe the hostesses need help with their customer service, because it put a damper on our whole night.",

While I wasn't blown away by the service -- our server was definitely NOT effusive -- I thoroughly enjoyed my bruschetta board and wine.  For our bruschetta options, my other half and I selected the brie and apple (SO GOOD), tomato/mozza/basil, roasted artichoke, and roasted tomato and goat cheese.  All were lovely and large enough to satiate both of our appetites.  We arrived just after happy hour ended (next time, we will be on time for HH) and noticed it wasn't too crowded.

Today--the whole experience was fabulous! Great, quick service. Delicious food--we especially like the green chili chicken soup. The bruschettas were much more flavorful than the day I posted my first review. Maybe an off day? In any case, give Postinos a chance or two. I'm impressed! (Also great patio seating)",

After waiting for a table and sitting down we opted to just order food and not leave.    Waitress was very nice, and food was prompt.  My daughter had the chicken and mozzarella panini and she said it was really dry.   Her side salad was good.  I had the bruschetta appetizer.   You pick four toppings and they serve it on four slices of bread.   I picked: 1:  warm artichoke spread 2:  fig, Apple, and Brie 3:  mozzarella, basil, and tomato 4:  roasted red pepper and goat cheese. All were very good.    Seemed a little pricey at $15",

However this last week when I took my girlfriend there, it was far from enjoyable. The meal started off alright, however there was an older couple that would not stop making out in the booth across from us. A kiss here and there is one thing but to have groping and non stop making out for the better part of an hour is just trashy and ruins the atmosphere. This is a restaurant not a movie theater or your bedroom.   I understand there isn't much a manager can do in that situation unless he witnesses it, however his staff, a guy by the name of Christian in particular, was incredibly rude and unhelpful when we complained about the situation. Instead of immediately grabbing a manager he chided us and talked down towards us. When he finally got a manager it was too little too late. And then the manager simply did too little to remedy the situation. Its a shame because we had enjoyed this place and perhaps we will enjoy another location in the future. But it is very unlikely that without a reach out from the manager for further remedy that we will ever visit this location again.",

And then the best thing on the menu is of course the bruschetta, all of them are really good.. haven't had one I don't like yet (my favorite though is Warm Artichoke Spread). Normally the bruschetta fills me up because the board itself is huge but the salads are & sandwiches are good as well. Highly recommend it here :) Also, nice ambiance, great patio!",

First of all, the very nice hostess gave us a choice to sit outside at a very cool almost party-like sitting area with couches and such.  We requested a heater, which was provided right away. She also nicely explained that we would have to give up our table in 3 hours to a reservation party and we were totally cool with that.  I sure appreciated having the option to be outside right away instead of having to wait for a table inside.  Then our waiter, Christian was also perfect, fun, personable, professional and right on task with all that we requested.  He suggested perfect menu items and made sure that everything went well with our 21 bday theme.  We will definitely return. We never had to look for him and we kept him busy!  He was always right there with all that we needed and we all enjoyed chatting with him, too!  Thank you Postino and Christian for making our memory so memorable!",

The hostess and waiters were really friendly and attentive of the my party of four. The interior of the restaurants create a laid back back and trendy environment. They do have different dining options between sitting outside, inside, and with different types of seating arrangements for example a booth, table or a lounge area. I had a pick 2 option to try both their soup and a half a panini. It was delicious. The soup was nice and warm and the panini had some very tasty bread. The meal was very filling and were good portions to satisfy your hunger. My meal was $11.35 which was worth it for the food and experience I received. They do have gluten free bruschetta, with a $2 surcharge! I know it can be difficult to find gluten free items on the menu, but it is an option at Postino!  I rode my bike to the location as I live on the ASU campus. However there are parking options for those who drive. It is located in a great location and a young neighborhood. It is close to Mill Ave and shopping centers. I would not recommend a family with small children coming here because it is almost like a wine bar and does not offer a kids menu. I would recommend this place for a casual but nice dinner with a group friends.",

    "text": "My first time at Postino was actually wonderful. There were four of us from work that decided to meet up on a Friday evening, and I believe this was in January. Our server was very attentive and patient with us since we were there for a couple hours, and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, I came here again this evening with a small group. It was busier than we were expecting for 4:00 pm on Friday - it wasn't nearly as busy the last time. The restaurant had little A/C on so all three of us were uncomfortably warm the entire time, which is awful in Arizona afternoon heat. We waited about 25 minutes to be seated, and when our server came to take our drink orders, he gave the impression that he himself was a bit tipsy with alcohol on his breath. I think we waited another half hour - just for our drinks! All the staff was attentive to keep our water cups filled, but still. We didn't get to order our food until the drinks came. Then it was another half hour or more of waiting, and our server admitted to us that it was due to the fact that he hadn't fully written down one of my friends' order. When the food did come out, my other friend was given chips with her panini instead of a salad as she requested. All of that combined would have made me give Postino four stars, because all the food was still delicious. But to top it off, there was a family of six that had small children seated next to us, and the children were loud, rambunctious and were, frankly, disturbing all of us near them. The children were running around the wine racks, running into servers, practically falling in other guests! I understand it should have been the supervising adults' job to get them to behave, but they clearly did not care with how much they were drinking. I was appalled that not one person in a managerial position came up to the family and asked them to get a handle on the children or leave! It almost fully ruined our dining experience.",

The board was a 4, the skewers were a 4 (the sauce was fantastic), but the winner was the sweet potatoes. Now it wasn't all that fantastic but the crisp outside and still firm inside was wonderful. It was lightly seasoned. But the sauce was so lovely. It was a spicy tahini sauce so good we had to order more.   I ordered their Argus cider. It was sweet and dry. So yummy. We will come back.",

We sat out on the patio after the breast cancer walk had no wait while others at the breakfast place next door were waiting up to 45 minutes. The pice I thought would be more but was in line with other places in this area. Would come back to try the dinner and wine which seems to be the main draw to this place. Really enjoyed the time there with my daughter and her two kids.",

    "text": "SO. GOOD. Every friend who's ever lived in the Phoenix area has told me to go to Postino, and I finally got to try the Tempe location out for a quick lunch on this past work trip.  My coworker and I shared the bruschetta board, which was delicious. Perfectly toasted bread with unique combos + classics. My favorites were the warm artichoke spread that had thick chunks of artichoke, as well as the prosciutto and fig.  I got the Brussels sprouts salad with chicken, and it was a huge, heaping portion of food. I loved the spicy almonds that they put in the salad, which added a nutty kick to the dish.   I was so sad when the meal was over because it was so good and I wanted to try all the bruschetta. I can't wait to come back!",

There was another time when I came to Postinos with friends, and they forgot one of our orders (bruschetta board). The server asked us to leave because we'd been there for a while, and when we informed them of our missing order, they said that the chefs were \"running behind\" on our order because of rush hour. Sure.   But! The food is good, same as the other locations. The mozzarella and tomato, brie and apple, and mascarpone with figs and prosciutto bruschetta are always solid, as is the prosciutto with brie panini. The sparkling rose is nice too.   In terms of service, I prefer the Gilbert location over the ASU and Downtown Phoenix ones.",

The bruschetta boards are huge and definitely enough for two people. I've also been to Postino for the occasional brunch or lunch, and they have a great $5 pitcher of beer/glass of wine deal that goes on before 5 p.m. every day. The entrees are decent, but on the smaller side, and nothing special.   The service at Postino's is what I think makes it most unique - all of the servers share tables and genuinely look out for everyone who comes in to dine. They're so friendly, and sometimes even take a seat at your table/lounge area to take your order or ask questions - love it!",

Our group typically go before 5 pm to get their 5 dollar pitcher of beer. They have a patio area that is well shaded and filled with tables and lounge areas. The weather can get hot in the summer but it's amazing during the spring late fall when sitting outside. The inside has a dark ambience with many tables that seat 4 people while also having a small lounge area for about 8 people. Thinking back I have had many celebrations and good byes here. I hope to come back one day! Postino is a must go if you are ever in Tempe! It is definitely a great place to hang out!",

    "text": "First off my friend who lives in Denver insisted on coming here to this location. She was in town for work. You have to pay to park in the parking Garage and Postino's does not validate. We sat on the Patio and for a Tuesday night they were quite busy. The place is nicely decorated and we were seated outside after just about a 12 min. wait. Not bad. Our server came directly to get us started. we all ordered drinks and my 2 dining companions ordered a Bruschetta. Which was beautiful and very nice tasting. We also ordered an appetizer of Olives. Julie wanted the Olives, I just have to say. Well I ordered Half a Sandwich and Soup. They other 2 each ordered a Salad. After about 30 minutes after the olives and Bruschetta came , I said it is really taking a long time to get our food. Julie called the waitress over and asked her how much longer did she think it was going to be till we got our food. At this time the waitress admitted that she had forgotten to put the order in. Hey, in my book worse things have happened. It could happen to anyone. I said well it is just a little too late now. I really did not need to eat anything else.  However,my friend was very upset and asked for the manager. The manager was a very nice young lady named Amanda. She apoligized ,even though it was not her fault and asked what she could do to make it better. I said nothing all is well, things happen. But, she still gave us a cheese plate and tried her best to keep the peace. The server did not seem too sorry. But, I felt sorry for the Manager as she was really upset for us and wanted to fix it as best as she could. I wish I could tell you more about the food. But, the cheese plate was good and so were the Olives and Bruschetta. Hey what can you do things happen. I would go back though. On another note the ladies room was clean with lots of T.P. everywhere. Very industrial.",

They do have a deal that a lot of my coworkers and supervisors love to take advantage of ~ the bruschetta board and wine bottle for $20 after a certain time in the evenings. Their bruschetta boards are always amazing no matter what combination you get!! For your first time, definitely get a bruschetta board and if you can't finish it, you'll have an amazing leftover midnight snack for later that night!",

They also have plenty of different types of seating which probably suits their college town customers well.  They have 2/4 tops, booths, bar seating and even couch seating...something for everyone.  We came here for happy hour, when they offer $5 wine and $5 beer pitchers.  The beer pitchers are not a standard full size beer pitcher, but about half that size.  It's enough to fill 2 glasses full and have a bit left.  Their wine selection is decent.  Try the grapefruit beer, it was my fav!  It's very similar to Schofferhofer Grapefruit beer.  My GF ordered the Bruschetta with gluten-free bread.  I was pretty impressed with their gluten-free bread.  It's a $2 surcharge.  I ordered the Sunshine Daydream salad and it seemed small and underwhelming for $10.  It also hardly had any dressing.  The service here is great!  Everyone is super friendly and helpful.  I've noticed that more restaurants are doing \"team serving\" where whoever is closest to you and not busy will come help you.  They all share the tip.  The guys were more friendly than the girls, though.  We ended up liking this place so much, we skipped out on trying a different gluten-free restaurant on our last day in Phoenix and came back here again, instead.  Their bathrooms are okay.",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday night right after graduation and was told that the wait would be 45 minutes. I am so glad that I didn't leave because I ended up only waiting about 20 minutes. Within that time, I was offered a drink while waiting.   When we got seated, we had a person in a wheelchair and they made sure to clear the path for us to get to our seat in the back of the restaurant. Super courteous! The service truly was one of the best I've experienced...they were very prompt and friendly.   Everything on the menu looked so good, we decided on brushetta and the meat & cheese board to start off. Each one was extremely good, one definitely tasted like caramel apple. For my actual meal, I got the prosciutto, fig, and brie panini. A great choice! The sweetness of the fig paired well with the saltiness of the prosciutto.   Next time I'm in Phoenix/Tempe area, I am definitely coming here! ...did I mention how cute the decor is too!",

Start out with their interesting blend of cucumber lemonade - it's so weird and so tasty!  everyone at the table did a double take after enjoying a sip!  I had their egg/potato combo with the green salad on the side.  it was delicate and so flavorful.  by friend had their deconstructed bagel/lox.  He LOVED everything on his plate.  And he said their French press coffee was nirvana...he drank 3 carafes of it - and then was dancing around for the rest of the day with all the caffeine :-)  definitely check this place out for brunch.  And I hear their wine menu is amazing - so we'll definitely be going back for dinner sometime",

My friends and I shared a board and it was a perfect amount for a small bite and glass of wine. The atmosphere was very upbeat and the vibes were super fun! 100% would recommend to anyone and will definitely be returning! Make sure you arrive early, the place was already packed around 7pm!!",

I've never been disappointed with any of my bruschetta selections.  One of my favorite wines they serve is the Stagedive Pinot Noir.  I was also excited to see that they were selling a Greek white wine. Such a great selection.    I've also been here for brunch. Their brunch food was also really great, not a huge selection, but I got sort of egg white omelet with asparagus and loved it.",

The music is great, the lighting is low, the decor is hip, the staff is friendly and the food and wine...top notch for relatively reasonable prices. I'm not a big salad \"fan\" but their raspberry chicken salad was probably the best salad I've ever had. Perfect combination of sweet and savory. Also can't go without ordering a bruschetta board--every combo we've had is delicious and fresh. My favorites are the fresh mozzarella and tomato, the Brie and apples (with amazing fig jam), and the warm artichoke spread. Better yet--make sure to go on a Monday or Tuesday to get their $20 bruschetta and wine deal. Great value. Their paninis are all really great too so i recommend a combo with half panini and one of their delicious salads. Great restaurant!",

    "text": "Postino Annex is a winecafe near ASU, and one of a few Postino restaurants in the Phoenix area. What is a wine cafe or winecafe anyway? I Googled \"winecafe,\" but I'm still not sure. Postino does serve wine, cheese boards, bruschetta, paninis, and some other odds and ends.  Our server probably captured the \"cool-without-trying\" vibe of the restaurant best: She was first to every punchline, wore a strong perfume and sweet dress, and wrapped her notebook around her wrist with a rubber band.  The food had its roses and thorns. The caprese starter was nontraditional. Called \"mozzarella and tomatoes\" on the menu, it was covered in a basil herb dressing that was fine, but had me wondering if I could have substituted in balsamic. The cheese and tomatoes themselves were top notch.  The bruschetta tasted great, but the toppings were overwhelming. Expect these slices of bread to be loaded with things you absolutely love, or spend the rest of your meal wondering what other mistakes you've made in life.  The cheese board was never (wasn't ever?) explained. Sigh, maybe there isn't a personal story about who milked what cow on what day behind every bite of dairy I eat.   If you're vegetarian, I'd recommend the vegetarian panini and accompanying salad. The cashews were a nice touch.  I struggle to categorize Postino Annex. Is it great Italian? Not really. Is it great cafe food? Kind of. Everything felt like an appetizer. What do you call that kind of restaurant? An Italian-American take on tapas restaurants? I guess \"winecafe\" will do for now. This is the kind of restaurant I'd come back to with friends looking to hang out and have an affordable glass of wine during happy hour.",

All of the bruschetta is amazing but I would recommend the Brie, apple & fig; the bacon burrata; and the salami & pesto.  We usually make the planks our meal because they're pretty heavy. If you have a big group, definitely check out the butcher's board -- they have a heavenly selection on cheeses.  I'm not the biggest fan of their brunch since there's not a huge selection but overall it is tasty.   I would say 4 out of 5 times the service is amazing (I'm talking about Randy) -- however, I have had a few servers who weren't that friendly (I expect that a few times it was because they were under staffed).  Overall, I put up with the sometimes shaky service because the ambiance is on point and the plank and wine deal is killer. Check it out if you're in Tempe!",

I've been to other restaurants with similar concepts, and the food just isn't the same.  In terms of this particular location, I'm not a huge fan.  Other locations around the valley, especially Gilbert, provide a different type of ambiance that I really enjoy and find unique.  The service wasn't great either.  We had to ask for water refills, which I hate since I feel like the servers should be attentive enough to their own tables.  But then again the water glasses are a bit on the smaller side so I can't judge too hard on that.  We were only checked up on when we called our server over for water refills.  Typically I feel like servers tend to check up on you within 10 minutes of you receiving your food, but I want to say this time it was a good 25-30 minutes before we had any attention from anyone at our table. My boyfriend enjoyed the romantic setting on a Saturday night but he told me he would never come back.  He is a big meat and potatoes kind of eater so the small bites of bruschetta and cheese just wasn't his thing.  And to tackle on the pricing made him convinced that we would never come back.   I would definitely come back with my girlfriends on a weekday afternoon and take advantage of their happy hour deals.  But other than that, I don't see myself returning on a weekend evening .",

I came here on a Friday night past happy hour was over, but still found the prices very reasonable.   I shared a bottle of prosecco, a bruschetta board, and the raspberry chicken salad. Everything was great. The best bruschetta for savory lovers were the white bean and also the artichoke dip.   Sign up for the email list and you can get a free board too! (Worth about 14 dollars)  Definitely will be coming back to this spot often!",

I plan on trying every single menu item, twice.  The beer selection is perfect; who can resist a good craft beer menu!?! I haven't tried their wine yet because I've been so busy drinking their beer, but I will definitely be changing it up soon! I'd like to start taking advantage of their happy hour though... they seem to have really great deals!  Service is always superb! One time, our bruschetta order came out wrong and they gave us a free one even though we begged them not to since we were going to order more anyway. The servers are very knowledgeable and extremely friendly, we love it!   Their location is so great, I am so happy that they opened up just across ASU and mill.  I will keep coming here every chance I get!",

    "text": "I rarely use Yelp to write reviews unless I have particular feedback to give.  My experience at Postino Arcadia and Central have been great, mostly because I take advantage of their wine/bruschetta combo. Postino Annex is a different story. I went there for lunch (which was a 1st for me) so I ordered the Italian Picnic salad. The waitress was very nice and helpful.  The description says: Fresh greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette.  Sounds great right? I'm vegan so I asked for no cheese and no bacon, and instead I asked to add quinoa and extra root vegetables (and I asked the waitress to charge me extra if needed).  What came to my table was: Fresh greens - Yes Roasted beets - No. Not roasted, just very soft cooked COLD golden beets. Not seasoned, not anything. My guess is they were from a can.  Walnuts - Yes Crisped root vegetables - No. I asked for extra of these and there were NONE. What they put instead was this tortilla-like strips of root-vegetable colors that tasted like, well, tortilla strips. There wasn't any root vegetables to be seen.  Herb vinaigrette - Barely any dressing on, was on the dry side.  The quinoa I requested to be added was I kid you not, less than a tablespoon mixed throughout the salad.  For $9.50 at Pita Jungle I could've gotten a giant, fresh, real crisped root vegetables salad that satisfied me and had actual substance. This joke of a salad came to my table and when my waitress asked after 2 seconds if it looked good I said yes (it did looked good).  As I searched for the vegetables and the quinoa I realized they had given me whatever that was, and my waitress NEVER came back to check on me again when I wanted to ask a few questions about my salad. A good half hour and I would see her maybe walking by fast, not looking our way.  Not her fault (she was super sweet, very nice, I liked her a lot) but I was not happy with my salad at all, and the cold soft beets and tortilla strips were super disappointing.   So no, I will not be coming back. No good vegetarian/vegan options and any substitutions you may ask for may or may not work out.  -Julie",

    "text": "There was a time where Postino Arcadia was my favorite location but after my visit to the Annex, I'm afraid Arcadia no longer holds top spot in my heart. Granted their Arcadia location is super cozy and your neighbors can be up close and personal, the Annex location has a lot of space but still retains a certain character that's unique to it's location. I love they have a large patio area, and the inside has large booths for big groups, add the long bar which is accessible to the inside and patio, makes wine drinking and bruschetta boards noshing far more enjoyable. It would have been a nice touch if there were fire pits outside when it gets far cooler to be on the patio but the candle pits are aesthetically appealing too.   I like to commend our main server Nick, he was pleasant and took the time to assist my friend's allergies with nuts and citrus. He's top notch, and an asset to the Postino Annex staff. I think there are new additions to the bruschetta such as the Salami with Pesto which was oh so scrumptious, the pesto on the MJ bread hit the spot! Overall, love the new addition to the Postino family, and looking forward to enjoying wine sips under the tea-lights at the Annex. :)",

We had a party of six so we called ahead to make a reservation and were told it wouldn't be necessary but when we got here we had to wait for them to clean off some tables at a snails pace that took 10 minutes.  We then waited for our waiter for another 10 minutes before he came to greet us.  Thank goodness at least the water girl was on top of her stuff and came over right when we were seated.  Once our waiter finally arrived he took our wine bottle order and our food orders. 15 minutes later the wrong bottle of wine showed up, no food. When we notified them they left with the bottle and didn't come back with a new one for the entire time it took me to write up to this point (5 minutes). Oh finally the soup came! We waited another 10 minutes for food which came out for 4 of us first and then 5 minutes later the last two came out, I couldn't believe it after everything else. But of course when the food FINALLY did come it was AMAZING as always.   5 stars for food 1 for service- get your shit together?!",

Now granted I have not been to the Gilbert location and I hear that it is the biggest one of them all, but I can honestly say that if I lived closer to this one, I would definitely become a regular.  It was packed on a Monday night, but then again it was $20 board and wine so why would it not be? Almost every seat, inside and out (which says a lot because even the outside area is huge) was taken. Our lovely server who's name escapes was fabulous. Actually everyone was very friendly and great which is one thing I do love about all the Postino locations. I have yet to have a bad experience (knock on wood) I will definitely be back again soon.",

I thought it would be a nice place - lively patio with misters outside, college scene - but I was pleasantly surprised with the pretty interior, incredible waitstaff, and of course the wine and bruschetta. VERY pleasantly surprised. It could have been just another trendy tiresome eat, but instead we were treated to delicious food and drink. Very reasonably priced, and such a cool atmosphere - comfy booths along one side, bar on the other - somehow not feeling cramped at all. The serving lane runs the length of the other side of the booths so servers are always there but never in the way. Cool concept. We were interested in the $5/glass wine. I figured this would be a limited selection, but it turned out to include the entire wine selection! Bruschetta selections were extensive and every one was tasty and unique. When salami came instead of salmon (oops), the exchange was made immediately without fuss. I like this kind of bruschetta on toasted yet toothsome bread that doesn't hurt to bite into, if you know what I mean. Another plus: the server was so personable to our 2 year old companion, bringing her wikistix to play with and generally being the sort of person young children adore. That was a nice touch.",

This wasn't the first time I've attempted to go to Postino's. If you get there late, there's too much of a wait to enjoy it for a workday lunch... but my two coworkers and I arrived around 11:30 today and had no problem getting a lovely table outside in the sunshine! Our service was friendly and quick, and our glasses were never empty. I've heard about the legendary bruschetta, but today, I opted for a turkey panini. (I hear that their happy hour is a pretty bomb deal on the bruschetta. It's regularly $14 for 4 pieces, but at happy hour, you can pay $20 for the same 4-pieces AND get a bottle of wine... so I imagine I'll be coming back to try it then!) That said, I was really happy with my selection! I should've had a salad with it, because once I saw the greens, they looked really good... but I went with the chips. They were a little greasier than I care for, but still very good! The sandwich was fantastic!!! I had mine on focaccia and it was delicious - melty, warm and the pesto really gave it a good finish!   The price was reasonable for a lunch out (around $13), and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day. I'll definitely be back here again soon! (Preferably for their happy hour... it looked like they had a great wine selection too!)",

The 11-5 specials are amazing-$5 pitchers of any draft beer and $5 glasses of wine (any wine on the menu). They also have a Monday/Tuesday special that includes a bottle of wine and a bruschetta for $20. I had the Boatman Wine, which is usually $11. It was a very smooth red.  We tried a variety of bruschetta's and the pub board. I loved that the bruschetta's were all freshly made with bread that wasn't as hard as toast like others I've tried. The pub board was also very good. Had corn nuts, pretzels, pickles, cheese and mustard.  The patio is very cool. We sat there before the ASU game and there was so much going on right in front of the restaurant.  Service was good. Always attentive servers and kept our drinks full even though they were busy.  Also had a kids menu with a super yummy grilled cheese. Gave the kids some Wikki Stix to play with, which they loved.  We will definitely be going back soon!",

I was charged twice on my visit on July 19th, and a friend with me that night was also double charged... a week later. How exactly do they have her credit card information, such that they can charge her a week later? Of course, I don't appreciate being doubled charged and so I called them when I found it on my statement, hoping that they would make it right. I spoke with Brandon, the manager on duty at the time I called, and he was about as interested in helping me as my grandmother would be in attending a Nikki Minaj concert. He listened as I explained my problem, offered a haphazard apology, (Red Flag #1)  and took down my info, saying he would give it to his accounting department and they would contact me \"if, I mean, when\" they are able to credit it back to me. (If? Really? Nice save, dude. Red Flag #2) It's been over 2 weeks since that call, and who's surprised? I've heard nothing back. (Red Flag and Strike #3) I have never been so disappointed in a customer service manager, and I will never visit any Postino again. I would hate for it to be True that they are indeed storing credit card information, but until I get some reasonable explanation for their nefarious credit card operations, they can double charge someone else. Steer clear or pay with cash, and be sure to check your credit card statements.",

The bruschetta is not your typical diced tomatoes toppings.  They give you four breads and you can get a different topping on each one!   Variety was great for us- a table of four.  We all got to have a taste of everyone's pick.    This should be a 4.5 rating.  The problem is we didn't get a drink for nearly 20 minutes after being sat.  We think the hostess screwed up because we never got silverware and the only way we got service was when a person came by to refill our waters, we let her know we haven't been attended to yet.  She was very apologetic and the experience was flawless from that point forward.",

We tried many types of bruschetta: warm artichoke, smoked salmon with capers and red onion, brie & apple, traditional, white bean with chopped tomatoes, and bacon, burrata, tomato and arugula.    They were all on thick slices of bread and generously loaded with the toppings.  I loved all of them, but the smoked salmon with capers and red onion stood out as the best one. Absolutely delicious.    We tried the Cabernet Sauvingnon and Malbec.  Enjoyed both of these full-bodied wines, perhaps the Malbec ever-so-slightly more than the Cab.   Service was a bit slow.

The Bruschetta is quite large and we ordered 2 the first time and then came back after the football game and ordered 4 more.    The entire experience was nice.  The one downside was a bartender who we basically didn't even speak to just came over and gave us our check like he was saying \"time to leave,\" and we had only been there for 30 minutes.  It was obviously a mistake but it is not a professional way to go about things.  Our normal bartender fixed the problem.  They are a little unorganized there so if they tighten up their processes then it would be a 5-star review.",

Our waitress was very accommodating and corrected an error with our order graciously. The bass from the music is way too much but people can still hear each other for the most part. The only big suggestion I have is that it would be much better if the bruschetta boards would allow more flavors instead of just four because even with two boards it's not enough to try every single flavor...",

We split the bruschetta (4 flavors) and the Bounty (veggie and dips platter). It was plenty for the 3 in our party. Fresh and delicious. But the real treat was server, Stef! She was excellent providing wine recommendations as well as food options. Ask for Stef. You won't be disappointed!!!",

You get to select four from a larger variety of bruschetta (some really good choices) and get a bottle of red or white wine and it's $20.  The bruschetta is well made with good combinations of ingredients (each one is cut into a couple/few pieces and are definitely large enough to share; all four can easily go two or three ways!).  The wine was good.  We had to wait to get seated, but then weren't rushed to leave.  We sat outdoors; heaters were sufficient even with a fairly cold evening.  Service was cordial.  It's a pleasant, tasty experience that is just priced right!",

Nothing on the menu is very substantial, but what they do serve is also good and reasonably priced.  And the outside patio is a great place to sit when the weather is nice.  Knocking off one star for the service my wife and I received today by Christian.  Completely ignored our table even though the place was pretty much empty (though he did make numerous stops to the table behind ours).  We were seated for 5-10 minutes before he made an appearance.  We ordered immediately since we could see this would take awhile.  The food took much longer than 2 panini's should take.  And when we were done eating we sat for another 15 minutes before the hostess grabbed my card to close us out (the bill was never even brought to us).  I'm sure we will be back, but have learned the hard way that this isn't a place for a quick lunch.",

There were a good number of people waiting to get in after we were seated and really...I don't see why. I think it's a sub-par restaurant that is capitalizing on some very good real estate. I left hungry and dissatisfied with the food and don't see myself coming back anytime soon to eat. I would however come back to have drinks on the patio which I think is what most people have in mind. I think they are better suited as a bar than a restaurant.",

Maybe I'm biased because I used to work at Joyride (On Central and Camelback - Go eat there it's the best), and maybe it's because Upward Projects is one of the best companies out there that serves up delicious food with an amazing staff (I know first hand but again not being biased, just stating the facts)...But Postino has been one of my favorite spots in both Tempe and Uptown since I discovered it almost four years ago. It took me a long time to venture into getting the Bruschetta's because I love the sandwiches so much. The chicken and mozzarella and the turkey are my favorite and please do us all a favor and get it on focaccia because there is just no other way.  I've had the bruschetta a few times now and I've tried a variety of flavors and none of them have been a disappointment. My favorite is and will always be the apple with fig spread. Literally just so good.  I usually go to Postino during work lunches so I don't drink but I love how every Upward Project restaurant has their $5 until 5 (glasses of wine and pitchers of beer). Will continue to come back here until I get sick of it.",

I drove around for almost 15 minutes before I found a paid parking spot. This was only a big deal because I came for lunch during the week, 15 minutes seriously cuts into my time.  2. The interior is setup really odd. If felt congested and crammed. Almost like it was a personal challenge to see how impersonal and intimate they could make it feel without giving anyone any privacy. I truly detest the way they're setup on the inside. Alas, I crammed myself into a long bar to have lunch with little room to move. If I wanted a table to have lunch on a Thursday it would have been a 30 minute wait (which I didn't have since I spent 15 minutes trying to park).  3.  I ordered the tuna melt panini with homemade chips and the potato leek soup. I must confess the soup was really good! The tuna salad itself was good but the panini was so hard, the roof of my mouth started bleeding. I could barely bite into the sandwich. I ended up eating the inside and avoiding the bread altogether. The house made chips were ok, a nice compliment to the tuna without bread.  Overall, okay food but the parking and atmosphere left much to be desired. They need a knock out menu to supplement for the awkward and uncomfortable setup.",

We walked in and it was a little hot outside so we decided to get a table inside. Very modern looking, lots of energy, with music and very friendly service.   We decided to start off with the bruschetta appetizer. You get to pick four different kinds and you get four slices of each bruschetta. Perfect for our party of four cause we each got to try each one. We picked Brie & Apple with fig spread, Smoked Salmon with pesto, White bean with chopped tomatoes, and Warm Artichoke spread. We all loved it. It was so good and you get to try each one and experience the different favors. My favorite was the Brie & Apple with a close second the White Bean. Like i said they were all good with lots of flavors bursting out.   For dinner, we all ordered the two for $10 where you get a half Panini and half a Salad. I picked the Chicken & Mozzarella panini on ciabatta with arugula, organic chicken with a spicy sun dried tomato mayo. I really enjoyed it and loved the kick with the spicy mayo. The salad I picked was the Raspberry Chicken. It had pecans and apples in a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Really nice salad and enjoyed it a lot. The panini and salad was really good and enjoyed the dinner.   My wife had the Turkey Panini on Ciabatta and Hannah's Field salad. She really enjoyed it and it filled her up. No complaints from her.   The service was great. Once we got to the table our server greeted us and brought us our drinks. Our food came in a timely manner and the servers kept our water cups filled every time. The servers had a smile all the time and really looked like they enjoyed being there.   So the place is filled with college students with a few older people but that's okay cause the food is really good, great service, and a really nice atmosphere. As you can tell I really enjoyed it and will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Oh Postino's how I have missed you!   I remember when I first went to thier original location with my good friend Tyler. Such a quaint location, with a great story and wonderful food. There was live trumpet music and a DJ in the background & I knew I would keep coming back.  Which I did, until parking and getting a seat became very very difficult due to the popularity of the restaurant.  I continued to go, of course, but much less frequently.    Fast forward several years...My husband and I were gearing up and getting ready to go on a date for brunch.  I turned to my trusty YELP and saw they have several locations, 2 of which are close to my home and we chose this one for our Sunday Funday Brunch Date.   It is a lovely location. I am an early bird so there was plenty of parking on the street, however I can see this being a little more complicated for dinner on a date night.   We were greeted immediately and seated just were my hubby wanted, a spot inside with a nice view of the outside.  They have these garage doors that can close in the hot weather but allow you to see thier patio. We decided to forego the traditional brunch fare and ordered thier bruschetta and some beer.  Our waiter was so very well versed on beers we spoke to him for a while about thier selection.  We ended up having a fabulous seasonal beer that had a wonderful toasted flavor due to the way it was made and our waiter filled us in on this process. The food was beautiful, fresh, amazing and made with superb ingredients. I love to order my favorites and leave space for the seasonal offering. The seasonal option had lots of mushroom and truffle oil...it was delish. The mushrooms were almost meaty in flavor and consisteny.  We also shared a bacon burrata which I didn't recall having before and I was amazing. It had arugula, which imparted a very fresh flavor, the creaminess of the burrata was a nice contrast in texture to the crispy bacon bits which were plentiful on the bruschetta.    I can't wait to go back and try some more food, beer and wine. =)",

We could have still made it to our other plans had our server showed up on time--- but he didnt even welcome/greet us for 15-20 minutes after we sat down... We ended up having to cancel our other plans, which was the most annoying part...",

The service is fast, and they're always really nice and cater to what we want. The bruschetta's are all really amazing but I love the roasted pepper bruschetta, it's the best!! They're also able to cork your wine so you can take it home if you don't finish. Absolutely great, I recommend it!",

The outside is pretty cute with comfy couches and chairs if you have a big group or just plain tables and chairs too. There are hanging lights outside and candles inside. It is pretty dark inside.   The food is delicious! I got a bruschetta to share with one of my friends. It is $14.95 and a good size for two people. You can pick four different flavors. We tried the artichoke spread, tomato basil and mozzarella, apple and fig, and pesto with salami. They were all really good. I think my favorite one was the apple fig one but they honestly all were really good. We also got the salty caramel sundae dessert. That was good too.  I would definitely recommend this place to other people! It is a great place for date night, a girls night out, catching up with friends, etc.",

If you can tell me you don't crave their bruschetta boards at all hours of the day - I'm going to have to tell you you're lying! My favorite is subbing the salami on their pesto one with chicken.... SO YUM! Also a must try is their brussel sprout salad, definitely one of my favorites. There is no doubt that Mondays and Tuesday's are the best days to go. After 8 pm you can get a bottle AND board of bruschetta for only $20! However, I'll still splurge and pay the extra money when I'm craving it because like I said before, you can't go wrong! Postino, any location, is one of the valley's hottest spots. Their staff, their food, and their vibes never fail to impress me.",

I highly recommended the chicken and mozzarella panini. You can get it on either focaccia or ciabatta bread-it has grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, arugula, and this spicy sun-dried tomato mayo that has just a little kick. For dessert, we split the salted caramel sundae- O.M.G! It was soooo good! Vanilla ice cream served with chocolate covered corn nuts, pretzel sticks and hot caramel sauce on the side!   For those concerned about parking, Postinos is a quick 3 minute walk from the Veterans/College Ave light rail stop. The service was exceptional! Our waitress was super sweet and attentive, but several other wait staff were also periodically checking in on us too.  Great ambiance and cute little patio area for our beautiful AZ fall nights!   Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Having a case of the Monday Blues or just need to unwind already after a \"rough\" start to the week? Welp Postino's seems to be the perfect place to wind up on a Monday or Tuesday night. Why?? Well because it's perfect for a special deal on a Board of Bruschetta and a Bottle of wine. I went out for a girls night on Tuesday and it was such a great time. Deal starts at 8pm and lasts all night (I mean until close at 12am).   So here's the deal you get a board of 4 Bruschetta (you choose!) and ANY bottle of wine (you decide this also!) all for $20. They have a fun variety of gourmet bruschetta to choose from. My fav was the Brie and Apples with Fig Spread. Yummy!! The board alone any other day or time of the week is $15. So you're getting the same amount of Bruchetta your way plus a whole bottle of wine. And you can share...whaaat?! Now we have a whole new meaning to \"wine\" about at the start of the week. (No pun intended! )   Call your girls (and guys too!) The fun doesn't have to end at Sunday Brunch and you don't have to be miserable waiting all week for Friday...Saturday...Sunday to make it's way back. Who can pass that deal up??   Well....Not many people do and this place gets PACKED! But come on, think about it, you'll wait longer for Friday to come along. Just be sure to arrive early and pencil your name into their waiting list. You'll either wait a while or only a little... depending on your group size and how busy they get. Trust me it's worth the wait!  Once you're in you will be seated to your table and it's time to enjoy. Your server will be with you promptly (so for my own experience, it's has been such). Everytime I've gone these servers have been the most understand people of their customers \"Beginning of the week Blues\". Ok exaggerating much but you'll be in good hands.  Your need to quench your appetite and thirst will not go unnoticed. Cheers to Brunch Jr.!",

I met a girlfriend here after work one day, and the crowd was different because of the location - but I guess the \"kids\" like wine too these days. Haha!

I've been to the Central, Highland and Kierland locations and now here. Thankfully my brother got here early and snagged us a reservation because by the time I arrived around 530, the wait was decent due to the heat and no one wanting to sit on their patio. Come \"winter\", that'll be a great spot to enjoy the cooler weather.  We had a nice, spacious booth at the entrance. Always seem to order a bruschetta board here and am never disappointed. This time, I got their sweet pepper jam with goat cheese, almond hummus with tomatoes, ricotta date pistachio (duh), and smoked salmon with pesto. Thinking I need to wean myself off the salmon as my stomach doesn't always approve, but the rest of my choices were solid. Probably should expand on what I order next time too.

French onion soup was just ok.   Wide variety of wines by the glass. Really liked the Malbec.   They have happy hour and some other specials on certain nights of the week.   Our server, Bree, was lovely and took good care of us.",

The thing that makes this location different from the others is the patio! At night there's white lights dripping from the trees and I'm a sucker for white lights.   My suggestion is going on a Monday or Tuesday after 8pm for the $20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta but sit outside on the patio!",

Waiting on a friend. Ice tea shows several minutes later. No straw. Why? I find it odd to not be offered one . I know... I'm weird.  Friend shows.... order glasses of wine. Love the choices fir $5 during Happy Hour.  Got the Bruschetta 4 choices and the Caprese salad. Both okay. Nothing special.  What I did notice was the loud music. It was quite distracting. Could barely hear normal conversation outside.  I like it here.... but many other places in Tempe to go to.",

    "text": "Dropped by Postino Annex on a weekday night and was pleasantly surprised with the fact that there was no wait! Yay! Our party of 2 was seated right away and our server came over and introduced himself to us shortly thereafter.   Now in terms of food, of course we had to try the bruschetta. We ended up getting the tomato-mozzarella-basil, the artichoke, the goat cheese and red peppers, and the brie+ apple+fig spread for some savory bites followed by something sweet.  All 4 types of bruschetta were really good, but my standouts were definitely the goat cheese + red peppers and the brie+apple+fig spread ones! I have a special place in my heart for goat cheese so anything with goat cheese is usually a winner for me. I was a bit hesitant about the brie, apple, and fig spread combo, but it was deeelicious and really helped us end our meal on a sweet note!   We also grabbed the vegetarian panini with the salad on the side. Now, the vegetarian panini portion was INSANE, aka so large that we each ate half of ONE half -- aka a quarter each -- and ended up taking the rest home. The pine nut salad was really yummy and I was glad to chow down on some veggies rather than indulging in more carbs as I usually tend to do!  Service was great and we didn't have any issues with getting water refills, boxes, or the bill. Overall, such a great place to check out if you are in the area and want some yummy food options!",

The beer and wine selection was also a bonus. After a great first experience, we went back before the ASU game for drinks and after the game on Saturday evening for food and drinks and had just as good of a time, even closed it down on Saturday night.  Jess, Randy, Cassie(sp)and the rest of the group made our evenings memorable.  Looking forward to going back in November.",

The sandwich tasted better than the scramble due to the deliciously perfect bacon and the bread was soft and warm but the eggs tasted bland and boring. The salad that accompanied the scramble was better due to the dressing but overall the food was mediocre.

You can get pitchers of craft beer like Kiltlifter and glasses of wine for $5 before 5 pm.  Food is fresh and delicious.  You can order just 2 bruschettas if you are not that hungry or half of a panini and half of a salad if you are hungry..  It is not just about bruschetta.  The Italian Picnic Salad is just full of ingredients - not just a layer of ingredients over lettuce.  Brunch on the weekends is until 1 pm.  I love the Ciabatta French Toast with Creme Fraiche, Almonds, Strawberries and house made raspberry preserves.",

    "text": "We came into Postino a couple of weeks ago for a quick lunch. We got there probably a half hour after they opened and there was already a reasonably sized crowd that got larger by the time we left.  I was pleased with the wide selection of wines available. I would maybe have liked to see a little bit more of a description of the taste/features of some of the less well known varieties for us uninitiated. I had the Llebre red-blend from Spain and really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to trying something else next time.  We ordered the spinach/artichoke dip and hummus as a starter, and bruschetta planks as the main. The breads were excellent, as were the dips.  The bruschetta was excellent as well. We ordered four different varieties, which came as two pretty decently sized pieces each. We ordered the prosciutto and fig, the brie and apple, the tomato jam and sheep's milk cheese, and the smoked salmon with pesto. The tomato jam one was particularly intriguing to me. I can't really come up with a better descriptor other than it tasted like Christmas. It was very unique. I wasn't a huge fan of the smoked salmon/pesto variety but that may be more of my dislike of pesto than anything else. The other two were delicious as well.  One interesting thing was that it seemed like there were twice as many staff as there ought to have been working at that time. I had probably six or seven people who refilled drinks, asked how I was doing, and in general waited on us during the hour or so we were there. It seemed a little unnecessary.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone for a casual yet upscale lunch, and am looking forward to returning again soon.",

The location is awesome right by ASU's campus in an older but revamped building. We checked it out on Tuesday night so we took advantage of the $20 bruschetta and wine deal.  The food- held up to the Postino name and was delicious! We split a board and panini. The prosciutto and brie panini is one of my favorite things to order from here. We also tried the seasonal bruschetta which wasn't my favorite, but my girlfriend loved.   Service- We've noticed that the service at the other locations can be hit or miss especially when it gets busy. Our server Vivienne was so nice and recommended a wine for us that we hadn't tried yet. The place got pretty busy but she kept checking in on us and made sure we were happy campers. A few other servers came by too to make sure we were satisfied. Everything flowed really well.   Price- Uh hello $20 for a board and bottle. You honestly can't top that.   All in all, this location is off to a great start. If you're familiar with the other Postino's you'll love this addition. It's great when you leave a restaurant and the experience meets or even exceeds already high expectations. We'll definitely be coming back soon!",

It doesn't draw the same amount of people as the restaurant next door which is why we picked it. I'm not sure why we were made to wait 20 minutes (I needed a table for 10) for a table when the table we sat at was available when I put my name down.   I should have checked before I paid for the bill but they mistakenly charged me for a couple of drinks.",

And the ambiance outside was phenomenal especially coming into the fall weather.  My sister and our friend got the bottle and board special at $20 for a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine. We got 2 boards and 2 wines. It was a pretty good amount for 3 people. We had pushed to finish all of the bruschetta (fatties haha) but it was just so delicious... and we had a little bit of left over wine that we took home.  My favorite bruschetta was the salmon and pesto and the apple one...but all of the ones we got were delicious. I didn't know what to eat first. We got a Moscato d'asti (so freaking good...I probably had 2-3 glasses total and was feeling good after dinner lol).  Anyways..it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Love Postino. I've been here and their other locations several times over, and I have never regretted my choice.  Their bottle + board is the best deal in town (as noted in my other reviews). Their brunch (which is what I came here for today) is pretty good too, but it doesn't beat its bruschetta. Though the food was good, I felt like the options were pretty limited. Most things include bacon, and it's not quite my favorite thing in the world - I know I'm in the minority!! I think there might have only been one other item that included a protein that didn't come with bacon. I'm assuming you'd be able to get it substituted though, but I didn't ask since mine didn't come with a protein. I'd suggest going to Snooze if you have the time, patience, and the lack of hunger to wait.   Though I won't choose Postino as my first choice for brunch, I am still giving it 4 stars because of the other items I've enjoyed over my time here: bruschetta, paninis, salads, wine selection, etc.",

We had amazing service from our waitress Gabriela - she navigated our large party with ease. Thank you both!  Food is amazing as always. :) My go-to din is the half/half with Mixed Greens Salads and Chicken Mozzarella Panini. Of course you can't go wrong with bruschetta either! Faves there are smoked salmon, artichoke dip, and burrata and bacon. I heart you Postino!",

Their gluten-free bread for the bruschetta was fluffy and soft. I was so happy with eating four different options. Two sweet, included dates and pistachios, then apples, honey and fig jam. The savory ones I enjoyed were roasted peppers and bacon and  arugula. All came with a cheese spread but can't remember them all!  My husband and I were headed back to CA from our anniversary road trip, so we dressed up and went out here! They gave a creme brulee  on the house wishing us a Happy Anniversary!  We had already had champagne earlier so we didn't enjoy their wine selection. This is a must go to now when I'll be back in town.",

I'm a relatively quiet person and hate starting scenes, but it's honestly so frustrating when you get there earlier than other people only to be given a table last just because you're a casually dressed young adult by yourself. I've had staff members pass and ignore me by the door and sometimes take as long as ten minutes just to seat me. And there was a time when it took me over half an hour just to flag my server down and get my check actually brought to the table! Mind you, I had an almost two hour break, and this restaurant was like a five minute walk to my building; for me to have to sprint and be on the verge of late just because of long waits/terrible service was ridiculous! If you're willing to splurge on delicious but expensive food and have nowhere important to be afterwards, then by all means, go eat here. But I recommend just getting your order to go because it's somewhat faster and you won't have to technically tip, plus there are other places you can sit that are less hectic. You could always just eat at another place, too, since Downtown Tempe has no shortage of restaurants.",

It's large, right off the street, and they have ample tables and cushioned seating for larger parties.   I came here for the $20 bottle and board deal they have on Mondays and Tuesdays and it was just as delicious as every other time I've visited!  This time I shared the roasted bell peppers and goat cheese (highly recommend), tomato and mozzarella, apple and fig, and the smoked salmon with pesto. The first three are my favorite!! The salmon was for my friend which unfortunately I didn't sample. My favorite part about this place is how they slice the bruschetta into 4 pieces. I know that's like the simplest thing but you would be surprised how many places don't do this!! It makes sharing so easy that's why I always get the board with a friend. If you're thinking about getting a panini or salad, DO IT! They are also just as delicious.   The service was amazing! The server dropped a piece of my friend's bruschetta and he brought out another one right away! Everyone from hostess to servers were just so sweet and ready to help. I will definitely be returning to this location soon! :)",

The place is 50-50 in terms of indoor/outdoor seating which is nice in the cooler months but can be a bit harsh in the summer.  That said, it doesn't take away the amazing service, delicious food and great selection of wine. I love the $20 wine & bruschetta specials they have Monday and Tuesday nights. SO yummy!  My advice is, get there early so you can get a spot otherwise it can get pretty full and your wait will be long! Overall, amazing place.",

    "text": "Postino was next to Snooze and Snooze had a long waiting line. Luckily when I went to Postino, there was an open table there. The wait for my bruschetta was pretty long. It was about 20 to 30 minutes from ordering to getting the bruschetta.  I had the bruschetta and chose the Brie, apple, and fig spread. I also chose the prosciutto di Parma, fig, and marscapone. The third one I chose was the warm artichoke spread. The last one I chose was the smoked salmon and pesto.  The Brie bruschetta was good, but not as tasty as I remember. I think this was because there wasn't much fig spread on it. The prosciutto bruschetta was also good, but not as flavorful as the others I chose. I do like the flavor of marscapone though. I thought the artichoke bruschetta tasted a bit like pizza. There must be an herb in it that restaurants use for pizza. I think it might have been oregano. The smoked salmon bruschetta was a bit tougher to eat because it was hard to bite through the salmon. The salmon was a bit salty and so were the capers. I feel like the capers are like little olives. While I don't like olives, the capers were ok.  If I ever went for bruschetta again, I'd like to try out the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil even though it seems like a simple one I could make at home.  I also had the farm scramble. This consisted of eggs scrambled with some potato pieces, onion, gruyere, and white cheddar. The eggs were soft and fluffy. The cheese was tasty. I was disappointed that there wasn't more potato. The mixed greens was mostly just red leaf lettuce with a very light vinaigrette. The tomatoes had a lot of pesto on it. I probably should have mixed the pesto tomatoes together with the lettuce.",

    "text": "Postino Annex was my go-to place when I was a student at ASU. There are so many things to love about Postino Annex: it is in an amazing location, is practically on campus, and has a terrific menu. I have never had a bad thing from Postino, but there are definitely some menu items I love more than the rest.  The chicken and mozzarella panini is by far my favorite panini option. The sun dried tomato aioli is to die for! In terms of bruschetta boards, the warm artichoke spread is by far the best! More often than not, I end up choosing 2 warm artichoke spreads on my board. The apple, fig, and brie option is also an honorable mention.   Happy hour runs from opening to 5 pm and features $5 pitchers of craft beer (fair warning: the pitchers are smaller than normal pitchers, but for $5 who can complain?) or $5 glasses of wine.    I've been to many Postino locations and while they're all amazing, I will say service is slowest at Postino Annex. Regardless, I highly recommend it to everyone who is in town!",

Ours were; brie, apple, and fig spread, burrata, bacon, arugula, & tomato, smoked salmon and pesto, and sweet & spicy pepper jam and goat cheese. They were delicious, but I should have asked exactly what was on them, as the salmon included red onions and capers, and the others were covered in tiny bits of scallions. I hate both. Kind of ruined the taste for me. But if I had known, I'm sure they would have left them off. Next time!",

However, i gave them 4 stars because of the paninis still overpriced but omg, so delicious. We had the vegetarian panini and the roast beef panini(pics attached).   Place: it was crowded but we got seated immediately, and the place in general is nice.  Service: all of them young servers and it was good service.   Price: very expensive compared to the portion \"and the quality\", even if you have organic food somewhere else with the same portions it will be less for sure.",

Monday's and Tuesday's, they do a bottle of wine and a full board of bruschetta (4 big pieces!) for $25. They recently raised this from $20, but it's still an amazing deal. The brunch is also fantastic. My favorite thing about this place is that everyday before 5pm, they have happy hour that includes $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer. Definitely the place to go if you're looking for drink specials!  Staff is always friendly, but they do get super busy at times which can sometimes slow staff down to take care of you. They have indoor and outdoor seating, as well as bar seating. Ideal for smaller groups, but if you do have a large group going be sure to arrive early as you will most likely need to wait at peak times.",

A couple things to keep in mind before visiting:   Check out their happy hour times (they have great deals on wine/beer)  This is not fine dining, I would consider it sophisticated-casual eats.   This specific location can be hard to find parking-plan accordingly.    When I dined at this location I sat at the bar and was immediately acknowledged by the bartender. He quickly showed me the wine list and gave me a few samples to help me find a red blend that suited my taste.    What I ordered: Bruschetta board! This was a fun thing to choose because you get to mix and match ( 4 large pieces of bread) and assortment of creative combinations.    Overall, this is such a lively place to enjoy. I love meeting friends here when I come into town because it is the perfect place to just sip on a few glasses of wine and catch up over delicious bites.  See you next time Postino!",

Or sitting near a heater at night is also great!  I suggest coming when there is happy hour happening. I believe that is Sunday during the day or at night. You'll need to check their menu.  Their NYC grilled cheese sandwiches are amazing, btw. And like I said, I like their board. If I can compare, I would maybe compare to North Italia's board although I think North Italia has a bigger board at a cheaper price. Well, sometimes, when you're in Tempe, you don't feel like driving to Phoenix.  So P. Annex in Tempe does it's job if you are looking for that kind of semi-fancy Italian/American food fare with wine/beer.",

We also ordered a bruschetta board, which you can mix and match 4 of the options. We decided to go with the brie & apples, salami with pesto, ricotta with pistachios, and artichoke spread. My favorites were the salami with pesto and the artichoke spread. Both were rockin some serious flavor points.

There aren't a ton of entrees here - mostly boards, bruschetta, paninis, and some desserts. Drink list is mostly beer and wine (fine for me, but no cocktails if that's what you're seeking). We split some bruschetta - you pick 4 varities -  and a pub board - both were fantastic and flavors were unique and spot-on. Call me crazy, but the soft pretzel on that pub board was KILLER. There's a flavor combo to suit most any palette on the menu! Our friend ordered a panini and we split some meatballs to help round out the meal - he loved the sandwich and the meatballs were delicious and covered in yummy goat cheese pockets. The great stand-out here was the service - our server was personable, fun, and helpful with the menu. A great evening with friends, topped up by a great atmosphere and good food.

So I stopped by this year when I got into town after 7pm, because I only wanted a glass of wine and some dessert (they had a good chocolate dessert the last time I was here).   I sat at the bar, and after a couple minutes one of the bartenders brought me some water, and I asked for a wine list.  He handed one to me and never came back; just flirted with one of the other bartenders by the register.  I waited for a bit, tried to get their attention a couple of times, and even said \"excuse me\" to one of the managers that walked by behind the bar.  After about 10 minutes or so of indifference I eventually walked out.  It wasn't very late, and they weren't busy, so maybe it's just not a good spot for a middle-aged businessman.  This was truly a first for me.",

    "text": "We looooove Postino's. We love the bruschetta, the brunch, and $5 mimosas on Sunday!!  We sat at the bar and waited for a table 2 Sunday's ago. Got a text that the table was ready, so we are carrying full mimosas to the front so we could be sat. A worker straight up turns around violently and runs into me and I quickly say, \"Sorry!!\"  But instead of him saying sorry back or excuse me or anything, he replies with, \"You're good.\" Ummm, ok lol. You are the one who ran right into me....  Also, whatever this 4 drink per table then you get cut off deal is... I understand the concept and all, but this day my fiance had 3 drinks and I had only had 1, yet we both still get cut off? Trust me, I'm not getting hammered off of 1 mimosa. The server was nice about it and I understand it's not her choice, but really?? Is this a rule for all postinos or just Tempe? Because I have certainly been with a group that was served more than 4 drinks per table at a different location. So after this, we left and went down the street.",

For a Saturday night at 730pm, it wasn't crazy busy, nor was there a wait. I loved the ambiance. It's trendy and cozy and the outdoor seating was great. The bruschetta board that I heard so much about was to die for. Everything on my board tasted fresh and delicious. And I would go back in a heartbeat just for that.  The pub board was also amazing, soft pretzels and mustard were just incredible. I need to go back for brunch. But all in all. Very pleased with this place!",

However, they are good at what they do, and the panini that I had was great. It was different from other paninis that I have had, as it didn't have the grill marks and was made on focaccia bread. Big sandwich, so I'd recommend getting 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad unless you're famished.",

We had a small problem with our order and the truth that everyone makes mistakes - it's how you correct them that makes the difference, came True.  This restaurant went way above and beyond to ensure our experience was not soured.  The one great thing is if you watch the staff - they love their job!  Kudos to ownership and management for creating that environment!  That makes it fun for the diners!!!   AND - of course the food and wine is always fabulous!  Thank you!!!",

I had met up with a friend from out of town and we were catching up, around 10:00 we were asked so many times if we were doing ok. We understand the serving industry, I'm sure our waitress wanted to get off. But we were asked SEVEN times, and it wasn't even close to closing time. Then someone closed the check and brought it to us without our request, it wasn't last call and the kitchen wasn't closing. I couldn't name our server because we were passed off to different people multiple times...In conclusion, we felt rushed to finish our visit and leave.",

They were very professional and made it right. I will definitely be giving them another shot.   We have been wanting to try this place for quite a while. We have heard such good things. We got there and we waited a little. Someone came by to offer us drinks, which is always nice. They were off to a good start. We got to our table and between our group we ordered a panini, salads, bruschetta and olives as an appetizer. We got our drinks first. My husband's soda was flat. We ordered a new one and they never brought it out. Then they brought out our food with the exception of the olives, which were supposed to come out first. We reminded them about the soda and they brought a new (also flat) soda. They said the management was looking into it. We then had the opportunity to point out the olive situation and by the time they brought them out, we were all just about done eating. I think I ate two. We got our check and obviously the soda wasn't on there but they still charged us for our olives and didn't do anything to make up for the fact that they serve flat drinks (after you ask for them a couple times) and bring out your appetizer when you're done eating. Everything we ate was good and if I remember correctly, there's at least one other location. If we try this place again (the food was good) then we will try another location in hopes of better service.",

I want to love this place but the decor for me is better than the food, hands down. I've heard so many people talk about how great their bruschetta is and I've been disappointed every time. The portion is huge and I feel like they lack depth of flavor. For a truly amazing bruschetta, I recommend heading just one block west to La Bocca Pizza and Wine Bar on Mill Ave. I've had their tuna melt before, too, although it was good, I know plenty of other places to get a delicious tuna melt or sandwich (try Ollie Vaughan's in downtown Phoenix).  I've never necessarily been struck by stellar service here, not that it's ever been bad, but I have to point out how incredible our server was the other night. Sanja was absolutely a doll. We waited quite a while to order food and I never once felt like she was irritated or blowing us off. She came around often enough to make sure we each still had a drink and see how we were feeling, without being overbearing. She was sweet, calm, patient, and had a smile on the whole evening, despite the fact that she was clearly very busy (there had been a 20-minute wait). I would probably come back just for her service.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll drop back in unless I'm with friends who insist. Like I said, I would much rather head over to La Bocca a couple hundred yards away. In fact, my experiences here always left me wishing I had gone there instead. Maybe Sanja should see about hopping over there.",

I think I've tried all of them and my absolute favorites are the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato, and Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone. Get a board of four to share. It's a perfect snack or a light lunch.  Only downside is that Postino does not have a full liquor bar, so they unfortunately could not satisfy my craving for a Bloody Mary with brunch. But, they do have champagne for mimosas and their best deal is that all of their beer pitches are $5 from 11am-5pm EVERYDAY!   Postino, please open a location in Tucson!",

    "text": "To preface: Tomato jam. All day. Everyday. That's seriously half the reason I go to Postino!  Used to live near the Arcadia one and got crazy on some $20 bruschetta and wine Monday and Tuesday nights. (Fig one, brie one, tomato jam, and salmon, plz!) Tried this location out about five times since its opening. Food and wine are on point, decor is beautiful. Really nice to see the old ASU art annex revitalized!   But the service is seriously spotty. I've had one good experience out of the five, and the rest suffered from forgotten or wrong wine, plank of bruschetta never arriving because the order wasn't placed, messed up orders, a 45 minute wait for a half empty restaurant. Weird and really spotty service. But really enthusiastic weird and spotty service! I feel like they just a couple seasoned veterans to bring the cute undergrad servers with zero experience up to speed.",

This Postino's fees a lot larger compared to the one in Arcadia and Gilbert which is nice. Hopefully there will never be a wait during lunch as I see us returning often.   Everyone was very friendly, the service was great, love the decor, and the food was fantastic as always. Our waitress even split our checks for us without having to ask.   Now can we have a Federal Pizza in Tempe or Scottsdale too?",

And upon first visit they totally lived up to my expectations.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight. It was pretty busy but we managed to get a good table right away. It's much larger than the original location. We started with the butcher's block, which has a few different kinds of meats, cheeses, nuts and bread. It's all fresh and yummy.   For my meal I got my favorite - the prosciutto and brie sandwich. This is seriously my favorite sandwich anywhere. It has a ton of prosciutto, creamy brie, sweet fig jam and arugula on crusty bread. It doesn't get any better. I also got the mixed greens side salad, which at most places would be really boring but at Postino it's amazingly delicious.  While I may be biased because this location is so close to my house, I have to say I think I like this location even better than the original. It's a very welcome addition to Tempe!",

Came here with co-workers and we were all blown away by the ambiance, food, and drink selections - and that is saying a lot, since we are consultants that travel weekly and eat in restaurants every day.  The bruschetta menu is awesome, two orders feeds 6 people with an appetizer or two. My favorite was the apple-brie-fig spread one, and the guys fell in love with the smoked salmon. Great wine list as well! My only gripe was that my first diet coke that came out had a long cotton string in my ice - weird. They replaced it, but it took about 10 minutes.  The ambiance is very cool, we came when it was pouring rain but it would be great on a nice warm evening. Outdoor seating, and low candle-light. The music is awesome, I'd love to get a hold of the playlist. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Tempe!",

    "text": "Shoehorned between football merch stores and frat bro living is Postino \"Annex\", the name of a restaurant ashamed to admit its presence in Tempe. If you want to see how Postino does Tempe, go now before Annex goes out of business.   Gone is the hip styling of its sister branches, replaced by CPK yellow umbrellas, sickly yellow walls, and off-brand yellow wine lists. Half the wait staff is dedicated solely to filling water glasses. We got 3 glasses of water before seeing a waiter, who had a very special technique of walking past the table, tapping on it, and mumbling a few things while walking away. It wasn't a full house, and he had nowhere to be.  We wanted to leave almost immediately, so we only ordered an appetizer, which arrived an hour later and wrong. \"I'll get you a discount\", said Thomas. We didn't get a discount. While we waited more, I watched him drop food items off the plate and continue to serve them.  It's possible that Postino Annex will be held afloat by the twenty-something omg-gluten-free first-timers, but the young inexperienced staff and janky decor will keep me at the Arcadia location. At least then I can get LGO gelato afterwards instead of an ASU sport polo.",

The staff is really friendly, but you're not designated to one server, so it gets a bit confusing. So much so that we were asked twice by two different people if we wanted another round of drinks, and never received them. That's okay, but not okay when you get charged for them, then when you explain this to someone they look at you like you're just trying to get free stuff.

I haven't had a bad thing there, including all the wines I have tried - they're all stellar choices.  The only thing I worry about is with the huge success of the other two postinos, that this place might become as crowded and jam packed as the other two. Not allowing reservations and waiting forever for seats just kills my wanting to go, so I hope this doesn't happen. But I doubt crossing my fingers will help.",

    "text": "I love this spot! Amazing food (they took off my favorite bruschetta  option though) :( and the prices are fitting in my opinion. Not too expensive and definitely worth it. They have amazing deals too so if you can catch those times then the prices are unbeatable, $20 for a $14 entree and bottle of wine?! Great vibes and great people. I will say that as much as i love it hear I have gotten forgotten about on a few different occasions. Once I had to ask for a server because no one greeted us for the first 15 minutes or so and I had a class to get to in an hour. I can't really know why this happens but I feel like it has to do with the fact that they pull tips and work as a team with all of their guest. It's a great concept however no one server feels as connected and responsible for a table. However I couldn't even be mad because the staff is so friendly that they can talk their way out of anything haha. I know how the industry works and I know how to get around these situations and so do they!  I would say more places should encourage this, being themselves and making conversation is a great way to connect with guests and they won't even care about what just happened. Overall awesome place and highly recommend it:)",

    "text": "Mixed review with this place. The pros are that the paninis are amazing. The cons however, is that we waited a long time for our food. It wasn't even busy and there seemed like there were a lot of employees just standing around or talking to one another. It took about 35 mins to get our food (table of 2). We also had to remind our waitress for refills of water several times since their cups were so small. Then we had to take initiative again to grab the waitress for our bill. Why wasn't she paying attention to us more? Second con, is that they didn't have many choices for food. The menu was very limited. I probably wouldn't come back.",

Granted if you're not in the bar hopping Mill Ave demographic you won't understand how awesome this place is for a good pregame before hitting the night out on Mill. Their happy hour is pretty awesome! $5 glasses of vino or pitcher of beer! Two, their bruschetta! Need I say more? Three, the set up is a little different but the outdoor seating is perfect for groups small or big and the back end of the space is great for small get togethers or parties.",

It's hard to find dog friendly places and even harder to find ones with such excellent service. Little Kahlua is a good judge of character and noticed the friendly attitude of our server Paige who found us a place not too crowded and got both of us waters. She was excellent in offering recommendations, even giving samples of the excellent turkey and bean soup which I settled on with a prosciutto and fig jam sandwich, which was even little k approved. She them recommended the delicious creme brulee. Everything came out fast and even though the restaurant was busy we felt like we were the only ones there as the whole staff especially Paige gave us attention, especially little k. If anyone wants to enjoy an excellent al fresco dinning experience with a little friend then I highly recommend postinos and it's friendly staff especially our server Paige.",

The wait at Snooze was 25 minutes but since Postino looked like it was open for brunch with no wait, we decided to try. Best decision ever! $5 mimosas and the food was fantastic. I eat paleo and easily found a fabulous breakfast called the farm scramble. So good!! Scalloped potatoes, onions and eggs scrambled together with a large side salad of spring mix, cherry tomatoes. and lightly dressed with vinaigrette. It was exactly like a meal I would have made at home. We are so happy we found this place. My husband LOVED his B.E.L.T (breakfast BLT)... Better than snooze (which I still adore but is for maybe less-healthy options)  we cannot wait to return to Postino Annex.",

We went there on a Sunday night. Sat down at the bar, and we were immediately taken care of. We ordered wine by the bottle and not by the glass because in the long run it would be cheaper that way.   Ended up drinking pinot grigio while we were there. The bartender let us taste other samples of wine to see if we liked anything else which was nice of him. Wasn't really a fan of the other wine we drank, so stuck with what we knew.   It wasn't incredibly expensive. Normal wine bar pricing. Good selection of appetizers and small plates. If we weren't full from the food we had earlier, I know we would have tried some. I kind of wish we were hungry so I would have gotten a chance.   Free WiFi here is a plus. It was also nice that the bartender charged my girlfriend's phone behind the bar since they don't have plugs out in the open.   We were told there wasn't really a place in the area with a better environment. That is a True statement. We went to a few other bars down the way a bit later, and those crowds were all 21 year olds. This crowd was more my speed.   I really liked this place, and if I ever come back to the area I'll check it out again (or one it the other locations).",

As a beer drinker I was also pleased with their offerings.   For food, we had the cheese boards, various sandwiches, and salads.

Their $20 bruschetta and wine on Mondays and Tuesday's is one of the best deals around and even though you can almost always expect a wait, it's well worth it.  The bruschetta board is perfect to split and you get to select four different types. My favorite bruschetta are the salmon and pesto, prosciutto with fig & mascarpone, and ricotta with dates and pistachio.   They also have $5 pitchers of beer and glasses of wine during Happy Hour (before 5pm) :)",

EVERY SINGLE once of their bruschettas is amazing. And when I say every single one I mean I've tried every single one. A few of my favorites are the roasted red peppers with goat cheese (the only place I like goat cheese), BURRATA, BACON, ARUGULA & TOMATO (in caps because this is my favorite by far), and and warm artichoke spread. Even though I named only 3 they are all still amazing.   This place has the BEST deal on Monday and Tuesday evenings. A tray of bruschetta and bottle of wine for ONLY $20. You can't beat that price. It's more than enough for 2-3 people to share. If you don't end up finishing all your wine you can cork it and enjoy it at home as well.   Perfect place for date night, girls night, birthdays, just a fun night out with everyone.  The location is also perfect. If you want to go out after on mill it's walking distance.   If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out!",

One little hiccup the waiter did forget to put in my order but that was an honest mistake he apologized provided us with compensation for free food. The staff is very nice. They have speakers outside with misters and they have nice pop hip hop music. Will definitely have to come back again and again and again. Every bruschetta board is to die for I cannot just choose one so enjoy.",

    "text": "My friend wanted to try this place out for her birthday so 6 of us went on a brunch adventure at Postinos.   We went on a Sunday which means all the metered parking is free and it's not too crowded. They offer $5 pitchers of beer on tap and the beer selection is great until 5. With one pitcher, 3 of us all had a delicious milk stout. They also have cheap glasses of wine and a great list.  We decided to sample different boards of the bruschetta and meat/cheese boards. Out of all the bruschetta we tried, my favorite was the salmon. The salmon was so fresh and the flavors popped. The goat cheese on the meat.cheese board was absolute perfection. Great for sharing and the price is great if you are sharing too. If you are not sharing then the prices can be a little on the expensive side  This is a great place to catch up with the girls or just a nice place to hang. Grab a glass and stay classy.",

My colleagues most had the bruschetta board deal (which I understand is quite popular) and the wine special. Since I had overdone a few nights before, I passed on the wine. ;)  I had the tuna sandwich with a side salad which was quite tasty. Our food came out quickly. Service was prompt and professional. Our server was on top of it. My Diet Coke kept filling itself, or so I thought!    I like this place for the atmosphere and the people. The lights we low but not that low that you couldn't see the menu or your friends. The music was cool and so are the people here. The doors were open to the patio and it was a refreshing fall evening. Wish I could have stayed longer but had to work early the next day.   Our checks were split without any issues. They must be used to that being near a college campus and all. I'll be back for sure but won't wait so long between visits. Thanks Postino!  That was fun.",

    "text": "I go out of my way to request off Monday nights from work just so I can spend my Mondays at Postinos for their famous board and bottle night. Just last night, I got to Postinos at 8:30pm and put my name on the list for a party of three, and my other two girlfriends met me about 5-10 minutes after I got sat at the table. My server, Chad, asked me what I wanted to drink and I ordered the Stagedive Pinot Noir, which is what I get almost every time. When he returned, he sat down a single glass of the wine versus the bottle, which is what I had expected to receive, especially since it was  BOARD AND BOTTLE NIGHT. I have been coming to this location for quite awhile and have NEVER had a problem like this before. Coming from a bartender myself, I did not make a big deal of this because I know mistakes and miscommunications happen more than often. I realized I guess I should have clarified what exactly I had wanted, even though it is HIS job to ask if I would like to purchase just a glass or a whole bottle, since after all, they were running a very well known special that night. He poured me a little sample and left the rest of the wine on the side. At that point, I was very confused and maybe thought that they weren't running the board and bottle special that night for whatever reason, and when I asked him, he answered, \"It is board and bottle, but I just rang in a glass since you were by yourself, and thats all I assumed you wanted\" And then he walked away, not  caring that I was clearly unsatisfied. So from my understanding, just because I am by myself I should be treated differently?? I did not drink the wine, and I asked for a whole bottle because that was what I had wanted from the beginning. When a different server brought over all of our bottles, he poured the wine that was on the side (which I was not going to drink because I clearly made it a point that was not what I ordered) into my wine glass. At the end of the night when I got my bill, I was charged the 12$ for the glass of wine on top of the rest of my bill. I do realize that I drank the wine, but I was never intending to since I spoke up right away about the miscommunication. At that point, it could have been corrected and would not have been a problem at all. However, Chad did not do anything but throw it in my face that since I was by myself, I do not get to be apart of the board and bottle special. Like I said before, since I work in the restaurant industry, I still paid and tipped since I know the employees tip share, and I did not find it fair to take money away from the other servers that contributed to my time there, but Chad especially, did not do anything to fix what could have been a simple problem. All in all, I know it is only 12$ at the end of the day, and I know mistakes happen all the time, but it is the way that Chad handled the situation that ruined my experience here.",

We came to Postino Annex in Tempe and had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and informative of the menu and recommendations. I ordered the creamy chicken soup and the quinoa farm salad under the select two option. The soup was warm and flavorful upon arrival, with many different consistencies - I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could also smell the flavors of the soup while I was eating my salad. The salad was great, as well! It was a jam-packed mix of quinoa, greens, bell peppers, cheese, fruits, and a few other things. It had so many flavors and textures as well. The combination of warm soup and fruity salad made my meal very enjoyable. My classmates ordered a variety of things from the select two option also. We all ordered the soup and had no complaints! A classmate ordered the roast beef sandwich and said it was delicious. The meals came very quickly and were brought to us by enthusiastic staff, which made the experience even better. The prices are great for the amount of food and quality that you receive. I ended up paying about $12 for the soup and salad - where one could be replaced for a filling Panini. I will definitely be heading to Postino again in the near future. It's a great option that's so close to campus!",

She was training and was short with us, but I didn't mind. I like to nit pick about service simply because the food is perfect. We always get the bruschetta. It's perfect for two and we switch it up all the time because they are all delicious. The bread is insane, so soft and fresh.

This seems to be more of a college hangout for wine-time and a classy atmosphere. Although this wasn't the \"elegante ristorante italiano\" I had expected, don't let this lead you to believe that it isn't worth the stop, because what it lacks with it's less-than-extensive menu and hip rather than fancy atmosphere it more than makes up for it with EXTREMELY tasty food. My wife and I shared a bruschetta board that was to die for, bringing light and savory flavors into a perfect balance. We both got a panini for our entree and was also very impressed in freshness and in the originality of their recipes. Bottom line: don't go to Postino Annex if you are expecting a formal (quiet) setting for dinner, but if you are okay hanging out with a bunch of college kids getting their fancy on, by all means check it out, the food won't disappoint.",

Eggs mixed with roasted potatoes, arugula salad and ripe cherry tomatoes and it was perfect for brunch. I don't even like tomatoes but these were great, let's just say my plate was empty. My friends got the bruschetta and it was great, lot of food though so maybe 2 people should share. A lot of options with the bruschetta and they're great. I got the Bellini too and it was perfect, no joke I've never had one and its better than the mimosa. Good vibes and good food, highly recommend.",

Upon arrival, there was a 25 min wait to be seated, but there were tables available.. lots of tables available. These sections were also being waited on so I was quite confused.. whatever, we wait waited. When we were finally seated, it took 15 mins for our waiter to come over. He took our order, and after 45 mins our food finally came. We ordered bruschetta and salad. Why did it take 45 mins?! Our waiter never came back after that. We had to go ask another server for the check. Overall, lunch took about 2 hours. Will definitely skip Postinos next time and go to La Bocca.",

I've been to this location and the one in Gilbert and I would have to say that this location is my favorite.  I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning to meet up with some people a little after nine. They arrived before me and apparently most, if not all of the patio seating outside had already been taken. If that doesn't speak for how popular Postino's is then I'm not sure what does. They have a good food list for brunch as well - ordered the Country Toast which was excellent with portions bigger than expected. As for their wines they are simply stellar. You can tell that they have an extensive tried and tested wine list and it definitely shows.  The service here is really good. The people working here are very friendly and helpful willing to give you suggestions on what to try. I really enjoy every visit to Postino's and I look forward to coming back!",

Had the Nine Iron, it's good just as good as Arcadia but the locations and feel just isn't quite right.  The other locations seem more intimate, but there feels like a real premium on real estate exists at the \"annex\".     You could do much worse in the Mill Ave area, but I'm reviewing against the other Postinos.",

Anyway, we each got a glass of wine and the server was really fun, telling us how they all have to go through a training something like once a month and taste all the wines on the menu. Sounds like a tough job. So she gave us good guidance on what to order. We then placed a food order - 2 boards of bruschetta (pretty much ordered every option except for the one with mushrooms) and a kale salad. Love the bruschetta, hands down the best in the valley. Always full of topping and the bread is soft and delicious. The salad was good as well. Overall had fun and enjoyed this new location.",

More importantly he never asked me to change my original review.  Hopefully they clear the staff out and start over, as the environment is pretty nice!  Just meh. Basically an overpriced soup and salad place. We had a large group. And they were kind enough to give us separate tickets. However, when you tell your server you're starving, order, and over an hour later the food comes--and its half the size you expect with a shotglass of soup, and she doesn't correct you when you ask her what size to order--now, it definitely is not surprising that we had not seen our server in that hour.  When we initially sat down she took our drink orders--and it took 20 minutes to get drinks!!!! Mind you our whole group hadn't arrived and the place wasn't even close to packed--completely absurd.  Due to the fact we hadn't seen her, several of us had to go directly to the bar for our refills on beer/wine!  Really unfortunate--as this does have a neat location.",

I'll admit I wasn't quite sure what was on my plate because my cousin ordered first, and whatever she said sounded awesome, so I told the waitress I wanted the same lol. And I was not disappointed! Also had a glass of Pinot Noir that I liked quite a bit, and I usually don't care for any wine that isn't pretty sweet.  It's a trendy little red-bricked joint right next to Snooze, another favorite of mine. I wouldn't take kids there. I doubt anything on the menu is going to appeal to a child's palette.",

The bruschetta is very filling and so delicious, the staff is wonderfully friendly and accommodating, and the wines are delicious!! The most amazing thing is you can choose from ANY of the wines on the wine list!! INSANE!!  I went with a party of four and we got 2 board and bottle deals, a cup of soup, and a chefs board. All of it was awesome!  We got a bottle of malbec and a bottle of prosecco. I don't like red wine, but the malbec was delicious. The prosecco was also spectacular, as was the cava I tasted. I love that they allow you to taste the wines before ordering.  The bruschetta was also very impressive. My favorite was the apple, brie, honey. Also love that they allow you to get it on tomato slices to accommodate low-carb diets.  The chefs board was great and was served with dried cherries, which was a wonderful treat since usually all you get is cranberries or other cheaper dried fruit alternatives. The cherries were a great touch and the goat cheese was delicious!  Can't wait to return. The ambiance can't be beat and the deal is too good to be True!",

    "text": "Let me preface this very long review with the fact that I generally love Postino. I have been to the Gilbert location several times and the Tempe location a couple times. I am familiar with their wait times and their general practices.   That said, I recently had the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time. I was meeting three of my friends and got to the location about ten minutes early (at 6:20) to get my place in line for the wait - asked for five people since I thought someone was bringing a plus one. I was told there would be a 30-45 minute wait simply because they were limited in booths that could fit five people. When my friend got there about ten minutes later she changed my reservation to four people, thinking it would take less time (and because she wasn't bringing a plus one). We waited until 7:15 to get seated - and watched as literally everyone else (including others that we thought were there after us) got seated before us. Not a single other group was waiting by the time we got seated. To do the math - this was an hour wait, nearly double what we were told.   We were finally seated at one of the booths reserved for five people. Our waitress came promptly and took our drink order. She ask if we were ready to order and we needed one more minute (arguing over types of bruschetta - which we should have done over the hour wait lol). She told us she would bring our drinks right back and we can order then.   We waited and watched our waitress walk by at least three or four times, going to other tables. We watched the bartender stand there looking at a clipboard doing nothing. Finally ten minutes later (no exaggeration) we watched our waitress walk over to the computer system and put in our drinks. By the time the bartender made them, it was a good 15 minutes or so later.... and someone else was assigned to bring our drinks. So there was no putting in an order as the waitress had suggested. We waited a while longer and she finally came around to put in our order. We had been waiting an awful lot at this point.  Order 1: Bruschetta (all meat ones), two cups of soup. Order 2: Bruschetta (all vegetarian), one cup of soup. Order 3: Panini   So quite a bit later the all meat bruschetta comes out with one single cup of soup - slightly confusing based on our order. We never got water refills the entire time. Over several minutes this was eaten entirely while we were (you guessed it) waiting for anyone else's food to arrive. I had been watching to see who the manager was because I was planning on asking for him/her just to explain our situation at this point (I never do this).   The man I perceived to be the manager (bald head, dark beard) finally walked up with two cups of soup. We were worried that perhaps they forgot to put in the other orders or they got mixed up. My friend asked as he was giving us the soup (in a very nice tone might I add - my friend was not rude at all) if we also had a bruschetta board and panini. THE MANAGER LITERALLY SAID: It's up in the window - I only have two hands. The way he said 'I only have two hands' literally hit me the wrong way. It was rude, uncalled for, and just plain terrible customer service. I decided not to speak with him. It was the straw that broke the camel's back.   The waitress took a long time to get our checks, a box, and take the check, and then some other random person brought it back for us. On the way out, the manager and hostess were standing at the entrance. Neither of them said 'have a good night' until my friend said it first (again he was not rude at all).   I will not be going back to Postino Tempe again. Worst customer service I have EVER received and I would expect much better from a manager. I'm pretty sure I could go to Denny's and be treated better. Like I am seriously so pissed I am not going there ever again.   TWO STARS ONLY BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AS USUAL.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came in for dinner on a Sunday and we were more than halfway done with our food, when across from us in a booth were two old people who would not stop sucking face. I told the guy who refilled our water if he could tell them to get a room and he quickly walked away without saying anything. We waited for a bit thinking he was grabbing someone else for us. He didn't.   So I flagged down (a waiter?) Christian, who actually told me \"this is a romantic setting, just don't look at it\" and stormed off without letting me reply (he made it really tempting to storm off w/o paying). At this point, it's obvious Christian has no idea what good customer service or romance are. He offered to move us but I was nearly done with my food, and besides, I expected Postino's to be a classier establishment. Two people making out and getting handsy for an excessive amount of time kills a restaurant vibe (and my appetite), but I'm not in the food industry so who knows.. And no, nobody else complained because we were the only other customers in that corner of the restaurant who could see it.  I understand this isn't an everyday occurrence, but I was exercising my right as a customer to tell management why I'm not having a 100% great dining experience. If they tell me they can't/won't do anything, I understand that I don't have to continue eating there. What really disappointed me now was Christian's lousy behavior.  Christian also failed to grab the manager, which you're supposed to do when a customer has a complaint, so when our waiter comes by I ask HIM to bring over the manager. By now I'm 99% done with my food and the old people had been going at it for about 20 minutes.  Manager comes by and tells us \"sorry but we can't say anything to them if they're not being handsy\" to which I replied \"they are!\" Manager did not acknowledge this nor Christian's rude behavior when I told him what Christian said/did to us. When I finally said I don't think I'll be returning to this location because this overtly sexual behavior is okay here, he left to go grab a ticket for ONE free entree to give to the TWO of us in hopes we keep returning to this location. Between the uninterested manager and X-tian, I think another location will be worth the drive.  ALSO, the tomato/mozzarella bruschetta is way too salty. I get it every time and need to wipe it down with my finger or it'll taste like pure salt.",

Tonight I dropped 3 people at 7:45-7:50 while I parked the car ($6 for 2 hours). When I got to the restaurant the 3 were still standing in a line that was going out the door.  Why?  The hostesses were \"staggering the seating so we don't overwhelm our waitstaff\".  So, the empty patio was not being filled.  Group after group walked up to put in their name, and then left when they realized they'd be waiting a long time due to this policy.  We put in our name, but decided to leave when their text message alert told me there were 10 parties ahead of us-- with a nearly empty patio.    Last week I left a Yelp Tip saying the service had been great once we convinced them to let us be seated on the patio.  The manager was afraid it would rain last time.  It didn't rain, of course. The length they have made us go through two weeks in a row to be seated when the tables are empty is unacceptable.  Clearly, others felt the same way, as many people turned and left tonight.   2 stars for the nice waitstaff we had last week.  Zero stars for the bizarre seating system that leaves customers standing and waiting while tables sit empty.  Ever consider bringing in more staff on nights when you have the wine special, or does that make too much sense?",

My fave was the goat cheese and red pepper. I had the Hannah salad; it was so fresh and funky. I also had the brie panini; I did the pick 2 option- great deal. The service was awesome! So friendly, but not like annoyingly attentive.",

And honestly the ingredients made me not wanna order it at all. The food took way too long to come and one from our group had to just do a go to box because she had come during her lunch hours. The boards were very delicious tho although $15 a board felt a bit too expensive to me. When I ordered something mistakenly non vegetarian they were nice enough to not charge us for it so an extra star for that!",

A whole bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for 15 is a steal, also do not worry you will be full after. The staff is so cool and friendly too! I recommend sitting outside at night because the atmosphere is so lovely. Their music and lights outside really just create such a wonderful environment. You need to go here if you are in Tempe or go to ASU! Def a deal for a college kid balling on a budget.",

The Brie was incredibly salty which I didn't like very much :(   However I tried some of my friend's orange scone with salted butter and apricot jam ($4) and it was SO GOOD. Flaky and light and fluffy and delicious :)   I'd try Postino again but I just didn't think my dish was special or particularly good.",

    "text": "Great food and service. Thanks for all the Yelpers for the accurate reviews that drew us to this restaurant in the first place. Christian, our waiter confirmed that we needed to order the 4 for $12.50 Bruschetta board. We ordered the green apple and brie, prosciutto with fig, salmon and capers plus the burata and bacon. Our waiter had the chef cut each into 4 bites so that our party of 4 could sample the rainbow. Chef also ordered the bruschetta from most subtle to the most robust flavors. It was divine. The green apple and brie was flavorful and refreshing, delivering a nice zip and creaminess. Next, the prosciutto and fig was sweet and salty. The salmon was topped with salty-sour capers and finely chopped purple onion. Finally, the burata and bacon was amazing with finely chopped crispy bacon and tomatoes.   We also ordered the chicken and mozzarella panini on ciabatta bread with chips, and the 9 Iron on foccacia with salad. Wow, the paninis are also delicious. Chef cut the sandwiches and plated them in halves for the 4 of us. The chicken and mozzie was good, but not as great as the Nine Iron. The combination of meats and sauces was perfect with the toasted foccacia. We also loved the salad delicately dressed served with toasted pine nuts. The homemade wavy fries were good with the spicy mayo dip which Christian kindly brought out.  We were nicely satisfied with the amount of food we ordered. All this for under $45 including tip. We were all sorry that my husband did not join us this meal and are determined to introduce him to the Postino experience. Thank you Christian and the Postino Annex team.",

They have spectacular happy hour specials.  You get a mini pitcher of beer for $5.  There was at least 2 pints of beer in the pitcher.  Killer deal.  The glasses of wine were all $5 too.  Which is more than 50% off most of the glasses.  The happiest of happy hours.   The food was excellent.  The menu was small but everything was on point.  We started with the butchers block and 8 of their bruschettas.  All of them were good.  I repeat ALL of them were good. I didn't even get to try some of them because they flew off the plates.   For my entree I got the \"pick two\" with a Brussels salad and their soup of the moment.  The soup was a coconut, carrot, curry.",

My favorite salad went away a while ago (Italian picnic) but the Brussels sprout salad and the nicoise (served deconstructed so you can make your own perfect bite) totally make up for it. The grilled cheese is also yummy. The beer and wine lists are good and glasses of wine and pitchers (just under two pints) are $5 before 5:00. They don't advertise it but you can get a half order of almost anything (not the nicoise). I usually  get a half salad and a single bruschetta (or two). They also have nightly specials like a bottle and board for $20. The servers can be a bit aloof sometimes and waits at peak times are long but those are the only downsides.",

The brunch menu isn't as extensive as I hoped, but everything we ordered was tasty and we didn't have to wait over an hour to be seated.  The wine and bruschetta deal on Monday and Tuesday seems awesome and I will be back to try it out!",

You can't go wrong with any of them. I would also highly recommend their Brussels spout salad as well as any soup they make. And they WINE is soooo tasty!! I recommend I recommend!",

One thing I would suggest is \"read your table\"- it's one thing to be upbeat and gregarious with a group of women that are laughing and giggling and another to be a bit overbearing with women that are having a serious conversation that you interrupt. And it wasn't our waiter, it was another young man that was browsing the crowd and checking on the patrons.  Other than that, I will return to try their Tuesday night deal.",

I ordered their mimosa and french toast, which was delicious. My boyfriend got the plate of 4 bruschetta: smoked salmon, salami, tomato mozzarella, and BLT. After seeing his plate, I kind of regretted my decision of getting breakfast instead of lunch, but at least he shared. I even ended up ordering one extra BLT bruschetta--so good!  My friends and boyfriend shared a few pitchers of beer, which comes with enough beer for 2 glasses (I assume around 32 oz). All pitchers of beer and wine are $5 before 5 pm! We were very impressed with their drink specials and their yummy food. We probably would have come back here if we stayed another day in Arizona!",

It made me feel like I was in college again. A group of us went after watching a sporting event at ASU in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. When we arrived, our waiter (who had large earrings with the symbol for the resistance - Star Wars - printed on them and prominently displayed), was extremely helpful and we asked him to bring out whatever bruschetta boards he thought we would prefer. His choices were phenomenal!  I wish I recalled the name of the bruschetta boards he brought us, but I'll try to describe what was on them. The one with small pieces of bacon, and the one which was reminiscent of lox were my two favorites. 5/5. There was also one with a form of fruit jam on it which was incredibly tasty. 5/5. The usual suspects with salami, apple, and other assorted fruits were also very tasty when paired with some of the excellent beers they have on tap. 5/5.  If you're down in Tempe, I highly recommend that you check out this Postino. It's located near the ASU swim complex, and just south of the football stadium. The atmosphere alone is worth the visit!",

I came here with two friends and we ordered two Bruschetta boards, which was more than enough for the 3 of us (I was with two girls, so if you roll in with a party of guys, err on the side of ordering more).  To all other restaurants out there: THIS is Bruschetta done right.  On each board, they give you the option of four different types of bruschetta, and each bruschetta is a sizable portion (~6 inch) divided into anywhere between 4-6 slices.  With 8 of their overall 12 types of bruschetta sitting on the table, I can't recall a single type that I didn't like. Moreover, they keep a seasonal piece available, giving you an even better reason to come back.   I highly recommend the Prosciutto for the meat lovers, the Salmon for the pescetarians, and the brie apples with fig for the straight-up vegetarians, as they were all my favorite :) they were all quite tasty and unique though, so do give them all a worthy chance!   This place comes highly recommended by many in the Phoenix area, and for good reason.  It makes me sorely regret the numerous times I turned down this place while I was a student at Arizona State University.  Postino will have to await my return visit before I reward them with star #5.",

    "text": "I have to tell you, I just came back from Europe and boom, seems like Europe is in Tempe, with the opening of places like the Postino Annex. I love that they created this in a brick building right off of the ASU annex and the whole space is open and inviting with that quality of food and service that by now, is an expected characteristic of the Positno's brand. I had the eggs, bacon and Walnut toast brunch option (that also came with thinly sliced and well crisped fingerling potatoes and onions). I joked with my neighbors that I would dock them a star for not carrying Tabasco but the food was so good that I didn't need any extra kick to it.    For drinks I tried the cucumber and honey lemonade which is $3 and is bottomless (they kept filling it up discretely, part of that excellent service they are known for. I also split a $5 pitcher of micro-brew - any of their beers on draft (and they have a nice selection, local and other craft brews and even a traditional mass produced light beer which I will not comment on but they cater to all tastes, even bad ones (humor!). The view from the patio or the edge of the patio (we sat right on the indoor side to take advantage of the AC) is wonderful - with a stunning view of the mosque, it's golden dome shining in the sun, and with church bells tolling, I assume from the local Catholic Church. I can't wait to go at night and see the house lights, which look just lovely.   As my neighbor noted, they don't do huge portions but what they do, is done well so I'm sure I'll come back over and over again - especially for those $5 pitchers of beer and yes, probably a bottle of wine at times, especially on Monday when they have a plank and a bottle of wine for $20  (good deal!).   Not much else to say except that this is another shining cultural star in the rapidly developing 85281 area code. I expect that when the Rio Salado development is done this place will be as packed as another of the other more seasoned Postino's locations so make sure to get here now so you can enjoy it in a less crowded atmosphere. :-)  Oh, for bike parking, the easiest thing to do is to go across the street to the ASU building where they have lots of good bike racks or you can connect it to up the fence or to one of the wrought iron balustrades around the trees in front of the restaurant.",

The Phoenix and Gilbert locations are always crowded with hipsters and trendy families and I wanted nothing with these places.   And then I got taken to the one in Tempe for lunch...twice!!!  And I really liked the food both times.  So there, I was wrong.  The bruschetta and the salad I had were delicious.  And the staff was pleasant, and took very good care of us.  And they have a patio, which I love.   In my defense, the crowd in the Tempe location is more in my style...(just joking, I have no style, I'm just boring/bland).",

Oh my lord they have the best chill music choice of any place I've been to in the area. The outdoor patio is nicely designed as is the interior, giving off an upscale feel while still allowing some room for the casual. I can't wait to return for brunch and to try one of their mimosas!",

We were already having a good time, so we didn't even realize the time, but this was a fantastic gesture. The food is always amazing here and the service was out of site.  Our waiter sort of disappeared the last 20-30 minutes or so though, which was weird. We had to ask 3 different people for the ticket. Not huge, but weird.

    "text": "I recently visited Postino Annex located in the heart of Downtown Tempe, just a few blocks from the iconic Mill Avenue, Postino Annex is nestled into the old Arizona State art building, according to the placard out front.  The restaurant is built from brick and has colored concrete floors, it has a truly amazing feel to it from the second you step inside. I visited the restaurant and was immediately greeted by the host who had brought me to my table. She informed me that waters would be followed up shortly, and she was not lying, I received my water as I sat down and it was cold as can be, which is extremely refreshing after walking around campus. I had a wonderful server by the name of Sarah, she was witty and charming. She recommended the happy hour special, which I would also strongly recommend, you can select any pitcher of beer or glass of wine off their list for $5, yes you read that right five freaking dollars for a whole pitcher of beer. How could you not enjoy a nice Devil's Ale whilst sitting on the beautiful campus that Arizona State truly is. The patio featured yellow umbrellas (yellow is the company's signature color) and extra large awnings to shield you from the brutal Arizona sun. The company also features a large glass garage door that can be opened to give the restaurant a super open feel to it. After I had gotten settled in Sarah recommended the bruschetta board. Once again a great recommendation. I went with the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Sweet and Spicy Pepper Jam with Goats Milk Cheese, Brie and Apple with Fig Spread, and lastly the Salami and Pesto. (it sounds very plain but packs a full flavor.) The food arrived and it looked truly amazing, I wish I had thought to take a picture before I had devoured it (There's ton of pictures on yelp so look at those). Food was priced very modestly for the quality of food. A select two combo meal (soup, sandwich, salad) is only $10.50, so I will definitely be back to try that on my lunch breaks. I only had one problem with this restaurant and in no way is their fault so I wont knock them for it. But my biggest issue is parking, there is absolutely no way to park for free or get your parking validated so be ready to pay $6 extra dollars to eat (unless you go on the weekend in which parking garages are free.). As I was preparing to finish up my meal I had noticed there was dessert on the menu, and how could I pass up that amazing opportunity. The three desserts offered were Chocolate Bouchon (lava cake), Creme Brulee, and a Salted Caramel Sundae. I ordered the Bouchon and I could not have been happier with my decision. I could not finish it all because of how rich the chocolate was, but the ice cream as I was informed came from one of the company's other concepts, an dessert shop in central Phoenix called Churn, I will definitely be visiting there in the future.",

The person on the phone told us don't take reservation for parties under 8 but there is \"plenty\" of open table and we shouldn't have a problem. We went and there at 5:30pm and encounter a 45min wait because they have a party of 100 people in the back.  Really? you didn't know about this and couldn't understand that it would be limited seating and busy...especially on a Friday night? We went to the bar while we waited and had a few drinks. Bartenders were excellent: curious, fast, etc. I noticed quite a few open tables on the patio even one right behind us.  We also noticed a table for 3 had a reservation sign on it and yup 3 people walked in and were sat at that table...no reservations for parties under 8...that's BS. We finally got our table after a 40min wait and you guess it, it was the open table right behind us. jeez, we could have been seated there to begin with. It was open the whole time. The waiter came over and asked us if we wanted to order something, we told him to give us a few minutes to look over the menu. He came back 10min later and we ordered food. A sandwich and bruschetta...simple enough. He disappeared.  Another server/staff asked if we wanted water; took over 10min to get. Yet another 10min goes by and we wanted to order more drinks , waiter wasn't around.  He way busy chatting with other tables. We saw another server and asked if he could get our waiter so we can order drinks. He said they are team servers and anyone could get us drinks, food, etc....strange concept.  He brought back our drinks....still no main waiter to be found and never checked on us. Our food took 40min to get to us...way to long for something simple. It was served by yet another waiter. After the food was delivered, our initial waiter asked us if it looked ok and then disappeared again...never to be seen by us till we complained later on.  We wanted more drinks, and no one was around to wait on us. We decided it wasn't worth staying and looked for our waiter to get our bill. Again, he was at the same 2 table chatting and flirting for 8 minutes. I went to the hostess and asked for someone to get our bill. She was surprised our waiter didn't attend to us. Our waiter came to our table and asked what was wrong. After we explained the poor service he said\" I'm sorry you feel that way\"....REALLY? how about \"sorry, I screwed up and forgot about you\". He acted like he did nothing wrong. We gave him gift cards to pay the bill. Then the manager came over and wanted to understand the problem. We explained everything, she apologized, cited the big party (which is a bad excuse) and said she would comp the bill, which was nice. She explained the \"team server\" process they used and said it sometimes doesn't work the best but they are trying. I think they should go back to 1 server per table and crew member to support food delivery and cleaning tables, filling water, prepping (like most restaurants do). Overall it was one of the worst experiences we had at a restaurant in a while and wrecked the mood for the night. We won't be going back to this place.  It was very disappointing since we read so many good reviews about this place online.",

We saw our server stumble out of the restaurant and head home. 20 minutes later, a different server appeared and dropped the check - no communication whatsoever.

Our visit to Postinos Annex resulted with an Oasis of calm in a fresh environment where everything was in sync. We were greeted promptly, seated and allowed to settle in to gauge our surroundings.  Contrary to parties being stacked too closely, various seating arrangements are employed. An openness conducive to extended patronage, and opportunity to sample delightful fare.  The food elevates the mood as myriad and distinct flavors complement preparation found to be attentive.  The staff executed in harmonious fashion without any measure of pretension. There was even the odd oops behind counter where glassware hit floor. Acoustics muted the impact preserving a measure of serenity.  Involved parties joined together to recover.  When it was time to leave Postinos, there was a bit of sadness (it was going to get toasty outside that day. JK). Seriously, the dining experience and food were great; morning beverages also spot on. Looking forward to returning. Wonder what's for dessert?",

I Stopped in today before my flight back to Atlanta for the bruschetta. I had the apple & brie and prosciutto, goat cheese. They were delicious! Talisa is the best server I've ever had! She was so sweet & attentive & you can tell she loves people & her job. She is AWESOME!",

When we asked to have one \"replaced\" with what we really ordered, it was delivered quickly only to find out we were charged for their mistake!  Really!  That is wrong!  The food certainly was not as good as the Gilbert location.",

We went before 5pm, so the glasses of wine were only $5. The bruschetta was to die for and my husband loved the butcher's board. The service was great and I felt like we were well taken care of!",

But regardless of where i am, i seem to always receive AMAZING service! I love that the servers , no matter what questions i ask, are knowledgeable about everything that they serve and are able to give great insight for recommendations. Ours recommended what they've nicknamed \"cougar juice\" and it was  divine. Regardless of whether they're packed, you're going to get on point service. This is the place to be if you want a place with a relaxing ambiance, good food, and great service",

We never went without a drink and they were both extremely welcoming and exciting to serve us. 10/10 should recommend this restaurant and I personally recommend the nine iron sandwich or the B.E.L.T.",

Food was very good and fresh, the cucumber lemonade was outstanding. Servers were the best. Call outs to Dirk & Kiera - they really made us feel welcome and want to come back the next time we are in town. Kudos to management for encouraging servers to talk to customers - seems simple, but often overlooked. We will come back for the people and good food & drink.",

The sandwiches were great and the $5 pitchers of micro-brew beer for happy hour (starting at 3pm) made it even better. But the best part of all was the outstanding service, our water was constantly being refilled and there were periodic checks by staff to see that everything was ok.  If I could give them 6 stars I would.  We are from Riverside, CA and will definitely stop here again when we come into town.",

We got the fig & cheese, traditional, smoked salmon &  capers, and bacon burrata ....all of which were delicious! Wonderful service and funny staff. Definitely will be back!",

    "text": "I'm lucky enough to have an office walking distance from Postino and therefore order lunch-to-go quite frequently. From placing the order to picking it up, I have never had a bad experience at Postino. The staff is always so welcoming and cheerful and my food is always delicious and ready to go when I arrive. Unless I'm in for the bruschetta board and bottle of wine deal on Mondays, I'm usually ordering the prosciutto and Brie panini on ciabatta with a side salad and it is seriously a delicious lunch. I've tried the Turkey panini and didn't find it to be very interesting so I defaulted back to the prosciutto and Brie because it never fails. Usually I feel as though the bread could be more toasted so I asked for my panini to be a little more toasted this time and it was literally perfect. If you're looking for a delicious place for a classy sandwich or some seriously delicious and giant bruschetta, with a fun ambiance, I definitely recommend Postino, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "this is more a comment than a review--I love Postinos.  I live in a neighborhood where I can walk to one--I have to say that I like mine a lot better than the one in Tempe--I get it--I am not the target demographic for the Tempe location.  Nonetheless--the kinetic energy that is the service went from ---oh great service to leave us the f**** alone--Either put water pitchers on the table or put signs on the table that can be flipped--water no water--the amount of interruptions was overwhelming until you actually needed  something.  in addition to water being poured every three minutes, was the individual clearing of the little carafes for wine or a single fork or plate that wasn't used.  Individual pieces cleared every time a server came by.  If you want to turn the tables at break neck speed at this location just say so--and let me manage my time--tell me you want me to gone in 30 minutes--I get it--and will respectthat-the kinetic service was really disruptive to conversation and time with a good friend.  Will I be back?  Probably--but I am bringing signs the next time so I can clearly communicate when I need/want service and when I want to sit and enjoy my wine and the conversation at the table without constant interruption     On another note--as with the other Postinos--it is a great looking restaurant and the food is always enjoyable.",
