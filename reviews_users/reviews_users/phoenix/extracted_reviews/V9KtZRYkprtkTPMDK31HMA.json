Anyway, went with family and had a seat on patio. Smokers everywhere like most bar patios. Really too bad but we managed. Had the wings, tacos, chips and salsa and was pleasantly suprised. Actually, the menu is way above bar standard. As The patio music ended, the music inside was starting. You can see the owner they take pride in food and music  which is why this place will make it.",

    "text": "Friday Happy Hour.  Good sized crowd but not all the tables were full.....was able to park close to the door....not bursting at the seams, not crazy-busy.  Food was good but not great.  Had boneless wings, nachos, and 5 kinds of bruschetta at the table.  Wings were good but dipping sauces were sad (cilantro lime crema had no flavor beyond crema; pub cheese dip had fantastic smoked cheddar flavor followed by what tasted like a belch of hot Guinness in your throat...definitely awful); bruschetta was well made but not always well conceived..... sometimes flavors did not go together as well as one might have imagined.  Nachos were only half eaten.  Service was terrible.  One in our party ordered lemonade and it took 15 minutes to get to the table.  Bleu cheese dipping sauce never made it to the table even with 2 reminders.  Asked for a fork and napkin; was never brought either; ended up using someone else's napkin when she had done with it.  I have to comment on the uniforms worn by the female employees.  I understand the spirit of the outfits, a-la Hooters.  Not all bodies are made for booty shorts and tank tops, and no respectable boss should expect their 45-looks-like-60 year old bartender to wear them with pigtails.  From a distance of maybe 50 feet, she looked like a cute 23 year old.  Up close she looked like the Cryptkeeper.  I'm sure she's a crackerjack bartender; please let her wear something age appropriate.  While we didn't feel a strong negative about the place, we generally agreed we would probably spend our happy hours elsewhere.",

Our server took our drink orders, brought us our drinks and then disappeared. 45 minutes later I turned around and saw him drinking at the table behind us with his buddies. Apparently he was no longer working. I went inside to find a new server. She was not interested in serving us so I went to the bar. The bartender took our food order and 30 minutes later delivered cold, tasteless and soggy food.  She also refreshed our drinks. Two hours later, we weren't sure if we needed to pay for the food and drinks or if we were just supposed to leave. I went inside to ask for our tab and no one knew what was going on. Don't know why this place has four stars.   UPDATE: Upon reading my review one of their drunken employees sent me a threatening message full of homophobic remarks.",

Waited a few mins (no problem) for a table even though we see a few tables open, was told they were under staffed, which was concerning. But when we sat down at our table, we waited about 10 to 15 mins for service, which was upsetting and ruined the mood in trying out the new place. We were ready to leave but stuck it out. What was frustrating was the waitress serving the two tables surrounding us plainly ignored us since it was not her assigned table.   Well finally we got service after we called out and grab one of employees. Ordered our food n beer, but the waitress did not know the type of beers on the menu and did not tell us only certain beers were on their happy hour special. We unluckily found out when we got our check. I wasnt expecting much off but it was during the happy hr.  Anyway got our burgers we ordered, after waiting about 30mins and we had too ask our surrounding waitress to check on it cause our assigned waitress was hardly around.  My burger was good, fries were good, no complaints. My partner's burger was under cooked and did not want to finish.  Luckily the Manger stopped by for a greet and took it off the bill.  We well try to go there again, since it's in our neighborhood, but probably sit at the bar only for hopefully better service.",

There's a huge family (old and young alike) having a Birthday Party!!! How cool to have a Neighborhood Hot- Spot that can make everyone feel right-at-Home. Love this patio!! Sometimes the games on, but it's awesome after a long day at work just to relax, mood lighting from the trees ~ just the right company... For the record every night there's something for everyone: *Mon-Wed ~ Solo Music Act (kinda chill stuff) *Sun&Thu ~ Jam Session (Open with Charli's Live   Band) *Fri&Sat ~ Headliner Bands And that's just the music!!!  *Sidewalk Art Sales every week *Balloon maker for the kids!!! Now onto the food: tonight i had a Barbacoa beef taco. Spicy beef guacamole, lettuce, onions, queso fresco topped with cilantro lime crema... for the low, low price of $3!!! My friend always has the White fish tacos - blackened or grilled. I've also had the Surfin' Safari Pizza - sausage, pepperoni Canadian bacon and pineapple and the most incredible sauce!! Only $14. For being a new place they've found a comfortable groove. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and fun - tonight was Danielle & Alicia, but Hannah, Donnie and Myria are all awesome!!! I highly recommend GTC ~ Thanks so much Charli and Family... and welcome to the Neighborhood!!!",

Live music just about every night with a stage positioned where most will be able to see it and numerous TVs.  The owner Charlie and her Manager were very attentive and took the time to talk and meet us even though the place was very busy.

We each had a breakfast skillet and were very pleased. Tons of white meat chicken and very savory.  Loved the decor, especially the liquor bottle lights. Very cool. Service was good. Had a few people waiting on us. Not the warmest but they got the job done.  We are hoping this place sticks around! Reading past reviews I hope they can get their service issues fixed, even though we had a fine experience! Go Charli's! P.S. My only complaint is smoking on the patio. We would've loved to sit outside as it was a gorgeous day, but can't stand cigarette smoke while trying to eat. That's just me!",

My favorite item on the lunch menu is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich which, at only $6, is a delicious, smoking deal.  I do not want to know what they put on their delectable Rustic Potatoes because if it is heroin (as I suspect) then I'll need to go to rehab where they will definitely not serve that side.    A bartender at another establishment that I frequent recommended GTC for music and a server at a different bar mentioned she liked to hang out at GTC as well.  Now, if industry people are into the GTC night scene I thought I should give it a try.  I arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night and managed to get a seat at the bar.  Ariana was kind and patient with a stranger who was not familiar with the beer list.  The people around me were very open to including me in their conversations, and the wings were crispy, juicy tenderness.  The massive beer list lends itself to a variety of palates and the mixed drinks looked impressive.    As Fett's Law so aptly states, \"Never replicate a successful experiment.\" But who am I kidding; I know I will be back for more of the wonderful food, beer, music, and banter.",

Multiple staff came up to our table asking if we were being helped so there were definitely enough staff for the people in the bar. I'm wondering if the kitchen was understaffed.

    "text": "Stopped in for the first time for Thursday Night Football. Great ambiance and a good crowd on a Thursday night. The live music was a plus. Beer was cold, food came out hot. We had the wings and pizza; wings were good, pizza was good but greasy. Only real complaint was with the Happy Hour pricing- website advertises $1 off all beer/wine, $10 wings. We were charged full price for the beer and $12 for the wings. When we questioned the price, we were told that the $1 off only applied to domestic drafts and the Happy Hour wing price was for a half-dozen and we had ordered a dozen. Except the half-dozen is only $6 at regular menu price, so... Charging more for Happy Hour?  Or maybe the Happy Hour changed and the website wasn't updated? Anyway, we will definitely be back to give it another try.",

    "text": "I'd like to give this place a better review because it looks like they are trying to be successful. The decor is outstanding and ambiance is perfect for a nicer bar setting. My husband and I visited during the lunch hour and took over an hour and a half from beginning to end. This is unacceptable if this establishment expects to cater to someone on their lunch break. The server was friendly but hardly prompt. Our drinks were empty longer than they should've been and my chicken sandwich looked and tasted like an old piece of cardboard-like chicken had been sitting around and the cook dropped in in some hot oil and put it on a bun (it didn't get eaten). The only upside is that the cheese curd appetizer was outstanding... the decor and the cheese curds are the only reason I gave two stars.. this location has seen many different restaurants come and go and I hope this place gets it together soon so they will succeed.",

    "text": "I was super excited for this place to open since I live down the street but I was pretty disappointed. I came on the opening weekend and like other reviewers stated the service was subpar. We also sat down for atleast 15 minutes and watched everyone around us get service. We finally went over to the host to see if we could get some service then five minutes later someone finally showed up. We ordered the nachos and they were terrible. Hardly any cheese and hard as a rock and rubbery when trying to bite them, they were absolutely uneddible. I would have let the waitress know but by the time we flagged her down I was ready to get my check and move on to another bar. The crowd also seemed older, around 50's and the music was bleh. There also isn't much room to dance since the tables are packed in everywhere. It would be nice if they moved out some of the the tables later, say around ten to open up the dance floor more. This place seemed pretty understaffed and overwhelmed. I'll probably give them one more try in another month to see if they got their act together because it would be nice to have a local bar.",

    "text": "I have been to many restaurants in my day, but this was bar far the worst ever!  We waited forever for service and when ordering the waiter seemed put out to find out the \"soup of the day\" for my friend!  I had gone on their website before coming and saw that they have tap wines $1 off.  So I thought thats what I will get.  The waiter comes back and says oh sorry we dont have wine on HH anymore.  I told him I just saw it on the website!  So he checked with his mgr and gave me the $1 off.  I have to say that the food there is excellent and so is the place inside and out, but the staff has a lot to be desired.  We got our check inside so that we could move outside to an available patio fireside table, but waited forever and was charged for the glass of wine I never got.  I told the waiter and he said \"oh, yeah, I forgot!\" and brought it to me.  We all went outside and were hoping for better service, but unfortunately that did not happen. We flagged down a waitress and she sent out a waiter/bartender guy.  The first thing out of his mouth is, OK, so whats the deal with the checks out here?  Is everyone paid inside or what is the deal?  Not Hi, everybody, sorry for the wait, did you settle everything inside or are we starting new checks?  What can I get you?  He finally takes some of tables order but walks away before getting everyones order.  So my husband and I go inside to order the wine and he is waiting forever for his change.  I went back outside to the table while he waited and wondered what was taking so long.  The finally come out from the back room and ask my husband if he has another $20 bill!  He said yes, but what is that?  This $20 is not my bill as he proceeded to show them the bills in his wallet were neat and crisp from the ATM and the bill they were giving him back was washed out and crumpled.  The bartender that was waiting on us outside got in my husbands face and said \"Are you calling me a liar?\"  and my husband said that he was because that was definitely not his $20 and he wanted his $20 back.  The situation was escalating and he did not want to get into a physical altercation with the bartender so he gave them another $20 took the one they gave him and left extremely angry and upset.  I spoke outside to the manager on duty which was very nice, but really needs to get a handle on his employees because they definitely do not know how to treat their customers!  The bartender even came out and yelled at me in front of his mgr and did not even take care of my friends.  I am so sad because I heard such great things about this place.  The food was good but that all.  We will never be back.  Worst experience ever!!!!!",

    "text": "I created a yelp account just to comment on the service we received this evening. The overall concept is amazing - Love the live music and vibe. Probably the worst service I have ever received. Management was standing outside yelling at workers for our whole dinner. Our \"server\" was Adam (I think - name on check) but he only took our order and never came back. We had to ask multiple people for drink refills and the tea he forgot. Drinks from the bar took over 15 minutes. No one came to check on us so we never had the opportunity to ask for the condiments we needed. Had to ask a different server for drink refills. I think the main problem was that we didn't really have a server because multiple had people helped us. Asked two different people for our check and sat forever waiting for it. Noticed that the people next to us never received their drinks either and they were clearly frustrated as well. Looks like they could have really used the staff that was being yelling at for over two hours during their dinner rush. Went inside to get away from the very unprofessional team meeting (yelling match) outside to yet again wait another 20 minutes for a round of drinks. We spent over $200 on food and drinks and really tried to have a good time. Even changed to inside the restaurant to see if things could get better. I REALLY wanted to like this place. The food is very good and the atmosphere is great but if you don't have good staff it kills the whole experience. Looks like management really needs to reevaluate where meeting are held and set a better example. I love supporting local businesses so I will probably be back but I really hope that these issues get worked out.",

We were done with our food and our drinks were empty and we waited once again the service is slow finally the waiter came around and asked us if we wanted another drink and we're like no just give us our check.

The reasons for a 3 star review is the wait staff is SLOW. Both times I waited for a long time after being sat before anyone came over to take my order, my beer went dry between each glass, and getting the bill in a timely fashion was an issue. Second reason is the tables have way too many items on them. It's like playing Tetris when the server brings the food, you have no room for anything.I will definitely try this place again and hopefully update the review with more stars.",

    "text": "Maybe I was at a different bar than the other reviews or the other reviewers work for Charlies but I predict this bar won't last.  Our party of three sat outside.  Nice patio area and has the potential to be a good neighborhood place.  We went there on a Friday night to catch the college game and grab a burger and beer.  Asked several folks who worked there to change the channel on the tv from the news (go figure who goes to a bar to watch the news) to the game.  It took three staff and about 20 minutes for them to figure out how to change the channel on the TV.  There was only one waitress trying to hold down the drink and food orders for the entire patio.  Needless to say the service was horrible.  We had to ask for a food menu and she brought us one menu to share at the table.  We asked for a second menu and by the time she brought it we had already decided by passing around the menu.  Figured we weren't going to get another.  The bartender outside spent more time on the customer side flirting with the customers than he did serving.  Drinks and refills were slow and the orders inaccurate.  Had to ask for napkins, tableware, Ketsup (because the waitress brought us an empty bottle at first), etc. and response was less than prompt.  Most places have specials for happy hour posted on table tops or the wait staff lets you know the specials, not here.  No specials listed so I don't know if they have any.  Nope, not Good Time Charlies more like I don't give a shxx Charlies.  Won't last.  Too bad.",

The pastrami was also very fatty. The waitress noticed what I was doing and she offered to  make another sandwich. I should have accepted her offer. I needed to get back to work so I said no. The sandwitch was barely edible the french fries were prepackaged and freshly fried. I may try it  again. The service was good. I can give their tacos a try.

Entered to a welcoming hostess who informed us it would be about 10 minutes for a table so we walked around and checked the place out. Great decor, atmosphere & busy staff running about. .We spied an empty table against the east wall and wondered why we could not sit there. After 30 minutes, we got that table. So we were a bit frustrated at this point. Almost immediately our waiter, Vince, appeared and gave us our drinks at Happy hour price even though it was now 7:01. We then ordered the Phoenix Phiilly  & Tacos combo. The order came out within 10+ minutes and both entrees did not disappoint!  Phx Philly was not huge but was really filling. The meat was moist, tender and the heat (spice) was spot on! Yum! Loved the fries too! The Barbacoa , pork belly & shrimp tacos were so flavorful & the beans had a nice smoky flavor but were just a touch dry. All in all, great job chefs! We were all around pleasantly surprised with Good Time Charlie's and really wished we had the energy to stick around for the dueling pianos!  We will definitely be back! Thx to all the staff :-)",

The menu options are pretty on point for bar food. The entertainment is great. The one thing that bothers us is the service. It ranges from long wait times from bartenders or servers, orders being wrong and when it comes to asking to split a check be ready to send it back a few times.  How do things get added if they weren't even ordered? We have visited during busy and slow times and it's all the same issue. The thing that calms us down is Charli walking around asking how things are and fixing them. We decided it's a place to go once in a long while instead of making it our frequent meeting spot. :(",

The menu is pretty extensive and they have tons of beers to choose from. I enjoyed the wings, but the rest of the food fell flat for me.  They have a ton of bruschetta boards, but honestly I wasn't impressed. Leave the bruschetta to Postino's.  Overall, the bar food was good and the craft beers are great. Charli's should stick to being a solid bar and leave the fancy menu behind.",

We were there watching the Rose Bowl with a group of about 15.  We had a big variety of food that everyone ordered and ALL of it was Amazing.   From the wings to the pizza to the bruschetta and the chicken kabobs.   There was not one thing that didn't taste great.  The staff was awesome as well.   They were very friendly like we knew them for years and it was our first time being there.   For how busy it was when we were there the speed of the food and drinks come out to us was very good.   I would highly recommend trying this place out.",

In fact had to go back twice to get my coors light at the same time I said we got a food order, so he sent over another server who had NO clue what we needed. She took our orders and that was awesome! I told the bartender that service was terrible and he said they have had a turn over like two years ago, which we had the same service issues back then. So the night was ending, I was waiting for for my wife in the restroom. The bartender started talking to another customer about my conversation with him about bad service, so I heard everything, I waved to him over the bathroom doors, he was stunned/shocked talking bad about a customer. The bartender response was, he had to say service was bad 4 times, guess what saying it 4 times made no difference in the service, still the same. We left thinking nothing changed at GTC!!",

    "text": "My family and I were on the hunt for a new haunt and found Good Time Charli's through yelp. We visited and fell in LOVE. We've been twice in a matter of a couple of weeks and will keep coming back. Both visits were on Sundays around 12-1PM. Our first visit, we were greeted immediately by not one but 3 friendly faces. My daughter was offered to root around and pick a toy from their toy chest (thereby winning her heart) and our ear drums and nostalgia were tickled by the 90s grunge that played the entire time (winning our hearts). The second time it was country on a loop before the live music (also country) started. That was kinda meh and made the second visit a smidge less fun for us. Everyone working was smiling and seemed genuinely happy to be there each time we've been. Both times we got a table right away. The interior is very clean and the decor can be best described as what you would expect your most favorite dive bar would look like after a glow-up. The bar was full of patrons and lots of (presumably) regulars came in while we were there and were greeted by name- which we loved. Think: Cheers! Despite their creative and extensive bar menu, I stuck to a familiar glass of sauvignon blanc but did sample the Arizona Prickly Pear Mule (which was outstanding!). Now to the food.... Being Canadian-born & raised, anytime we see \"poutine\" on the menu somewhere, we HAVE to sample it. It's a matter of principle. The poutine fries were absolutely delicious, though the gravy was different both times- the first time it was a rich and delicious standard brown gravy, the second time it was a SPICY, spicy brown gravy- which was unusual but still delicious. They are extremely generous with the cheese curds which is not the norm (we've found at most restaurants) but VERY appreciated. We devoured the plate between the 4 of us and could have easily torn through another despite the big portion. We also got the rustic pretzel rods- they were served piping hot and were delicious (but pretty basic) but the beer cheese dip- WOW- that stole the show. For entrees, I ordered the \"a la carte\" chipotle chicken tacos- they were really good! The tortillas were toasted, filled to the brim w tender and flavorful chicken and the chipotle aioli was generous and also flavorful. The \"walk the line\" brekkie plate looked delicious (and the sausage was mindblowing, I was told). Portions are really big, so you get a lot of bang for your buck. My son got the Mac Daddy burger and really enjoyed it- it is a behemoth of a burger! My daughter got the kids chicken tenders and again, the portion was huge (adult size) so we had a good amount of leftovers (also always good!) to bring home. We sampled the fried ice cream pie for dessert and it did not disappoint! The second visit, we all opted for brunch. I ordered a pineapple mimosa (or 3) and it was very generous pour!! Not your average mostly-juice-splash-of-sparkling-wine variety. We shared the poutine fries again- this time with the rip-your-face-off-spicy gravy. Delicious, different and satisfying. My entree this time was the spinach-mushroom-onion skillet. It was good/not great but the potatoes and the english muffin were quite tasty and left an impression. The strawberry basil jam was delightful.  One thing to be aware of- and why they get 4 stars and not 5 is that service is a little slow. It's not the kind of place you want to go if you're in a hurry. It's a place to go, slow down and kick back. You will wait for service, you will wait for your food and you will wait for your check. I'm glad we weren't in a hurry when we went the first time otherwise my impression would have been marred by that. But we \"get\" the vibe of the place and appreciate it for forcing us to enjoy the moment and relax and we go only when we have nothing but time on our hands. It's worth the wait.  Everyone we've met there (staff and patrons alike) is friendly, engaging and happy to be there. We love Good Time Charli's and we will keep going back!",

There is absolutely zero hustle in our waitress, and seemed more interested in hanging out than taking care of her customers.  Our waters  were never refilled which was annoying because we were eating very spicy food.  I'm very disappointed, because this used to be my favorite date spot.  On top of all that, our Burger was severely over-cooked. We didn't complain because we were so hungry we just wanted to eat. The fries are awesome, and the wings were good as well.  Pros: Decor, great bands, good drink selections  Cons: very poor service, hit or miss on the food.",

Then my server asked how was everything I said this doesn't taste like chicken and dumplings.  It's over cooked. Looking more like chicken stew with carrots in it too.  Then the owner came over continued to ask me questions about how I make chicken and dumplings. Over 20 minutes just continue to try to justify the food and cook.  My husband couldn't even enjoy his Hamburg.  We were very hungary and only wanted to enjoy our time together.   Charlie did take the  mojito and dumplings off the bill.

    "text": "Tonight was my first visit to this place since it reopened as Goodtime Charli's. I went there to try out their 50 cent wing special on Mondays. The owner has done a great job with the decor! It's the nicest looking place of all of the previous iterations this place has been by far!   I got in there about 5:30 before the big happy hour rush, and that was a good thing since they got very busy shortly after I arrived. I liked the fact that they has a nice patio area where they actually allow you to smoke. I like having a cigarette with my beer.   I got service very quickly, and since I knew what I was having I got my order in fast as well. I tried out their Hot wings, and their dry rub Cajun wings. The wings were large, and they were nice and crispy, but both of them lacked any real flavor. The dry rub was almost nonexistent, and had no taste at all. They just tasted like fried wings with nothing on them. The Hot wings were not much more flavorful. I would call them mild, to medium at best. There was not a whole lot of sauce on them, and it just didn't have any real heat to it at all. Thankfully that had Tabasco out so I could add a little heat, but that's not my favorite thing on wings. I'll be standing them a better recipe here tonight, and hopefully they'll give it a try. They served the wings with the traditional celery, carrots, and ranch dressing. They claim they make their dressings in house, but the ranch dressing was very thin and runny, like they had used 2% milk instead of buttermilk like you are suppose to.   I'll go back again ad try out their burgers next time. I saw one go by, and it looked decent. I can't complain about the service here like many others, but I did notice that others around me were not getting what they asked for very quickly. They do need more help it seemed to me.",

The server who was outside never came and greeted us. We sat there for 15 minutes waiting for her. She KNEW we were there the whole time because we originally asked her where we should sit. I ended up asking another server who brought us menus but he never came back to take our order so we ended up leaving. So disappointed as we were excited to try something new. I don't recommend this place as the servers do NOT care about their customers. When we decided to leave, another group of ladies came and sat RIGHT NEXT to us and the first server went right over and gave them menus. Horrible service.",

The band was great, the country tunes were well known favorites and the ambience was (dare I say) perfect. With the exceptional service by both the bartender and servers, I was pleasantly surprised by how fast our drink orders were delivered even though the bar was packed and the dance floor was full. I always enjoy finding hidden gems like Good Time Charli's where it's obvious there are many regulars who are both friendly and welcoming to new faces.

I will be back ASAP with friends. Just wanted to compliment how great of a bartender and person Ariana is.",

The selection of beers can be a bit overwhelming but it was lunch time so drinking wasn't on the menu for us. Initial greeting could of been better but other staff members were eager to jump in and make sure everything was good for us.   Sat at the bar this time to key an eye on the TV's which was a plus. The menu appears to be in a state of change, but change for the better as lunch this time around was good. I ordered the lunch special Sliders against a few others who had before. My lunch was good and even my coworker was looking and saying 'yeah, looks better than before'!!   Local neighborhood bar with live music in the evenings is an added bonus over other neighborhood bars of looking for something different.",

For their food, the pulled pork, tacos, fries and pretzel bites are all definitely good. They just expanded the menu which helped a lot. I'm not a huge fan of their nachos (the cheese gets to be too much too fast), but I've been impressed with the place. They also have local wines on tap which I appreciate. The atmosphere inside is good too - they did a great job redecorating from the past owners.",

This past Friday we met some friends for the end of Happy Hour and dinner. I'm sad to say the service was terrible!  Our friends arrived before us and had a table and they had received their drinks. We arrived and it was 10 minutes before we could get the waitresses attention so we could order drinks as well. We placed our drink order and my beer arrived quickly but any mixed drinks that were ordered took a long time to arrive. Our food was delicious and came to us hot, but that was the only good thing about our visit. The waitress never came by to see how our food was or if we needed anything else. I certainly can't speak for the whole staff but this particular waitress was not very good.",

But the beer cheese sauce served with them was disgusting. I didn't think cheese could be ruined. This was my second visit.

I was hoping after waiting 30 minutes for hamburgers it would be worth the wait, it wasn't. My burger was undercooked, my food did not come out hot, it had cooled down. (But it was taken off our check when asked how the food was, so thank you for that). Happy hour doesn't include craft beer, only domestic. We learned that when we paid our check.  Would I go back? No. If the waitresses acknowledged us with a smile or a glance, I probably would. But we were COMPLETELY IGNORED. The table beside us, as they were leaving, saw friends coming in. They told their friends the food was not good and eat elsewhere. When we saw our neighbors, we told them the same and they left as well. First impressions are everything and their not off to a good start.  The 5 star reviews have to be family & friends, because this is not a 5 star place.",

I sat at the bar and the service wasn't that great and the dark black hair bartender was rude. She kept talking to the other bartenders talking about the customers calling them idiots. Anyways We got the nachos and the wings. The nachos weren't too bad but not worth $12 not even piled high or real cheese or salsa and the wings absolutely sucked that's probably what did it for me I was craving to have some wings before we even got here and when we got them I had 2 and my wife had 1 and we were done the waitress asked me if I wanted a box and I told her no that's OK she asked if we weren't that hungry and I told her how bad they tasted. The wings tasted like they had a little soap in them very dry and the taste was horrible and then what did it for me and made me decide never to come back here again was the waitress charged me for them. I love wings and have never thrown wings out or wasted them bit these were horrible don't get them. Then when I asked for my tab it took 15mins to get my tab, and I was sitting at the bar. It was almost like she was mad I told her I didn't like the wings. The best part about the night was the band, that's it. I will not be coming back here. The old place here was Beef O Brady's and they had better food.",

I sat at an empty table on the side and waited 10 minutes and nobody approached me. I finally walked up to a server and asked her for a menu and a bud light. A few minutes later, both came to me. The French dip with garlic fries sounded great. Again I waited 15 minutes this time and nobody came back. I found my server and asked her to close me out and paid her for the beer and 1.00 tip. Of course I did not leave her side for fear of being lost again. I left and ate at another place. It appeared 2 servers were trying to cover 20 tables. Need some better floor management .",

The food was great. We had the rustic nachos with green chile pork. It was a very large portion loaded with all the good stuff. Muy delicioso! The chips are worth mentioning as they were fresh, thick and tasty and not overly salted. We both had burgers. I had the Lea & Perrins mushroom Swiss my friend had the Doc Holliday both of which came with fries. The burgers were huge and delicious. We both took half home. It was just as good the next day. We were both so pleased with our experience. It's a bar to be sure but one with unusually good food and that's hard to find. We will definitely be coming back and I will bring others here as well. I see they have live music every night. That's another reason to come back.  Great job Charli and staff!",

The beer is always cold and the wings are some of the best I've ever had. I love to get my wings extra crispy, grilled smothered in hot BBQ. Yum!!! What we love most about GTC is the kid-friendliness, it's family owned and Charli is next level mom goals for owning a bar and also making the bar accessible for their parents with kiddos! Win/win for everyone! Also, not to exaggerate but the green Chile quesadilla is hands down AMAZING. The green chili pork is extremely flavorful with a hint of sweet.

This place is a little neighborhood spot we've been coming to since it used to be the Regal Beagle and then some other place and now Charli's.    I really like the changes that Charli's has made to this place and their food is excellent.    So why the 3-star review?  The last 3-4 times we have visited, there is an overwhelming smell of incense in the restaurant, it may be from a candle.  It's not a bad smell, per say, but just way too strong for a restaurant.  When I'm eating my food, I want to smell the food, not incense.   We have mentioned this to the staff a couple times and they have indicated it's the owner's preference to have the candle lit.   Anyway, we love this place and want it to be successful.  I hope the owner does read reviews and understand the smell in the restaurant is turning business away, we have walked out a couple times after sitting for a few minutes trying to get accustomed to the smell, but not being able to.",

The issue was the quality of the food. I have dined in and ate their bruschetta a few times before without any complaints.  However, the two choices (\"Zach Brown\" and \"Fancy\") I ordered were smothered in fig and caramelized onions to the point where the bread was soggy and there wasn't much goat cheese on either one when both said they came with it.  Very little micro greens, they appeared to be more of a garnishment.  The lemon herb chicken was dry, hard, and seemed like it came from a bag and was reheated.  It was cut in tiny pieces so not much substance. I usually eat food even when it isn't the best I've had but I had to throw it away, it was not appetizing in the least.",

Seeing an owner be so actively involved and loving her customers is so refreshing.   New menu is outstanding, so many appetizers to choose from. The food is really good here and definitely a good value. I love how Charli isn't afraid to offer high-profile food and not just frozen food dropped in a deep fryer. You can definitely taste the freshness of her recipes here.  The live music scene here is unsurpassed. There is such a wide variety of experience and genres and is offered what seems like all the time. It is soooo nice to just know if you want live music, Good Time Charli's is the place to be.  My only personal dislike is the super cool patio has really bad airflow (even though it's outside) and there is always an over abundance of smokers. It's really really smokey! Some addition outside fans (not blasting on high and whizzing in your face) could definitely help here.",

My salad was huge and only $5. meanwhile the \"basket\" of garlic fries for $5.50 was not bigger than a side order.  The taco combo came with 3 tacos and a side of beans for $15, not $14 as it stated on the menu. The bruschetta came with 4 little pieces for $9.  On other positive side, the water was cool and entertaining, and got us our bruschetta on the house as it came 10 minutes after the other items, which were already taking a long time.  The bar is cool with the lights, and the music selection was unique, you never hear Clutch anywhere. I like the place, I may try again, hope they can come out with the food in a more timely manner and either lower prices and enlarge portions :)",

Food took over 45 minutes to arrive after placing our order. Not many people were eating either. Server never checked on us, apologized (not her fault), offered anything or even refilled our waters. It seemed like she was the only one working besides the bartender. FIX your service issues, have a roaming to make sure people's beverages are topped off, you might even sell a few more rounds, hire some more attentive servers. We have been going to Teakwoods for 20 years. They still pretty much nail it every time with service and food. The one time that they goofed bad the manager proactively came over to our table and comped our meal. The remodel from the old bar to Good Time Charlie's is nice but it was too dark inside. Hope you can fix these things because you can tell the locals want it to be a success.",

Beers were ice cold and had a good selection.  If there was a knock on this place it would be the service.  Wait staff was knowledgeable and attentive but I don't think there were enough.

The food we had for the party was amazing..... (especially the Cajun dry rub wings) but she really went all out on the fruit platter!. It was simply beautiful!

    "text": "So the main reason I wanted to try this good time Charli's was because there's one in Michigan (Ann arbor to be exact... not sure if they're part of the same chain but still I was curious lol) so we decided to try this little spot out to celebrate my roommate getting into grad school!   We went in on a Tuesday evening, but I would say it was pretty packed haha. I think it's because they have reverse happy hour, as well as different deals almost everyday of the week. We ended up just getting some reverse happy hour drinks (I believe well cocktails were 4.50? Sangria $5 small beer on tap 4 and large beer on tap $5? Something like that haha they were pretty inexpensive that's all I remember) as well as a huge drink called the trash can (fitting for me ). It was pretty good! I didn't drink much so I can't comment on the drinks, but we did order the chicken strips with garlic basil fries and OMG the fries were soooo good, and the chicken strips were surprisingly really juicy. Super yummy for bar food.   The crowd was a bit different from what we're used to, we were prolly the youngest people in there but that's fine! The people were so nice and we made a few friends who happen to be regulars so it was a all in all good time. There's also an electronic juke box which I was hyped about haha   The lost one star because of the service. Our server let us know that he was the only one working all areas of the floor so he must have been swamped, but we decided to move outside because the music was just way too loud where we were sitting. He never came to check up on us, and when we went to get one last drink at the bar & close our our tab, it took (no lie) like 15 mins lol I was waiting to pay all awkward but it's alright. I would come back again!",

Place was packed when we first go there at 6:30 on a Saturday but hostess got us a great table with 10min. Party of 6 became party of 10 by 8pm an our waiter was amazing! He kept the drinks flowing, food coming, and even laughed with us. And when we left at 11:30 he had all the checks in order.   So about the vibe... one of the best places we've been to for live music, band was excellent, decor was cool with all the bottle lights, layout is easy to move around and not be all bunched up like other places, and will definitely be back. And we go out a lot to listen to live music.  I'd highly recommend you visit!  A great local bar with fun atmosphere and good music n food.",

It was fixed and tasted great. My daughter ordered Mac and cheese it was over powering with green onions and had a bland taste. We sent it back and asked for rice and beans. The waiter than brought our bill with the Mac and cheese still on it. After my husband asked about it. The waiter said what's the problem to which my husband explained. The waiter than said really because of a couple of onions my husband then replied no because it was over powering onions and did not taste good. He said fine. Just now he came back and literally almost threw the check on the table and stormed off. Really poor service tonight. As an update the owner got back to us and apologized. We will go back for sure.",

It was our first time here, we tried to come a couple weeks ago on a Friday and the wait was 90 minutes.  This Sunday evening wasn't so  busy but they weren't slow either.  The waitress stayed on top of our order, my wife ordered Chicken Kabobs that she loved and I ordered a California Avocado Burger, it was really good.  Side note, the fries that came with my burger were big enough to be it's own meal.    The vibe was great, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and the employees seemed to be having a good time as well.    Places like this are rare, I will definitely be back.

One thing that did surprise me is that they serve breakfast from 10-2 each day. Not many bars do that. The staff as was during my last visit happy to serve and we had not issues with our server, Jen. She was very attentive and took great care of us during our stay. We arrived at 11:30 AM and it was Happy Hour. The Bloody Mary's were only $3 and they were more than worth the price. They add bacon, olives, asparagus, beans and spiced yellow peppers. One of the best I've had in the Phoenix area.  I will be going back to have one of those.   Have been back numerous times and this place still is a 4 star. Good food daily entertainment and fun staff.",

Got a flight of local beers that was really good too.

Great selection of beers, still have your Budlight, Coors and so on, but craft beers from local brewries as well throught the US.  Tried three of the burgers, they were great. Servers were new and in training but handled themselves very well, lots of people checking on us when it was crowded. They take service seriously and were working the kinks of a new business out.  I cannot complain because they gave it all they had and made it work well.  Very happy so much we went back, played 36 holes of golden tee for $10, had a great time. Can't wait to see a band there.  This place will erase your nightmares of local drunk that use to inhabit the Regal Beagle.   Love it.",

Bar staff is great, wait staff is good for the most part, but the kitchen needs some major improvements. First visit our order never got put in and an hour later we ordered without the appetizer, second time kitchen was massively under staffed and we literally got no food, this past time we ordered the pretzel knots and didn't get them for 40min. We were told the first ones got burnt then I pointed out the second ones were not even close to being done on the inside and said we were done only to be told the rest of our order that we placed only a few minutes before was done (trying to say to bad you have to take your order). We talked to the manager and she was apologetic and understood unlike the waitress. Sadly we won't be returning for a 4th time.",

If you have to sit anywhere else in the bar, you might as well be sitting in your car on the parking lot, since they never get your order or ask if you need another beer. You have to walk back to the bar to ask for something. We walk into the place and walk back out if there's no seats at the bar. It shocks me that management doesn't recognize this as a problem.",

    "text": "I'm sad to downgrade my rating here. After our first visit we were so enameled that we returned several times-often bringing one or several new people to try what we had thought was in the running for our new favorite place. The first time I was understanding of the slower service due to having invited over 10 people to meet us there. However, each time we have returned, we continue to be underwhelmed by the service-and yet, we keep going back HOPING that all those last half dozen visits were anomalies. Here is the great things about the place:  as most people mention, the decor is just really cool; the menu is extensive and interesting-haven't had anything that wasn't very decent-the other night, a BYOB burger with lettuce wrap and a fried egg and basil garlic fries-OMG; great beer selection and awesome daily drink specials; THE ENTERTAINMENT!!!  Now then, Charli I really hope you take this in the spirit I'm giving it, because again, we WANT to love it. But we haven't been in there once since our first visit where we were even acknowledged by a server before having sat for 10 or more minutes. It makes customers feel small and unimportant when they sit there awkwardly even waiting for a greeting let alone a drink order. I will say that a few times, our service has been perfectly fine AFTER that first long wait. We typically come between 4-6 pm and it's not always terribly busy. Unfortunately, a few times, our service has continued to remain slow for the entire visit. Two days ago, we had the first experience-it took awhile to be noticed (and several other parties who came in after were greeted before us) but afterward things were good-until half our table of 4 was done eating, and then we had a hard time locating our server again for drink refills. Honestly, in the 15 minutes we waited to be helped initially, we considered leaving but in retrospect are glad we stuck around. I hope this place can get their service act perfected because it really has so very much potential. And to be truthful, I will deal with less than stellar food, but, call it my deep-seated and long-lived personal insecurities, being ignored when I'm ASKING to pay for service feels really wrong. Thanks for listening :)",

Our waiter was so terrible. we had to ask for everything like 3 or 4 times, and had to wait incredibly long amounts of time to get anything that we ask for.. at one point I was sitting there for 20 minutes without any water!! So I went inside and flagged my waiter down, as we were sitting on the patio. I told him that i've been sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for more water. guess what he tells me. he says well, there is a jug of water outside, just go get it.  And I looked at him, and I said, really, dude?? I was so mad, and he had an even worse attitude towards the end of the night. every time that we had to ask him for more things, he started getting really irritated with us. It's sad, because the food was really good, but I'm not going to come back to get service like this ever again.",

Didn't know what to expect being our first time, but after watching multiple musicians kept switching things up it was a night we will never forget.

The service was consistently sub par (and that's being really nice). I'm a very generous tipper when service anything above average. We stopped coming here because the service just wouldn't come up to an a average level. Well we came back to check it out after a several month hiatus  The only thing that changed is the food just barely makes the average bar food grade. I'm pretty sure they've had a chef change as the pizza that used to have a unique crust is competing with frozen pizza. Anther interesting thing to note is the offer for $5 coupon for online reviews if you show the review to your server. I wonder how many 4-5 star reviews for this place were bought for $5? Service sucks (took almost 5 minutes to even acknowledge us) and our pitcher of beer has been empty for 15 minutes. Won't be back!",

When she brought our drinks, she asked if we wanted menus. We ordered, but the beer and appetizers were served at the same time as the meal. We still didn't have napkins or silverware, and the runner said we'd have to ask someone else for that because he didn't know where it was. The order was wrong and never corrected. Still waiting to see our server and get the check so we can head out and never come back. There's someone arguing with another server that he wants his ID returned, so at least that's entertaining.  There's so much focus on the daily events that service feels like an afterthought. Big mistake.  Update: Got the bill and we were overcharged. Surprise.",

She came up to us several times while we were still eating and drinking asking if we wanted boxes.  When we were ready to pay she was less available.   Now for the food. We ordered wings (honey hot and honey BBQ) and the Doc Holiday burger.   The good: the wings were large and cooked well.  The seasoning on the fries was great  The bad: the burger, despite being undercooked, was not juicy and was basically tasteless. The honey BBQ wings had no flavor, I mean none. Perhaps a hint of sweetness but no BBQ flavor.  Lastly where we were seated we could hear the music from the kitchen loudly playing.   This place could be great, it just needs to work on a couple things.",

We walked in to a smelly aroma of perfume air freshener.   I ordered a French dip sandwich that was below average. My husband ordered a hamburger that was below average. The clientele around was getting in verbal fights around us. This seems to be a rough joint!!  I wish this place the best but we won't be back and I hate to say it... don't waste your time or energy on this one....",

As I said, great friendly people but you need to prep mentally and set aside an allowance of patience for the lackadaisical service, even at the bar sitting in front of the staff they will get to you when they get to you, if it is marginally busy come another day or check your expectations at the door. This otherwise would be a 5 star review hopefully they will decide to get their game face on.",

Burgers, salad w/fillet mignon, grilled fish tacos - we each loved our meals and our drinks - especially the selection of beers (and Bonus, they have Heineken!). Our service was fantastic and the waitress was very attentive. We sat in the front near the stage. When the band started, the acoustics were perfect! Not too loud... The band \"Tick, Tick, Boom\"  was very, very good playing 80s, 90s and current music.    The place was very busy from the time we got there until we left. This place is a Gem. Five stars!",

We had a tab that we fully paid for that I'm quite sure had overcharged on it and when I told the server that I was told it couldn't be verified because my server had left for the day. Fine I paid it and tipped the bartender. A few minutes later a different bartender told me I never paid a tab and sure enough I had a different tab, fine I paid that one to then this server a different bartender rudely scolded me for not tipping embarrassing me in front of my guests. Wow you spend over 200 in a dive bar and this is how your treated. I will never go back and I warning all who read this to not go there. You will be overcharged and you will be treated badly.",

Order came out with just one order of fries that didn't have the garlic it was supposed to, be brought us a second one. Got another ranch and the wings were grilled. The bill is where we were a little shocked...$6 for fries and then $2 more for garlic? I must have interpreted it wrong but the back said a side of fries $2. Then I got charged .50 for ranch and .50 for grilled wings...wish I would have been told this prior to ordering. The food was very basic, ranch almost tasted like mayo. We won't be back, maybe this is just a place for drinks on a Saturday night.",

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the overwhelming spicy floral(?) type smell. It unfortunately takes away from the atmosphere and the smell and taste of the food.
