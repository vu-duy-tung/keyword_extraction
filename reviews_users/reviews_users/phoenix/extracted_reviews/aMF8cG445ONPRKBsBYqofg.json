The mushrooms were super juicy, the hollandaise was creamy and the perfect amount of sweet! My second egg was over done but they brought me out a new plate fast, without question and left the overdone benedict for the table to munch on - the mushrooms were too good to let go to waste). The bloody Mary was also delicious. Spicy and not too filling - a perfect pair for any brunch. I am an avid bloody mary seek and drinker - I'd give this a 3.75 out of 5 - worth a try if you like spicy!",

Only waited about 10 minutes for a table on Saturday morning around 10am, and the wait staff was friendly and attentive on a busy Saturday. Food was super reasonably priced and tasty. Not the best brunch of my life, but definitely great food for a good price! They had some awesome looking breakfast cocktails, but we did not partake  Definitely recommend the Breakfast Grilled Cheese Sandwich!! But I had to split it with my fiance cause it was so heavy!!   Note about the place - it is a little hard to find. The entrance is up the stairs on a side street, not on Jefferson, so we walked around the block a couple times before figuring it out!  Would absolutely recommend to anyone in the area!",

Much as anywhere in the area, there is no private parking lot for the restaurant, but since it was a Sunday, there wasn't much of a problem finding street parking. Once seated, we ordered a small fresh squeezed orange juice, a coffee, the Quick Start, the Golden Malted Waffle, the Regular Sweet Cream Pancakes (full order), & the BC Signature French Toast. Overall, the everything was good, nothing that you'd remember to recommend to friends, however. The orange juice was way too sour but the highlights of breakfast were the waffle, french toast, & the bacon from the quick start. The waffle was really light and fluffy, the french toast was also well made (didn't smell egg-y like it does at some other places) and had plenty of berries & nuts, and the bacon was thick cut & tasty. Service was unfortunately a disappointment; it was relatively busy inside and outside the restaurant & when we got there, they had to clear off a table for us, but at no point after we got our food did the waitress come by to ask if everything was good & we had to ask someone else who came to get our plates for the bill. If I happen to be in the area, I might stop by again but I wouldn't make a trip to go eat there.",

Once ordered it was pretty typical and clockwork, check was dropped half way thru, followed by another 5 min later (lending me and my bar mates to discuss who's check was what...). This was followed by another 10 minutes before anyone came back to retrieve the checks (and some pissed off looks when the \"waiters\" had to clear plates, not the \"buss boys\").  Might give it a second chance next time I am in town, maybe it's better and more efficient on weekdays.

While there was a wait for outdoor seating, we were seated right away inside.   Our server was friendly and attentive. The menu has a great selection of brunch and lunch items. I opted for the breakfast burrito with chorizo queso. It was massive and jam packed with chorizo, scrambled egg, black beans and lettuce. It was served with o'brien potatoes and a skewer of fresh fruit. I made it about 2/3 through and handed the rest over to my husband to finish.  He ordered the border bowl which was also a large portion and loaded with meat. Everything was very reasonably priced for the portion size.   Coffee was good and they have your standard coffee bar selections, and again, reasonably priced. They had a nice selection of brunch cocktails including a Bloody Mary with housemade V-18 juice - will have to try next time.  The place was packed, but service was quick!",

Unless your a big eater I suggest splitting it.  It's layers of delicious flavors!  I chose the hash browns instead of the standard O'Brien potatoes.  Layers from bottom up:  hash browns, Frittata with a good layer of 2 cheeses, tinga pulled chicken, avocado (smashed), tortilla strips and served with a side of sour cream and house hot sauce.   The hot sauce isn't that hot but it's got a good flavor.   Hubby got the breakfast grilled sandwich.  He said it was okay.   Needed something??  Overall they have to many options not to come back again. : )",

The chili chicken omelette isn't super spicy so it's perfect (I'm sure you can ask it to be made extra spicy). My favorite way of eating the two Entrees are together (lol). I would definitely go back a third time. The only reason I'm giving this place four starts is because of two things: today, when I was there it kind of smelled funny outside- almost like trash but only for a minute here and there. Second reason is because this woman was sitting in front of us and was being harassed by some man that came and sat right next to her and didn't even order food- no one came and told that guy to leave her alone. She came to enjoy her meal alone and couldn't even do that in peace.",

We found out a few minutes later that the last person in our party was gonna be bringing her 2 kids with her so one of my girlfriends went to ask the hostess if we could be moved to a larger table that seated 7 & she was rude to her in her tone of voice, & then she asked \"if all 7 were here right now\" she said no they are on their way & my girlfriend proceeded to tell her that we were not seated at a table the proper size to begin with. She said \"once they arrived they could move us.\" Then the waitress that was assigned to us saw the fourth person in our party arrive & asked her if she wanted a menu when the other three of us had already ordered, WELL OF COURSE SHE DOES!   Did she think she wants to sit & watch us eat? The fourth girl had to request a water & utensils to eat, because they weren't brought for her. The meal I chose came with 3 eggs in addition to the biscuit & gravy & I  am not an egg eater so I asked the waitress if I could sub out bacon, (which was only two slices) for the egg, she said sure we can do that. At the end of it all after just horrible untimely or attentive service my bill comes & there is a charge for bacon for $3.50 so I ask her when she comes to collect payment \"why am I being charged $3.50 for bacon\" and she says \"oh I asked the kitchen & they said they couldn't do that, so I charged you,\" so of course we are all beyond pissed at the entire experience at this point so I said \"don't you think you could've come & told me that instead of putting in my order & assuming I would just pay for it? \" After all it was just two slices of bacon replacing three eggs. So I told her at that point that I was not paying for it and she needed to either take that off my ticket or go get the manager so she said OK no problem she left took it off my bill and brought it back and everyone at my table only tipped her 10% because she's honestly lucky she got anything!! Two of us wrote messages on the restaurant copy receipt about our service and how horrible it was. THIS PLACE SUCKS!! They don't care about service at all!!!!",

The hostess said they ran out of stickers and I need to walk over to the gym and ask them to violate my parking. I asked to speak to the manager. He said this is something they do all the time. He offered to go with me. I was not happy. I did go to the gym and the nice young lady at the desk said ask if I was a member. She was nice to help me.

    "text": "I ate here twice during Comicon, and both experiences were very positive. They were insanely busy and so service was understandably a bit delayed. The 4 stars is due to high drink pricing and attention to detail (dirty tabletop, no steak knife provided with a steak dish).   I tried the filet mignon benedict, and it was worth every penny. Great flavor, perfectly medium rare. The hollandaise came out less saucy and more like mayonnaise- that is a preference issue I suppose. There is a varried menu, I also tried the bacon breakfast sandwich which was top notch. Definitely check this place out.",

It was off to a slow start getting a table with miscommunication on our reservation but they found the room to seat our group outdoors, and it was a great morning for it. I ordered the Turkey Bene plate,came with potatoes & fruit and was not disappointed, tasted great, best eggs benedict I've had yet! Some others ordered amazing looking pancakes, one plate looked big enough for 3 people, great deal for your buck! Great place to go if your in downtown Phoenix. p.s. I was so not happy about them not having Diet Coke, but the coffee was good and held me over until I could satisfy that addiction elsewhere.",

Come here if you like decadent pancake options such as bananas foster toppings.  However, if you are looking for traditional breakfast plates stick to the diners that you are used to (I came here because I couldn't find a Cracker Barrel near by) as their standard breakfast items are good, but are not vastly different or tastier than your normal diner (ex buck wheat pancakes here vs grain pancakes at IHOP).  Best for people wanting to try something new.",

This time there was a little issue with getting the attention of a staffer to be seated, but the food did not disappoint. Challah has to be one of my favorite breads, so seeing that their french toast was made with it just about had me dancing in my seat. I ordered two slices because I assumed they were going to be along the same lines as the huge, thick, and fluffy chocolate chip pancakes I had during Easter - I was right.  The slices were the size of my face so they more than filled my hungry stomach and the side of pork sausage and bacon was the cherry on top. I would definitely recommend Breakfast Club Cityscape to anyone who's looking for a good breakfast place downtown. They're open on the weekends, too! Next time I look forward to trying some of their lunch options - I think the grilled cheese is calling my name.",

It was so off that it warrants this review. In no way shape or form was what I experienced today acceptable in any establishment. I'm sharing this in the hopes that the management reviews since I didn't see a single manager present today.   Two of the three meals we ordered came out correct. The third one was incorrect and was immediately taken back to the kitchen. I was under the understanding it was being corrected. 15 minutes later, our server came to check on us. It was at that point we made her aware of what happened with the 3rd meal. It was apparent whomever delivered our food did not make her aware of what had happened.   About 5 minutes later, yes we are now 20 minutes into this debacle, she returns with the SAME plate of food that was originally brought out. She indicated that we could go ahead and keep that and they would remove the charge from the bill. Excuse me? I now have food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for (at least) 20 minutes. It was far from warm let alone fresh. I don't think I needs go into detail of what happens to eggs, fruit and toast that has sat this long under a lamp.   Needless to say, not a great visit. The visit overall would have been more than 1 star had it just involved the first part of the experience. But, at the point the waitress did what she did, the entire experience became that of epic proportions. Overall, extremely disappointing from a usually solid local restaurant experience.",

Within 10 minutes we were seated with drinks and menus! The server was friendly and knowledgeable. They have a wide array of breakfast foods and cocktails for everyone's likes. I ordered the breakfast burrito and told the server I was a vegetarian so no meat at all. He immediately told me they cook the black beans in pork- which for a vegetarian is a no! I was so grateful how thoughtful he was with the small details of the menu. That in itself would make me come back!   To round it off they have a great outdoor area for seating. The server did mess up our tabs and charged mine with 2 of the other couples but he caught it before bringing it to us and had the manager come over to tell us what happened and to apologize (nice service touch!)  This is truly a must try downtown, whether sitting inside or out!",

When I sat down and waited for a server to bring me a menu I was getting caught up with what happened before I arrived. The asked what I wanted to drink and then asked me if I wanted her to get me a menu to look at??? It was obvious that I just joined my group of friends. Was she thinking that I made the drive to come and stare at my friends eat??? As we are sitting there chatting the busser comes and asks my friend if she wanted him to take away her plate ( that she just got ) . Which she barely eaten a  quarter of her plate . Although the sweet girl who came out to bring my friends food wasn't our server she was nice enough to ask if she (didn't ask for her name, but I should've  because I liked her out of all) can put in my order. Shen then asked me how I wanted my huevos (eggs) and I asked for them over easy. When my food arrived I had to ask for my Utensils and napkin. My huevos were over cooked. So overall I would never come back here nor do I intend on recommend this place to anyone I know .",

The pancakes were average size, thin, and they used a portion of a banana, not even a whole one. For a $50 dollar breakfast for 2, I would expect much more. It was not worth it.",

That was so good with the horseradish sauce. The eggs were so fluffy and overflowing. Hubby had the eggs bacon potatoes very good.   But wait...then on Sunday we went back again and met up with my sister, my son and his wife to say goodbye as we were heading home to Nevada. My sister and I shared the breakfast burrito.

I got the blue corn blueberry pancakes and was really satisfied. They were a tiny bit dry but the syrup and house made \"berry butter\" fixed it up to perfection. Wait staff was very pleasant from beginning to end. They serve lunch and breakfast the whole time they're which was great for my travel party since we flew in from 3 hours ahead and wanted lunch at 9:30 A.M.",

It was ok. I ordered the Cali Bene. It was tomatoes, avocado, turkey and poached eggs. I asked for no tomatoes. It came with tomatoes. No big deal, I pulled them off. It's the turkey that was strange. Looked like tofu. It was spongy and square... weird. My friend had an omelet with turkey in it and the turkey was just sliced lunch meat.  I'd say order something without turkey. The fruit was good as well as the friend potatoes.",

Everything about this plate was spectacular. Canadian bacon, No fat. Not chewy. Grilled peppers and onions were super tasty. The server (Jenn from New Orleans) was the icing on the cake. Friendly, diligent, persistent and recommended what I believe was the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. I cannot wait to come back. This place is for everyone too! Indoor and outdoor seating. Keep up the amazing work.",

For me.. breakfast and weekends at home go together like pancakes and syrup and champagne and Oj! I was so happy to see another location of Breakfast Club come to the valley! This location is downtown; has a great patio and you can walk up to the bar and get started with morning libations or the hair of the dog drinks while you wait for your table. I highly recommend the Bloody Mary! The menu has a variety of unique breakfast items like Omelets, Benes and several southwest dishes too, just to pay homage to our great area. All made with fresh ingredients! There are the usual waffle and pancake items too... on this particular weekend day, we sat outside under one of the large umbrellas and I had a Breakfast Grilled Cheese and a Cappuccino... just to top off that amazing Bloody Mary I had ! The BCC is a sourdough sandwich layered with hash browns; eggs; bacon; two( !!!! ) cheeses--- Fontina and cheddar and toasted perfectly! My husband and I had such a great time on this patio and the service was so friendly ..we had another drink .. this time a Mimosa and spent another hour up here.. I highly recommend this place for breakfast, brunch or any Fun Day!",

    "text": "It was the 3rd meet up for The Breakfast Club UYE this year, and had a good turn out! The placed picked this time was Breakfast Club downtown Phoenix at CityScape, now prior to the meet up I did call the Breakfast Club to let them know that we had a party of 10 to 15 coming in the morning on Sat, and the manager said no problem, we can put some tables together but it will work, so I said great, thank you and see ya on Sat!  Sat morning came and I checked in at the hostess told her that we are here and she said oh, I didn't know anything about you guys coming, if you don't mind waiting I have a table I can sit you at when the existing party leaves, said no problem and we waited.    We sat at a table that was sort of inside and outside, and it was a beautiful Sat morning for Phoenix, when we were waiting for the table, we passed around a menu so I already knew what I wanted. Everyone placed their orders and conversation was flowing and it was just a really good vibe.  The hostess and our server were very friendly and nice, love places that have great service, it makes you want to come back more.  Oh then the food started coming out, let me tell you, everything everyone ordered looked amazing! There were big blueberry pancakes, breakfast grilled cheese sandwich, turkey bene, huevos rancheros, breakfast burritos and more! I was pretty set on what I had ordered and when those plates starting coming out, I was drooling, it was cool seeing the menu in full color, every plate was beautifully prepared and vibrant in color.  My son ordered the breakfast burrito and a bowl of yogurt with berries, he said the yogurt was amazing, and he loved his breakfast burrito, he was stuffed and couldn't stop eating it, but he did and took half of it home and ate it for breakfast the next day.   I ordered chocolate chip pancakes, you can take me to a grown up place but I will still get me the chocolate chip pancakes haha. Also ordered a side of the potatoes Obrien, the pancakes were perfectly sweet and tasty! The syrup was in a glass bottle, like for olive oil, I thought man that's pretty sweet idea. On the potatoes Obrien I was just expecting potatoes with peppers, but what I got was so much better, huge home-style potatoes and nice slices of fresh peppers & onions!  My breakfast was delish baby!  It was a great breakfast club uye, look forward to the next one!",

I had the Lean and Green Omelet with a side of bacon.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/breakfast-club-phoenix?select=uvj8DJyrCItJkV4E9AFqHg#m0Vvp-J0oR0j1UxusMrO3A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/brea...</a>  The egg-white omelet was very delicious with spinach, broccoli, bell pepper and onions on the inside.  I requested to hold the cheese on mine and I substitute that cholesterol with bacon!    The standout in this event, besides meeting new Yelpers, was the service.  For a party so large <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/breakfast-club-phoenix?select=uvj8DJyrCItJkV4E9AFqHg#c5bPyX-c--ABMMX-LNM0Mw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/brea...</a> , the service was pretty darned good if I do say so myself.  HA!  I just found out by reading someone else's review in the side bar that our reservation was lost.  I had no idea.  Maybe that explains why the server was so nice?  I'm not sure.  All in all, I was very happy with the service.  The great part about this resto is that it is located mere steps outside of the (I hate mentioning another business in a review) Palomar Hotel in the Phoenix City Scape.  You exit the backside of the hotel and you're right there at the restaurant.    The parking garage <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/standard-parking-phoenix-2#hrid:f7Y3tSYRFG3K-BJclN_5qg\">yelp.com/biz/standard-pa...</a>  below Cityscape is a convenient place to park.  You take the elevator up and exit near the restaurant's entrance.  Be sure to get your parking ticket validated by BC.  I would definitely go back here!",

As for the service my only complaint was the speed of service for waiting for the check.  I'll admit our waitress only came up to us twice while we were eating to check on us,  but that's what I prefer.  I hate when a server comes up every five minutes and interrupts conversation,  so this was an awesome change from a corporate ihop kind of service.   Anyways, as for the food there was pluses and minuses to both our dishes so I'd say a B+ over all.  I had the original Ben which was super filling and can say is worth the $10. The sauce is nothing fancy,  but the ham is really what makes it.  My boyfriend ordered the quick start with four eggs.  Also super filing and worth the money.  Again the meat was the best part,  but the jelly was actually the star of the show. I just wish the potatoes had some more seasoning and the fruit was a little fresher.   Ps order the orange juice, is definitely freshly squeezed and so refreshing!  Also had my first espresso here so can't say much other than it was so black and strong.",

When we arrived, the ladies at the front said there was a short 15-minute wait, so we left our name and phone number and walked over to CVS to get sunscreen. I dont know how they timed it that perfectly, but at 14 minutes, my husband got a text saying our table was ready. We were promptly seated in a nice semi-circular booth--my favorite kind of seat. I have no idea who our waitresses were--we had a couple of people helping us--but they were all very fast and pleasant. I had the eggs Benedict and my husband had the pancakes with the fruit and nut topping. Everything was absolutely perfect. The woman who was responsible for cleaning/bussing tables was amazing. If I had a restaurant, I'd hire her to train people. She was so efficient and did a great job. Seriously--True of everyone who was helping us that day, but this gal cleaned off tables for parties of at least 8 people in the blink of an eye. Probably not important for a yelp review, but it just added to my experience. How'd we get seated so quickly with a long line on a Saturday mid-morning? The staff and management obviously know how to run this place really well. I appreciate that. We will return the next time we are in town.",

These all taste great and range from $9 - $11. The size of the omelet is so big, it's a no brainer to share. Or in my case, make two to three breakfasts out of it. With a side of pork candy(bacon), my meal is replete.  The BC Signature French Toast is lightly griddled and crisp-delicious. I love the challah bread base and the fresh fruit on top. Again, full order is a lot of food. You can order the French toast regular and their sweet cream pancakes per slice/per cake. Let me tell you- Their French toast reheated in the workplace toaster oven is awesome. Double points for using real maple syrup!  I look forward to trying their Benedicts and Southwest bowls.  If you order for take out, they'll give you a range of when you can expect to pick up the order. Usually ready in 10 mins.  The reason for four stars is there is no 4.5 stars. Sometimes in the coffee kiosk, where you pick up your order, it will sit while they ring up the customers grabbing a coffee. I hate my food getting cold. And you can tell those of us who are standing there waiting to be acknowledged to get take out orders.  So if that gets better organized, I will bump up my rating.",

    "text": "I absolutely love the food here I've gotten the BC Bagel and the Whole Hog Omelet and they were both so delicious. I usually like sitting at the bar but these last 2 times have been a bad experience. When I took a drink of my mimosa there seemed to be some black gunk floating in the drink. I ask my friend if she also had it and she did! We pull it out and it's squishy and we smear it between our fingers. I would have to assume it was from the orange juice container and it seemed like mold and no apology from the server mind you. There is also always gnats or some type of small black bug always around the bar area. Now a whole new visit, I was given the wrong coffee and when I let the waitress know this she seemed more annoyed than anything and again I received no apology. Then when I received my new coffee the cup and it wasn't even full! It's unfortunate that I feel that a 2 star rating is what this place deserves based on the service I receive as well as the cleanliness.",

We parked in a nearby parking garage attached to part of City Scape. After walking around a little bit, we made our way across the street to the other side of City Scape and went up an escalator. Immediately we saw a center courtyard area with tables/umbrellas. The Breakfast Club has a small building where they make specialty coffee drinks. They have a sit down restaurant across from the the coffee building. We walked into the restaurant and were immediately greeted by a nice young waiter who seated us in a booth. We were handed menus and we noticed they serve both breakfast and lunch. We chose breakfast with coffee. We both decided to order the breakfast sandwich with hash browns, eggs, and two types of cheese on sourdough bread. Our waiter suggested we order it with the egg somewhat runny, stating: it's messy but good. We took his suggestion and it was an excellent one!  The breakfast sandwiches were delicious, fresh and hot. The Applewood bacon and hash browns were crisp. The yolk runny and delightful. It was by far one of the best breakfast sandwiches we've ever eaten.  Our waiter was friendly and nice.  We will return! As we were leaving, Blue Bunny employees was handing out coupons and free ice cream. We tried some and it was a perfect ending on a Friday afternoon.",

    "text": "On my my recent trip to downtown Phoenix for business, I stayed at the Kimpton Palomar. Breakfast Club- CityScape was recommended by a few of the hotel staff members so my co-workers and I made this our \"go-to\" place for breakfast being that they are located right outside of the hotel.   After doing plenty research after the recommendations I was pretty sold on the fact that they are going to deliver on the food! I was most excited with the many positive reviews and anticipated that our experience as a group would be the same. Unfortunately that didn't happen at all. The breakfast club dropped the ball heavily on not one but two of our visits for breakfast.   On our first breakfast experience we checked in with the hostess and started out with a not so friendly greeting but that was overlooked. For starters things just started off really tough.  We had issues that day and the previous with the food as well as the espressos coming out cold. Lipstick prints from previous customers on the coffee cups. When bringing these issues up to our server it was automatically an issue instead of creating a solution. This place has just so much unnecessary attitude from a lot of the girls that work here it's not even funny.  Alyssa who was our server the first day right from the beginning was pretty nasty. She wasn't friendly at all and had a very unwelcoming demeanor. My co-worker got a receipt snatched out of her hand from Alyssa, some eye rolling, blowing out hot air you name it. She was AWFUL!   On the second day we again arrived at the hostess station to check in thinking that we would like to give them the benefit of doubt about what happened the previous day.  We requested that we didn't receive the server Alyssa again and the hostess thought it was funny. Assuming that was communicated to the new server she also came over with an unnecessary attitude.   After being fed up with this type of behavior finally one of my coworkers requested the manager who came over pretty much in awe of what we had experienced. It was our lucky day because the operations/district manager was available he too couldn't believe what kind of service we had been receiving.   I'm sure by now you're wondering well damn what about the food? The food was decent and to be quiet honest when you have service as terrible as what we experienced the food didn't even matter at that point. I did hear one of my co workers compliment the French toast sticks so that we can say it's safe to order. My salmon egg Benedict was pretty decent as well. Skip the apple juice as it's some sort of organic flavor that they fail to explain prior to ordering with the assumption that everybody will just like the taste. Being that I don't visit Phoenix often I can't say that I'd even care to visit them again..",

I couldn't eat the potatoes, they are not gluten free, I had bacon as my side. The omelette was ok. I love pesto but the pesto on the omelette was not my favorite. The bacon was great. It was better than the omelette. It was thick cut. The service was fantastic.   Overall I would recommend eating here. I will go back and will try a different omelette.",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were too high because of the great reviews on Yelp! Facebook and from the front desk of my hotel but - while the food was definitely tasty - I don't think it was great.  The service was just kinda meh, and good flavors of the food were diminished by the fact that nothing was hot.   So the menu is creative, with some of your expected breakfast favorites and a nice selection of in-house specialties. I had the biscuits and gravy - which uses a jalapeno cheddar biscuit (yum) with sausage gravy, two eggs on top (the only thing in my whole meal that required salt & pepper ) which were cooked perfectly over medium, and potatoes O'Brien, plus a sausage patty that I added for good measure.   I appreciate that they're making everything fresh - this was not a frozen biscuit, the potatoes were fresh baby reds with red & green bell peppers and onions. The sausage patty was even handmade (can't swear to it being house-made sausage, but it was definitely formed by hand not the usual perfect circle).  The food all had a really flavor - but the problem was that it was all lukewarm.  The sausage gravy was congealing on the plate - no steam even as I cut through it and into the biscuit. The sausage patty was over cooked and dry - but had a nice flavor profile. I'll bet if it was a little less cooked and served straight off the grill it would be ah-mazing.   This is a personal pet peeve - but if I order and iced tea I expect iced tea. If you brew fruit infused tea, tell me. Don't let me taste it unknowingly and have that nasty taste in my mouth.  Service aside from that was polite, but again nothing to write home about. No one asked if my food was good until I was halfway done.  So, no bonus points for service.  I saw several other plates of food that all looked fantastic - and since it's a nice place and not chain food I'll probably try it again while I'm here this weekend.",

The food is your standard breakfast fare, but it is the service that really makes this place stand out. Everyone who works here is very friendly, and the manager always comes up and says hello to all of the regulars. I also like the fact that you can get breakfast up until 2:30 in the afternoon. Try this place the next time you are downtown!",

The poached egg was done perfectly, the sauce on top was quite nice, and the capers really set off the flavor. So, good food, good service, in an ideal setting took me back to a little European cafe that we used to frequent when I was working abroad. What is not to like? To top it off, the prices are very reasonable ... maybe a bit expensive for Phoenix, but on balance, was quite reasonable. Good experience.",

I found the Breakfast Club on yelp because I hadn't eaten breakfast yet and I was in a mood for coffee and eggs. Great choice! I sat at the counter, and the friendly waitress immediately offered me something to drink. I asked for a cup of coffee with a shot of hazelnut flavor and Stevia. My server recommended the grilled breakfast sourdough sandwich with Fontina. Since I don't eat bacon, she offered a substitute. She said I could switch it to Avocado. Lovely! That automatically gained her extra stars. I love establishments that offer a substitute without extra added fees, so I recommend Breakfast Club. Delish, reasonable and great service too!",

We weren't greet it upon entrance nor did they explained the menu as we had mentioned it was our first time here. However, we still stayed, considering how hard it is to park here in down town; we figure what the heck why not!! It got worst!! They really weren't that busy, a few min later she came back to take out drink order, then ten min later out order. They took forever, she never around to refill out drinks, or even asked if we needed anything else. But she was very attentive of her friends sitting along in the bar giving them mimosas making sure they were taken care of. Plus not to mention both managers who's name I catch was David talking about their employees while sitting near customers. No wonder why they lack in theirs customer service. Their leadership needs major work ! If i could rate this plc it would of been ZERO !!!! But their wasn't a option.",

If not, you are on your own and may wait a good while for service.   Such is the case today. My female friend and I ( both professionally dressed as we are lawyers) met for lunch. Tables were full so we sat at the counter for about ten minutes without anyone acknowledging us or clearing the previous occupant's dirty dishes away.    The waitress was busy flirting with a couple of male customers. Although she saw us, she ignored us so we moved to another portion of the counter closer to where she was flirting.  We finally got some service after about another five minutes.   Food was ok.  And this isn't the first time I've been ignored at the counter in lieu of a male customer.  Silly me for going back.

The french toast was decent, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It was a good portion size but you definitely need a sweet tooth to finish it. Overall, it was mediocre.",

She quickly returned with my drink, took my order, and plopped it down on my table about 5 minutes later. Again: fine. Although I notice others have time to actually enjoy their drinks. But what really drove me crazy is  she gave me my check. With my food. A quick glance around and I see that not one other table with diners had a bill waiting for them as they ate.",

He was great the whole time so my first impression I soon forgot . The Latte was delicious however the first glass had lipstick on it . Made me another quickly and it's honestly one of the better lattes I have had .   Eggs Benedict was great , food overall was pretty good .

The people are friendly, location is great, and there's plenty of outdoor seating for when the weather is beautiful like it is right now.",

Every time I go I'm never disappointed. The wait is never too long although it can be quite lengthy on Sunday mornings which is not an issue for me, I've even downloaded that app that informs you on your place in line. The staff is always delightful. Never had an issue. The outside seating is lovely and I love the location. I try to go as often as possible.",

The girls had the Bird omelet-stuffed with mushrooms, avocado, turkey and Boursin cheese. Delicious! The avocados were perfectly ripe, something Chicago chefs need to learn. Good coffee-not too bitter and they are very generous with the half & half-gave us a pint at least! Great service from Natalie and food came out in less than 10 minutes! Highly recommended!",

What else would he do he made the mistake. The manager comes over and says sorry he never put the order in but I won't charge you. Like for real I didn't eat it why would you charge me. Then she ask would you like a piece French toast take home I replied I wanted it with my food she says sorry what else can I get you. Never made effort to discount my bill or make it right.",

My friends and I enjoyed our lunch and we thought nothing of it. We all left fair tips and went about our day. Two of my friends and I threw our receipts away without verifying the correct amount had posted to our bank accounts (we all either used debit or credit cards). Our other friend balances her accounts monthly and noticed that our server had changed the tip amount after we left! She made a $2 tip into a $3 tip! $1 isn't a big deal but it is fraudulent behavior and it is theft. I'm sure it adds up. It could have happened to all four of us that day but three of us didn't do our due diligence and check our accounts!  My friend contacted the BC and spoke with Gino, the manager. He took the information and then asked if my friend wanted her $1 back. Well, it's not worth driving all the way down there to get $1.   I won't post the server's name but everyone beware! We don't know if she will remain employed at the BC but you can never be too safe! If I were the manager, this behavior would not be tolerated. It hurts the reputation so badly. Check your receipt and your bank account after you dine here. Now I certainly will not be returning.",

Walking into the restaurant everything about it says Traditional American Diner, with the exception of the young friendly gals who all deserve the title hot stuff after their names. I am able to praise the unequaled attention on the interior design. Smart colors with clean, precise lines. Modern in style, with several large glass doors that open to any beautiful weather and an outdoor patio. I sit at the counter.  I am staring at a twenty thousand dollar Italian coffee machine for the professional with all the necessities next to it. This company is doing business with world class coffee artisans. Miscela d'Oro Coffee cup accessories are in the house. And most importantly, I learn the beans are purchased from Brazil and roasted in Italy. I order a quad before I learn they do a French Press, a disposable paper and plastic cup \"afetiere a piston,\" which is a simple coffee brewing and filtering device that has evolved into a four dollar atomic strength coffee to go. You have to see it.  The menu has something for everyone.

So I basically paid $7.50 for a grilled cheese (which was more bread than cheese) for her. Her lemonade was to Sour no sweet for me. She liked it though. The frozen coffee was good.

I ordered the veggie wrap which the menu boasted to be filled with a variety of veggies.  There was half a mushroom and the rest was warm soggy spinach. It was terrible! I actually opened the wrap to see if there was anything else inside and found nothing other than that one sliver of mushroom and a sliver of sun dried tomato. Whoever rolled the wrap must have done so wrong because after pushing plate to the side and just asking for a small Caesar salad I dumped out the other half of wrap and it was filled with nothing but mushrooms. The server just dismissed it when I mentioned my displeasure with the wrap and didn't even offer an apology. Breakfast sitting at the bar area has always been great and I guess I will just have to stick with that. Never bringing a client back here.",

The waitress said it was because they were brewing a fresh pot. Eh-I suppose 11:45am is a little late to expect coffee to be ready to go. (She offered me a cup to go as we were paying the bill which made up for it anyway) Food here= perfectly prepared, well thought flavor combinations, and unique ingredients. The french toast made with challah bread is probably the best French toast I've ever had-AND they offer 100% pure maple syrup. I've also had The Bird omelet-and all I can say is WOW. Only complaint is that it was huge and I felt the need to finish every last delicious bite. That being said-you could definitely split any of their omelets or French toast with a willing friend or spouse. My husband got the Benedict with portabella mushrooms and it was equally as delicious. The mushrooms tasted marinated and roasted at the same time and had a slightly sweet/sour taste to pair w the saltiness of the egg and the creaminess of the hollandaise sauce.",

Unfortunately, that didn't happen at the Breakfast Club. My table had 4 different benes. The common denominator was an overcooked, almost hard-boiled egg. So shameful in the world of Eggs Benedict lovers.  On top of that, the hollandaise sauce was so thick and tasted like a butter cream. Potatoes were ok but should have more of a crisp.  The good thing about my brunch was that I sat at the tables outside and it was a nice day out. Made me a little more forgiving about the food. Probably won't be back.",

It came with fruit, potatoes, and a big fluffy omelette stuffed with onions and bell peppers. The granola is perfect for a healthy lighter option that is still full of flavor. I'm here for business and eating out every meal and this place has been my favorite.  I came for a second time, it was that good. They actually let me substitute the side of potatoes for whatever I wanted. I got the small cup of granola instead. This place is great and very accommodating!",

She wishes she could have that yogurt every day.  Half her sandwich will be fir lunch. I had a cup of Irish oatmeal with almond milk and raisins and brown sugar. Then I had 2 eggs with bacon and sour dough toast and fresh fruit consisting of slices if cantaloupe, pineapple, melon and watermelon. Everything was very good. Service was excellent our waiter Jordan was on top of his game.",

Definitely call 30 minutes ahead to get your name on the list for weekend brunch, as this is a happening spot, and it decreases your wait time.  The food was average, with big portions. Wait staff was fairly inattentive during our visit, and I wondered if she would ever bring the check. She did, and the prices for the portions make a good value.   Restroom is way back in a back hallway. Felt a little dark and dirty. Because it is so popular, the space has pretty terrible acoustics for visiting with friends.   Overall, just an average experience. I would go back, but my needs might be better served in a quieter location.",

It also came with potatoes which were okay but lacked seasoning and it came with fruit which was rip and a good portion.

If I had the choice again I'd try and find Denny's or iHOP in the area; roughly the same taste and cheaper.",

It was a nice morning so we chose to sit outside on the patio which I very much recommend. (Amazing people watching as it's in a business park type area). To eat I had a mushroom, spinach, ham, and cheese omelette with pepper jack and cheddar cheese. The omelette was great. Not one bad thing to say and this was only 11 dollars and it came with potato's, and fresh fruit. Everything was on point the potatoes came with yellow and red peppers which gave off a nice spice-kick.  The high light of the morning  was the potatoes. I don't know how they did it but it was perfectly crisp with spice. It's rare that the side is better than the main dish. All hail the mighty potato. Recommended!!!",

The portions are very big and my husband, for the first time, didn't finish his food because he got so full. My breakfast sandwich was delicious, the pancakes are a good size (unlike many restaurants) and the potatoes are yummmm! My husband's omelette was, in his words, the best omelette he's ever had and he devoured his pancakes. He now wants to return with friends and family to introduce them to this gem!",

    "text": "I agree with other Yelpers when they say that this place is a solid 3.5 stars. This weekend, we are in town and staying at the Hotel Palomar, which is a short walk to this restaurant. We woke up really early Saturday morning, due to the NCAA Championship Fan Center outside of our window blasting music at 6AM, and called downstairs to see where the best places for breakfast were in the area. She recommended the Breakfast Club since it had a variety of dishes and was a close walk. We decided to go here and had a decent experience. This place doesn't stick out to me and I don't think I would personally rush back here anytime soon (if I found myself back in the area). The portions were generous and the restaurant was large - both good things, considering there are plenty of seats and two people could share an entree.   FOOD: 3 stars. Very average, overall. I ordered a single blueberry pancake and he ordered the waffle with granola and fresh berries (which we split), as well as the Monster Burrito with both the chile and queso on the side. I think the waffle was the best item, followed by the pancake, and lastly the burrito. The waffle tasted pretty good, but I though that the granola and berries took away from the flavor of the waffle itself. If we were to order it again, I would opt for something lighter. The pancake was good and really big, but a little dry. The burrito was, in my opinion, terrible. We only took one bite each, and both decided it was dry and didn't taste that well. Definitely ask the server what they recommend because the waffle was really good!  SERVICE: 4 stars. The service was pretty good/average. Not outstanding but also not a bad thing to say about it.  LOCATION: 5 stars Conveniently located in a nice area of Downtown Phoenix. If you're staying in the Palomar or around there, it's out on the second floor level of restaurants and shops. Very spacious and a lot of room to sit!",

It has a kiosk where you can get little sandwiches & drinks. Something my boyfriend & I found interesting is  you can get a side of filet minon! Overall, nice place to get breakfast or brunch, but can be pretty loud or packed, so if you're looking for a more quiet place to have a nice breakfast perhaps look elsewhere.

Exit the elevator and turn right. 5. Arrive at restaurant and wait to be seated.   They have the best french toast I have ever had in my life! They make it with challah bread which makes it so it isn't soggy, but still fluffy and sweet. Both types of French toast are great, if you choose the signature French toast you'll get real fresh berries, not the goop that people put in pies.   You can eat inside which is beautiful and very clean, or outside which is very nice, but the tables are up high, so I can imagine for those who are mobility handicapped it would be tough to sit outside. There is dedicated handicapped seating inside.   If you get orange juice, you'll get a good size glass instead of the tiny ones at most restaurants.   \"\"Be careful with the prices though! A frappuccino costs $6 :( (although it was delicious)",

Very attentive and exceeded expectations with her energy. We split a full order of pancakes w strawberries & whipped cream along with an amazing omelet called Green Chili Chicken. 5 star experience!!   Sunday though Jesse was our waiter and he only had about 3 tables but never refilled our water, only stopped by our table twice the whole time, & was very inefficient when he walked by us multiple times without stopping. Then brought us our check by laying it down- not even asking if we needed anything. We ordered The Bird and it was average. Low in flavor and needed hot sauce (but wasn't getting that from Jesse) and the French toast was good but not as great as the pancakes. 2-3 star experience.   This place is always busy so expect a 10-30 minute wait especially if you want to sit outside. They'll text you when your table is ready. Overall the ambience is great and the food is well priced and tasty. Sorry that we couldn't give it 5 stars after our 2nd dine in.",

For example, I ordered something off the menu and the girl working the kiosk during lunch today told me they didn't have that or most of the things listed on the menu. When I found something on the menu that they did actually have, she told me it was double the price..(sorry, what?!) I finally found a salad on the menu that was the price listed on the menu (revolutionary) bought it and left. Back at my office I realize she didn't give me utensils or salad dressing...yum.",

    "text": "I'm starting to appreciate the concept of a little more of an upscale breakfast. LONG gone are my undergrad days at NAU when we'd stumble into Mike and Rhonda's at 6am (because we'd been up drinking all night) and couldn't give two shits that the chicken was grossly under-cooked and still partly frozen.  So now I'm a grown-up(ish) and popped in here for brekkie the other day. To clarify, when I say \"upscale breakfast\" that means a TINY 4 oz breakfast fillet, two eggs (I appreciate that they asked if I wanted them poached soft, medium or hard-this made the difference between 3 and 4 stars-WELL DONE (not my steak or eggs!!!)) LOTS of hashbrowns which I ordered as a side, two pieces of toast and some fruit which was all artfully arranged.  Their fresh squeezed OJ was the highlight of the breakfast. Everything else was good, not stellar. If you're looking for value for money, look elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, I left feeling full but some folks may feel cheated when they get the bill, relative to what they got.   I personally liked the service, the bright cheery atmosphere and that I left feeling full but not stuffed. Another bonus that they gave me a refill on my coffee to go. I keep forgetting that these guys are just a few blocks from my work. This is the kind of place  that I would remember if I were visiting Phoenix from out of town.",

I ordered the lox, bagels and cream cheese while my bf ordered the bird omelette. Both were great and worth the wait. Service was fast. The only con was our server. She was nice but I never even got her name. She took our order,checked on us once and that was it. She was also busy so I still gave 5 stars! And most importantly can't forget pet friendly!!!",

Monica O. didn't seem to bothered by them loosing her reservation and I arrived late so I guess I shouldn't complain but I have to subtract 1/2 star since it's just unprofessional. Also have to subtract 1/2 star more because they didn't have the huevos con masa which is my favorite dish at the Scottsdale location. Instead I tried the huevos rancheros. This was prepared pretty differently from how it is usually done at other restaurants. The pork green chilli and refried black beans were very, very tasty but for me the dish fell flat since it was served on a soft tortilla-ish wrap that wasn't even toasted or anything so I was really missing the crunch from the tostada shell that I was expecting. It was still pretty good food, though. But I doubt I will ever come here again since the Scottsdale location is easier to get to/park and has a better menu. Also, the decor here matched the Scottsdale location's post-remodel asthetic but lacked the same charm.  One note on their house made V-18 \"juice\" since I tried this for the first time. It really bears no resemblance to to V-8 juice. Think of it more like a vegetable smoothie or even a pureed gazpacho in a glass. I am not saying that's a bad thing, just be aware. I did finish it, but it took a while.",

    "text": "So, my sister and her family were in town, and got a good deal @ the downtown Hyatt.  CityScape is close, and they went to breakfast @ The Breakfast Club on Friday morning.  My sister is on a very strict dietary regimen, and they were able to accommodate her with a side of broccoli for breakfast.  So, she wanted to go back there for breakfast on Saturday.  I am always up for trying new things, especially breakfast.  And I'm pretty sure this place made a \"best of\" list I'd recently read.  So I agreed...despite my deep desire to go to Matt's.  I wanted to support my sister and her quest for better health, so I took one for the team.  Our server was fabulous.  She was efficient and remembered my sister's dietary needs from the previous day.  That's why they get 2 stars.  I found the setting quite generic.  The selection of pancakes/waffles/french toast was not at all tempting.  I got the basic eggs/bacon/toast/fruit combo with a side of potatoes.  Food came promptly, and was ok.  This is what really bothered me.  There were no condiments on the table without request.  My toast was dry, so thank goodness they asked if I wanted any jam when they took my order.  I know some people like their toast dry.  But I like mine with butter.  REAL BUTTER.  They asked if we wanted any hot sauce or ketchup.  We said \"yes.\"  They brought us an assortment of hot sauces, and a tray with 4 little dishes of ketchup.  Nobody wanted any ketchup, so that was so much waste of time, energy and product.  This place is VERY generic.  I will not be returning, because there are so many more interesting and locally-owned options for breakfast downtown.  Oh, and Faux News does not help the atmosphere...just saying...",

The food was better than average, I really liked my Grilled Cheese breakfast sandwich, my fiancee really liked the french toast. The fresh-squeezed OJ and pineapple juice were really good too, but overpriced. Service was mostly competent and we had no complaints other than that the food was a little slow coming out. The order were correct the first time, and the waitress checked up on us frequently. We had a little bit of sticker shock, but the food was good enough to bring us back Sunday for breakfast again.   In general, we like this place, and we will be back when we are downtown around breakfast time, but likely won't go out of the way to go here.  PS: I know there were a lot of complaints about the service at the bar, and we knew that before we went to TBC, so we specifically chose to not sit at the bar, but I kept an eye on it. The bar remained packed even when the restaurant wasn't, and people seemed generally happy, so they may have fixed the bar service problem. I saw this on both days, so it wasn't just a fluke.",

The turkey was very good as was the overall omelet.  I had the Huevos Rancheros which came on a Chipotle tortilla with a good amount of pork and black beans as well as black beans. Yum. We came with 4 other people who are pretty picky due to dietary restrictions and personal preferences.  Everybody found something they liked on the menu.  The mushroom omelet was quite good and our really picky eater had the fruit, granola and buckwheat pancake and was happy for a change. Lots of choices for sides at a reasonable price.  Service was good.  Only complaint is we went on a Sunday morning.  SO busy which resulted in our check being delivered shortly after our food came and we were all still eating.  I HATE that.  I'm pretty sure that is a management/training issue so I did not complain to the server.  I know they want to turn tables every 60 minutes or less but I personally do not want to see a check until after I have been given the courtesy to finish my meal.  I don't think that's a lot to ask for.  Will I go back? Absolutely.  The other negative is parking is difficult.",

I got the Bird omelette - over cooked and under flavored in a big way. Coffee was good but  the creamer was so old it curdled my friend's coffee. Service wasn't great. Definitely not a destination breakfast spot. I'd only go again if I was nearby and not in the mood for something special.",

This morning it was packed and they could not handle it...there must not have been a manager because everyone was running around and the place was a mess. When we were finally seated I ordered my usual iced mocha. After 10 minutes our sever apologized for the coffe not being ready, as it was being made by Mark the barista. When I did get my coffee, thank god I stirred it up because there was a balled up napkin in it! I gave it back and Mark replied that he had just made it and it wasn't like that (like I had done it to my own coffee). He made a new one and rudely brought it to our table without even looking at me. To top it off he made the WRONG kind. I get it, they were busy and people make mistakes. A simple sorry or pretending like he cared would have made the situation better.  The food is good but we've had too many experiences with mark and a few others there that we won't be going back.",

We eat there often so I was excited to hear about the downtown opening, especially because her and I are both to to school downtown. My husband and I eat here frequently as well. The website indicates they are open until 3pm, but my husband called last week at 2:15 to confirm they were open until 3 and the girl who answered the phone said they were already closed. He informed her what the website said to which she quickly responded \"they close whenever they feel like it.\" We eat there often (4-5 times a month) and the staff are extremely wonderful so maybe the girl was new??? One of the servers even remembered our order from the week prior which I always think is nice when a server takes note of the regulars! Hopefully the rude girl was a fluke because it seemed so out of character!! Great food, great vibe!!! Definitely recommended!!",

As HORRIBLE as the food was, I have never received such horendous customer service!  Our server was Kendyl.  She not only has no idea what is served in her establishment, she has no idea what customer service truly is.  At one point, she apologized for her attitude by telling us that she was tired because she works two jobs and she didn't get enough sleep the night before.  Not only is that not my fault, it shouldn't be my problem.  Our greeting took forever, our ordering was drawn out due to her back-and-forth to the kitchen to ask questions, our drinks were wrong (3 times), our food was wrong and missing items, and then our check took forever because she had to get an item removed.  We were one of only three tables in this restaurant on a Saturday morning.  There were numerous servers, baristas/bartenders, and even a manager, not only roaming around the restaurant but leaning on the host stand with nothing to do.  Is it that hard for the manager (who stood out like a sore thumb) to do a table touch with the three tables in his establishment?!?!?!  Not only will I never visit this restaurant again, but I will try to disuade everyone I can from going.  If I could rate lower than one star I would!",

My boyfriend and I walked in on a fairly dead Sunday around lunchtime and saw staff abound -- but no one greeted us, showed us to a table or even looked up. A few minutes later, the woman behind the bar shouted that we could sit wherever. Ten minutes later, and we still hadn't been visited by a server or gotten menus. We finally asked a busser if he could bring us some menus and he seemed put out. When a server did come over, she was neither the slightest bit apologetic or friendly. Something so simple as hiring friendly waitstaff can make or break a restaurant. If the food was stellar, we might return, but it was \"meh\" -- passable, but not anything I'm craving to go back for, which is unfortunate as the location is great.",

I was so excited to have The Breakfast Club open in downtown and now I hazard to say even First Watch (which is hospital cuisine at best) far exceeds what I had at the Breakfast Club in CityScape.  I've now been to this restaurant three times since it opened hoping for an exceptional experience and I'm totally underwhelmed.  Today, I brought 2 family members to the restaurant and even though the service was exceptional, the quality of the food was horrible and it was all cold.  We had pre-cooked cardboard bacon, flavorless sausage patties, petite pancakes, and ice cold eggs.  Plating was haphazard and uninviting and worse of all, every hot dish was ice cold.  Since I was already at this location 2 times and each time I had to send food back because it was cold, I knew to order my syrup hot.  That was the only way we could eat the pancakes without sending them back.  Considering this is a breakfast restaurant, I can't believe they find it so difficult to serve hot, flavorful food.  I really hope they immediately step up their effort because Matt's Big Breakfast, Cartel Coffee, and sadly First Watch have nothing to worry about.  I've waited too long to see downtown Phoenix succeed and unfortunately without remedial action, the Breakfast Club will not be a part of it.",

I came here with a coworker for lunch the waiter came right away to greet us we placed our order I order signature French toast and 2 eggs with cheese for my drink I went with coffee. When the coffee was delivered it was cold (Red flag 1)... So I informed my waiter and he brought me a new one. We informed him we only had an hour when he first took our order so he brought our check with the hot coffee correction to speed things along. My coworker notice her order was messed up from the ticket so she called him back to fix the order being placed for her (Red flag 2) I paid for my food once he took the ticket to correct for my coworker plus a tip (we had separate tickets)... When my food arrived my eggs were cold and no toppings accompanied my French Toast (why me?? Red Flag 3)?? I asked my waiter where the topping were he realized yet again that he placed the wrong order... But this time for me. So he stated that he could bring me toppings right out which he did do along with an additional ticket to charge for the topping?? (Flag 4... If it's your error and I tipped there should be no additional charge but okay i was going to pay because i needed the topppings)  THE FRUIT WAS MOLDED!!! (Red Flag 5-100) So at this point I'm late to return to work with cold MOLDED food the only thing the waiter came up with is I don't have to pay the additional ticket for toppings... DUH)!! So needless to say I'm STARVING after going to lunch with no food in my stomach and paid $15 smh never again!! Thank God I saw the mold or this post would have been about me catching food poisoning from here!! Be very careful here... If there toppings are MOLDED what else is MOLDED in that kitchen??

Clearly they take pride in what they do and have honed their skills to the point that they (uncannily) are able to anticipate just about everything.  Thinking about a cup of coffee to go?  It appears on the counter with your check.  Contemplating a no carb breakfast, all options-- including possible substitutions-- are presented.  During my brief time in the restaurant, it was clear that everyone who worked at BC genuinely cared about their clientele.  A woman named Betty walked in and an iced tea was waiting along with an english muffin prepared specially for her.  Was it called in ahead of time?  Not according to Betty: \"they somehow know.\"  Just about everyone who entered the front door was greeted by name.    If you've ever wanted to experience what 'flow' in a restaurant looks like, the counter at Breakfast Club is your place.  Sit back and let the staff take care of the rest.",

Yes, the management (the dark haired guy that sits at the bar )  is clumped in this mess of an operation too, since he is no more accommodating than the server with an attitude, especially when the error is on their behalf.  After this experience, the Breakfast Club no longer exist  and will never again be considered an eating option. I will be sure to pass this on to the workplace (as Cityscape is the go-to for breakfast and lunch for many nearby employees).  $15-20 round these parts can get you breakfast, lunch and drink with a smile!

I was not upset that the sandwich was incorrect in the first place, but the fact that the waitress just picked off the bacon and then lied to me was outrageous. If I was wanted it being picked off I would have used my own hands! Further, when I showed her the sandwich she did not even apologize.

I don't even know what my boyfriend ate, I was too in love with the breakfast grilled cheese.  Which was so good I tried to make one at home the next morning and failed miserably.  Can't wait to take my parents here when they come to town!",

    "text": "This is a 3 out of 5 day stop for me now.  I have to admit that I haven't strayed from the Breakfast Grilled Cheese sandwich for the last few weeks.  Its THAT good.  Its not really productive for review writing, though.   Lately I've modified the sandwich to sub wheat instead of white, and egg whites instead of egg normals.  Personally, its better now.  I love the taste of egg anything and the whites give a good uniform egg taste.  The size of the sandwich hasn't changed; still huge.  I couldn't finish it one sitting anymore.  So I started ordering half a sandwich which isn't on the menu, but the folks there make it for me anyway.  I have unfortunately paid like 3 different prices for it since different people take the order.  Half a sandwich should be half the price, but its usually only about $2 off.  Whatever. I'd be better off just getting the whole thing and saving the other half for lunch. The sandwich's price went up $2 since my first review...so did a LOT of other items.  I knew they would modify their menu, but I didn't think they'd go up so much on so many things.  Oh well.  Its two steps away from me and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese is probably all I'll ever buy.  So yeah they got me. Another reason other than the sandwich that they'll keep four stars is their service.  I order as soon as they open at 7am and every person is always friendly.  I've gotten offered samples of their awesome OJ or apple juice while I wait.  And there are two of the folks that recognize me now.  Service and plain ol' friendliness goes a long way with me. I'll be going here as long as their there.",

    "text": "I have honestly never written a 1 star review of anywhere in Arizona, but have to after an experience I had today. I cannot offer any review of the food, because we never received food. We did not even receive customer service because that would require that a restaurant acknowledges you. So this review is based off of a lack of customer service as well as an observation of the state of the kitchen.   I originally walked up to the to-go area and the woman working there was pleasant and directed me to the restaurant for food. This is where the positive story ends. I went to the restaurant to meet my boss who is an executive at a nonprofit in Arizona. When she walked in the door, there was water on the floor so she slipped and fell on the ground. Thankfully she was not injured, and made her way to my table. We sat, for literally 25 minutes, and were never acknowledged, given water, eye contact, or a chance to order. A manager never came to inquire if she was okay, though we did see them attempt to wipe up the floor. It was not especially busy and the restaurant was well staffed. There were tables on both sides of us with businessmen getting prompt service, drinks, and food orders. Literally every other occupied table in the restaurant had a man and each of them were getting drinks and food. Maybe I missed a sign on the door of this prehistoric establishment and they only serve men?! We could not so much as make eye contact with any of the servers. We could see into the kitchen and were disturbed to see water pouring out of a vent in the ceiling and an inch of thick dust/grime atop one of the kitchen appliances. The front door of the restaurant was also opened even though it was hot and humid outside. (This is a health code violation.) We will be in touch with our contact at Maricopa County Environmental Health Services to report the water on the floor and in the kitchen, as well as the open door.   After 10 minutes of no service we joked we would only have time for coffee prior to another meeting we had at CityScape. After 25 minutes we exited out the door without even an acknowledgement or apology. A truly confusing, disturbing, frustrating, and time wasting experience! I would never ever recommend this establishment to anyone. Maybe if you're a businessman you will get service!",

BUT we keep coming back because the food is always delicious. I had my last straw on May 27 my friend and I went with her toddlers sat for 20 minutes with no service (while we saw other around us get service and food and people that came AFTER us got SERVICE AND FOOD) my friend was livid and wanted to leave I decided to stay because I come from Avondale and really wanted to eat at the moment I literally had to get up from my table go to the bar and ask for service. Once the service came she said she did not know we were her table even though she served everyone else around her. We order food it came it was cold yay! After this my friend was just done we order the check it came gave my debit card came back to let me know what color my card was because she could not find it! Yes they lost my debit card for 10 minutes had all the waiters looking around and asking me if I WAS SURE I had put it in the sleeve trying to give me the side eye of it, as I am trying to freeze my card she came back and found it. Charge me the full amount and I am a 20% tipper but this was literally the worst experience in my adult life. Never again will I be going and neither will my family and my friend.",

The out door patio where I chose to dine at both visits is very comfortable and situated between two high rises. You may have to search for the restaurant due to it being located on the second floor next to the Tilted Kilt.  The service is fast and the food is very good. Today I had the bananas foster waffle which had great flavor. The waffle took up the entire plate and all the ingredients where fresh. My other two guests had biscuits and gravy and they loved it.  I would recommend The Breakfast Club.",

The outside area didn't look like it was part of the restaurant, it looked like it was part of the kiosk. So we didn't even bother to say anything. After a 45 minute wait, they sat us outside and only then told us it would be even longer to wait for an inside table. Had we known, we would've gone somewhere else from the beginning. Service was minimal. Except for taking our order and bringing our food, they never came by to refill drinks or ask if we needed anything (tabasco, syrup, condiments, etc). My glass had a huge crack in it. The food was fine. Not fantastic, but not bad. If the food were amazing, I'd have put up with everything else, but it was just fine. I probably would not eat here again.",

Highly recommend all of them, especially the french toast and turkey BLT with sweet potato fries. The fresh squeezed juices are a real treat, too. Build your own mimosa for $25 is pretty enticing.

The first day, I ordered the BC Signature French Toast, which had 3 pieces of toast with fresh berries, candied almonds and walnuts, and powdered sugar, with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The grapefruit juice was definitely freshly squeezed, because it was so sour! But good and fresh. The french toast wasn't anything spectacular I think, and it honestly didn't have much flavor. It was also very difficult to eat, because the berries and walnuts wouldn't fit on the fork easily with toast.  The second day, I ordered full stack pancake with chocolate chips inside and strawberries + whipped cream on top, and I got a pineapple juice. There were 3 pancakes, and, like the toast, they didn't have much flavor. The whipped cream and strawberries were pretty low on quantity. The whipped cream wasn't very thick and was very sweet, and it melted at a quick rate. The pineapple juice, unlike the grapefruit juice, was very sweet, and I was trying to see whether there was syrup in it. I'm not sure. But it didn't take very strongly of pineapple, and it was very yellow.  The service both days was pretty good though! The waiters and waitresses are friendly, and they come by occasionally to ask how everything is.",

Good food, drinks and service. We got the basic breakfast, a half order of French toast and the Cali bene. We got the iced coffee, a hot coffee, oj. The iced coffee is my favorite, so much better then anywhere else I have ever had (Even Starbucks).The oj was also fresh, didn't taste like it was from a jug. The eggs on the basic breakfast were cold, but the rest of the food was warm. We ordered pretty quick when we sat at the bar but seemed we waited about 20 min for our food and other people who got there after were already getting their food. We paid $38 before tip, I was surprised one slice of French toast was $7 but the servers were very efficient helping and working together since it was pretty busy, the restaurant was clean. We will def be back.",

My taste buds are very happy and I'm a picky person about food. The avocado really made this dish. A little extra salty, but that's to be expected with the pork and tortilla chip. Great service, but it wasn't packed so there's that.   -fresh ingredients!! -Great coffee (Cold Brew for me) -Fresh squeezed juices & Lemonade -Alcoholic beverages (I want to come back and have a brunch with these) -TVs above the breakfast bar visible to the rest of the restaurant -big patio -kiosk out front if you are in a hurry  Top 5 in The basin. I will be back for sure.",

We must have gotten in as soon as they opened because we were seated right away and there was a rush shortly after we were seated. Saaweet!  Having been wanting to try the Scottsdale location I already knew what I wanted, \"Lets get some f**king French toast!\"  Maybe I hyped myself up or maybe fellow yelpers got a better batch than me idk? But I gotta say I wasn't too pleased with the BC Signature French Toast. It wasn't disgusting or anything just kind of hyped up? It wasn't anything special to be honest. Just French toast with a couple berries on top and a couple of candies pecans on top. Bleh. :kanye shrug: maybe it was me Maybe it was BC this day not sure but I definitely won't be getting that again if I come back. I wish the French toast would have been as good as I imagined it to be because the location is cool! I can imagine myself throwing back a couple mimosas, shoot maybe the whole champagne bottle, I saw they have brunch specials on mimosas wink wink, but definitely passing on the BC French Toast",

She was outgoing and organized.  Most of the waitstaff are early twenty-somethings who really know the area.  She gave us a lot of information about what to do in the Phoenix area.  We ordered the usual breakfast fare, but the huevos rancheros I had was most excellent.  They have some unusual breakfast items that my family took advantage of like fruit-type pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes and so on.  Everything was excellent.  Will definitely return when we're in Phoenix again.  Keep up the great job Breakfast Club!!!",

They are located on the 2nd floor area of the Kimpton building, across from EOS Fitness entrance. Not labeled well, so look for doors with a \"BC\" on them.  They have boozey breakfast drinks, juices, coffee, tea and loads of breakfast food options. The kiosk in the middle of the outdoor area is for to-go items, but they do not have nearly as much, no breakfast food it seemed and just drinks. I initially asked the restaurant if I could order to-go, they sent me to the kiosk and I returned to just dine in.  Home run: -quick service and food at the bar -all my egg white omlet changes were correct, can get fruit in lieu of taters -hot sauces -bacon was quite tasty -mocha was delicious and not too huge  Meh: -kiosk only really has drinks and quickie lunch items. I can't figure out how to order breakfast to-go -would appreciate being able to switch any egg item for egg whites, but I'm not sure if that's possible  Props to the bartender that allowed me to go retrieve my wallet after I reliazed at the end that I didn't have it. He trusted me to return and pay, as I did. Much appreciated.",

But then, they had more outdoor seating under the yellow Sunbrellas behind the cafe structure. I walked into the restaurant and got a seat at the bar, since I was alone.   They had a good amount of seating at the bar, also lots of indoor seating as well. It was not as busy as I thought, which was good for me since I got to get a seat right away. The hostess was friendly and nice, welcomed me with a warm smile as soon as I walked in.  I ordered an interesting item that is called \"V-18\" which is their version of Veggie Juice. The V-18 came out in a deep, bright red, like a typical V-8 drink. The large was really large, the same size as their big water glass. It was very strong and powerful, I tasted mainly tomato, with some veggies. It woke me right up with a good amount of spice. Tasty, high quality and very filling.  For food, I chose Biscuits & Gravy. This thing was HUGE! I didn't realize how bit it was going to be... The gravy was nice and creamy, didn't have much sausage in it from what I could see. The biscuit had a tiny little kick to it from jalapeno, which was nice. It was fluffy, but at the same time, a bit too dry.  The entire time I was having my breakfast, no one came to check on me.  And because of that, it took a while to get the bill, and to pay the bill. It would be nicer if I didn't feel like I was forgotten at the bar...",

They had about one employee for every table so it wasn't like they were that busy. Coffee was ok. I like the Havana latte at LGO much better though. We both had the Breakfast Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Hash Browns, Bacon, Eggs & Fontina on Grilled Sourdough) aka cholesterol killer. It was decent but nothing special.  After we ate here this morning I was mentioning it to a friend of mine and she had eaten here before. She said the coffee was good, the Omlet wasn't so great and her companion stated \"the server has as much personality as when I'm sleeping.\". We must have had the same server.

I really enjoyed my breakfast here, and I will probably go back in a few days.  The eggs were very good (two fried, two scrambled), the whole wheat toast had a great flavor with just the right amount of butter, and the fruit was fresh.  However, the highlight of the meal for me was the homestyle potatoes.  The edges were crisp, and they were cooked with red and green peppers which gave the potatoes a great flavor.  The only disappointment was the bacon, which I would classify as below-average bacon.  Maybe the chef had an off day.  The rest of the breakfast was so enjoyable that I am willing to give the chef a mulligan on the bacon.  Additionally, their outdoor seating was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast outside in Phoenix's beautiful November weather!",

Had \"The Bird\" omelette and it was delicious. Portions are large and very high quality. Would highly recommend this restaurant when downtown. Only regret is I had to work and couldn't have a drink. Very generous pours on screwdrivers and bloody Mary's!!",

    "text": "I see a lot complaints about the service but on this occasion our service was great. We were greeted promptly by the hostess, the person I assume was the manager and two of the servers. One server even commented on my family's accidently matching attire. Shortly after receiving our menus the server took our drink order.   Things were going well.  Then our food came out. My wife's food was missing some of the ingredients listed on the menu. The server corrected this quickly. Otherwise her french toast order was fine if not, by my tastes, underwhelming. My wife thought it was fine.  I had ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Half of the plate was covered with shredded lettuce. The rest of the plate consisted of black beans, pork green chile and 2 eggs. The green was bland and I would've like to have seen more. The eggs were over done, not runny at all. (sad face here)  Also being a relatively cheap person I had a bit of sticker shock. The OJ was fresh squeezed, my niece had a large and my wife had large mimosa. I didn't feel that their french toast was a good value at $10.  Bottom line is I won't go back and I won't recommend this place. Their are several other downtown breakfast locations that I think are better.",

I can only surmise that the have an over abundance of customers and are trying to shoo the excess away or they are quite confident that their food will make people forget about the service. Well....not this customer....too many restaurants serving good food and friendly service to ever bother with this place again....",

We frequent the Scottsdale location, but decided to go to the downtown location (since it is close to our church).  We were received by a pleasant greeter. The waiter was new and couldn't answer many of our questions, but Scott -- the manager-- came to the rescue! He came out of the kitchen and as he approached our table he noticed we were preparing the bless our food. Scott intervened, joined hands, and said the blessing himself! What a surprise! Even though we were not prepared to \"light into him\" he certainly difused any less than stellar thoughts we were harboring. Scott knows customer service!  The food was good; the fellowship was great; and we will return!  Thank you, Scott, for making what could have been a lackluster experience a very pleasant one!",

The two of us shared their signature French toast, breakfast bagel and a side of bacon.  This place has good bacon. The cuts are girthy, long and perfectly salty. We both enjoyed the French toast though I think it sounded better on paper than its transition into real life. The bagel was okay, good flavor but there was something just amiss.

    "text": "Sunday morning, downtown Phoenix is a ghost town, but this place is slammin'! Full of out of towners here for the ball game, and locals as well. The wait was longer than listed, but we quickly got seats at the bar. Servers really hustle here, but don't skimp on service.  We had the BC French Toast and Turkey Benedict, along with a super smooth nitro brewed coffee. The French toast cake topped with berries, flavored butter, granola, candied nuts (awesome!), and a touch of their house-made syrup. Usually these concoctions are overwhelmingly sweet and rich, but this one was just the right amount of sweet stuff. Added a side of bacon that was perfectly cooked.  The turkey Benedict came with smoke portions of potatoes and peppers, and the sauce had the right touch of citrus. Delicious!  Great spot for your pre-game breakfast!",

The whole hog is full of meat for 12.50 to 14$ depending on if you add green chili.  (I don't recommend the \"monster\" choice.  Seems to lack in experience for the extra price.  But the omelet itself is great.  The country bowl also is all meat.  Blue corn pancakes are so good but not worth 10$.   Coffee is great.  Monte cristo is great 11-13$   This is our favorite breakfast joint.",

Located on the 2nd floor of the city scape so it's easy to find, just next door to the tilted kilt. Use the parking garage and remember to have them validate your ticket!   I really enjoy the many southwest style options they have and it's really yummy! They also have a great selection of coffee, including some cold brews on tap! The only con is that on weekends depending on when you arrive it can be a fairly decent wait, so you might want to plan on some extra time until a table becomes available.",

    "text": "I'd like to start by saying it pains me to give this place 3 stars      The scoring is based on the following: Food Service  Location   Let's go through each one together   Food: The food was top notch. They have a great variety of breakfast items and all plates are served with a funky flare and twist on traditional breakfast items. Be prepared to expand your mind as you order fan favorite breakfast food. This place works hard to take your traditional breakfast and liven it up.  Service: The service had the greatest impact on my overall score although I'm pleased with how their leadership team handled it. Our waitress was a bit absent minded and not attentive. Orders were not fulfilled and when asked for items ordered she simply stated she forgot with no level of empathy or care. Upon speaking with the manager she quickly rectified the situation. Providing the items missing from the order and even comping the full meal. I always respect a strong leader so a special thank you to Cassie for going above and beyond to make our Fathers day special   Location:  They are located in the hub of downtown. Prepare for a rush and crowd as this place is busy and stays busy. In speaking with the staff the best time to come to beat the rush is during the week between 9-10am. Since they are located downtown be sure to find a parking structure and don't forget to bring your ticket for validation. They have an amazing patio area that allows you to take in a 360 view  This was my first time here and I know if I return and with better service they would easily obtain  stars",

That included the coffee (which comes out quickly in a large mug). But everything else about Breakfast Club is top-notch, from the food to the decor and especially the service. I ordered an item I'd not had elsewhere, a turkey benedict. The English muffin was a bit dry and tough to cut, but it was otherwise delicious. The breakfast items my dining companions chose looked equally tempting and also received very favorable feedback. I think among your breakfast options in the immediate area, you get the most interesting options here too.",

The place was easy to find thanks to the yelp tips about it being in the Palomar Hotel (required taking elevator up or the escalators) next to the Blue Hound.  We were able to walk right in and get seated promptly and the place was busy at about 9ish on a Sunday day morning.  Our server greeted us quickly and took our drink orders.  We all got water, coffee and mini me got the BC iced coffee.  When the drinks came out, we all enjoyed our coffees. They are very quick to refill our drinks.  We placed our orders which was not too long of a wait.  Hubby got the waffle and a Caesar salad, I got the BC Signature French Toast with a side of scrambled eggs, mini me got pancakes nana fosters style and her boyfriend got a breakfast sandwich.   We all ate our food and it was ok.  I enjoyed my French toast but I would not come back for it. Mini me liked her pancakes but wow the portion was huge she barely put a dent in it before she got full.  Hubby says his good was alright but nothing to rave about. I am glad I got to come and enjoy the view and I did notice it was pretty loud inside.  Service and staff were awesome!  They very attentive and so welcoming.",

I ordered a strawberry smoothie and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese over easy. The smoothie made it out pretty quick. It tasted good. The only thing that was kind of disappointing was there looked to be strawberry syrup at the bottom. I usually try and stay away from the syrup drinks but I guess one every now and then isn't the end of the world. When I see smoothie I think a bunch of fruit/juice in a blender. This might have been more of a shake.  The sandwich was really good. It was goldielocks bacon; not floppy but not crispy, just right. The over easy egg was also done well. The yolk ran but not enough to make a mess.  $19 seems a little pricey for breakfast but I guess that's about right for a sandwich and smoothie in the downtown part of a major metro area.",

Got a large OJ and it was huge but we shared. Had the salmon Benedicts which came out quickly but had a good amount of hollandaise sauce, more than my usual liking. The salmon was smoked and good and the muffin was perfectly toasted. The side of potatoes were roasted to perfection and the fruit on the side was great too.  Good speedy service with a smile was also a plus.",

To make that not so miserable you can check in online prior to arriving. We were actually late for the time we were quoted an available table and we were actually still sat with priority. The restaurant is open concept which makes everything feel nice and bright. There is a ton of outside seating which is dog friendly. The menu offered options ranging from \"I'm feeling healthy AF today\" to \"cheat day vibes\". I went with the biscuits and gravy. It was surprisingly good with a little spice to it. It was served with eggs, potatoes and a really fresh fruit salad. It was a huge amount of food that filled me up. I also ordered some pancakes because I was feeling ambitious. Flavor was nice and buttery and the edges were crunchy which I always love. I cannot comment on the parking situation however it's downtown so it's probably not the best. There is however public transportation options available, the light rail stop is very nearby.",

Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit.

We advised Sara, our waitress of this and wow did we get the crappiest attitude ever! She already had a crappy attitude and showed it can get even worse. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, NOT!!

It also was kind of cool that when I was there, a celebrity was present. There was this calm about everyone there that you do not normally find. Usually the staff ignores other customers due to the over service of said celebrity. Also, the people that eat here have tact...it was a decent time... and of course if you have good company to chat with over a delicious breakfast it cannot get much better, can it? :)",

While the outdoor area was nice and quiet and the staff was really friendly on a nice Sunday morning, the food was below par.   We ordered the lox bagel - which was fine, because they made none of it in-house - and the vegetable omelette. The egg white vegetable omelette was something you would expect from a college dining hall - made from egg beaters. Such a disappointment.   Perhaps the other offerings are much better, but my first and last impression of BC is of cheap egg beaters.",

Nice table that was half inside and half outside. Great day to be outside. Don't think it would work to well in July though. Awesome food. I got the blueberry pancakes. They were as big as my face and so good. Couldn't stop eating them but couldn't finish them either. I also tried potatos O'Brian which I had never had before. Breakfast potatoes with grilled onions and peppers. That was really good as well. I really liked that they had homemade syrup and that they put it in a olive oil bottle with the spout. Great idea. Really nice restaurant too. Very clean. I will be back. Not only to try and conquer the pancakes but also to try other things on the menu some of which my fellow breakfasters got. There were some good looking plates on that table. Great breakfast place in downtown Phoenix. Can't wait to go back.",

It had a roasted red pepper sauce on top of the gravy that was sweet and spicy.

We both ordered The Bird Omelette, with no cheese and asked for a side of pico.  So our food comes out and there is no pico. Someone forgot to make it... ummm ok.  The replacement was pace picante salsa... which IMO is not salsa and should not be served at restaurants.  The omelette was just ok.  It literally was huge... like 4 egg and over cooked.  The eggs were rubery and the turkey was dry, I thought it was a cracker no joke.  After a few minutes our server brings out a side of pico which helped tremendously.  It was very fresh and nice flavor.  We get the check and I am ready to pay when I see that they charged me for the pico?!?! Umm... excuse me but I just ordered two omelettes with no cheese... I think that would have given me a pass on the charge for the pico.. which I think was $2 it was good but not that good.  I hate places that nickle and dime you to death... so unfortunately even though we can walk there from our condo we wont be back.   The two stars are for the atmosphere, the coffee and the potatoes.  Another disappointing downtown eatery :/",

Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly hostess up front and was able to be seated at that moment , there after service just went down hill . Our server came to grab our drink order and we let her know it was our first time and she really didn't seem to care very much to make any suggestions or small talk . With the small menu , it wasn't difficult choosing what to order . I started off with an orange juice and until I took the first sip i didn't notice it was fresh squeezed , it was amazing , I ordered the turkey club wrap with a side salad and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast grilled cheese sand which without the Fontaine . Food came out in an acceptable amount of time , but a different server brought out food out , from what i learned from being a server my self , if someone takes your food out , you check up on them right after to see if everything came out right , regardless what the food runner has to say, didn't see our server for another 10 - 15 mins or so , my boyfriends drink was empty , he wanted Tabasco and I needed mustard , took a few bites out of my wrap since I was waiting for the Tabasco and mustard and it was just as good without it but I just love mustard . Anyways our sever finally comes around and drops the check off , and I looked at my boyfriend who still had half his grilled cheese and me still having more than half a wrap , and I just couldn't believe it , i was no where close to being done with my food and we weren't even there for more than 30 mins , my boyfriend finished where I just asked for a Togo container . Price was just right , food was on point , but our server , just took two stars off this review for me .",

My issues here are mostly service-based. Once I ordered a screw driver and the waiter exclaimed \"Wow, it's a bit early...\" Um... do you even want a tip?? Also, it's one of those places where they often forget about you, especially toward the end of service, and then when they bring the bill they're all apologetic. But it always happens. Not the end of the world but almost always an issue.  Apart from that, I usually share the french toast and the breakfast grilled cheese with my husband. Both very good, but not unbelievably so. A solid choice for breakfast.",

I had tried Matt's Big Breakfast the day before and was glad this place was a bit closer to the Westin since I was walking. I think it's a solid choice for breakfast and has great service.  B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- If you're walking, you have to take the escalator to get to it -- Friendly and attentive staff -- Whole hog omelette was very tasty & the creme fraiche broke the heavy meat flavor -- Upgraded my toast and hashbrowns for biscuits and gravy -- Biscuits are jalapeno cheddar & they add a red drizzle to the gravy -- Get the biscuits and gravy! -- French toast was good but not mind blowing  I actually had a great breakfast before I left Phoenix. The service was great and I was so undecided that my server really helped me out. As soon as she mentioned the jalepeno cheddar biscuits, I was sold!  I ended upgrading my potatoes (which I don't like much anyways) and toast for the biscuits and gravy. It came out with my whole hog omelette and some fruit. The fruit cup was small but definitely had some fresh melons, etc. I'm not a big fruit eater. The omelette was very meaty but I definitely enjoyed the chorizo the most. I added a little ketchup and the creme fraiche really helped break the the meat taste.  The biscuits and gravy were very tasty and meaty. My only complaint was that they were warm and not hot. I think that was the only real downside to my experience here. Overall the food was warm not hot. And we all know there's nothign like some hot and fresh food.  I also tried a slice or two of the french toast since I couldn't get any at Matt's the day before. It was average french toast. Sweet and savory with decent syrup.   I definitely would recommend this location. It has a great feel and the menu has a lot to offer. I loved the southwest twist on the biscuits and gravy, definitely recommend!",

You have to go up an escalator or stairs to get there (or walk through the hotel and take an elevator).  It can be a bit hard to find.  We sat outside though, and enjoyed doing some people watching.  Both my friend and I had the breakfast grilled cheese sandwich.  Bread, eggs, cheese, and hash browns.  It was good, but the hash browns made it too dry tasting.  Ketchup might have helped (but I was too hungry to stop eating and ask for some).  Mayo might have worked too.  But yeah, it was an okay size and about what I expected for the price (around $7 I believe).  I also got the chipotle biscuits and gravy.  It was okay.  It was actually just one biscuit.  The gravy sauce was different, neither good nor bad, but I think I would prefer just some normal white gravy.  I think it was about $4 which was too much for just one biscuit.  Nothing really bad about this place, but nothing really great either.",

Today we arrived and and had to wait longer then expected to be seated. we then noticed that people that arrived after us were being sat before us. No problem mistakes happen. However, when we brought it to hostess attention we recieved attitude and no apology. Then we ordered drinks as we usually do. They got the drink orders wrong and again we were greeted with attitude.  I am huge on customer service and therefore will not be returning to BC.",

I'm guessing both.  As far as the food goes, the breakfast grilled cheese is practically gold on a sandwich! The benedicts are quite delicious as well although they nixed my favorite one from the menu (filet mignon topped with poached egg and blue crab meat)... The fresh squeezed juice is also amazing, especially the V-18 (try the bloody mary made with this).",

Perfect weather, sat outside in the courtyard seating area of the restaurant. It was fairly crowded so the service was a little slow. We had to ask for things a couple times. The mimosas were expensive and not that great but the food is. Having a leisurely breakfast Downtown is something most of us don't get to do because of week-day work schedules, so I definitely recommend spending some time there if you get the chance. I had the Belgian waffle with strawberries and a side of bacon and my guy had a huge southwestern burrito. They were both terrific!",

    "text": "My last experience at The Breakfast Club will be just that, my last.  Living downtown I try and support downtown business and frequent establishments within walking distance of my condo.  I've had a few positive experiences here and  more than a few negative experiences, but my girlfriend likes the place (or she used to anyway) so when she comes downtown for the weekend we make the trek here.    The food is average, somethings are well done (good Bennies), some you could get just as good or better almost anywhere.  I can name at least 5 breakfast places in Phoenix that I feel have better food at a more competitive price.  The drinks used to be what kept me coming back, as I felt this place had one of the best Bloody Mary's in town.  My last experience here was a total let down and I should have known something was up when our server asked if we wanted \"spicy\" or \"non-spicy\" when we ordered our drinks, a question that has never been asked once in the nearly 2 years I've been ordering drinks here.  My \"non-spicy\" tasted totally different than anything I've been served there, and not in a good way.  My girlfriend's \"spicy\" tasted like someone added a pound of horseradish to it.  The drinks are also way over priced, $10 for a large and $7 for a small, I have no problem paying premium price for a premium product, but these no longer fit in that category.    The staff is what solidified my decision to cross this off the list of places I frequent as I've only read about service this horrible and never actually experienced it myself until now.  I'll start off by saying the service at the Downtown Breakfast Club has always been hit or miss, with many more misses than hits.  Some of the waitstaff has been very good, most has been not so good.  I'm really not that hard to wait on....take my order, bring me my food, refill my water, check in once to see if everything is OK and you can expect a good tip.  To illustrate my last visit here's a timeline:  Checked in with hostess for party of 2, was told 20-30 minutes.  Waited almost an hour and watched a total lack of control or caring as people would just walk up and seat themselves at the outdoor seating and nothing would be said by the staff.  If the outdoor seating is a free for all like sitting at the bar just let me know and I'll seat myself.  Finally had a table, waited 10-15 minutes before our server came over.  Luckily we knew what we wanted so we ordered our drinks and food right away.  Bloody Mary's took about 15 minutes to get to us and food was another 20-25.  Once the food arrived we asked for ketchup, which I feel is a fairly simple request, and the server said she would be right back with it.  Apparently right back to her means 15 minutes and when she appeared with it and we total her to forget about it since we were already 80% done with our food she seemed a bit put off that we would have the audacity to ask for something and not bow at her feet when she got around to getting it to us.    Was the food good, would you like more water, can I get you anything else??  Don't ask our server because she wouldn't know, not once did anyone stop by our table and ask even one of these basic questions.   My advise to the owner of this establishment would be kill it with fire.  This location is destroying your brand and had I never been to the Scottsdale location I would never have given this one as many chances and I have.  I would rather eat stale Fruity Pebbles with month old milk then eat here again.",

I ordered the $10 whole wheat pancakes which were pretty good, very wheaty w real maple syrup, but nothing to rave about. Good luck trying to find anything VEGAN on the menu except toast and fruit.  The girl at the table next to me ordered a massive burrito which looked like someone had barfed Mexican food on it- that's all I could think about. It was a creamy green color with corn in it and some red chunks. It didn't look appetizing at all, but she was moaning when she ate it, so I guess it was good. Different strokes!  Great place if you like to wear sweaters around your neck like they do in France kind of crowd. I probably won't go back unless someone else buys the ticket.",

Some of the orders were wrong, too, which I expected because sit-down restaurants are never great at to-go.

Additionally, my coffee cup was horribly dirty and stained on the inside which I didn't notice until I had drank half the cup. It was overall a very unpleasant and disappointing meal.",

Thankfully after reading other Yelp reviews we found the Breakfast Club is located in the center of the complex on the 2nd floor. The first sign showing us where to go was in the parking garage elevator.  The patio was very comforting and casual. I ordered The Bird omelette. A massive amount of turkey and avocado. I don't each this much turkey on Thanksgiving. It was just too much. The side of fruit was very welcomed and the potatoes were just right.   My coworkers enjoyed their french toast and eggs benny, but both had over half their entrees left on their plate. Such a waste in food with huge portions.",

    "text": "Good food but terrible service.  We came here because there's really nothing much going on in Phoenix on Sundays as far as food scene goes. It was 5 of us and most of our food was good. Non-alcoholic choices was very limited.  The hostess told us we can go get coffee etc. in that little take-out booth they have while we were waiting for a table. I went there trying to get water. There were 3 servers 3-5 feet away from me at the counter, nobody saw me for at least 1 minute. They were busy prepping drinks etc. Fine. Then I said \"excuse me\", nobody heard me. At some point one of the server was facing my direction but apparently her vision was focusing on this drink that she did not acknowledged me at all. After waiting for another minute, I yelled \"hello\" still nobody heard me. Either they need to hire more people to attend to the guest at the take out booth or they need servers with better hearing.  The coffee mug were stained with coffee marks, not sure if it was an old mug. Then when the server refilled out coffee, it spilled to the table. She said she will come back with a towel. Never came back. Wait to order food and the food to come is also longer than average.   Usually a restaurant who has a 4-star review is pretty solid. I wonder if I am spoiled with a higher restaurant service and food standard in New York. But I definitely will not recommend this place.",

Nice plaza plus seating inside. The furniture outside was pretty beat up tho.   Upscale breakfast with darkly dressed hostesses and servers. My server greeted me right away but sadly spent much of her time with the bigger tables.   I ordered a large juice and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese. It came with hash browns, two eggs, and bacon on a grilled cheese.   The sandwich was disappointing. It was boring. One slice of cheese, way too much under cooked hash browns and no seasoning. No fruit on the side. No garnish. Nothing. Just $7.50 for a boring sandwich and $7 for a glass of juice.   They are charging their customers for their location. Just because they dress everyone in black does not make it high end. I will be recommending my friends NOT to bother with this over priced, over valued, over dressed stop.",

They should double if not triple their staff. Poor management is all I can say. I have ordered the BC Dip. It is 1:20 right now. I will update the review when it comes out. We are at 1:45 now and still no food. This should have been an easy 10 minute dish. Not very busy now. Service and attention still not at par. Reducing from 3 to 2 stars for lack of effort.

I get it, it's a nice place Downtown and it gets packed during lunch but having customers who have 1h lunch wait for over 35 minutes to get their food isn't right.  Also, today, two of my coworkers waited for over 40 minutes and when their food arrived it was the wrong order. Ditto they brought the right plate like 15 minutes later and they didn't charge for their food but it seems to be it'd be easier to have 2-3 more employees to help during peak hours.  Their food's really good. I usually have the turkey wrap and it's delicious and the Caesar salad portion's huge to be a side salad. Too bad they don't have pasta salad anymore because it was delicious.  So all in all it's a nice place to go for lunch if you're not in a hurry. It only gets 3 starts because of the long time they take to cook/bring food but their food itself's actually really good.  Give it a try! Just make sure you go there with plenty of time.",

We sat at the counter which was nice and spacious and even had a TV for every 3 or 4 seats (nothing like watching some wrestling and rhythmic gymnastics at breakfast...).  Our server/ barista-tender was a bit curt at first, but was very pleasent by the time our food came. My husband had the \"Nutty\" waffle w/ candied almonds and walnuts. He thought the bottle they give you syrup in was \"really smart\". He also enjoyed the food. I had the \"Lean and green\" omelet (spinach, broccoli, onions, peppers, and I opted to add turkey sausage). Even with adding the sausage, there was not enough filling in the omelet. Partially, I think, because it was super fluffy. It was also super delicious, lack of veggies aside. It also came w/ a small mountain of fresh fruit and potatoes O'Brien. Their \"potatoes O'Brien\" are not potatoes O'Brien. I had a large amount of largely cubed, undercooked, potatoes w/ no seasoning and one or two bits of onion and pepper. Worst potatoes Ive had in a while.  Our overall experience was good, but seriously, opt for something other than potatoes as a breakfast side.",

My husband and I got married on a Friday evening next door at Hotel Palomar and wanted to find a place for family and friends to have breakfast together the next morning. While the Breakfast Club doesn't typically take reservations, they did promise to accommodate our large group to the best of their ability. That Saturday, our 'large group' increased by at least 10 and the staff didn't skip a beat, finding a way for all of us to at least be in proximity to each other. It worked out so well, the food and service were amazing, and we wanted to thank you for making our wedding breakfast a wonderful part of weekend!!!",

    "text": "I arrived at this place a little before 2:00 yesterday, was seated and handed a menu. I sat there waiting for any one of the3 servers buzzing around this nearly empty restaurant to take my order. As I sat there for 5 minutes with no one paying attention to me, I watched as a woman and her son entered the restaurant, sat down and were promptly told that they had to leave because \"we stop serving at 2:00.\" So they leave. Meanwhile, still no one came to take my order. Hangry, I abandoned my table to sit at the bar thinking I would be able to get my blood sugar up before I passed out in my stool. Still no one approached me! I noticed one of the female servers whisper to a thin young man at the breakfast counter and point to me so I thought yay! I'm not going to ignored any longer. Nope! That kid refused to look at me, walked away and still no one came to take my order. Instead, they were all cleaning up and trying to see who could the first one to clock out. I then get up, walk over to a female server and ask if she would take my order to which she replied,  \"no sorry. We close at 2:00.\" Now really upset, I point to my menu still lying on the table inside and say \"but I've already been seated and handed a menu.\" She then has the nerve to say \"I don't know. I'm gonna have to ask.\" She then goes and asks an older female manager who then says yeah sure we will serve you. Then the manager and all of the female staff crowd around a computer in the kitchen just sitting there staring at me. Oh and by the way, when I went to the restaurant down the street to give them my money my phone indicated it was only 2:05. I was treated like shit erroneously and that other couple was asked to leave before 2 o'clock. You ladies either need to get another job or change your attitude. Thanks!",

There was a wait so I did call ahead seating; which the hostess told me would be fine as long as I got there within the hour. I got there earlier and my table was already given away and she told me it would be a 20 minute wait. We decided to wait but saw there were two seats at the bar so opted for that option. They don't do bottomless mimosas here for lunch but bottomless is not needed with these mimosas. I ordered the large and it was about a 4:1 ratio of champagne to orange juice; which is perfect in my opinion. I ordered the French toast which was a huge portion and topped off with fresh fruit and pecans. It was delicious and more than enough. It's located in the second floor of the building which is located in downtown Phoenix a block away from the stadium.",

Our waiter John was super friendly and helped me choose between a few options I was interested in.  I settled on the Huevos Rancheros and an Iced Coffee.  Both were tasty. The Huevos Rancheros was huge I couldn't eat all of it. I did enjoy them but have had better.  The Iced coffee was good but how can you mess that up. Seems like this is a busy place, we got there just at the right time as there was a wait soon after we sat down.  I loved the outdoor seating option but since it was steamy we stayed inside.",

I've been here before about 3-4 years ago but it was just as good then as it was yesterday.  It's a very laid back type of place with indoor/outdoor seating. I chose indoors because I didn't want to get hot and sweaty. You seat yourself so my friend and I chose a booth seat.  Service was fast! We ordered drinks ($7 mimosas for their breakfast cocktails) and they came out fast! I ordered The Bird omelette which came with potatoes and fruit. I was expecting the potatoes to need a ton of salt and the fruit to be bland. That was not the case. The potatoes had such a delicious flavor and the fruit was freshly cut. The omelette was better than I expected. Most omelets barely have any of the fixings, this omelet was packed with chunks of avocado and turkey and everything it came with.  Friendly staff, amazing food, and laid back scenery, the Breakfast Club is a great way to start the morning",

I had eggs Benedict and the waffle with bananas foster on it and a Bloody Mary, mimosa and a screw driver. Don't judge me.    It's was all perfect or close to perfect. I didn't feel like I was in some chain restaurant like lazy dog. This was classy. Service was great. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had. The Benedict was perfect. I have eaten hundreds of benedicts in hundreds of restaurants and this was surely top 5. Indoor seating and outdoor patio. Clean. The women all wear yoga pants too so that's nice. The mimosa and screwdriver had fresh orange juice. If this place was in the Bay Area I would live here. One of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots of all time.",

The Eggs Benedict was ok, 3/5 due to the fact that the sauce wasn't spectacular and the Eggs Benedict was slightly overlooked. I like my Eggs Benedict slightly runny and these were firm (even though I ordered runny).   No big deal. A good meal, slightly higher priced, good location, good service, and a nice relaxing atmosphere.  I would recommend this eatery!   Overall, 4/5.",

    "text": "I would possibly give this one a 2.5 stars if it were possible but the two stars is not wholly inaccurate. As others have stated, portions are huge and the food is generally quite tasty. What is lacking is service. On my visit I ordered coffee and was at first very happy when I received the huge pitcher of cream instead of one of those cute but unreasonably small things that holds two tablespoons but that is where my delight ended. Upon finishing my cup,before food arrived, I was completely done with my meal before being asked if I would like a refill. And there were plenty of opportunities, as one member of my party had been given an incorrect order that needed to be replaced, so there were at least six people/stops at the table where they could clearly observe an empty cup. Empty water cups also went unfilled until we flagged someone down.  That incorrect order was also a fail. My sister doesn't eat meat so she requested the breakfast burrito, sans chorizo. Instead she was served one with chorizo and the extra chorizo queso on the side. It took just over 20 minutes to get a replacement breakfast burrito, which at this point is basically scrambled eggs and mushrooms. When the check came, we were charged an extra amount for the chorizo queso, which we had to request be removed from the bill as we pointed out it was never requested in the first place.  No one ever came to ask if the food that was delivered properly was satisfactory and one of my dining companions got up and grabbed a condiment carrier for our table as it was clear that unless we got one on our own it wasn't going to happen.  Overall the food is good when you actually get what you order, but when I choose to go out to eat, especially for breakfast, it is about service as much as food. If I wanted to serve myself and not have anyone be concerned about my experience I would still be in a bad marriage. It is so disappointing because this area of the city is bereft of morning options, but sadly bad service doesn't change things.",

    "text": "Breakfast Club (BC) is something of a mystery to me.  What's the story behind it?  Whose inspiration brought this place to life?  Who are the minds behind the look, the feel, and the menu of this place?  I guess I'm one of those people that enjoys the romance of little things like that going into a dining experience.  Florida based RDG Development is the owner of this breakfast nook (with locations both in Downtown Phoenix and Old Town Scottsdale), but the trail abruptly ends there.  So I guess Breakfast Club just sprung out of thin air?  No matter.  Empty fridge on a Saturday morning and hungry, Breakfast Club's Downtown location is less than a mile walk for me.  Arriving at 7am opening, it was time to eat.  Oh, and yes Breakfast Club's Downtown location can indeed be a challenge to find.  So I'll make it as simple as possible.  Go to the second floor outdoor walkway of the Cityscape block east of Central, south of Washington, West of 1st St, and north of Jefferson.  Along the outdoor walkway in the middle, you'll find Breakfast Club nestled between Blue Hound Kitchen and Green Iron Cleaners.  You can park in one of the underground parking lots at Cityscape and the hostess at the restaurant will validate your parking.  Got it?  Alright, now to the dining experience.  I grabbed a spot at the bar area for my first breakfast outing.  The restaurant can seat more than 100 at capacity including more than a dozen at the front bar.  The menu at BC is fairly traditional but with a decent amount of variety.  You've got your meat and egg plates, your yogurt and cereal bowls, omelets, waffles, french toast, benedicts, pretty much exactly what you'd expect at a breakfast spot.  BC helpfully marks their specialty items with the BC namesake in case you're looking for items that stand out, so that's my M.O. for my first outing here.  I actually went with two items for my first visit.  First off, the BC Granola bowl.  Oats, dates, golden raisins, apricots, flax seed, dried cranberries, apple, and chia seeds served with your milk of choice (I went with almond milk).  For my second dish, the BC Signature French Toast.  Cinnamon Challah french toast topped with almonds, walnuts, and a variety of berries.  And of course a small glass of OJ to wash it all down.  First off, the granola.  I've had some great granola mixes at other breakfast spots (Pomegranate Cafe's especially stands out), but this one was a disappointment for me.  While undeniably healthy, the chia and flax seeds overwhelmed the other flavors going on in this dish.  I didn't pick up hardly any of the sweet or fruity components I was hoping for.  The texture was fine and the almond milk was an adequate accompaniment, but the granola itself just wasn't a very pleasant experience for my palate.  The french toast on the other hand was largely a thumbs up.  Great big portion with a generous helping of the fruit and nuts.  Toast was perfectly cooked and a good mix of the sweet and savory components.  Total cost for the food, OJ, tax, and tip came to $29.  The granola was a disappointment as I mentioned earlier, but french toast was solid.  As I write this, BC currently gets a 3.5 star Yelp rating.  I think that's pretty much dead on.  The friendly and attentive service I got from the wait staff (and my waitress in particular), combined with the large portions of food was enough to push this just enough into 4 star range.  The place was packed by Saturday at 8am so clearly BC has its fans.  I'd still love to know who the brainchild (or brainchildren) of this operation are and what direction its going in the future.  But for now, I'd say Cityscape has itself a reputable breakfast stop.  As long as that's the case, I suppose that's all that matters.",

I asked what the wait was for one and was quickly seated at the bar.  Their menu has all the American classics pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, and benes. I ordered a soy latte, the coffee infused waffles and the smoked salmon lox bene. The latte wasn't bad but nothing special, I kinda wished I had ordered a regular coffee after trying it. The waffle was interesting but sub-par in the end. It had a bitter coffee flavor, it wasn't over powering, nice and subtle. I think the generous helping of super sweet caramel sauce on top killed what could potentially be an amazing waffle. Maybe order the sauce on the side to control the sweetness and soggyness of your waffle. Next the bene, again I wasn't totally impressed with this dish either. The muffin seemed average and one of my eggs was way over cooked. The hollandaise was perfectly prepared though not overly exciting in flavors.  All in all a \"meh\" eating experience. My waitress did an okay job and my food came out in a timely matter.   What with other great places to grab breakfast in the downtown Phoenix area I don't think I'll be back.  P.s when preparing drinks with orange slices make sure your wait staff are wearing gloves/ using tongs. I caught a staffer (not my waitress) digging her whole ungloved hand in the orange container.",

The place isn't large on the inside so it does feel a bit cramped.  There are lots of outdoor seating but isn't popular during winter so everyone want to be inside. Service is great! My coffee cup was never empty. Smiley welcoming faces.   Food is good, I had the border bowl, which was amazing! Prices are fair for the location. Would probably be back when back in town. Food 4/5 Price 3/5 Service 5/5 Place 4/5",

Food took forever to come out. Once I got my breakfast sandwich, the eggs on it were just about room temperature. This is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to food! I'm not at Mcdonlald's ordering a 99 cent breakfast sandwich. This is a 7 dollar sandwich and they had the audacity to serve it with cold eggs. I could tell something was amiss because our server did not bring our food to the table, the workers who did were in a tizzy...Is there poor management here? Not sure whats going on...I got my order back out within a couple minutes, and it was fresh, piping hot and quite good I must say.   As we waited for the bill, someone at our table gave our server an empty iced tea for a refill, it never made it back to the table, even after she brought us our bills. Before I left I went walking around to see if I could find our server to get my friends iced tea, I could see her talking with the other servers behind glass just yuking it up laughing, having a good ole' time. Did not get the tea. Wanted to like this place, probably won't return...",

Whoever thinks they're going to be seated right away for brunch on a Sunday is delusional. Tracking progress on the app was super helpful so we could walk around and be back in time to be seated. The caramel latte was on point. Seriously so good. And it kept my hands warm since it was so chilly. The outdoor heaters helped a lot too. We ordered a couple of rounds of mimosas too. I had the bird omelette which was so good I ate it before I could take a picture of it. And my friend got the border bowl which was perfect. Our server was so nice but I felt bad because you could visibly see the stress on all of the staff because of how busy it was. I did get the the ketchup and hot sauce I requested but it didn't matter. The food was great without it. I will definitely be brunching here again.",

The grilled cheese sandwich was excellent, with folded scrambled eggs, crispy shredded hash browns, and melts cheese (I opted for the bacon on the side; the bacon was delicious and perfectly cooked). The biscuits and gravy was delicious with the jalapeno cheese biscuits.  The pancake was super tasty and fluffy.  The Blood Mary was tangy with a lemon pepper overtone.  The service was very friendly and attentive. Check this place out!",

    "text": "Breakfast Club! Breakfast Club! Not just the name of a great 1980s classic, but also the perfect name for a restaurant because it tells me everything I need to know: they serve breakfast, and they're probably going to do it well.   The BC is located in downtown Phoenix's CityScape development, and is super convenient to the Hotel Palomar and the Gold's Gym. They have two store points: one is the main cafe itself, where you have a full-service sit-down restaurant and bar. The other point is a free-standing coffee shop-style location (located right outside), which serves all of their coffee and juice drinks, plus a limited to-go menu of their food items. I happily visited both the cafe and the restaurant a total of two times each during a week-long stay in downtown PHX, so that speaks volumes as to their appeal.  Here are some other basics: there's ample seating indoors and out, and as a solo diner, I appreciated the semi-circle and inviting bar seating area, plus the super-quick service. I love creative lattes and good drip coffee, so I was happy to see that they offer some nice flavors and syrups for their lattes, even more diverse than, say, Starbucks. The drip coffee is also tasty, and they offer both soy and almond milk if you're opposed to cow.  As for the food selection, you have your sundry items from any cafe, from sandwiches to paninis to salads to soups. Everything looked really fresh and appealing, but I was more game for a Southwestern-style breakfast item. I was so torn between the Huevos con Masa and the Huevos Rancheros, but I decided to go with the Rancheros. What was \"right\" about this dish was the preparation of the eggs, the black beans, and the pork green chili, but what could have improved would be to get rid of the flour/chipotle-flavored tortilla in favor for a more authentic corn tortilla option. All in all, it was only $10, plus their hot sauce wasn't limited to boring old red Tabasco (they also had Cholula), so that's a bonus.  The service was great and the menu selections were plentiful enough to please any breakfast/lunch palate. I will definitely be back next time I'm downtown!",

    "text": "Hubby & I stopped here on our way out of town on Jan 2nd. We ate at the Arrogant Butcher a couple of weeks prior and decided to stop back at City Scape to try the Breakfast Club after reading a lot of good reviews.  We were seated quickly...always a plus. Drink order taken within a few minutes. Ordered our food after our drinks arrived ... total time seated... maybe 10 min. Not too shabby huh?? Our food arrived not too long after that.  I ordered the BC Signature French Toast, which is totally out of the norm for me but something about fruit that morning sounds delish. Now, fruit usually turns me off at restaurants because it turns out to be just ok and slightly mushy. My plate of yummy goodness was huge!! 3 large pieces of toast with tons of nuts and fruit and just the right amount of powdered sugar. I'm also not a big butter fan but the butter they provided was good. I'm also not a huge syrup fan but it had great flavor. (I know, why did I order french toast again? LOL) Man, I'm so glad I ordered this. The fruit was perfect. I could not finish everything and it kind of made me sad because it was just THAT good. I shared with hubby because that's what good wifey's do, right?  Hubby had the Huevos Rancheros and practically inhaled it. Need I say more?  Service was great. Hubby's coffee was refilled a few times. It was only was empty once when a big rush of people came in. No biggie.  We definitely will be back. We plan on taking our teens with us next time. And yes, I plan on ordering the french toast again. :)",

I ordered the eggs Benedict which was pretty good, mostly because the sauce was pretty tasty. Potatoes were cooked well but lacked flavor and didn't finish them. My fiance ordered the biscuits and gravy and literally almost threw up from eating them. He said the sauce was weird and pointed out to me how it was greasy and literally separating in front of us. He commented that it look and tasted like it had been sitting in the back for awhile. Now let me just say, that this is the first time he has had this reaction to something he has eaten. It's not normal for him to complain about the food and I even had to convince him to bring it up to the waitress. He took one bite and that was it. There's no way it was fair for him to pay for it! Service was great though! We had a girl that was training and she did wonderfully, I wish I could have gotten her name. (Her highlight was on point tho! :) We informed her about the gravy, she apologized immensely and we got it taken off our bill. Probably won't be coming back here again for the food but would prob pop in for that dirty chai latte. 1 star for dirty chai latte 1 star for wonderful waitress 1 star for hollandaise sauce",

My friend loved his first mimosa served large in a pint glass.  Perfect for a big man!  For breakfast I ordered the Huevos Con Masa.  The first bite of the cornbread blew me away.  Soft, chewy and so flavorful.  Start adding the flavors of the queso and fried eggs and you have one amazing treat!  The guys raved about the border bowl and the quick start loaded.

    "text": "I'm not really sure why this place only gets 3.5 stars. We have been twice now trying entirely different things, and everything has been superb. I will say the prices are a bit steep for breakfast food, but it is always spot on.  The kids have had the French toast both times (an instant favorite, well cooked, thick slices). They've also enjoyed the bacon and eggs and fruit, and the overpriced $4 8oz cup of fresh squeezed apple juice. Legit juice, though.   We've tried the traditional bene, the Huevos con masa, the lean and green and the quick start with a cub of granola. All over the board with that list. All good choices.   I remember really loving the bene the first time we went. Super filling, perfectly cooked, generous sauce - indulgent, yet not heavy and worth it. I remember liking the consistency and texture of the English muffins as well. The potatoes O'brien were crisp outside and soft inside (like all potatoes should be.).   The lean and green was just that, light and perfect for people that don't eat big breakfasts. Could have done without the broccoli.   The Huevos con masa was unique and if you like Mexican for breakfast, it's a good way to go. Not sure we've ever had anything like it. Rich spicy flavor with a pleasant hint of sweet in the masa that didn't ruin the dish. Pico was fresh and paired well with the potatoes o'brien.   The quick start was a traditional egg, bacon, toast and fruit dish. The eggs were exactly as ordered, over medium - just enough runny yolk to eat with half the 9 grain toast. The 9-grain was thick sliced and medium density paring perfectly with their awesome homemade jam (which was more like mashed berries with a little sweet - I wish they would bottle and sell that stuff because I would be all over that!). I always enjoy stealing everyone's fruit skewers, since no one likes melons except me. You get a quarter slice each of cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, and watermelon. This time I paired my QuickStart with a cup of BC granola, which was loaded with rolled oats, dates, golden raisins, apricots, flax seed, dried cranberries apple & chia seeds. Wished I had room for more, or could buy some for home. I loved that it held up its texture phenomenally in milk without getting soggy. I thought it was less in your face sweet than store bought granola and enjoyed the variety of detailed ingredients in it. So yum!  I bet it's awesome in their yogurt.",

An ice tea for my husband, 2 lemonades, and a coffee with cream for myself. Clarification again with the waitress yes, I would like cream with my coffee. She returns with an ice tea in plastic container with a lid for my 30 year old husband and 2 very tall GLASS glasses of lemonade of the 2 and 1 year old children. I then ask, \"can we please have something with a lid\". She replies with a little attitude and \"ok but can I take ur food order first\" as the kids squirm and whine for the delicious lemonade that sits before them. Finally we get the plastic ware after she takes our food order, checks on the table next to us and runs food from the kitchen for another table.   THEN when the food begins to arrive it comes out one plate at a time. 5 minutes apart. But of course forgetting the kids plate. The kids get to share one side of eggs as I regretfully ordered a spicey dish with jalepenos. Had to ask 3 different people for a side plate so my youngest didn't have to eat off the table.   Finally the waitress mumbles she didn't hear we wanted a quick breakfast with the eggs scrambled and piece by piece assembled the breakfast. Eggs, later some fruit, followed by 5 minutes later some bacon, and finally when we were finished with our meal out came the toast.   Never once did our waitress refill our water or coffee (that I had to ask 3x for creamer) and as we signed our card receipt she never once took a plate of food.  Absolutely horrible service!",

    "text": "Thoroughly disappointed. My friend took me here as a belated bday brunch. The waitress got my order wrong, even though we had a lengthy discussion about it.  My food was lukewarm, as was my hot cocoa. They never brought us water.  Our waitress didn't ask us ONCE how everything was, but was quick to want to take away plates that we weren't even finished with. The worst part is it wasn't even busy! They didn't get ONE thing right, nor were they particularly friendly. I'll pass and stick with the Scottsdale location.",

We were greeted by the hostess when you first walk in you see the traditional diner seating but also the chair table and booths. We sat at a table our waitress was very nice we both had the French toast. I was not expecting it to be so much food but glad it was. They gave you these huge French toast on a platter there's about 4 of them. The atmosphere was warm everything about this place is great definitely will come back whenever I'm in the city.",

    "text": "My husband and I frequent this breakfast spot and we absolutely love it. Their food is delicious and has been every time we have been there. The only thing that seems to change from visit to visit is the service and the coffee. Some days the service and coffee are great and other days it is not. Honestly though, the food definitely makes up for it. Also, we have not tried their espresso coffees, only the drip coffees. So far we are stuck on two dishes because they are amazing: the biscuits and gravy and the border bowl. We highly recommend both of them, everything on the menu looks great though. The service has mostly been good. We are always seated right away and the staff are always friendly. Usually your water and coffee stays pretty full because everyone seems to help out with replenishing most days. This is a great spot for breakfast or brunch! They have indoor or outdoor seating and the atmosphere is very relaxing and nice. It is a little expensive, but that is the norm for everywhere downtown.",

We put ourselves on a wait list prior to going there. When we got there we checked in and waited about 10-minutes The place was busy, but wait the service was quick the food excellent the staff was awesome. We were a party of 6 and we all tried something different I had a breakfast burrito with the green chili pork on top and asked for salsa poured it on top and it was phenomenal. We had oat meal that was a bit strange looking because it had bell pepper slices in it but it to was amazing. We had another dish of chicken fried chicken also amazing and huevos  con masa also amazing! My flavor pallet was well satisfied. Before leaving I stop at there coffee kiosk and got a black iced tea to go even the tea was the freshest and most amazing Great portion reasonable priced it's a must eat if your ever in the area.",

    "text": "Not often 5 stars are given to a place like this. \"Matts Bug Breakfast\" now has competition. Good news for both... both places are on opposite sides of the main city area. Prices are between $-$$. I'm limited to what and how I can eat... therefore I had a few substitutions... they made it work at no extra charge. If one sticks with H2O you can be out the door on $11 including tip. For me must have coffee. Anyway, sat at counter greeted with smile by everyone. Seeing what was ordered and what came out of kitchen... EXCELLENT! Decent if not big portions for what's paid. Best part of all... food is very good. Being a diner junkie... I'm looking forward to coming back on a day of splurging. I would recommend the one of the specialty plates, Biscuits and gray, chicken fried chicken and  eggs, one of the eggs Benedict... I believe the place gets 3.5 stars as an average ... I call BS. 4+. The Breakfast Club will come off as trendy... look past it... and order. All types... here. Food is great!",

    "text": "This place rocks it.  The Breakfast Club was located conveniently next to my hotel, so we took advantage of their yummy eats daily. The menu offers creative + traditional breakfast/bruch choices plus fresh squeezed juices.   Day one I tried the Bird omlette which was turkey, avocado and herb cheese. The omlette was very fluffy and light and the turkey delicious. I didn't care for the cheese which was more like a sauce - it was way garlicky and overpowered everything else. My boss has the Lean + Mean which was egg whites + veggies - he said it was great.  Day two - the Turkey Benedict. Oh hell yes - possibly one of the greatest breakfasts I've had, ever. The poached eggs were done perfectly and again, their turkey is great. I love that you can sub extra fruit or toast for the potatoes everything comes with.  If you're in the area, this is a great way to start the day off right!",

    "text": "This was my go to place for breakfast while working in downtown Phoenix for the week. I got the quick start with a slight modification, a slice of french toast instead of regular toast. I've eaten it three days in a row...why you might ask? Can't I venture out? Try something new? Normally yes, but when you've got something good going, why change it?   The food is great. When I wake up at 4am all I can think about is that bacon and the french toast with real maple syrup. I actually wait until 620 to start walking over from my hotel. The bacon- I don't know what they do to it but its like a freshly fried pig and yes it tastes great. The one slice of french toast isn't too sweet, too soggy or too similar to a plain slice of bread (you've had those bland french toasts before). Its perfect---its just the right amount of sweet, with spice and doesn't leave you stuffed.   The biggest plus---the place is dirt cheap for the quality.",
