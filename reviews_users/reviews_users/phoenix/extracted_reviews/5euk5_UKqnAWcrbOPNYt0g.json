However, he did not use pen and paper to write down our order.   The chicken coconut soup was savory, with the right amount of seasonings and spices. It was enough for at least 3 people.   My wife ordered the yellow curry with beef. Since the waiter did not write it down, he gave us yellow curry with chicken instead. This dish was OK; nothing outstanding about it.   We ordered sticky rice and mango for dessert. This dish was good. The right amount of sweetness coupled with some tartness from the fruity mango.  If we are in that neighborhood, we may stop by again.",

The drunken noodles were bland, chicken was poor quality. The silver noodle stir fry had a mush-like texture. Chicken wing appetizer was ok but the sauce that came with it was no good. My husband wanted a Thai tea but they were out. This was shocking as he orders this at every single Thai restaurant and we have never been told they ran out.  The staff seemed very uninterested in their customers. We had to flag another worker down for a drink as our server was MIA most of the time. Water was never refilled. Nobody asked how our food was. Took forever to get our check.  Did we come on an off night or something?!? I seriously doubt we'll ever be back.",

We tried the drunken noodles with chicken, Penang curry with chicken (curry is more like a gravy - extra star for not being cheap about the curry. Curry should be thick!) and we got 2 Thai Teas. $26.92. Prices are about normal for Thai food. And their lunch specials seem to average $8. I give them an extra star for friendly service since the owner recognized me from his girlfriends mom's restaurant on Broadway in South Phoenix (same name). I don't visit too often, thus to remember me means the staff really does care about their customers. It's nice to be remembered :) and they serve coconut ice cream with pineapple chunks after the meal. Who doesn't love coconut ice cream?!  Stop and enjoy the food and appreciate a Thai Place who knows Curry is suppose to be like a gravy and not soup.",

I ordered pad Thai with shrimp and chicken here but none of the protein was fresh and as a matter of fact, the shrimp was so spoiled that I could taste the ammonia built up in the texture. The chicken was not really that fresh either but oh well it was edible at least. The pad Thai could use a bit more green onion for better flavor than just smothering it with pad Thai sauce. The ice cream was nice and refreshing. The curry according to my husband was a \"meh, generic curry and nothing really that special\" kind of dish and he gave it a 3 out of 5. The service was nice and the wait was mildly longer than expected but we arrived fairly late at night so that might be why. Overall our experience was just \"so so\", it's good to have Thai restaurant for dinning variation in your local area but it's not incredibly impressive when it comes to the food.",

This version is less sauce and it's perfectly seasoned. Some pas see views I had in the past were either too salty, or the meat was scarce. Probably the best I've had. They also had some banger korean ballads playing that remind me of my ex but luckily the food was there to comfort me from sadness. 10/10 would go again  #CERTIFIEDBANGER",

From Meagan B.'s thread: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016\">yelp.com/topic/phoenix-y...</a>  After being dismissed from jury duty, I wanted to celebrate having a half day free so I headed over to Chanpen to indulge in some tasty Thai food! They currently have a good selection of lunch specials for $7.95 that includes a small eggroll, soup, and wonton crisps. I decided on the red curry with tofu, Thai hot.   The interior is cute with sunny warm accents and unique decor. I might have indulged in a Thai iced tea had the server asked me if I wanted an additional drink after taking my order, but for my meal today I stuck with my tall Mason jar of water with lime wedges.   The soup was served first, piping hot. It was a clear, well seasoned broth with cabbage, celery, and cilantro. The rest of the meal came out fairly quickly, and had a nice presentation. The curry had a lot of fried tofu and vegetables. The curry itself was more like a regular hot to me, hot enough to sear the tongue a little but not enough to really make my nose run. The wonton crisps were light with good crunch, and the eggroll was pretty basic, served with a super sweet sauce.  Service was speedy and my check was presented to me when I was halfway done through my meal, so if you are in a rush for lunch this is a good choice to eat.   Overall it was a pleasant meal and I'd go back to try more items if I were in the area.",

    "text": "We were looking for a Thai restaurant to go to in Tempe so I pulled out Yelp and decided to try Chanpen. We meet our son and his friends so he got our table first.   The place seemed fairly large with lots of tables. Just a normal restaurant and fairly clean. I could tell the servers were of Thai descent. Very casual because we were missing table serving and they just handed to us at one end of the table and they had us hand it down the line. No problem with this at all. Gets the job done. Just a very casual type of place.   We started off with Fresh Rolls with Shrimp and Thai Egg Rolls. One thing was made very clear by my wife is when she took the first bite of the Fresh roll is that the outer skin of the roll was very fresh. Been to lots of places and it's been pre-made sitting in refrigerator. This was very fresh very good. Adding the dipping sauce and I'm in heaven. Really good we loved it. The egg roll were really good but again dipping in their dipping sauce was so good. We just loved their appetizers.   I got the Pad-Thai with Shrimp and Chicken. I didn't get it too spicy so it was on the sweet side. I think that if I got it spicier then the mixture of sweetness and spicy would have made it really good but then again I really like it. It's a pretty big portion and cooked just how I asked for it. I liked it a lot.   So my wife ordered a Thai coffee so sweet drink with a sweet meal is very sweet. Really good overall. To end our meal they gave us complementary Coconut ice cream. One nice scoop. It was really good. It had some pineapple inside too.   So we had a really good meal. Food was really good. Nice atmosphere. Good but not great service. I'm saying this cause they got one of our orders wrong and someone sit there for awhile without their meal. That's okay. It's a very casual environment. If you go expect good service but not great.   We will probably be back. We'll see. Enjoy",

After reading multiple rave reviews I was able to talk my wife into trying it out. We were not disappointed, what a gem of a spot! We ordered the Crab puffs, Pad Se Yew and Yellow curry with chicken which I added Pineapple to (sounds odd but it is LIFE changing), love when a restaurant has no problem adding or withholding something because it's made from scratch. Anyway...we were surprised by the size of the portions because they were HUGE and the prices were so reasonable, plus when we had eaten as much as we could possibly eat, they brought us boxes AND gave us ice cream, I mean come on!!!! Obviously I've found my happy food place.   Also just to note a few people have complained about the service, our servers were 100% on top of our needs and really nice on top of it, but one server did come off a bit short when we were not quite ready to order, but honestly I think it's a difference in culture not in service level.   We're definitely coming back soon!",

We came in during lunch hour and the crowd wasn't too bad but you can tell everyone was on their lunch break since they were dress in business attire and had their work badges on.   We order the drunken noodle, pad see ew and Thai coffee. We originally tried ordering appetizers like the stuff chicken wings but they were out and then the Thai toast but they said it will take 30mins to make! So never mind appetizers. The pad see ew was too sweet but the drunken noodle was perfect. We got the spice level 3 and that was pretty spicy.   We ended up ordering desert the sticky rice and mango which this is probably the second time I've ever had it and this one was ok.",

Malee's up in Scottsdale was by far superior in flavor and spice - that place will all out humble your ass in spice if you tell them too...and trust me, I can eat the heat!!    On a side note, and I'm a bit reluctant to note this on here but I'm going to anyway.  I made a nice poke at the owner while paying for my carry out.  I mentioned that i was really looking forward to eating this food...based on the reviews and all and that there was really only one good place for Thai food in Albuquerque and that was quite a ways from my home etc.  we talked a bit more and I shared that j grew up outside Detroit where we were blessed with amazing Thai food etc...among many other great/diverse cultural cuisines etc.  I mentioned that in Detroit we have a lot of Hmong and before I could finish...he interrupted me and just slammed them for \"thinking they know how to make Thai food\"...  Wow.  He went on a bit more but I just signed my slip, smiled and left.    Let me tell you Yelpers about the Hmong.  They were pretty much shit on all over Southeast Asia...after originally being pushed outta China.  After Vietnam, helping our troops navigate the Ho Chi Mihn trail...they basically had a bullseye in there back and had to again, flee yet another homeland.  The lucky ones made it here to the US in the late 70's.  As a result, they brought yet more culture and influence to the US.  Long story short,  their food is amazing.  I could name off seven restaurants in the Detroit area... Let alone the Tri-County area surrounding Detroit, that would absolutely rock your world with great tasting Thai food.  The red curry's are deep red... Their \"pad see ewe\"is a dark brown that is smoky and sweet at the same time.  Don't tell me that the Hmong do not know how to make Thai food... Because as far as I'm concerned, in my humble opinion... They make the best Thai food, period!",

So my review may be a bit skewed because of my personal state of being.  Ambiance is quite nice. Restroom is clean but I do not know if it is by design or just working with space available but there is a giant water heater in mens room that make it quite uncomfortably hot.  Food is absolutely fantastic. Portions are great two people can easily share an appetizer and an entre.  That being said the price is just barely above cheep eats but the food is very good so that is where some of the 5th  went.  Regarding heat preferences for the spicy dishes.

Seems like not a big deal, but, in Phoenix, they're the only ones who do this. I got the drunken noodles and thai tea.... both delicious, both huge - I had a ton of leftovers.

A friend with good food taste said that we had to eat here, and we are so glad he did.  This is truly excellent Thai food and some of the best we've ever had. Additionally, the owners are the type of people you are glad to support as it is clear they thoroughly enjoy what they do -- not to mention they are great at it.  This is a very small, totally unpretentious, family-owned restaurant that is in what looks to be, a little converted house. Try their food once, and I'm betting you will be like us, and be heading back there as soon as possible.  Oh yeah... the coconut pineapple ice cream is amazing as well.",

    "text": "Great Thai food. We stopped in here one day when we had a craving for something different. When we walked in the restaurant was empty and the host was near the kitchen chatting with the cook, but he came as soon as he spotted us and told us to take any table in the place. We commented on the emptiness and he said it would start to fill up soon, which it did. The food was outstanding- flavorful and exactly what we ordered. I had the stir fried noodles and veggies with a level 1 of spice. Really, there was no spice at all but that's what I wanted. The waiter said a few times to let him know if the dish was too sweet. Hubs had curry at I think a 4/5 spice level. It tasted plenty hot to me but he said it could have used more spice. He also ordered a pumpkin curry to go and he said it tasted pretty much like the other curry, so the pumpkin flavor was a bit light. The green tea ice cream was amazing at the end of the meal- very lightly flavored. Oh, and when I mentioned that I am allergic to pistachios (after seeing them on the menu) the waiter said that was fine, and that they could also accommodate a peanut or general tree nut allergy. While I'm not sure how a Thai restaurant could logistically accommodate a severe peanut allergy, all was good on my end as far as the pistachios went.",

Service was not only slow, apparently you have to be on their schedule, but the food order was messed up three times. I ordered the Pad Thai with no eggs and no meat with tofu with a 4 star spicy level. When it came out it had eggs. Then when it came out again, great to see no eggs, but also no tofu.  Finally the third time was the charm, or so I thought.  When it came out again, no eggs and tofu was back, but it was also not spicy at all!  I said to heck with it and just ate it. No attention to details. Trying to get water refills was lengthy and they had a table of people waiting to make an order just up and leave. As we were leaving another couple kept looking around for anyone to take their order. I'm probably not going back.  Too bad.",

I recommend tom ka soup (w/chicken & white rice), stir-fried garlic sauce (w/chicken), spicy sweet basil (w/beef), and the spicy basil noodles. I like that their spicy levels are consistent across time (if you request a 4-spicy level, you won't end up with a 2-spicy level instead) which has always been a problem at other Thai restaurants. Additionally, the staff is REALLY, REALLY nice. The first time i ate here they spontaneously brought out their coconut ice cream for us to try on the house. I always decline dessert since I don't have a sweet tooth, but this was particularly yummy and the perfect ending to a spicy meal. This has been my go-to Thai spot ever since.",

We ordered as soon as we were ready, and our appetizers (shrimp spring rolls) were somehow brought right after our menus were taken away.  Amazing. We didn't even finish our appetizers before our main courses (pork fried rice and yellow curry) were brought over.  HOLY HELL.

That's hard to beat :) Also we are picky eaters, they only use white chicken in all their Curries & when you leave you feel comfortably full. Their food is not greasy at all, in fact I feel it's healthier than eating at other places. The owner Mod is a very genuine guy.

The service here is amazing!!!   The host/waiter greeted my buddy and I right away. Seated us at a nice area and proceeded to have nice small talk to make us feel very welcomed! He took the time to assist us with the menu and was very patient answering all our questions. We told him this was our first time here and he jumped at the opportunity to recommend the popular items. Our beverages was always filled and food came out timely. At one point our waiter came by and told us our interior car light was on. He was concerned that it would drain our battery. Wow! That's the first time I ever had a host pay attention in detail and care enough to let us know.   The restaurant had a nice welcoming atmosphere and awesome decorations.  The food was amazingly delicious! It's was seasoned perfectly and spiced the right way. We had our dishes at the medium spice level and that was perfect for us. It gave me enough spice to make me sweat a little but nothing close to being to hot to be unable to eat my dish. My buddy and I ordered the Panang with Beef and the Spicy Eggplant with Roast Duck. The Panang had a great texture with the right about of coconut taste. Beef was thinly sliced and just melted in my mouth. The spicy eggplant was orgasmic! I recommend it with the Roast Duck because the juices from the Duck gave it a special taste. This dish is easily my favorite. We didn't leave a single piece of food on our plates! Demolished!  The service and food was so amazing we tipped 100%! They deserved it!  I will definitely be back here if I'm in the area!",

After letting the restaurant know, they simply refused to accept it, like customers mean nothing.  This is after 40 minutes of waiting for food and rude customer service from the staff. Oh, our appetizers came 15 minutes after our entree. Don't come here- go to the one on broadway!",

The server was very attentive to our large party and was glad to suggest items we might like. We decided to order several appetizers and a soup to share along with our own meals. The soup, a coconut broth, was amazing! Everyone loved it. Just the right amount of sweet and spicy. The chicken satay was also good, though several of the pieces we received were fatty. I ordered the pad see-yew which was very good and perfectly cooked. The others at my table ordered spicy eggplant, drunken noodles, and fried rice. We all shared our meals and all of the food was absolutely delicious. All cooked perfectly and good quality. At the end of the meal they brought out complimentary coconut ice cream which was also delicious. Highly recommend giving this place a try. Not in the best area and outside was a little sketchy, but definitely worth checking out.",

I ordered the chicken fried rice lunch special which came with a veggie spring roll and wontons along with sweet and sour sauce. My rice was a little more on the soggy side; I wouldn't necessarily say it was fried rice, but it was still very flavorful. Everything tasted really good & their pieces of chicken are nice and big yet thin so it works out perfectly.  The restaurant is nicely decorated & quaint. They offered me a complimentary drink while I picked up my order and it was a nice gesture. I am still very eager to try some of their noodles because I have heard they are really delicious. Also, they ask what level of spice you'd like your food at, and I think thats great because I do prefer some spice in my dishes!",

I love that they put mushrooms in it and no tomatoes. Very complex flavors that are well developed. The Red Curry chicken is the most amazing curry I have ever had. Very coconutty. The vegetables are crisp, but cooked well.  The sauce for the Pad Thai is incredibly well developed and delicious! The only complaint is the amount of rice we received for take out - it really could be more generous.  Really a delicious Thai place!",

However the panang curry with vegetables, drunken noodles tofu with vegetables and the vegetarian pad thai were pretty tasty and what we ordered for the night. Panang had a nice balance between the curry, coconut and peantuts. It was not soupy but pretty thick. Just enough heat. The drunken noodles had a good flavor and they fry their tofu before they put it in the meals. Fresh vegetables including peppers, broccoli, cabbage and carrots....very generous with the amount of veggies and sprouts. A 4 was plenty of heat ranging from a 1-5 with 5 being thai hot....  We even got a scoop coconut ice cream at the end of our meal....  Restaurant had plenty of booths and tables, not crowded at all and weight time was minimal!!!  Not the best, but definitely not the worst either.",

Only reason I gave this restaurant two stars is because of the restraunt itself.  It's nice and clean inside and the satff is decently friendly. That's the good, now the bad.  I stuck with my usual for a new Thai restaurant, Pad Thai and wonton soup.  I got the lunch option so had no choice in meat and it came with chicken and one lone shrimp.  The Pad Thai was super saucy though it was decently flavored. However due to the amount of sauce it was not enjoyable. And the wonton  soup was so salty I think they used sea water to cook it.  I honestly don't know why this place has as good of a rating as it does but after this experience I definitely won't give it another shot to redeem itself.",

I will say the neighborhood and the interior decor at this location are far superior. While the service at broadway was exemplary (complimentary ice cream and bottled water while I waited for my order to be filled as an example), on baseline I have found it to be indifferent. Thus, i wanted to post regarding my experience three days ago.  My complaints are that I had asked for plastic silverware on my to go order as I am staying in a hotel, but this was forgotten. Second, when I ordered, I was not asked how spicy I wanted my pineapple green curry. I normally order 3, but I think the cashier assumed I was not an experienced thai food eater and requested a 1.  The food was delicious, but could have been better with a small customer service effort. Also kind of strange that after I ordered, I stood by the counter for maybe 10 min while they prepped my food and none of the maybe 6 people who approached smiled or acknowledged my presence. Some small and simple customer service tweaks would go a long way. Good restaurant but make the drive to broadway if you want to be wowed.",

We are newish to the area and have tried about 6 or 7 thai places and Chanpen on baseline is my favorite!!! They do such a great job and it's really cute inside. We tend to be serial pad Thai, drunken noodles, and red or yellow curry orderers. All of these are really good here. I saw some past reviews say the pad Thai was sweet and saucey which kept me away from going here for a few months but it's not sweet or saucey to me. It's just delicious. I get a number 3 spice level.",

I will start by saying the service could be improved, it was a little slow despite the fact that it wasn't that busy. By slow I don't mean the speed of the food but rather the fact I had to ask twice for napkins and my drink. The appetizer arrived before my soda and the meals arrived literally 5 minutes later. We had no room on our table and they placed our entrees on the table next to ours. You might be wondering why I rated it 4 stars then? Well, I appreciate good food and it was VERY good, I can overlook a few things here and there. Would I go back? Heck YES! And....I will try allll of their curries. If you order spicy be aware they don't mess around, hot is HOT! I asked for mild and it was still a little spicy for me. Very delicious, good prices, good portions. Definitely going back.",

I wish my curry had a little more sauce, it was a little bit dry but in other hand I'm grateful because there was enough pork and chicken  also I wish I had gotten more shrimps and beef because it was not proportional with the rest of the plate, but they concede to substitute green peppers instead of potatoes on my curry.

    "text": "I haven't found my \"go to \"Thai place in Tempe yet but this one is pretty close I think.  Another visit could possibly determine that.  I stopped in last week for a quick lunch with a co-worker for my first visit.  We arrived around 12:30 pm and it was a nice lunch crowd but still plenty of seating.  Within the first maybe 2 minutes of sitting down the server came over to ask us if we were ready to order.  I could tell they were used to having regular customers because she gave us no time to look over the menu.  No big deal!  She came back a few minutes later, this time we were ready.  I ordered the Pan Thai with Chicken and Shrimp with a number 2 spice level.  She ordered a vegetarian dish (I can't remember the name). Within a few minutes our soup came out pipin' hot.  Great!  I love really hot soup!  Before we finished out sop, our entrees came out.    Immediately upon looking at my food I noticed a huge shrimp sitting directly on the top of the dish.  I thought great!  They're not cutting corners there. I quickly skimmed though my dish to locate the rest of the shrimp and chicken and was disappointed to find only ONE shrimp.  That one, huge, lonely shrimp sitting on top of my noodles - That's it!  No other shrimp anywhere.  There were about 3 pieces of finely sliced chicken, lots of fried egg and the noodles. The flavors of everything were super good.  My spice level was 2 and that was perfect. Anything higher I wouldn't be able to handle.    As mentioned, I was highly disappointed with the portion of chicken and shrimp in my lunch, however, maybe it wouldn't be the same situation if I were ordering dinner.  I do plan to try them out again soon for lunch and will update my review.",

    "text": "My last Thai food review - a couple weeks ago - was 2 stars.  It is with GREAT pleasure that I had some really delicious Thai food last night.   I was driving by, saw a \"strip mall\" on the corner, and their lit sign caught my  eye. Lucky break.   I love Thai food, and I've had Thai food in Thailand, Vietnam and the States: I've known the good, the bad and the ugly. Weirdly, the favorite Thai food I'd had was in a small town in North Vietnam.  Last night I think it was beaten! And I wasn't even planning to grab dinner- whew.   I always ask a good waiter their suggestions for the best dishes that night. I had a fantastic waiter who- when he saw I was a \"foodie\"- was beyond helpful in suggesting dishes I would love.   He specifically said, \"get the eggplant, it's so delicious...\". I couldn't quite picture that, but he convinced me. I also ordered a curry- a real test of the food-and asked for shrimp. He said , \" get chicken for the curry, and the shrimp for the eggplant-trust me\". He also suggested a different curry, saying it was HIS favorite. Okay then.   When it came, I immediately saw what the eggplant dish was about; chocked full of thick delicious mushrooms and other perfectly cooked veggies. The shrimp were larger than any I've seen in Thai dishes.    The curry had a thick, delicious sauce, and the chicken was tender and not a single piece of fat! That's rare.  The flavor of the sauces was beyond description. I think it was the best curry I've ever had: p-nutty and spiced just right. The sauce in the eggplant was unusual, thinner and absolutely stunning!    They even had sticky rice and mango for desert! Oh joy. I had to try it- not many have it. I sure enjoyed it, stuffed or not.   I have enough leftovers for two more meals, and I'm sure happy about that.   See the pictures- and GO to this great little gem.",

    "text": "Man, I love Thai food. So much diversity and layer after layer of texture and flavor; all with just the right spice. Chanpen does not skimp when it comes to flavor. Their food was delicious. Excellent. I got two entrees just so I'd have those coveted Thai leftovers when the midnight munchies kick in. Panang Curry and Pad See Ew.   This place could definitely use a bit more night time ambiance. The overhead fluorescent lights were a bit distracting and sterile. If they had some softer lighting dispersed through the restaurant, that would take this place to another level. Some soft music would be a plus too! All that stuff doesn't really matter though cause the food was so good.  The service was slow and a bit inattentive, but once the food came out, I stopped caring real quick. I had stepped into another world. After my meal, I was brought some complementary and homemade coconut-pineapple ice cream. F@*$ing delicious. Thank you Chanpen. I will be back. I will bring my money.  Food-wise, this place is easily among the top Thai restaurants here in Arizona. I may have to find a way to marry into the family.",

Not the crunch you're looking for. My boyfriends panang curry tasted like it was a premade sauce or package. Quite frankly all of it did. Its not too special in my eyes, I felt i had wasted $30.",

All of it was very tasty and flavorful! It was quick service and good sizes. However, something stood out that dropped this to a 2 star. The problem is that I had ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice, which came with shrimp and chicken. However, my fried rice had no shrimp at all. I had brought it up to the waiter, who looked a bit confused that it was missing but said \"ok\" and walked away. He came back about 5-10 mins later with 2 pieces of shrimp. Look at the picture I uploaded. It looks like it was just boiled and stuck in a dish, pathetic! I paid for SHRIMP and Chicken, not a cheaper dish. Not cool at all! My future visits to the Phoenix area will not include this place!",

    "text": "I have never been a fan of Asia food because every time I have it soon after I am hungry. So, since my appetite was back so soon over the years I really started to disliked Asia cuisine. Until about three months ago on our way home from school. I ask my son where he wanted to eat, and he replied Thai food. so, I was like really Asia food you know I do not like Asia food, but I said ok let's give this place a try. The first thing I recall is as soon as we walked in the door the welcoming greeting as you get into the restaurant.  I was very unsure, but my first time here was for lunch as soon as we walk in there was no waiting list they sat us right away. The overall floor plan was open the street view had open glass windows and even the booths had low backrest which I thought was awesome because you could 360 degrees and I did not feel like I was in a building. we sat at a booth all their table tops were white granite. The chairs and booth benches were covered with a soft white padded cushion and there framing was painted black. The tables tops empty there is not cluttered with salt and pepper shakers, soy bottles or did not have l the little advertisement menus. The floor had that wood looking tile which was dark brown or even a black with a light color grout.  Within five minutes you are greeted by your waitress who gives you your menu then walk off and brings you water glasses that are served in mason jars with a slice of cucumbers. Then you get a cup of soup that has peas and cabbage which sounds weird but is very testy. So, my son ordered the yellow curry with side of white streamed rice and served with two sides 1 egg roll and 2 fried wontons all of their lunch special come with the egg roll and 2 wontons with sweet and sour to eat with your egg roll. I kept it simple by ordering their sweet and sour chicken which had slice tomatoes, onion, Bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers and was topped with an amazing the sweet tangy sauce. The waitress asks how hot I wanted my sauce there are 5 levels 0-5 with 5 being the hottest. Then I added a chili level of 4. Also, with side of white steamed rice. Their meals are served white glass plates. My heart dropped skipped a beat right after my first bit it. The amount of heat for the chili flavoring I was like wow I think I am in love with Thai. The service time was quick I would say we were in and out with-in 40 minutes tops I lost track of time because it was that good.  After we were done eating we got the check and I was shocked by the price because the bill was around $17.48 for two lunch specials each meal $7.95 plus tax. I figured I was going to pay more. the sweet and sour chicken had a crunchy but soft breading hold down the chili and sweet and tangy sauce together was on point put it this way I had other Thai places in Tempe and I think their prices are equal and even up to five dollars more and the food is not as good it is ok but hands down I give this place 5 stars out of 5 stars because their food is out of this world.  If you get a chance and want to try or even had some delicious Thai food this how good this place is I have eaten there one a week for last 3 months and tried something different each time I have not find any I don't like I would really recommend dinner because they make their own ice cream and give it for dessert the one time I was their it was pineapple flavor IT IS OFF THE HOOK!!!!

It is full of flavor and spice, delivering satisfaction with every bite. They did justice on my favorite thai dish - pad see ew. The noodles were soft, the beef was tender, and the broccoli and carrots added a nice touch of crunch and freshness. Be careful on the spice factor here though. It is rated 1-5 and I went with my usual order of 3/5; it is noticeably spicier than similar spice ratings at other Thai restaurants.   The only reason this place didn't receive 5 stars was because the service could have been better, especially since it was not very busy while I was dining. The servers were very polite but didn't seem too attentive. It wasn't completely terrible service but our group did have to flag the server down a time or two.   Be sure to try to come at lunch time during the week as they have many great lunch special options. This place is sure to please newcomers to Thai food as well as experienced foodies.",

When we inquired about where we could buy some lime leaves in the area (we've been searching), our server not only showed us on his phone, but gave us a little to-go bag for our cooking at home! This plus the complementary coconut ice cream given to us at the end of the meal will leave us taking about the amazing service for sometime to come.  On to the food...delicious! We had the coconut soup with chicken (broth was so tasty--lots and lots of mushrooms), pad see ew with beef (kids loved it), and panang with pork (a bit thick, but flavors spot on).

Who I was with ordered the Pad Thai and the noodles were a bit too thin. Maybe another dish may be better, but those weren't the best.

I'm quite particular when it comes to chicken and it's safe to say this does not have a squishy or weird texture like another place I tried. C'mon, let's be honest I know we all had that one bad experience. LOL!  Food: Well it was tasty, spicy and good all at the same damn time! I must say if you like shrimp and chicken you'll love their Chicken + Shrimp Pad Thai. Upon ordering you are asked for the (evil) spice level: 1-5! I chose 3 which was pretty spicy and I love spicy! I ordered mine without shrimp and added vegetables for $10.95.   Thank you for staying late for us! It was our fault we stopped by 30 minutes before closing but we really appreciate it and were in awe with the food. Can't wait to come back and tell others!",

It is with GREAT pleasure that I had some really delicious Thai food last night.   I was driving by, saw a \"strip mall\" on the corner, and their lit sign caught my  eye. Lucky break.   I love Thai food, and I've had Thai food in Thailand, Vietnam and the States: I've known the good, the bad and the ugly. Weirdly, the favorite Thai food I'd had was in a small town in North Vietnam.  Last night I think it was beaten! And I wasn't even planning to grab dinner- whew.   I always ask a good waiter their suggestions for the best dishes that night. I had a fantastic waiter who- when he saw I was a \"foodie\"- was beyond helpful in suggesting dishes I would love.   He specifically said, \"get the eggplant, it's so delicious...\". I couldn't quite picture that, but he convinced me. I also ordered a curry- a real test of the food-and asked for shrimp. He said , \" get chicken for the curry, and the shrimp for the eggplant-trust me\". He also suggested a different curry, saying it was HIS favorite. Okay then.   When it came, I immediately saw what the eggplant dish was about; chocked full of thick delicious mushrooms and other perfectly cooked veggies. The shrimp were larger than any I've seen in Thai dishes.    The curry had a thick, delicious sauce, and the chicken was tender and not a single piece of fat! That's rare.  The flavor of the sauces was beyond description. I think it was the best curry I've ever had: p-nutty and spiced just right. The sauce in the eggplant was unusual, thinner and absolutely stunning!    They even had sticky rice and mango for desert! Oh joy. I had to try it- not many have it. I sure enjoyed it, stuffed or not.   I have enough leftovers for two more meals, and I'm sure happy about that.   See the pictures- and GO to this great little gem.",

    "text": "Stumbled across this restaurant with my coworkers and I have to say that the food here is probably one the best Thai food I've ate so far. We started out with some pot stickers and cream cheese puffs. They were very good. Pot stickers was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just perfect. The cream cheese puffs had the right amount of cream cheese. We also order their coconut chicken with rice and I never thought, coconut curry is so good! We also order their coconut soup and I fell in love with it! The coconut with the mixture of tom yum flavor made the soup so savory! We also order rice with stir fry ground pork and the seasoning is just perfect! However, pad thai was not my favorite as it is on the sweeter side and very saucy.   Anyways! I will definitely recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to be back!",

Delicious. Fast attentive service. Tons of options and all so flavorful. We enjoyed the pad Thai shrimp, Penang curry and stir fried broccoli with chicken. All number \"3\" for heat and it was just the right amount of runny nose without killing tastebuds. Will definitely be back. And my team that never had Thai before? They're sold!!",

While we waited they were kind enough to bring us some bottled water and some homemade coconut ice cream. I'm not a fan of coconut and I didn't want to be rude so I ate a few bites and gave my daughter the rest. It tastes good but I'd like it better with out the coconut flakes. If it didn't have that I'd eat the whole thing but keep in mind that I'm. It a fan of coconut but my daughter loved it. The pad see eww had American broccoli in it which i plucked out because I'm used to eating it with the Chinese broccoli. I also took out the bean sprouts. I like bean sprouts but don't feel that it belongs in the pad see ewe. In all my years eating Thai food I've never seen anyone out bean sprouts in it. The flavor was good. My boyfriend ordered 3 on the spicy scale and our complaint on the one is that the spice wasn't cooked into the food but sprinkled on top so it wasn't mixed in at all which means there is no even distribution of the heat. Other than that the food was good. I've had better but it's good. Customer service is on point and the restaraunt itself was nice.",

Parking was easy since it's in a strip mall like area. The waitress was hard to communicate with she didn't listen well especially for the fact that English was her second language. Note: English isn't my parents first language so we're quite used to this, but it was difficult for us. Tried the following dishes and nothing was memorable: fried rice, sate, pad see ew, pad thai your typical Thai staples. I've had so much better in Cincinnati, Columbus, and Milwaukee and these are large cities.  The only thing that was good was the Tom yum soup. Good variety of elements as well as a solid heat and sourness that I love.",

So we went in and they told us to sit wherever. The waitress brought water and our soups. We noticed she was taking longer than usual and seem to be attending other guest more than us. So we tried to get her attention and that didnt work. So we tried to get the waiters attention, we thought he didn't hear us. Tried to get his attention again and clearly ignored us. The waiter was attending the table next to us, those customers told him that we were trying to get his attention. The waiter tells those two customers, \" oh they always come here but leave no tip.\" Our jaws dropped! We've been loyal customers and were regulars. For that waiter to tell that to other customers was not only disrespectful but unprofessional. I will never go back in this restaurant. I have never been so embarrassed. We asked for the waiters name and to speak to the manager and were told that the manager would be in later. We walked back \"later\" and no manager. To the owner of this restaurant, if that's the type of wait staff you have working for you then expect to lose business for waiters/waitresses that feel they are obligated to receive tips for below average service.",

    "text": "I was so pleased to learn that Chanpen opened a new location 4 weeks ago and it is larger to accommodate more people with the same great quality of food.   The location is in the Fry's Food plaza, on the northeast corner of 48th Street and Baseline in Tempe. The atmosphere is open and clean, with more tables to accommodate parties small and large.   I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special for $7.95 and it came with soup, a veggie eggroll and a wonton crisp. It was, as expected, extremely good.   The staff is very nice and I had a chance to chat with one of the co-owners. All in all I hope that this place succeeds because it has the best Thai food in the Phoenix area.",

The waiters were adorable. We will definitely come back!!!",

The first time I ate at Chanpen Thai it was about 6 years ago, my old bosses brought me lunch and I was in love with every dish. From that day on I ate Chanpen Thai every other day.   After moving from Arizona to Miami I have tried 20 or more different places and nothing compares to Chanpen Thai.  They have the best curry and the best fried rise also the best best Pad Thai. You can also order it different type of spicy level from 1 being the lowest in spice and 5 being the hottest lol don't get it! We always get 3-4 or get a 3 and ask for extra spice on the side.   So if you decide to dine in your experience will be much better. You get greeted right away and you can sit anywhere you choose also no reservations need it.   The service is so fast they bring big mason jars of water with limo right away and then get your order. At the end of your meal they bring you a free desert. Usually the ice cream of the day and it's made the same day. You will love it, portions are big enough to share but usually you will want your own plate or order few plates so you can try a little of everything and take home the rest.   My mouth is watering right now and wishing I was in Arizona.",

We ordered an appetizer of the crab cheese puffs that were cooked well, not too crispy but the wrapper wasn't too thick either. Perfect combination of crab chunks and cheese too which was great to see!   I ordered the chicken pad Thai for my entree which came out piping hot and delicious! I can't do too much spice so opted for a 1 spice level which ended up being perfect for my 5-year old palette. It was slightly sweeter than I'm used too but the noodles were well cooked, the sauce wasn't too heavy, and the chicken wasn't overdone or dry.   My husband honestly can't remember what his dish was called but it was a yellow curry with noodles and crispy noodles on top. The waitress recommended it and it was so good he literally wanted to lick the bowl when it was done!   Happy with our first visit! Will definitely be back!",

On the second visit, they didn't have chow mein available, which was a letdown, but we ordered two Pad Thai plates instead and were not disappointed; one with with chicken and shrimp and another with a combo of 4 protein; chicken, shrimp, pork, ans beef.  My hubby was thrilled with the amount of protein on the pad Thai.  He was in meat heaven.  As an appetizer, we tried the chicken satay which comes with a creamy peanut sauce and is a good portion for the money.   We wanted to try a few Thai beers, so we ordered the Singha lager which was more on the malty side, and Chang, which Hubby loved because it was so refreshing.  They even used proper glassware, which made this beer nerd swoon!   At the end of the meal they bring you a free scoop of ice cream.  I am a huge fan of the coconut flavor that has little chunks of fresh coconut.  The green tea is pretty tasty too.",

It was excellent and easily tipped the scale to 5 stars because now I don't need to go to the donut shop next door for ice cream!  The Pad Thai is very good ($11) and comes with both chicken and Shrimp. There wasn't a whole lot of chicken even though I asked for extra chicken and NO shrimp!  But since I don't need a lot of meat I was fine. (There is also a vegetarian option ($10).  I thought it was a bit dry and not as sweet as I prefer so I asked for a side of Hoisin sauce which made it perfect.   The red curry with Tofu ($12) was also very flavorful. We forgot to ask for brown rice and the waitress didn't ask our preference. It came with white rice...so we asked for brown. It was still cooking but came about 10 minutes later. The menu states to pick the spice level 0-5. I ordered my Pad Thai \"zero\" (and it had zero heat)! But I accidentally ordered the red curry MILD which should have been ordered zero because \"mild\" was really too spicy for me. My husband was fine with it.   It's interesting that both dishes looked as bland on the plate as they do in the pictures. There isn't any effort to add slivered carrots to the Pad Thai to give it some color, etc. But the bland look is not a problem once you take a bite.   If we are through here again we will return, and hopefully on a week day 11-3! when the lunch specials look great and more reasonably priced!  If you find this review useful, please vote!",

Usually I get the chicken choice with the entree I chose, either the Rah-na, Drunken Noodle or Teriyaki, or my new FAVORITE the Cashew Stir-fry, but tonight, I tried the veggie option and it was so amazing. Filled to the top with all my favorite things. I didn't think it would fill me up as well as the chicken but it did, I'd unbutton my pants if it wasn't considered inappropriate. We also opted to try to Wonton soup tonight which is served with a mini fire underneath to keep the soup warm, which is the coolest thing I have ever seen, especially with my \"cold soup\" phobia. The complimentary ice cream to clean and calm our palate afterwards is always our favorite part of meal. Oh and not to mention, their thai tea is always the best.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place with a group of friends on a Monday evening. I've heard good things about their Broadway location in Phoenix and when a friend suggested this larger location, we were on board. It wasn't too busy around 530/6 and I immediately loved the vibe and aesthetics of the restaurant, felt inviting and well decorated.   We stuck with water for our drinks and ordered different entrees: avocado curry, green curry, pad see eww and I got the spring rolls appetizer and vegetables pad thai with tofu. Everyone enjoyed their dishes; I liked my rolls but would've preferred a peanut sauce to accompany them rather than their sweet sauce, also could've used more shrimp. My dish was fantastic, I chose a 4/5 spice level and it was packing serious heat. I was happy not eating much because I ended up with leftovers for two days. Even the leftovers were tasty, and they weren't as spicy since the microwave can only heat up food so much versus a skillet or pot.  After our plates were cleared and boxed up, one of the staff members brought us complimentary green tea ice cream, which was a lovely ending to our meal. Our waitress was efficient and kind as she made sure we were attended to and split our checks. FYI: they add an 18% gratuity to parties of 6 or more, but you can add to it if you'd like. Overall, I have nothing bad to say about Chanpen and look forward to trying other dishes and visiting their original location.",

What I loved most was that both the curries were thick, just the way I like it! Very flavorful! And for $7.95?? I'd have gladly paid more. I have one suggestion though, if you like your curries spicy, go with the medium spicy option. If you tell them to go a little over medium spicy, trust me they'd take your request very seriously :D such a great find!!! And the servers arr sweet!",

    "text": "Absolutely the best place I've ever eaten in Tempe, and this may now end up being the *only* place I will eat in Tempe.   Walk in with a group of three and we're immediately acknowledged and are seated. Water in these adorable mason jars is brought and we are looking over the menu. Friendly service from start to finish.   The table tried out their appetizer sampler platter. After waiting a few minutes for it to come out, a server comes out and apologizes, stating that they are out of the \"fresh rolls\" that are supposed to be part of the appetizer plate. This really is not a big deal to me, and I assume they'll just add an extra egg roll or something. But instead she has brought out 6 chicken skewers for us instead and is apologizing again. It was such a great way for them to apologize. And the chicken skewers are amazing, by the way--they come with a really amazing peanut sauce!   The rest of the platter follows. Egg rolls are on point, very crispy (just like I like them to be!). Crab puffs were great and have nice chunks of crab inside of them. Really good grab to creme cheese mixture and they were cooked perfectly. There were also potstickers, which were also glamorous and those were eaten rather quickly. The big bacon wrapped shrimp were good, and this is a big thing for me to say because normally I'm not a shrimp fan--but they were great.   Moral: The appetizers here are amazing and I highly recommend everything!   As for the entrees, one guest at the table got a standard chicken mein dish and it was amazing. Lots of veggies in the portion which was nice. And the portion was very big as well.   Me and another guest got the yellow curry------yes! Great taste, great portion, the potatoes were nicely cooked, loved the carrots, and the chicken was very tender. The best curry I've had in awhile and I absolutely loved it. LOVED it.   As we were paying the server brought out complimentary green tea ice cream, again, great service. Very delicious.   I'll definitely be back here when I return to Tempe or just drive through. This was a great little location that had good ambience, stellar service, and even better food. Thanks for having us!",

There weren't that many tables filled, but the customer service was very attentive and conversational, so the vibe of this place was causal and welcoming. The food was also amazing. I typically get Pad See Yew at Thai restaurants and it was one of the best I've had, and the best I've had in Arizona. Then my boyfriend got the Panang curry and it was so nutty and flavorful, I almost regretted getting Pad See Yew. And to top off this great dining experience, they gave us green tea ice cream. And it didn't taste store bought either. The only thing I would criticize is that they didn't really give us or offer usual condiments I've had at Thai restaurants, like fish sauce with Thai chiles, or little jalapenos with soy sauce, and etc.",

Great service, topped with delicious food and was decently priced... man, you got us. Apparently we'd been waiting some time for our food as they apologized and offered us veggie spring rolls which despite the lack of meat was just yumms-and that's coming from an avid meat eater. We didn't really notice the wait as we were jamming out to the eccelctic music selection ranging from Kpop, to Thai pop, to early 2000 slow jams. We'd eaten here before but this was the first time we devoured everything in one sitting. We ordered the chicken larb, pad Thai, and spicy basil fried rice.  everything was deloycious, perfectly portioned, and just hit all the right spots. They topped us off with a green tea ice cream (last time they had coconut) which was just the perfect end. Will come back, will recommend to anyone who's hungry. Chanpen...you got us. We got gotten.  Wanted to note, it's rare to find a thai place that isn't afraid to give you the spice level you ask for, almost anywhere. Not watered down, but real spice. Accidentally asked for a 10 once and they did not play (didn't realize their scale was 0-5). It was still so good but definitely a mistake. Stuck to their scale this time and everything was perfection.",

    "text": "Chanpen Thai serves up a decent meal in this part of Tempe and has enough vegetarian options to keep things interesting for more than one meal.   The carrots were crinkle cut, but the broccoli tasted like it was never frozen. The tofu was gently fried before going into any dish, which was a nice touch. Chanpen added chili oil when I asked for a dish to be spicier - there wasn't a thai chili pepper taste. They didn't ask how hot I wanted my dishes to be, an oddity for a Thai restaurant, but something I'm encountering more frequently. The Thai hot here was probably a medium hot elsewhere. The curry and noodle dishes were a bit too sweet.   Do you ever wonder what the history of baby corn is, and how it made its way into your stir-fried noodles and my drunken noodles? Which consumer segment continues to demand baby corn such that it commands a huge per pound premium over full grown corn? I really don't like the taste, so I'm a bit puzzled. This is something worth digging up on NPR or Wikipedia, but I feel a twinge of laziness coming on.   It was never quite clear if lunch was counter service or sit down. The food came out quickly here though. Chanpen was never busy either - I went for lunch and dinner, sometimes alone and with colleagues, and never ran into a wait or crowded restaurant.   If you don't feel like driving further into Tempe or Phoenix, this is probably the only Thai restaurant in a decent radius. Thai Elephant Bistro is nearby, but isn't necessarily a step change above Chanpen.",

My drunken noodles for lunch were a little spicier than I usually get, but really good.  My mom's pad thai was also pretty warm, and was served with lemon instead of lime.  WTF? Who does that? Are there no limes in Phoenix? I have to have a crap ton of fresh lime juice to enjoy pad thai, but my mom isn't as into it as I am.  I would have sent it back, but I didn't order it so its a moot point.  Let's just say that my husband's yellow curry that he ordered as a 4/5 was too hot for me to even try.  It was just about too hot for him to eat.  And believe me, he likes stuff hot.  He said it was just about the hottest Thai he'd ever had.  I think we'll be back, since forewarned is forearmed!  I'll be sticking with a 1 or 2, he'll probably knock his down to a 2 or 3.  Now, I wasn't a fan of the cucumber water but it was drinkable.  My food was hot enough that I would have drunk it even if it wasn't.  Service was terrible, though.  I don't feel its unreasonable to expect you to keep my glass full, or to get my husband some water without cucumber in it.  They weren't able to manage to meet my expectations on that front.  Their prices were reasonable and the value for money was all right.  So it's a mixed bag.  Try it for lunch and stick with low numbers, you'll be fine.",

We tried the standards: Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and Royal Curry. All were delicious. As with all Thai food, be careful on the spice level you choose. You get to choose from 0-5. I first tried 1. It was good, but personally, I like a lot more spice so I added chili sauce to it. The next time, I ordered 3. Perfect. Spicy enough to have you mouth breathing and drinking water between bites, but not so spicy that you can't enjoy the flavor.  When in doubt, choose a low number and add spice as needed. The lunch special is a good deal; cheap for Thai food. The employees are really nice. They gave us complimentary green tea ice cream on my first visit. When I ordered takeout for lunch the second time, they brought me water and soup while I waited. I'm actually going back for lunch right now.  LOL!!  Oh. I didn't give five stars because it's not the best Thai food I've had. But the price, service and quality is good enough to keep going back.",

    "text": "I tried Chanpen after reading the positive reviews here and wow, great hidden gem!  I did a takeout order of Yellow Chicken Curry, which wasn't on their menu, but they were accommodating, Salad rolls and chown mein thai style noodles.  They need to put it on the menu because the chicken was tender, the sauce was creamy, fragrant, sweet and spicy to our liking.  It was a generous portion for the price. The salad rolls with shrimp were hefty with lettuce, bean sprouts and shrimp wrapped in rice paper.  A meal in itself, but that didn't stop me from trying the other entrees and finishing everyone else's remaining morsels!  Now because the noodles were in a styrofoam to go container, it wasn't airtight so the sauce spilled out into the plastic carrying bag as it was driving home.  That was a downer, but the yakisoba noodles were covered with carrots, onions, crunchy cabbage, lots of tender chicken slices.  My kids would have liked more noodles but it was enough for 3 kids. No leftovers after this takeout adventure! So this was a successful Friday find! Yeah. I think the restaurant is quaint and beautifully decorated with booths and tables.  The service was fine.  Sorry no pics since we were super hungry and it smelled so diviine I forgot to take pics.",

I ordered one seafood coconut soup and beef panang, despite the fancy look, the soup was ok, and i found a piece of pork inside it and i dont eat pork at all. The beef panang was below average, i feel more tomatoes soup than the panang curry and i ordered it level 4, so it was supposed to be super spicy , the actual spicy level i tasted was 2. The staff are very nice and kind though. Conclusion, the food is just ok or below average despite the good fancy look.",

Had the shrimp fresh rolls, pad Thai, coconut curry and were served coconut ice cream scoops at the end of the meal.  Really sweet staff and a cute little restaurant despite it being in the strip of a Freys supermarket. Total bill was $36 including a $6 tip. Will definitely be back!",

It was hot and tasty with 3.5-star heat, and big shrimp and plenty of big fresh pineapple chinks, plus lots of tasty chicken.     I was ready to add soy sauce but nothing was really needed. The stir fried snow peas with beef was a mild and tasty treat.There were lots of onions, thin slices of beef, and carrots.    They served up tea flavored ice cream gratis and it was delicious. They were out of coconut ice cream a house favorite. I want to sample their Panang curry on our next visit.",

Even the baby was happy ;)    We started with an order of crab wonton which was delicious.    And then I \"chickened out\" and ordered the sweet & sour chicken.   I was really pleased with it.   Far too many times, I have ordered this dish from other restaurants only to find that the sauce drowning the chicken is store bought and entirely too sweet.    Clearly, Chanpen's sweet and sour sauce is housemade and that makes all the difference in how this dish tastes, on top of the fact that the chicken itself was perfectly cooked.   Both of the ladies in our group were more adventurous and ordered curry dishes (one in a level 2 heat and the other in a level 3) and coconut soup, and both reported they were very pleased.  I tried all of the above and it was all quite tasty.   After dinner, they brought us all a small portion of green tea ice cream.  Let me tell you, the baby loved that.  After being a little fussy during dinner, that kid piped down and loved every bit of that ice cream!     Service was great - attentive and friendly.   Great dinner spot!",

The first time we went, we ordered with a spice level of 3 and it was spicy but manageable. The second time, we ordered three again and it was significantly spicier (but still delicious between gulps of water). I would recommend ordering one level lower than you normally would.

It could also be that I didn't order the right things and possibly their other entrees are tastier.  We ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken and the silver noodles stir fried with vegetables and shrimp.  What I love about Thai food is how flavorful the food is and that the flavors always have lots of depth, with lots of different spices, etc.  The flavors here fell a little flat for me.  The pineapple fried rice could have used more herbs and maybe basil or something, because it just had that yellow curry taste to me.  Same for the silver noodles, the flavor wasn't wonderful.  I will say they did give me a lot of shrimp, and the shrimp were really BIG!  The Thai tea also wasn't my favorite. There was too much cream and not enough tea.  I did appreciate the complimentary coconut icecream for dessert, that was a nice tough, although I am lactose intolerant so I only took a small nibble to be polite.  It tasted good though!  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like coconut ate his whole iceream portion.  The restaurant itself is so nice looking inside.  I love that they separated it out into two sections.  One section has these modern booths and the other side has regular tables. It'd be a nice place to host a large group (bc when we came on Saturday night there was only 1 other table).  I may come back here and try a different dish, but so far my other favorite Thai restaurants are preferred.",

It was not the overly battered fried junk. It was lightly coated, sauted, and finished in a wonderful sauce accompanied by fresh cubed pineapple. They provided complimentary orange sherbert after the entrees - nicely done but we went for the coconut icecream served with a side of crushed peanuts and chocolate sauce to drizzle.

It is located in a strip mall next to boba/donut place. The pad see ew was delicious. The pad thai had an orange hue that I was not used to. Everything else was great. I look forward to coming back.",

They know what they're doing with their lunch service. They understand how people that work in nearby offices want to get in and out on their lunch breaks and they do it better than anywhere else! They are so fast and efficient at lunch time. I will always recommend this place for excellent food and service, but there is simply no beating their lunchtime hustle to get you fed in a reasonable amount of time. Definitely consider this for your next lunch meeting!",

Fair warning though- the spice level here was more intense than we have experienced at other Thai restaurants. I usually order a 3, but found my pad Thai to be much spicier than I'm used to. It was still delicious, but made my eyes water! Also, complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of the meal is a lovely touch! Would definitely go again!",

Once we got the food they handed us the check immediately and didn't really bother to come check up or refill drinks.   Other than the the food was decent. I always order the lemongrass soup with seafood with a level 3 spice. The flavorful is great if you like lemongrass. It is served on a hot pot type thing which keeps your soup hot!:) It is enough to feed at least 3 people. The seafood portion for the soup is plenty. It comes with mussels, squid, fish and a couple of shrimp. I suggest getting this is you're a soup person.   The other dish I got was the orange chicken. It's not normally on the menu but it was presented on the specials board. It was served on top of greens and sliced oranges. Portion size was pretty decent. The chicken was nice and crispy. Great flavoring not too sweet and not too crazy with the orange flavoring. Only downside is that it was caked in batter.",

I am pregnant and there was no place to even sit and wait for that long, and the waiter says I have to wait for somemore time coz there are ppl waiting from 1 hour and they need to get their food first.

When you see pre scalloped shaped carrots that's from a machine.Now for the lunch itself the Drunken Noodles were so so texture but it was over sauced too wet with sauce and too much sodium.  Less is more in this case.  It was sauced like a typical $ chinese food dish which shouldn't be in a Thai dish. All in all $ wise maybe OK but overall I won't be coming back.  So it's basic standard fare.",

    "text": "I was pretty jazzed to see this place open here.  This is so close to my work, and I've been wanting to try the one on Broadway, but the look of the building and the area always just left me a bit scared.  I ordered takeout because I was very busy at work.  I ordered right at 11:00am when they open and the man who answered was very friendly.  He said 20 minutes.  Most places say 20 minutes and then when I show up in 20 minutes, I end up sitting there for another 10-15.  This place not only had it ready at 11:20, but asked me if I was picking up my order as soon as I walked in.  And, as others have stated in their reviews, they do give you bottles of water when you take out.  When I got my food back to work, I was a bit bummed.  The won ton chips and egg roll were soggy because of the condensation occurring in the rapidly cooling to go box.  I would suggest to the restaurant to put those in a separate container from the dish.  Even the disgusting Panda Express puts their rolls in a different baggie.  I got the Spicy Noodle (Drunken Noodle) with a spice level of 5.  It was just OK.  It was not really spicy, but I can handle spice pretty well, so maybe it would be hot to most.  The noodles were kind of odd, they weren't long chewy noodles, they were chunks of noodles.  I will say, the flavors were really good.  I also ordered the fish cakes, not knowing what they were.  Not a fan, maybe it's an acquired taste.  When I had time, I invited a colleague of mine to try it out and actually dine in.  I was hoping that maybe the food would be better eating there.  We couldn't go until noon, which is definitely their lunch rush time, so I can't complain about the long wait.  If you want to avoid the lunch rush, go right when they open at 11am or after 1pm.  It was packed, we got the last table.  As soon as we sat, a waitress came with a couple soups for us.  It was pretty good, a chicken broth with cabbage and some peas and carrots.  We had to wait a bit to give our orders and get our waters, but again, it was super busy.  My guess is that they come from such a small location, they're still getting used to serving so many dine in customers.  The food came and the portion was HUGE.  I ordered the Pad Thai this time.  Again, the noodles were a little lacking.  Kind of mushy.  But, the flavors were good, my colleague agreed.  I ordered 5 spice level again and it still wasn't spicy for me.  Just enough to give me a little runny nose, if that is helpful for you heat lovers out there.  All in all, this is a good restaurant.  Friendly staff, good food and good lunch special prices.  There is another place in the area that has 5 star food, but the service is VERY slow and it's a lot further away.  So, when I need a Thai fix and don't want to wait or drive too far, I'm going to this place 11am for sure.  I think when they ask for spicy level next time, I'll just say \"10\", that might do the trick.",

I ordered the red curry with tofu, thai hot for a spice level. I ordered it to go. The served me some vegan cabbage soup while I waited free of charge. The whole thing was ready to go in under 10 min. The surroundings were nice, comfortable. Got back to the office and have to say they got the spice right. You know when you start to cough and wheeze you've got the right level of spice. The veggies and tofu were perfect as was the rice. This is a great place for a quick lunch or casual dinner. They have a good selection and are a family owned business which means they are attentive and pleasant. I cant wait to see if their Thai coffee is up to snuff, which could be dangerous given their proximity to work :)",

This is coming from someone who loves very, very spicy food so order with caution. My boyfriend could not handle the level 5. Therefore we always go for the level 4. We also ordered the appetizer fish cakes and mango sticky rice for dessert. Everything was tasty and we even got ice cream included with our meal. Another must try when available is the crab fried rice. The owner is always there at the restaurant and is super friendly. Service was great and will keep coming back even though we have moved far away. Must try. You will become a regular!",

I almost walked out based on this alone because if what they present isn't clean, how does it look where we can't see.  I gave it a shot due to the yelp reviews.  When I ordered my food they were friendly and told me they could make the food to my dietary needs (vegan) and I requested fresh tofu.  All seemed promising.  When my food came out, it had fried tofu. The server told me to try it but if I wanted it the other way they could do that too.  I didn't know what to do at this point, I ordered it as fresh because that is what I like but I didn't want to send the dish back because of it.  The food tasted okay, nothing great. A new server then came up and asked if my food was not made to order.  I told her I requested fresh tofu and she took my plate away promising it to be right.  The second plate I received tasted much better and was made correctly.  I wouldn't say it was the best Thai I have ever had, but it wasn't bad.  Ultimately, the dirty floor, some minor upkeep, and the odd service led to my rating. I feel that all of these things could be improved on.",

My husband had Pineapple Fried Rice and raved that it was the best he had ever eaten.  I enjoy my food hot. However, nine times out of ten I order my food Thai Hot and get American Hot instead. At Charpen I ordered a 5 from the 1-5 scale and found it needed a bit more heat. Our server happily brought me some delicious crushed pepper paste that spiced it up nicely. He also told me I could order hotter (1-10) for next time.   The service and menu prices were a delightful surprise. We will certainly return if we are in the area again.",

    "text": "I was in town for a conference and grabbed some carry out from here since it was nearby and rated well. I was NOT disappointed!!! I ordered red curry with chicken, adding broccoli and carrots, spice level 1. It was PERFECT!  Some of the best & tastiest I've had! My husband got chicken with cashew nuts, & said his was great too!  Also ordered the crispy egg rolls, which for the price (2 rolls for $2) were much larger than I was expecting - could've easily gotten by with just one order!  They were really good too.  Over all, a huge !!",
