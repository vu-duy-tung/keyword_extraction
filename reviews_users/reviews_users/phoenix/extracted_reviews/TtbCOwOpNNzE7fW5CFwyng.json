HOWEVER, someone there is engaged in credit card fraud and identity theft. My information was ripped off and sold to a third party harvester that tried to drain all the funds in my account all within the time it took to drive thru and order breakfast. But, fortunately for me I check my activity daily.   I can't say I won't ever go back again, because these are the acts of an individual one would assume. But I would highly advise anyone who goes there to be a cash paying customer from now on. I know I will be.",

We each ordered what we wanted and the cashier was either learning what to do or completely forgot what she was doing because it took us forever to cash out....  Now to the important part the donuts.... I got the chocolate glazed and was told I needed to try the buttermilk so I got both. The chocolate glazed was delicious and it just melted in your mouth, but the buttermilk one was so thick that it was hard to eat and I could not even finish it and I did not think it was that good to be honest.  Overall a great place for donuts!",

    "text": "My guilty pleasure. Yes, donuts are absolutely horrible for you (nothing but sugar and fat) but they taste sooooo good (nom). Forget the Krispy Krap, their glaze is so sugary it gives me a toothache/headache and they are overrated in flavor.  Bosa delivers with flavor and a small (regional) chain charm.  I go for the traditional twists, so soft and fun to pull apart in fluffy pieces. But they have a number of great traditional and \"fancy\" jelly, sprinkle, chunky donuts.  Bonus, drinks with Boba!  I'm not big on coffee, but it tasted ok to me.  Warm and not burnt tasting.  Of course, I've been ruined by S'bux so take it with a grain of salt.   This location is in a nice transitional area on edge of Arcadia.  I really appreciate the drive-thru for quick fixes.  But if you have the time, it is nice to go in an see the whole selection in the display windows. I've never had an issue with speed or service, though i've visited at different hours.",

Excellent donut quality. They have all the variety you would hope for and taste so fresh. They also serve coffee and milk and even boba. AND they have a drive through. UPDATE: They could be even better if they had real espresso drinks. Found out today while trying to order a \"cappuccino\", which comes from a machine and cannot come without sweetener and a fake flavor. Why is it so hard to find a place with good baked goods AND good coffee/espresso?",

Whether it's a freshly prepared delicious donut, a super tasty lunch time sandwich (they have ham and tuna- and you can get it on croissant, bagel, or English muffin), or a breakfast sandwich (which by the way are BOMB!), Bosa delivers. They have the richest and creamiest smoothies, they even have Taro and Boba which is awesome too! I'm an overall fan and can come any time of day too, which is cool because they're open 24hours.",

I'm not sure why some reviewers have said that donuts here are extra pricey, as they're between about 99 cents and $1.50 per donut, comparable to most donut shops, unless you're buying your donuts from the grocery store or something.  I can't speak as to the drive-through system that everyone hates so much, because we always go inside (tip: with Bosa, always go inside if you care about your order being correct!!), but we've never had problems with order accuracy. The interior isn't fancy, but the donuts are good and I've never experienced too long of a wait. We've had cake donuts, maple bars, apple fritters, bear claws, and old-fashioned donuts (the chocolate-dipped ones are so good!) here.  Don't expect much of the staff - they're never friendly, and they won't answer questions with anything more than the bare minimum. The donuts make up for the service, for us.",

On this particular visit,  I decide to eat my donut while I'm waiting for the bobas I ordered for my family. There's a hair in the donut so long,  I can floss my teeth.  Now,  I can usually over look the poor service I always receive when I go in the afternoon because the service in the morning is great,  but after she handed over my bobas and knocked it all over my car, not once but twice, I won't be returning.

The lady who helped me was sweet, fast and friendly. I felt like a kid again seeing pink donut boxes in the back! Their donuts are the real deal! Soft, fluffy and melts in your mouth. The price was decent too about 80 cents per donut. My total came out to around $2.50 for three donuts. Not too bad.

I also got a mocha cappuccino. I was really  disappointed though, I thought it would be a real cappuccino, but it was just a flavored machine. It still tasted decent though.

The whole time the cashier was just staring at us with a blank stare as we placed our order, then had to have us repeat it a couple of times because he clearly wasn't paying attention. Then come to find out he charged us for two smoothies instead of the Thai iced tea which is cheaper. He then said it was ok as if overcharging us was doing us any favors. My mango smoothie tasted like mango flavored ice chunks. There was nothing smooth about it at all. The boba was the worst part. I've had boba more times than I can count and it's not ever supposed to be hard and crunchy. After two sips I tossed the \"smoothie\" and left. My BF's tea was good but he had to spit out the boba as he drank, which hit the floor like hard pellets. This place may be good for donuts, but that's about it. I will not be returning.",

I figured out I had made a mistake when I ended up at the window paying 5 bucks for a taro boba....with whipped cream that I wasn't given an option to decline (I hate whipped cream on drinks.) When I was completely caught off guard by the receipt handed to me, because the attended didn't let me know the cost before charging me and I stupidly had not realized that I hadn't followed their menu since everything was close enough to be mistaken for another price or item on there. I spoke up and asked about it, the attendant was rude about it. The boba was cooked well, however not enough of a pull for me to pay more and have to deal with rude service/chaotic menu. Eh.

But, recently we discovered the croissants. Hot hammy, cheesey.... Amazing. Even the regular ones are so flaky and moist and delicious. Also, the donut holes are another delicious (and cheap) choice. I keep meaning to try their boba drinks, but I always happen to already have a cup of coffee in hand when we stop in here.",

I have always had a passion about donuts. Even when I was at my peak health, there was room for donuts.  Bosa just does it right, the Cinnamon Crumb is clearly the best donut, but even the cake donuts rock. (Please dont' make me regret recommending this flavor, leave one for me from time to time, friends)  Coffee is usually quality, and black as night. The Dunkin's in the area seem to have a real problem with consistency, but not the case w/ Bosa  I too look forward to trying their take on Boba Tea, but it's gonna be hard to beat The Street.  Take it from a guy who could put away a dozen donuts, but has the will to eat just one at a sitting... Why waste your calories on crappy cakes, candies, etc, Donuts are the way to go.",

    "text": "Finally, central Phoenix gets a BoSa Donuts! Perfectly housed in the former Carvel Ice Cream building in the Thai Lahna strip center, walking into the space is like being transported to a sanitized version of your favorite 24-hour SoCal fried dough joint (and much more cheery than Rainbow on McDowell, which has seen better days). On this maiden pre-work run, I stuck with a maple long john and coffee. The dough was tender, with no off flavors from old fry oil or chewiness from sitting around, and the icing had a nice sugary snap. The coffee was standard-I am eager to try the chai milk tea with boba pearls on my next visit.  The only small suggestion I would make to the owner is provide a little more seating and turn up the AC ever so slightly. I know donut shops are usually a tad toastier than other eating establishments, but if you are going to offer free Wi-Fi and stay open until 10, it will definitely help build a visible eat-in clientele at this new location.",

    "text": "One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.  So - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.  The guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.  We went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.  Next stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)  Results -       Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.           ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~      Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.           ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~      Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.           ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.  So, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.  I can't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be!",

Their answer was basically.. \"we are too busy to make it\".   So it's not that they don't have it it.  It's that they don't want to make it.  Why have it on the MENU if you don't want to make it? I always also get confused because they always tell you.  \"We only make those upon request\".  Ok? So I am here requesting them...  Yet they still don't want to make them or state they don't have time. Maybe they should post when and what time you can get anything on their menu.  They constantly change their mind on what they do have and what they don't.",

When I was visiting Phoenix and passed by Bosa Donuts and saw a line OUT THE DOOR, I immediately made a U-turn. My road trip foodie philosophy has always been \"if you see a line, get in it.\"   As a long time donut fan (I wasn't fat for the majority of my life for no reason), I was psyched to try these donuts. When it was finally my turn, the scowling hipster behind the counter helped me select 3: an original glazed, a Boston cream and an apple fritter. She was not too pleased that I declined her upsell to half a dozen so she scowled even more.  The standout in the bunch was the original glazed. It was soft and not too sweet. The Boston cream was fine (not worth eating) and the apple fritter was not my cup of tea. It was way too dense and way too sweet. The only thing that was completely devoured was the original glazed. I've had some fantastic donuts in the world (Lee's Donuts in Vancouver and Randy's Donuts in Los Angeles being my two favorites) and while Bosa's are pretty good, they wouldn't make my top 10 greatest donuts list. Worth a stop if you're in Phoenix but I don't see what the crazy fuss is about. Sorry.",

The cashier was also very nice. He answered any questions I had about fillings, toppings, etc. and was very patient while I was choosing (it's so hard to make up my mind sometimes!). They may not be \"artisanal\" doughnuts, but they are my favourite. Throughout the day, I could not help but eat a second one.

We were not greeted, we sat at the counter waiting for them to finish their conversation. Tried asking some questions to have one lady give us the quickest and easiest answer that we do not feel was actually True, while the other employee seemed like she was going to disagree with her but maybe it was her manager so she just shut up. It was very confusing and we couldn't even just get a straight answer, even after saying \"oh, I wasn't paying attention\" when I called her out on her obvious lie.   We pointed out which donuts we would like clearly and using their names and she still gave us one of the wrong ones.   And then you pay and their system has the nerve to ask you to leave a tip. Efffff that.   The place is dirty. Try looking up, the vents and lights are covered in dust that either is about to or already is...falling into your food. I don't even want to look behind the counter.   We needed to use the restroom but hell no.   I know this place is an institution for many locals, but I think it's gone to their heads.",

I used to eat an entire box of crispy creme when it first came out... its weird I just love donuts more than any other sweets out there and I try very hard not to eat them regularly since I can't stop once I start haha. Ok so on my way home, I stopped by and grabbed a few. They had a good selection considering it was 6pm on a Tuesday. I started off w the mini donut holes and I asked for 4 and the girl seemed surprised that I only wanted 4 and asked \"thats all?\" Poor girl has no clue I have no self control when it comes to donuts! Then I got the toasted coconut and rainbow sprinkles. She was right, I should have ordered more of the mini donut holes!! They were so fluffy with the perfect amount of texture and sweetness. Then I literally just took a bite of the rainbow sprinkles and the coconut since I want to save these for tomorrow morning!! Absolutely delicious!! Did I mention for everything I paid under $2.70??? So 4 stars for being delicious and inexpensive!!! I only docked a point cuz they didn't have my maple syrup glazed eclairs...",

The tea was good and the boba was cooked well and proportioned (no one likes to be skimped on boba) Even though I came for tea I couldn't help but notice the eye candy of donuts galore.

We had ordered 3 donuts to eat while there, then ordered another half dozen to take home. As I paid for the last 6 one of the workers began talking negatively about black people and used racist language in front of me and my children. The worker was not able to get the right order from a customer at the window. Instead of blaming the wind or bad tech, she blamed the woman's race - saying this is what it is like with Black people.  She didn't say it once.  Note even twice.  She said it THREE times to make sure I heard it. I told her to watch her language and to not be so hateful, especially in front of my children. Other customers walked in and I made sure they understood what was happening. The worker apologized and I said \"don't apologize, live differently.\"  Bosa, so sorry, but I will NEVER be back to this location, at least, and maybe the entire franchise.",

Nevermind the fact that I decided to get donuts after my best friend's birthday drinking binge and after ordering pizza... Donuts, especially from Bosa are super yummy!   The selection wasn't that extensive when I walked in (I mean, how could it be when I'm sure the donuts sell like hotcakes, and I walked in after 10pm, lol), but still had a few that caught my eye and made my mouth water. Ended up buying a dozen -- 'cause sharing is caring! (Ok, fine, I didn't share. I just went on a donut-eating-binge.)  The donuts at Bosa are super moist and tasty! Not too sweet, where you feel like your teeth are forming cavities as you eat the donut, but yet sweet enough to satisfy your sweet-tooth. I would highly recommend Bosa donuts to anyone -- day or night. I wish they were closer to me so I could indulge more often... although maybe it's a good thing they're not. haha.",

I usually get their glazed donut, donut holes, or their beagle ham & cheese sandwich. I have never been disappointed with the food I have received.   The only thing I do have a problem with is their customer service. I can only recall one time that I have gone and the employee was nice. She was smiling and making jokes as she rung me up. Unfortunately that was the only time I ever saw her.  Every other time I've been here, the staff is unnecessarily rude.If they were super busy and understaffed then I could understand why they might be a little grouchy, but that has never been the case.   The donuts are not what has me coming back and the HORRIBLE customer service hasn't pushed me away only because Bosa is really close to where I live, they're open 24/7, and they're cheap. The convince of this location outweighs everything I don't like about them.",

My favorites are the buttermilk bars, chocolate cake, and old fashioned chocolate, but they are all good. They also have sandwiches, teas, coffees and other goodies, but I have never bothered with anything beside the scrumptious donuts. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because their staff is incredibly unfriendly and act as if you are a burden.

Service: Pretty consistent between stores, staff is friendly and helpful. Nothing stands out here, but it's a pleasant experience every time. 4/5.  Food: I love the #6 turkey on croissant sandwich. Thai Tea with or without boba is excellent. But honestly, it's all about the donuts. They are all good, but the buttermilk is to die for. 5/5.

They seem to get a lot of orders from drive-thru customers, as all 3-4 employees were eagerly talking through headsets and preparing orders while I patiently waited at the counter for someone to notice me. When a woman finally asked if I had been helped (umm, no m'aam you're the first person to speak to me in the 5 minutes I've been standing here looking at you), I ordered a half-dozen donuts ($5+) and went on my merry way. While Chocolate Frosted with Sprinkles will always be my first choice in doughnuts, I must say that the toasted Coconut doughnut was my favorite from here!   All in all, Glazed was fine (though lacking appearance points after getting all smooshed up while being put into the box), Cinnamon was good, they were out of Lemon-filled so I defaulted to Raspberry-filled which was better than I expected it to be, and I didn't care for the Maple Bar. I'm not dying to come back, as there are plenty of other doughnut shops I'd rather try instead, but if I were to find myself here again I'd definitely get more Coconut doughnuts.",

I never thought I would be on here in my life but their rude staff is what finally pushed me to grab a busniess card last time I went and recover my forgotten Yelp password.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the food nor any drinks they sell. Everything tastes great.  The problem is their employee/s. I'm talking about the person over the counter that greets you and takes your money.  I only go at night with my friends and every time we order, the employee gives off this vibe almost like we are a bother just standing there ordering our usual boba drinks and occasionally  donuts, the look on her face confirms that awkward feel too. The faces she makes as we're ordering is almost like she's thinking \"get the fuck out of here\" \"why are you coming into the store\". that type of thing. For the most part, my friends and I try to ignore it and make our orders quick. The thing is that it happens every single time we go and there is no other place like this in our side of town. I just wish that somebody that really needed a job and showed pride in his/ her workplace took this person's place.",

What can't they do!\" Homer Simpson  Now that we got the Homer Simpson quotes out of the way, seriously; this place can turn you into HOMER SIMPSON!  When my buddy was telling me how he was addicted to this donut & I had to just try them! My reaction was \"OK Homer they are just donuts!\" & \"You can't do much better than Krispy Kreme in Phoenix!\"   Plus;  \"Donuts? I told you I don't like ethnic food!\" (Montgomery Burns)  He literally made me get in the car and drove to this place!  The look of disappointment just covered his face when the gal announced; They were out of the one particular one he had his mind set on! So a week later he made it a point that we go back to this place... Again middle of the afternoon and they were out of the \"Chocolate Wheeler!\" So the following week mid morning we went by this place. Again they were out!  By this point I'm thinking maybe the fact these suckers are like 85cents maybe they are good and they make a dozen or two & sell out!  The next day, after finishing a 3 set Tennis Match, in the parking lot in front of the Tennis courts I ask him so where are you going for breakfast!  He just smiles reaches into the back of his SUV and pulls out a pink cake box, and opens the box!   There are a dozen of these bad boys in the box!  \"Aye Carumba!\" (Bart Simpson)  So with a \"REALLY! you bought a whole \"F\"ing dozen look on my face\" I reach in and pull one of these Famous Wheelers out! I examine it visually; it looks no more special than any other donut!   So as I sink my teeth into it I have to say;  \"OMG!\" & I mean \"OH MY GOD!\"  I think I just had a FOODGASM! (yes it's a real word, you can Google it!)  And I'm sporting wood just thinking about that moment!!!  I KNOW, I know, you must be thinking this guy must think he is writing \"DEAR PENTHOUSE...!\" But you know how when you fall in love with that one girl that pales all other relationships before & after her?  Well to quote another fictional character this donut is \"Simply Scrumdiddlyumptious!\"   To find out what this means I guess you have to get to Bosa Donuts before me & all the other \"Homers\" & spend 85cents!)  In comparison Krispy Kreme pales to Bosa Donuts!   WARNING: You can't have just one!",

The buttermilk donut was very unique, I would recommend it. The old fashioned donuts are also very good, although a little dry. In the end, my favorite is always the chocolate sprinkle donut!  They are open 24 hours (drive-thru) so it is kind of hit and miss with freshness- I think they make new batches as needed, so some donuts on display are fresh while others are not. The inside part is open until 10 pm (even on sundays!) so this is a good random late night escapade.",

They have everything from bear claws to cinnamon buns, and all the donuts are always fresh, I have never gotten 'old' donuts that taste like they have been on the shelf to long.

    "text": "Let me start off my saying I'm a long time customer and up until this morning would recommend Bosa to everyone. With that being said what I witnessed this morning was disturbing on so many levels. As I stood in line this morning waiting to place my order it appeared that the man in front of me was a bit impatient as they were busy as they are most weekday mornings. I over heard a brief verbal exchange between the man and the employee behind the counter and couldn't believe what I heard. The employee informed the customer that he could go behind the counter and help himself to whatever doughnuts he wanted. At that point the man proceeded to go behind the counter, grabbed a box, and with out reservation began reaching into the case grabbing doughnuts to fill his box. The employees didn't stop him as if it were a normal practice. The man didn't wash his hands and obviously hadn't been trained on safe food handling procedures. He then came from behind the line with the box of doughnuts and went to pay. Needless to say, myself, along with the other customers standing in line were appalled by what had just transpired. With the laundry list of health code violations that I had just witnessed being broken I made a conscious decision to remove myself from the establishment without ordering and will NEVER patron this business again. I have always been a huge proponent in support of local business but can say without hesitation that Bosa Doughnuts will never see my business again.",

    "text": "So... My boyfriend and I found this place as one of the few (if not only) donut spots in Phoenix that's open 24/7. After he had a craving for donuts at 1AM, it had good reviews, and I saw on yelp that they served boba there, we decided to give it a go. When we got there, he first ordered a boba for me and began his dozen donuts order. The donuts he wanted (namely chocolate... Simple to make you would think) was not available at 1AM. He then asked for another type of donut (Boston cream)... Not available. Only ones they said they had at that time of night was glazed, raspberry filled, and lemon filled. He declined the donuts altogether because he was frustreated with continually getting \"sorry, we don't have that\".  I gave this place a one star on his behalf and because I had my boba drink and it was descent, however, nowhere near the best I've tasted. I like my boba squishy and not too rough to chew. I tried boba at this one Viet restaraunt that was better but that's another yelp review in the making.  Overall, case and point: we may have been better off going there earlier in the day and their selection seems to be EXTREMELY limited after typical business hours. If your business is said to be open 24 hours AND you're one of the only open available donut shops in the area that never close, PLEASE have a majority of your donut selection available around the clock. Thank you for reading this rant.",

    "text": "These donuts are good, but was not sure they live up to the hype for me. We recently moved to Arcadia and I was psyched to try Phoenix's \"best\" donuts. We lived in Central Phoenix prior and frequented Rainbo donuts at16th St/McDowell... which sets the bar pretty high to begin with.  I didn't really feel that Bosa was superior to Rainbo. My first visit was especially disappointing because I ordered a crumb donut which are so delicious and my favorite when done right. However, when I got back to my house they had given me those glazed donuts with crumb coating on top. Learned my lesson that you apparently have to say \"crumb cake\" here.   Anyway, they are fresh and good... but not amazed.",

The donuts are very soft and fresh. I found them a bit too sweet but my husband seemed to enjoy the sweetness. I still think this place is one of the best donuts places in Phoenix.   Good variety of donuts and they also have croissant and bagel sandwiches and boba drinks, which is very similar to Rainbow Donuts on McDowell. This place is bigger with more variety.   Customers kept coming while we were there and a few customers were waiting all the time as only one lady was handling all the customers. Not that I complain about that but I felt sorry for her. She was handling all the customers inside and at the drive thru. But she was handling them very well and with a very polite manner saying \"thank you for waiting\" to every customer. She was pretty quick to prepare our order too.   The price is also quite reasonable. I forgot the exact prices but a donut was around $.75 and  sandwich was $3.49 each if I remember correctly.",

So, in terms of taste, Bosa donuts are as unhealthy and delicious as they can get. They have pretty decent flavors as well and it's really cheap. For two donuts, we usually pay 1.90. However, I'm pretty big on customer service and the customer service just isn't there. A lot of times it seems like they don't want to be working or as if they don't want to make any business.

The donuts were fresh, actually some of the softest and moistest I've had. And considering I came in at 8am on a Saturday, service was very fast and efficient, even if my particular clerk was putting off the \"I'd rather be somewhere else vibe\". It's par for the course for a donut shop.  The donuts were solid. I tried a strawberry glazed that was the perfect amount of sweet, tasting enough like strawberry to satisfy my craving. The texture was dense and soft.  It was a good donut, even if I'd prefer a tiny bit more fluffiness in my bite. I'd get it again.  The old fashioned chocolate was also very dense and soft. Again, I was hoping for a more airy texture than I got. The flavor was good, it actually tasted like chocolate. Whatever they're doing to their frosting they need to keep up because it's very flavorful and delicate.  Solid place. I'll be back",

The donuts are delicious, they have locations all over the valley, and the one by my house is open 24 hours a day. I'll never buy donuts at the grocery store or Dunkin again as long as Bosa exists.  Be forewarned, this isn't a place you go for a fancy donut experience, this is where you go to pick up a dozen delicious donuts to bring to work. The interior is very basic but the display case is always full of donuts (even in the evening) and they're $1 each when you buy them individually. My favorites are the maple bar and their buttermilk donut (which is apparently on some list of best donuts in America).   The coffee is nothing to write home about but they have a large menu of smoothies and other drinks that I've been meaning to try.  I'm always happy to support a locally owned company!",

Seems a little unorganized as far as employees trying to do too much at one time. Yes I get it, Sunday's are extremely busy. But don't try to multitask. Do order by order. Many customers sat around waiting to even pay. Personally, I wouldnt care if I was waiting in line for a little longer. So I'm not sure what the rush was trying to get people out of the line. Place was dirty. I could see change and cash just sitting out on one of the stainless steel tables. I'm assuming food is prepared on these tables. I'm going to assume that they also wipe these down after having change on it, one of the dirtiest things ever. Employees didn't really seem to care that they were messing up. Employee on drive thru seemed to be the only person who cared. I am giving this business my money. My money is paying for these employees checks. They should at the least apologize for the wait, for the order mess up, etc. I have worked in the restaurant industry and totally get it. My order was some donuts, which were cold, and two croissants with ham and cheese. I guess they ran out of the prefilled croissants so they gave me a lunch croissant which was toasted but with cold ham and cheese. No problem with them running out but come on. If I wanted cold ham and cheese, I couldve made this at home. Overall, I love this place but the downfall of this location is organization, and customer service.",

The lady prepared the Boba with whip cream on top and a healthy portion of Boba balls at the bottom. I've never had whip cream in a Boba before, but boy was it tasty. A large Taro Boba came out to about $6. 40 which is pretty expensive, IMO. The expensive price of the Boba is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars.",

I ordered a Cappucino but I don't know if there was a misunderstanding at the speakerbox but I ended up with some blended ice drink. It tasted a little ''powdery''.  The donut I ordered was a cinnamon sugar one. It was so soft and delicious. (I felt a little sick afterwards but again, I'm not a big donut person.) From the menu it looked like they have at least 12-15 donut options.  Definitely will come back for donuts but I'll probably stick to Starbucks for my cappuccino.",

Either that or they have no taste (hoping the prior; don't wanna seem too pretentious).  Anyway, the people who claimed these doughnuts are a step above Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts are wrong. They aren't a step below, it's just that they almost taste *just* like Krispy Kreme doughnuts. I had a chocolate-filled glazed, a much-recommended (on here) buttermilk, and a chocolate iced chocolate cake doughnut.   The verdict: The chocolate cream-filled was more of a chocolate jelly than chocolate cream. After a bite, it was clear for the trash bin. The other two were not so bad, but seriously tasted just like Krispy Kreme; the \"buttermilk\" is just a knock-off of KK's sour cream doughnut.  Anyway, pretty disappointed given the reviews here. I suppose I've never liked doughnuts, for as one reviewer put it they have a \"fast food feel\" after eating them from Dunkin' or KK; unfortunately, as copycats these have that same feeling.",

Located in a strip mall with ample parking spaces, Bosa is open nearly 24 hours a day. A group of us wandered in here at 9 in the evening on a Saturday, craving sugar after a long day of bar hopping. We were immediately greeted by a friendly proprietor behind the counter, and were pleased to find a deserted store in which to munch.   They have a crazy selection, too. I nearly picked a maple bar, but ended up settling on my apple treat. I did take a bite of bae's maple bar though, and it was fantastic. These donuts are fresh and pillowy, melt-in-the-mouth good. Stupid good even.   The donut I'm raving about was stuffed full of fresh and flavorful apple pie filling. This donut rivalled even the famous Rainbow Orchard apple cider donut. I'm not kidding, Apple Hill Fans. I am so stopping here the next time I visit my Phoenix bestie. I've got my eye on the Boston Cream. Bosa is a MUST.  Ps they have food food and boba drinks too!",

Old and busted building that it seems the owner(s) don't want to clean up and make look modern.  More important is that the drive-thru microphone/speaker needs to go.  I'm a loud guy and the person taking my order has difficulty hearing me almost every time I go.  I certainly have difficulty making out what the order taker is saying due to not only her accent but also the crackle and static of that antiquated speaker from 1949. (Please don't think I'm saying that there is anything wrong with the order takers accent).  Again, the donuts are on point, and the only reason to ever go to Dunkin Donuts is if there is something preventing your tastebuds from noticing the vast difference in freshness, tase and overall superior quality.    3 stars for Meh customer service and unwillingness to upgrade necessary business equipment.  Come on Bosa.  You can improve in these two areas.",

But having enough donuts and being courteous to customers is absolutely something they can control.  They had essentially none of the normal donuts left to pick from once I waited in line for 10 minutes. I was then treated with very poor customer service and they were frankly rude. After I reluctantly chose donuts that I didn't even want, I was treated with more poor service at the register. I was also told that one donut was free, but I didn't even get that. At this point in my frustrating experience though, I was not going to raise a complaint over a free donut.  Unfortunately, this experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth for this location.",

I didn't really care for the jalapeno-added variety, but it's not your fault. I guess I'm just not as much of a jalapeno lover as I thought I was. But the item on your menu that brings me nothing but unadulterated bliss is your lemon filled donut. So soft and yielding, I just can't help myself when I'm around them. Powdered sugar on my face, in my hair, all over my hands and clothes...it feels just as obscene as it sounds, and I want to continue this dirty romance for many, many years to come. I'm sure I will try your other options, the tryst I had with your sinful apple fritter was a one (maybe two-four) time thing. But I'll always come back for a sweet surrender to your doughy lemon lumps. *blush*",

Seeing that it was late at night and needing a break from studying for finals, I drove over and ordered a donut and tea and read for fun (yes despite school I can still manage to do that) there for half an hour. The place looks really neat. It's small, but not cramped, it's definitely cozy. The lady working there that night was funny, nice, and cool in a way that you'll just have to see for yourself perhaps if you decide to go then. It was really tranquil there and I definitely look forward to going back.",

The good news is they are open 24/7 so I am able to get my boba smoothie or tea fix whenever I want. I have tried their mango and watermelon and both were really good. My boyfriend has ordered the banana strawberry and the melon so far and he was also pleased with both of the flavors he chose. I also ordered my brother a ham and cheese bagel sandwich and he said it tasted amazing. I have only visited this location twice and late at night and there is a wait time which I don't mind because they take the time to make the drinks/food great quality.

I want the dough to taste good as well as the frosting or glaze i get on it. I was expecting to have the best donuts and was let down a little. The donuts are good, but the dough doesnt really have flavor it just taste like bland bread? Dont get me wrong this is my 3rd time trying them and each time the donuts were a bit off, so i did get them a few chances. I do like the different kinds of donuts they have. Chocolate and peanuts?! Ugh awesome! One lady told me it was a cherry donut and another told me it was strawberry. Whatever it is, its good! The original glazed is awesome. I like how they glaze it all over like Krispy Kreme. Sadly this did not take me away from Krispy Kreme donuts as i was hoping it would. Good donuts though i guess not good enough to bring Krispy Kreme to shame for me. Ah well.",

I am Mommy of the year when they wander into the kitchen! Why should the sugar high end at 4 in the am,that they think I did not know about! Yee Haaaaah! I know! I Know! But, you are only a kid once. I am totally organic, gluten-free. You just gotta BOSA!  Kind like op -op- op nam- gangnam style!  Bosa will rock your morning socks off!",

She did not have any manners what so ever & as we paid at the drive-thru window she did not say one word to us just handed us our order & receipt. She was way to busy having a loud conversation with someone else inside of the store. HORRIBLE. I am giving five stars because I love Bosa's pastries & have had good visits here in the past, but this one employee was just incredibly rude & had absolutely no customer service.",

I wasn't even bothered that the selection was a bit limited when I went in at 8:40 pm.   Service was very friendly.

    "text": "Bosa Donuts was an extraneous trip to put a small shop to the test of our high hopes.   My fiancee and I love coconut, and we got a half dozen (for something between $5-6) just to get a good idea of the different types. We got one brown cake donut with chocolate frosting and coconut flakes on top. We got one brown cake donut with toasted coconut all over it and maybe other stuff. We got a chocolate bar, a maple bar, and a classic old-fashioned glazed donut. The last one we got was a crumb donut!   The best was DEFINITELY the toasted coconut, followed by a tie between the other coconut and the crumb. The rest were really good versions of classic donuts. The dough is very unique here. It is not artificially soft like Dunkin Donuts. It is very textured and soft and homemade feeling. The donuts taste real, they taste balanced, and they taste awesome! They are not greasy at all, they have a perfect balance between moistness and dry. Also, these donuts have even more value because they are the biggest donuts I have received, at the same price as everywhere else other than the store.  The service wasn't a typical drive-thru, the guy there made me feel like a real person instead of a robot requiring artificial customer service input. In other words, he acted normal, and grateful, in a very simple way. That is how humans should be I feel, especially considering the awkwardness I feel when someone is being fake with me at the counter/drive-thru.  Anyway, these donuts are awesome. They are better than any other donuts I have had. The only place that comes close is a shop in San Diego that was also just as tiny and local called Sunny Donuts. Ironically they both have foreign people working there. Both seemingly Asian or Hawaiian.  My fiance and I were happy to not regret going somewhere new for once! :)  ***I want to add that it was difficult to describe the cake donuts that we wanted because some of them are similar to each other. HOWEVER, the guy on the microphone was very helpful and coherent as to my details, and he got all of them 100% accurate! I was impressed! My fiance talked about maybe giving them letters or numbers for easy reference, but I have faith in that worker understanding over the intercom either way.",

Once at the counter I was asking what flavor a few of the donuts were and the woman seemed bothered that I would ask. Nothing had labels so I didn't have a choice. I am guessing her lack of communication was more of a language barrier, however, her attitude wasn't needed. I probably would have purchased a dozen but I walked out with one mediocre donut. I won't be back and definitely won't recommend either. I rather give my business to someplace who actually cares about their customers.",

My preference is a good cream filled long john (i'm talking vanilla cream, not custard)  Here at Bosa, well they started out by noting that when they fill long johns they only fill them with custard (yech) - I had asked for a vanilla filled.    After more looking I noticed some standard rounds that were filled with cream (WTF lady, I said I would like cream filled and you didn't think to mention you had one?)  So I got the cream filled and I must say it was the oddest vanilla cream filled doughnut i've ever tasted. I do not know what was in that donut but I can tell you it wasn't vanilla cream.  Just some weird sugary sweet white substance.  The glazed donuts were awesome, and the apple fritter thing was REALLY good as well.  Yet this place is definitely solidly meh-ok and no where near awesome.",

Some drive thru experiences have been bland where they don't even let me know the total at the end so I'm not sure whether to drive forward or wait, and then they give me a tone \"pull up to the window\" after sitting there.

That said, especially during late night periods, there are times where you walk in and their batches are more dried out. So sometimes it can be a hit or miss. That's why I walk in so that I can better tell what's fresh and what isn't. However, compared to so many other donut spots in the valley, they still on average do a better job.",

It's also my go-to breakfast spot after hiking nearby Piestewa Peak. The donuts are always fresh and deliver that Bosa quality you can expect at any of their locations across the valley. My personal favs are the buttermilk and Bavarian cream. At $0.87 per donut you seriously can't go wrong with this place!  There also seems to be a drive thru at this location as I've seen the window for it, although I'm not entirely sure it's operational as I've yet to see a car to through it. Maybe I'm just coming on off hours.  Finally, as is the case with other Bosas, they are open 24/7. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night cravings! :P",

I normally do not eat donuts, but recently, I just had this craving.  This past weekend, my first time ever, I visited Bosa to pick up a dozen for a group event.  The shop is small and not luxorious, but who cares?  I wasn't planning on sitting down, reading a book, and people watch.  Ugh - have you ever really watched people eat donuts?  It's not a pretty sight.  It's like a challenge - to get that \"almost the size of your face\" donut in your mouth.  You stop for one moment to get your mouth ready and you open up.  Lips start to hurt and chap up and once you get it in there, you have this face like you accomplished something \"bigger than life\"  and after, you have frosting all over your lips and upper lip!    Well, at least that's what I think people are thinking when they eat their donut because quite honestly, they look like their thinking that.    I think that when I'm eating my donut!  Don't judge. Just don't watch me.",

No wonder this local chain has about 20+ locations and some if not all have a drive-up window that's open 24hrs!!! Now these aren't the upscale fancy Voodoo style donuts that cost $5-10 each, these guys make the standard everyday donuts but make it better than anyone! Went to the store in Gilbert and they make 2-sizes: a .99 regular one and a mammoth sized one that's only .39 more!!!

They're great even if they're a day old. Also, everybody says the apple fritter is the bomb. I don't know about that, but the bear claw is filled with baked apples and I have never had a better donut, EVER, than that! Their cinnamon swirls are also out of this world. Yum!",

    "text": "24 hours is a joke at this location and the service is just as bad. They should change their name to \"We are out\". It really does not matter that we got a late night donut craving and headed about 25 miles out of our way late at night to fill that craving...what matters is getting our hearts set on certain flavors and more than 1/2 of the time we are barked at \"We are out\". Really? 24 hours and you are out of everything? Not even as much as an \"I am sorry, but we are out\" no just \"we are out\". Maybe keep the lobby open 24 hours so that when you are out of EVERYTHING customers can actually SEE that you are out and not waste their time hearing \"no\" that's a bad word in customer service, yes sometimes it is not possible to always say yes, but NO should not be the primary word in a business priding itself to be 24 hours. Can you imagine going to Wendys late at night and ordering a burger and being told \"We have no more meat in stock\"....well then what is the point of being 24 hours? I guess just to pay some pissed off cashier to do nothing, but get an attitude with her customers because they are sick of being told no.  Onto the donuts, they were very good and flaky! I think my fave one was the chocolate with sprinkles. The raspberry one was OK at best....The filling was what I did not care for at all, but the actual donut was good! My husband liked the glazed the best. We both went there with our hearts set on a certain flavor and of course both left without those since this 24 hour location decided that stocking up was not a crucial part of being a good 24 hour location. I guess it is good that what we did get we, for the most part, liked enough to say we would go back......but maybe to another location if we were in the area.",

The Cesar salads had to be 80 degrees and lacked any real spice, 2 croutons.  My Wifes veal Marsala was tough, the sauce was lacking, the green beans were mush. My veal parameasan was good but it had an inch of sauce on top, the alfredo was ok.  I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good, the teramasu was good. For $240 for four people it wasnt worth it, subtract $78 for wine it was still high.   Overall the restaurant was average not at Marcellinos five star rating by any means.",
