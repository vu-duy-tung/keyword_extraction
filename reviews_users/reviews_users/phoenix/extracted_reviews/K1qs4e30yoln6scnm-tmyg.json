These had to be some of the best wings I have ever had.  The fries are solid with some of their dipping sauces too.  Last but not least the honey biscuits are dangerous but so damn good.   I haven't Kool-Aid in years.  Talk about bring back some memories!   Over all it is a solid spot and you can't go wrong with it.   The owner Mike is a real cool and humble guy.  You can't go wrong supporting a business with owners like that.    I will be back many more times!",

The seasoning on these have really great flavor. Always love the food and the staff is really friendly. We do come in with a good sized group and have had some ordering issues in the past, but the staff is really good at correcting their mistakes and usually give us some fries for the table or even some of their biscuits (which are really good doughnut type desert with honey and powdered sugar). They also have $0.65 wings on tuesdays which is a good deal. Love the place and would recommend them to anyone.",

We came in on a Sunday afternoon and there was a steady stream of customers.  We were greeted quickly and placed our order.  They let you sample the sauces if you like, which is great if you are undecided.  If you buy wings and a side of fried you get a free drink.  So cool!  We tried the Garlic Parmesan bone-in wings with a sides of fries.  The wings are nice and crispy and BIG!  I would have liked Parmesan on the side to be sprinkled on the wings, but these were still good on their own.  Their fries are incredible.  I don't know if they are hand cut or what, but I ate every fry and the side order is pretty big.  They make their ranch in house and it was so good.  We also tried their biscuits covered in honey and topped with cinnamon and sugar.  Yummy treat to finish the meal!  They have three different kinds of kool-aid and sodas to drink.  This is a great place.  Definitely worth a return visit to try the other flavors!",

I found myself in Phoenix tonight and was craving wings and of course my first thought was making the hike to ATL in Chandler. Much to my surprise there was a location in Phoenix! As soon as I walked in the new location struck me as clean, inviting and friendly even despite the fact it was 20 minutes before closing. The manager made me feel welcome immediately and never tried to rush me out when they started to close up. But that only covers the amazing service.  The food was AMAZING, and came out extremely fast. My favorite flavor is the honey habanero, but my boyfriend being a wing purist claims that their cajun hot is the way to go. I have never had a wing at ATL that I didn't like. The fries are perfect, and the honey biscuits are really something (although I usually can't handle eating more than one!)   Overall a perfect rating for this visit. I highly recommend it and urge everyone to give this location some LUV!",

This was my first visit, about 1PM on a weekday. All the tables were dirty. Some still had trash on them, but all of them had grease and crumbs. Smelly like a clogged restroom or back flow from the sewage/drains. Service was a teeny bit slow and had a lot of errors, I figured the guy at the register taking orders was new/ training. He was very nice, but spoke very quietly and with a mumble. No big deal, but I was over charged and so was my friend. Again, no big deal, but maybe repeat people's order back to them before they pay?  The kitchen you could see from the counter was very messy, which can be unappealing seeing tons of empty Franks red hot sauce piled up. Service was a bit inaccurate but friendly. Wish the inside smelled better but tasty wings, crisp fries and house made ranch.",

He ordered the lemon pepper wings, and oh my goodness, I can't even put into words how good they were. Normally I hate lemon pepper wings-- I'm more of a hot wing chick, but these right here... oh yes. The prices are decent, and Wednesday's are 60 cent wing days.

It's a dessert biscuit, syrup & powdered sugar, goes perfect with chicken.  The wings are naked and very crisp and the meat is oh so tender.  No black veins in the chicken like alot of places.  They are good size wings.  The 2 front girls are cute and very friendly and helpful.  They even have a loyalty card program, after 10 stamps, u get a free 10 piece wing.  The inside is small but cozy.  They have a few tables outside.  ALL in all, a great place.  The wings I would have to say are the best I've ever had.

The tables, however, looked like the hadn't been wiped down. The tables were full of crumbs and upon seating ourselves, no one came to wipe it down. So why the 5 stars?.... because the food took my breath away!  Seriously, I still think about these wings. They were cooked perfectly. The outside crispy and the inside perfectly moist. They had a great deal of flavor options, some being quite unique.  The French fries were okay, definitely not as magical as the wings.  Get the biscuits! They're smothered with honey and powdered sugar and are sure to be a nice ending to your meal.  The look aid dispensers were cool, though I can't comment on the flavor as I stuck with water. Give ATL wings a go, you will not be disappointed!",

The only reason why I didn't give them a five star is that sometimes I find the wings to be a little tough and chewy. Otherwise, they're flavors and the size of the wings are worth stopping for.",

I've been a lot of places and have eaten a lot of wings and feel like I know a pretty good wing when I come across one. That being said I really didn't have very high expectations for ATL because it was a referral. Not only was I pleasantly surprised at the taste and texture of the wings but it met my standards for sure. I had the dry rub and my son had BBQ style neither disappointed. Great seasonings, spices and the ATL sauce was not to tangy but savory to say the least. Washed it all down with Grape Kool Aid, that's right I said Kool Aid needless to say that it took me back to the my old neighborhood when Mami cooked rice & beans with a cup of the Grape to help wash it down. ATL is a clean and inviting spot with friendly employees. I approve! Thank you ATL.",

Its a bold statement, cause I consider myself a Chicken wing eating expert!  I've sampled wings from all across the US and this place is one of my favorite ever, let alone in Phoenix.  They do it right.  It's a wing place, everything else is secondary.  This time around I ordered the 36 piece wings, 18 buffalo medium, extra saucy and I had 9 ATL style and 9 honey habanaro.  The wings were big, meaty and very flavorful.  Also ordered some fries ATL style and came with a free drink.  I invited couple of buddies over for the games yesterday and they were thoroughly impressed as well.  It was a little drive for me, but its well worth it.    Best Wings in Phoenix area-  I promise you that!",

We just so happened to be in Phoenix and had a hankering for wings so we Yelped it and soon we were opening the door to ATL Wings.  The greeting was sincere and we proceed to the counter to order.    We opted for the garlic Parmesan wings, great choice.  They comped us a drink just for the heck of it and when we saw the kook-aid dispensers we knew we were in for some serious chow fun. Then to top it off the owner pulls up a chair and we had one of the nicest conversations. He said we gotta try the fries before we go so he has some delivered with a side of honey bbq sauce.  YUM.  Everyone needs to try this combo.  Then, wait, before we go he \"made\" us try the honey biscuits.   OMG.  So hot, so gooey and so dang delicious.   Something like a beignet without the trip to New Orleans.  What a treat.   Top quality, homemade goodness from beginning to end.  I know the secret to the success of this wing shop.  Truly it is All The Love - that my friend will keep you in business for many many years.   Thanks for the experience.",

I had a sleepover/staycation at a Scottsdale resort for my niece and four of her friends and decided I would make some side dishes and pick up wings for dinner.  Went in a few hours before I needed to pick up to place the order and pay for everything.  It was tricky since I was ordering for teenagers plus ordering some for my husband who took the 10 year old nephew for the night.   Sorry, I am horrible with names but they were younger-- (aged mid twenties?)--the girls that helped me we so accommodating when I explained what I needed.  They let me taste sauces and helped me guess what a teenage palate would like.  I got a mix of plain boneless wings with dipping sauces and bone-in medium and honey habanero.  (120 wings total) They were kind enough to package some separately for the boys.  My order was hot and ready at the exact time I asked for it to be ready.  AND my bone-in wings were the perfect extra well done way that I asked for!  Thank you so much.  Everyone loved the wings!",

They USED to be 5 stars - best boneless wings I had ever had - now they just remind me of grocery store frozen chicken nuggets :-(  They're all uniform size/shape now (used to look just like they took a large drumette and pulled the bone out, which was SO good!) and we found that too many of them had bits of gristle in them now.  My husband loves their bone-in wings, but me and the kids really prefer boneless, so unfortunately this is no longer a choice for family dinners out.  Their sauce is great, fries are excellent and the staff is really friendly, but it's HUGE disappointment that we've lost our favorite boneless wing place!!",

There is a moderate amount of room for improvement. When you walk in, you are hit with warm air and a noticeable smell equivalent to sewage but not too bad to make you leave. It was much more noticeable near the fountain drink area. When ordering, you can see the kitchen very clear and it looks like there isn't much help and it's slightly messy/unorganized. I ordered 10pc bone-in medium hot wings with a drink but according to my receipt I was charged for the wings & fries instead of a drink. I wasn't caught up on that, it was just a dollar extra, no need to make a scene. The wings took about 3 minutes to be served and they were hot and fully cooked. As I was dining, more customers began to come in, and a woman had her baby barefoot on the counter while ordering. I wish they politely asked her to keep her child off the counter, as customers such as myself would find that very rude and unsanitary. Other than environmental issues, the food is of great quality and I would definitely return, but maybe for takeout instead.",

Upon arriving there were about 3 people in front of us yet the line moved pretty quickly. There are a ton of wing packages and flavors to choose from so feel free to mix and match! The wings were crispy and the sauce was applied perfectly. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because there were two containers on the bottom shelf of the working space that held wings. The wings were close to the floor and just didn't seem too sanitary.",

    "text": "The King Of Wings.  I really love wings and ATL Wings is the \"King of Wings\". This was my first visit to ATL Wings however, it won't be my last.    ATL Wings has a casual vibe. The restaurant is spacious, colorful, clean and the menu is posted above the register. Diners order at the counter, take a seat, and wait for their meal to be delivered.   The menu at ATL Wings is straight-forward.  You can choose either traditional or boneless wings, select how many you want, and choose a flavor. Simple as that. On the recommendation of a co-worker I ordered  Honey Barbecue sauce and the Garlic Parmesan (dry rub).  Both style wings (sauced and dry)were delicious. However, I preferred the ATL style to the sauced wings. These wings are meaty, tender, crunchy, and coated with a flavorful seasoning. I could have ate wings all day. ATL  wings serves their wings  with your choice of Homemade Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing. However, these wings are so flavorful I didn't need any dressing.   I couldn't let this opportunity pass by without trying the homemade biscuits. So, I ordered a two piece honey biscuit to accompany my wings. All I have to say is, these are no ordinary \"biscuits\". The biscuits at ATL Wings are smothered in honey and powdered sugar and served piping hot. These biscuits are more like sweet flavorful donuts.   I am looking forward my next visit to ATL Wings and more of those biscuits.",

No one else was there during the dinner hour, maybe that should've been a red flag. Nevertheless, I ordered two dozen boneless wings--the kids like boneless, and I have to play along. It was $27. I get two little tins of overbreaded nuggets like you might get as an afterthought from a chain pizza delivery place. Not even 12 in each tin. Nothing even remotely enjoyable about them. Barely passable heavily breaded nuggets in standard sauces. I know I didn't get bone-in like I wanted to but these shouldn't even be sold at a restaurant. Like, don't sell these and call it your food, much less charge $13 a dozen. Staff was cool and welcoming, no complaints there...but $27 for this? Am I missing something? Did I get the wrong order or go to the wrong place? Come on man. Very disappointing. Do not get the boneless wings. Terrible.",

My first visit today was a simple six traditional wing order with \"ATL medium rub.\" See the pic of the menu; there's a LOT of combinations! I wanted as standard of \"hot\" wing order as I could make since this was my first order.  They said that their \"hot\" was typically hotter than other restaurants. I have been going to Lo** Won** for over 20 years. Have to say, ATL is better. Why?  1. Crispier. They say theirs is crispier because the fat layer isn't there. Crispy but meaty and tender.  2. Meatier. Compared to others, these were nice and meaty.   3. Variety. I look forward to trying variations.  Service was very good. I went at noon on a Friday. No problem.  Price? Fair pricing. I had six wings and filled me up! Tuesdays is $0.65 wing day so if you're looking to try them, Tuesdays sound good.  Yup. I'm going back - soon!",

Their menu is strictly wings, you either get your boneless or your regular wing. They have sides available like fries and salad but the menu doesn't get much bigger than that which is why I find ATL the best wing spot. They truly specialize in wings.   Now is the fun part...the flavors for your wings. SO MANY FLAVORS. The best part is...say you order 18 wings, they let you break it down into multiple flavors. That's my go-to with my boyfriend. 18 wings, 3 different flavors. It breaks down nicely. I'm still working my way through their flavor list but I'm a huge fan of the dry rubs. They are just easier to eat without having to go through an entire package of napkins. The ATL rub is an easy choice. It's their signature rub and it's mild and delicious. The medium sauce is spicier than I was expecting so next time I would probably go mild. I could go on and on about the flavors I've tried but I really haven't had one that I've disliked so far so any sauce is a safe bet!! Try them out yourself, you'll quickly be heading back to try more.  I usually get a side salad instead of fries to not make myself feel so bad about eating so many wings and to be honest, their simple side salad is super yummy! They have a house dressing I highly recommend getting. They also have Fruit Punch dispensers next to their soft drink dispenser. You like grape punch? You got it. Not quite sure the exact name of the flavors but they have blue & red too.   Lastly, I love their staff. I usually call in and order over the phone and they are the nicest people every time. Then when I go in to pick up my food, they're always smiling and friendly, striking up conversation and making you feel the love.",

    "text": "My friend from Phoenix swears by this place and I see why. The sauces kinda carry the place. Wings seem to be a bit pricey at almost $1.00 per wing and they don't even offer better deals for buying more. Like, you can buy 6 wings for $5.95 then buy 24 for $23.85. Like, where's the incentive to buy more? You know? Anyway, their sauces were really food. There's no special wing day or anything either like at other establishments. I had the Spicy ATL sauce and the ATL dry rub. They were tasty, but the chicken itself tasted a bit dry as if the wings weren't quite fresh, yet were already cooked then dropped back in the oil to make them fresh. Nonetheless, wings are my weakness and the food was worth what I paid. I'll surely be back to try every single sauce on their menu. We also can't forget the Kool-Aid available as a fountain drink. Amazing to have that sweet drink with the savory flavor of the wings.",

Their wings are perfectly fried so you get that nice crunch with the sauce. If you're in the Phoenix area, be sure to check them out, a super chill place to grab a bite to eat.

    "text": "My first experience with this location was amazing. I tried their Cajun hot traditional wings (extra crispy, extra wet) with fries which were both to die for. However, this review is based on my second visit and the treatment I received from the \"general manager\" Stephanie. I wish I could give 0 stars.   I took 4 of my family members that were from out of town to try this place, I had been raving about it. Upon arriving last Saturday, their systems were down and were only taking cash. No problem, things happen. We went to the Walmart ATM just down the street to pull out cash and my car ended up getting backed into by another car. 45 minutes after dealing with the car accident, we were back at ATL wings.   I went to order my Cajun hot wings and they were out of that sauce. My annoyance started here. I then settled and ordered the regular hot wings extra crispy, extra wet, with fries. My family proceeded to order and when I wanted to go to the bathroom, it was out of order, JUST like it was 2 weeks ago. My whole family wanted Pepsi, the dispenser was only dispensing clear liquid. When we notified the employees, they told us, \"they'd take care of it right away.\" We never got our Pepsi that day because the employees never changed the dispenser.   Now for the food. My wings came out neither extra crispy nor extra wet. The fries tasted like they had been sitting for 10 minutes before served to us, and my sisters order was completely wrong so she had to wait another 20 minutes for her correct order. No employee showed a sense of urgency here OR compassion. We all saw an employee sitting on the counter that contained he ketchup, wipes, and silverware eating wings while we were waiting for my sisters food.   I called to speak to a manager, Stephanie, and explained my experience with that location. When I told her the bathroom was out of order, she told me she had been out of town and couldn't get to it. So when I asked why it had been out of order 2 weeks prior, she proceeded to tell me, \"we get a lot of homeless people coming in and out and using the bathroom and it's hard to keep track when we get so busy and we had someone almost overdose there was blood everywhere it was so horrible.\" I am all for compassion, but that is not my problem. When I asked about the Cajun hot and the empty Pepsi, she told me, \"we hire a lot of young and inexperienced employees so they just don't know sometimes and I'm honestly like the nicest person that works here so I wasn't there the day you came in hahahaha.\" Honestly verbatim. I wish I had the conversation recorded for evidence.   DISCLAIMER: I HATE writing bad reviews on yelp but I tried to reach out to get some answers and Stephanie was full of excuses and started to raise her voice with me when I asked what her excuses had anything to do with running an efficient business. She is very unprofessional and rude. Take your money and your stomach somewhere else.",

We took home the Cajun hot, honey habenero, traditional hot and garlic parmesan. Our favorites were the honey habenero and the Cajun hot. Neither one was very spicy but instead, it had a lot of flavor. We also ordered the bacon cheese fries... Which were legit!  I stopped in for a second time tonight and they did not disappoint. This time, it was not as busy but they were consistent in their communication skills and excellent customer service. The food was delicious.

I loved watching them make the bacon right in front of me and chopping it up to put it on the fries.   Plus, everyone is super sweet. I observed a lady walk in and ask for free food she hinted that she was homeless and looking for a job. Without any hesitation the cashier put together a plate for her and offered to help her find a job the following day. Now that's what I call customer service.",

    "text": "Bomb! These were juicy, cooked til the skin was crisp and delish! The waitress was so helpful and nice as well. Small location, so I hope they intend to grow. Come check them out if you're a wing fan. The ATL style wings are a uniquely flavored dry rub wing. So.dang.good!  We had the dry rub ATL wings... Nice spice (think tasty and savory but no heat) the lemon pepper, which were also great, you could totally get into these and save your fingers from getting saucy. We tried the teriyaki, sweet and savory... So good! The honey chipotle, a sweet heat, the chef special- reminded me of a mild traditional  wing with Italian spices and some parm, medium buffalo (done right... I tasted butter) and my favorite the honey habanero- great sweet heat that is totally edible and won't make you breathe fire.   This place has focused on wings and does them right. Totally worth checking them out and ordering a bunch of flavors. They even make their own dressings in house; they were creamy and well seasoned. You'll also find kool-aid available in a few flavors. I enjoyed the novelty of this but don't like it myself. The kitchen is also in plain view and was obviously clean and well organized. They were frying batches of chicken the whole time I was there. Great job guys!",

    "text": "My boyfriend just moved here from LA and is looking for his go-to wing stop. I think he might of found it. I'm from Phoenix but I had never been to ATL wings. So we walk in,  ask the gentleman at the register about their flavors. He asks a few questions and describes the sauce flavors. As we're deciding what flavors to get, he says hold on I'll let you try them. We thought he was bringing us the sauce to try but instead he brought us different flavor wings to try. I thought that was pretty awesome. As we're trying them more people are walking in (we're now discussing the flavors) before we know it there were 4 people behind us ready to place an order. The employee, instead of rushing us to get to the other customers, continued to talk to us about the sauces. We finally pick our flavors and take a seat. As we're enjoying our wings, the same gentleman comes around the counter to check on us and ask if we liked them. We had the bbq boneless, hot, lemon pepper and Luckys sweet red. They were all delicious and the wings were big which is always a plus. ATL is out of our way, but thanks to the great service and awesome wings we will definitely be back.",

I couldn't decide what seasoning I wanted so I got ATL style (after a sample....mmmmm), medium, citrus Chipolte and honey habanero.  All were delicious.  Also tried the fries, ATL Style, the spice adds a great flavor.  We then finished off the meal with the \"biscuits.\"  They are not traditional biscuits by any means, but oh are they delicious bites of doughy goodness!   If you are ever in the area I definitely recommend stopping in.",

The wings are lightly crispy and then covered in sauce, and there are so many sauces to choose from! The medium is just right with just enough spice that it lets you enjoy a bunch of wings without frying your taste buds. Same with the ATL rub, great taste and just the right amount of heat. Forget the wing chain restaurants, these guys have them beat by far! These are the best wings, bar none!  And the staff, they are great, friendly people! They brought us sauce samples to help us decide and even a couple of wings with rub to try too. They came by the table and chatted up with us and joined in the fun. We had a great time and we will most definitely be back next time we are in town, which is pretty frequent it seems!  Oh, and ya gotta have the biscuits, they are like beignets but different. Just be careful as they can be addicting!",

The service is superior, and thosebig, fat, juicy wings, with the different rubs and seasonings makes the trip all worth it. I never leave there unsatisfied. Don't forget to save some room for one of those delicious bu,ns, with honey, and confection sugar, they'll make you hurt yourself. Wash it all down with a variety of flavors of kool-aid.  Needless to say, this is my Top Pick in the Phoenix, and surroundi,g areas for wing, and they can have a 200 piece order ready to go in minutes, and it will be seasoned to perfection. All The Love Wings... I'm a loyal customer for life. Please open one up near Goodyear.",

I forget what it took the place of but its between Panda Express and Hawaii Ono. They have another location in Chandler as well. It looks clean inside and it looks like they did a remodel from the last spot. The menu is above the register on LCD's. The cashier (Kendall maybe) was real cool from the minute I walked in and staring at the sign. She gave me a breakdown of the sauces had me try a few of the flavors asked all kinda questions to see what I would like. The girl has got passion for wings! Yes they were a little pricey but these wings were meaty!!..Even the non drumsticks pieces looked like they were on steroids! They have a few dry rub options but that doesnt mean just powder on top ...it just means not tossed in sauce like the other ones. I got Habanero Honey and I think there were two levels. I got the hotter one and it was perfect. Since I walked into a spot called ATL wings I got the ATL dry rub as well.....which wasnt a bad choice but I'll have try another spicy flavor next time . These were just a lil too boring for me. Shoestring fries, drink and 12 wings was 17-18 bucks so a little pricey for this neck of the woods but maybe the Arcadia folk may place enough catering orders to keep these people around.",

The chefs special sauce and ATL style are my favorites so far. definitely will be back to try more!

Called a third time then the phone just kept ringing.  We finally got there. Parking lot was not full at all. Only one person in line when we went inside, and only 3-4 people waiting for their food. When it was our turn to order we mentioned to the cashier that we had tried to call earlier and someone left us on hold. She then proceeded to tell us that because it's a Tuesday night, \"the phones always ring off the hook so it drops calls, it happens at all locations, and we have lines of customers out the door.\"  I could NOT believe what she had just told us. I didn't know whether to laugh or get upset! The phone did not ring once when we were waiting in line. It was 8:35pm, If I was blind and deaf she could've fooled me with the lie about the line and the phones hahah it was pretty much empty and quiet. Clean tables with the chairs already set up for closing.   We chose to leave than to stand there and talk to someone who does not know right from left.",

Especially by their dry rubs. That Spicy ATL rub is sensational. A flavor combo that you definitely won't find elsewhere around PHX. But then other times, I eat their wings and the meat is dried out or I take a bite and there's a ton of excess oil in the wing. I am not really sure what is going on here but it seems like they have some issues with their consistency. Haven't entirely wrote these guys off though because their dry rub is so good. I'll return at some point in the future. Hopefully, I was just unlucky a couple of times and that is in the past now.",

They need to replace her with the previous girl Veronica.  Well back again food is good. I ordered on the phone but it takes forever might as well just come and order because the wait is the same. Even when asked if they can start the order because I am on my way they don't Been here for over 20 minutes waiting and still no wings. Will be late for work again for waiting.",

    "text": "We were famished after our flight in and decided to try this place out after seeing the 4 Star ratings. What a big disappointment it was. First red flag was when I asked the cashier what ATL flavor was. She just replied it was s dry rub. Yes, but what does it taste like? Salty, sweet, spicy, herbal, etc? She didn't know how to describe it and just said it was good and that she liked it. We decided to try a 24 wing selection in 4 flavors- garlic Parmesan, lemon pepper, ATL and medium buffalo. Also tried out seasoned fries and baked beans with bacon.   The wings literally came out in 2 minutes which was another red flag. Sure enough they had been refried to heat them up then sauced. The result was dry jerky-like wings that stuck in between our teeth. Best flavor was prob ATL which was a salty spiced rub. The fries were oily and we had to remind them we hadn't gotten our beans. The guy berated the cashier for forgetting our beans and went to scoop out a small portion in a styrofoam cup for us. I dug in and it was not only deathly sweet but not even lukewarm. At the end of our meal I went to return our virtually untouched beans and to tell them to check their temp. It was definitely the third red flag-- a health and safety violation serving hot foods below 140F. The beans were probably more like at 70F-- cause for concern of getting food poisoning.  Overall definitely not a place I could or would recommend. Steer clear and save your money and health. For the record, I am a tourist from CA, not a competitor. Just an avid wing connoisseur who left ATL Wings mighty disappointed.",

The honey habanero used to be my go to wing favor but whoever they got now making the wings really sucks. Tasted more like teriyaki sauce than anything. The place is filthy dirty and I'm surprised they haven't been dinged yet from the health inspector.

    "text": "We stopped in on an early Monday afternoon, there were 4 other customers there.  I had never been to ATL wings before and  curious about the whole \"ATL\" bit, because I am FROM Atlanta.  I wasn't sure if this was supposed to have something to do with Atlanta or it was just something the company was capitalizing on.  The general vibe was pretty normal, nothing spectacular, but absolutely fine.  Things appeared clean and well kept.  At the counter, we were greeted by a young man who appeared to be anything but thrilled to talk to us. (I get it, I too have worked fast food and waited tables before, but please pretend to care just a little bit). As I stood at the counter and peered at the menu, talking about what was what, the employee propped his foot up and looked down at his cell phone and started typing.  Guess we were taking up his precious texting time.  Ok fine.  We placed our order, got drinks and sat down and one of the many empty tables.  I got up to go wash my hands and found the single bathroom door was locked.  I thought someone was in there and thought nothing of it and headed back to my seat.  As I passed the counter I saw the Costco size bottle of generic hand sanitizer on the counter, that I couldn't believe I had not noticed before.  After a few minutes another customer had some sort of accident and got wing sauce in his eye and headed toward the bathroom to find the door locked, just like I did.  However instead of just wanting to wash his hands he was in pain and needed actual water, not the contents from some gallon jug of alcohol gel to splash on his eyes.  Squinting and holding a napkin up to his eye he walked to the counter and asked to the abyss and lack of employee presence if there was a key to the restroom.  I overheard a voice telling him yes.  A few moments passed, and I am sure in eye burning wing sauce time it was an eternity.  The employee called out she couldn't find the key.  The guy grabbed some napkins and headed back to his table, rubbing his eye.  Ok there is a restroom key, duly noted.  The place clears out, and it just us 2 and the employees.  I assume there were employees, as nobody was wearing anything close to a uniform, not the same shirt, name tags, nothing, so honestly I have no idea who actually worked there.  My boyfriend goes to wash his hands because you know, WINGS, and having watched the hard lesson from the wing sauce in the eye guy, goes to the counter and asked the girl wandering for the restroom key.  I told him I wanted the key when he was finished so I too could wash the wing sauce off my hands.  Much to his surprise she didn't hand him a key, like a highway gas station attendant might, but rather escorted him to the bathroom door and unlocked it for him like a drug rehab attendant might.  He came back to the table and let me know I would have to go find the girl to get the key.  I became irritated and decided I didn't need an escort to a restroom facility or minimally a sink to wash my hands.  It was an extremely uncomfortable situation and I was very unhappy.  I understand the particular area of the city may not be the best with transient folks possibly wandering in from time to time, but I checked the Panda Express next door and they had no locks on their restrooms.  So it must not be too much of a problem.  That was this particular location, my boyfriend assures me the situation is not the same at the Tempe location.  I must tell you, the wings were OK at best.  I would say an easy 50 steps below Zipp's wings and maybe 2 steps above some frozen Tyson wings you get at the supermarket and about 500+ steps below local wings places in ATLANTA.  To that end, speaking as an Atlanta native, living in Phoenix, this particular establishment has zero characteristics of the soul of Atlanta.  I may be speaking out of turn, as it is not clear if \"ATL\" is in reference to Atlanta.  But nothing is clear judging by their website.  Unfortunately all one can go on is the service and quality of the food, which at best was less than Roach-Coach grade. Needless to say, I will not be back, and my BIG verbose voice of warning will reach far and wide across the valley.",

    "text": "After reading a nice review in the Phoenix New Times magazine, my wife and I decide to try ATL wings. Located on the southwest corner of 40th street and Thomas, the restaurant is easy to find and has a large sign visible from the roadway. The inside is clean and proudly boasts the A rating from the health department. The staff were all super-friendly (and displayed some excellent tattoos!)   Three flat screen monitors show the menu over the ordering counter (I love this!). They specialize in wings, so the menu is fairly limited. This is by design. The theory is rather than offer a ton of variety that is just 'okay,' they want to focus on one main item and do it really well! Therefore, the menu lists just chicken wings (bone-in or boneless), salads, fries, pancakes, biscuits and drinks. That is IT (apart from the ranch or blue cheese dressings/dipping sauces).  They have three different styles of wing - BBQ, HOT WING and DRY RUB. There are several flavor variations you can select under each style. We were puzzled what the ATL dry rub tasted like, since it has no description or point of reference. They asked if we would like to try it and offered us two chicken wings, free to taste. That was unexpected and the ATL dry rub was unlike the flavor of any chicken wing I've tasted before it. It was good, though, and so we ordered 10 wings with the ATL dry rub and 10 wings medium. We also ordered two fountain drinks and an order of the biscuits.   We paid at the counter, they gave us our self-serve drink cups, wrote my name on the receipt, told us to sit anywhere we like and they would bring the food out to us shortly.  The fountain machine is Coke products (yay!) and they also have tea (sweetened and un-sweetened)and three different flavors of Kool-Aid to choose from.  Just finishing filling our drinks and putting the lids and straws on our cups, when our order was being served! (Apparently, they pre-cook the wings about 3/4's of the way, then remove them. When you order, the wings go back in to cook for 3 more minutes, and then they're done! Don't worry, they don't let partially cooked wings sit out all day until you order them. Just like KFC, Popeye's, Church's Chicken and other fast-food chicken restaurants, pre-prepared menu items are 'under a clock.')   We don't like wet, soggy wings. Places that cook them in ovens or broilers often have this undesirable, gummy-like, chicken texture. I like my wings to be firm and a little dry. Let the sauce and my saliva draw out the texture and flavor of the chicken. I have to ask most places to make my wings crispy. But not here. That's the way come out by default and, I'm told, there are some customers who request they cook them even longer! God bless America! :)  I'm happy to report the wings were served piping hot from the fryer and the ATL dry rub tasted better and better the more I ate it. I can't figure out what's in it other than butter. Its a weird taste, but I kinda like it. The medium wings tasted really hot (spicy) but as I ate more them, I guess I started to become numb to it. I think next time mild will be my choice. Some places (native new yorker) consider mild to mean butter-sauce only. Yech. Mild is meant to refer to the HEAT. A butter-sauce does not define MILD-HEAT. A butter-sauce only defines NO HEAT! Anyway, the point is, the mild at ATL means MILD-HEAT (not just butter-sauce).  The biscuits are not what I would call biscuits. They are more like tiny Beignets or two-bite pastries. Just imagine a cinnamon-flavored donut hole, covered with powdered sugar, sitting in a shallow puddle of honey. Sounds good, right? SPOILER ALERT!!! It is!  I'm excited they opened a west side location on 51st Ave and Northern!!! YAY!!!  I only have one minor complaint about this visit. The wings should have been served with celery to help cut the heat and refresh the palette between bites.  The total was $20, which is about right for a lunch for two and we certainly did not leave hungry!  On Tuesdays, you can get sixty-five cent wings if you sign up for their special offers by texting \"ATL\" to 60259.   ATL is not meant to refer to Atlanta (sorry, Atlanta airport!) ATL stands for All The Luv.",

I tasted the sauce for that wings and it tasted totally different once on the wings... Probably because they reused the mixing bowls. The fries were with extra salt (not requested) and the cheese wasn't anywhere to be found. Plus they were soggy so I'm glad I didn't have them put cheese wiz on them. And the boneless wings- 10.00 for ten (10) McDonald's sized nuggets. I should have went .02 miles to wing stop or a couple blocks further to raisin canes and got better food for cheaper.

The girl brought out my wings, they gave me 12 instead of 10 which I thought was really cool, also plenty of Ranch.  Another girl also brought me a complimentary drink cup, another plus in my book.  I took half the order home because these are nice plump wings!  I also bowed down to the cooks before I left and said Thanks guys, the wings were phenomenal.

I came in and there was only another couple in there eating so I didn't have a wait at all. There are a ton of options to pick from. I knew I wanted traditional wings (not boneless) and extra crispy and normally I get mild sauce so that's what I went with. Well, a few minutes later 6 piping hot saucy wings and a side of ranch were placed in front of me. They were so hot I had to wait a few minutes to eat them. A few other customers had come in and you could tell it was their first time. Well, one of the guys explained the dry rubs, bbq and sauces to her and asked if they wanted a sample of the ATL flavoring wing which is what they are known for (ATL = All The Love) and they sampled some of the other sauces while they made up their mind. I wish I would have know this because I would have sampled a few that I'm not familiar with. Well, I started talking to the guy that offered a sample wing and he did the same for me as I told him it was my first time there. Oh my god was it the BEST wing/flavoring I've every had!!!! I wish I would of had that wing prior to ordering as that's what I would have ordered (just means I gotta go back now).   Everyone was friendly but the girl that took the orders was a little quiet and didn't explain anything about the spices/rubs/sauces while the gentleman who offered the samples and explained the menu to customers was awesome. He made everyone smile!  I am looking forward to coming back soon for some more ATL Wings!!!",

On Tuesday it's .65 wings which is a little cheaper than normal but if you get fries and a drink it's a couple dollars more than if you bought a combo any other day of the week. Tuesday is supposed to be a sale on wings but it's actually the day they can make more money on not so money savvy customers.",

They let me try a couple of the sauces and let my friend try a chicken wing since she was new and asking about one of the flavors! So generous! The chicken wings are nice and crispy. I had the extreme honey habanero and Spicy ATL wings. Both AMAZING and a REAL kick! Love it. They aren't playing around there! When you order a side it comes with a free drink, so that is a bonus as well. I highly recommend their ALT fries. They were huge! I would share with a friend. :)",

Got my order within 10 minutes (ordered 36 wings three different flavors and got an order of bacon fries) and the food was hot and fresh.   The wings were surprisingly crispy even though they were covered in sauce, paired it with a Koolaid (when in Rome) which I never drink, and not gonna lie I really enjoyed it!  The service was great, the staff is friendly and I'm definitely coming back again.  FYI Hope the lovely young lady at the front is awesome! I'm telling everyone about ATL!",

    "text": "Wing it no further. ATL is my default choice and I can't say no! A good lunch spot, dinner, ordering out, catering, or a quick bite.  They have many flavors but really it comes down to a few styles. Boneless/Bone-in(traditional) and dry-rub/saucy.  1.) Boneless or Traditional, you get a decent amount of meat but it feels wrong to get the boneless.  2.) Dry rub or saucy the crunch/crispiness is retained. I've also ordered to go and a 15 minute drive later they are still unbelievably crisp and full of texture.  If it wasn't enough for you, request extra well done for even more crisp. Some people might have experienced a more dry meat doing this but personally I prefer it.  Some of my favorites: ATL style is a dry rub after the wings are coated in a mystery sauce. It's almost like a Montreal&ranch seasoning. The spicy version does build up in heat and can really tingle the lips.  Chef style which is a mix of sauces and spices unique to the name.  As a warning Toxic is pure heat and no buffalo or spices were present.  Save room for Cajun fries. Be careful if your ordering a tray, that's about 4 servings. If you don't want fries grab some biscuits, either with bacon and cheese, honey, syrup or why not try bacon and honey?  They have kool-aid on tap as well as sweet tea and standard soda options.",

Today's visit does not make me want to ever return. Guy at register was in another world! Sat down and looked around realized this place is nasty. Dirt windows, chairs covered in greasy hand prints, light fixtures where covered in dust, dirty floor. Etc.. Got my order to go and left. When I opened the order at home I couldn't believe the regular fries I ordered. They were So greasy I don't know if they refried them or what but I told my kids step away and through them in the trash. Thank goodness the wings were good!",

Some of the spicy sauces will really get you, had me sweating a few times. I wish I could find wings where I live like these, I would go often. The lunch rush can get a little hectic as there's not a ton of seating. There is an open kitchen and you can see them cooking and dressing the wings. Oh, and they have three types of koolaid near the soda machine. If you like wings this place is a must try..",

So I got the ATL original and The Chef's Special. The favors did not disappoint. And I've never had crisper wings. Not burnt, crispy!! The fact that they were still crispy even taking my order to go and eating them an hour later. I also ordered ATL style fries and honey biscuits. The fries were good but probably better if you eat them there. The biscuits were delicious!!! Oh and did I mention they serve Kool Aid?!?! When I saw that my inner child came out! Yes I got the Blue Raspberry Lemonade! The service was friendly and quick! They let me taste test a couple of sauces before I made my decision. This place might be my new weekly wing joint!

It's so many flavors to choose from it's overwhelming and you honestly will start to just come back to try every flavor like I do. Now I get the bottles to go  shit is fire   ALSO, THE KOOL-AID IS ON TAP PEOPLE. #OnTapDammit NO ONE ELSE IS DOING THIS, grape, Red (because that is a flavor) and blue lemonade will change your damm life.

BUT I was recommended to try this place by friends at work - specifically the biscuits. Normally I'm a spice fanatic, and chicken wing sauce is absolutely delicious to me. I've tried their hot and medium spice levels, and I've decided that if I don't have the urge to cry that day, I prefer medium. The wings themselves have really good texture and are juicy. You have the option to get biscuits with syrup, honey, powdered sugar or cinnamon on them, or a combination of any of the toppings. They also have fries that you can get cajun seasoning on or even cheesy. They do offer catering, and the prices are reasonable for how much you get and how tasty everything is. This also seems like a pretty good place to bring a group, because they do have seating that you can group together and TVs with sports or news channels on. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who loves wings.",

Lady, I'm already on the phone with you can you just please tell me what quantities your wings come in, how hard is that?!!!!! You should know this off the top of your head you take orders all day it's your job!!!!!! I tried not to flip out as I wanted my wings because it was my daughters birthday and thats what she asked for, so I hang up look at their menu online then call back to place my order. This lyric girl must of been really busy doing something not work related because obviously she did not want to be bothered. The second time I called she put me on hold, 5 min hold I hang up and call back so frustrated at this point. She says oh im sorry I dont know how we got disconnected. Ummm I do know, you're not doing your damn job and you want to be left alone so you put me on hold. After that I just didn't want to order from this location When you're being treated like this over the phone I can just imagine the effort they put into preparing the food. I asked for her name so I can report her to her boss and I was on my way to another wing place where I was treated like a good business treats their customers. I wont ever be visiting this location but I might give their glendale location a try sometime since it has decent reviews.",

    "text": "I came here because I been here two other times before and the wings are good. This time I brought my son who doesn't eat wings. This place doesn't have burgers or pizza like other wing places so the compromise was cheese fries that they have on the menu. Which are 3.30 and 4.75 with bacon. So my son opted for the fries without bacon. So I asked the cashier if I can get a kids meal and upgrade the fries to cheese fries for more and naturally she said yes. The kids meal was 6.75 and I was willing pay more to satisfy my son. I ordered 12 wings and asked the cashier if I can mixed the rub which she said no to. I advised her that I was able to mix my rubs before and she advised me the owner where in and they don't like that. I was a little taken back but then I agreed. So then the order is ready everything was good to go but no cheese fries just fries. I quickly told the lady who was handing me the food so she looked at the receipt as if I was lying and confirmed what I said. She then grabs a little bowl of cheese and I said no I wanted cheese fries she and anther worker a male voice began to raise their voice and said this is their cheese fries. The experiences was horrible for me they are very rude. The table was dirty I had to ask them to clean them. If the fries don't come with cheese I think it would make since for them to have fries with  cheese on the side on the menu because most cheese fries have cheese on them. All of this happened after I payed as they make you pay first. Good food but Very bad service.",

The ATL style wings are hands down my favorite - I get them with the ATL style fries (seeing a pattern here?) and sometimes the biscuits (DELICIOUS. GET THEM). The Cajun BBQ wings are also amazing, and my fiance and I can both compromise on the medium wings (he would order Toxic if it was up to solely him, and I am more of a mild kinda girl). The employees have all been very friendly and helpful every time we've visited. Basically, wings are delicious, all their wings are even moreso delicious, go here and eat wings.",

Seating is open table. Accoutrements are self serve.  There is a soda fountain station, as well as Ice Tea and Kool Aid. The wings were served quickly, hot and tasted excellent.  I like them hot and zesty and that's what I got. Each order came with ranch dressing. We arrived and ordered just in time as the lunch crowd started showing up and the line extended to the front door. Tuesday is 75 cents wings so expect it to be busy.  ATL offers a host of flavors to augment anyone's taste buds.  We both agreed that ATL is our new favorite place for wings!",

We're torn as to if they're really better than Long Wong's (down the block), but they are excellent, the fries are magnificent (and one order is PLENTY for two - we bought two orders and have TONS left over). We tried the ATL and the mild; could have gone for medium (mild had a nice little bite, but not too spicy).   The ATL wings have a magnificent flavor, and remind me of the wings on the appetizer menu of the much-missed Baby Kay's. Crispy and meaty and flavorful. Delicious! They are definitely more expensive than Long Wong's, but clearly their passion is wings, plus there's more variety, so we'll be back again!",

My favorite has to be the Chef's special, some combination of ranch and hot sauce, pretty amazing! I wish the wings were a bit saucier thou.  They make their own ranch/blue cheese, I'm a big ranch fan, and I do NOT like their ranch at all, too thick and NO flavor. Plus, they don't give you enough. C'mon! It's a wing place!

The tables that were open were dirty, and no one seemed concerned about cleaning them. I took some paper towels and cleaned the table. I ordered the Cajun Hot (6 each) and Cajun BBQ (6 each) and a pop for $13.07.  Went to the bathroom, and they only have one for both sexes... hence it was not the best. The toilet was stopped up, from the last customer, who left a parting gift.  After I got my food, the wings did not seem to be hot (temperature wise). Which is odd, because I know they make them fresh to order... I can only guess, they are using cold sauces, which cools down the wings...so the wings were flavorful, but only get 3 stars.  My friend ordered the boneless wings, which looked like one inch mini-nuggets. When I asked him how he liked them he responded, \"Ehhhh, they will make a turd.\"  I joked and told him, \"A very tiny one..\" So I guess a 3 is about the best I could give this place. Not the best but not the worst either.",

    "text": "There's a ton 5-star reviews for this place, and they (the 5-star reviews) were the thing that really drew me in, other than my lust for hot wings; however, upon experiencing ATL Wings, I am a little perplexed by all of them (the 5-star reviews).  First things first.    This place is counter service with a moderately sized eating area reminiscent of a sub shop in configuration... It's great for carryout or a quick meal.  The wings...  The bone in wings are good.  The sauces are good.  Boneless wings were most likely frozen/pre-breaded, but my kid liked them.  The Ranch and Blue Cheese dipping sauces let a little to be desired, but were good as well.  Everything was good, and just that: Good, not 5-star.  When I think 5-star, I think amazing and unique.  If this place had more going for it in the accouterments department like Booze/Beer/Wine or a more inviting dining area,  I could see 4-stars, but a counter that pushes out good wings, good fries, good sauce and kool-aid just isn't deserving.  I can think of many other places that have at least one type of wings that slays this place:  Four Peaks' off menu habenero hot wings and their top notch blue cheese dipping sauce. Teakwoods' wings - a ton of styles and killing suicide Zipps' wings - tons of style too. Cornish Pasty's Tandoori Wings.  This is just the short list, and all of these places' wings beat ATL and the establishments also offer a whole other level of food, drink, and ambiance to enjoy as well.  Overall, I would hit this place up for a quick lunch or if I needed carryout and I was in the area; however, with just a little more effort one can find better wings.",

Second time ordering from the restaurant,  I order over the phone for take out. I was pretty excited since my first time experience was good. Now when I called at 11:45am I assume it was rush hour for them . A woman answer the phone and began to take my order.  ( I record every conversation I have just because memory base) I told her my order she read it back I spelt my name for her .she confirmed my noon order. My GF went to pick it up at 1230 which is fine I dont mind it being cold . The problem was the name  was wrong so my GF didnt recieve the order . She came home told me and I replayed my recording to myself questioning how did this happen . I went there in person the lady got on defense said she attempted to make my order twice and my GF left so she threw it away saying it was cold . Right before I got there I called talk to a gentleman about the order he confirmed he could make it in ten mins . Pulled up no order they say they wanted to make sure I showed . Well this all wouldn't be a problem if the name wasnt wrong and also properly just take information correctly ie my number . I'm disappointed and anger !!",

The customer service was amazing. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and our food came out very quick but was also extremely fresh. The wings were big and tasty. They were not greedy with the ranch on the side either which was greatly appreciated. Also tried the cool-aid flavors (blueberry, grape, and fruit punch) because it had been years since last time I had had some. The to-go containers are left out for customers and the staff even had filled up some ketchup cups with lids to go. The store was extremely clean as well. I think I'm in love with ATL Wings.",

The staff was very friendly and helped us with a recommendation which was 12 wings and french fry's and how cool we got a free soda.    I loved the crushed ice they use instead of big cubes you find everywhere else.  The wings were deep fried and crispy.  The flavor was amazing and there was lots of BBQ sauce on the wings.  Very tasty and filling. 5 stars on the wings.  The frys were very tasty and not the typical frys you get at a fast food restaurant .  The only reason I gave 4 stars is there was way too much salt on the frys.  MAKE SURE TO TELL THEM LIGHT SALT and you will give them 5 stars for sure.  I will be back for sure.",

I think this is the first time my husband and I have walked out of a restaurant after having a few bites of food. It just wasn't worth us forcing ourselves to eat a horrible meal. I think the topper to the meal was the dead cockroach on the floor by our table. Not even he liked it!  Lol. Our wings and fries were so greasy. We took the wings out of the tray and put them on a paper towel to soak up the grease. They were tasteless as well. I should have asked for my money back - but decided to leave our trays full of food on the table. The staff was nice, but that is the only nice thing I can say about ATL wings.",

No big deal I know they're busy. However I can hear what is being said and after being on hold for at least 7 min both attempts on different days I hung up. There was no reason I should've been on hold for that long. After being forgotten on the phone both times at the Glendale location I called the Phoenix location and they took my order immediately. This last visit I called ahead before I got off work. After driving through crazy traffic I arrive to pick my food up at the Phoenix location and it's not ready. I had to wait another 15+ min after driving over an hour through traffic to pick food up. My fries were hard, cold and greasy. My boneless wings were good though.   I'll still visit this place because I love the food. Just wish my past few visits had been a lot better.",

    "text": "Let me start this review off by saying. I love ATL wings. I drive from Surprise to the location on 51st Ave anytime I want wings.   First and last visit at this location at around 7:30 pm. I had family come in town and this location was the closest from the airport. When we arrived the place was a wreck. There was garbage on all the tables and the floors had all sorts of stuff on it. I immediately turned around and headed back outside and then the party I was with stated they were really hungry and tired from the travel. We decided against better judgement to stay and eat.   We approached the counter and the out of towers was advised they could not sample the sauce. We then were advised to buy a wing. We were confused and said never mind. At this time another guy approached the counter and said wait we will let you sample it on a wing. There were 6 people who had never visited this place. He gave us 2 wings.   The total number in our party was 15 people. We reviewed the menu and when we went back to start placing the order we were advised they only had 50 wings. I asked a simple question to the cashier guy. I said when I initially came to the counter I asked you how many sauces could I pick for the 96 wing combo. I stated you advised me any way I want to split it up you could do it.  I said so if you didn't have 96 wings that would have been a great time to state we normally could split them up anyway you like but currently we don't have 96 wings. I asked if he agreed and his response was he forgot. At this point I said fine give me all you have. I then asked for 5 orders of cheese fries to which he replied he was out of those as well. I am really annoyed by now. I ask if there is anything else he is out of he states no. I then ask for fried biscuits and then he states oh we are out of those too I am so sorry. I ask if he has boneless wings he states yes I attempt to order the amount I need he says I only have 10. I say fine I attempt to order salad which they are out of as we'll. At this point someone yells fro the fryer we have some fries. I am heated an state just give me what you have. To get to the point besides the horrible service the food was horrible. They were apparently running low or out of the ATL sauce which was the majority flavored we ordered. The wings and fries were overcooked. The boneless wings were undercooked and under sauced. The flavors we ordered were messed up as well.   Another note we were all sitting at the tables ready to eat when they brought the food over in bags and advised that they were closing soon. The hours state they close at 9 pm. I am assuming since they were out of food they were closing early. I advised ok but we will be dining in since there is over an hour left to closing. While we are attempting to consume this inedible stuff they served us people we notice they are frying chicken and the workers appear to be packing food up. Customers are coming in and placing orders and getting upset when they say they have no wings. One man came in and asked well what is he frying if they are out of wings? The guy stated I don't know I said we were out and the customer began to tell them they were ghetto amongst other things to which one of the guys at the fryer (who was obviously frying more wings I guess for him to take home for himself) replied he was from Compton crip life threw up some sign and told him to meet him on the side of the building. He told the man he was going to beat his donkey( he's used the other A word). The man stated lets go female dog and exited the restaurant and the worker left out of the back door at this point we packed up quickly and left.  I will never ever eat here again. The service the food was horrible and obviously they had more wings but just decided they didn't want to serve the customers.",

I tried 3 flavors: Hot, Medium, and ATL Spicy.  All of them were really good.  I would come back to try all of the flavors.    The wings were HUGE and cooked to order.  The sauces were excellent.  We shared a couple baskets of fries that were also pretty good.    The service here was excellent.  I really didn't think it would be a 5 star review but the service took it there.  We were given a sample wing when we came in and then we were given a beignet on the way out.    ATL Wings is doing it right.  I hope I get one closer to me so I can come back more often.  Stay up!",

    "text": "I am visiting Phoenix and had a craving for wings. So based on the reviews I chose this place and it didn't disappoint. The wings were large and they were cooked right. You have a choice of sauces and I chose the Cajun Hot since it was the hottest. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the Cajun hot sauce was not all that hot, but I do have a high tolerance for spice.",

Over cooked, dry and saturated with oil. I'll never go back. Long Wongs and Wing stop are superior to ATL Wings. Bottom line I'm super dissapointed and was a waste if my $. The 2 stars is for the Koolaide.",

    "text": "I love wings and ATL has been on my radar for a while.  When a group of my friends wanted to go there, I was super excited, but I had heard mixed reviews from a few other friends that have tried it before.    We went on Sunday around lunch time.  It was decently busy, but they were efficient.  When they heard it was my first time, they gave me a free wing with the ATL rub.  It was tasty.  I ordered 5 ATL and 5 garlic parm.  Both were good.  My friends loved the Kool-aid.  They tried the ATL cakes too and said it was similar to a funnel cake.    I will definitely be back to try more flavors!",

For a little hole in the wall they are fairly pricey (likely due to the quality of the wings)  I'm knocking off 1 star because I want to phone in orders every week and they NEVER answer their phone. I drive over and they aren't busy so I'm not sure what is going on. I usually have to sit and wait for my to go order for 15-20 minutes because they won't pick up they're phone.",
