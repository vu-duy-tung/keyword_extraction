Sadly I was underwhelmed. Bananas and strawberries were ok. The blueberries looked like a normal blueberry's embarrassing cousin. It's what I imagine the blueberries in a boxed muffin mix to look like. By the time I was done with my one waffle my boyfriend had annihilated his omelet, hash browns, and pancakes before I could try anything of his. Damn ectomorphs. He said it was all great though.",

I ordered the home fries, he ordered the other potato. I liked the home fries best. Our waitress, Penny, had a great personality! She was warm and engaging. I am a huge fan of pancakes, these were fluffy and tasted almost nutty. I liked, but didn't love, them they tasted almost manufactured in a way, and looked too perfect. As if they had mean made by a machine and shipped in. I also didn't love the taste of the coffee, but I'm kind of a coffee snob. Overall it was a great experience the omelette and customer service was excellent, and I will be back!",

Since I don't eat pork, I asked if we could have turkey bacon instead. The waitress thought it would be okay if it was a dollar of charge. And that was fine with me. But when she asked the manager, the manager said no. You have to take the special as it is. I do understand that perspective however since I don't eat pork that was my only option. I went ahead and ordered it with the bacon and gave the bacon to the Cook's. I just feel it was very poor customer service. It doesn't happen that often I'm quite sure there's no difference in cost. Our waitress was wonderful however. She constantly kept it would make sure that everything was okay.",

    "text": "A little disappointed as this place has relatively good reviews. Here is my justification for my rating. I ordered the bowl of fruit and I did not expect it to look like the picture, obviously. When I got it, it had bananas, grapes and strawberries. The bananas were overly mushy and the grapes were a little to wrinkly. Strawberries seemed fine.  My wife ordered biscuits with gravy, 3 eggs and 3 sausages. Now here is where the big disappointment was...the biscuit was hard and tasted a little rancid. The biscuits seemed they might have been a few days old just sitting around. I place my faith that this was not the case, but there was certainly something wrong with the biscuit.  The sausage tasted a little off. Not in a bad way but off.   The eggs, well that is hard to get wrong when cooking it sunny side up.   Overall, if you're going to charge $5.49 for a bowl of fruit, it should be of better quality. Bananas that were probably going to be thrown out that day should not be served like that. It's summer, so throwing in some melons would have been great.    The service was good and are waitress made sure to check up on us here and there which we appreciated, but the quality of the food that was served should not have been that poor. I might give it one more shot down the road so hopefully that experience will be better.",

The waitresses are friendly and will help with the plentiful menu choices. Everything we had was cooked to perfection and delicious. On top of it the cost won't break the bank either.",

So it's a diner type place, my son and I opted to eat at the counter, I really hate taking tables for us two when there are larger parties waiting. The staff truly is so friendly and on top of things! As I sat there I saw a lot of customers stopping saying hello to waitstaff who knew them by name etc... a lot of regulars here and I can see why! The portions are huge and prices are great. I had the chicken fried steak, home potatoes and biscuit and eggs, my chicken fried steak was crispy and covered in gravy, the potatoes were good my biscuit I honestly have not had it yet, I brought it home as I just could not finish my food. My son also could not finish his food, but he said it was good. This had a very home cooked feel and I truly appreciate that. I like that this is not a chain type of place and it had such a welcoming feeling. I will definitely be back and quite honestly it's about a 30 min drive for me but I'd even make that drive opposed to something closer mostly because the staff was awesome and the food was good... now if your expecting fancy this isn't it but this works for me!",

They make it in-house and slow-roast it all day. I will probably only order dishes that include it when we return.  The service is excellent and the staff is attentive and very good at their jobs. Also, you get a lot of food for your money. They have their own blend of Guatamalen coffee, too.",

Walked in and the restaurant was very busy which was a good sign and we were seated pretty quickly. . . . Decor was old fashioned themed non formal vibe made you feel at home. Because the restaurant was busy it seemed that they were short staffed because it took forever to get our order and drink refills. The food came out room temperature and wasn't that great in taste. We ordered basic breakfast   hard to go wrong. Pancakes were cold and potatoes were over cooked . To make matters worse the bill came to $53 for 1 kids meal and two adults. Needless to say I was very disappointed, however the staff was extremely friendly. That being said I won't be back.",

The poached eggs were served on top of an English muffin with fresh avocado on the side and hollandaise to top the eggs off. The house fries were their version of hash browns.   I had a little more trouble deciding, as I usually try to taste new things. After much deliberation I decided on the El Patron Skillet. This cosists of a bed of country potatoes, cheese, chorizo, pickled jalapenos, and eggs done your way (I ordered mine scrambled). Salsa and sour cream are served on the side. You also get a choice of tortilla, toast, English muffin, or biscuit. I decided on the biscuit, which was huge!  My wife was pleasantly happy with her breakfast. Not many places do eggs Benedict to her liking, though she is not too picky. As for me, everything was delicious! The biscuit was not as fluffy as I hoped but nonetheless it was good.   The service was awesome. From the minute we went into the establishment, which resembles an old diner, everyone smiled and welcomed us without making it awkward. We felt their friendliness and overall attitude was genuine. We will definitely be coming back to this place. Thanks for the great food and service.",

We went back again last weekend and this time I ordered an omelette with cheddar cheese, green onions, mushrooms, and avocados. There was WAY too much cheese on it which made the omelette very oily.

I don't want anything but water with breakfast so that wouldn't work for me. I ordered the Biscuit's and Gravy which was horrible and cost $7 for two dry biscuits and mediocre gravy. This place is as expensive (if not slightly more) as iHop with 1/100th the options. The service is nice but extraordinarily slow. My daughter said the french toast was pretty good.

I came in on a Monday at 10am to avoid crowds and I'm glad I did. I was warmly greeted the second I walked in the door, taken to a table, served immediately and had fresh piping hot food in front of me within 5 minutes! Don't know if fast Eddie could keep up with that! Service was great. Refills on coffee, checking back and the food was great. I had the meat lovers plate with toast and added a biscuit and gravy. The eggs were cooked perfect, the gravy wasn't too thick or thin and the biscuit was nice and fresh. Good coffee and boy did I leave full. Will definitely be back to try the 4 or 5 different Benedict plates on tree menu.",

To begin with we asked for a high chair which the waiter gracefully went off to get. 5 minutes of waiting with an empty restaurant surronding us I asked again and she finally went to actually get it. I wasn't upset though busy minds are okay but then I asked for an Iced Coffee and never got it and couldn't remind the server again because once she dropped off our food she left to never return. I wad still perfectly okay with everything didnt mind the poor service but then once our check was given to this time around she seemed frustated and upset which threw me off? I wondered why she was so upset towards us but I ignored it once more. After I handed my card to her I asked for a box and oh boy did she not deliver once again. Then my husband turns to me and says \"wait did anyone get a coffee?\" I asked for one of course but throughout the whole mean never received it so why ask? Well he said I think there was a coffee on the receipt. Which I hoped their wasnt but oh and behold there it was! She not only gave me vad service and lacked at everything but she charged me for something I didnt even receive so now here I am done and frustrated at a waited we had done nothing to asking for a refund for the coffee I didnt even get. She angrily gave me back 3 dollars bills and was silent to us until we left. The food was decent but not worth the awful service.",

Our waitress was nice and courteous but made more than enough mistakes for us to take notice. My favorite breakfast is biscuits and gravy but the biscuits here are just not something I'm use to. They are huge but not a good way in my opinion. The eggs were very mediocre. I literally could have easily made these scrambled eggs at home. My friend wanted some country potatoes, but they gave her what looked liked country potatoes that were put through a pasta roller. Just big strips, not strands of mashed potatoes. Is that suppose to be hash browns? I don't know. And what really did it for me was when my card was accidentally used to on another tables huge bill. They said they fixed it but the info is still pending on my card and I won't be happy until its gone. Anyways, this place is like a diner, similar to Denny's but not as clean. Not going to lie, I would have rather gone to Denny's. At least my experience with them has been consistent. I don't think I would come back again, but if I ever do and its a better experience, I will update.",

Ice cream wasn't offered and when asked as walking out she said \"do you want some?\" (Ice cream comes with the meal!) Owner/manager (?) was also very busy chatting and didn't seem to care about the patrons.

The food looked so beautiful and tasted just as good! They even give a 10% GCU student discount (all you do is show I.D.) and the meal was so affordable as well! The portion sizes were big as well, plenty left to take home!",

Can't think of any reason that I'd be willing to eat here again. I'm giving them two stars because our party of seven was seated with nearly no wait and our service was really good. Our server was friendly and accommodating. The food take longer to come out than we thought it should considering they weren't packed the day we were there...and then it was all ruined by the hair.

I voluntarily participated in gluttony because I hate that hollandaise sauce separates when it is reheated. We have been in town a few days and have been striking out on my yelping. This was a win for our late breakfast. I guess if I'm going to get picky I should explain why not 5 stars. My second round of coffee wasnt hot so it kinda killed my coffee momentum and my pancakes were a needing a bit more syrup and were slightly tough around the corners. However... That's just me being picky. We will eat here again the next time we are in town!",

The staff at Cracked Egg are warm, friendly, and  accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their food as bland and tastless.   We really wanted to like the cracked Egg so badly, but the way to begin a meal is not with brunt black toast, over- cooked eggs/bacon, and undercooked potatoes. The entire meal from beginning to end just wasn't good.  I wasn't expecting a 5 star meal, however, I would have expected food that wasn't burnt or overcooked.",

The green Chile wasn't green and the chorizo was so spicy I couldn't touch my coffee with turning my mouth into a flamethrower. The Nicaraguan coffee was flavorless. The McDonalds had more flavor from the night before. The best items were the corn tortillas and wheat toast. The rest was really underwhelming. Your choice on what to do but if I was a local I wouldn't go back since too many problems with food quality. Sorry.",

    "text": "Seriously, Yay!  I'm a fan.  While I do love my fancy brunches with mimosas on deck, I still very much love a good old fashioned breakfast.  Old fashioned as in  ... crispy edges on my pancake, fried eggs fried hard, bacon cooked hard, hot lumpy grits.  That's the kind of old fashioned breakfast I like and that's exactly what I received when I dined at \"The Cracked Egg\".    My boyfriend and I tried The Cracked Egg after leaving GCU at 8am in the morning.  I noticed the huge sign on the outside window for a special for $5.99.  Since it's an old fashioned diner I figured the special was for seniors so I didn't bother paying much attention to it.    We entered and seated immediately.  We weren't extremely hungry so we decided to share a meal.  We were going share a 2 piece pancake combo with pork sausage, hash browns and eggs and an extra order of turkey sausage.  The waitress wrote our order down but then said, \"Hey we're running a special.  2 pancakes, 2 eggs, hash browns and a meat for 5.99 before 10am\".  WHAT?!  That's exactly what we were about to order with the addition of the extra meat but for way more money.  SO ... the special we ordered!  Everything was perfect.  Between the two of us we were not able to finish the pancakes and hash browns. The portions were huge.  Will definitely return!",

It was a lot more chocolate than banana than I'd like but they were good.   The service was great, as was the iced tea!  One of my biggest complaints is that the iced tea tastes rancid. I was pleasantly surprised and found that the iced tea was good too.   Overall, it was a good experience. I would definitely go back to try other items on the menu.

Aproaching the establishment from the spacious unfilled parking lot and trying not to judge from looks I had the distinct feeling that I was not going to have a 4 star experience. The wait staff was very helpful and attentive but the omelette that I ordered looked precooked and reheated and was lacking flavor. The substance that accompanied the pancakes had the appearance of butter but that was all and the syrup must have been HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP with maple coloring. The pancakes required a fork and knife to cut through them. The best that can be said is that they were tasteless. My son, enjoyed his bacon and home fries, but stopped after one bite of his 3 stack which he typically devours. I cannot trust the YELP reviews. This is not the first time this has happened.",

Gravy though was normal sausage gravy, pleasant not rave worthy.   My husband ordered the \"cowboy burrito\" he's a major lover of chicken fried steak, his go to, always and forever. This burrito is packed with eggs, chicken fried steak, and cheese, TONS of cheese, smothered in sausage gravy and topped with green onions and more cheese. Can't lie, his was realllly good if you like some fried cheesey goodness, get it. But his side of \"home fries\" we were mushed, unseasoned, hash browns.  Our son and daughter got pancakes, and French toast, both good, I'm not a big sweets person but my husband tried both  and said the French toast was a lot better then pancakes!   Employees were very kind and attentive, it definitely has a welcoming feel.   This isn't a awful place, but not a place I'd crave to come back to. Come on guys, rock solid biscuits?

The waitress is lucky to remember which shoe goes which foot as she writes down order but cannot seem to get it right, at least for 2 visits total by us. The special was terrible and biscuits with other it were rocks. Also we were told when explaining food, that was barely touched, was very bad and we would like it removed from bill, we were told they had a 3 bite rule.....Although hilarious, the waitress was serious. For us, this was terrible. But if you have young kids who cannot seem to keep quiet, this is perfect as it gets so loud that it really won't matter and they get Mickey Mouse pancakes. So if ya keep it simple for you and low expectations then give it a shot",

My waitress was polite and useful in the fact that she understood and tasted the dishes off the menu herself, which helped me narrow down my decision. I ordered the Ribeye Benedict, a classic with a side of deep fried diced potatoes. My body quivered with pleasure instantaneously as my first bite went in. I was hit with 5 different flavors throughout my journey and was delighted with every gulp. I was amazed with how many of my body parts were affected from the foods deliciousness. From tongue to toe, my blood rushed. Now, as much as my experience was great I have to give this place 3 stars because $5 dollars for a glass of OJ is O.D. leaving all my emotions and erection at the door because I was pretty turned off and won't come back.",

Although it was cute when we walked in and sat at the checked counter, the service - while friendly - was almost as bad as the food. You expect a diner to be quick - especially at the counter. This one was not. And we could see our food sitting on the warmers for a few minutes before it came to our counter seats.   Once it arrived, however, we sort of wished it hadn't. The chocolate chip waffle was flavorless except for the chocolate and so soggy I could barely get a bite down.   A country Benedict was poorly cooked, the biscuit doughy and the \"poached\" eggs practically hard boiled. The gravy wasn't bad, but nothing could save the dish as a whole - especially given the bland, barely fried portion of limp hash browns that came out on the plate as a side.   We also ordered the BLT on sourdough which came with crinkle cut fries. Although a crinkle cut usually gives a fry more crevices to become crisp and salty, these fries were neither. A soggy pile of flavorless potatoes, I think frozen fries cooked at home in the microwave could have turned out just as well. And the bacon was fatty - and not in a good way. More like in the way that indicates to you the bacon was cheap and poor quality. And that was probably the best of our dishes!  We were eager to leave after this breakfast but, again, we had to wait some time to close out, which was frustrating given how close we were to the cash register. Now that we're gone, we certainly won't be back.",

My friend ordered a ham and cheddar cheese omlet. It had American sliced cheese on the top and her potatoes weren't cooked either. She didn't eat it at all.

I like this place because it doesn't hurt the pockets(not expensive) and the food is good! I call it a \"Hidden Gem\" a place most people pass by but probably should stop and try it out! I love that every time I go I'm greeted as soon as I walk-in with a \"hello\" or \" how can I help you\". That's great customer service I hate going to places and they don't greet you or are too busy to acknowledge your presence! So I give them A+ for that right off the bat. Theresa was our waitress and she was cool. She had small talk with us and then stated she would allow us to look at the menu first. The only knock I had about today's experience was that she left and came right back....... I wasn't ready *Kevin Hart Voice* so since my sister placed her order being greedy haha! I went ahead and placed mine but with a little more time I would have tried something else. So I decided to get the banana nut pancakes with scrambled egg whites and turkey sausage trying to \"keep it sexy\" aka healthy. The meal came out great.. my food was hot.. and didn't have to wait long. Now if I had more time I would have tried a omelette I have seen other guests get their omelettes and they look great!  Breakfast is usually busy but I have never had to wait long to be seated or greeted. Overall I like this place and will continue to go back and hopefully will try a omelette next time! No I will try that omelette *speak it into existence*",

The second time made me believe it's a regular thing, which it probably might be, according to the other reviews. Cmon, when the word 'egg' is in your title AND you're a breakfast place...  It's a shame because the chorizo eggs Benedict was very flavorful.   Service is generally very good and the area is clean despite the hustle and bustle.",

The wait staff were very friendly and nice and the place looks like an old diner decorated with vintage style signage.  The waitress was a sweet older lady that was very attentive to helping our party of 5.    Then came the food....my friends ham looked and tasted as if it were rubber and might have been a little undercooked. I myself ordered the Blu Cheese Burger.  When my order came out the fries were the cafeteria type and not very tasty.  The burger lettuce was yellow and the tomato looked tired. I thought to myself, I can move that to the side and just just eat as it.  When I bit the burger, it tasted like really stale cheese....yuck...four hours later I still have the after taste in my tongue. I think they are trying, but idk if I will come back.",

I had a chorizo skillet with corned beef hash on the side. Lashings of coffee, iced water and toast rounded out a veritable feast. Inexpensive to boot. Doubly so as we won't need dinner tonight !

The atmosphere is nice, there's a good discount for GCU students, and the menu offers a wide variety to satisfy your breakfast craving.

The bacon was mainly fat. The eggs Benedict I had was actually pretty good but the potato chunks that were served with it were literally just friend potato chunks with 0 seasoning.

My friend got the Spinich Florentine. Food was delicious. French toast was nice and thick did not taste like egg which was great. I tried the house fries from my friends plate, they were missing something or might have just been undercooked. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Prices were reasonable for the order. Defiantly going to come back and try something different on the menu.",

    "text": "We found Cracked Egg on apple Maps for close breakfast places. With a name like Cracked Egg, we thought this would be a trendy new breakfast place similar to \"Snooze\", \"Over-Easy\", or Cured Ham.\" When we pulled up we realized it was a pretty old place with very little done for design or any upkeep. The inside looks like an out-of-date Denny's... and that is not saying much since all Denny's look out-of-date already. This is the look we would expect from a 1 star Chinese buffet.  We got seated quickly despite being pretty busy and had our waitress take our drink order within a couple of minutes. I love good service. I noticed that all the menu's said all the coffee served was \"100% Guatemalan Coffee\" so we ordered two cups. Nothing about what we drank was exotic nor originating any further south than Mesa. When I asked the waitress the blend of the coffee, she just indicated that it was a cheap house blend and not from Guatemala. After our drinks, the waitress took our order pretty quickly, I ordered Eggs Benedict and my girlfriend ordered Country Fried Steak, both with potatoes, hers with toast.  At first appearance, it looked like the cook was limited to only ingredients what were brown, light brown, or off-white. Nothing appealing about how our dishes looked. A pop of color from fresh herbs or onions or tomatoes  or hell, even garnish would have made this plate look less like an Oliver Twist meal and more like a $20 per person meal.  My Eggs Benedict came with hard boiled yolks (see picture). Immediate turn off. The Country fried steak was dried out and a mess. The menu described the gravy as \"Sausage Gravy\" but we were hard pressed to find any remnants of sausage, nor any flavor of sausage. It tasted like milk and flour with pepper.  Salt... that is what this meal needed to start with. None of my Country Potatoes nor my GF's Breakfast hash had any seasoning. No salt, no pepper, no herbs, no anything really. My breakfast potatoes bored my tastebuds within the first bite. The potato pieces could easily be mistaken for croutons. No party in my mouth from this place with those potatoes.  Overall, the service is great and impressive, the wait staff takes the time to make sure you have everything and the tag team of servers ensured that we got all our food quickly. The food needs help. DESPERATE help. The blandness of all the food may appeal to the elderly regeneration, but for the increasing foodies population, the experience just begs to have more. The visual appearance of the meal is pretty bland, followed by no seasoning, improper egg techniques and overall, BORING appearance. Food should be an experience not just a necessity. This place would have been great during the depression when the act of receiving food was enough, but in this modern age of taste and abundant choices, this place really falls behind.  The menu needs a serious overhaul, the cooks need to not be afraid of using fresh ingredients, herbs, and seasonings, the owner has to want to be relevant within the restaurant industry and the interior needs help... Bad help.  If you are looking for comfort food with no regard of palate, then this is the place, if you think that a $40 breakfast for two should have something redeeming, this is not the place. The only reasons why it didn't get one star, is because the service was decent.",

The amount of ingredients and the freshness of them was absolutely superb.  I'm so glad I swapped the suggested cheese with American.  This is the first skillet that I've had in Arizona that I truly look forward to eating again.   I got the biscuit with it.  The biscuit was about as big as a softball.   It was moist and tender and very good with butter and jelly! Yum!   If we lived closer I'd be there every weekend, without question.  I hope to get back at least once a month.",

    "text": "Save your $, save your time.  Pancakes and hollandaise are *divine*, however; 3 visits all had substantial issues with no response from restaurant.   1st visit: Midweek, approx 1. 3pm Staff recommended biscuit/gravy as big seller. While the coffee was amazing, the beautiful biscuit I received was hard-working and gravy so think you could pull the biscuit out from underneathand the biscuit was dry, no evidence of gravy having been on it. But: Made excuse for them, thought I'd try another time.  2nd visit: Seated alone next to large table that voiced multiple problems to their server. Decided midweek morning might not be good time, so made another excuse for them, decided to try Sunday breakfast.  3rd visit: Mom enjoyed her breakfast, but noticed how horrid the omelette they served me was. Asked server before ordering if the omlettes were made flat/hard like a bi or tri fold wallet, and she said no, they had an egg cook who shakes the pan to make it light/fluffy/airy with no overcooking . SOLD!  Alas, what was delivered to me looked like a small 2 egg piece of dried matting. Dry. Crispy. Dark brown spots from overcooking. Made like...a bi-fold wallet. Exactly like she said it wouldn't  be made. Wife's potatoes looked like cut up seasoned potato wedges, but my potatoes looked like they were made with a press and cut with a pastry roller: Burnt (black, on one half of it ... hot grill?), pressed flat to about 1/2\" and dry/unseasoned. Burnt top peeled off to reveal almost nothing.   And omelette so cold it didn't melt the American cheese on the bottom of the plate, which slid out in one single unmelted slice.   Coffee: First cup glorious.  Coffee: Second cup lukewarm Coffee: 3rd cup = undrinkable bitterness, like grounds left to drain acid over carafe for hours.  One skillet breakfast,  One omelette w/hollandaise & pancake. 2 coffees. = $38 before tip.  Don't know if owner is on vacation, but we've tried to contact them with no avail, hence this post finally. Son & family moved in nearby, thought this place might be worthy of you could find the \"sweet spot\" perhaps.  Servers don't do their sidework (empty salt/hot sauce bottles);  Expediter doesn't know how to expedite, not what to look for.  Cooks seem to be willing to \"get away\" with what they can.  If restaurant ever decides to respond, I'll try to amend the review.  Unfortunately however, while these folks *seem* to be set up wonderfully, I'd avoid it like the plague.",

We walked in and were seated in a timely manner. The waitress come over gave us menus and asked for our drink selection. All we ordered at that time was water. As we sat there and sat there and sat there, our waitress helped 3 other tables. Then she noticed I was making eye contact with her. She acknowledged me by saying sorry, there was no \"I'll be right with you or give me a minute\". She said sorry and turned and walked the other way. She then proceeded to grab the coffee pot and refill the other customers.   I am of the pacific Island decent and my companion is Native American, we have dark skin and are always mistaken for Hispanics. We know there is a huge American vs Mexican deal in Arizona and maybe this was the case. We stood up and walked out, no one came after us to try to recover any our business.   So, I would not recommend this place if you are not of the Caucasian decent cause the treat you worse than dogs.   Good luck if you go here to enjoy a meal",

My only complaint is that the space between the table and the booth is really narrow so I felt a bit claustrophobic. We ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes, chicken fried steak skillet and a side of biscuits and gravy since we saw so many reviews mention them. (We weren't going for healthy today, obviously!) My pancakes were delicious! I would have taken a picture, but the waitress accidentally spilled the syrup all over them so it wasn't the most attractive presentation. My husband really enjoyed his skillet and the biscuits and gravy were enormous! Definitely large portions, so much I think my hubby and I could have split something if we had similar taste in food haha. (One area we don't really agree on- ordering a pizza with him is a nightmare lol!) The staff was really friendly and I never had to wait for coffee refills or even request them, which is really nice. They do have a lot of healthy options on their menu too which is really nice. Definitely a nice little breakfast/brunch find in our area!",

It still looks the same, but - with their rebranding as a \"breakfast spot\" - they seem to have increased their prices significantly, to the point where it is among the most expensive breakfast places in the area (I mean, $9,50 for ham and eggs?)  Their lunch menu has also increased in price, and is fairly limited.   Yet they still draw huge crowds at weekend breakfast hours, which seems to overwhelm the otherwise-very capable staff. It can also affect the quality of the food, which is usually good but occasional problems with cold items, not properly cooked, etc. I have gone elsewhere, save about 20% off their prices, no waits, better service and food cooked properly.",

It looked like a manager who brought our food out to us. He drops it off without asking does everything look correct? So had to wait 15 minutes to flag waitress down to tell her we didn't get avocado or toast with his meal then my baby syrup covered like half my pancakes. By the time he got his avocado slices he was done with his meal. No apology or taken off. Food wasn't great or special so we will not be back or recommend.",

Host is super friendly, I live less then 5 blocks from this place so we wish we could go more often then we do, but everytime we go, we remember why we don't. The servers are cranky, and slow, they forget half of your order and if they think your a new face they lie to you and tell you that they are new and they are sorry,  I've came here a handful of times in the 2yrs I've lived here, and its the same thing everytime. I'm a server myself and I try to be understanding of somebody else's circumstances, but all I can come up with in this place is that these ladies are bitter, old, and stretched far too thin, I'm gay so its not about the looks trust me, but a little personality, sense of urgency, and a side of manners go a long way. Guys its time to let some of these ladies retire and hire more servers to handle the work load that they apparently can't handle without being weeded. I'm here right now and this lady has 3 tables, me included, and she's running around like she has 15 tables. I get it, they are old and need the work, but bring in help for them at least and put more on the floor, because your service is lacking for it.",

We were greeted by a friendly waitress, Dorothy, whom seated us promptly.  We were each handed a menu that is quite extensive with both breakfast and lunch items in which to choose from. My husband chose the Western Scramble, with an English muffin, and I chose the Californian Eggs Benedict with crispy hash browns, and coffee and ice water for both of us.  We didn't have to wait long before the food arrived at our table. The food was hot, and fresh. You can tell that this restaurant chooses and uses only the finest and freshest ingredients.  Dorothy, our waitress, was excellent. She checked on us frequently and always made sure she topped off our coffee. She was friendly and helpful. At the end of our meal, she asked us if we would like a free scoop of ice cream. They have vanilla, chocolate or strawberry. Its the \"REAL\" deal, not out of a machine. The ice cream was perfect. We will definitely be back to this restaurant. It is a wonderful place to eat and it is family owned and operated.",

But other than that I absolutely love it I have Michelle as a waitress every time and she is absolutely fantastic always :-) and happy and getting our order right.

The establishment is family owned and operated, this is not your typical upscale restaurant, however, if these walls could talk I am sure they would have some great stories behind all the happy smiles. Trisha was my server and was on top of everything, always updated on my order without me asking. I highly recommend this place.",

Unfortunately, I was super dehydrated from a kick-butt concert the night before and wasn't able to eat much.

Please wait to be seated, gives you the opportunity to take everything in and reflect back to a simpliar era.  Clean and comfortable booths with tables for larger crowds. I found myself still wanting to sit at the counter stools like I did as a child in a drug store soda fountain.  I saved the best for last. The food is by far the best diner food for the price.

Best biscuits 'n gravy around! We also ordered the Cowboys Skillet which was another winner. Potatoes were so good,  spicy and flavorful.  Generous portions and absolutely delicious.

The fried potato were bad. And they slightly tasted of freezer burn. I did not finish them. And I will not be taking them home.  The omelette was excellent it was best thing I had for my meal. The sourdough toast I told her to put extra butter on it and she did. That was great! However it is it highly of salt so I guess I should've asked for non-salted butter. The biscuits and gravy where OK. The gravy was good but the biscuits were hard as rocks. Hard to cut into. They crumble when I would try to eat them. Did expect a little bit better for the biscuit and gravy due to the reviews that I read about them. Showed the consistency of the biscuits and gravy to the waitress and she replace them for me.  The second time around was better :-) restroom cleanliness was ok. Could be better. No handicap restroom. Hmmm.... overall not bad. I'll go back for their excellent customer service and great prices!!",

The owner Luke is never there. Apparently when you call in or ask to speak to Luke he is never available. He likes to pop in and out . The service problem is not only the staff, but the cooks can't even get two separate orders out at the same time to the same table. So if plan on eating with the people you dine with,you best call in your order before you arrive. My girlfriend & I went to dine in last Thursday, she order the breakfast I order a simple blt, bacon lettuce turkey sandwich with fries. My girlfriend got here's first , it took the kitchen 10 more minutes before mine came out. Who in there right mind serves two meals separate at the same table? The cracked egged does. 3 thumbs down on this business if that's what you want call it. More like crashed egged!!! Do not stop eat or even wash your hands here. Stay clear away from here if you value your health!!!!!",

It was my first time at a breakfast place and this is what youd expect after watching alot of 80s and 90s movies that have diners. it seems really authentic and just \"diner\" is a good word for it. The food is very close to home, u know, the whole, scrambled eggs, toast, bacon, and it overall made the breakfast experience greater because it was so familiar...

(previous experiences) this last visit May24 We decided to bring all my family that was visiting from California to have  a \"Good breakfast\" first of all we get a server that seem like she had a rough night ..not the usual server .. fresh attentive .. First of all when she brings our coffees I noticed my cup has BRiGHT red lipstick stains ..How can you miss that .. when you are serving a fresh cup of coffee?? just that grossed me out but I was ok with her exchanging my cup .. second she brings the toast.. for everyone in the table .. well our toast was filled with mold ..yes MOLD .. the people that are preparing the food have to be blind to miss the mold when spreading butter on it .!! Honestly the server didn't seem shocked just took the bread came back with more bread -and whispered sorry and continue serving .. Food didn't have any flavor no salt no pepper no nothing .. I was embarrassed that I brought my family here ..  nobody (Manager) bother to come to our table and apologize.. they just brought the ticket back making sure the 18%gratuity was included for 6 of us.. I don't mind the tip if it was a good service and enjoyed the food .. Is just that  this time there was no reason to tip ...  keep your eyes open.. this experience got me thinking how many times we've been to this place and wanted to vomit inside my mouth ..",

    "text": "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 20 years and have eaten here when it was Fast Eddies. I never really liked that restaurant, but I'm a breakfast guy and with the change, I wanted to try it. The service was good and they took my order very quickly. I love chorizo and eggs and I'm very particular about how they prepare the chorizo. This was the best chorizo I've had. It was crispy, not greasy and had the perfect amount of spice. Best I've had anywhere! Also to top it off, they had French vanilla creamer to go with my coffee. I'm very particular about that as well. I'm excited to try another dish on my next visit.",

    "text": "Service deserves a 5 star! Our server was an older woman and was on top of it! Coffee was refilled, check-ins were timed appropriately and knowledgable with the menu and gave us options with salsas.  The portions were perfect for the prices that we paid, and the taste was actually pretty good! I have to say that I preferred their potatoes over Matt's big breakfast because they were toasted evenly throughout (not burnt on one side) - they could have been seasoned more but regardless, they were good. The eggs were cooked perfectly and they tasted like real eggs, the hashbrowns were plentiful and again a decent sized portion. I had the Belgian waffle and my husband had the pancakes both were good - we've had better but they were decent. For it being a last minute decision we were very happy with this restaurant for breakfast. It definitely felt like the neighborhood restaurant - homely feel. :)",
