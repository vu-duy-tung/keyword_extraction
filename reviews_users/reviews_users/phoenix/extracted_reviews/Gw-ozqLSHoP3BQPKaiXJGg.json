I will definitely go back because of the atmosphere and I want to try out the boat ride. The waiter provided good service too.",

The waiter was slow to begin with and our order was taken about 30 minutes after we arrived. We still did not have our food two hours after we were there. We are still waiting on our second round of drinks also. We saw one table get food within the two hours we were there and they were served at different times. Clearly management needs to fix many things at this establishment. It definitely will be a Mother's Day to Remember. Off to McDonald's we go.",

I have had two dishes from this place (tenderloin sandwich and fish tacos) and the food is just average at best.  I think some of the drink and food items are overpriced.    However, the scenery is outstanding and the customer service has been great for me.  They also have some great craft beers on tap.  I would recommend that you sit outside on the water and get a craft beer during happy hour or reverse happy hour.  I will continue to come here because of the customer service, view/location, reverse happy hour, and quality craft beer.  It's also a nice place to play Cornhole outside.",

Tried the door and it was open, but the place was empty. Minutes later a waiter lead us to a table. We were told that the only breakfast or lunch option was a buffet. No price was given to us, not even menus. We had to wait 20 minutes for the buffet to be ready, and when we got to the buffet l, all the food looked raw and not appetizing. Plates were also still wet, hadn't even been dried off. We get back to the table, and the food was ice cold and undercooked. We asked for the check and was surprised to see it was  $20 a person. Ridiculous. Paid $100 for five people for gross food. Very disappointed. Our server was kind but the lack of information about the price of the buffet and the overall lack of enthusiasm of the staff made it hard to feel welcome in an empty restaurant and did not want us coming back for more. Won't be returning.",

    "text": "I use Yelp all the time to research restaurants and always think of writing a review myself but never have. Last night I had such a poor experience I felt compelled to share it, so alas, my first review.  The only good things about this meal were my date, the atmosphere, and the glass of Sauvignon Blanc I got. When we sat down, I asked the waitress about their white sangria and whether it was super sweet (since some are more than others). She looked at me like I was insane and a nuisance and we had this very awkward exchange. She said she had no idea what it tastes like. I think if you work at a restaurant you should at least be knowledgable about the general taste of things. She offered to get me a sample, but again, she made me feel like such an inconvenience I did not take her up on that, although now I wish I had. Needless to say, I ordered the sangria and it was basically sweetened water (aka no alcohol, I swear). I finally had to ask her for water because she never brought it and we were dying of thirst considering we're in summer temps now. As my date put it, the waitress had the personality of a rock.   Now, onto the food. Oh my gosh, save your $80 (how much our meal was before tip). I think the atmosphere here is very cool and this is a great spot to go for a drink (just not the sangria) but go elsewhere for food. We shared the shrimp cocktail, jambalaya, and ahi tuna salad.   Where do I begin? We asked for the shrimp cocktail to come out first, plus it's an appetizer so it should anyway. The shrimp cocktail arrived just a couple minutes before everything else so we got this onslaught of mediocre food at once. The shrimp cocktail wasn't that fresh but it was better than the rest of the food. The jambalaya was nothing like jambalaya I've had before. It looked and tasted more like spiced-up Rice-A-Roni with only a few pieces of chicken, andouille sausage, and shrimp. It was not what you think you're getting when you order cajun food. Now, the salad was the worst. The ahi tuna was tough and did NOT seem safe to eat. We both agreed the texture and taste was very off. The salad was supposed to have avocados and didn't, and the tomatoes were not fresh -- even though we are in tomato season! Finally, the wasabi-ginger dressing was super weird and reminded me of the taste of a Christmas cookie with nutmeg.  Usually I tell the server if the food is this bad, but I guess I chickened out and just didn't have the heart. Which is silly considering the waitress did not check in on us to see how the food was and didn't pick up on the fact we may not have enjoyed it since there was a TON of food left on every plate. You'd think someone would see that and ask if something was wrong. I felt horrible my date paid that much for a meal that left me feeling like I wanted another meal after, since I probably ate a total of five bites. We won't be going back here except for a drink and the vibe. It's a shame that a place with such a cool location on the water and an alluring atmosphere has such poor service and food.",

The prices were a bit high, but worth how good the drinks were! The jolly man was awesome!! I also had a couple different food items, the queso is a joke. It's melted shredded cheese on a thin tiny skillet with meat, very oily, hard and not very satisfying. The shredded tacos were dry and bland and the shrimp Ceasar salad had such a weird after taste I just wasted it. The staff was great! At first I thought our waitress was texting in front of us but realized she was taking our orders! I will definitely be back for the drinks, but not order any food.",

It was adorable and perfect for our event. The GM was extremely accommodating of all our special requests including guests with specific food preferences and allergies. Our party had ample staffing and every one who we came in contact with had excellent customer service skills and treated our guests to prompt and efficient service.  We had a limited menu that mostly included small bites, desserts, and drinks. Everything I tried was fabulous including the sliders and bruschetta. They also had a great beer and wine selection and from what I heard made excellent cocktails for our guests who were enjoying them.  My team hosted an event inside the restaurant earlier this ear which included plated meals from a limited menu. On this occasion the food was great, however the service and leadership were clearly lacking. We decided to give it another try anyway and were pleased to find a brand new staff and a new GM for our second event. To top the night off the GM came out and offered to take our guests out on the boat for a tour. If you been here before weren't impressed, give it another try! They have really stepped up their game!!",

Food was cold I  got a grilled cheese with the cheese not melted and cold, HOW DO YOU MESS THIS UP. I had to send it back. We had a new waiter who obviously wasn't trained or had any guidance from the very present manager of the facility. The service was horrible even for the poor attempt the new guy made to keep his head above water with the total of 3 tables he had.... slow service for 10 people serving 4 total tables which i am Told is the normal here. Everyone around us was unhappy. Food sucked, drinks sucked, service sucked. Never again.",

We came here for the after party for the IT movie premier. The owners son was the little boy in the movie. That was pretty cool. Food was just ok my fish was pretty bland but the flat bread my friends got looked pretty good. Def a great date place. Check it out just for the awesome atmosphere.

    "text": "This is my 2nd time reviewing this place.  I won't go into all the details of the establishment, but really just focus on 1 of the employees.  I have been a regular at this place since it reopened quite a few years back, so I have seen and interacted with this man quite a few times.  I feel my opinion of him at this point is rather just.    There is one shaggy haired bartender who has been there since the place opened.  He has never been particularly good.  He is rather slow at making drinks, so when it's even slightly busy, drinks take an exceptionally long time.  He also has absolutely zero sense of urgency.  He always moves at the same lethargic pace, which is at about a 3 out of 10, and that's being generous.     He is also rather unpleasant to look at.  His clothes are more than often unkempt, and his hair and facial hair don't add any sense of cleanliness to his overall appearance.  I certainly don't need supermodel bartenders, but I don't like feeling like my drinks are dirty either.    To top off this gem of a worker, he routinely has one of the least pleasant attitudes of anybody I encounter.  He has personally given me nasty and snide comments on a consistent basis.  Doing it even once I would consider unacceptable but it happens more often than not when he is working.  His poor attitude is not only just in his choice of words, but is also conveyed through his body language and his propensity to completely ignore patrons who are at the bar.  Most of my friends, male and female, who have dealt with him have shared similar sentiments.    I'm disgusted and turned off when I walk in and notice he is working, and I can say that he is one of the reasons I don't go to the Watershed more often.    I look forward to the day when he no longer works there",

The menu was great and drink specials were awesome too. We got the DIY mimosas for 15$. It comes with a bottle of champagne and your choice of juice. We got cranberry and pineapple for our mimosas. Super yummy! For food we ordered mahi mahi fish tacos, tri tip sandwich with au ju and delicious crispy French fries, and a berry salad with seared ahi which was to die for! The atmosphere was wonderful, they even had live music at the bar. For the cooler seasons they have a little fire pit on the patio right in the water. We loved the captains lounge which has sofas, a pool table, and life size jenga. There's also a patio where you can play darts. Such a fun place. Can't wait to come back!",

After asking different servers over 5 times for napkins and silverware over the course of 30min i went inside to get some. I also asked about a friends meal that hadn't yet arrived. They order over 40min before and were last to their meal, a chicken wrap. When i asked why the guy i spoke to said well its Friday night.

    "text": "I should have read the reviews before we came here.  I love Happy Hour, and I love places that give you time to enjoy happy hour which is why we chose to visit the Watershed on a Friday night.  The location is awesome, right on the water with amazing views of the sunset.  The place is huge and would be a great venue for a special event like a wedding or birthday.   We arrived a few min after 6 PM and already the patio is full up, we were quoted a 30 min wait. I hate pointing out empty tables, there were several on the patio, so we chose to sit inside instead.  We're hungry, right?  The waitress says she can't seat us yet (even though the place is empty) and suggests we go to the bar first for a drink.  Ummm, ok?  We get to the bar and are promptly greeted by the bartender (battery operated motorized wine openers, really? Is it that hard your need a machine to do it for you?)  We order off the happy hour menu only to find out they are out of Sangria.  Out?  At 6:10 PM on a Friday?  By now the hostess finally got things figured out and we are seated.  We are seated and try to order drinks again with our server but guess what, they are out of Frozen drinks!  I order a regular drink and the boy orders a beer, both on happy hour and in stock. By now, we've been in the establishment for 20 min with no drinks, not even water.  We decide to start with the Chilli Cheese fries which comes with your choice of Chili or Chile, see what they did there?  Except we weren't given a choice, our server disappeared and we got Chili fries which were 70% beans.  The Boy was dying to try to their Green Chile Meatloaf Double Double and it was amazing!  He was so happy with the side of veggie upgrade told me to quote him in this review \"Peppers, Onions, Zucchini, usually they do some played out, lame, broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix but this is really good.\"  I am not a green chili fan and I had a bite and it was indeed, really, really, good!  I ordered the calamari which was just meh and was served cold, not fresh out of the fryer.  Here comes where I should have read the other reviews.  It took almost 45 minutes for us to get our meal and this place was no where even close to busy. This is 45 min after we got our appetizer.  I could have sent my cold calamari back but I wasn't sure how long it would take for me to get a refire.  I noticed other tables who had been seated since we got in finally getting their entrees after a long wait.  This is not good.  Things were good, but there were so many timing issues and things being out of stock.  Come here for the view (and the Green Chile Meatloaf) but don't come if you are hungry.",

Based off that I was nervous about coming but wanted to support the fundraiser event. I really wished I had went with my gut instinct because eight now my tummy would not be hurting. We sat at a table with 2 other families we knew. It took over an hour for 1 party's food to come out it also took 2 waitress's to get some mayo. The other party's burger was cold and they forgot to put bacon on it. $12 for chicken nachos the chicken wasn't even seasoned. The kitchen was slow getting the food out I felt bad for the waitress she just kept apologizing. We had 2 kids at the table we got kids menus after we had ordered for them off the regular menu which we had to ask for because they only gave us the limited menu. I will not come back, they have spider webs by the fountain and by where our table was. The view was pretty it has the potential to be a nice place but they really need to read the negative comments and fix those problems. They ruined a lot of people's mother's day. I regret going it was a waste of my money.",

    "text": "So I took my mother here for Mother's Day with a reservation, needless to say we stopped at Wendy's afterwards.   So we came in before our reservation time and the hostess told us where we were supposed to be and I asked if there was any chance we could be outside on the patio we would wait longer she said \"I'll see what I can do\". So we go to the bar and get drinks while we wait and table is ready before the drinks are but she says I wasn't able to get you outside. This is where I start to get pissed, there's 10+ tables out there that are empty and stayed empty our whole visit. We looked at the menu online and figured out what we wanted beforehand but found out that they had only a selected menu that was 8 different items all at least $20 except desserts. I begrudgingly ordered the grilled salmon, BIG MISTAKE! So it came out super fast and I was thinking this looks tiny(didn't say how big the portion was on the menu) I thought it was a fillet of fish but it was fillet mingon size. I'm like I can't believe I paid $22 for this tiny fish at least at other restaurants that charge that have better service. I cut it open and ITS RAW INSIDE! I sit there for 10 minutes before my server comes and asks how I like it. I nicely asked can it be cooked more and she says oh yes I'm sorry and takes it back. By the time it comes back my mom has finished her food (which she says was okay) but I have to use her silverware since my new fish has none and the waitress ran off again. I paid the check and left. On my way out I was tempted to say to the hostess, \"who do I have to screw to get a table outside?\"   I feel that since we didn't wear our super expensive clothes that we didn't get outside since it was obvious that all the customers out there were wealthy.   I would only recommend this place for drinks because the bartender was great.",

When I complained, the waitress did offer to replace it, but when we explained we didn't have time to wait for a new entree, she made no offer to refund us on that aspect of the order. The manager never came to our table to express concern or offer to comp us the entree.   Bottom line? It's an inferior-quality sports bar with a killer view. We will NOT be back!",

    "text": "The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the location is AWESOME and the hostess was an absolute gem! I have been here a few times, again because the patio is stellar. The first time my food was awesome, I had a grilled cheese with sauteed mushrooms and onions. Everytime else has been VERY lacking.   First I would like to mention if in your two years of being open I have never seen the same menu twice perhaps that is something that needs immediate attention. This particular time really irked me. They just rolled out their new menu which seemed okay at best, but way over priced once the food came out. I ordered \"beef and pork tacos\" off their happy hour menu, which only is one food item each day. The tacos came out with, I kid you not, meat and tortilla, NOTHING else. The lady next to me ordered tacos as well chicken and she at least had cheese on hers. They had a pinch full of shredded lettuce and I counted 4 pieces of diced tomato on the side, which wasn't even enough to put on two tacos as small as they were. When the server returned a long time later I asked if this was how the tacos were intended to be served AKA with meat and tortilla. His response was, it is off the happy hour menu, as if that means it shouldn't have standard taco ingredients. The other lady asked if we could at least get some salsa to put on it since the meat was SUPER dry. Again a very long wait later he returned. I had actually eaten most of my taco since I figured he had forgotten.   Someone at the table had ordered a moscow mule as well and it was almost clear. Last time I checked they had ginger beer which is ginger colored. I tried a sip, it was awful!  Seriously Watershed you are so lucky your location is awesome and I have friends that can walk to this place because really you are getting worse by the minute. I will not even return with friends at this point.",

It was about half full and our waitress was great when she was around. The queso was good, the drinks were tasty, and the entrees were ok, but nothing fantastic.   My second visit was for Sunday brunch. The sign said to seat ourselves but the hostess followed us around, clearly trying to guide us to where she wanted us to sit. The brunch buffet is $19 and not worth it. Service was slow, drinks from the bar were slower, and my friend's made to order omelet took nearly 20 minutes to arrive.   I will not be returning for a third visit any time soon.",

The views of the lake and the homes around it are breathtaking. The hostesses, servers and bartenders are extremely friendly and constantly check back to see it you need anything else. The Happy Hour is one of the best around with 2 for1 drinks. Their HH Specials are delicious as well as the regular menu. Especially the mahi mahi. We will return again. Next time for the $5.00 boat ride around the lake and some more good food.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been coming here since the grand opening and although the servers are great and are always trying to do what they can to make it enjoyable the management is always coming up with excuses as to why food takes so long to get delivered and try to shortcut the \"discounts\" they have given us for the inconvenience. Last time we were here we waited an hour and forty five minutes for NACHOS! Then they offered a discount and gave us ONE round of drinks for free when everything else was five times the cost. They gave us a \"free appetizer\" gift card for our next visit which when we tried to use, they tried to say was only good for the cheapest item we purchased when I specifically told them I wanted the free appetizer to be applied to the nachos we ordered again in good faith. Give this place a year to get their act together and the view and food might be worth it but at this point we have gone from frequent customers to disgusted patrons. Don't waste your time  UPDATE: After this review the GM was more than helpful and personally addressed this issue. The experience was frustrating but it was just a perfect storm and nobody is perfect. We have been back a few times since this first review and the service and food has been top notch!",

We arrived and got seated immediately by the wonderful hostess, who was followed by the owner's young daughter (cutest kid I've ever seen!). The hostess was wonderful and made sure to answer questions about the happy hour that was currently going on.   Here comes the shit show.  After maybe 10 minutes, our server arrives looking as though she is in a huge rush when we are one of three tables in the whole establishment. My date and I order sangria, figuring it is probably fresh. Nope... Tasted like an alcoholic Shirley Temple, it was so sweet. Switched mine out for The Velvet Devil merlot, which was excellent.  We order chips and salsa, which came out cold, and finally when our server came back to check on us, we ordered our meal. Date ordered a burger, I got the Thai curry bowl with shrimp. Did I mention they take orders from their cell phones? I thought when we were ordering, our waitress was ignoring us. It was the most awkward interaction I've ever had at a place like this. Luckily the lakeside view distracted us enough to not give a shit about the terrible service.   Food came out. Pretty good, not something to rave about. The Thai curry came with slices of tomatoes which I thought was a little weird, but other than that, I enjoyed the meal. After about twenty minutes, our server comes back and says to my date, \"oops, forgot to ask if you wanted ketchup,\" laughs, and walks away. Luckily he didn't but what the hell...?!   All in all, a pretty awkward experience and probably won't be back. Get your shit together, Watershed. Way too gorgeous of a location to have mediocre service and food like this.",

They had other reservations but they still were nice enough to seat us on the water like we requested in the reservation for open table. Great waitress, got our wine/beer immediately. Happy hour was $2 off wine. Got our app's right away and our entrees very fast! Nachos and Greek Pasta w/ Salmon were great. Something changed last night and we were VERY happy about it. They really redeemed themselves and I hope they keep up this service. Great job last night guys and keep it up so we can keep coming back here!!! ;)",

The interior lacked the \"umph\" needed for a place with such a great view. Wobbly tables, the lack of decor and the plethora of dust and cob webs that line the ceiling give this place a dumpy feel. My husband wanted pretzel bites w their own cheese and they tasted as if they were microwaved and the cheese tasted as if it came straight from the can. I had the fresh ahi tuna on top of a salad. The seared tuna was \"seared\" black. Hardly seared if you burn it. It tasted like bad stinky feet. My husband had the shepards pie and you really can't go wrong there. We also ordered the brownie sundae and it was beyond sweet for me. All and all, not the best place I've eaten in but certainly not the worst. I would come back but will never come back again on date night with my husband.",

We get to the place and the first girl to help us was nice , but went on to tell us she suggests we call next time because our reservations wasn't in the computer and they were having problems with Yelp. We continue to be seated which we thought was so nice considering the mishap. Well the blonde up front walks outside when I went to park my car and put a huge sign saying RESERVATIONS ONLY!  Well then she comes back out and immediately takes it down, which I took personally considering what just happened. We waited an hour and a half with absolutely NO REFILLS! We were supposed to take a boat ride , but as our dinner took an hour and ten minutes to get to our table of 2, the boat rides were no longer available!  Our food finally came at 7:30 and we were immediately swarmed with flying bugs!  We did not get to enjoy our dinner! We got up , paid, and left.

We had dinner there (party of 7) at 6:30 on a Tuesday night and the place was virtually empty.  Although not busy they had already sold out of 2 of the wines on their list and the service was slow - no club soda upon request ( I asked twice) and one member of our party got the wrong entree, which took a long time to amend. I must say, I really enjoyed the food - the fried cheese curds, the spinach artichoke dip and calamari ( small portion for the price) were all delicious and interesting twists on the traditional. I got the Reuben - very good and my husband got the ABQ Turkey Melt, which he told me was \"meh\" - others got fish tacos, tri tip dip, cajun pasta and were all quite pleased. I want this place to do well - it is such a fabulous location and setting, but I fear its days are numbered if business does not pick up.",

Everything seemed to be fairly clean and our waitress was friendly enough. There were a couple things I found off putting though. I went for breakfast on a Sunday with several people right as they were opening.   1.) When we were seated we were given dinner menus and then no one came back to the table for 15min. Once someone did finally come back around we asked for the appropriate menu only to be given the dinner menu again! We were eventually able to get the right menus though.  2.) There are no condiments on the tables. Not a big deal in itself but when you only see your server once every 30min you realize how nice it is to have salt, sugar for your coffee, etc. Also note we were one of 2 tables in the entire restaurant.  3.) I actually made note more of when we placed our order and it took 1 hour for the food to come out. Most of the order was just eggs...  4.) Multiple orders were wrong! Some of the group I went with asked for things like no cheese or no onions but none of that happened.  5.) PRICEY! My order consisted of 2 eggs, 1 tortilla, a handful of diced potatoes and 2 strips of thin bacon. $11 easy.  6.) The server never returned...   Those were the main problems and as far as the food... just okay. Watershed has a lot of potential that they are doing nothing with. I don't see myself returning here again.",

The mimosa bottle special is a great deal ($15 for a bottle of champagne and choice of juices) and the food was good! Only complaint would be it was really, really hot in the restaurant- had to have been over 80 degrees. Granted there are a lot of windows and a crazy heat wave was happening when we went- but the air conditioning only kicked on maybe two times during the hour or so we were there. We could hear other tables complaining as well.  Definitely a place we would've loved to hang out at for longer, maybe in the cooler months when we can sit on the patio or when the air conditioner works better.",

The meat was cooked perfectly and topped with a homemade horseradish sauce and some crispy thin onion rings. Then there was this bun that was so light, flaky and buttery that I can't even do justice trying to describe. My fiance had the meat loaf with the green chile sauce. He loved it!

Everyone is friendly, but don't be in a rush when you come to The Watershed because the environment is catered for the easy life. Also, this is a Green Bay Packers bar, so if you are Packers fan, this is the spot to be on game day September through January.  Don't skimp out on dessert.

It is locate right on the lake and has a really nice patio with picnic tables on the grass and regular tables on the dock. Inside is spacious and open and has great views as well. Service was fantastic, our waters stayed filled, our drinks from the bar were quick and our food was well timed.   The imporant part, the food: YUM! We started with coconut shrip with mango habanero sauce. really good! Then the skilled queso con chorizo, another hit! Finally we shared the fish tacos. Again really good. Nothing dissapointed. For drinks, they have $10 speciatly cocktails. I started with a edelberry flower, spinach, lemon drop martini. It was soooooo good and refreshing. Great flavor combinations. They have a large selection of craft beers on tap as well, I noticed some Oskar Blue and I had an Oak Creek nut brown ale.    This really is a perfect spot for occasions as well as just wanting to enjoy a peacful, good meal with a beautiful view. So glad I found this place! It does sound like from some of the other reviews that they had a rough opening but they seem to have worked it all out. Service was fantastic, place looks beautiful and all the food was really good. The atmosphere makes food that is a solid 4 stars 5 stars easy.",

If I didn't have a Groupon for the Saturday/Sunday brunch I wouldn't have come based off of recent reviews. Unfortunately I bought this Groupon when they still offered the brunch menu only to come in and see they have recently changed to a \"buffet\". This might be a new thing they are trying and perhaps they need more data to determine it's worth so this needs to count as a solid negative for brunch buffet. We came in at 12:30, most of the food was gone and what was available was either burned or not a brunch food (salmon, chicken alfredo, lasagna)  we saw tables near ours with menu items so we asked and were told they had an appetizer coupon and menu items are not a part of the buffet which is all that is offered right now  We did give our feedback to the server in a respectful manner but who knows if it will make a difference because we were told the array of crappy options is to please people on a larger scale...I have yet to read a review on how amazing any of the brunch options are so that should say a lot in itself.  Our suggestion is to have a smaller menu of options and include one drink.  Note: this is not your normal buffet where you peruse the options and serve yourself, it is more you like you're at a hotel buffet or work conference meal. Food was horrible, options were horrible and we will not be back which sucks cause there is potential but I'm not willing to waste more money.",

    "text": "Summary: Great location, deplorably managed.  It would have seemed an incredible location for a sunny afternoon brunch for a family after seeing Santa Claus in the middle of the lake, an annual event here. After the experience we had, we will not be back and would *never* recommend it to anyone.   The problems boil down to profoundly inept management. Busy holiday event for kids next door? Don't bother to print kids menus or stock enough kids drink cups. Host seats a family? Be sure not to notify a server, so the family can wait for 25 minutes to get water and drinks and quick appetizers. Food arrives, no one has silverware or napkins? Make sure at least three waitstaff ignore the request before someone brings utensils. Server forgets to bring water or place appetizer order? Manager should be sure to offer an insincere apology and shrug it off and be sure not to try to make it right.  The problems were consistent across the board: a family docked their boat and claimed a spot (bussing their own table in the process), then eventually flagged down a host/busser and, some time later, a server. Another couple who had been seated had the same issue. By the time we had left, literally no one else on the deck had received appetizers or food of any sort.  The food was adequate, eventually, but the main attraction is location. It is a shame when you waste money and time visiting a restaurant, especially one that could be great if anyone running the place had any f*@#$ing clue what they were doing.",

To be fair, they have improved leaps and bounds since they first open. And I should say I really want this place to succeed.

Made reservations on Tuesday  May 2, 2017  for a party of 8 on Saturday May 6, at noon.  Arrived 10 min early,  was greeted nicely by the staff.  While awaiting the rest of the party to arrive was greeted by the server  Cruz he offered drinks.   It took approximately  15  min  before he brought the drinks.  The rest of the party arrived,  they ordered water all around   taking another 20 min to obtain. we ordered our meal that took 1 hour + to arrive.  Cruz came to the table 3x  to see if anything was needed  with out ever explaining why things were taking so long.  When questioned he said there was another large party that had also come in approximately the same time.   There were few other patrons in the restaurant.   After over 1 hour  the meal finally arrived  with several things missing.     needless to say this was a very bad experience.    Any restaurant should be able to handle  several large parties especially when they were informed ahead of time.   I will not be dining there again.",

Eggs that were just overcooked, cheese that was just a little too melted. Even better when the over-easy eggs that were solid got sent back, the place ran out of eggs.   One more time, just in case, the place ran out of eggs! During Sunday brunch. When they said earlier they they were sending someone to buy OJ for the mimosa we ordered we laughed and said, \"OK!\"   They ran out of orange juice and eggs during Sunday brunch. We saw the employee running up after fetching the eggs, very legit...he bought a dozen (they still had two hours or so of brunch left).   The guy who was apparently the manager, came over during the egg debacle and said they'd comp drinks and  the messed up egg meal and offered us a free breakfast coupon for later use. Apparently, they had a big wedding the night before and that messed up Sunday brunch.   After we got our checks, he did comp the messed up meal and some drinks. He also gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. No return coupon for breakfast. No big deal, we won't be returning for breakfast or at all.  He then shot my wife a dirty look as we left...cause y'know we were unreasonable customers wanting food to eat and competent management.",

    "text": "Sitting by the lake outside was beautiful and relaxing, and the hostess and wait staff were very friendly. These two things were probably the only positives about this place. The food was nothing to write about, and the cocktails were water-downed and sugary. We ordered the seafood cocktail as an appetizer and you could tell by looking at it that it was sitting there all day - tasting it confirmed it as it was flavorless and dull in color. The gumbo was lukewarm, and tasted like it came out of a can. We were kind of shocked to see that shrimp was an extra $5 to add - doesn't gumbo usually come with shrimp? The tri-tip sandwich fell apart and was not worth $15. Both entree dishes were forgettable and way overpriced. The tables and chairs are cheap folding plastic material. The price is outrageous for the quality of food and decor. We don't mind paying $20 for gumbo and $15 for a sandwich, but don't make it look and taste like it's been refrigerated and reheated for days on end.   I recommend skipping this place and going elsewhere. Sitting by the water is nice, but not worth it for the overly expensive food that is nuked in a microwave.   This place has a lot of potential, but the owners really need to put in some TLC and revamp the menu. Sadly, we won't be coming back.",

I've driven by a few times and saw lots of cars parked outside, but thought it was a private club. When a friend asked me to meet her there for happy hour, I jumped at the chance.   It's a gorgeous setting on the lake. We sat on the patio and watched the sun set while enjoying a glass of wine. (all wine & craft beer 50% ALL day on Monday!) You'll see a few neighborhood boaters wave as they float by on their little electric boats. If you want to join them, there's a boat ride that's only $5, that you pay for inside.   We both had salads that were delicious and fresh. They don't skimp on any of the goodies either (candied pecans..yum!). The service was prompt and courteous. There was a mix of older & younger generations. All seemed welcome and treated equally. Very nice place, and I definitely plan to go many more times, since it's less than 5 min from home!",

    "text": "I rarely write a negative review and try to find the positive in everything, but I can't hold myself back from sharing my experience of my 30th birthday here.   Let me start by saying I've had 2 large events here prior (a surprise engagement brunch and a 30th birthday for my friend) so it was one of the first thoughts for my 30th birthday on the patio. My husband emailed them more than a month prior to the night of our dinner inquiring about a reservation for 30 on the patio. My husband received a confirmation from yelp for a reservation without speaking to anyone which was odd. So he called and finally got ahold of a manager. She told us no problem to a reservation on the patio with the option of going inside for those who were cold since there's no heater. We told them some people might eat, some might just get drinks. All sounded great.   The day of the party in the morning, my husband gets a call from the host saying we see you have a large reservation for tonight and I'm just letting you know our policy has changed and you can't do separate checks. To which we replied - you thought the morning of was a good idea to tell us this? Not going to work for us - you're going to have to honor what you offered a month prior since you didn't give us time to know. We had to talk to the manager and get it straightened out and they finally said they would honor it.   Thank god we showed up an hour and a half early to eat our own dinner. We got there and the host seemed confused. She said sorry, we don't have room for you on the patio. There's other groups and it doesn't say you wanted the patio. We have too many reservations tonight. We can try and put you in the captains room. The room is nice enough, don't get me wrong, but not what we asked for and not what we wanted. We asked to speak to the manager. No one could find him and it took about 20 minutes to talk to someone. He tried his best to be polite, but continued to tell us there was a communication error. He didn't ever say sorry, just that there was an error. Then said he would look at the other reservations and call them and see if they would change their reservations. ????? He came back and showed me a patio area that could seat 20 and a couch with a fire pit. I said thank you, this is perfect and we'd like this area. He took the opportunity to tell me that they were \"helping us out and doing us a favor by doing separate checks tonight since the policy changed.\" Honestly - what poor timing. It was like let me remind you that you can't have a need from us since we're allowing separate checks. It just rubbed me the wrong way.   We asked if we could have the fire pit lit. They didn't have propane. They did bring us blankets.   Fast forward 20 minutes into the night and waiting for guests still. The host ended up sitting a group at the couch we had just reserved. I said to our server and host hold on - we just worked this out. The manager came back. And no joke, he said to me, \"Really? There's no one sitting there. You have all this space do you really need the space?\"  I finally told him this was clearly too much for him to handle and we would make our own evening work and not leave the area. It was too frustrating and was just ruining the night.   When the night started to die down, maybe about 1000, we moved into the bar area since we were cold. There were 10 of us left. They turned on the lights, shut off the music, and the bartender came to us to see if she could take any of our empty drinks. It was pretty clear we were being pushed out or the restaurant was closing 2 hours early on a Saturday.   Food is good - try the chorizo burger it is great. The view is pretty on the patio. The brunch with mimosas has always been a success for us. Our server was amazing for my birthday in spite of everything and we made sure to give her extra cash tip because she was a trooper and was really pleasant.   Don't do a big party and trust them with your event - you're better off keeping it small and just show up.",

    "text": "It has now been 3 weeks since I have been to this place. It took one week for a manager to even contact me after all of the hostesses did not give him the information to contact me. The manager assured me a great second chance which I have not received. I have tried contacting the manager 3 times since and have never heard back from him. All of the staff I have spoke to has told me they will tell him to contact me, yet 3 weeks have gone by with no contact. It's sad to see a business not treat their customers the way they should be treated. It's sad to see a manager not take pride in a restaurant and reach out to the customers who are trying to point out the flaws so that they can become better. Instead of taking it as a learning experience they choose to ignore it and pretend they are doing a good job. Disappointed to say the least.   Initial review: This unfortunately was the worst experience I've had in a long time. I took my bf here on a surprise anniversary date and I left EMBARRASSED AND DISAPPOINTED beyond what I imagined. When I have come before it was great but now I won't ever recommend it to anyone. When I called to make my reservation I asked to have the couches outside and she said yes. When I got there they put us on the opposite side of the restaurant to where we can't even see the lake. When I asked if we could move she said we were full. Our waitress took over 10 minutes just to bring us water after that. Then we finally ordered and it seemed like forever until we got our food. My order asked for no tomatoes which I didn't think was that hard to ask for, but guess what they put, tomatoes and I'm allergic. So picking around it was a haste and my bf burger was so spicy he had to pick off everything on it just to finish it. She didn't come over to ask if we needed anything during and he was without water with his spicy burger. While I was eating my meal my chicken was ice cold while my chips were hot and it was literally disgusting. While Emily checked on every other table around us, she only came to us twice during or meal while she went to everyone else about 5 times. When we left I wrote a note to send to the manager and expected a call. I was absolutely embarrassed to haven picked a place that I thought would be a nice surprise. If there could be less than one star I would choose it and if you decide to come here just prepare for bad service all around. Honestly choose somepl",

The waiter let the boat captain know that we were interested in a ride that came with our Groupon. The captain came over and introduced himself to us and checked to see how our meal was and when we might be ready to go for the 15 minute ride. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable from start to finish greeting to check payment. We will return and probably bring others to enjoy the Captain's Quarters and game area.",

When so many aspects of our experience are average you have to look at the management. They need to:   1.) hire staff that care and are motivated by providing an excellent experience 2.) have the chef ask the staff for feedback on the taste of the dishes 3.) get a manger that develops a sense of fun and a passion to be amazing",

Handful of lettuce, handful of tomatoes on one side, handful of mozzarella balls on the other.  The lobster ravioli seemed warmed up.  Panini was good.   By far the highlight was dessert. Yum. I realized after the fact that gratuity had already been added to the check (party of 5) so I tipped twice.  Shame on me I guess.  Boat ride is \"done for the summer \".

    "text": "I write this review in hopes that management will read it and implement a couple of my suggestions. The Watershed features a fabulous location with a water view, plus the interior is really nice. It has fantastic potential to be THE place to go to in Tempe.  But when I visited Thursday, December 13, 2018, it was strange. I got the sense they were understaffed, maybe a hostess and/or server or two had called in sick?  We first told the hostess we wanted to sit at the bar so we could seat ourselves. After sitting towards the end of the bar for about 10 minutes and being completely ignored the entire time by the two bartenders, we gave up and went back to the hostess station to be asked to be seated at a table. (A lot of drunk people in the bar, we were stone-cold sober and maybe that was the problem.)   We waited at the hostess station for about 15 minutes looking for the hostess, only seeing servers walking back and forth. The hostess was obviously helping out the servers. We almost left, but then I went and asked a server for help. Awkward.   My biggest complaint: The place was freezing, even with a coat on. The front door was intentionally left open, letting the cold in. I get that servers running around get hot. But the customers get cold. It sends a message to guests that management and servers think their comfort comes before the comfort of the guests. The place was freezing during each of my three visits. Such easy fixes. I hope management does something about this. And I sure would like to know why the place seemed to be in such disarray. It created a very bad impression having to wait so long to even spot a hostess or catch the attention of the bartender. My impression is the place was understaffed.  Our server was great and gave us good customer service.  The hostess was very nice and apologetic, but that doesn't make up for the experience of being made to feel you're not important.  If management replies to this and offers a reasonable explanation and that my experience isn't typical, I will be happy to adjust my review. I want  The Watershed to do well since it's seven minutes from my home.  This was my first evening visit - arrived at 6:35PM.",

Came to The Watershed last Saturday for an early dinner & was very much surprised at what a gorgeous venue we came to & wasn't aware of. We were thinking what a great place for a wedding reception. Tried something different, than going to our usual places we frequent a few times a week. Was looking for another home away home as you might say. Alicia our waitress was very nice & courteous. She recommended the Cajun andouille sausage pasta which we ordered, majority of the menu was over $12-$15 or more for appetizers to dinner entrees, so we expected the food to be higher end, we are sad to say it was not..we ordered chips & salsa which was blended & watered down & lacked flavor which was served with what tasted like store bought chips. The pasta came out & presentation was non existent, we received thick flat pasta in sauce & a slice a toast cut in half laying in the sauce. As we dug into the pasta there was maybe 3 or 4 bits not slices of andouille sausage & that was it for the whole dish which was $17...I'm sorry, it lacked flavor & did not taste Cajun. Our waitress kindly offered to take it off our bill & get us something else, but we had no confidence that anything else would have flavor, taste good or be out of this world enough to make us want to come back for something other than view. Willing to try again if the food gets elevated to something worth paying high $$$ for. Our server said that there was a new menu coming out & hoped we would come back. This place could be so profitable if the food was worth the cost.",

Drinks are watered down and despite how the website reads, it doesn't appear a mixologist was involved in making their menu.   Staff is courteous and normally this would make my ratings increase but the food was not good. Bruschetta, which seems simple enough, was barely toasted, though edible, just ok. Wings were flabby - neither grilled nor fried. Not good. Overall just not the level of food and drink I want to pay for when going out. Their prices are average so it's not like you're \"getting what you pay for\" by receiving this level of food and drink. I love the location, but sadly I probably won't return.",

I didn't expect much from The Watershed, as this has been several other unsuccessful restaurants relying simply on the lake views to bring in customers.  Watershed is different; and, although I only had the wedding meal, it was prepared by The Watershed kitchen and was very good.  The bar is great too, it is very large and has some great bar tenders to serve you.  Of course, there is always the large patio in the back that sits above the lake and is very nice to relax and have a meal, or just a drink.

We also ordered a side salads instead of a side.   First thing that went wrong was We got our entrees before our salad and appetizer. I mean that defeats the purpose of an entree. Then the kitchen forgot about my salad so another 5min go by and still no salad. Additionally the calamari was too oily and didn't seem fresh. The Thai curry bowl and enchiladas were pretty decent. But me and my wife for the next two days both got food poisoning.   Honestly besides the view, this restaurant doesn't have much to offer. The bathrooms were really outdated. service wasn't great and food got us sick. Maybe we had a bad experience.",

We had reservations at 10:45am and were seated immediately outside only to have to wait 30 minutes to even order any food. Normally for an Easter Brunch this would be normal if they were jam packed and busy but this wasn't the case. They were probably at 20% capacity when we got there and not too much more when we left 2 hours later. We had to go get the manager to finally order our food and even that took an additional 30 minutes to be delivered to our table. I ordered the tamales and received a burrito. I wound up just eating it since I didn't want to wait another hour to get it corrected. Half of the sides weren't delivered and we had to ask for them again. The manager tried to make it right with a 10% discount but even she was about as bland as the service. It's clear that the problem with this place starts with the manager. As we were leaving she was sitting at the bar as her wait staff was dealing with 2 other tables complaining about their orders and bills being completely messed up. The atmosphere here is great as well as the food but I will not be back and most of my table conveyed the same to me as we were leaving. Get it together manager.  Your wait staff is horrible!!",

    "text": "This place is really close to where I live. Driving or walking by, I expected it to be really dated... however, it was not. It was nice and tastefully (mildly) upscale with modern appointments and decoration.   The inside was beautiful, and the outside patio had a great view (though not enough light to eat by if you're there after dark). The service was a mixed bag... I mean, everyone was super nice and seemingly attentive, however, I had to ask three different people five different times for a set of flatware and a new napkin, and they only brought it after my food had arrived.  The reason I needed a new napkin was because when we walked up to the both, someone was cleaning it with just a dirty wet rag (Denny's style) and no cleaning solution. That is not clean, restaurants. If you're listening, wiping down a booth - the seat and then the eating surface - with the same filthy wet rag you carry around with you to dry your dirty hands and clean everything you walk by - is really, really disgusting.  Since the seat and table were still wet when we were sitting down, I just took my cloth napkin silverware burrito and used that to dry off the area... when I was done, I looked at the napkin, and it looked like I had just cleaned a dirty toilet with it. Dirty and gross. So that's why I needed a new napkin...   As for the food, it was sorta meh. The cod bites were terrible - somewhere between overcooked and burned. They also didn't have much flavor. I suspect they needed to change their oil. Didn't much care for my fries either. My date had a salad - she said it was good. We both ordered special cocktails. They were okay. We didn't stick around for a second drink though.  It might have been an off night, but I suspect the wet rag wipe-down is standard practice (that they picked up in the 90s). Also, it wasn't packed, but I suppose it was busy enough that I should forgive them for not bringing a napkin quicker. I'm definitely going to go back and try again because it's so close, but my first impression wasn't up to expectations or hopes - not up to par with these prices either. Also, I used to live near British Open Pub, and their cod bites are the best, so I was hoping this could be a decent substitute now that I've moved to Tempe. *sigh*",

We went there for dinner about a month ago, a family of five with three kids, along with another family. A Saturday night and we were almost the only ones there. Despite the lack of a crowd, the service was slow and the food was a total disappointment. My friend ordered steak, well done...it came out rare. My husband's fish tacos were unrecognizable. Even the kids complained that the food wasn't all that great. The server would disappear for 15 minutes and then be stopping by every 2 minutes. The wine selection needs a major upgrade. The selection of draft and craft beer is one of the shining stars.   The previous experience was for Sunday brunch. We had a reservation but were told that even though they could seat us, the kitchen was backed up and it would be at least 45 minutes until we could get our food. Barely any service in the meantime.   This restaurant could be a winner but mediocre food and inconsistent service are a recipe for disaster.",

The view and atmosphere are great, but the food is embarrassingly bad. Both visits have brought meals that look like they came out of a freezer 10 minutes ago, and this most recent lunch was just ridiculous. I ordered the turkey pita, and immediately recognized the pita, sliced turkey and fries as the exact same as the packages I have at home from Costco- the only difference is that I don't have the audacity to charge $11 when I make the same sandwich at home. In all, a $70 lunch with tip should bring a better result than everyone looking at each other and saying \"nice view, but let's check out the bar next door the next time\".",

    "text": "The Watershed has an absolutely beautiful patio and will transport you out of Tempe, Arizona. I suggest sitting out on the patio which is on a lake and is beautifully lit.   Inside, you can watch a game (it is a Packers bar which, IMO, is its biggest downfall) and play pool, you can have the best of both worlds of impressing your date with a scenic dinner AND you can sneak some peeks at the game....you're welcome.   I enjoyed some nachos, which were tasty, but I am unable to comment much on the rest of the menu as I drank my calories during my visit.   New Old Fashion - this was delicious. I'm not sure what was \"new\" about it as it tasted like a perfectly crafted Old Fashion, so good I had to order two...  Grape Fruit Margarita - Also yummy, but it was a little too grapefruity for my taste. I would skip this if you are looking for a pretty classic margarita.   Happy hour includes $5 drinks and food, so sneak in before 6:00 to get an amazing deal.  At the end of your evening, you can enjoy a $5 boat ride which lasts about 15 minutes around the lake. It is a very smooth ride, so don't be worried about drinking THEN getting motion sickness. The captain was great, very personable and was super easy going while we waited for our meals.  The servers were very friendly, but definitely a bit more relaxed. We waited a while for our server to return to order food and additional drinks. I wouldn't suggest coming too hungry as you may have to wait a while before you actually eat.",

Since we were warned, the environment outweighed and we decided it would be fun for the families. Be warned - the service is REALLY bad.   When we arrived we asked if we could sit by the grass for the kids. Typically there are tables there and there were none. They were not willing to accommodate. Once seated it took 10 min to meet our waitress. When she came by we immediately ordered kids food and then asked about the type of fish in the fish tacos. When she came back over another 10 minutes later the answer was mahi. Great- so after placing the orders, she says 'oh I forgot we are only doing brunch menus today'. Stunned, we looked at what was on the bunch menu at Saturday at 1pm and it was all breakfast foods. We asked if Fish Tacos were on brunch menu - no. Again stunned as why would you confirm the fish with the kitchen and tell us the fish? It was truly the lack of any remorse for the fact that we'd been there over 30 minutes and the breakfast menu should be no big deal that made us ask for a manager. The manager that came out was the initial hostess who I really don't think was the manager - otherwise I full question the owners care and value in this restaurant whatsoever.  She also offered no apology or remorse so we asked for the check for the kids meal and left. So sad as it really could be so great.",

We arrived 90 minutes before the movie & after being seated NO ONE AT ALL came to our table for the first 30 minutes. We kept trying to make eye contact. Finally one of us went to find someone. We told the hostess we weren't even offered water, so she went a waiter. He said he was sorry and someone would be over for our order and to get waters. I told him very firmly that we had a movie in 1 hour and wanted to order immediately. He said he'd take our order then. No apology. Nothing. Just took our order and then disappeared. A half an hour later (we just ordered a couple burgers and salads), he came back saying our food would be out soon. Five minutes later they came out! We scarfed our food while trying to flag him down for the checks. We paid quickly, sped across the street, and jogged into the film. The burger was good, but my god why does the service suck so much?",

Twenty minutes later when we finally got someone to notice us and seat us, we looked over the menu and ordered. The food is pretty dreadful and uninspired.

We put our order in right away along with the soft pretzel as an appetizer, and it took 30 minutes for the pretzel to come out, which definitely had us a bit irritated. But our waiter was nice and apologized and comp'ed the pretzel, and our entrees came out shortly after.   I got the ahi tuna salad, which was a tad overpriced for the mix you're getting, but the dressing was AMAZING. My boyfriend got a the tri tip sandwich and liked it a lot, and the fries were pretty great.   Overall, we want to come back because we live in the neighborhood. I think they might be a bit understaffed, and it was a relatively busy night.",

Overpriced food for the amount you get, horrible service (had to wait over 30+ minutes for the server to take our order), and the management at this facility was no help. We complained over 3 times to the manager who we got no apology from. After waiting 30 minutes to have our order taken, it then took another 30 minutes for the food to come out, and over half the orders were wrong. At this point, we were starving and were forced to eat something we didn't order. The food was average but nothing to brag about. Upon leaving,w e noticed the manager sitting at the bar. We wont be back. This place is a great location, and has a great curb appeal, but it lacks good management and staff which kills it's business.",

Ordered the Ahi burger and fish tacos which were both burnt and cold at the same time somehow.  The food blew donkey chunks. We thought we were just picky lil beaches but the guy next to us was howlin like a dang coyote at how much his plate sucked.

Where else can you feel like you got transported to some serene hideaway with sunset views that can only be matched by the friendly faces that dine here? This is such a great local spot that gives you the neighborhood vibe of a warm welcome the minute you walk in. If you just want a low key spot to catch the games, there's plenty of screens and bar seating to keep you entertained. Otherwise, the local music talent serenades you while you gab over with friends. My fave pairing is definitely the sliders with jalapenos accompanied by the house salad with grilled shrimp. To balance out the spice kick, drink up on the Kronenburg Blanc. You really can't go wrong except if you happen to miss the sky kissing you good night as the sun sets.",

The hostess when I came in was warm and welcoming and went out of her way to get us seated. The servers were all efficient and truly a team. The food was very good and there was a wide variety on the menu from full meals to wraps and burgers. There was also live music which was great but still allowed for conversation. When we left it was like saying bye to friends, even the general manager was out on the floor chatting with guests and staff. You could tell by the way he interacted with his staff the shared goal of the entire team is to make the dining experience great for their guests. Enjoy!!!!",

Hannah was super helpful with the planning, and let us annoy her with grace, lol.  Even the one tiny hiccup in the plans was quickly resolved and the manager was very understanding and quick to move it along.   The food. .... beautiful, delicious and perfect for a shower. The setting was gorgeous as the sun went down, and people even took boat rides (offered by the venue) I would recommend it to anyone looking to do an intimate party setting that allows you to add your personal touches.  One small thing: parking spaces can get scarce since it's a fairly modest lot in front of the restaurant, but if you don't mind a walk, there is overflow parking.",

    "text": "This had to be the worst experience ever for a restaurant I have gone to. First of all I went with a group of nine people for brunch. The waiter Alexander was extremely slow and didn't seem like he knew what he was doing. He took our orders and kept forgetting to bring things to us when our order came. Three of us refused their food because it was cold or the wrong order. Mine tasted good but it was cold even though it was on a second plate that was hot. Most likely to keep it warm. My  coffee was cold and I never was served water. One lady who was a vegetarian got meat on her omelette. Another lady had just sent her order back because it was the wrong order. Another lady said her food was so cold that she refused to eat it. The bill for certain ones came up incorrect. And when I gave him my credit card to pay for my bill and he came back with it he didn't know whose credit card was whose and there was only one. When I went to the restroom it was so disgusting and had never been cleaned from the night before. There was pubic hair and toilet paper remains that were sitting all over the back of the toilet. The waiter constanly made excuses about him serving 6 tables but the place was basically empty. I would not ever recommend anybody eating at this establishment simple because of the poor service, the filthy toilets and have a scatterbrain way of cooking the food. Came back again just to see what everyone was saying about the best time to go was happy hour. Went on a Wednesday and sat at the bar. I ordered drinks which were pretty good and strong. Also ordered a appetizer which ended up getting mixed up and was sent to another table. A hour later I finally got my appetizer. He comped me 10% for the wait. This place just can't get their act together.",

    "text": "The Watershed could be an instant classic. The space and the setting are really stellar. But the food and service are laughably bad. And that's not an expression... every one of my trips there ends in a funny story about the multiple things that are weird and/or go wrong. The waitstaff is all oddly awkward. I've never been unsold an Arnold Palmer until I came here. The same dish, ordered twice during the same visit by different people I am with, will come out noticeably different.  I never imagined a question like \"can you turn your heat lamps on the patio on?\" would leave multiple employees utterly baffled. They used to charge $8 for a plate of French fries (?!?!) Once I asked my server for salt and pepper as he brought my entree. On his third trip back to my table without it, he snapped at me when I asked for it AGAIN. Just fucking bring it. Most recently, it took 3 requests for a kids menu to learn that they have one, but it isn't printed. So he had to read it off his iPhone thingy. It worked out but was just really weird. Same trip,  the process of paying took 30 min, including 15 min between when he dropped it and came back for my payment. Oh, the bartenders... holy crap. Apparently the main requirement to work there is the ability to find as many reasons as you can to stand with your back to customers for as l long as possible. I've seen them mess around with the POS system for 9 or 10 minutes straight without making the most remote attempt to acknowledge people 6 feet away from them staring and waiting for service.  Yes, these stories are plentiful because I have been there a bunch of times. It's an awesome place to hang out. They have live music. I live in the neighborhood. But I could imagine myself going to the watershed ALL THE TIME if their food and service were even solidly  \"passable\". If they somehow read this and opt to be responsive, they could gain a very loyal customer with a sizeable group of friends who live within 2 miles of the place.  General first order needs: consistency, competency, attentiveness. Next:a well thought out menu, where a couple things are done REALLY well and there are no surprises. Specific tip: don't tell me that the very obviously $0.89/lb roma tomatoes on the bruschetta are heirloom. I happen to know the difference.",

I had the fish and it came in rolls like small burritos. I literally got less than a tablespoon of coleslaw with it. So I asked for more and I was given a small plate full of coleslaw. However, there was barely a drop of dressing on it. It was more like shredded cabbage that you get in a bag at the grocery store. My husband has had the baby back ribs at least two or three times. He said they were absolutely terrible and did not even finish them. So unlike him. The waiter was new but needed much more training. He never even asked what kind of dressing I would like on my salad. Just brought a balsamic. That was fine but it was hardly enough. When I asked to get my side salad before my dinner he brought out the entree salad with chicken that my friend ordered. I told her to just start eating without us. I doubt I will ever go back there. I will also tell my other friends, who used to go there , as well.",

The items we got (burgers) were overpriced for what they are.  The one saving grace of this place is that the wait staff is always friendly.

The food was awesome. We had the crab cakes, cod fish n chips, and chicken skewers to start which were all really great. For my dinner I had the shrimp penne pasta...omg amazing...one of the best things I have ever eaten. I don't say that lightly. I also sampled the the green chili enchiladas and those were delicious.

Unfortunately they were unable to accommodate people with the establishment close to full. There were only 3 or so wait staff for the large restaurant, and it would take 30 minutes to get our first beer.  The lake-tasting water served reminded us of what you got in the Valley 15 years ago--so glad most establishments use RO water now!  Good luck getting bottled water, we had to ask three times.    We arrived at 6:30 for a 6:45 reservation but were not served our meal until almost 9.  The meal was not as ordered--a flour tortilla for our celiac suffering friend when should have been corn.  Also, it seemed they forgot to add water when cooking the rice. Not to worry, they comped our meal and offered free drinks.  We declined the drinks to get home to relieve the sitter--and two of the four would go home hungry.  Our meat loaf was good once we gathered the courage to eat it (they had lost our trust in so many ways that we were nervous).   Perhaps if they hired more people they could charge full price and actually afford propane for their beautiful patio (it is currently $35 per hour for private parties only).  We were told to try them again--they were coming out with a new menu.  As our friend quipped--the menu is one of the few things they shouldn't change.  The delivery is what is lacking.",

We made a Mother's Day reservation for one of the 1st reservations of the day.  1st when we got there some of us had to use the restroom after the 45 + minute drive there.  The bathrooms were so nasty dirty like nobody cleaned them the night before. The mens room had no paper towels and the women's bathroom my wife said was so dirty with towels on the floor everywhere.   (Hopefully their kitchen isn't like this.) So we do get seated at our reservation time then takes about 15 mins for someone to introduce themselves as our waiter. Then after we order drinks it takes so long we have to go to the bar to get our own mimosas. After another 15 mins of sitting there waiting we final get to order our food.  Waiting and waiting for our waiter to even come by to order another round of drinks we are now 1 hour and 15 minutes in and we don't have food or more drinks.  So we hit the 1 hour and 30 minute mark and we decided to talk to someone and just leave still without any food. If they knew Mother's Day was a big day for them they should of been prepared!   Nice place but our 1st impression not so good.   Hopefully they get their act together.  Had to make plan B in their parking lot so my wife, mother in law, wife's grandma and aunt all had the Mother's Day they deserved!",

Twice the order for a person in my party was missed, causing them to sit without any dinner while others are eating.  On both occasions we waited for hours for dinners.  Three hours for a one course meal is incompetence.  The meals were dull and uneventful.  The salmon was cooked well, but flavorless, and needed a sauce.

Once we were given a drink menu, tried to order several different beers only to be told they didn't have them. Drinks were slow to come out. If you want a second drink, order it half way through your first so you get it by the time you finish the first one. Then they brought out two of our five meals. There was no silverware on the table, but there was no one around to ask for any. Had to go inside and request to have some brought out to us. By the time they brought us silverware, the two meals were cold and the three other meals had still not come out. When the other meals finally did come out, they were less than hot. Had to send the steak back. Meanwhile, still waiting on that second round of drinks! One would think that the service would get better once a complaint is lodged, but it only got worse. Waitress disappeared for 15 minutes at a time, no apology from her or a manager, no offer to comp or discount anything. Epic disappointment. The view from the patio is the only reason to go. Do not go, Do NOT go,  DO NOT GO to the Watershed.",

When we arrived we asked the hostess (who was wearing a dress you would see in a club...we literally almost saw her butt cheeks) if we could switch the table she brought us to to another table closer to the water. She said there's a reservation. No one sat at the table the entire time we were there and the place was completely empty for that matter. The food was absolutely awful and barely a decent portion. Our bill wound up being over 200$ for terrible food and not the best service. We didn't even get asked if we wanted dessert and when we asked for dessert, apparently there wasn't any. Then we asked for coffee and we were told \"Well I can go make you some.\" Unprofessional comment, but sure we went along with it and ordered. The server came back and all of a sudden said they didn't have any coffee. Right... We complained to our waiter about the evening and nothing was done about it. No mentioning to a manager or having a manager come over and speak with us. We were frustrated and just completely over it. I can see why automatic gratuity was added because the server probably wouldn't have received anywhere near the auto grat amount. The fact that it was 20% is outrageous and the server was definitely not deserving of that money. As we were leaving, the whole staff was joking around and lounging around the restaurant area. Beyond unprofessional attire and behavior. This day was poorly planned and executed. We will never come back here. Made this Mother's Day dinner feel like a huge waste.",

My husband and I got married here 8 years ago (it was called The Waterfront at the time and only a wedding venue) and we went there last night to celebrate our anniversary. I was SO excited all week getting to come back to such a special place to us. I had no idea they had made it into a restaurant! We had a TERRIBLE experience. I am not one to complain but it was awful. We decided to sit outside (because I was being nostalgic and wanted to eat in the area we got married) and were only one of two couples who braved the cold outside. Our waiter started off great. Nice, friendly and attentive. He had a girl shadowing him. He got our initial drinks for us, took our order after we ate our appetizer and everything was great up to this point. Well it took almost 45 minutes for our food to come out to us. Cold and stale to be exact. In the meantime, my husband never got his drink refilled, I had to drink his water because they never refilled mine. Ridiculous. It was a Tuesday night. Come on! Our waiter finally brought our food to us and apologized saying my medium well steak took a while to cook. 45 minutes?!?! What? At least come out and check on us and tell us why we are waiting. But nope, didn't get that courtesy. We ate. My husbands burger was fine, but the French fries tasted like they had been microwaved. My food was so-so... not worth $29. THEN once we were done, we sat there for a while talking. We were on a date, so it's not like we were trying to rush too fast, but it was getting really cold and we needed to get home to our kids. We waited and waited and I finally had to ask the other waiter from the other table for our check (which I didn't understand why he just wasn't our waiter when there were only two couples outside?) he said let me go get your waiter and let him know you are ready. I looked down at my watch to see what time it was. It took our waiter 16 minutes to come bring us our check. I just don't get it. He had a girl shadowing him. She should have come check on us if he was so busy inside. He finally came back out and gave us our check and apologized for the lack of service. Even he knew he was terrible. He tried giving us a free boat ride. Umm it was 8pm... dark and cold. Why would we go on a boat ride at this time? I'm just so disappointed. I wanted to love it and have it an annual place we return on our anniversary, but honestly don't think I would waste the money again. We really wanted to bring our 3 kids here to show them where we got married. Something needs to change or this beautiful place won't be around much longer and that breaks my heart. Unless things change, don't waste your money, or just go to have drinks and enjoy the beautiful deck.",

We had five in our party and our food came out in three rounds with about five minutes in between each.  The Mac and cheese (which was $5 for a small cup- yikes) for my son was cold as were my mashed potatoes, and my husband's dish had more sun dried tomatoes than anything else in it and was swimming in a thick glue like Alfredo sauce.  Our waitress seemed incredibly distracted even though the restaurant was almost empty. I think we were her only table but she didn't check on us much,  and kept \"forgetting\" things we asked for.

The server did not acknowledge any issues and disappeared frequently, this being the most unacceptable issue. We didn't want to complain for fear of waiting longer. They had a private party on the deck and I am not sure if that was the issue - but looking at other reviews - I am not sure that was the problem.  This place has such potential but the service and the food will be its demise if it doesn't change!  I guess if you're are not on the deck, you're getting less of an experience?

    "text": "How have I not reviewed The Watershed yet? Let me fix that tout suite!  BACKGROUND  I first heard about The Watershed in 2016 when some friends took me here for brunch, and I've been a fan ever since.  THE WATERSHED  The Watershed is situated on a 52 acre lake with over 4,000 square feet of lakeside patio and a spacious interior that boasts lake views from every seat.   Located in the Lakes community at Lakeshore Drive, south of Baseline Road (next to another patio bar and cafe, Pier 54), The Watershed is the patio-focused project of Valley residents Dan and Robin Scott, who opened their new cafe and bar of American eats on December 8, 2013.  The name, \"The Watershed,\" gets inspiration from the watersheds of the southwest. John Wesley Powell (the Lake Powell, Powell) defined a watershed as, 'That area of land, a bounded hydrologic system, within which all living things are inextricably linked by their common water course and where, as humans settled, simple logic demanded that they become part of a community.'  That's what they strive to be: a place where people come together to meet, to eat, to cheers, to sing, to dance, to rekindle, to relax and to revel in the moment.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I was surprised the first time I was introduced to The Watershed, because I had no idea Tempe had such a place.  The Watershed didn't look like much to me from the parking lot, but when we walked in, the view was outstanding.  Is it an International 5/5 Star view? No, but it's pretty damn spectacular, especially for Tempe.  I really liked the restaurant/bar too. It's all wood and it has a open floor plan, that makes the view visible from every seat.  The first time I came, I had the bloody mary and crab cakes. That's the day I became a fan. The experience was that great for me.  I've come countless times since then.   I've watched the sunset many times, whilst having their specialty drinks, and eating the sliders and coconut shrimp.    I've come for Sunday brunch many times. I love sitting on the patio, whilst drinking mimosas and eating pancakes.  It's also a fun place to just drop in for some fresh raspberry martinis and soft tacos, whilst watching live music.  I even enjoyed the lake boat ride one Sunday with Captain Doug.  The bartenders/servers have ALWAYS been FANTASTIC: Two of my favorites are Katie and Aaron, but everyone is 100%.  CONCLUSION  I openly admit having a bit of a crush on this establishment; mostly because I've only had positive experiences here.  The food is outstanding. The view is the best in Tempe. The service is always on point.  My only complaint is the mosquitos on the patio, so I bring bug spray.  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Closed on Mondays.  *Sunday Brunch with Boat Rides.  *Available for special occasions.  *Plenty of parking out front.",

I know any business can have an off day, so I took two co-workers and a niece visiting from Texas back for a second try on a bright Saturday morning. So glad I did. The food was fabulous and the service 150% better than the first time in speed, correctness, and server personality. We sat outside and this time did the too-brief boat trip which was fun --- we met some great nurses from (brrr) WI who were on a spur of the moment long girl's weekend.   We were on a Groupon --alert you get one drink each and after that they are pricey. We had a little of everything from the menu and the food was great.   Since then I have gone back for happy hour twice.      I recommend the Watershed, and hope the quality experienced on my subsequent visits is the norm.",

Yes, my wife and small children were told that we could not eat here and to be dismissed from the property. We weren't rude or causing a scene like you read about on other reviews but at the end of the day, my family's money was no good here on a typical lunch Sunday afternoon after church when the doors were open. What's even more disappointing is that they sent an advertisement to our house asking for business. There were several tables open not even a quarter full and we got to watch another family that came in after us get seated. Maybe they were short staffed but imagine for one moment if you took your family to an open restaurant for lunch and was told you couldn't be served. Not in the restaurant, not on the patio, and not at the bar that also only had on table of five but was to much to be served. There were at least twenty open tables. It was our first time coming here but I promise you that we won't be back. Never have I even been treated this way.",

    "text": "So I had been wanting to try this restaurant for years now. We finally made it on Sunday morning. I called before we went ,just to make sure they were open.  When we first got there the place looked so run down, as if it has never been remodeled. There was only about 10 people there inside and out combined. The place is very large though. If it was nice, you could have a Wedding reception there or some other type of party.  When we came in ,we were greeted by a nice girl at the receptionist desk. She showed us a bit of the place and asked if we would like to sit inside or outside. Since it was an amazingly cool day in the Valley, we wanted to sit outside. The whole point of this place is it is on the water.  Even though it is a man made water way, it is still nice to sit and dine. You are limited on what you have to choose from here in the Phoenix Area.  Anyway, She sat us and gave us menu's. She said our server would be right with us. She also explained that we would fill out this piece of paper as to what type of omelet we wanted. Whilst walking to our table,she told us that they only served a buffet until 3:00pm , then they began dinner. The menu was pages of Alcohol. So I really think that they are pushing more to be a bar than a dining establishment.  We got a nice table on the water, and filled out our omelet requests and then we waited. No one ever came. There were 2 other occupied tables outside and no one ever came to check on them either. They looked as if they had been there awhile. We saw the hostess again, she came running out to help one of the tables already dining, maybe to get their check or something. She was nice enough to stop at our table as well. To check on us. We gave her the omelet papers and told her we had still not seen a server. This poor girl seemed to be the only one paying attention to what was going on in the place.  We went up to get our food at the Buffet. What a mess!  I know the chef making the waffles was very proud of it all but, have you ever been to another Buffet, another restaurant, a party! Every thing was just thrown up on the tables. There was not even a resting dish for the serving spoons. So the spoons were inside the food containers. Scorching hot and full of germs from everyone's hands. The lids were half on some containers, not on others at all. Most of the food was really dried out. Either over heated, or over cooked. Everything was messy.  Some of the food items were quite good. Others I could not try! They just looked un edible.  When we got back to the table we had 2 waters with lemons and straws. That was nice. However, that was it. No coffee and no salt and pepper or any other condiments. You also must collect your own Silverware whilst you are at the Buffet. A knife and fork wrapped in a cloth napkin. No spoons.  Our server Alexi(i think) did come over to ask if we wanted cocktails at 11:30am. I said no think you , but we would like 2 coffees, luckily I also added we needed cream. She brought them with 2 big Ice tea spoons, so maybe they do not have teaspoons here. I had to go looking for sugar and salt and pepper , and hot sauce. I luckily found them on a table inside. Shortly after that a man brought out our Omelets and they were hot which was really nice. We had to get ourselves refills on coffee,from the Buffet. I do not know why they even have a server.  The best part is ,IT IS $20.00 A PERSON FOR THIS BUFFET.  I never mind paying for a good meal but, this whole thing is crazy.   I really wanted it to be good. I had been looking forward to going here for a long time. They could make a really nice place here. But, they have a lot to learn. The little blonde girl who was the hostess was literally running and helping other tables. I felt sorry for her she was doing so much, everyone else was just taking it easy. I even had to ask the hostess if we could get our bill as we never saw our server again. Till it was time to take the $$$.  We sat with dirty dishes in front of us for 17 min. while the bus boy walked back and forth past our table. I said, we are through please. You can take these dishes. He said great, and brought the dirty bus pan over to us{ with dirty dishes in it} So we could put the dishes in it. Atrocious! Sorry to say, we will not be back. We might try the little place next door. But, The Watershed is not worth your time or money.   Apparently this place has changed hands many times.This is a fairly new owner as well.",

    "text": "We came for breakfast right when they opened at 9 A.M. on a Sunday. We were seated promptly and our server came by to take our drink orders. That's the extent of our good experience here. From then on things went downhill. Our coffee cups came with cream but it took a long time for someone to get sugar packets to us. I looked at my coffee cup. The rim was filthy with what looked like dirt as I could rub a powdery brown substance off of it. I requested another coffee cup which came out with brown stains still on the cup.  I opted for the standard breakfast, with carne adovada. Unfortunately we were told that they ran out of carne adovada (AKA they did not prep any yesterday to cook for today). So, I opted for the chorizo instead. The breakfast came with 2 eggs, which I ordered poached. After a few minutes our server came by to say the kitchen has no way to make poached eggs right now. Really? I refuse to believe that they do not have a pot and water to boil in their kitchen.   The breakfast, when it finally arrived, was OK, nothing special. The chorizo overall had good flavor but parts of it were looking overcooked and black. I do appreciate that they added 2 extra pieces of bacon to the meal to make up for the lack of carne adovada and poached eggs.  At $9, you are really just paying for the great views because you can find a better quality breakfast with better prices at Denny's. Let the diner beware!",

DO NOT go there for the food, or you'll be disappointed.  I have to wonder if the owner/owners would rather just have a bar, and begrudgingly decided to offer food, because they figured they had to. The food is of the microwaved variety, and sub par at best. Yuck.  Take note, owners - please try to give a **** about your customers, & overhaul both your menu & kitchen staff.",

    "text": "My wife and I went in on Saturday to enjoy the weather and sit out and have a drink overlooking the water. Pretty hard to enjoy your time when you are being ignored by the entire waitstaff. After sitting for close to 10 minutes with no service, I walked up to one of the servers who was serving on the patio and asked if we could get drinks from her. She replied to me \"Did the hostess seat you?\" I told her no and that there was no one at the host stand when we walked in. We saw a high bar top open on the patio and grabbed it. The waitress then told me that if we wanted drinks or food, the bar could help us out. Pretty annoying, but we still decided to just go up to the bar and take our drinks outside. While drinking our beers, there were about 5/6 tables that had yet to be bussed and stayed like that for about 35/40 mins. There was another woman who came in and sat down at a table outside, and it was clear the waitress was avoiding her as well. About 10 minutes later the woman got the waitresses attention, she asked if she could order something. The waitress again asked her if she had been seated by the hostess and when the woman said no, the waitress replied \"well since you weren't sat, let me check and make sure this table isn't reserved.\" At this time, the entire patio was empty other than a few tables, and all the others had dirty glasses and dishes all over them. The woman then got up and told the waitress \"nevermind, I'll go somehwere else\" and she left the restaurant. We then overheard the waitress talking to one of the tables and explaining to them that it was time for her break so someone else was going to be taking over serving them. It is clear that the waitress was more interested in going on break than taking care of the customers.   I worked in the industry for years and would never treat guests that way. I understand that you have breaks and all that, but at least take the order and then transfer them to the next server. The other woman just got up and left and in retrospect, that's what we should have done as well. I have now been to The Watershed about 10 times and have never really had good service. I keep giving it another chance because it is such a great location and beautiful building, but I believe that after this experience I will never return.",

It's not as though the place is heaving with people.. in fact it's pretty slow and quite.

NOT coming back anytime soon.. Sad as it has the greatest potential!! Oh and I forgot to mention when they brought out the food to the table next to us and THEN told one of the people that they are out of wings (I guess that's what he ordered) and that they could make his second choice quickly..

I made a reservation for 10 people for Easter Sunday then when I called to change it to 7 people, I was told they were completely booked so I showed up understanding that service might be a little slow. First off it wasn't busy at all, and service was absolutely horrible!!  After waiting 30 minutes in the sun for service, one member of our party went to find our server. That didn't even work. Another member of our party then went to speak with the manager. I should mention that we're now hot, aggravated and almost out of water/drinks. We relocated to a table in the shade and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, so all was now good...or not. Two out of 7 orders were wrong. We decided to not wait for food to be reordered and just ate it. The food was actually the best part of this experience, other than our awesome bus boy! I wish I would have asked for his name. He needs to be promoted to server and the server released from her duties. The manager so graciously took 10% off our bill, which didn't even cover the cost of one of the incorrect entrees. But thanks anyway. We won't be back until this place is under new management and has better staff and service. I'm pretty sure every table on that patio had problems with their service and orders today. That's ABSOLUTELY unacceptable!!",

In my humble opinion, people that give this place good reviews are not doing it based on the food and service. Probably a good place for happy hour, playing games, and eating/munching once you're drunk.   The kitchen - food and service - needs revamping.  Once that is fixed, this place will be great.

I do love how you can sit outside over looking the lake it's so peaceful They also have a ping-pong table and a giant oversized Jenga!! Which hands down my fiance and I slaughtered everybody in both. They did a buffet which included House salad, coleslaw, chicken on skewers, pulled pork, ribs and Hawaiian bread rolls... Now I'm not sure if this is on the menu that they serve on a daily basis but everything overall was pretty tasty the coleslaw was probably my favorite thing out of everything other than Hawaiian bread rolls.. After dinner we got a boat ride around the lake. Which was included after dinner and wow it was so awesome so relaxing it was the perfect way to end this wedding reception we attended! I definitely would like to come back here and try food on their menu and go on the boat ride again...",

He kept coming back every few minutes to check on us and make sure that we had everyt if we needed. We were in no hurry and were just enjoying the gorgeous sunset and sipping on drinks. Once we ordered our food came out pretty quick - and was really good. I thought it was slightly pricy, but  overall not too bad. Ps if you get fries - the sweet potato ones I liked much better than the regular ones!   If you can make it in time to watch the sunset over the water it's absolutely awesome. Once it's dark the little lantern type lights they have come on - along with lights strung along the railing and above the patio (and give you blankets to use if you're cold). Inside they have a one man jazz band playing music, so you can't go wrong whether you sit inside or outside!   We'll definitely be back!",

You know because intoxicated employees behind the bar does the liquor board proud. Whats the point of having a beautiful location if the service makes you question who actually runs this place.

I was put in contact with Sharmayne, who is an excellent Events Manager at The Watershed. From any confusion and problem, she was right there to listen and do everything she could to make it work for us. Considering we had a tight budget, she really helped us out as much as possible to meet all the requests of the company. Did I mention.. She is AWESOME! Once it came to the night of the party, she even made an appearance to ensure everything was perfect and how we wanted it. We had an awesome turn out! So many compliments on the food and service.

Yes, it was a Friday, but hardly \"busy\" in comparison to any other restaurant.  Most people decided that the wait wasn't worth it and left.  The food when it arrived was below average.  I ordered the burger, which I figured would be quick and hard to mess up.  Unfortunately half the toppings I ordered were missing and I wasn't about to wait another hour for it to be corrected.  My date's pork sandwich was average, but I wouldn't order again if given the opportunity.  The fries were cold.  Other items on the menu sounded more appealing, but for the location and type of restaurant, way too expensive.   $15 for an entree is too high for the area and quality, and I doubt too many people would be willing to order those entrees after waiting 20 minutes before receiving a menu.  Also, $7 for a craft pint is twice the price of anywhere else in the area.    Overall, a 2 hour dining experience not by choice.  Unfortunately, I will not return.  This was the second time I have been to this restaurant and it is the second time I have left disappointed.  I would have been willing to try again if a manager was willing to make customary rounds and apologize to customers for the horrible service (every table around us was complaining about the hour long wait for food to get to the table).",

    "text": "I want to say that I enjoyed my visit, but I would be lying. I arrived here a few weeks ago with a large party for dinner. I had ordered water and the caesar salad ($8) with grilled chicken ($4) because I wanted a healthy option. Had I know that the portion would be the size of my palm, I would have never stepped foot in the restaurant. When my plate was put in front of me I knew I had gotten screwed over big time. I had read the reviews beforehand, and people really did mean it when they said you're paying for the view and that the food is tasteless, but I had no choice since another girl had made the reservations. My total was $16 after they added state tax, city tax, and a VERY generous gratuity which they did not deserve since it took about 30 minutes for our food to be served. In my honest opinion, don't bother coming here.",

    "text": "First of all.  We almost didnt come here because of all of the negative reviews.  Secondly, this place is Fantastic!!   We made a 5pm reservation, traffic kept us a little late, no problems.   Its January, but we decided to sit on the deck, we were provided nice warm blankets to which the wait staff even draped over us,  show  me a restuarant where the waitress will do that for you....Heather was awesome!! Our friends caught up with us 30 minutes after we seated.  We had a nice IPA, and specialty drink while waiting.  No rush no hurry, had an appetizer, and another drink before dinner,  Jumbalaya was awesome, fish and chips were awesome, the full rack of ribs that my friend ordered looked like brontosaurus ribs from the Flintstones.  Part way through the meal, Steve came out and did some up close magic tricks with us...  amazing!!!  It was my wifes birthday, they brought out a brownie sunday...( I know everyone does that....) heres the thing, usually you eat the icecream.....not this time.  Brownie was phenomenal.  Afterward the four of us took a cruise around the lake in the pontoon boat.  Beautiful.   This dinner cost the same or less than a meal at applebees.  You want my tip.  Make a reservation, bring some friends, make a night of it.  We spent three hours having an awesone dinner, enjoying company and conversation, interacting with the staff.  Wonderful evening.  We were so impressed that we had to tell them we were scared to come out but were glad that we did!!  Will go back again and again.",

    "text": "We went to the Watershed with a group of friends last weekend and would for sure recommend this great restaurant to others! First, we are always looking for unique restaurants in our area and the atmosphere here was great - we loved the patio overlooking the water, the twinkle lights and when we finished watching the sunset - it got a little colder and they quickly brought us over a heater. The waiter that we had was friendly and knowledgable. (Heads up they do use a phone to take yours order)  We started with The northshore - (grilled pineapple mojito) and The Pirates cove speciality drinks. Both my husband and I are pretty particular about our drinks and these were both unique and delicious! We also tried their tortilla coconut shrimp, queso fundido and chili fries. The sauce for the shrimp was spicy so it gave this simple dish a twist and although I don't typically order fries as an appetizer - the seasoning on these were very good.   They are still working on completing the inside and we can't wait to see it when finished. We did have 1 drink in the \"fireplace/game room\" and the decor was homey and quaint. There were several big football games playing on Saturday and the manager was accommodating and changed one of the games so we could watch our team.  All and all I am giving this a 5 star and we will be taking our parents there very soon.",

    "text": "Wow... First time there upon recommendations from friends. We made reservations for patio seating which worked out fine.  It had rained earlier that day and the couch seating was soaked in parts.  Still seated us there and warned us to avoid the wet areas.  Unfortunately the bottoms of all the cushions were wet so I ended up with wet jeans anyway.  No biggie.  It took a very long time, in excess of 10 minutes, for anyone to acknowledge we were there.  Drinks took forever.  Order apps to share at first, they were very good!  We ran out of drinks and longed for refills.  Next came the meals.  Ribs were tasty and my wife ordered the shrimp penne.  When her plate was delivered the shrimp were burned.  After waiting forever to show the waiter (who didn't come) we flagged down someone else to report our issue.  They said they would get her more shrimp.  10 more minutes and a small plate of shrimp arrived.  Burned!  We couldn't believe it!  By then the waiter stopped over.  We showed him the pile of burned shrimp we were collecting.  He said he would get her more shrimp and ran off.  We were completely finished eating and wanting to leave.  Then comes the third plate of shrimp.  Only partially burned.  Joy!  She ate the appetizing 2 and was finished.  No compensation for crappy food, no manager was notified...  Nothing.  Avoid this place.",

My husband and I booked a reservation ahead of time online for water-front seating, and when we got there they told us even despite our reservation they had no seating outside for us. This was the whole reason I wanted to come. So we sat at a table with a window instead. Then, next comes out less-than-friendly waiter who they informs out that they were out of drink menus to hand out. So I asked \"what kinds of white wine do you have?\" and the waiter had no idea. He just stood there. So then my husband says \"is it on the website?\" And then we had to search through their less-than-user friendly website on our phones to find a drink. He took about 15 Minutes to come see us again and when he did he said \"how are you guys doing?\"  Well, would have been doing fine had he taken our drink order. Then it took another 10-15 minutes to get our drinks (my white wine was warm BTW but chose not to send it back since I'd have to wait another 10 mins).  The food? It was just OK.",

The table we were placed at was not clean-has food crumbs on it. The waiter was a nice enough guy, but it took over 40 min to get our food and he only stopped by the table once to tell us it would be right out....20 minutes later we were still waiting.  There was no bread basket and no offers of anything. Then, out comes the food. My son ordered salmon for $28. It was LITERALLY the smallest piece of salmon I've ever seen; maybe 4 inches long. We all just stared at each other in shock. Yes, it tasted good, but ridiculously small. I ordered a Reuben sandwich, which was pretty good-nothing special at all. It came with a handful of stale chips. My husband ordered some ahi, which he said was okay-tiny portion and certainly not a dinner sized portion. We only saw our server four times, to take our order, to tell us (after 20 min of waiting) that the food would be right out, to bring the food and drop the check. Again, nice enough fellow, but horrible service. WAY over priced for what you get. Sadly, we will never come back.",

The views, service, and food were all excellent. We love New Mexican food and they had the absolute best green chili chicken enchiladas around that kept us coming back. We moved away from the area and hadn't been in several months, but when relatives from New Mexico visited, we made the drive for dinner expecting all of the same things.   We arrived to discover that several of the traditional New Mexican items that we had loved so much had been removed from the menu, including the enchiladas. Much of the menu had been redone, but we figured that we would find the replacements to be just as tasty. We were wrong. The food was mediocre and the service was very slow. There were a total of six of us and only two of us got what we had originally ordered. When I asked what the soup was, I was told it was a chicken bacon chowder, but instead received a meatball and macaroni soup, someone who ordered a side salad never received it, and three of the others had to reorder their meals multiple times because each time someone would return and say that they were suddenly out of it. The manager came over and offered to discount the meal. Our waitress also offered to not charge us for a sirloin that arrived after everyone else had finished their meal. She honored this promise, but we were all so disappointed by the service and the food that we will not be returning. We felt that much more could have been done and that the manager didn't follow through with his offer.",

We finished our drinks and I had to wave down our sever who was talking at the bar to another server or person who worked there. He said oh I saw you, I was talking. I replied that he should have acknowledge me as I was waving my arm around for a minute trying to get his attention. He should have at least looked my way in acknowledgement. I really do not like to have to wave down a server when we are one of three tables in the restaurant and the only one in his section. Then we asked the other server waiting the table across from if he could check for our food because we had been waiting so long. And it came out warm not hot.   So long story short. Foods great. Service sucks. I guess that is what happens when you have high school and college kids working for you not professionals or people who truly care about your business.",

I grew up in the neighborhood and my mom lives within walking distance. We made a reservation for a table for 6 to celebrate her 65th birthday. When we arrived, a hostess didn't greet us for at least 5 minutes. We were sat and ordered beverages while deciding what to order. As we started to place orders our server informed us they were out of everything we had in mind. It's worth mentioning these were common items: Tenderloin, Fresh Catch, Chicken Fingers, Etc. She made no attempt to offer alternate dishes. We made the decision to leave for another restaurant but attempted to order Pretzel Bites to finish our drinks and tide my daughters over until we could get to our next place. They were out of those too!  They blamed it on a busy weekend. When we left and explained why to the manager on duty, she was apologetic and gave us a free boat ride coupon but made no attempt to comp our check or offer anything further. The GM was supposed to call my sister the next day but never did. It's a shame to see a non-franchised and local restaurant fail at service and food quality. I'm not sure my mom, her nearby friends or I will ever be back.",

The restaurant was nice and clean and our waiter was very kind. The food on the other hand was terrible. We ordered pretzel bites for $9 they came out look like they were microwaved from frozen and the size of a quarter dark brown extremely chewy and with neon yellow cheese to dip in. I never sent things back to the kitchen but we told him we were not going to eat it so he took it away. On the other hand we ordered the fish and chips the fish was nice it was battered with a different concoction and the tartar sauce was different but nice as well. We were excited to try the hickima Apple coleslaw. Except when it came out it was traditional coleslaw and which had no flavor and was wilted, we didn't eat that either. Our waiter took off the cost of the pretzel bites and we simply told him they were not good. He was a nice guy but it is such a bummer because this restaurant has such potential I have been there 3 times in the last 2 years and everytime its bad food. I would not recommend this place. Unless you catered from another company and rented it out for the atmosphere. Also pier 52 which is next door has very poor food as well. Once again it's unfortunate cuz they are cool places.",

I was a little concerned about the price when I booked the party, but figured it would be worth it, as the place is beautiful and location perfect, they probably know what they're doing. Nope. NOT the kitchen staff, and DEFINITELY not who is in charge of letting such unappealing, low end product out of the kitchen. I was wrong to assume that because they because have a Special Events Menu and great ambiance, that the food would be awesome. So wrong. I would be embarrassed to serve, not to mention charge, for that garbage. The service was there, but with low energy. I felt like every time I looked around, there were friends and family with empty drinks and empty cups/glassware in front of them. We left the Watershed feeling like we just got bent over the barrel and paid top dollar for it.",

Our server was friendly and the place was not busy besides our party however he was our server and what seemed to be the bartender as well which meant everything took 3x as long. My friend ordered a burger medium with fries and it took over 30 minutes, came with chips, the girl who dropped it off said she would be back with fries but never did. Another member of our table ordered the chips, guacamole, and queso. It came out as just chips and salsa...then eventually the queso...not sure if they ever received the quac.  Since I noticed everything was taking forever I opted for the buffet. The man working over there was extremely friendly and mentioned the buffet was new. The flow was extremely awkward and it would of been nice to have signs that said what everything was.  The only good item on the buffet was the enchiladas, they were AMAZING. That should be put on the menu full time.   Once the other guests received their food everything was delicious.   I could understand if we should up unannounced with that large of group and the staff being overwhelmed however many people we were with mentioned that the service is always that slow and unorganized.  I would only come back for the view and a cocktail.",

Now, besides the childish servers making constant noises moving around tables and stools(learn to pick up the damn chair instead of sliding it) and the subpar under to over seasoned food served to me and my party, this place does one thing well. Sucking. You may be enamored by the lake front view, but under the smoke and mirrors watershed is another generalize pop american restaurant that tries to recreate some classical favorites such as fish and chips, into a garbage excuse of food. Seems like under/over seasoning is a constant trend since even my water receive more lemon than my fish and chips.",

    "text": "I chose the Watershed this weekend for Brunch as a result of a Groupon that was recently offered.  Several months ago, another friend and I had visited this spot for dessert and coffee and at that time I was impressed by the atmosphere, friendly staff and tasty dessert offerings.  So it seemed the perfect place to gather with a couple of other friends for an informal birthday get-together. Unfortunately, my previous pleasant experience was not duplicated today.    We requested outdoor seating to enjoy the cooler weather and were looking forward to hearing the sounds of nature during our conversation. Instead, we were treated to the thumping bass line of the stereo blasted from speakers hanging above every outdoor table.  Despite asking THREE times for the music to be lowered we never were able to hold a conversation in anything other than raised voices.  Outdoor, waterside, Sunday brunch is not compatible with a nightclub music mix, in my opinion.   Although the food was of reasonable quality, it seemed overpriced. There was nothing noteworthy about it in terms of originality of flavor or creativity in presentation.  I could have spent half as much money on a similar breakfast at Denny's and gotten comparable food.  The wait staff was attentive as far as taking our order, getting the food to us in a timely manner and keeping our beverage glasses full.  The decor was inviting and beckoned the patron to \"come in and stay awhile.\"  Unfortunately, the noise drove us away and the food did nothing to compel me to return.",

    "text": "This is what I sent the manager after our company party at the end of 2017. I have given them multiple opportunities to make it right and they have just brushed it off every time The manager even argued the point that what happened did not happen. I really only want them to do what they said they were going to do and refund you appropriate monies that they overcharged us let alone the bad service.   Dan,   We made arrangements for our company party to be held at your facility on Dec. 14. I read the communications you and he had while setting this up and you were cordial and helpful. I appreciate that. I would like to give you some feedback about the service. First off let me say that Adelle did a great job with the drinks! She was very attentive and kept up with everything all evening in a very professional manner. The facility itself was good overall with the exception of the \"dart patio\" not having any darts. There was one dart. We asked one of the staff where the darts were and he just said the last party might have broken them and shrugged us off. That's not a huge deal really but it would have been nice to have what was expected. Now here is the thing that fell flat. The food. The \"buffet\" that we paid big money for was a monumental let down. First off it was not ready until about 45 minutes after it should have been, then there was a very small amount of food presented. When a very small amount of food is presented is suggests to the guests that there might not be enough for everyone so they should not eat as much as they would like to. This was supposed to be a buffet. There were to be over fifty people there and only a tiny bowl of toppings and small containers the other foods  were placed out on the serving table. The toppings quickly ran out and we had to ask over and over again for them to be refilled. In fact I asked for the salsa to be refilled three times myself over a 20 minute period and never got any!  I also think that there should have been a better selection of toppings. There wasn't any sour cream which I think is a staple for fajitas. The food quality was subpar overall. I feel that a Filibertos meal would have been far better. It's really not hard to get buffet style Mexican food right. While the meat fillings and salad were good, the enchiladas were dry and skimpy and toppings lacking. Additionally the only bowl of salad put out ran out and was not replenished. On top of that your staff served the food which I understand is done to control portions but it was absolutely ridiculous how very little they gave each person. It was as if there was some kind of strict rationing going on! Several people asked if there was a problem with the food because there just was hardly any there and the staff was being super stingy with it. My own daughter said she was hungry to have some more but they were putting it away. A few minutes later I went up to see if it really was being put away because it hadn't been out very long and sure enough it was all gone. I know that everyone did not get enough to eat. This was quite surprising especially considering that seven of our expected guests didn't make it. There should have been a ton of leftover food. Again, I didn't expect \"the world\" or something extravagant here, just what we paid for. I feel like we paid a \"Cadillac\" price and got a \"Hyundai\" product. We spent over $3,000.00 with you! If we had been charged $12 per person then I wouldn't be complaining, but when you charge $35 per person then you had better 'bring it' with the food, especially if it's Mexican food which is very cheap to prepare. Again, I hate to complain like this and I almost never do and I feel like a jerk for so doing but I was actually embarrassed to have our holiday party there. That has never happened to me before. You need to know what happened just like I need to know when one of my work crews drops the ball and doesn't deliver a quality product. We are in the service industry too and I know that our company has dropped the ball before with our customers. Nobody's perfect and I don't expect perfection but when this happens I do my best within reason to make it right. I am asking you to make this right by refunding a minimum of $500.00 to our company for the lack of acceptable service. When I post this review on line I would like to point out that your company took care of us so we can feel right about doing business with you and recommending you to associates in the future. Please feel free to call me if you would like to discuss the matter and how to make it better in the future from a customer's point of view. I'm reasonable and wouldn't mind it at all.   Sincerely, Clint General manager",

We waited in line for at least an hour just waiting to get through the line and then waiting on more food to come out. It was most definitely a waste of time and money. I came out feeling very hungry and ended up making food at home afterwards. You would think they would have food prepared for when it runs out but I guess not. I haven't been there for a regular meal but when I go I will update this review.",

    "text": "This was the first time my wife and I went there and sorry to say this will be our last. We got there shortly after 11, they open at 11 and was quickly led to our table . Its a nice looking restaurant and great views overlooking a small lake in the Tempe Lakes subdivision. We order our lunch, I odered waffles and chicken and Emma ordered the blackened mahi. At that point we waited and waited and waited some more for our lunch to arrive. It never did. After almost 30 minutes of waiting our waitress finally made an appearance. I asked where our lunch was and she said it would be comming out soon that we were second on the list with only 1 table in front of us. At that point she disappeared once again. After another 5 minute wait I went up to rhe hostess station and asked if they could find our food. I thought it was odd that the hostess knew what we ordered. She told me that chicken and blackened mahi take a long time to prepare. I walked back to our table and noticed the table that ordered before us hadn't received their food either. At that point we left $7 on the table for the body mary Emma had and walked out. No one said anything to us including the hostess as we walked right past her. It's quite obvious this restaurant has serious kitchen problems. That explained the emptiness of the restaurant even though it's in a prime location. No reason for us ever to go back",

    "text": "It's Arizona's peak summertime but the view remains great even though the hot weather limits their overall hours.   Came here for a client meeting in the afternoon as I knew what to expect from the atmosphere. It has a good low-stress vibe that allowed for good conversation, drinks, and appetizers.   The hours are shortened during the summer so it's only open 4-9pm Tuesday through the weekend and will expand once the weather cools down the beginning of September.  Typically when you come to the restaurant you look forward to the sunset views of the lake, atmosphere and outdoor seating. With the hot weather, the tour boat is not scheduled to run and I don't blame them as it would the blazing temps would overpower the experience.   We ordered a couple cocktails that included the Sangria, Moscow Mule, and draft beer all of which were part of Happy Hour. We later ordered a couple of the appetizers that included the nachos (which we split with chicken & beef) along with the calamari to go with it. I didn't pay to much attention to the food as I busy talking most of the time, but my clients enjoyed.  We sat in the bar area where they have plenty of TVs. Bar is fully loaded and has a nice selection to choose from... and what I consider to be reasonably priced. Staff on hand was limited, but they are attentive which we appreciated throughout the meeting/meal.   This place has so much potential so I hope they make it more inviting in the coming months as the weather cools down. The location and potential opportunities can make it a True Tempe gem. 3.5  and I plan to return in the fall for brunch & happy hours!",

We came in on a Sunday (not expecting to have to make reservations) and the gentleman at the front said that they would not be able to seat us, because they were short staffed and they were only taking reservations. Keep in mind this was for my wife's birthday, and I didn't want to disappoint her. I asked to speak to a manager. Adele was GREAT and said that she would be able to seat us, but that the service may be a little slower because they were short staffed. I let her know that we were patient.....still crazy to think that they almost let us walk out the door.  We were told that they would squeeze us in between reservations, but the bartender (Jasmine) ended up waiting on us. She was AWESOME!! Was able to take care of the bar and also make sure that our drinks were never empty and we we left happy.  The chicken and waffles were amazing (please give me the recipe for the sweet/heat syrup ) and the Cajun stroganoff was amazing as well (....and yes they make homemade noodles).  Overall.....they never skipped a beat, and I was impressed with the great service we received on this busy day.",

    "text": "Honestly, I have no pros for the Watershed, only cons.  I booked my reservation for the Watershed online via Yelp for a party of 14 for my Meet Up Group's \"White Elephant Brunch\" a whole month before the date.  Pictures on the website looks so enticing.  It looks like it would be a lot of fun.  Would be! The date was Sunday, December 17th, 2017.  Someone from the Watershed called to confirm the reservation on Thursday, December 14th, 2017.  They asked what our final count, if we wanted to be inside or outside, and confirmed the time (11:30am).  I said Yes!  We're super excited ... see you guys Sunday.  Sunday morning, about 10:15am, someone from the Watershed called me back again to confirm my reservation for the second time.  She again asked if we wanted to be seated inside or outside.  I arrived at 11:30 on the dot.  The hostess said there's 2 members of your party waiting over there.  We're getting your table together. I said ... Oh ok!  Will it take a long time because you guys called to confirm everything with me twice.  The hostess said, just a few moments.  A few moments turned into us not being seated until after 12:00, about 12:10.  There was absolutely no sense of urgency to accommodate my party.  The hostess told us we'd be seated in the Captains Circle (or something like that).  We were told to stand in that area until the hostess pushed tabled together (by herself).    Once we were seated, we received menus immediately.  We all ordered waters and mimosas to start.  We received our mimosas, our waters didn't hit the table until 12:30 Guys!!!  12:30.  I can't remember the name of our server, but perhaps she should have had someone help her with our party of 14.  While taking everyone's orders, we also took everyone's name.  It appears she took everyone's orders correctly.  Everyone's food started coming out, everyone except for 3 people.  A different server told us the missing plates were on their way.  Minutes passed, nothing.  We flagged down our initial server and asked about the few missing plates.  She admitted that she completely forgot to put their orders in.  How?!  You took everyone's order by name.  How?!    Again, there was no sense of urgency at all to accommodate us.  My section wasn't ready.  We received water 30 mins after being seated.  Out of 14, only 11 of us received our dishes in a timely manner.  Because of this I will not visit the Watershed again.  Ever again!",

We were received by a fly around the table, and the server joked that there's always one in that corner.   We had some delicious cocktails and the Loaded Green Chile Fries appetizer, which were really good; this was promising to be a good dinner. And then it went downhill.  We waited for a while for our entree, and that's where we were extremely disappointed; my fiance's Gumbo was bland, and the shrimp he paid extra as an add-on was chewy. I got the Salmon with Garlic mash; over cooked and bland. I had asked for a second cocktail while waiting for the meal which I never got, and halfway through my meal the server came to tell me they ran out of one of the main ingredients, and if I wanted anything else. I opted for water that took a long time to come without ice. All the while the fly was around us...   My recommendation: come during Happy Hour and get drinks and appetizers while listening to nice live music, but don't waste money on the main dishes.",

    "text": "So, reservations made well in advance for a party of approx 20 guests for my sister in laws birthday celebration. We arrive at our 11 am reservation time. We are seated on the patio with a great view of the water. The location is really nice. Now, location does not necessarily make everything else great , in particular the service.  Initially first things I noticed were no silverware on the tables. The time we waited to even order drinks was a bit long but that's OK people are still arriving. We finally received our drinks and at that time orders were placed approximately 35-40 minutes after 11 AM. Our waitress whom I was informed was new to this establishment did not seem very sure of herself and disorganized, but maybe it was her first job so I can't put it all on her.  Now, it has been an hour since everyone ordered and still no explanation when our meals would arrive. I was told by the waitress, \"soon.\" Soon came and went and now we are at 90 minutes since orders were placed. I approached an employee inside,  whom I believe was the lead busboy. I again asked what the delay could be with our order and he explained that the chef was out of town. Now am not a chef, or, privy to the goings-on in the kitchen but I'm sure he's not the only chef on the payroll. This employee I had spoken with, (lead busboy?) came to me and told me that the manager would soon be over to talk with us regarding the delays and our displeasure with the service so far. This manager we were expecting to see never appeared throughout the entire time of our penance there.   To summarize the service was terrible. Not everyone even received their meals that we're ordered, even after the two hour wait!? There was a discount of 25% for the meals but, there was an ad on of 20% for their \"quality service?\"  No one ever explained to us any reason why our food was late. At the minimum the manager should've come and addressed our table and explain the situation so that we were all informed instead of making up our own assumptions and trying to find out piece by piece from various employees wandering about the establishment. Just excuses.... terrible experience for all of us, especially my sister in law whom was the reason we all came to celebrate her birthday.  If you still decide to go to this place and \" try your luck,\" I recommend sit at the bar. This will help ease your pain. You've been warned...",

Then when I mention it, she takes it back to the kitchen to have it re made but they bring the same one back with a side of guac, the guac was soupy like out of a package.  This was a$15 sandwich, so when I say I don't want it, they offer nothing. We had to ask them to remove it from the bill. First they removed the charge for a$5 beer.  We had to ask them to remove the sandwich which they did reluctantly. Moral of the story is, go for drinks and the view but skip eating there. The little outside venue next door is very good.

We came on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was pretty empty, yet there was no one to seat us, no one to take our order, and we waited awhile for our food and checks.   My friend and I both ordered glasses of wine - she ordered a 9 ounce glass and I ordered a six. However, when our glasses came the pours were the exact same. We're still not sure if we got six or nine ounce pours.   I had the Southwest Salad and it was average at best. The dressing was described on the menu as a cilantro lime vinaigrette but it was really just a cup of olive oil.   Our waitress was always nowhere to be found, which is surprising considering there was maybe two or three other tables in the restaurant.   The bathrooms had an off putting smell and there was no trash can so all of the paper towels were being piled up by the sink.   They do have an extensive cocktail list, so in the future we may just come to enjoy the view and sip on a drink.",

They offered two seating times- 11 and 2 - but waited to seat everyone at the same time! Staggering your seat times would have eliminated the long lines for food and they weren't ready at 11 to serve anyway! The food was cold and because they dished it up for you- it made it hard to go back for only items you wanted more of because the lines were so long! Allowing people to dish up from both sides of the table would get people through quicker- It was clear they wanted to monitor the expensive food!! My husband got one slice of cold steak and he said it was bland- No salt/pepper on the tables until we were nearly finished and no hot sauce for the eggs...We had to pay extra for mimosas- at $48 for a one time through buffet, they could have at least thrown in the mimosas for free or limited cost! 18% gratuity added automatically made the servers not really care if we were happy- total rip off- I'd never do that again! There are too many other places to choose from - The views are gorgeous- but not at that price",

Service was inattentive and very slow (Food was served after TWO hours!! and not all at once) Food was over priced for what you get and taste was nothing exceptional.  I'm pretty flexible and understanding when you see a restaurant busy and the staff doing all they can,  but this was not the case. The place was basically empty and we had to track staff down to ask for straws drink refills and updates on our food. Salt and pepper were not even on the tables. The venue is beautiful, very sad that the service and food don't even come close to measuring up. I would not recommend.",

We are both relatively quiet and low-key people. I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was on a Friday night. Also, I was shocked when 2 vodka drinks was $11! I live on the east coast and 1 vodka drink is usually $15! The music wasn't too loud, the bartender and staff were friendly, the vodka was too notch and the atmosphere is amazing. Right on a lake and the outdoor patio was stunning. I will definitely be returning here during my next trip to Phoenix!",

Also had several Hurricanes on happy hour - very tasty and \"effective\" ;)  We sat on the patio on the afternoon with a little wind and the umbrellas are not weighted down, so be careful that they don't fall on you.

Beautiful patio, beautiful view, corn hole games, darts, billiards and a great menu. I am not sure if our group overwhelmed the staff, but we had a few big misses in service. Incredibly friendly staff, but just struggled to get things correct. Meals were incorrect for a few of our party. Solutions were so slow that we passed on a couple of the efforts (like missing chicken on the chicken nachos...the chicken was brought out nearly 30 minutes after we reported the missing key ingredient). Another member ordered a salmon salad and when all the meals were delivered we were told they didn't have any salmon. Another meat was selected and then 15 minutes later a salad arrived with a big junk of salmon on top....weird. Prices were HIGH too! Those nachos with no chicken were $13. Anyways, go for a nice spot to get drinks but don't expect the execution in the kitchen to match the scenery.",

We stopped in for a \"quick\" bite with our kids, when we tried to put an order in after our server finally showed up having already been waiting for over 15 min at a table, the appetizer never came.... we waited another 10-15 min to receive waters, and then finally had the opportunity to order our meal only to wait another 45min for the incomplete food order.... The completely ineffectual manager awkwardly came to apologize for our crappy experience... only he never actually did apologize.... He gave an excuse of being understaffed, which might explain the slow service, but not the poor attitude  from the nearly non-existent service. This place is a waste of an amazing location. I feel robbed of my time and my money, I will not be back, and I will tell pretty much everyone to stay away. Like all the places before it.... this one appears to be another bust.",

We had the nachos which was very plain. We also had queso dip which after one minute on the table turned rock hard since it was just regular cheese just melted. We tried their chicken skewers which were pretty good. I can't comment on their main course dishes because I've only had apps but I've heard they are great.

After the novelty had worn off, we didn't go for a while until a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, the food got even worse, much worse. Won't go again unless there are dramatic changes to the quality of the food, the management, the menu, and the drinks (totally watered down).

I scoped out their grilled cheese and a side of fries. My mom got the red chile salad w shrimp. Our server was quick, friendly and kept our glasses topped off which I always appreciate.  The food came out within 10 minutes. Perfectly presented, and i really have to say it: for a grilled cheese w fries it was Beautiful. Perfectly done. And the taste! Out of this world. I haven't had a meal exceed my expectations like this grilled cheese did in a long time! They use some amazing herbs and the cheese blend is fantastic!  Fries were Cajun spicy! Addictive! Ma's salad was fantastic, the grilled shrimp perfectly grilled and marinated. Her words: \"i would eat this again for dinner tonight if I could.\"   Bread pudding for desert!

We went for Happy Hour, but they currently only have drink specials, no food specials. Would be nice if they have some food specials to keep up with what other places are doing for h.h. $1  off beer & specialty cocktails and $5 house cocktails and wine. Hours for Happy Hr. are 3pm to 6pm, T-F. We had the cobb salad for $13. which was good, but was advertised as having jalapeno buttermilk ranch dressing and I expected a little spice from it, there was no spice at all. Tasted just like ranch. We also had the burger which was $10. and came with a choice of toppings and a side like fries. I think there were other choices of sides, but I can't recall now. The server was friendly and gave us separate checks,which is a must in a large group!  The view is nice as it is on a lake and the \"party\" boats came out about sunset and was fun to watch all the boaters. The inside of the place is still under going renovations,but there is seating inside as well. There are quite a few steps to get to the patio, but there are a few ramps inside to get you to the patio. The inside bar looks like a great place when they finish with it.  I will be back soon, but probably will eat inside as the weather in the Phoenix area is heating up. The place was quite busy for mid week at 4:30pm,we wanted the area with backs to the chairs,but the area was already full by the time we arrived.(patio)  Dan-please add some food happy hour specials.",

They have pool tables and other things to entertain yourself with while you wait for food, and the Lakeside view is beautiful.   The staff is very friendly and down to earth. Ask for Aaron. He knows the menu and will tell you his honest opinion on the items. He also talks to you like another person and cares about your experience instead of acting like you're just another customer like most people do.   Definitely recommend this place. It's easy to miss, but you'd miss out not trying it!",

    "text": "We enjoyed a great Friday evening with a buddy here & listened to a guitar player who took requests.  Just about every seat has a good view of the lake. The patio books fast & we landed a window table with a view.  Happy Hour is from 3-6 Mon through Fri.  We had good quality wines for $5 & good chicken tacos & chicken flatbread for $5. This place has better happy hour foods compared to other restaurants.  Our server, Janice, was very professional & provided great suggestions.  Also, she let us know about the boat tours. She was attentive without being intrusive which is a rare quality.  BTW, boat tours are $5 per person.  Parking can be a challenge but don't be discouraged since a parking area next door is available.  With the great wine prices you might want to Uber or Lyft here.  Two thumbs up for the Watershed.",

    "text": "We took some out of town relatives to the Watershed last weekend in the afternoon. We hadn't been there in some time.  We sat in the bar area.  Despite the fact that there were 3 staff members standing near the bar no one came to offer us service.  During our stay we had to go to the bar each time to get our own drinks...however the bartender did find time to bring our bill over on 2 occasions.  Our relatives ordered loaded baked potatoes costing nearly  $12.00....what they got were 4 halves of  the smallest driest potatoes I have ever seen! The taste was like cardboard!  The bar area looks like it should be on a dive bar tour.  Loose hanging wires all over the place.  The Watershed needs a knowledgeable manager that cares and/or an owner that is willing to spend a little money and elbow grease to class up the place.  The location is perfect in The Lakes with a fantastic view!  What a shame to look like this on the inside and provide this low level of service.  With only one dish ordered I cannot comment on the other food, although I will say that the menu looks like it came from an actual dive bar.  The bathroom was dirty and uncared for too.    Please fix this place up so we can be proud to take guests there again.",

I ordered  coffee, first the coffee came out, then the Splenda, then the cream....all punctuated by long (all least 15 minutes) waits despite it being relatively empty. A Coke was no better, nor the iced tea. Then to the food......half of it was cold, the other part inedible.  There were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast strips, plus a variety of pastas, pork, Mexican dishes, etc....all either cold, congealed or inedible. Obviously, they are in search of the bar business and the food was secondary.  Won't be going back.",

My husband and I owned an Italian restaurant in San Diego for 11 years. When we were super busy we ALWAYS greeted our customers with a smile. Not once did we get that.  We were told to go out to the patio and wait for our table. Ok, we ordered drinks that took 20 minutes at the bar to get. Meanwhile I sat outside with the dog. There were 5 empty tables, I finally saw the hostess who said that the place we were sitting someone else requested to sit there, she asked if we had our name on the list???? You took our name!!!! Basically  at that point we left.... They need to educate their staff on friendliness. Get a manager that cares and maybe it will run smoother. Never going back. Oh plus it smelled like rotten eggs.",

In fact, we owned a small sail boat, and when the wind was okay, I would sail in for a beer and appetizer.   Way cool.   Of course the restaurant has changed owners and themes many times since then. Some for better, some not.  The current theme of sports bar works all good with me.  I still like the place. And the food is okay, a little more expensive than most bar food. But we are also paying for the scenery.  Beautiful back in the day, beautiful now.  NOTE: Read my other numerous reviews for tips, entertainment, and historic references. Thank you, Tim B.",

I'm actually surprised to see the reviews everyone else wrote as we did not have any issues with slowness, staff, or food.  There were very few things that this place is lacking.  My husband and I have already agreed we will go back again.  I cannot say if this is an everyday occurrence but at the day and time we came in. It was an older crowd, which was nice for us as we are older people.  The band that was playing was actually really great and we commented more than once on how good they were.  All of the servers seem very young which makes sense as the establishment is very close to the ASU campus.   Everyone was professional however and I was impressed to see such great service.  Overall feel is very laid back.  Definitely not a place you need to wear your Sundays finest but could if you wanted to.     Pros:  Great Food Menu Beautiful views of a lake Excellent Service  Live music every Friday Good beer selection Reasonable pricing Boat rides offered in the winter Good service Easy Parking  Cons: Older establishment.  Would be amazing with a few upgrades here and there.   Older AC system.  Definitely felt a little warm here and there throughout the evening  Mosquitoes on the patio",

Management only cares about money. A party of 5. My mom 87. I wanted this to be a special day for her. So...i called Sunday after got home to complain, no one was available when we're leaving. Left voice mail. No return call. Sent email. Nothing. Called Tuesady. Nothing. Sent message on the web site-contact us. NOTHING. The food was not ready until 11:20. Had to WAIT to go through a buffet. The dessert and salad table had no plates. You had to break through the line to get one then come back. No salt and pepper which from reviews is normal and managment must not read.  That could be an easy fix. No soup spoons. Had to ask 3 different people. Not all items posted on menus were put out. Oh wait...yeah they did they added meatloaf. Biscuits and gravy and chicken.  To the end of line. You watched them set up a table add cloth then food .  did they know the place was open at 11! And to not have it ready.UNACCEPTABLE.  Had to WAIT IN A HORRIBLE LONG LINE ALL OVER AGAIN.  I had been getting the food for my mom and by the time I got back she said she was done. The steak was rubbery and raw. Meat loaf had more mixed vegetables. Bland test. Brought water in paper cups. Charged for coffee!!! And I paid a grutuity for waiting in lines. Serving myself and our table. I should of gotten that! 5 adults. 4 coffee Bailey. I regular coffee. Plus charged for 1 boat ride. $367.12. Omgosh. Think where we could of went ANYWHERE. Had better food better service and had money left over.  No one there cares. They will NOT be in business long. To many of the same reviews over and over. They are scamming all the first timers.

On their website there is mention of special seating for packers fans but doesn't explain this fully. Also in my opinion that's poor business and extremely petty lol I assume the manager or owner only wants packer fans in his establishment but hey that's you're lost especially when there is other bars in the area that will gladly take the business of other NFL fans. Bottom line is this looks a great place to get some good food and drinks on a non football day unless you're a packers fan don't waste you're time coming here for the game. I recommend Dave and busters in Tempe they have huge screens everywhere and take everyone. I'll post another review once I actually eat at this place I travel a lot and live in California though.",

Brunch is delicious here and you can beat the $15 bottle of mimosa. We have never actually done the boat ride but everyone always looks pleased with the ride around the lake. Downside here is parking but there is a lot next door which maybe easier that there actual parking lot.",

I'm not exaggerating; cheese looked super old, wilted lettuce and hard, cold bread.. just garbage. Thankfully they made it right and brought me a fresh sandwich; WHAT a difference! We had to ask for our server multiple times and each time it took forever for her to arrive.   Anyway.. I was happy to be there with the awesome company i had and we were seated at a table with a GORGEOUS view. I just wish this place was better all around. I have zero intention of returning. I sincerely hope the best for the Watershed because the location is really beautiful. Best of luck.",

We took the first bite before we knew this and could just taste the blood from the steak. Then we cut the steak right in half and notice it is completely RAW. The rice was undercooked and dry. It was just sad because we had a table by the lake we got to see the sunset which was beautiful but this totally ruined the dinner. I hope that this place is able to improve their food quality because everything else was pleasant.",

We ordered the salmon plate based on a picture/review from a yelper on this page; it was terrible. The salmon and the accompaniments were dry. The clam chowder was bland and had no flavor. Lastly, the cheese curds would have been ok, but tasted mealy and were not fresh. We took a few bites of everything but it was not up to standards. The server and manager were great and listened to our concerns and did not charge us for the food. I wish the food was better because we loved the view, drinks, and live music.",

    "text": "I really had hoped to love this spot. This is such a cool location in Tempe. It's too bad that the restaurant is utterly mismanaged. I took my mom and brother for dinner tonight and nearly every aspect of the service was poor. Host staff clearly had little experience in helping to accommodate someone in a wheelchair. I can understand this but then involve us in the process-we live this and can support you if the location is accessible.. EG. I could tell you a booth isn't ideal and rather a table with a chair removed is better. (This was after she lead us to a table outside that was only accessible by stairs. Nope. But we made the booth work although that meant helping my brother out of his chair and into the booth... leaving the chair in the aisle/pathway of food runners etc.   Wait staff was slow, didn't know the menu and then the poor guy had to return to our table no less than 3 times telling us either that he was mistaken about menu options and/or were out of that beer and that beer and that one too. It was a Saturday night, early... which suggests a lack of responsible inventory orders. Even after we ordered our drinks they took forever to arrive.   If we thought the wait for drinks was bad.... our meals took longer with absolutely no updates or communication. It took So long that we eventually got up to find the server and ask. \"Oh the kitchen Is backed up.\" Yea I could've guessed that. The place had a fair number of active tables but it also wasn't packed. And at no point did any of the service staff appear to be under any pressure or urgency to be of service. And as a former server myself I know that when the kitchen is THAT backed up you check in and tell your tables, apologize and reassure them it'll be out as soon as possible. And at that point, managers step in and do some goodwill visits too. But none of that happened.   When the food finally arrived. It was fine, average. Nothing worth waiting the 40 + minutes. we had a pasta dish a sandwich and a quesadilla.... nothing requiring an extended grill time.   I give 2 stars bc the location is beautiful and has so much potential. And bc although the service was awful, our waiter seemed like a nice person. Simply a nice person with zero training or support from Mgmt. It's too bad bc the spot has so much potential. Very disappointing.",

Most recently, I had the lunch chicken sandwich- it was good, a little dry, but well seasoned and it had a good crunch. It also came on the pillowiest brioche bun ever. The real star of the plate were the crunchiest fries I've ever had! They're good enough to eat as a meal on their own. My husband had the classic breakfast- eggs, breakfast potatoes, toast, and bacon. The bacon was super thick and perfectly crunchy, the potatoes seemed like they might be freezer potatoes but were still good, and the eggs were good as well. They also have an AMAZING deal for brunch where you get a bottle of sparkling wine and your choice of juice for mimosas and it's only $15!!! Take my advice-  go when it's nice outside, sit on the deck by the water, order the mimosa and the biggest plate of fries they'll give you.",

What a mistake, from being told the empty tables on the patio deck were reserved (yet no one was seated at them for the entire 1.5 hours we were there), to the tri tip on bun with a small amount of fatty meat - served cold as was the tiny serving of \"au jus\" which was more like slightly flavored water), to not receiving the 2nd entree until about 45 minutes after the first person was served, and then only after walking inside to find someone who could find out where our food was...to a waitress claiming we only ordered one entree (for 2 people), to being told by 3 people that they would send the manager over to our table - when we kept saying we didn't need to see a manager, we just wanted the rest of our food order...to the manager who finally showed up being condescending and not even offering to comp our food, or at least the 2 glasses of wine...ugh! I hate to write a bad review, don't recall ever doing so, but enough is enough and until/unless this place offers more than a lovely waterfront view I cannot see how they stay in business.",

Service was the worst I've experienced in a very long time...gorgeous setting but, food was barely mediocre and the restaurant suffered from extremely poor management.  This HUGE restaurant has a total of 3 high chairs so, our day started badly since 2 of the 3 chairs were being used and we had two babies with us.  20 minutes went by, so I went inside and asked them to send us a server...5 minutes later he showed up and took our drink and appetizer order...we should have run then.  It took another 10 minutes before the drinks arrived.  Oh, did I say the appetizer failed to ever appear?  It took nearly an hour before our food arrived...no kidding.  No silverware...no appetizer...virtually no service and to add insult, the food was nothing special at all.  It's not hard to see the problem--horribly weak leadership, failure to be connected to the community (it was Santa day on the island and predictably busier than usual), poor training of host and serving staff, no available kid's menu, no silverware, well, it was basically a whole lot of nothing that cost $51.  I spoke to the manager and expressed our displeasure and to his credit he offered us a gift certificate for future use, but frankly it doesn't deserve a 2nd try.  He should have comp'd the meal or at least discounted it, but nope--oh, that would be another nothing which describes our experience.  Shame on them on so many levels...stay far away.",

Very impressive views of the water and an awesome outdoor seating area.  It was raining when we went, so we sat indoors.  Everyone from the hostess to the servers were very friendly and sincere.  Started with a cocktail and ended up ordering dinner.  I had the beef tacos with beans and rice.  Wife had enchiladas.  All was good except the rice was crunchy (undercooked).  Other than that, we really had a great time.  The G.M. stopped by our table to ask how everything was and asked if there was anything they could do better. An obvious nod to some of the \"less than stellar\" online/Yelp reviews.  Big kudos to him for taking the time to ask.  Lastly, note that this place is still being worked on and is not a \"finished product\" yet.  I look forward to returning and wish The Watershed lots of success!",

By time we wanted to order we found out that the had one waitress assigned to our group which was about eighty people (despite the fact that we had called ahead to book our party). We ordered and it took on average 45 minutes to get our food and our drinks arrived just before the food. Our waitress was nice but there was no excuse for how they mismanaged the situation.  The food was only okay, some orders never came and all we were told was that they \"must not have been entered into the system\" and we had to remind them to give us silverware. I would not go back here again. Horrible service and sub-par food.",

    "text": "I've been 3 times now becasue its close to home and very comfortable and the food and drinks were really good. So we thought stopping in on Valentines Day would be okay for a quick drink and bite to eat. NOT!  Get there at 5:20ish, only a few couples on the patio (20% capacity).  The hostess stops us and askes if we have a reservation, I responded \"No\", she then said it would be a few minutes.  Ok.  The place is practically empty, it's been 10 min, a waitress we had the week before says sorry to us and that she's not sure why we can't be seated.  Other couples walk in, no reservations as well and hostess tells them it will be a few minutes.  She then looks at me and says it'll be awhile, what happened to a few minutes?  Did I mention the place is practically empty?  No bar, still being built and can't even get drinks to wait.  I send my boyfriend next door to Pier 54 (which we frequent alot) to look for an empty table, which he calls to tell me he finds.  I then look at hostess to tell her not to bother, we have a table next door adn walk out.  We end up having a lovely evening on the water, live music and Great Service.  Not sure why the Watershed hostess was rude and doesn't know how to organize the timimng of occupants to tables.  She kept saying everything was reserved.  Sitting next door, we watched the onslaught of reservations for the Watershed arrive only for them to not find parking and it was close to 6:30pm.  We could have been in and out in that one hour.  I've had other resurants inform us their busy, but we could have a table if we finished before the next reservation time.  No such thing offered here.  It's back to Pier 54, who is reliable and hires qualified staff.",

It was happy hour so we ordered a couple things off the menu. The waiter came back and forth 2 times to let us know that the menu item we chose were out. They were kind enough to give us a free menu item because of the blunder. I don't mind that part much but the food was not very good. I had fish tacos, which had fried fish balls. It was dry, fishy and tasted like it was frozen. It came on 2 layers of very greasy corn tortillas. The beans and rice on the side were mediocre. The free food, which was back ribs, was not very good either. It tasted gamey and just smothered in sauce. I will say they have the best cole slaw I have ever had. Instead of being super mayo-y, it tasted fresh, unique, almost like vinaigrette, and I loved it. I guess I am giving one star for the cole slaw, and one star for the nice view. Unfortunately, I know I won't be coming back.",

Noting the other reviews, we thought the service might be a risk but while there we found the service to be excellent.  In addition, the atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable when we were there for lunch on Saturday.  There was live music in the bar, but we were not too impressed and chose to sat in the dining room.",

We got there  at 9:00 AM when they opened and when they unlocked the door and let us in you could tell they were annoyed, they didn't greet us or anything. It didn't seem that anyone was ready for customers, coffee wasn't brewed the only thing ready was water. After we ordered another table was seated, fast forward 45 minutes that table had their food while we still did not.We had to ask for refills on our beverages multiple times which also took much longer than it should have. The food was average, not good enough to makeup for the service or overall experience. The restaurant was not busy at all (employees were sitting at the bar talking), in the 2 hours we were there we were one 4-5 tables really no excuse for the service we had. As if all this wasn't disappointing enough the bathrooms were filthy, they had not been cleaned from the night before. Very unpleasant visit, we won't be back to try again.",

Sister-in-law had soft tacos which were mediocre at best.   I had a New Mexican dish per recommendation of our server and it was average at best.  Bar area was packed.  My guess is if you go for drinks and appetizers you will enjoy this place.  Management need to upgrade quality of entre's.  Sent an email via Facebook of our experience and never heard a word back.",

    "text": "The view is the only redeeming thing about this place.  We made a reservation on line through Yelp, which worked great.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a surly hostess and we informed her that our reservation was at 6:30 (time was 6:24).  She said \"we will seat you right at 6\".  There was no one in the place and no one waiting!  We stood awkwardly in the lobby for 6 minutes and she took us to our lakeside table.  Great setting!  The waiter took our drink order while we waited for our friends.  Four times in about ten minutes, random waiters showed up with drinks for other people.  Do they have any kind of system?  We ordered pretzels and cheese.  \"Cheese\" is over-microwaved cheese whiz with stale pretzels.  We had to ask for plates, napkins and silverware and waited ten minutes to receive.  The drinks were all tasty.  We ordered fish and chips, a burger and ribs.  The burger was good, ribs so-so and fish and chips arrived stone cold after 45 minute wait.  The waiter took back the fish and chips, where I am certain they re-fried the same pieces and brought them back hot, but overcooked and chewy. Fries were soggy.  Our friends were nearly done eating when we got our food.   Waiter offers free desert vs. any kind of comp on the meal--very lame.  The restaurant was half empty for most of the night, but the bar was very lively.  This appears to be a 30-something neighborhood scene and probably great if all you want is a cocktail.  I sadly cannot recommend for a meal.",

Would love to sit out on their patio later in the night when it's a little cooler. Our server was Cass and she was so knowledgeable and sweet. She was able to provide great suggestions for both food and drinks. We discovered it was happy hour and all of their specialty cocktails are only $5 along with drafts, wines by the glass, and a bunch of food options. Definitely one of the better happy hours I've seen. I tried the ginger margarita and it was great. The ginger made it a little extra refreshing. My boyfriend had the new old fashioned and enjoyed it as well. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip on happy hour, I ordered the Mediterranean wrap, and my boyfriend had a burger. Everything was as delicious as Cass had promised. So glad we got the coupon and had the chance to check this place out!",

    "text": "Not real impressed.   We decided on a date night and made the mistake of sitting at the bar thinking we would actually get halfway decent service...   Bartender / Barbacks are slack. Dirty glassware left in front of us after we had to request to order a couple of cocktails. Asked twice for a couple of dinner menus - given only one drink menu. Then we asked for a couple of waters. How do they manage to run out of the cucumber mix for one of their signature cocktails (the Lighthouse) in the middle a holiday weekend?  The Huevos Rancheros - since when does that dish mean a plate full of french fires (\"dusted potatoes\" as the menu says) covered in green chile sauce and a couple of eggs?  My spouse requested to see the manager - Mark.  There were no beans in the dish - even though according to him there were a \"few in there\". So, after a request for  additional beans then did the dish seem actually like something other than green chili covered plate-o-fires.  The Monte Cristo would have been a better tasting sandwich if it was more than \"Texas Sized\" bread with hardly any meat inside the actual sandwich.  For the price of the dish - try putting some actual meat inside it.    It would also be a good idea if the bartender had a clue about the food items actually listed on the menu.  Ours did not.    We had visited this establishment earlier in the week - Kelsea was a wonderful server.  So, that is why we are not listing our experiences at only one star.  Kelsea was courteous and attentive to us.  Sadly, the crab cakes were more \"filler\" than crab meat.  Perhaps I am spoiled from the Maryland Crab Cakes I am accustomed to from the east coast - but again, more corn meal than crab.   Sadly, while this location has a great amount of appeal and we do wish to give our business to locally owned and operated entrepreneurs, we would have been better off and had a better dining experience at an Outback or Red Lobster.",

    "text": "Today was my first time going to this restaurant and the only positive thing I can say is the patio area had a nice view. The most upsetting part is this is where we chose to eat on Easter, the kids were excited about a boat ride that we called in advance to make sure would be operating on Easter and were assured they would be.Yet, once there, we were told no rides were being offered because the manager wasn't there due to a sick child at home. Are you kidding me? A holiday and no other management? The food was at best decent and I found them to be pricey. A family of 4 was $82 not including tip for breakfast and drinks. Also I asked for a cup of coffee, waited ten minutes and was brought out a dirty cup that was less than half filled. My husband ordered a burrito and asked to sub out the bacon for tri tip. Well he gets his burrito and they put in bacon. By the time they remade it the rest of us were done eating our meals. To make it worse he asked for green sauce and they put red sauce, then they must have caught the mistake and poured green sauce over it instead of fixing their second mistake. I asked for an extra side of salsa for my meal and instead was given none at all. Had to wait once I asked the server and was almost done with my omelette before getting it. No offers or discounts were given for our terrible visit and of course no management to speak to about all the complications. Unfortunately IHop would have been a much better dining option. Beyond disappointing.",

I was afraid it would be cold for as long as it took to get it. They were not that busy for the wait we had with server to get us the bill. We were actually ready to get up an go find him. I guess we were anticipating more since they have been open for awhile to get kinks out. Looks like construction is still going on. I will be hesitant to return.",

I was in a group of 6 people, and we were seated outside. it was pretty, but I wish they had misters and a big umbrella bc the sun was either right in your eyes or on the back of your neck. our waiter was helpful and nice, and made a point of checking up on us every 15-20 minutes and refilling drinks. however, the food took forever (about 35 minutes) and we were there on a Sunday evening. the food was okay. I had the portobello sandwich which was quite small and it came out cold. my boyfriend had the fish tacos and they were also cold. we would have gone on one of the boat rides that they offer, however the battery was dead by the time we were ready to go, which I figured would have been the redeeming quality of the evening. they gave us about 10 free boat tickets. I would suggest going during happy hour to watch a game and load up on appetizers (which were all very good!) then do a boat ride around the lakes. not sure if I would visit again if we didn't have the boat tickets.",

My first visit here was for a wedding on the patio. There was something so beautiful and magical about the bride and groom arriving to the ceremony by boat, and watching the sunset over the water certainly added to the experience. The food was buffet style Mexican - and quite tasty. I went back for a happy hour with my sister. The margaritas and sangrias were a great compliment to a warm spring day. The weather on the patio was perfect - and having a cocktail while watching another sunset on the water was just as peaceful, beautiful and enchanting as it had been for the wedding. We didn't have much by way of food. A couple of orders of wings, fries, and guacamole. I think they were all good. Honestly, they may have been mediocre, but with fantastic company and this setting, they would have tasted great no matter what. The staff is friendly and laid back, and I am thrilled to have a waterfront happy hour just minutes from my office. Perfect mini-vacation. This will definitely be on my regular rotation!",

At this point, a small area inside the building and the patio overlooking the lake are the only areas that are open. Eventually they will have seating for probably double what they have now.  The service was full of ambition but utterly lacking in execution. They use a phone app to communicate orders between the servers and the kitchen (which is also where drinks are produced from). The problem is they are apparently unreliable. We had a good sized group of maybe a dozen and several people's orders never came out after waiting a good 1/2 hour at which point we were able to get someone to acknowledge it and they sincerely apologized and were willing to comp some stuff but it needs to not happen like that.  Having people wait for 45 minutes to get a drink (and theres no bar, so you dont have an option to get it yourself) is unacceptable. I really want to see you succeed but whether its understaffing or undertraining, the service issues certainly need to be corrected before you kill your own reputation.",

They gave us private access to the Captain's room (pool table, couches, flat screens) as well as the area outside with dart boards.

Upon entry, the interior looked rather plain, particularly for the exterior and setting.  We were seated on the water-front patio, and based on this, my immediate impression was that this could be our next favorite place!  The wait staff was pleasant, but the food was sub-par.  We had the pretzel bites as an appetizer - they were hard, and the cheese had a skin on it.  The fish dishes that we received were bland, and my \"garlic\" mashed potatoes (more on this in a moment) and vegetables were not evenly heated (cool spots).  My wife's entree had a side of garlic cilantro rice, and it was just rice - perhaps they were out of garlic, because my garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic ether.  The plating was also lacking (you expect more by the prices) - oh, and our entrees arrived before our silverware did.  We passed on dessert because they only had two options, and we figured both would be as bland as the entrees.  Overall this establishment is not at all living up to its potential, and it has great potential.  One last thing:  there is an office to the right of the entry lobby that is haphazardly filled with miscellaneous supplies, and the door was wide open...hardly a view any guests should see when they first walk in.  The owners must just not care.  Too bad.",

The problem with everything else! After looking at all the pictures on Yelp I was prepared to either try the nachos or the crab cakes because both look delectable. Unfortunately upon arrival we learned that they no longer serve the nachos and they have a seasonal menu, in fact, they will have four different menu's throughout the year for each season. No bueno! There was nothing on the menu that seems appealing, I ended up getting the grilled mahi mahi sandwich which was bland, very tasteless, and the herb potatoes were mediocre! So then I decided to try the jambalaya, big mistake, even worse the rice was mushy and again very bland. The watershed would be an amazing place to celebrate birthdays, holidays, or just hang out with friends, your husband/wife, or boyfriend/girlfriend,  it definitely has a great outdoor atmosphere but unfortunately you leave hungry, very hungry. In fact we had to leave and visit another restaurant just to actually eat a meal for the evening. I was so looking forward to visiting the watershed but it was very underwhelming!",

We made reservations on a Sunday evening at 5:30 for the \"lawn seating\" The view was spectacular! We brought friends from out of state, so we were so impressed with the ambiance. We were seated and immediately told by our waiter that the kitchen was \"behind\". He said about 20-30 minutes. NO problem we thought since the view was so amazing. HOWEVER, the waiter took forever to bring the drinks and when he did he didn't bring water for my daughter (her only beverage) for another 5 minutes or so.. We ordered 3 different appitizers. Pretzel bites Coconut Shrimp and Nachos. We waited 30 minutes just for the pretzel bites... then they attempted to bring ONE of our entree orders (fish tacos) before the other two appetizers. We wated another 30 minutes and saw nachos. We had no forks and no appetizer plates at this point. (not a kitchen running behind, just awful waiter service) No refills on water. After waiting another 20 minutes or so we finally gave up and went to the front (as our waiter was nowhere to be seen) to pay for our cocktails. We were a party of 6 adults. 5 of us had cocktails. We ordered 3 appetizers and 6 entrees. This restaurant has an obvious absent owner(s) We left paying nothing and was told by the front staff that they understood and didn't blame us for leaving. It has to be so frustrating for the staff that works there as well? The worse part is... the potential is amazing for this place.. but the service and way the restaurant is run will keep us from going back until i read some better reviews. Good luck!",

I entered through the patio and didn't see all the construction taking place indoors until I was leaving.  Maybe they should have finished the construction projects before they opened?  However, the construction was not the problem on this night.  The server was very friendly, and I truly felt sorry for him, because clearly the disorganization was not his fault.  The meal for our party of 8 came in four separate shifts.  The lag from the first two meals being delivered to the last one being delivered was nearly 10 minutes.   Mind you... it was after dark and chilly outside.  This left the first two diners with the choice of eating while others didn't yet have their meals, or waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and then eating cold food.  Unacceptable, and inexcusable-- not that there was anybody there who seemed to be aware enough to even offer an excuse.    Where was the help for this waiter???   A party of 8 is not a party of 20, and should be easily manageable-- especially since it wasn't busy.  Not a manager/assistant/owner/busboy/cook/runner in sight to help carry food.   I didn't see a single table inside, and it appeared that the majority of the half dozen tables sitting outside were mostly just drinking.  To the owner/manager--- please know that you are building your reputation NOW, soft opening or not.  If you don't have adequate service when the restaurant is nearly empty, what will you do on a genuinely busy night?  I will give this restaurant another chance (others would say NO WAY!), because the view is nice and the poor waiter seemed to have been set up for failure by the management and/or owner.",

    "text": "I'm shocked at the other reviews that give higher marks... this place is a must skip! I agree, the atmosphere is nice being outside on the water and I'm a big fan of Pier 54 next door... however, it takes a lot more than just the outside atmosphere to make me want to go back to a place. The layout of the place is just awkward- we walked through the front door into a big open space that looks like a banquet hall and then one random table inside near the fireplace. Outside there is one section of picnic tables that don't fit in with the style and then around the other side of the building are seating areas and tables and chairs. We sat at a table to order dinner- however the tables were very awkward to sit at- the bars of the legs and supports got in the way of where your feet go, plus the chairs were really rigid and uncomfortable. Service is meh... some servers looked like they wanted to be there and work, ours did not.... we ordered drinks and queso fundido which took 25 minutes to come out and was only so so- the chorizo was a nice touch but the cheese hardened soon after it arrived to our table and we needed to scrap it with a fork to get some for the chips. For dinner, I ordered the green chilies enchiladas and my boyfriend ordered the burger. Our food took an hour to come out (expected if the place was totally busy and slammed with people... not the case here). While waiting we had the great entertainment of the drunks sitting in one of the couch areas next to our table. The ladies were over served and stumbling and screaming while looking for one of their phones making the atmosphere hard to enjoy. Luckily they left half way through our our wait for the food but made the couch area a disaster while looking for the phone- funniest part of that is not one staff member fixed the area! The cushions were everywhere and pillows on the ground- no one cared to take the minute to clean it up for others to sit at. When our food finally arrived, the music had been turned up and we could barely hold a conversation. The burger my boyfriend got had a bun that was bigger than necessary and he needed to cut away over half of it to fit it in his mouth- an additional bonus for him to find out was that the burger was burned. My enchiladas were so incredibly spicy that I couldn't eat them. I used the excess parts of the burger's bun to try and take the burn out of my mouth. I ate about two bites and was done. The server never checked on us to see how things were until our drinks were empty and we had been sitting there for 15 minutes without touching our food... when I told her that the enchiladas were extremely spicy, she took my side plate and placed it over the dinner plate, picked it up and said \"ok\" and walked away to get the bill. Didn't ask if I wanted something else, take it home, or take it off the bill- I clearly had hardly touched the food... Over priced food and drinks for crappy food and service. Save your money and mouth by skipping this place- go next door to Pier 54!!",

    "text": "This was our first (and last) visit.  We chose it for the patio views, which were beautiful. We arrived promptly for a 6pm reservation and by 6:20 were begging to have someone take our order.  The food finally arrived at 7pm, a full hour after we were seated, and even then the tri-tip sandwich was missing the au jus and the salad looked like it had been thrown together hastily. If the food had actually been high quality much would have been forgiven, but it was only mediocre - I've had much better food at Paradise Bakery.  When we asked to speak to the manager, he was defensive and said they had three birthday parties that they hadn't planned on.  Maybe they should require reservations for large parties rather than letting them drop in unannounced and ruin it for everyone else?  He offered us a free appetizer and glass of wine, which seemed strange after we had finished dinner.  When we suggested an adjustment to the bill might be more appropriate he walked away shaking his head like we were being unreasonable.  He finally came back and did adjust the bill grudgingly. Between incredibly slow service, mediocre food and a bad attitude that's three strikes and they're out.",

    "text": "A friend told me about his place because of the pretty view.  I will give it that as you are right on the lake but that's all that was good.  We have friends from out of state and wanted to give them a nice AZ experience on the waters edge.  My fiancee and I got there first as we wanted to try the happy hour menu.  The sangrias and frozen drinks were highlighted on the happy hour menu.  I ordered sangria, the waiter came about 10 minutes later and said they were out.  How can they be out, its 5pm on a Friday?  So then I asked for a frozen drink, guess what.....out of that also.  Being frustrated at this place, I asked him to tell me what else they didn't have and he assured me that everything else they had. The waiter could tell we were upset that the two main drink specials, they didn't have.  He said he felt bad and would bring us some chips and salsa.  He walked around for another 15 minutes or so and didn't bring anything during that timeframe.  Then our friends from MN show up and we warn them that the waiter is new and they don't have the drinks that we wanted.  Sure enough, my friend ordered a beer that they said they had (MGL) AND guess what, they are out!  So we read about the pretzel rolls being good so we order those and calamari for starters.  NO exaggeration, it was over 1 hour and they still hadn't brought them.  We asked several times, the waiter said he kept asking the cooks but still a no show.  We asked to talk to the manager.  The waiter said he already asked the manager several time to come to our table, he NEVER showed.  So then we ask for chicken wings... Guess what, they are out.  We were so hungry by then we just told them to cancel our starters as it had been over an hour.  We did order dinner which was fair and did come in a fairly timely manner.  I could see maybe if they were busy, but on a Friday night, only about 1/4 full and we think we learned why.  The waiter said he asked the manager at least 5 times to come to our table as he also thought what we went through was unacceptable.  We ended up being there for about 2 1/2 hours and only ended up with some drinks and the supper but no starters that we waited an hour for that never showed.  Please, do NOT take your out of town guest here and we also will NEVER go back.  I have no idea how they stay in business!  Beautiful location ruined by a terrible experience......",

Unfortunately, I was helping to plan a Celebration of Life for a dear friend with terminal brain cancer and the staff was aware I could be calling them at any time to set a date.  Tuesday morning, my friend passed away and I knew that we would need the inside as well as the outside. I have never seen a more dedicated group of people jump in to work night and day so the inside was as close to perfect as they could get it. I spent the last several days at The Watershed, setting up special items and placing candles and flowers. I had every person that I encountered go above and beyond to help me. The celebration occurred on Friday and things could not have been more perfect. The food, atmosphere, drinks, staff, and facility were just exactly what my friend would have wanted. I will be taking everyone I know to this restaurant. If I need to plan another event, I will be calling them. I hope the community gets behind this place and supports it as they perfect their service, food, and business.",

The staff is either very green or poorly trained. Drinks (water) shouldn't take 20 minutes to receive. A table of 3 shouldn't be plated with 5-10 minute increments between. I have gone twice because I like to give every place a second chance but I will not return until management trains and staffs up the place.

I feel like if more people saw the newly renovated place they would like it!  The problem here is tjat the restaurant is still open later and seems like the atmosphere is too quiet to support that bar being super active.  Still, i like it and its pretty :)",

Received my first beer and half the glass was head.  I then asked for a menu which took another 10 minutes to find. I tried the fish and chips, holy shit you'd be better off buying Gordon's frozen fish sticks! Came with slaw which was buried under the fish and at a very warm temp. Proceeded to finish my beer and food as I watched the 3 bartenders scramble around washing dishes and not taking orders. No smiles, not even any small talk. Finished off my beer and sat it at the front of the bar, it went easily unnoticed for another 10-15 min.watched several folks approach the bar to order and walk away after waiting for lengthy amounts of time without being noticed. The bar tenders were upset and making excuses amongst each other. Before I go on, what happened to the live music? It stopped abruptly at 7 pm? That's when the bar was full and ready to order more drinks and dance. I witnessed one bartender cut her hand open while washing glasses and still proceed to serve/ make drinks!!! I'm disgusted and wouldn't even consider stepping foot into this establishment ever again. Super sad when this place has so much potential! #barrescue!",

    "text": "I recently found out about The Watershed in conjunction with their Wednesday open mic nights, so I decided to go.   The staff is friendly. The bartender, Alex, is personable, professional, and and very knowledgeable regarding mixed drinks and alcoholic beverages in general.   Michael Loney, the bar manager; however, is the reason this changed from a 5-star to a 1-star review. As the individual in charge of the open mic contest, Mr. Loney has displayed a lack of transparency, a fiery temper, and perpetuated general confusion regarding the open mic contest. Two weeks into the contest he pulled Alex Hristov aside and told him he would be \"perfect for Sunday brunch\" and to contact him regarding that. After the winner was announced on July 1st (Alex Hristov), Mr. Loney provided no details whatsoever regarding the nature of the \"regular paid gig\" that Alex won. After multiple attempts, via text, to clarify the specifics of the paid gig Alex won, Mr. Loney responded with exceptionally disrespectful texts, telling Alex he has \"no idea what you're talking about,\" when Alex texted him a screenshot of The Watershed's Instagram post, stating Alex as being the winner of the July contest. He told Alex that the gig he had won was the Sunday brunch gig in August.   So, according to Mr. Loney, Alex won the contest just two weeks into the month. This means he had people competing for another two weeks for no reason. Think about that. What Mr. Loney is doing is providing free live music, under the guise of an open mic contest, without paying these musicians, and without giving them any details whatsoever about the nature of the contest, or details for the \"winner.\" Alex has yet to receive any information regarding what it means to have won this \"open mic contest,\" and in fact, has received multiple disrespectful and unprofessional correspondences from Mr. Loney, who continues to ignore and belittle Alex, via text message.   To be fair, because I am, the venue is amazingly beautiful. I would recommend going out back to see the beautiful lake, the island in the middle of it, and the amazing views--especially at sunset.  There are reasons this establishment has a SOLID 3 stars. If you read all 317 reviews you'll notice the same complaints: bad service, inconsistent food quality, poor food quality, and generally being understaffed. You'll also notice that the positive reviews mention all the positive things I already mentioned.  Amazing venue. Much potential. Underutilized assets. And unfortunately, poor management. Observing Alex (the bartender, not the July open mic contest champion), I would say he is much more qualified to be bar manager. He's young, personable, likable, social, good at his job, good at multitasking (partly due to the understaffing problem), and in my estimation, a superior candidate to manage The Watershed's bar, and hopefully, be the reason people post more 5-star reviews.",

    "text": "A beautiful late  Sunday morning, an awesome setting  (on the water) and a neat looking restaurant. I have mixed feelings about this place. We were immediately and exuberantly greeted by a pleasant male host who was obviously a \"morning person.\" Our table had a lovely view of the lake. In less than 10 minutes our waiter appeared, took our orders and returned with our sangria. The calamari appetizer was excellent. Lightly battered non-greasy calamari, perfectly fried and accompanied by a marinara sauce. My husband ordered fish and chips and got two large perfectly fried portions of cod, fries, and really yummy coleslaw. The chef must have liked him better. I got the buttermilk battered chicken sandwich. Hubby thought I ordered something Cajun. Nestled on a wonderful looking roll with fresh veggies and fries Ithe chicken breast was dark brown, very crunchy and attempting to saw through it with my knife was difficult. Our waiter, Brandon, quickly reordered it for me. While waiting, I filled up on some of the best fries ever and sampled from my husband's plate. By the time the replacement sandwich arrived (cooked better) I was pretty full so ended up taking most of it home. Whoever cooked that chicken breast clearly should have seen that it was overcooked, but probably hoped I wouldn't notice it tucked into the bun. With everything else so good, this had a major impact on our experience.Service was good, and the restrooms were clean, but I'm not sure I would travel the 30 minutes to return. However, if in the area might give it another shot.",

The food is below average, everything seemed to be out of a can, I could have made better nachos myself at home, heck Taco Bell has better nachos.

From start to finish this was an EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE! Tyler & Jake were our dedicated waiters for the night which didn't skip a beat! Steve the Manager insured me that all would be taken care of and even drove our guests around the lake in the pontoon boat! Spent the entire evening in a private room called the Captain's Lounge which had a fireplace, 2 TV's, pool table, and even a sound system that we connected with our cell phone to keep the guests entertained with our favorite music.   Outside there was plenty of seating on the deck along with darts, cornhole and portable heaters to make everyone feel comfortable. Come around 5pm and wait for an awesome sunset.  The only opportunity we experienced were the bathrooms, several ladies complained that the bathrooms needed attention.   Overall a great experience and we will defiantly be coming back to enjoy this hidden oasis in the desert.",

My bosses reserved the Captain's Room. Ok, if you ever have a group of 10 or more, reserve this room! It's great! It's your own private room, with a dining room table, lounge area, two tvs, fireplace, and pool table. The best part about this restaurant is that it is right on the lake so you have a beautiful view while you eat here. The outdoor patio is also very nice. They laid down some grass and have some tables out there as well as corn hole, and darts for you to play.   Food & drinks.. They have happy hour from 3-6 I believe. We ended up ordering the nachos, coconut shrimp, green chile cheese fries. My favorite was probably the cheese fries. There's a kick to it but it's really good. For drinks, my bosses spoil us. We ordered 4 bottles of wine! I'm a red wine drinker and my favorite is Pinot Noir. It was really good as well as the Cabernet that they had.   This place is really new so I don't think many people know about it. I think the inside needs some more interior designing and they need a huge sign outside that says The Watershed on it. Also, I would recommend extending the happy hour menu to 7 instead. The service was amazing as well. I need to start taking down servers' names when I go out because I never remember and ours was great! He was extremely friendly and very helpful with our group. I'll definitely be back soon! =)",

I was told it was going to be a 30 minute wait for a table.  So I informed the Hostess that I would wait.  Well while in the process of waiting. A white group walked up and requested the exact same thing as I did.  They were asked for there name and phone number so that they could be called when a table was going to be ready.  I was never asked for my name and phone number.  So if I had not questioned the Hostess about this I would have never gotten a table on the patio.   After finally being escorted to the Patio area.  I noticed at least three other vacant tables.  So there was never a need to put me on a list for available tables when there were tables already available.",

    "text": "WOW Where do we begin?! ANY 5 star review on here is PAID for or a friend of the owners! I would give this 0 Stars if I could.  Lets start from the beginning... We got seated on the patio at a dirty table that the bus boy had to come over and wipe down a few minutes after sitting down. THEN we wait... and wait... and wait some more. 15 minutes go by and we have not even been greeted! On top of that another party that was seated 10 minutes after us got greeted before us and got their order in!!  Finally a waitress comes by and says she will send someone to be right with us. Then we waited again, and the initial waitress ends up coming back to take our drink order. So 20 minutes in and already off to a rough start. We ordered drinks and food all at once because we figured we would not see our waitress again.  As we sit and wait on the patio near the lake we get bombed with a million nats flying around the water. Gross. Then our meal comes, the coconut shrimp and the Albuquerque turkey. The 5 tiny coconut shrimp was tasteless and you could only taste the breading (not worth the $12 tag). The turkey sandwich was sub-par. As we eat, we order another sangria which never came after waiting over 10 minutes. By then we had finished our meal and did not want the sangria so we told the waiter to just take it off our bill and close us out.  During our dinner we experienced the sight of other patrons waiting as well for their servers and obviously getting very frustrated. One lady even demanded a manager which came and offered free food I believe. Another elderly couple looked upset as their drinks were empty throughout and waiting forever for their check to leave.   As we left I wanted to briefly speak to the manager to simply express my concerns and experience in hopes it could miraculously make this place better. I initially asked one of the servers near the front host desk to grab the manager for me please. She said ok, and then I began to wait. After waiting a good 5 minutes I asked the host to please grab the manager for me. She continues to walk into the kitchen to tell the manager... and the next thing I hear is a loud 4 letter F bomb! ****! Then the hostess comes out of the kitchen and tells me \"THE MANAGER IS REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW AND CANT SPEAK TO YOU\". HAHAHA! Never in my life have I been denied to speak to a manager in any establishment. What a joke this place is!  Come to find out the managers name is Matt and I guess he is part owner. What a shame this place is going to crash before it can even get built up.  Recommendation: STAY FAR AWAY from this place! There are much better places to go to with better food and WAY better service.  And to the owners, Matt and \"Dan Scott\" DO NOT contact me or offer me to adjust my review or offer free food. PLEASE DO US A FAVOR and get OUT of the RESTAURANT business ASAP.  And why do you continue to call it a \"soft opening\" when you've been open for over 3 months! Get outa here! And Dan quit replying to everyones bad reviews and talking about your personal life and your sorry newspaper in NM. No one gives a rats. You seem so selfish and disgusting you make me want to throw up, and I don't even know you.  Oh and also, read this link for a \"professional\" review if you don't believe my critique.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.phoenixnewtimes.com%2Fbella%2F2014%2F02%2Fwatershed_tempe_happy_hour.php%3Fpage%3D2&s=76812d9040de71db5afd38fefcde4235d669bf694a74ce6fe9aea29f254aaf11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs.phoenixnewtimes.co...</a>",

They restaurant is big, decor nice, lots of TV's if you are a sports fan, GREAT live band, and right on the water which was beautiful.  The service was also really good. Our waiter, Mike, was super friendly, he checked on is frequently and our food and drinks came out quickly.  Now the negatives: the food. The menu has a good selection, I would have preferred a couple of healthier options, but that is just my preference. Everything that we ordered just didn't seem fresh, it was bad bar food.  The crab cakes were pretty dense and not super hot, like they were premade and then reheated. Same goes for the kids quesadilla. I didn't think we could go wrong ordering that for our 2 year old, but once again, it seemed reheated. The cheese seemed old and not hot or gooey like it should be. The fries that came with were hot to touch but not cooked all the way. My husband had the ribs and those were actually quite good. The meatloaf was decent but I was hoping for better. And I think the mashed potatoes were the worst, just bad diner style.  I will still go back, but now with the mindset of listening to great music or watching the game at the bar!",

However, we wanted a nice place that would allow us to mingle. We were just about to sign with a well known Scottsdale Hotel when a committee member stopped in and talked to the owner, Dan. We ended up sharing half of the restaurant inside & outside with another reunion. So, the whole place was closed due to two private parties. We had about 150 people. We had a dance floor, DJ, the bar, two buffet lines, an area for registration. The food was phenomenal, the bar kept up with us (we spent about $3,000 in liquor), the restaurant made sure water, ice tea and lemonade was available, we decorated to add to the festive atmosphere. When I tell you that this was our 4th reunion (3 held in Scottsdale) and everyone told us it was the absolute best reunion ever . . . I am happy to take the accolades. However, Sharmayne was available for whatever whim we had. We were not the easiest people to please and she never said \"no\" to us. We had a pre-meeting and a tasting with Sharmayne. Sharmayne had a surprise event visitor and her co-event coordinator stepped right in to help us complete the planning. It was gorgeous with the lake as a backdrop, parking was no problem with the second lot, and I would be a happy reference for Dan and Sharmayne.  Thank you for making my event the best!  I am proud to give you my best of recommendations!",

Received water after 40 minutes (we were playing a game to see how long it would take). Came back to take our order but we were 10 minutes from leaving. We sat at this establishment for 1 hour 50 minutes and only once did our waiter look our way when we got up to leave. We gave up trying after the first hour. It's not worth my time to flag someone down to beg them to take my money. Crazy. Realize they were busy but my wife and I just gave up and promised to spread the word about this place.  Our other friends decided to stay and they did order. It took them an additional 70 minutes to receive their order. What kind of place is this?  I truly hope the owner will reach out to us. We left our party with two glasses of empty water $and no food and no bar tab. We went down the street and spent out $91 elsewhere and $31 for bar tab. I guess my $120 just wasn't good enough that night for attention. Sad part is we saw the website ahead of time and were tempted to book a large party of our own coming up shortly which I imagine would've brought in at least $800$900 in revenue with our group of 22.  Nice job guys.Thanks for a great experience on our one night out in the last 4 months.   Owner's thoughts?",

Enjoy!    __________________________________________________________    Hey Brett,  Dan Scott, the owner, here. Thanks for taking time out of your late Saturday night to review my soft opening. I reviewed your ticket and you paid for two glasses of wine for two people. We also comped your meal. And, as someone who has been in this business and the media business for 20 yrs, it's very unprofessional to review someone else's meal. Especially when we made that situation right and the client was in the end happy.  Do me a favor and forget we exist.   We make everything from scratch and are working our tails off to make this a fantastic restaurant/bar and I know we'll succeed.  By the way, my assistant manager talked to you because I was off the clock from my 16 hour day and just started to celebrate my good friends engagement that had just transpired at my restaurant. My newspaper, (Weekly Alibi) has been doing reviews of restaurants for 20+ years and we have a policy of going to a restaurant multiple times before giving our review.   I guess that's the difference in qualitative professionalism between real reviewers and the Bretts of the world.  __________________________________________________________  I think this speaks louder than words.",

Although I doubt I will be going back after my last visit. Went with a buddy and ordered a double of Jameson on the rocks. Was having a good time so I ordered another one. It wasn't until the check came that the bartender decided to explain to me that the doubles I was drinking were $18 dollars a piece. You know it's bad when the bartender feels the need to go over your tab before running your card. Thank god he did though because had he not, a scene definitely would have been made. He said it was because the old bartenders would give away liquor for free. I'm not sure how or why that makes my drinks more expensive, but I digress. Was offered a 10% discount which I took, but didn't make a dent in the fact that I was literally being charged the price of 2 BOTTLES of whiskey for 4 shots. This place is a joke.",

    "text": "We have been going The Watershed for years so it holds a special place in our hearts... you truly can't find a better atmosphere and view - such a great gathering place for friends.  My best friend battled cancer for nearly 15 years so when she went to hospice (at only 38 years old)- we planned her celebration of life together and she immediately wanted it to be at The Watershed because it held so many memories we all treasured.  I can't even begin to express how incredible the entire staff made our experience... obviously a very emotional process, but Sharmayne and the crew truly went above and beyond from our very first meeting. Sharmayne worked closely with us so we could create the vision our dear friend had for this very important event. Sharmayne was detailed, compassionate, and extremely accommodating to our every need - she truly went out of her way to make it all happen.  The day of the event... it couldn't have been more perfect. The entire staff - from the bartenders, the audio/visual help, the boat captain, the servers --- everything was exactly how we had envisioned it to be... and even better. There were a few hundred people there throughout the four hours we had reserved and so many people complimented the entire experience.... it was beautiful and the staff was extraordinary.  I highly recommend The Watershed for any event --- if they can pull off a Celebration of Life with ease, compassion, and attention to every detail for hundreds of guests --- they can handle anything! We are forever grateful for the wonderful celebration and cherished memories they all helped us create.   Lindsay",

Driving it felt like we had left Az and were in the mountains or at the beach.  the building is large, open and comfortable with a great view. The beer selection is pretty solid with a lot of choices (the O'dell's Red IPA is great).  We had shrimp, calamari and pretzel bite appetizers and all were good.  I had the grilled chees with ham, which I split with my son.  My wife had the Albaturkey sandwich with sweet potato fries and my daughter a curry pasta dish.  Everyone enjoyed the food and I saw people passing around salmon and other entrees.    Give the place a try, good food, and a great atmosphere.",

The head waiter came over and told us that we were omitting one seat per table by pushing the seats together. We recommended that he course how many ppl were sitting at the tables and re-evaluate. He was not able to sway us and left in a bit of a huff. Second issue-I ordered a marguerita .... It was served in a plastic glass! A full service bar on a Saturday afternoon and plastic glass .. I asked for and was provided a glass, but was disappointed in presentation . Had the crab cakes - good. served on a bed of lettuce with a nice sauce.

    "text": "My husband and I have been here 3 times - once when it first opened for dinner, once for appetizers and drinks with some friends, and this last time for brunch. We love the view and the space. And... That's pretty much it.  This review is based on our last visit. We had just finished helping a friend move, and my husband was hungry. In hindsight, I should have driven us over to Snooze, but he wanted to sit outside by the lake.   Once we were seated, a lady from another table walked over to a couple who were seated behind us. We could overhear the conversation and I almost wish I hadn't. Apparently the lady had been waiting for quite a bit of time and never received her food. The couple sent back their food because there was hair in the pancakes (gag!).  Despite this, we decided to stay. My husband ordered the Shed Head omelette. He said that it was dry and that the potatoes were too salty. I ordered the huevos rancheros. Once the entree came out, I realized that the server did not ask me how I wanted my eggs cooked or whether I wanted the red or green sauce. So I ended up with scrambled eggs (meh) and green sauce in my meal. It was a big dish - eggs, potatoes, green sauce, and lots of cheese.  Remember the salty potatoes? They were definitely in this dish, which rendered the meal inedible. It was just so salty!   The final straw was when we received our receipt. My meal was supposed to be $8.99, but the receipt said $13.99. We asked the waiter and he took it back to be adjusted. However, I wonder if they got away with taking $5 from people who just didn't notice.  This space is amazing and the view is unbeatable. For now, we will only visit this place for drinks. The food just isn't good and the service is bad. Hopefully when this place closes for good, we'll be able to get a fun place in South Tempe. OHSO, The Vig, The Yard - come save us!",

When I walked in they said all the tables in the shade were booked even though I made a reservation and when I walked outside there were at least five tables open in the shade. We waited 15 mins for a server to come greet us, then another fifteen mins for water, then twenty mins for a coffee. The server never apologized for being delayed, and the restaurant had barely people in there. We had to go remind them about our coffee and for our water, which is ridiculous. The food came and I ordered the gumbo, which is supposed to be hot but it was barely room temperature, and my wife ordered a breakfast burrito, and even though it said she had a choice between red and green sauce, they never asked her what she wanted and made the decision for her that she will have the green sauce. Her burrito was also cold and even the cheese wasn't melted. Overall the location is great but the service is beyond horrendous and the management needs to do better training. What they really need is to have Bar Rescue come in with Jon Taffer and just yell at them. Don't waste your time here.",

    "text": "Headed to this place after picking up a friend from the airport after she had a six hour flight.  We just wanted to chat and have something light to eat.  As we both live nearby and I had never been to this place, we agreed we'd give it a shot!  We were hoping to sit on the patio. We were at first seated at a table in the bar directly in front of the stage.  My friend asked when the band would come on and the hostess said, \"about 20 minutes.\"  Well, we wanted to just chat (and not have to yell) so we asked if we could sit on the patio.  There were many empty tables but she said they didn't have a server covering that section. That's ok, me and my friend both worked in the service industry back in the day.  Unfortunate but understandable.  Our other option was to sit at the counter side by side and so that's what we did.    I ordered the seared ahi alongside a salad and she got a burger.  When our food arrived, even just by my eye, I could tell it wasn't right.  I touched the tuna with my finger and I s**t you not, it was 10 degrees from frozen.  My friend recognized my body language but I didn't want to make our dinner a downer. She insisted on knowing why I wasn't digging in (we were both starving) and I said, \"Feel a piece of this tuna..I ain't afraid of your finger-germs.\"  She did and was like, \"OMG you have to send it back.\"  I really hate the buzz-kill of that scenario and said that I'd take it home and fix it some way.  I didn't eat a bite of it at the restaurant.  It seemed that this tuna had been seared hours before and refrigerated in a TRES-COLD refrigerator for minimally a couple of hours.  I rock at making seared tuna at home and order it all the time.  I know that it should be served immediately so that there is still some heat on the outside and the inside should be room temperature because the ideal way to cook it is to bring the fish to room temperature before the high-temp sear.  Her burger was kinda thin, came a little overcooked but she enjoyed it.  She especially liked the bun.  We agreed we would love to come back to enjoy cocktails on the deck but never for the food. Twas a shame because there was a nice monsoon lightening show going on in the distance.  Ah well..... just file this under the un-socioeconomically-challenged-people problems category.",

We reserved a table on the patio. We did not get a patio table. Instead, we were seated in the corner inside. We waited a very long time for someone to come to our table. A lovely gal named Marisa came to wait on us. She apologized we had to wait stating she had just arrived and wasn't scheduled to work and got called in.   There may have been two servers working in the entire restaurant. We then waited some more for our drinks. Then we waited for our appetizer. We should've taken a cue from our neighbors at the table behind us who just plain walked out after their food was delivered and not to their liking. We then were visited by the manager who looked like he had been on a bender all day; he was wearing a t-shirt and plaid shorts. His shirt was a Lululemon shirt and he read us the quote on the inside of the seam about living happy, pursuing dreams and enjoying a few beers along the way. Pretty sure he had taken his shirt's advice. This is our introduction to him! He then offered us a round of drinks on the house. We waited for those for another 15 minutes. Still waiting for our meals. When they came out, they were cold. Got our free drinks 3/4 of the way they our meals.   To make a long painful story short, it was the worst service ever. Marisa must have been the only poor soul who picked up the phone when her employer called her and asked her to come in. Dinner and drinks took 2 1/2 hours!",

The Pretzel Bites were not pretzels, and they were not bites.  I am not sure who created this monstrosity, but the \"bites\" were about muffin sized.  And no, not little petite muffins, but full sized your mother makes for Thanksgiving sized muffins.  And, I was even sure how to describe the texture, but again, muffin is about right.  Granted, the outside was a nice dark brown color, and had a touch of soft pretzel like texture, but that is where the resemblance to a pretzel ended.  The interior of the pretzel was about the consistency of a muffin.  Oh, and they were $10.  Yuk......  The chips and salsa appeared to have come out of a bag and a store bought bottle.  Enough said.    The do have a nice beer list. and the beer was nice and cold.  Would be a decent place for a happy hour, or late night beer.  But, stay away from the food.",

My family and I found this place right here on Yelp. We were looking for dining options near the lake as a remembrance to my Dad who passed away a year ago. Our server, Ray, was very accommodating. We had concerns about nut allergies which he confirmed with the chef. I love red wine and he suggested the Dark Velvet Merlot which was full and flavorful with hints of blackberries just how I like it.  The salmon club wrap was fresh and satisfying. And the Grasshopper Pie!...superb! I definitely will be back. My only suggestion would be to add dinner music and have someone on site for boat rentals.",

Got an awesome table with a huge window. Ordered a Diet Coke and the weighted pointed out it was Pepsi which I appreciated. When he came back I showed him the groupon and was hoping for some help on what to do. That's when things went south. Refill on drinks took 15 minutes. He did bring it as soon as the cold food arrived which I also appreciate. Food took for ever and came out cold. Pretty sure he left it up there while he ignored us. Another waitress brought it out. Never saw him again. Never checked in how the cold food was. We ended up only spending 24 dollars of the 30 which made the deal not so great. And can't really comment on the cold food cause I suspect if it came out fresh it might have been good. Certainly not a fan of how long it took to get cold food.",

We were there for a fundraiser event, so it was a bit crowded as expected, but the food was great, the drinks were cheap, and the view... couldn't beat it. To end the night, a peaceful pontoon boat ride (it's electric!) took us around the lake. They even provided blankets for us.  We love The Watershed and can't wait to head back there. We met the most amazing people there.  It feels like hanging out at a friends' house/backyard.... LOVE IT !!!!",

The waiter was exceptionally slow, it took 25 minutes to get a glass of wine and the appetizer came out with the food. The food was sub-par and lukewarm. I came into the restaurant from the patio on two different occasions to ask for items for our table. When the food runner delivered ketchup- I asked for more and she replied \"is that not enough for you?\" The lack of respect and service is beyond disappointing for a $35/per person restaurant.   It's no surprise this place has only 3 stars. The view is pretty but atrocious service is not worth any amount of ambiance.",

Locals boat around the lake and pull right up to the dock. We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and there was maybe, a dozen guests in the whole place. We were seated immediately next to the lake and it was so pretty and very much a neighborhood environment. We let 3 different people know at three different times that we wanted to go for a boat ride since it was our first time. Two hours later, we left, no boat ride. We just got tired of asking.  Pros, we were seated quickly our food came to us quickly So nice to just sit outside in the sunshine on a lake  Cons Our water was never refilled or a refill offered the food was not good: overcooked, boxed mac n cheese slider was bland, not even piece of lettuce or tomato. There was just no love in the food, or what a restaurant is, like filling up a water glass or topper on your coffee, a hostess that comes to your table and asks how everything is.   I could see us going to this place for a beer or glass of wine and watch the sunset, but that is about it. It's not a neighborhood cafe with a chef that loves his craft, the wait staff down the block at Denny's is 100xs more attentive to their guests and more professional. Eat elsewhere and come here for a drink and the game.",

The\" tacos\" we ordered for our one appetizer looked like ONE on the plate. The one taco was flat under the other.  One tortilla side was crispy and dry. The other was soggy and dough. How that even happens is beyond me. The meat was stringy. Our server never came back to see how the drinks and food were. When I told him our taco situation- he stated\" well, I have never eaten those\" took our plates and walked away.

Finally got to order food at 8:45, food got here by 9:30, finished by 10, waited for our server to give us the check for 30 minutes, and waited another 30 minutes for him to fix the multiple errors he made on our check. Watered down drinks and mediocre food. Zero personality and sincerity from the waiter. Asked to turn the fans above our table off multiple times to no avail. Will not be returning. Waaaaay too expensive to justify the service and the quality of the food.",

    "text": "I had come here several times with family or my husband. It was always quiet and clean with a great view, so I decided to have a small get together with friends and family for my birthday last week.  I only ended up having a list of approx 10 people, but calling and asking for a table, the gentleman that answered acted like it was next to impossible, whatever I figured they were booked but he squeezed me in for 5-6pm arrival. My one friend arrived first, and the host acted confused and our table wasn't ready. My friend was worried and stressed about it but I shrugged this off too.  Service was slow and I let this go too, but beers came too late and we were excited to see a new menu thinking things would turn delicious. We were wrong when my brother said the salsa tasted like fruit place. No one at the table liked it, and when we explained that only the 5 of us would be dining and apologized that they set up a bigger table, they acted like they could care less. Looking around I was annoyed realizing there were about 4 parties around the whole place.  The server didn't know anything about the new menu, food kept coming late like the drinks, and splitting the check was a problem. Now I have been a server and bartender for years so I like to think I'm more than understanding, but when my husband asked for a propane heater they acted like it was an impossible feat and they were out of gas. Literally no one knew anything about anything. If it was busy it would be one thing, but now I understand why it's ALWAYS dead. I won't be back. I normally shrug things off but my entire party was annoyed and felt awkward... so frustrating.",

    "text": "Lakeside seating and a pontoon cruise adds that special something to anything you'd order here. If I lived closer, I would be a regular for sure since I love the ambiance and would enjoy watching sunsets over the lake day after day.  However, I was lured to travel the distance because I had a great online deal that included 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and a cruise for 2. Started with one of the best drinks I've ever had: a Gingerita that is made with their house-made ginger beer and highlighted with some tangy lime in a salt-rimmed glass (although I was disappointed it wasn't in a usual Margarita glass since it would've made for better dramatic effect). My friend had a Golden Monkey beer that came in its namesake glass, but it was less than a usual pint that the other beers came in so that was disappointing. Unfortunately they don't serve dinner rolls or bread while waiting for the entrees and they really should, esp. since the portion sizes are not generous. I had the Canadian walleye which was an especially thin fillet (it did not need the muddy looking lemon caper sauce), a scoop of garlic mashed potatoes, and carrots--not as tender as they should've been--just cut them thinner to cook along with the yellow and green squash. The lobster ravioli meal was supposed to come with crab balls instead of meat balls, but they forgot to put them on the plate so we had to remind the server and they were brought later: 3 of them, very tiny teaspoon sized, more like fried croquettes with soft filling and crunchy coating,  though very delicious. The ravioli was tasty but more like a paste filling than bits of lobster large enough to remind you what it was.  One torn in half and none too fresh breadstick garnished (?) the plate (you should be able to at least be close to an Olive Garden breadstick). After the meal we went on the cruise and it was just over 15 mins. and was pleasant enough, but come on, 1/2 hr. should be the norm even if you have to wait for a full boat before going out. We picked the perfect time to get on the boat since it was just sunset turning to night, so the return to shore showed off the pretty light reflections on the water. A more attentive server would've added to the experience too, our drink server was more personable and seemed to enjoy a little chat and info sharing. I want this place to succeed, but they need to work on it some more, esp. if people aren't coming on a coupon, they need to get their money's worth....",

She then told us it was a thirty minute wait for a table. They had a ton of open tables. She said we could wait in the bar but there would be no one waiting on us. We finally got a table outside and waited 15 minutes for drinks and thirty minutes for our food. Waiter was Corey and was nice enough but was flustered and kept forgetting things. My husband ordered the sandwich with corned beef cabbage on it and it was awful. He took two bites but didn't get a chance to send it back because no one checked on us for quite awhile. Still charged us for it even though I told the waiter it wasn't good and had him take it away with only two bites out of if. They ended up taking it off the bill. Really ruined a nice afternoon. We won't be going back and it's too bad because the setting is nice and relaxing but food is ok and customer service is nonexistent.",

That was the best thing about the meal. We were seated outside and it was hot and windy so we asked to switch. Which seemed like the end of the world. I 10 minutes later a server came with water for the table. We got champagne and kids got their drinks. She returned 15 minutes later with drinks and got our order. Service was mediocre and food was decent. There's a promotion going on if you spend $35 you get $10 off for a 5 star yelp. Desperate for good feedback? Solution-write a 5 star yelp and edit it. Unethical-sure. But who wouldn't want $10 off $35. This place could be great since it's on the water and has decent food.",

The view was beyond perfect, the food is great, and the people are friendly and kind! Props to Ms. Sharmayne Maytes, the event coordinator at The Watershed, for working with us on our wedding day. She answered our queries, made suggestions that were very helpful for us and always there when we had questions or favors.  During the wedding, everything turned out the way I hoped for, Sharmayne helped me put up the designs and took care of the plating exactly how I wanted, the food was great, although it took a while for them to serve all of it, it was delicious nonetheless and most of all, it was affordable. The best part of this though, is the scenic view The Watershed offers. My husband and I had the chance to go to the island to have photographers and it couldn't be more perfect. The Lake as a backdrop was just breath taking.   We first went to The Watershed on  Valentine's Day, and when our initial plan for the wedding didn't work out, we immediately thought this is the perfect place to have the Civil Wedding, and we did not regret having our memorable day spent there.  Thank you to Ms. Sharmayne and The Watershed, we will definitely be back! :)",

My friend wanted to give her mother a unique gift for Mother's Day and chose a brunch and boat ride at The Watershed. As they both live in the West Valley, they drove nearly an hour to share what they anticipated to be a pleasant day. They were seated among 10 other patrons, ate cold food that was not refreshed at the buffet, paid $48 per meal, and were told that the boat (which was advertised as part of the deal, free of charge, no less) was \"not electrically charged.\"  After explaining their disappointment to the manager and asking to speak with the owner, the owner refused to address them and the manager was not friendly and as an afterthought, offered a free boat ride at their next visit. After the unpleasant time spent dining out, my friend and her mother waited an hour before they were able to pay their tab, having paid the full amount, not receiving friendly or timely customer service, warm food, or a boat ride. As they were leaving, my friend saw other people taking a boat ride on the boat that was \"not electrically charged.\" Needless to say, this business does not deserve my patronage and I will spend my time and dollars elsewhere; I encourage the same of others.",

Then after we'd finished the server didn't bring our check for about 20 minutes, so we finally had to hunt her down. It took forever to get out of there. Worse, the food is pretty expensive but isn't really that good. The view of the lake is gorgeous and this place is conveniently located, but it's not very well run.

It's a hidden gem that you really wouldnt expect to find in the area.   My favorite time to go is during their really good happy hour which I believe is 3:30-6:30pm M-F.  I get my usual vodka cocktail and its $3 (even for a tall).  The food is a little expensive for my budget so I generally don't eat there, however it looks fantastic.

Our server often forgot about us I actually had to have others call her for us, even having to get up and actually walk up to here to pay our bill then wait at front door for our receipt. Horrible. Our food had no taste missing flavor and smaller portions for the price. We go to lots of restaurants so definitely know quality. Maybe because this was their Valentine's menu I'm not sure restaurant was not packed so the service we received has no excuse. Maybe regular menu with lower prices might have been a better choice. On the upside at the end of the night we did take a boat ride I have to say that I did give an extra star because the captain of the boat helped our night he was very knowledgeable and kind.",

    "text": "I live in The Lakes and The Watershed is very convenient for me. I have come to The Watershed multiple times, at different hours to try the menu offered at that time, and every time it is nothing but a disappointment. Tonight my boyfriend and I bought two beers and the chips/salsa with beer cheese. First off, our server was very sweet and respectful, I had no problem with him! It's the quality of the food. The Watershed puts on a front that it is this finer dining restaurant with all its lights and tall ceilings, but the food speaks for itself. It's as bad as dive bar food and it has been every time I come here. I have had horrible flatbreads, breakfast burritos and now salsa and beer cheese. Our salsa is the type that is all watery with not flavor and the so called beer cheese tastes like ballpark cheese sauce. I want to like this place but it is not worth any money! :(",

    "text": "I was SO thrilled to try this place out last night, just for the simple fact that the venue was adjacent to a body of water and had white lights draped along their patio.  The location is really tucked into the suburbs of Tempe, so this isn't a place you'd randomly stumble upon driving by.  Live music at both the bar and the restaurant on Saturday night. My friends and I sat on the patio and we could hear both musicians playing over each other. Rather confusing...  Our server (Jacob) was soo nice and had a joking demeanor, but forgot if he had/hadn't placed our order! We tried jogging his memory with menu items and the joke I made, and he finally remembered he had. He also forgot my sugar for my iced tea. It was hard to get annoyed w/him because he was so friendly and apologetic.  I ordered the Mahi-Mahi sandwich and it was so dry that I took maybe 4 bites at most. The seasoning was great, but I just couldn't choke down the sandwich. Steak fries were tasty so I nibbled away at those.  All in all, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything so special that would drive me to revisit again. It has fantastic potential - I hope the owner(s) read Yelp reviews and use the feedback for positive change.",

Sorry Sean William Scott, I know you own this place, but your staff is terrible.  1.  I got insulted by staff because some popcorn spilled on the ground (umm you insisted we try the popcorn)  2.  I could literally hear your staff talking about the 7 pieces of popcorn on the ground, and how they'd have to clean it up.  The popcorn YOUR company recommended.  God forbid they have to use a broom and clean up 7 kernels or popcorn .  3.  Your food was bland, overpriced, and took literally 45 minutes to come out.  4.  One of your waitresses or bar maids or whatever literally said \"seriously how do you spill that much popcorn, are you f***ing kidding me?\".  Wow.  Just wow.    Please stop serving popcorn at your bar if you're going to hold that against customers.  DO NOT EAT OR DRINK HERE",

Anyway, we were not starving so appetizers were our choice.  We had chips/salsa/queso & bruschetta. First it was all flavorless, not a drop if spices or even salt. The bruschetta was prepared on bread halves, too large for an appetizer.  My hubby ordered Arnold Palmer tea and got unsweetened tea with straight lemon juice poured in.  So bad!!! It took forever to get our appetizers, they came out 10 min apart. It was not even that busy for a Thursday night.   So will not cone back!  The ONLY saving grace was our waiter Ray!! He rocked!",

Waited some more, but no one bothered to make their way to our end of the patio.

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place because my fiance and I love dining on the water, but we were pretty disappointed. I think it has potential but they're a little confused on their identity and definitely need to reconsider their pricing. Here are a few observations:  - Pricing is way too high. This isn't Scottsdale and it's not nice enough to get away with the high prices being located off of Baseline in Tempe. As soon as happy hour ended the bar cleared out and everyone went next door to Pier 54.  - The food is ok but the menu is kind of all over the place.   - The place turns into a \"nightclub\" after 8/9ish on the weekends. That was an immediate turn off for us (and we're in our early 30s). It was pretty cheesy.  - Gorgeous views, but the weird uplighting inside the bar reflected off the glass and skewed the view.  - Bathrooms are awful. Both my fiance and I commented on how you could tell they skipped rehabbing the bathrooms and how important that was in a new restaurant.   - There is a cool pool table room in the back and games on the patio but no one was in there. I think this goes back to pricing and a confused identity.   - Our waitress (I think her name was Bailey) was awesome! Very attentive and personable.  Worth checking out for the view alone, but without defining their identity and lowering their prices, I give the place 6 months to a year.",

The place was not that busy, we waited 10 mins for our server, then 10 more mins for us to get our water. The food was cold and we waited 30 mins for that. The pasta was not worth $16! I could have gotten better pasta from olive garden. The waitress never refilled  our waters, sitting outside in 80 degree Az weather, you get thirsty and your server should always be checking your at least hydrated. I also ordered an ice tea which i never got. Then i had to chase the busser to just get some water. When our server finally came by we asked for the check and before i could get my card out she took off.. now we have to wait to cash out. Waiting, waiting, finally cant wait no longer walked to the bartender and asked if someone could just cash us out. He said i need to get your server, i said look we have already waited long enough and he just leaves.. horrible service,  over priced food for just edible enough to eat",

    "text": "Let's just say that my Mother's Day was not a \"Happy\" one thanks to my experience at The Watershed.  We arrived at 12:30 PM and ordered water and mimosas - took 20 minutes to receive our mimosas.  While we were waiting we stood in the line at the buffet to only be disappointed by cold food that looked like it had been sitting out since they opened.  The enchiladas were burnt, the eggs and pancakes were cold, the veggie lasagna and pork tenderloin cold...need I go on?  We went back up several times and each time it was the same thing - nothing had been changed out.  We finally asked our server to speak to a manager along with several other families who were sitting near us that had the same experience.  It took another 20 minutes for the manager to appear.  She did not seem to care about our concerns. All she said was \"we just put new food out so go take a look and I will come right back to check on you.\"  By that time, we were not hungry anymore (shouldn't have to wait over an hour to have the food that I originally came for), but we went up to take a look - still only a few things had been changed out.  We went back to our seat and never saw the manager again who said I will come right back to check on you.  Instead our server came back with our check and we asked to speak to the manager again...we waited another 20 min for her.  At that point we asked if we could have one of our $48 meals taken off.  She said the owner would not allow that to happen instead she gave me a voucher to come back (why would I want to come back to a place where the customer service and food were below par).  After paying the bill, we asked about the boat ride which was offered as part of the Mother's Day experience and was told it was being charged and it might be awhile.  We decided to leave after 3 hours of dealing with awful customer service only to see the boat was actually in use.  I went back furious and asked why we were lied to about the boat.  We decided to give the boat ride one more shot (my 6 year old daughter was looking forward to it) only to then be told it had to be charged AGAIN!  Moral of the story...Make sure you can provide your customers with the experience that you advertise (boat rides and amazing (HOT food) especially for $48 pp!  The owner needs to make some changes if he is going to continue running a successful business !",

I have family that live in the lakes and this was my 1st time.  I was thinking it would be a nice place for my Mother's birthday dinner sadly the menu and the staff were seriously lacking.  Our waitress read everything off a phone which really turned me off, she looked at the phone more than the people at the table.  I tried to order a beer but both of my choices were no longer carried but still on the menu.  We had 2 orders of crab cakes which where a mistake, more bread crumbs than crab.  I thought it was funny they serve a 15.99 tri tip sandwich with kettle chips and charge $2 to upgrade to fries.....  Was thinking about the ribs but $27.99 for a rack.  I had a $16 Greek salad and the dressing was aweful the dressing was way too sweet (never had sweet greek dressing people) and the chicken was dry and overcooked.  Bathrooms were dirty and the staff was poorly dressed.  Sorry but extremely short jean shorts and cowboy boots were worn in poor taste by the staff.  Do yourself a favor and don't go there for anything other than happy hour for a drink.",

    "text": "We have been to this restaurant about 4 times.  It is a great location, right on the water. A novelty in the Phoenix area. The inside has a nice modern rustic feel.  Upon each visit the quality of service and food seems to be declining each visit.  I really enjoyed my Guiness \"French dip\" (they have a different name but this is basically what it is) on a previous visit.  They changed it and not for the better. It is now served on a very soft brioche bun not conducive to dipping and there was something else missing I just am not sure what that was.  I was really disappointed.  Neither the runner or our server had been there longer than a month to know that it had changed.  The service was very slow.  Our check had to be corrected twice due to incorrect charges. They did correct their errors but attention to detail would have avoided the situation.  On a positive note my husband did enjoy the green chili meatloaf.  I want to like this place but I don't know that I can give it another chance.",

Drinks took far too long to arrive given how few other patrons were actually there-when you've got a happy hour you need to make sure you can get drinks out.",

    "text": "I really like it here. The food was amazing and the view is great. The atmosphere is relaxed. My only complaint was the service.   I'll start with the food. I had the coconut shrimp that came with a sauce that had a spicy after taste to it. My bf had the monte cristo. Really good with a very sweet maple syrup that also had a spicy after bite. My absolute favorite was the lobster trap. It's a shot of vodka, an amazing tasting Lobster claw after shot, a session lager and last a piece of lobster.   Now to the service. Our server is Ryan d. She seemed to rush us out, got everyone else to come up to us so she didn't have to and didn't notice our empty drinks (doubt she cared). As I look around the patio, everyone else has a glass of water w a straw in it but us. We ordered 4 shots and a drink and she didn't offer us any water? I'm pretty heated. Were usually pretty good tippers. This is the first time we've left nothing.    We might be back just for those amazing lobster claw shots but definitely going to ask for a different server.",

Because of their efforts it turned out to be an even better celebration than we had planned. The appetizers, drinks and meals were exceptional and the customer service from management was more than professional. What a delightful visit, will be going back often.",

We had a huge group that ordered some of everything and the best comment on the food was, \"meh.\"  Go for drinks and great atmosphere and then go somewhere for dinner after.",
