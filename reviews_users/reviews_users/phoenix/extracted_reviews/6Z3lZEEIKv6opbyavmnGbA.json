I love the creativity of the place.  Crazy promotions like, Fish races on Thursdays, shirtless shots at 1, wearing sombreros for discounted tacos and other similar wacky ideas make the atmosphere fun.The prices are reasonable and they always have great specials.  They have a ton of burgers on the menu. My friends who have sampled them say they are very good.  I have had the wings a few times and I have to say they are better than average.  Recently I had the Spanking Monkey Sauce, Grilled.  A combo of the BBQ and Buffalo sauce combined.  Very Good.  I have also had the Tacos, Although they are very generous with the taco meat, filling the shell more than halfway to the top. The taco meat itself was only average.   Another thing that was unfortunate for me and I am sure it was an isolated incident, but recently when I was there the service was below average.  Not that she wasn't trying, but our waitress was apparently working alone and it took over an hour and a half  from start to finish to eat a quick meal.  We waited an inordinate amount for service, delivery of order and check to arrive.  Other than that, but place was terrific. Go check it out for yourself.",

The place was very dark, just as it should be.  The bartender was attentive (and since she wasn't that busy, it would have irritated me if she wasn't).  The beer was cold, the food was decent.  I had the fish and chips, and my buddy had the rueben.  Both were well done bar food.  Nothing special, but nothing to complain about either.  Goldilocks bar food--Just Right.  1 small pitcher of Bud light 1 pint Kilt Lifter 1 rueben 1 fish and chips  Bill was $24 + $6 tip = $30 total.  $15 each.  Not bad.  The place was clean enough that I'd eat there again.  It would have been nice if they were still serving breakfast at noon on a Sunday.  Why, because it is Sunday, and breakfasts can also be lunch.  It is called brunch.",

I've seen this on food network several times, but haven't found a place that offers this fantastic combination.  Leave it to a place called Monkey Pants.  Don't get me wrong, I had reservations about ordering this burger blissness.  Not only that, but I couldn't not order something so random and full of potential.    One of the best burgers I've ever had.  But seriously, Monkey Pants, I know you named the place just so it's hard to take you seriously... but mid afternoon on football Sunday and the bun was stale.  Not just on my burger, but on my gal's burger too.    Come on Man!  Oh wait, it wasn't Monday Night Football, but could have made the segment had Ditka experienced a burger cooked to order, and the ingredients so sinfully good.    My advice, order the burger, bring your own buns!",

The clientele appeared to be local regulars (always a good sign).  This is the only place I have ever been that offers 3 varieties of wings: fried, grilled or blackened.  I tried a hot grilled dozen.  The wings were very tasty but not hot by any means.  I'm not sure if my order was prepared wrong or if the grilling neutralizes the hotness a bit.  Either way the wings were very good so I have no real complaints.  It did take a bit for my wings to be served but the website did indicate that they employ only one cook and everything is made fresh.  I don't mind waiting for good eats.  The bar is large with ample seats at the bar and many tables.  If you're a sports fan they have television sets all over.  They don't all have the best picture but you won't miss any action.  There's a pool table, various arcade games and a jukebox (loaded with compact discs).    I dig Monkey Pants.  One day I shall return and inquire about the Burger Nation challenge.",

I used to go on Wednesdays because there was hilarious karaoke and free goldfish racing (where you name and race a goldfish against a random other person by squirting a bottle to try and push it down a lane to the finish line). My roommate actually won the goldfish tourney and we got 20 bucks off our tab. The food is mediocre but what is to be expected for those prices?! ...And of course the topless free shot at 1am is amazing. It isn't as bad as it sounds because everyone (guy/girl) takes off their shirt and there are so many people that no one is caring whether you're hot or a fat mess, it's all about having a good time (and it's not like you take off your bra).",

Normally that is said like a punch line...right?\" She giggled. \"They take cards-TOL is cash only. And its fucking cheap.\" Well. Cheap drinks get me every time. Sure, I 'll try Monkey (snicker) Pants.  As I pulled up, I kept looking around, maybe worried all the hipsters from TOL or Yucca would stand in shock and point down the strip mall \"Yo! You in the 'ironic' Genesis shirt and cat eye glasses-didn't you mean to get some shitty beer and download some Pixies on THIS side of the strip mall?!?\" And I would have to say...\"Yes. I wasn't gonna go to a fucking place called MONKEY PANTS-plfft- C'MON!\"  But...Confession 2: I love Monkey Pants. Dude, they take CARDS. Their happy hour is incredibly HAPPY. Buck fifty wells in a PINT glass, heavy handed? Cheap huge basket of fries? Reasonably priced beer ANYWAY? Trivia cards strewn about? Terrifying teddy bear wearing 80s workout clothes, taunting me to be a winner on their wall? More TVs than \"Videodrome\" or a bad 80s performance art piece (or Remote Control's Champion Room-yeah, MTV reference)? And just when you think you can't triple fist cheap G&Ts any longer...8pm rolls around and its SPECIALS time! Yippie!  Confession 3: I have been here more times than Time Out Lounge...during the day. TOL is for late at night. MP is for when you wanna get someone drunk you don't want your friends to know about and do them fast...and hit the hot hipsters for sloppy scenester seconds after midnight, ya know? Listen, I'm poor. And 15 bucks for being so trashed I had to call up a friend to help me to their house ONE BLOCK AWAY (twice) for over three hours of fun. Shit.  Yeah, the decor is kinda weird, a little Ground Roundish, I love the Legs Lamp, the bathroom is in the weirdest place ever, and you won't find your dream lover in front of the acoustic set they have. But Nate at the bar will take care of you (and your broken dreams), the regulars are ridiculous and your smoker friends can chill on the front patio and bring their drinks with 'em. Plus they have all this popcorn and you can throw at your friends near the shuffle board.  So Monkey Pants completes my Shitty Trifecta of Yucca, Time Out and Monkey-a Bermuda Triangle of Sleaze, if you will.",

I mean, who the hell frequents a bar named Monkey Pants? Do they have children in tow? Is there a petting zoo on the premises? Because it sounds like a Barney-Raffi-Teletubby-Wiggles sing-a-long title, not a place where adults go to get blotto.   Oh yeah? Well what's in a name? That which we call cheap fucking drinks by any other name would still get us loaded. And who are you to argue with Shakespeare? He hates your crappy emo poems anyway.  Huh. I guess I didn't know how strongly I felt about Monkey Pants until that verbal vomit just came spewing forth.  As a gesture of goodwill to those of you who I know I'll see at Time Out in the future, and will undoubtedly rib me for my irrational love of a place called Monkey Pants, I will concede the following point: it is most definitely not an evening drinking destination.   It is an excellent happy hour or weekend day drinking joint though. Discount 2.25 well and 1.75 domestic drafts between 5 and 7 (that only increase by a buck at regular prices)? Hell yes. An unlimited fount of free popcorn good for munching and launching? Check. An entire menu of good bar food if you're looking to absorb some of the alcohol sloshing around? You betcha. One of the best waitresses/bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of tipping? Thanks for consistently getting me drunk, Krista!   There's pool, shuffle board, trivia cards, board games, kitschy paintings, a fake fireplace playing on loop, leg lamps, and enough televisions to send you into a pop culture coma with their soft, hypnotizing glow. This is the type of place where I can show up at five and drink straight through to ten or later without even knowing it, and thankfully, without even coming close to breaking the bank.   I've been around for the \"wacky\" antics that others have brought up as negative (one o'clock shirtless shots, fish races, and thematic discounts--moustache Monday and wig Wednesday, and so on) but hardly anyone participates. And I've never been to Monkey Pants when it's exuded a \"frat bar atmosphere.\" Come during happy hour and you're more likely to see the local flavor propped up around the island bar (I dig an island bar) than the kind of people barhopping down the Mill Avenue strip. There's just enough buffer room to keep them at bay.  So if you're comfortable enough to put aside pretension and indulge in a little kitsch, I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon!  And if that doesn't convince you, maybe these six little words will:  Bacon. Wrapped. Deep. Fried. Hot. Dog.  A nacho cheese covered coronary on a bun. I never knew death could taste so delicious.",

Not a great sale so far, I know.   BUT, what's so great about Monkeypants is that it's not about flash or sizzle, or about broad appeal. It's a goofy little neighborhood bar with sassy waitresses who serve up delicious wings and cold beer. The juke box plays everything from Ludicris to Grand Funk Railroad, there's plenty of sports on TV, and the expansive patio (along with no-nonsense bouncers) keeps the riff raff out.   If you're looking for Affliction T-shirts and overly tan women in short skirts, Monkeypants is definitely not the bar for you, but if you want to share postgame laughs with your softball team while eating food that's not very good for you, you can't do much better than the Pants.",

You will like Monkey Pants if:  *you want a multitude of TVs to watch various sporting events *you appreciate friendly bartenders *you want cheap drinks (my Stella drafts were $4.50 which isn't bad at all and my Bud Light draft was $2.50) *you like bar games (pool, shuffleboard, and board games are all available to play) *you like places with mixed crowds *you don't want to dress up to go to a bar (I'm pretty sure I could have rolled up in a hoodie, jeans, and flip flops and still have been overdressed) *you like obscure songs from the '80s (for some reason that dominated the jukebox selections last night) *you want to chill on a couch with a drink in front of a faux fireplace  Overall, Monkey Pants is not a place that takes itself seriously. It has a loyal clientele from what I could tell as the bartender seemed to know a lot of the folks who wandered in.  My husband and I will definitely be returning when we are in the mood for a few drinks, sports, and shuffleboard.",

Monkey Pants takes \"Campy\" and \"Kitschy\" and magnifies those terms by 1,000.  This place is not pretty in its strip mall glory, and would be considered a dive by most folks.  I was on sensory overload, taking in the fish tanks, bad decor, construction paper turkey/hand cut-outs, grandma couches and grandma lamps, the leg lamp from the Christmas Story, the video-feed fireplace looping in the corner -- all the while trying to envision myself in a pilgrim get-up.  She wasn't kidding.   Some co-workers and I found ourselves here for their $3.95 hot wing night happy hour and had cheep drinks, plus a complimentary grape tootsie roll shot.

    "text": "(aka. SKETCHY TEMPE with BONNIE G, Part One of Three)  I was in Tempe. I was having coffee. I was sedate. I wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss Kafka or something boring. And so I called up the town's most famous resident to see what was goin' down.  \"Um, YOU need to see sketchy Tempe. It is time. And I will be the one who will show it to you. Meet me at Time Out Lounge. No, wait. Meet me at Monkey Pants. Yes, Monkey Pants!\"  And so I did.   Monkey Pants! Sorry folks, but this name is nonsensically awesome. I walked in and sat myself at the round bar, joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves, each staring into nowhere in particular. Well drinks for $2.50, served in a standard kitchen glass. Nice! I proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my Tempe tour guide.  We were approached by the bartender to do discounted Patron shots....but only if we wore sombreros. There was barely anyone here on a Sunday night, and I'm of the kind who doesn't care anyway, and the thought of me and Bonnie G sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time, but shots were not on my agenda for the night. Alas.  I then got a royal tour of the place, including the great leg lamp (actually it's two legs, not just one!), shuffleboard, pool tables, couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen TV, ample board games and another section with tables and chairs, which is where we sat, under the painting of the teddy bear in Richard Simmons gear.   Other patrons were seated all over the large space, so everyone had their own private area in a way. I actually really dug this. I'm not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like \"it's happening.\" Sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway. So I may sound decrepit, but I'm really not that old. I swear.  Sure, Monkey Pants has frat-party gimmicks throughout the day, but this place has no pretense whatsoever. How can you even take it seriously? Even it doesn't take itself seriously.   I mean, it's just sitting there. In a strip mall. In Tempe. With a painting of a teddy bear wearing Richard Simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine. Waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now.  And enjoy the now we did.   All thanks to my Sketchy Tempe tour guide.  4 stars.  (end of Part One)",

The servers are friendly and the drinks are cheap.  I like the shuffleboard table :-) .  I have been here during the day and at night. It's not a bad place to watch football on a Sunday. They have a lot of TVs, and it's not hard to find a table in front of a TV and get the server to put on whichever game you want to watch.   My one complaint is that I have never seen this place crowded, even on weekend nights. Bring a bunch of friends that you want to hang out with, because there aren't many people to meet here.",

There are definitely some \"characters\" who will get up and sing there (I'm thinking of you death metal Christina Perri singing girl).  My biggest complaint is the music was cranked up TOO high.  it overpowered the singers and also made my ears hurt!  my throat was hoarse from trying to shout/talk to my friends all night.",

The glass was sticky and seemed dirty. The orange in my Blue Moon looked like it was sliced a few days ago.   The guy in charge of the karaoke (someone told me he is one of the owners) that sits on the back table smoking his E-cigarette by his laptop is a dick. Some drunk guy tipped him to cut the queue for karaoke and he took it. The guy came back and asked to go again. One thing let to another and they started fighting in the middle of the bar. As we started to look for security we realized something.... What security?! No one even Asked for my ID when I entered the bar.   Finally after a few minutes one of the other owners/ staff stormed through and almost knocked me over. They roughed the drunk guy out. Not even 10 minutes later we spot the drunk guy in the bar yet again... How? .. Remember? No bouncers at this bar.   Bathrooms? .. Filthy. I'm pretty sure I stared at a piece of crap on the top of the toilet paper holder. I could not believe someone would do that. Like seriously WHY?!   On yea and I tried to get a second drink and the bartender asked me what I wanted however she absolutely forgot.   Bottom line. Worst bar I have ever Been to.  Don't do it.",

The bartender and her friend just kept on with their conversation, and when the bartender finally moved to get some work done, she still didn't acknowledge me.  Two apparent regulars at the bar, however, received new drinks.  At this point, the person I was at this bar with who comes rather frequently came over, and I said out loud, \"I think I'm invisible.\"  It wasn't until she saw I was with a familiar face that I got any acknowledgement at all.

So if you don't like greasy food, these are the last thing you should order. But dang, they are awesome. :)  So, I like shuffleboard. Enough that I've played for shirts before (of which I won, by the way). When my opponent lost their shirt, Monkey Pants and any other patrons didn't even seem to mind. After all, they have a shirtless shot 1-2x a night anyways so it isn't completely uncommon to see shirtless people in here.  Drinks seem to be reasonable here as well, especially if you order some of their special drinks.  Food is pretty decent as well and I'd put it about one step above bar food in some cases.  I'm not sure how long they have been doing it... but they had a \"power saver\" night where they wouldn't use lights, but rather candles for their lighting. As stupid as it sounds, I REALLY loved it. The bartenders also dressed up and it ended up feeling like a speak-easy. Speaking of bartenders, they are pretty dang attentive. I think I've received some of the fastest service here.  Overall, I like this place. I wish I lived closer so I could just walk there. I could see this as being my local watering hole.  PS - They have a lot of board games too. So if you're looking to spice things up. Grab an old fashioned board game and have at it!",

I honestly thought it was going to be a waste of time, especially since the karaoke wasn't even more than two people and NO crowd.

    "text": "I was invited to Monkey Pants for a friends going away party. There was several of us there and I was definitely looking forward to having a good time since i'm a big fan of dive bars. I arrived and most everyone was already there enjoying their drinks. I waited about 15 minutes before I asked someone if we even had a waitress.... My buddy told me there was only 1 waitress/bartender working. After another 5 min I decided to just go to her at the bar. As I was getting up she was heading our way. She explained that this was her first day back from not bartending for a few years and she was the only one scheduled for another hour and a half. This made me change my game plane and I started ordering 2 beers so I wouldn't have to wait for a refill quickly. I gotta say for it just being her she hustled the best she could and I give her props, however, management should have known Friday nights gets busy and they should have at least had a waitress scheduled. It wasn't really right for the employee or the customer to have to deal with this.   I ordered a burger with green chile and continued my 2 beer orders and that went rather well... The burger took a long time, im guessing a little over 30 minutes. I was a little frustrated with that but the burger was actually really good. I asked for some condiments and never got them, im sure it was because the waitress/bartender was slammed so I wasn't too worried about it.   After awhile a waitress and another bartender showed up to take over and everything started running a lot more smoothly. Beers were flowing, shots were going down smooth, and we got our ordered items quickly. Around 8pm Karaoke started and it was on!!! I chose a couple songs and handed them to the DJ... I was told my songs weren't available.... I gave him a couple more and nope.... So if your planning to Karaoke make sure your gonna stick to the same ol same ol songs... Thunder Rolls, Baby got back, Grease, or a balls song. The DJ offered me to pay for songs I wanted to sing. I was going to tip him anyway so I paid the 2 dollars for 1 of my songs. Sang the song and dipped... Overall its a pretty chill bar, manager screwed the one waitress hopefully that doesn't become a pattern on Friday nights. Id roll thru again if my friends wanted to go there again.",

Ol' Monkey Pants didn't let him down.  We didn't wait long for drinks, and the bartender was on her game.  Plus she was cordial.  She may not have looked like she was having fun, but she reassured us after a bit of conversation that she was enjoying the night.  We just hit the place up for a beverage or six, and strayed from the food.  Not for any good reason.  We had previously ate is all. The Fireball flowed, and flowed well that night.  All the way up to the \"Shirtless Shots\" hour, and all I can say is, it's a good niche.  You would think it would be pants, but then again... that's probably not a good idea. Good people, in a good bar, and everyone was just out for a bit of fun that night it seems.  Bravo, and brava to them.  All in all, Monkey Pants was a good time, and it was a nice change of scenery from Mill Ave, and that shenanigans.

Obviously they have been drinking! Several of them come out, like they just had a little party in there. Now I know the legal time for bar closes 2 a.m., and an hour to clean up isn't that unreasonable. Anything after that is a party, especially when some of the employees look like they're staggering. This is something that should be reported to the Liquor Board. As it's not safe for the area, and it's illegal for the employee to be drinking after the 2 a.m., or employees to be drinking while they're working. I'd really like to find the owner of this bar and ask him why his employees stay so late, and come out drunk! Oh and let's not forget the fact that they over serve, and there are literally people passed out in their cars in the parking lot! The Liquor Board needs to investigate this establishment.",

And it is so much fun to sing on the stage. The DJ is awesome I think he is perfect for the job he is fun and knows how to throw a joyful ambience in the place. Definitely going back there !!",

The bar is totally relaxed and anything goes.  \"Come as you are\" for sure.  Staff is great, and Erica does an awesome job bartending, even when they're super busy.  If you're not happy with your drink she is quick to fix you something else.  The decor is cheesy like one would expect at a dive bar, but lots of fun for groups to have a good time and enjoy cheap drinks!  The food is actually pretty good for bar food.  Fries are delicious and fresh!  Only complaint is that the soda thing at bar always seems to be flat, so I don't get any liquor mixed with sodas from the bar.  The DJ is hillarious and it's usually a mixed bag of folks who keep things interesting.  You can literally get drunk for $20 here.  Lots of fun and probably my favorite bar in Ahwatukee/Tempe/Chandler area.",

Out on a rather impromptu night out we stopped in here after 10pm on Easter Eve.  Anna M. had mentioned that their website said something about appearances from Jesus and the Easter Bunny, and sho' nuff as soon as we walk in I see a  Girl wearing an Bunny head and a Jesus in a corner offering the Stations -Trials that a faithful Monkey Pants patron could go through for a few shots and a t-shirt (Facing insults, washing Jesus' feet, drinking wine from a sponge, among other things).  Also as the clock hits 1am they have shirtless shots, where everyone who takes off their shirt is offered a shot.  Now its mostly the boys doing this.  Either way it is entertaining.        This is definitely nothing fancy about this place.  Just a down to earth slightly dive-y location where you can drink cold beer, have some food and play a little pool if you choose.  I may have to go back and try their grub here soon....",

The bartender looked like the main male character from (500) Days of Summer. Great. The drinks were cheap and strong. Even greater. This is probably the reason that I even thought the bartender looked like a quasi Joseph Gordon-Levitt.   Hands down, the BEST part of the night is when its time for 'free shots if you take off your shirt'.  Ideally this is meant for the ladies of the bar. The reality, however, is much more entertaining. Suddenly there are dozens of shirtless men (who really shouldn't be shirtless in any circumstance) parading around the bar.  Anyone first walking into the establishment would think they've entered a bad porno or some sort of explicit party.  Its hilarious but unfortunately that image will be forever burned into my memory, regardless of how much alcohol was circulating throughout my nueral cavity.  I had to hold back one star only because the crowd is a bit to 'frat boy' esque for my liking. Although it is par for the course being located on Mill Ave near ASU campus.",

Picture the biggest beer castle ever. From the floor to the ceiling. Yes, gloriously tacky is a wonderful description.  The music her was mostly country and rock. Sorry, Lady Gaga fans. The crowd was very mixed. It seems many people from many different backgrounds come here to bask in Monkey Pants' soft, tacky glow. The drinks specials were good, the waitstaff was very attentive, and they had many TVs with various sports events on.   One of the coolest things about Monkey Pants is the boardgames.

The flavors were perfect together, I would actually go back to order one again. You must try this very strange combo that is surprisingly so good and cooked to order.  The buns were VERY stale.

It's your classic dimly-lit dive bar with good drink specials and entertainment abound (board games, tv, pool, etc).  The bartender and waitresses did a great job keeping everyone's cups/shots full, and the bartender was a great conversation. The karaoke DJ is a character! He looks like a certain X-Men and kept us entertained with the most-interesting music selection in-between performances. If you tip him in bills or alcohol, you have a much better shot at not waiting forever in-between songs. On a typical Saturday night, it could be as long as an hour to wait without tipping him. This is definitely an interesting watering hole, worth the time to throw a few back and people watch.",

I had them hot, but there was an interesting Monkey Pants sauce option that I might try if I go there again.

The bar has a tradition called \"shirtless shot\" where everyone takes their shirt off at 1am and receives a free shot. Interesting and fun concept, however, this leaves women susceptible to being followed around by strange men all night asking \"are you going to do the shirtless shot? You should do the shirtless shot. Why won't you do the shirtless shot?\" which obviously puts a damper on the evening, and as such lowers my rating. Service was also a little slow, although the bartender was very nice.  Overall, fun time... I just would go with a group (or go with a male) to avoid being irritated.",

Awhile later the exact same thing happened while I was waiting to close my tab. I stood there while everyone got served around me even though I'd been waiting a long time and they'd just walked up. A very nice and very drunk man called one of the bar tenders by name and told her to help me and that's when I finally got to close my tab (I give drunk dude five stars). I was there to spend time with my friends, but I spent a good amount of time waiting around the bar wondering what was happening. I understand being busy, but this was blatantly not that. Outside a man who got his drink within seconds of walking up commented and laughed about how long I stood there soooo awesome.",

    "text": "New to Arizona and Monkey Pants was my first karaoke bar sesh here! It was interesting...   I went with 40 other young professionals for a meetup. Otherwise, the crowd was filled with middle aged sketchy people, with an exception of a few other youngins. There were several TVs for the karaoke that were flickering like you're in a horror movie. The place quickly reached it's max capacity around 10-11pm on this Saturday night. There were several talented people who can sing, but most performers were off key and drunky face. If you have not sung yet, your song request will take priority to those who have requested and sung already that night. There were two mics up on stage, so we were able to go up as a group several times to perform. I broke out my back stage dancing moves and got silly. Drinks were reasonably priced. However, if your drink is under $10 and you close your tab, they will charge a $1 fee.  At 1am, they give out a free shot for those who take off their shirts, including the guys and girls. Surprisingly, majority of the people partake in that event. There is this girl, regular to Monkey Pants nicknamed \"tits meggie\", who apparently takes out her boobs and rest them on the bar. Be on the lookout, or don't... Idk, I just hear things. Oh, and my buddy first notice a threesome in the guys bathroom (1 guy and 2 girls).   This place isn't all that classy but it was a good experience overall. Would I ever go back by myself? No way Jose. With a large large group of young people? Definitely.",

    "text": "Well, thinking back, that post was crap, I was threatened to be 86'd if I didn't change my original posting. I don't plan on going back to this place any time soon... So here it is...  Last time I went to Monkey Pants, the server walked by my fiancee and I twice without even asking if we needed anything while on the patio. After about 30 minutes, I finally walked inside and up to the bar to ask for drinks. We finished said drinks and thought about ordering food. But the server didn't come out to the patio for about another 15-20 mins. So I went into the bar, ordered another round and closed out.  It'd be great if this place would go back to the way it used to be with out the throngs of college kids that acted like knuckleheads or elitists. I enjoyed this bar initially because it had a strong blue collar vibe and was fun to have conversation and drink. Ever since Jen (think that was her name) could no longer do karaoke there, that's kind of when it started to go down hill. The guy that took her place sucked. He was gender bias, I got skipped over like 5 times on Wednesday nights. The servers they initially had were awesome. Although I can't speak for the current wait staff, if they're the same as they were about a year or two ago, they could look like they give less a crap about being at work or serving.  The original post I had was in regards to the owner being a complete jerk. I had, at one time, been allowed to bring my dog on the patio at this bar. I had (before I even brought him down) gotten permission from the bar manager and the bar tender to bring my dog down. They said it was cool. I brought him down, we never had any problems, he never bit anybody, he never barked at anyone. He just chilled while we drank beer and my friends spoiled him with table scraps. Fast forward about 3 months after that, the same bar tender one night decided I couldn't have the dog there. He yelled at me and told me \"I've told you before you can't have the dog here!\"... Problem was, he never said that to me before. I had even had his permission. When I argued with him about it and pointed out that he had never said that, he threatened to 86 me. When I posted a scathing review of the joint for their hypocrisy. He then threatened further to 86 me for the review.  I've seen the guy a few times, since he's worked there (he no longer does). I came to understand, not through him, that the owner is a complete power monger. He watches the cameras all the time and flip-flops on management decisions all the time. He apparently had called the bar to yell at the server to threaten me to remove the dog and the review.   Needless to say, even though I live right around the corner from this bar, I will never be back there again. I have a new local hang out that's my after work relaxation, oh, and they allow my dog on the patio too.",

Plus, the fire place burning on the big screen TV brought me back to Washington if only for a minute. Friendly staff, good drinks, clean rest rooms all make Monkey Pants a winner in my book.

    "text": "Bars that serve food...sometimes it's the greatest thing in the world when you've put down too many, and are in need of something to soak up enough alcohol so that the next round can be taken down with little to no pain.  Other times it's the stupidest thing you can do, and the grease (which at this point is not the word) and booze make a simultaneous comeback that night or the next morning.  So good bar food is very important in the grand scheme of things.  While good bar food isn't always the case, Monkey Pants in Tempe makes a strong case for a nice meal when you are close to hanging over a toilet.  Located in a shopping center on the corner of Southern and Mill is convenient for those who are waiting for their car at the tire shop that is also located is that area, or for college students looking to get away from the \"scene\" of Mill Rd, closer to the University.  The bar offers indoor and outdoor, with the outdoor seating usually reserved for those you prefer to die of lung cancer.  Inside the bar is enormous with a plethora or choices of seating.  There is an area with pool tables and other bar games, and a raised platform like area complete with TVs and booth table seating.  Of course if you don't like the whole table thing, the bar is nice to sit at as well.  One of my favorite amenities at Monkey Pants is the board games.  While you are waiting for food, feel free to grab Monopoly or Sorry to play with friends.  The menu at Monkey Pants puts a fun spin on the typical bar menu.  While the usual suspects of wings, potato skins and other bar appetizers all grace the front page, the names of the burgers stand out as the focal point of the menu.  Each burger is named after a state, and is garnished with foods from the region.  And if that weren't enough, bacon can be added to anything for a buck.  I started with an order of wings and a side of onion rings.  The burger I ordered was the Nebraska Burger, which to a picky eater is perfect; it's the only plain burger.  I also added bacon...hey, it's only a dollar.  The appetizers where good and came out quickly.  The wings sauce had a nice flavor and heat, and if I were to guess, did not come out of a can as is.  This is definitely a house recipe.  The onion rings weren't too bad either, but after eating both (with a friend, I'm not that big of a gluten), I did feel like the burger might be a little too much...but I, in the name of writing a review, forged through the fullness.  The burger was cooked just as I asked, and was perfect in size.  The fries, which can kill a meal quickly, were crispy and flavorful.  As I started the main course, I knew that there was no way, that the food in front of me would not survive my stay at the restaurant.  Service was great.  The sarcastic wit of my waitress made me feel like I was a regular, and quite welcomed any time I liked.  The food, place and service were a complete package of what I am looking for in bar food.  The specialty days that they offer, i.e.: Wig Wednesday, wear a wig get happy hour prices, make me want to frequent the place over and over again.  I would recommend Monkey Pants for anyone in the mood for a good environment, nice food and fun service.  And if you can stay for the One O'clock Shirtless Shot, I would recommend it.  Sure it's a bunch of dudes with their shirts off, but it's free if you join in, and every now and then it's a coed event.",

It's got that \"clubhouse\" atmosphere with the Christmas Story lamp and Parker Bros Games. So about the 3rd time I'm there, I go into the bathroom and come out to a bar of shirtless people , thinking WTF? O, a shirtless shot! No, No thank you, I'm fine WITH my shirt. I'm a big boy and I'm sure no one wants to see my Buddha belly and Dungeons and Dragons tattoo anyway. They have a kitchen that stays open late and has some great wings. Cajun on the grill, mmmmm mm, try them. Chris, Krista and Nate are some good tenders, ready to serve. I usually stop there after going to the Timeout, on my way home. Besides the Frat Boy atmosphere, my only beef is: one time I was shooting pool and the waitress somehow got about 8 shots on my tab, in addition to the 5 beers that I did actually have. Getting the mistake fixed was as simple as getting scolded by the head bartender about being clear about what drinks go on my tab, umm I only had beer, sorry. lol? I now pay as  I go, problem solved.",

It is a great, inexpensive date spot, it is cozy and the staff took care of us. Their menu is large and we were happy with the food we received. The patrons at this bar seemed to be pretty diverse and overall friendly crowd.   They have good weekly specials, including half priced wings on Tuesdays. The wings themselves were on par, maybe slightly worse then Wingstop. That is a not a bad thing, I was very happy with my order and the price was super reasonable.   Two small tidbits you will find, one the stage itself, really isn't all that loud. You may be happy about this or kind of annoyed. As singers are singing to themselves more then anyone else. They aim the speakers at the singer to make it seem like you are louder then you are. Second, the men's restroom is really badly designed. Right when you walk into the bathroom the mirrors face the urinals in such a way I saw instant wang hanging out in the mirror. Both funny and alarming.  Still, I liked this place a lot and will be back soon!",

We had no way to get help --no one asked me once if I needed for them to call me a taxi!! Just because someone is NOT inebriated doesn't mean they don't need a little help at closing time--MAKE sure that your loyal customers are not left alone in front of your establishment in the middle of the night! You might create a policy around this. In my opinion it's needed. If something would've happened to one us - well - give that some thought please!!!",

My friends and I soon became fans of their karaoke nights as well.   Food and drinks are great. Service can be a bit slow, but it is to be expected in a dive bar. With that said, all of the staff is incredibly nice and friendly. There always seems to be some type of drink special happening as well.   Monkey Pants is a great place for a night out with friends or just for a casual solo drink. And who can beat a shirtless shot? :)",

Drinks are at a good price, and at 1am they give out free shots, which never hurts.  The karaoke is pretty good.  They don't have the latest selection of songs, but they have some classic hits in there that are a blast to sing along with.  My biggest complaint is how the order of singers is chosen.  I feel like if you're a girl or you tip you get bumped right to the front of the line.  I wish this was a little more clear as the first time I put in a song request I waited probably 2-3 hours before my name came up.  While it typically looks a little dark and dreary most of the year, on Christmas the place was brightly lit up with tons of Christmas lights and decorated with wrapping paper!  I wish it was that way the rest of the year as I found it to be a much more vibrant atmosphere.  I'll be back for sure, this place has been a classic with my group for a long time now, and despite its shortcomings, we've always had a great time.",

Thankfully I was with some Monkey Pants veterans who got everything set with the DJ and somehow got me on stage. Seems like there may be some complaints about groups getting out of order to sing, so just make sure to tip the guy well and you should be good to go.   I came super hungry and apparently the kitchen was closed at 7pm on a Saturday night because the bar was short staffed, but I was able to hold out after drinking a couple Kilt Lifters. The kitchen finally opened and I got nachos - which weren't that great but I was starving. Seems like most people are a lot happier with the wings!  Drinks were pretty cheap, food was alright, free popcorn is a plus and the karaoke is a blast. Definitely worth checking out and I'll be coming back for our next monthly karaoke night!",

My go-to drink is a bloody Mary which usually comes out pretty tasty. The bartenders are usually pretty nice and accommodating. The facility is usually clean and kept tidy. Well done Monkey Pants!  So why 3 stars?  Cons- This is a karoke bar. The karaoke jockey's are rude (one jockey  actually told my husband to \"get the f*ck off the stage while he was singing), and another (a female) had me wait over an HOUR to sing and proceeded to tell me she didn't have my song and pushed me to the back of the line (after I had already tipped her $5). The song options are limited and the wait to sing is always LONG. The same people usually sing multiple songs leading me to believe its all about who you know in this place.  If I want to enjoy a good burger and drink with my husband, this is an establishment I will definitely frequent.   For Karoke and fun, I'll be heading to FINAL ROUND where the jockey's are friendly and inviting. Did I mention when they didn't have my song they (Travis at final round ) actually found it for me? This is a shining example of customer service!",

We are at a near by office and had plenty of time....thank goodness because we wasted 45mins if our lives we will never ever get back.   Now the decor was interesting and topic for discussion....we felt like it could be a fun lunch spot. Now just to check out the wait staff and food. The waitress did not acknowledge us, and had to be flagged down to ask if it was okay to sit at a table.   She said she would be over shortly with menus.  We sat, decided to be ready when she came and pulled up their full menu online.  So far so good.  Found some nice items and decided on sharing an appetizer and then an entree.  After 10 mins (with a very slow bar to keep her from us) I went to her armed with our order.  She told me the nachos were on sale, so we changed our appetizer to that and then we waited.....and waited....our water (which was ordered at time of food) came out after about 10mins.  She said when the nachos came out she would put in our philly cheese steak sandwich in.  I told her to go ahead and put it in.  10 minutes go by, then 15, then 20.....now I have already decided I earned the tip that would traditionally be given to wait staff.  I go back to the bar and ask how the nachos are coming along.  After some polite dialogue about sour cream, guacamole, and salsa I return to our table.  She comes within the next 5 minutes carrying both chicken nachos and Philly cheesesteak sandwich.   The ONLY good food were the French fries and even they were cold.  The nachos had raw chicken, and the entire meal was cold-nacho cheese and all.  The sandwiches skimpy portions of meat, mushrooms, and onions.  The location has potential to be a good mind for the right owner....but current operations will only see money made by drunken patrons on busy nights of karaoke!",

The rest of the place follows suit.  The staff is quirky, always yells \"HELLO\" as you enter, and has no problem just chatting it up with you about whatever is on their minds.  There is always free popcorn, and plenty of beers to chose from.  My advice would be to stick with beers in the bottle.  I've had some funky stomach issues after drinking beer on draft there.  The food here is surprisingly good.  Grilled, meaty chicken wings smothered in BBQ sauce are tops on my list, and they have more burger options that you know what to do with.  There are quite a lot of TVs to watch, a juke box that is always playing local favorites (when they don't have a band playing), and there are a couple of pool tables and a shuffle board table as well.

    "text": "As a bar, Monkey Pants seems to want it both ways.  They have a 1:00am shirtless shot routine that makes the place feel like an annoying college bar.  At the same time, the atmosphere is decidedly low-key, especially considering the \"wacky\" and \"outrageous\" name.  I've been there on a few Friday nights and, each time, could count on one hand the number of patrons.  If nobody is going there, it must not just be me.  Maybe it's better during lunchtime...  Time Out Lounge is in the same strip-mall.  I'd recommend drinking there instead.",

But it's a great lunch spot.  I really wish I didn't go to lunch alone because I'd love to make use of those board games.  And it just seems sad to play with the shuffle board by myself.    Today when eating lunch, 4 TV's in front of me were set to Espn2, Nascar, The movie Saw, and Teletubbies.  Well, first Barney ended - then it was Teletubbies.  On one of the many TV's in the other room I saw they also have some cooking show on which I wish I'd been in front of while eating.  Very theme appropriate.  I do love their full leg, fishnet lamp.  And some of their cheesy signage is fun.  But I'd love to hang out with friends in their little mini-living room on the raised platform with the big screen TV in the corner playing the \"fireplace\" video on constant loop.  Love that thing.  But - I go for lunch.  Their Philly is good, and their burgers are pretty decent for a bar.  Nothing amazing, but ok.  The place is nicer on the inside than I expected, but still felt very casual.  They definitely get bonus points for the popcorn machine behind the bar.  That plus those board games take this to a solid 4 star experience based on my lunch time experiences.",

My friends and I stopped in here on our Saturday daytime dive bar crawl (think 6 hours of drinking total for like 25 bucks!) and the place was dead.  There were a few patrons at the bar, and they all looked like they were ready to pass out...at three in the afternoon!    Imagine a scene in whichever cheesy vampire drama you've gotten into recently when we opened up the door with the bright AZ sunshine pouring in.  Aggghhhh!  Shut the door!  You're letting the darkness out!    That being said, I see the potential, and reading the reviews below I refuse to rate this solely on this experience.  I'd love to see some of the fun-loving whippersnappers below in the confines of this promising environment.  The drinks were pretty cheap, and the food was not bad (Wisco Cheese Curds Whaaaaaat!).

My friends would ask what I was up to all evening and I could say, \"Oh, I spent the evening hanging out in Monkey Pants.\"   I've never been there for shirtless shots, but I appreciate any place that's willing to serve breakfast and beer at the same time.  In some ways, the decor says, \"Like me! I'm trying too hard.\" but it grew on me.  Or maybe that's the liquor talking.  Our cocktailer was nice.  She flashed a genuine smile.  Not a dead shark eyes, Stepford wife smile.  I tip extra for real smiles.  I looked up to the TV screen expecting to see a bunch of grown men dressed up in costumes running around like super heros while fat old guys dressed like zebras keep score on who looks less ridiculous. Which is what usually appears on such screens.  It took me a few moments to remember how to focus my eyes and realize I was actually staring at an image of Leonard Nimoy from the sixties wearing a blue v-neck and  pointy ears.  Spock?  My god.  I think I just creamed my monkey pants.  I will definitely go there again.",

    "text": "The wife and I were looking for something low-key and random to do on Halloween so we gave this place a try.  It was pretty early (8ish) so the place wasn't very busy at all.  That was a good thing because this ensured we could sit wherever we wanted and there was nobody playing that shuffleboard game thing they have.  I LOVE that game!  We had a few reasonably priced drinks while we played then ordered some burgers.  Their burger selection is surprisingly good with tons of topping to choose from.  You really wouldn't expect it from a \"dive\" bar.  Our burgers were big and juicy and tasted excellent.  I don't think they were pre-made and frozen, but if they were, kudos to the defroster!  The service was excellent as our waitresses were fast and friendly.  For some reason we had 3 different waitresses during the 3 or so hours were were there, but it was ok.  I have to give a shout out to the waitress that took our food order because she brought me a pitcher of diet coke so I could refill it myself.  AWESOME!!  When I eat I somehow drink tons of diet coke and it is always a pain for the waitress to keep on refilling and a pain to wait for another one.  Anyway, we didn't even get to that point because she brought the pitcher right away.  It was like she knew me!  Very impressive!  The price was very reasonable for what we ordered and we had fun.  It seems like most of the people who hang out there are regulars so they are pretty friendly.  We even made some new friends when they challenged us to shuffleboard for drinks.  Good stuff!!",

Anyone could fit in here and feel like the scene is just right for what you want. I was initially misled by their funky daily specials, thinking this place was more a fleshy, drunken, routy, sloppy cheap beer joint. Alas, the clouds have parted. I love the board games and have recently fallen in love with the shuffle board. Though the space between the pool tables and shuffle board is quite narrow, this makes for the creation of new friendships (or drunken aquaintences anyway).  The food is fine - I've only ordered food here once, but it was pretty good. My will power however is often stretched to the max around the popcorn after a few shots on Whiskey Makes you Frisky Fridays. This can be both good and bad depending on how much popcorn or maybe how much whiskey is involved...Either way, I will make a conscious effor to be regular here now.",

The best part about the trivia night is that the winners of every round get a prize (more incentive to win, no?) Monkey Pants has a very chill and homey feel to it, and I really enjoy that. Honestly, my friend and I plan on making as many trivia nights as we can because it was so fun. The food is also nicely priced with daily deals and happy hour deals.",

    "text": "Monkey Pants, The Pants, M Pizzy... Call it what you will, but Monkey Pants is and will always be one of my favorite bars in Tempe. I love this place because it's a bar that reminds its customers that they can let loose and not take themselves so seriously. Customers are also kindly reminded that they can receive a free shot just for showing off a little skin during the 1 o'clock shirtless shot! It's nonsense like this that made me a regular here, and it's nonsense like this that will always encourage me to bring my friends here for a good time.  The Pants isn't all about wackiness though, they take a few things seriously, like their food. A lot of the menu is typical bar fare, but there are a few things that stand out. In an attempt to cater to the influx of new-to-town transplants, they have burgers named by their state of influence. I definitely nod in the direction of the New Mexico, the Arizona and the Georgia burgers. They are all amazing, and if you're feeling silly, go for the Alaskan burger...that's sure to make your server (or Chris the bartender) chuckle. Next up, The Pants' ranch. They seriously need to bottle that and sell it. That ranch is the tastiest that I've ever had, and when paired with the fries, it's what the French would call, \"Bueno!\" ...or something like that. The ranch can also be paired with some pretty delicious hot wings as well. If you decide to go with those, get them charred on the grill with extra sauce!  In my opinion, any night is a good night for M Pizzy. But, if I had to choose a couple to recommend, they would be Wednesday for Wig Wednesday (happy hour prices from 8pm until close if you wear a wig...which are provided...and $2 off burgers) and Thursday ($5 hot dog special, live comedy and goldfish races after 10pm). Monkey Pants is a happening spot; go and get yo ass in The Pants!",

The waitress was literally angry we were there.  The prices were ok.  Quality?  When your coke doesn't taste like coke (we're talking about soda here), the lemonade doesn't taste like lemonade, and the nachos seem like they've been prepared a few hours ago... not my place.  The decor confused me.  It seemed like they wanted to try for a sports restaurant, with a ton of TVs, but the TVs were fighting with the grandma's living room section.  I didn't feel the vibe, in fact I felt the desire to go home.  They have a free comedy show on Thursday nights as well.  The MC kept reminding us that you get what you pay for, but he must have been lying because they didn't pay me to sit through it.  Just about nothing offends me, but these \"comedians\" had offense on lock.  Jokes about rape and abortion, one after another, and nobody was laughing - time to give it up.",

The food is ok, but I don't find the kitchen containing any culinary surprises but the wings are fried, sauced and then grilled. That's nice. The service is fair.  I came here to meet people and play some games. I never got to the game part at all, but that's ok and I don't regret it. I have no doubts that I will get back here on one occasion or another.

    "text": "Not long ago I discovered I had a superpower; I'm invisible you see. I didn't know I was some sort of super being until I went to Monkey Pants. But right then and there, one faithful night my powers manifested and with a snap of your fingers I was invisible. Suddenly none of the bartenders at this place could see me.  No matter where I stood or how hard I smiled, tried to look friendly and make eye contact all of them stared right past me like I wasn't even there.  I didn't want to startle anyone so I didn't cry out, whistle or yell at any of the staff and seeing as how I was now invisible I was afraid that if I waved my arms or beckoned I might poke out the eye of an innocent bystander (with great power comes great responsibility don't you know). Besides I wouldn't do any of those things if I were a regular Joe customer visible for all to see; I use a thing called \"bar etiquette\" and disdain folks that are rude and do those sorts of things to any hard working bar staff. With visions of fighting crime and seeing bevies of naked women unseen and was gleefully giggling at my stroke of good fortune when another customer asked me what was so funny.   I was crushed. When the bus boy asked if I was finished with my drink I came to the sobering realization that my power of invisibility only worked on the bartending staff of Monkey pants; my new found superpowers had their limitations. When I stood too close to one of the regulars I was visible too and was eventually served.  I went back to the table on the smoking patio that my lovely companions and I had claimed and excitedly explained to my well dressed and attractive female companions of my new found powers (and their limitations) and was dumb struck to find out that they too had manifested the powers of invisibility as none of the wait staff could see them either. And sure enough no less than three waitresses passed by in less than ten minutes, our table void of drinks and none of them could see our pleading features.  In fact as the night dragged along the waitress seemed more interested in getting to their shifty drinks after work and even placing regulars at our table failed to garnish us any attention.  As last called neared there were so many people wearing monkey pants attire on the smoking patio it was hard to tell who was working and who was working on a buzz. Not that it mattered because we were still invisible you see.   Through-out the evening after sitting drink-less for dozens of minutes on end, my invisible friends and I had to stoop to standing next to regulars at the bar to be seen just to get a drink. There were a number of these patrons that I wished my superpowers worked on; especially the girl that decided to point out my jeans were riding a little too low by putting her finger in my ass crack. During one of my extremely long and patient waits at the bar I ended up getting tired (a side effect of being invisible perhaps?) and leaned on one of the stickiest bars I've ever come across. People were eating food here too which amazed me because there didn't seem to be soap or a way to dry your hands in the restrooms and I could only imagine how dirty those fingers were that they were licking nacho grease off of.   Our night ended without incident and we left, unseen by the staff of course.   An interesting post script is that apparently the burned out neon sign that adorns this place was the source of our collective super powers because we're not invisible to bar and wait staff anywhere else but Monkey Pants. But rest assured, dear reader, that the next time I want a place with a smoking patio where I can use my super power of invisibility you'll be sure to see me at Monkey Pants...or will you?",

I went during the comedy night, so it was pretty packed. A lot of people had to stand and watch the people perform.   Not a bad crowd of comics either! Some were hilarious, some were so-so, but I totally give them props for going up there. That seem brutal.   I don't know if I'd ever come back, just because it's on the otherside of the world from where I live, but if my friend ever did an encore, I'd be there in a sec!",

    "text": "One of the worst bars in the Phoenix area. I've been here in years past and it was a dive....it's just what it is and always will be. I like dive bars.  Event: karaoke Saturday. Low energy Dj on his laptop who messes up everyones song consistently. That's about all that is guaranteed. He looked like a grubby Wolverine and was out to smoke/ talk on his phone once he figured out which magic button he could mash to play almost the correct song. I was there for 2 hours.... Ambiance: always known as a little bit icky dive bar (fine by me) this place has gotten worse! Bathrooms were filthy and there were dirty poo filled fish tanks next to the bar. On the counters were lovely flip flyers of things that go on every night including...\"Wigger Wednesday\" where you wear a wig. Not cute for business. You want my money? This is the b.s. you expect at a houseparty....where you would find more likeable characters and spend less money.  This time it had been 2 years since I came. Bought a round of drinks for my friends and watched as the \"bartender\" poured the equivalent of 1 1/2 shots of liquor total for 4 tall drinks. She then added Sprite to the shaker and mounded the pint glasses heaping with ice. Even then it couldn't be watered down enough so guess what? MORE SPRITE. I asked for an extra shot of vodka in each when she brought them to me. She then charged me $5 each drink for a 2 count (at best) which is half a pour for non bar people. So all in all I paid a fortune for 4 very weak tall drinks for my friends. I didn't have a fit because 3 of my friends were locals and I didn't want to make a fuss in case they went back. I left her $1.01 tip....and you know what that $.01 means when you works for tips. If she would have given me a full shot as a back I would have tipped her $7-8 for the drinks.  To top off the evening was \"shirtless shots\" where the woman bartender (see glasses of Sprite above) takes off her shirt (leaves bra on, thankfully) and pours premade 1/2 Chambord 1/2 Soda Water shots from pitchers as only shirtless dudes line up to the bar. I didn't see the whole bar, but 3 of the guys I went with went up for fun. One did not get a shot at all, which is ridiculous since our group had been taking turns buying entire rounds of drinks 4-5 at a time. It is a gimmick, but when in Rome, I get it. It was just such a let down of things that could have been made better with a better staff attitude and training, a little more consciousness and consistency.   Skip it. You're better driving into the desert and drinking your own Pucker and Sprite from a plastic cup.....and you'd have better music I'm sure of it.",

I ask her of she gave my card to someone else, she did. I ask her if she understands that these strangers could have taken down my CC info. She apologises...I ask for a manager because clearly she doesn't understand how bad it is to give a customers cc to someone else. After asking for a manager 3 times the bartender finally comes over 15 minutes later to apologize for charging someone else's bill on my card... wtf?! This is the first I hear I paid for someone else's bill too??? I am obviously upset about this and she immediately walks away saying \"you know what I've got other people to help, I tried being nice \" I followed her asking for a managers contact info and she simply went to the back of the bar... appalling... f**K this place.

The service wasn't super amazing but it was typical for your bar scene. The prices were average and the food was just okay.

After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable.    I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals.

    "text": "First of all, I'll start with the name.  I originally thought that this was a children's clothing store.  I don't like cutesy names for kid's clothing stores, so taking a name like that and applying it to a bar is enough to rile up the cranky old man inside of me.  But I digress.  I came here on a date (her choice), and got there a few minutes before she did...so I ordered a whiskey and diet.  The diet was flat.  I found a table and sat down and was messing around on my phone while waiting.  As I was viewing the 2011 Cardinals schedule on my phone, I saw something moving across the table out of the corner of my eye.  It was a cockroach.    Anyways, once she got to the bar, we had a couple other mild disappointments.  The waitress seemed scatterbrained for the first half of the time we were there.  She bought us drinks that we didn't order, and didn't bring us ones that we did.  However, after a while, she improved...I'm guessing that she was \"in the weeds\" as servers call it, when we got there.  Not a big deal, but obviously not impressive.  The girl I was with ordered what they call a \"vegetarian\" quesadilla.  I would have just called it a quesadilla.  There's not really any veggies in it.  Also, they are the only place I have ever been to that mentions Hepatitis on the menu, but they spelled it wrong.  Misspellings on menus also rile me up, what can I say?  All said, this is a below-average bar in my opinion.  I would go back, but only if a friend or someone wanted to go...not a recommendation in my book at all.",

She brought some sauce out for me to sample and  I know for sure food is on my to do list next time I come here.

The food is way above average for a dive bar, with decent prices and specials.  The bartenders have all been awesome.  The shirtless shots taste terrible, but who cares because it is a lot of fun getting a free shot for taking your shirt off.  The crowd is interesting and a little rough, but on busy nights they have security to keep out the super-drunk \"tough guys\".  They still have video trivia/poker, which is awesome.  Big, open space with a lot of tables.  Ideal for a large group.   I would give it 5 stars, but here are the negatives...  -shuffleboard table and Buck Hunter are gone -no more NFL package (used to be a great bloody mary specials and food specials while watching football on Sundays -- now the place is dead during football) -comedy night is no longer",

I asked for it cooked Medium, but it came out Well (...with every drop of moisture cooked out of it). Also, there was no sauce on the burger of any sort; so just a dry, airy, flavorless bun and a way overcooked burger. Exacerbating the problem was this mouth-drying peanut butter on my burger. I felt like I was in one of those \"Got Milk\" commercials. Not good.  Conceptually, the \"burgers across America\" idea is sound, but the execution is not. The quality and attention to detail (and taste) is not there. The staff (of one) was friendly, but the service was a bit slow (because there was only one person). Monkey Pants is not a very clean place either. They did have Guinness on tap though, which almost earns them a 3rd star.... Still, I'm not really a fan. I don't intend on returning.",

One the prices on the website did not reflect the actual price of the items, everything was one dollar more than expected, but worse was the food. We started off  with the nachos and everything was good until I had some of the sour cream, which was apparently old, if I could describe it, I would say it taste exactly how moldy sour cream smells, which I know sounds weird. After that we opened up our main entries and both of our fries were not even fully cooked,hell, they might as well have been grease traps.  The were soggy, overly oily, and raw in the middle. For the sandwiches my \"Monkey club\" was at best alright, but I sure as hell wouldn't call it a specialty, but my fiance did enjoy her tuna melt, so that was a plus. For this experience I was highly disappointed, especially for the fact that I spent nearly 30 dollars for this highly disappointing meal. If I go back and order anything to eat it will be wings, because I've never had an issue with that.",

    "text": "It's close to home...though I do not quite see where it gets it's Dive Bar reputation.  Granted, it's dark enough inside for my eyes to take 3 minutes to adjust after entering from the sun...and while the ambience is clean enough, the place seems a bit sleepy.  From my experiences, I have been there when the place was nearly empty as well as when it has been pretty busy.    The food...it is adequate for bar food.  This ain't the place to bring Mum for a special dinner...though if she enjoys burgers, wings, fish and chips or a Reuben along with a beer or other beverage, she will probably have a decent time.  Maybe I have not patronized Monkey Pants enough...I have yet to see a bar fight or anyone ejected for playing the fool.  One of the \"regulars\" has regaled me with tales on two visits, though, of some serious beer-inspired battles that have taken place in or around the bar.    There are no major problems in the cleanliness of the bar or the restrooms...though I am sure when the place gets busy, the clean factor probably takes a hit.  The prices are on par with most other offerings around the area...and Karaoke Saturday is on my list as a \"should attend\".  More as I visit again.",

    "text": "My new FAVORITE spot in the Sun City. This is a friendly neighborhood spot with some excellent bar food. I had wings 3-ways. Go figure. This is like going to your brother-in-law's backyard & drinking cold beer. Then he says hey, I experimenting with wings as a gift to you.  He proceeds to blacken some amazing chicken appendages & then grills some. Just for you. Because he loves your sister- he owes you.  And he makes it up to you by serving you some fantastic grilled, traditional & blackened wings. Oh and he has a deep fryer & makes fried zucchini & fresh cut fries. Maybe he's hoping you have a heart attack right there. You don't care, it's heaven. BTW - he's bringing you ice cold beer before your glass ever gets empty. But you realize it's no backyard dream - it's real.  Here's where it gets really great. The beautiful ladies at Monkey Pants are the most charming & friendly folks you'll find. Melanie & Sarah - I'm talking about you!  Thanks for a great nite!  Epic.",

The drinks are affordable and they have some great food specials as well. We had some hot chili dogs and fries for $4. They also have a goldfish race. Pretty entertaining. Name a fish and squirt at it hoping he gets to the other side of the track (a downspout cut in half and filled with water) fastest. Winner gets a $20 bar tab - cool. They have pool and darts and a big round bar. It's a fun dive bar, I enjoyed it and will be back.",

    "text": "Just what we were looking for! We had a long weekend of business that couldn't be avoided. We had already missed all of the Saturday playoffs games. On Sunday we needed something in proximity to the airport. We are always looking for a place to watch games, not just a place that calls themselves a \"sports bar\". Monkey Pants has the kind of set up I would expect out of an establishment that encourages watching sports. They have dozens of TVs and they even played sound on the games instead of music. My kind of place. The decor is fun and funky. When you come out from the bathrooms there are cassette tapes attached to the walls. Probably easy to overlook, but I thought it was a cool touch. Great service too. Wings are two thumbs up!!!",

    "text": "This bar has quickly become my go-to since it's like, a 5 minute walk from my house..I can just stumble on home if I've had a few too many.   This place is really divey, and the decor is pretty comical. Pictures of teddy bears doing sports on one wall and portraits of naked ladies on the other...The vibe of the place is VERY fun. There's plenty of seating and they have a section where there's a stage for comedy and karaoke nights. And.. get this! They have GAMES! There's always something going on every night. I think they also do a night called Fancy Pants? I've been there once..not too sure it's a regular thing.  The drinks and food are great here. I can't speak for Burgers Across America (since I don't eat meat), but I've had plenty of things here..the cheese curds (omg delicious), veggie wrap and grilled cheese. Yum!   I have witnessed the 1am shirtless shots. What I have not seen are many ladies partaking in it. It's usually a lot of guys...haha.   Service is usually pretty prompt unless they are super busy. The staff is super friendly. Overall, I've never had a bad experience and I've been here several times.",
