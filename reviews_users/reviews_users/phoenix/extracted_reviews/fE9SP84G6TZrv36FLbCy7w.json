    "text": "I am a little surprised by the low average for this place. In its current incarnation it is a modern American restraint that still carries an interesting interior vibe from the late 80s when the place was built. Architecturally unique, it has a dark, modern feel with some warm copper and wood touches.   The menu rotates and is a single page, but there is something for everyone on there. Presentation is modern but moderately enough to remain appealing to the masses. The current chef has mastered the savory / sweet options, which is highlighted by the chicken donuts appetizer. Everyone on our group enjoyed their meals and from the the different entrees I was able to sample it was unquestionable why.  What really impressed me was the service. We had a very large table (I think 16) right around the beginning of their dinner rush on a Friday night and they did a fantastic job with keeping up with drinks as well as helping people of various levels of culinary experience choose their meals. Most impressively, they were able to get everyone's meal out very close together in time (took about 3-4 minutes to get everyone's entrees on the table) which is nearly an impossible feat with a table that large.   The mixed drinks are a bit pricey but this isn't a cheap spot, so I am not going to dock them rating for that. Overall a great experience!",

The food was a bit bland, the breakfast options (which are my favorite at a buffet) were lacking, and the only waffle I could get my hands on was a mini waffle about the size of the palm of my hand (sad face). However, what I DID like about the buffet was endless mimosas - they just refilled my glass without me asking about 4 times... it was great - and this chicken donut thingy that was made to order by the omelet station. It was heavenly and I should have just gotten 17 of those.  I will also say that the hostesses on staff that day were so incredibly sweet! They got us a mimosa while we waited for our table to get cleared, which was completely unnecessary but very welcome. The gentleman serving the prime rib was also extraordinarily nice! Overall, service was great and everyone was very accommodating.  From what I hear, their normal food options are pretty darn good, so don't make a judgement on this place til you've tried that, I'm just saying it's probably not the best place for a holiday brunch.",

It's apart of the Marriott hotel. The decor is rustic but modern. Happy hour is from 5-7p and I didn't notice a dress code policy. For happy hour, we arrived at 501pm and were asked if we wanted to be seated inside or outside. Of course we chose outside! For the regular dinner menu, you may want to make a reservation on OpenTable. The Happy Hour menu has a few small bites (street tacos are $6 and you get two minis) so we did a little taste test. The flavors! I enjoyed every single bite. The chicken donuts were very interesting, sweet and savory, and I wish somewhere in Chicago made that dish! I enjoyed the Sonoran tea as well. We didn't get to stay for the sunset but maybe next time",

    "text": "We were guests at the Tempe Buttes and decided to take in the full resort experience by dining at Top of the Rock.  I was able to make a reservation through Open Table (yay!) and added a simple request of a table with a view.  They were happy to accommodate us and we got a wonderful table right next to the NW facing windows.  TOR purchases locally for their ingredients and also gives a portion of the sales of specific items to local charities.  This place gets it.  The food itself was 5 stars. It was amazing to see what came out of such a small kitchen.  We started with the Savory Chicken Doughnuts which were awesome, the perfect blend of sweet, savory, creamy, and heat.  I am not a fan of jalapenos at all but the Jalapeno Cream Cheese really made the dish.  I ordered the Seared Scallops and The Boy ordered the beef tenderloin.  We also ordered a side of the AZ mushrooms.  Both our entrees were great, the steak was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor it didn't need the house made steak sauce.  Service was a bit slow from the kitchen.  Our entire dining experience took 2+ hrs.  We were sent home with house made truffles which was a nice surprise.   Service was more of a 2 of 5.  Our server was polite and knowledgeable but only stopped at our table to take our orders and deliver food, otherwise she was MIA.  She was quick to recommend the more expensive items on the menu.  I asked about a rose on the wine list and she said she didn't recommend it.  She asked what type of wines I like and I was able to say two words, \"White\" and \"Bright\", before she immediately offered a white blend that was $14 a glass.  She was kind enough to get me a taste first and it was too sweet.  She recommended a different wine which again, was $14.  So far she has recommended 2 of the 3 most expensive wines on a menu where 70% of wines by the glass are less than $12.  Later when I was asking about entrees I gave 3 that I was mulling over, of course she recommended the most expensive one again.  Sigh.  Jokes on her. I ordered one glass of the $14 wine but would have ordered 2 glasses of a $10-12 wine.  Sometimes the up sell doesn't work in the end.",

We started with the the Arizona mule, served in copper mugs of course. They were delicious and had all the right balance of flavors, so they sang in harmony rather than trying to out sing one another.   For app, we had the chicken donuts. Not what I was expecting, but this is where the flavor party started. Yummy, dough, lightly fried, topped with pulled dark meat chicken, with spicy peppers and jalapeno cream cheese. When combined, my tongue danced!  So delicious. And the right portion size too.   Dinner was the best burger I have had in a while. The TOR is sirloin with tomato, bacon jam on a homemade roll. I added sliced avocado in mine and that took it to the top!  I thought the home fries with bacon fat would be delightful, but they were disappointing. But I didn't need them. The burger dominated my chew.   The service was great. We had a lovely lady who took very good care of us.   Oh, and the view is not so bad either.",

My free beer was their citrus beer. They had a very limited selection of draft, so I tried something new. Big mistake. It tasted like they squeezed a lemon into a glass of PBR. It was the first time I ever watered down my own beer to finish it.   Food was decent, but over priced and over fancy. The B3 Burger was decent, but at $17 (oh, you want fries with that? $3 more please for about a cup of fries.) it wasn't worth it. The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their food though.   Service was terrible. Except the guy filling waters and cleaning plates. He was on point, and was the only saving grace. I had to order my beer twice. We had to ask for ketchup twice. Even then, the ketchup came after we all but finished our burgers and fries.   Bottom line: if you want a drink with a view, this is your place. If you want to eat good food, go elsewhere.",

The comp bread arrived at the same time as our meal, only after the severed said it was coming 3 times earlier. We ordered the a Filet Mignon. The steak was cooked well, but the server never asked if we wanted the miso butter or the house steak spice. It I guess defaulted and came with the miso butter, while it was tasty it was a bit too much miso making it heavy on the salt flavor. I had to ask for a steak knife as it didn't come with one. I also ordered the side marble potatoes; there where a lot in a bowel. I guess $8 worth. There where really a lot. They where ok and a bit salty. They steak and potatoes lacked in presentation; just the filet plopped in the middle of the plate with a bowel of potatoes next to it on the plate. We also ordered Wagyo Smoked Short Ribs. The presentation was a bit better here, but for a composed plate it lacked a starch. In fact there was a large space on the plate. It just looked funny. The rib meat was good and the carrots where too. There where very little in the way of vegetable options with the dinners or as sides. We then ordered a creme brulee cheese cake, The presentation was horrible. It didn't even look like a desert. It came with soup spoons not a desert spoon. Also the combination pistachio, berry, chiffon & cinnamon was odd. The pistachio paste was rock hard. The chiffon was burnt. A very poor desert. We didn't even finish it. The wine selection was just the standard CA wine that you can buy at Frys. As many others have said this place does not warrant the price and why ask if your reservation is for a special occasion if you are not going to do anything about it. Several near by tables had a special desert so maybe this was just the servers fail.",

The trout was prepared correctly and had good flavor, but the goat cheese in the grits didn't seem like a good mix.   The dessert wasn't good, the gelato was average and the chocolate looked like an upside down cupcake with a drizzle on top.   The cake was so dense and heavy, it just wasn't that appealing.   The wife had a salmon dinner which was also pretty average.   Go for the views and ambiance, the service will be great but don't expect to be blown away by the food.",

We dined on a Sunday night when the restaurant was almost completely empty (there were only 7 couples the entire night, including us) and were seated far away from the window and any chance of a view.  Perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeling less than excited about work, as service was mediocre at best.  My husband ordered the beef short ribs, which was a fairly decent dish.  Unfortunately, I ordered the pork tenderloin.  The pork was so salty that I couldn't even finish it, and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensured it remained mostly untouched on my dish.  We left without a single goodbye, feeling as unappreciated upon exit as we did upon arrival.  If you're looking for a nice dinner, save your money and go to Kai or Ko'Sin at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Hotel!",

We remembered it being good and the view to be fabulous...and we were not disappointed once again. We were seated immediately and our server (Rod) was friendly and had a good sense of humor. He was thrilled we were there for Restaurant week (good start!)  My husband started with the seared Ahi and I had the Gnocchi. Both tasted fabulous and the presentation was lovely! Our main courses (he had lamb, I had salmon) were also terrific. My salmon was perfectly cooked with an interesting chutney like topping and asparagus. Yum. And for desert we had bananas foster and the molten lava chocolate cake! Now THIS was a fabulous menu and so worth the price! Obviously Top of the Rock was showcasing their wares and wanted us to come back! And we will!",

    "text": "Top of the Rock was not at all worth the price.  The dinners were awful.  The $24 Roasted Chicken was very boney and undercooked along with undercooked asparagus.  The mashed potatoes tasted like KFC potatoes.  The $28 Baja Scallops were, hands down, the worst scallops that I've ever eaten.  They were burned black on top and not even quite lightly brown on the bottom.  It was obvious that they were left to burn in a pan of fried onions.  They were burned very badly along with the onions which were like charcoal.  The lighting was so dim that it was not obvious until we began eating as to how terribly bad dinner was prepared.  I, at first, thought it was just a very dark sauce on top of the scallops and on the plate.  When I chewed the scallops it was like chewing a sandy grit...disgusting.  I missed lunch that day so I was very hungry.  I trimmed my way through 3 out of the 4 scallops before the server stopped to ask if we needed anything more.  I questioned the server about how dark the scallops were and she stated that they are not usually that dark.  My thought...Then why serve them?  The chef should have been ashamed to send out scallops like these.  I passed on a discount since I was using a Groupon but I later regretted that decision since the food was so awful.  I take comfort in knowing that I will never return to Top of the Rock.  Early on I was looking forward to dessert because we discussed the dessert choices with the server before we even ordered dinner.  We passed on the dessert though only because the dinners were so bad; and I never pass on a dessert.  The only edible item was the $10 Mushroom Soup but don't expect much more than four or five slices of mushroom, it was mainly cream of mushroom.  I recommend skipping Top of the Rock since there are many more fine quality restaurants in the Valley which are worth their prices.",

Not many people were there when we ordered our appetizer and main dish.  Why was the service so slow and our food arrived cold?  The main course was also barely warm.  My friend ordered hers well done, it was almost raw.  The green beans were cold and crunchy, not really steamed enough.  I had called the restaurant ahead of time to find out if the steaks were preseasoned because my husband can't eat anything spicy.  He doesn't like pepper.  I was told that he can have it the way he wants.  We told the waitress no pepper, nothing really spicy on the steak or on anyhing else.  My husband was so hungry by the time we finally got our food that he ended up eating peppery food.  An upset stomach came later.  WE HAVE LIVED OVERSEAS AND HAVE TRAVELED TO OVER 20 COUNTRIES.  WE HAVE DINED AT MANY FINE RESTAURANTS. TOP OF THE ROCK IS OVER RATED.  We have dined at casual placed better than this.  The manager didn't charge us for one dinner and two sides.  So, on my birthday, I was fortunate to be with friends and have a nice view  BUT next time I'll go some where else!  There's many restaurants with great views.",

A bit slow on the service, but very friendly: my glass of water always full, bread constantly and my wine refilled without asking.  The ambience is very nice and would work great for a romantic dinner, but also for a group meeting.  The food was ok.  The menu had a lot of variety and  the description of each meal promised a succulent experience but when I tasted it the blend of the flavors was quite not there.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was well cooked, the fish was nice...it is just that I could not detect well the interesting combination of flavors that I saw described.  The portions were nice and you certainly feel satisfied when you are done with your courses.  I love a quiet restaurant where you can enjoy conversation while you eat: definitively I was able to do that in addition of enjoying a wonderful view.  My only other complaint is the parking...this restaurant is part of the Marriott resort and valet is the only option.  On Friday night they only had one person to take care of the valet for the hotel and the restaurant (which was surprising) so, of course, I had to wait a good 10 minutes to get my car taken when I arrived and another 5-10 when I left.  Finally, the restaurant has a nice bar downstairs from which you also can enjoy the view.  It has a pool table so it looks like a great place to hang out with friends.",

That said, and although the service was excellent, the food was just ok.  It's a nice place for sure and I'd probably dine in again but for the views, the ambiance and a burger.  Can't mess up a burger can you?  ;).",

The bar area is small, but there weren't a lot of people in it, so it worked out fine.  There is outdoor dining, but it was too hot outside.  My friends ordered from the Happy Hour Menu, and I ordered from the regular menu.  All of the food was excellent as well as beautifully presented.  I got the BLT Salad (avocados, heirloom tomatoes, feta cheese tossed in a vinaigrette dressing).  It was topped with two strips of tempura fried bacon!  WOW--just WOW!  Gorgeous, not to mention delicious!  My friends got the HH sliders, chicken tacos, house made potato chips, and deviled eggs.  We were also served bread and corn muffins with a spicy butter--So good!  Service was impeccable!   Nice evening with a great view!",

We actually pass this restaurant on the I-10 quite often and we would have never thought the view would be amazing. I actually don't remember the food all that much but the atmosphere was great.  If the weather is nice out they'll allow outdoor dining but I'm sure with a little coaxing the Maitre d' will turn on the heaters and fire pit for you. Bring a coat/jacket/sweater in case. The service was amazing and the waiters were very helpful.   Sunset is obviously the best time to go. During colder months I would suggest going in an hour before just so you're not stuck in the cold weather. You will be treated to the bright lights of Phoenix and the airplanes that go in and out of Phoenix International Airport. But don't worry you don't hear any noise from the airport or the nearby freeway.  The wedding reception followed a beautiful ceremony that took place below the restaurant near the pool/waterfall. I think they fit about 200 guests in the entire restaurant. The appetizers were decent and the buffet was typical nothing out of this world.  I would definitely rank this one of Phoenix's best restaurants with a view. Perfect for any romantic dinner or social event.",

    "text": "I knew how expensive this place was before we made reservations so based off of other reviews and their prices we figured that it'd be worth the money.  The server was fine however I ordered my steak medium and it was served to me rare.  I ate one piece because I didn't want to complain however I couldn't stomach it and I didn't like the texture so I said something to the waiter.  He took it back to the kitchen and they threw away the pieces of the steak that I already cut up and recooked the rest.  When this type of stuff happens you're supposed to get a whole new steak because at that point by putting it back on the grill they sacrificed the integrity and quality of the steak.  When my steak was brought back to me it still was a little under cooked,I ended up eating two more bites and taking the rest home for my dogs to eat.  I wasn't even offered a small discount and when spending $150.00 easy for a meal that I was expecting to be above par I would assume an establishment such as this would try to make it right.  As sad as this sounds I would have enjoyed Texas Road House more than this place.  I would recommend saving your $ because the amount that you're going to spend isn't worth the view or the experience.",

Each item of food that I tried (and I tried just about all of them) was exceptional. Usually at an all you can eat thing, there's a few letdowns, but there weren't any at Top of The Rock.   The scenery was absolutely brilliant. If the weather permits, sit on the patio, and enjoy one of the most fantastic views in The Valley.  The service was *stellar*. Our waitress (I think her name was.. Jamie?) was one of the best I've ever had. So was the turkey, and all the other stuff! The sushi was great too, and put many restaurants which specialize in sushi to shame. The desserts were almost too adorable to eat. I'm pretty sure I tried about 6 of the various custards, creme brulees, tarts, and mousses. The desserts are made in house, by one obviously amazingly talented pastry chef. Typically such desserts taste kinda.. soapy, and trucked in... absolutely *not* the case here. The flavors, caramels sauces and everything else were exquisite, and again that applies to the main dishes, and sides served. No corners were cut, and I am going to be smiling for days. I can't wait to return to Top of The Rock for more fantastic experiences in the future.",

    "text": "It's okay.  I remember a time where top of the rocks menu and restaurant in general could compete with others such as Durrant's or capital Grille or the compass room... Not anymore.  23$-45$ main course of steak and fish, very reasonable but nothing fantastic anymore..  They just change their menu this past Wednesday and I have to say that I'm not impressed. I frequent this place a lot with my bosses and fellow employees. They have a nice upscale setting but allow for the casual dress. The cocktails I have to say are really good but with the new menu has not been that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgreat.my&s=109047f7af0246e7b3b38f47df81e7426b333b75d37dc6b7004597e383b31748\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">great.my</a> boyfriend had the 16 ounce ribeye last night and that was completely worth it the way that it was crispy on the outside and the perfect rare pink on the inside was great and the seasoning was great but the side dishes are something less than to be desired. Almost raw green beans, three very little new potatoes, one small round russet potato is your \"scalloped potatoes\", crunchy the polentas or Kinwall, and the only thing that comes with fries is the burger.  The way that they've paired up their sides in their main courses makes you want to order the main course but then ask for a completely different side dishes that are meant to be with other main courses.  by far though the only side dish that we enjoyed was the housemaid fries with a side of the jalapeno aoli sauce.mind you the sauce is with a different dish and the fries are with the different dish. I suggest looking at the whole menu and then asking them to substitute sides. I'm not quite sure what they were thinking when they paired up these sides. The main dishes of either chicken fish or steak are really good but as I said the side dishes really aren't that great. The way they serve their bread now as well with one small piece of cornbread and two little slices of French bread is a little ridiculous to. The portions are a lot smaller. But there are a agave honey butter that comes with the bread is very good. Also the fact that they only offer a split pea soup that isn't even that great but only if you get the three-course meal is elect out as well. I just have to say I don't like this new menu and it needs some more tweaking.  Also. The way that they serve there pork belly are too large squares with a little bit of sauce seared on the outside. One of my favorite things to order everywhere is pork belly. My two favorite places that have it right now our grass roots kitchen tap andHouse of tricks. It's also very hard to screw it up. But last night they manage to have my pork belly come out ice cold in the middle.when I sent it back and they made me a new one this time it came sliced in the slivers with the crispy outside layer and the raw pork belly on the inside slightly warm. It was much better but it just wasn't a really good cut of pork belly. It also ruined my appetite a little bit after biting into a big chunk of pork belly that was ice cold in the middle. But my boyfriend steak was really amazing.   With the weather being the way it is definitely asked to sit outside it has a great view if they would cut back the sum of the shrubbery just about every table would have a great view but unfortunately they have trees covering a lot of the view of the city you could have sitting outside. I grew up in Tempe so I am very familiar with this restaurants and have worked next to it for a long time. I just remember it used to be more upscale and through the years it's become more mediocre. More like just another restaurant attached to a hotel. They really need to bring back some of the good more hearty filling side dishes.   The service was good but you do get a lot better service being inside then you do outside. For example after I was given my pork belly and I bit into it and it was ice cold I needed to grab a waiter that was coming out bringing a check for another table to have them take it back because I hadn't seen my waitress. She was very nice and very knowledgeable about the new menu but I noticed that all the servers for the outside which there were three different servers for 8 tables outside, was slow.  If you don't like something and you're sitting outside I would highly suggest trying to taste it before your waiter waitress disappears.",

But, as it turned out, the sunset paled to the food that Chef Gregory Wiener served us that night. We were in for treat after treat right from the beginning with appetizers of Savory Chicken Waffles and Salmon Rillette. We shared everything because it was so good we al wanted to share. I have to say, he turned me into a salmon lover. This from someone that doesn't like fish! The roasted Bone Marrow was so delicious I had resist the temptation to just pick up the bone & save it for myself. When the Green Chilli Goat Pot Roast came out I was reluctant to try it. I shouldn't have been! It was fantastic! Our guest polished off every smidge of his Pork Temple, while the rest of us took leftovers home of Simple Roasted Chicken and Double Cut Pork Chop. The servings were generous and all the meat was incredibly juicy and full of flavor. Not only that, the presentations were beautiful. Desserts were equally as enticing. Service was impeccable. The wine list is excellent with choices to fit every budget. A visit from the Chef mid dinner made the night just that more special. I cannot understand why every table in the place wasn't full...it should be every night! This restaurant is deserving of your patronage. You won't regret it!",

I really liked this place the view was amazing and valet was free.  This being said yes it's pricey but you get what you pay for and that's local ingredients.  Their concept now supports local farms and farms in California that are organic.    I had a glass of Louis Martini Cab to go with my meal and it was wonderful.  I ordered the pork belly and was a little hesitant because it was combined with pear and I wasn't sure that would go well together.  I was very glad my server recommended it because it was some of the best pork belly I've ever had.    Our server Laura Carrol was very nice and always on top of our needs.  She made the dining experience top notch.  She was also very knowledgeable of the menu and if she didn't know the answer she went to ask the chef.    I will totally come back and I will again look for a groupon because it helps on the hit to the wallet.",

The menu is not too large and no offerings for vegans. But, if you like surf and turf, they you are at the right place. Enjoy the sunset, view of camelback mountain, papago bluffs, and planes coming in on their approach to sky harbor airport.  The service was very good, the food was also pretty good (I ordered the ribeye) and the atmosphere and view amazing.  Enjoy.",

After reading a few reviews i picks this place. GREAT choice food, atmosphere, staff and overall experience was fabulous. We had a beautiful view of the rolling hills, and veiws of mesa, tempe and planes flying in. The waitress was very knowledgeable on all the items and questions we had. She was very pleasant, and seemed happy to be able to work with and for us. My wife ordered the  chicken and featherling potatoes with a quickly fried side of greens. She loved them, and I had the steak pasta. Both dishes were better than expected and after dinner there was a complimentary dessert. Chocolate cake. If you are looking for a place that will be memorable and has great food. This is the place. Next time im in the area I WILL be in my favorite restaurant for the setting of the sun. Thanks for making our day so special.",

    "text": "We came here with a groupon, which I'm glad because the food was definitely over priced. It wasn't bad, but, I expected more. I ordered the scallops, which were $28. They came with a sauce made of amaranth, beets, and I can't remember the rest. Anyway, on the menu it sounded like the sauce was a side dish, not a sauce. So I was a little surprised when only three very large sea scallops were brought out to me on a plate and nothing else. I mean, for 28 bucks, at least give me a veggie on the side!   My husbands dish was the same. He ordered the pork belly, and the discription on the menu was also for a sauce, and not a side dish (his was some kale sauce). Both dishes were good, the scallops were not over or undercooked; the pork belly had a very nice bbq sauce on it, but, still, for that price tag, I feel we got gypped, even with the groupon. (the pork was 26)   On a different note, the service was great, and the view was superb. You can see almost all of phx from that spot! Absolutely breath-taking. Is the view worth paying so much for the food? Not in my humble opinion. I think there are plenty of high dollar places out there (if one wants to spend boucoup bucks on food) that will actually give you a better run for your money......(Feast, in Tucson, for example)",

A bunch of us parents were looking for a place to celebrate after a Saturday afternoon high school athletic event. One of the group suggested Top of the Rock. We got there right at 3pm when they were opening up. We were warmly greeted and we elected to sit outside to take in the marvelous view.  Peter learned of our being there and that we were celebrating. He saw to it that we were very well looked after and that our experience was everything WE wanted it to be.  With so many places to go to in the valley, Peter, his staff and the Top of the Rock are making every effort to be known as the place to go. I will not being going anywhere else.   Thank you so much for adding to a memorable afternoon.",

    "text": "This place has the best view of anywhere in the Valley.  Words don't do it justice - we were lucky enough to show up for our reservation as a massive storm was rolling from the East Valley towards Phoenix, the sky divided.  Wow.  The inside of the place is nice, too.  Very date-y kinda place all around.  With such a gorgeous setting, I wouldn't have been surprised if the place slacked on food.  Such was not the case.  Top of the Rock makes a real effort to use locally sourced products, from the produce to the cheese to the beer, which is always a good sign.  We started with a shrimp dish.  Almost everything about the dish was great - housemade gnocchi, local sausage, figs, a subtle honey-lime sauce.  Sadly, the shrimp didn't live up to the rest of the dish.  It was overcooked and rubbery.  Still enjoyable!  The highlight of the night was the salmon dish, served over quinoa.  Some of the best salmon I've had.  In stark contrast to the shrimp, it was simply prepared, tender, and moist.  The only complete letdown of the night was the vegetables.  Having been lucky enough to go to Noca a few weeks earlier, we'd just had perfectly prepared seasonal roasted vegetables that provide a perfect counterargument to people who think a plate full of veggies need be bland or boring.  This was the opposite - blandly prepared vegetables in a buttery-tasting sauce that didn't really justify the price tag.  Top of the Rock is a great place for a cocktail, some nosh, and would be a great start to a romantic night on the town.",

    "text": "For the flagship restaurant of a Marriott Resort, I would expect a higher caliber cuisine. On the plus side, the service was friendly, professional, and even above average on the two subsequent nights we dined here. The first night, we began with the guacamole appetizer which I would say is one of the best I've ever had! Maybe it was the tequila, lime juice, or hot pepper that went in to it, but bravo! ON the second night, we ordered it again, only to be served a completely different flavor -- this one bland and devoid of whatever made it zing the first time. The server informed us they make it different each night, depending on the cooks. That's puzzling that there is not a more consistent approach or recipe. Highly recommend standardizing on whoever made it the first time.  Moving to the main menu, my colleagues and I were anticipating great things and had a very hard time choosing between a few of the more creative entrees that sounded most appealing. We were served small proteins and poorly prepared starches, arranged in confused platings that were more a mash-up than an arrangement. The risotto was probably the biggest disappointment, as that side was not even worthy of the name risotto.  We were compelled to give it a second shot on the second night at the hotel, and this was more of a three-star experience. We stayed simple on our ordering: burger + avocado + egg and grilled salmon. The burger was amazing as were the fries, but ruined by a somewhat stale and bland bun.  I think this place has a lot of potential, but consistently the food we tried had one aspect of it that kind of ruined the experience. I would suggest focusing in on polishing the plates, the ingredients, and truly making this restaurant as great as the service.",

We ordered a cheese plate that was pretty good, but nothing special.  We also got a mini pot pie that I must say was delicious.  The service was decent, but not particularly great.

As me and my wife arrived without reservations we asked for a table near a window for a view and they said they're none available  due to reservations but there were several tables available and they were never filled for our entire dining. Not to mentioned it was a hour before closing... But we were put in booth without a view. Also my wife who is Vegetarian had little options from menu besides salads... To think such a fine dining would offer other options WRONG!  So we were told ahead of time to order the salmon plate without the salmon and they would lower the price since the salmon is the main part of the dish.  The plate cost $29 But when the bill came we were being charged full price and had to let the server know and he had the nerve to say let me see what I can do since the chef added more vegetables (as if adding a couple extra vegetables is the same value as fish). The end result to that was him only deducting $6 lol wow! So then my meal I chose chicken and biscuits wow so bland no flavor and basically they gave me a small corner of a actual chicken breast I couldn't believe my eyes!!!!!! I don't recommended this place!!!!! Save your money and for cheap buy cheaper food and drive up south mountain and trust ull feel u had a more amazing time then this place!!!!!!!!!",

The Salmon was raw, my steak was tough. When they took the fish back they just brought out the same fish, just put it back in the pan and made it like rubber. The Cook in the back, I say cook, because no way a proper Chief would have sent that food out, He saw I was trying to get someone to come over. He pointed to the MGR and he looked at me, the MGR took two steps, then turned around and found our waitress and made her walk over. This place is Awful. This is a MGT issue. One guy walked over at the end and asked me how things were. I said I had a list of things that went wrong. He said, He did not want to hear them all. OMG. Im checking out of the hotel tomorrow. Never to come back. Sorry Marriott, This place does not meet your standers.",

We've been wanting to try this restaurant out and it happened to be part of restaurant week so it was perfect timing.   We had the chicken and doughnuts as a starter, which was phenomenal and plenty of chicken and flavors. We also had buttered bread which was lamb liver. I wasn't too much of a fan, but my boyfriend loved it. It came with French fries which was a bit weird, but maybe they did that for restaurant week only.  For the entree I had the Arctic Char fish wish was so perfectly and melted in my mouth. They was a little bit too much of the soy sauce on the plate, but other than that I'd order it again. My boyfriend had the wagu flat iron and enjoyed it as well.  As for the dessert, it was enjoyable as well. The glazed banana chocolate mouse cake with ice cream was delish and I had the mousse.   Lastly, the view. Spectacular. We sat outside and had a romantic dinner on the patio to ourselves, before other people got there as we finished. Highly recommend, not only for the view but the experience and the quality of the food as well.",

Dirty table,  the windows we were looking out of to see The View were dirty and had fingerprints. Food was not up to par. For a $40 steak I could have gotten better at Charlestons. The desert tasted like a very old twinkie...hard and no flavor. Was not thrilled at all. Looking around the room it seemed as though everyone working there was on their cell phone or standing around talking. Nobody looked interested in being there.  Won't go back ever!!  However, if you do go I'd recommend  the chicken donut appetizer. This is the only thing this place has going for it.  The architecture on the inside is pretty cool.",

He had the halibut as the main and enjoyed it while I had the ribeye with al la cart asparagus.  We both had tea.   I don't know if I enjoyed our server Christine more ; she was really knowledgeable about the menu and professional while still being laid back and fun,  or the carmel desert more.  It was so good it made me blush.  It's tough to choose because both the service and the dessert were the best we've ever had.   In the name of honesty the downside would have to be the chairs.  We were in a comfy high back booth, but they reminded me of 80's cafeteria chairs.  I think the view and the interesting architecture made up for it though.   Dress is resort casual, even on a Friday night.  Dinner totalled about $140.00 which I feel was fair.",

We were there for the Restaurant Week menu. The Ceviche was good along with the over cooked Pork Belly, the Braised Short Rib was very good but the NY Strip was not so good.

The breaking was light and not too oily and actual popcorn in it with a tossed sprout mix. Very clever. Lori is GF so the chef actually made an off the menu amuse Boucher of goat cheese and beets which she said was very good. I don't like beets so I'll defer to her. It was however very thoughtful and that is what counts.   For dinner I had the pork-chop tenderloins bone in with Kale and fingerling potatoes. This dish is huge. Seriously huge and tasted very good. The cream/ mustard dip that accompanies it is just alright.   Lori had the seared scallops and charred broccolini which were topped with cheese crumbles. All in all a great date with a great view and the service was above par.",

The kitchen is fast and the servers are very attentive. They were extra sweet for our anniversary - giving us a free dessert!   Sadly the food is not worth the price. The cesear salad was unimpressive. The clam/mussel hot pot was a sad bowl of broth with a few shells. And the carrot chips served under the short ribs tasted like mashed potatoes.  All that being said: the wagyu beef and the artic char did have great flavors. The BEST DISH was the appetizer ravioli! That needs to be transitioned into an entree!",

    "text": "We went for our first anniversary last weekend and loved it! We went around 7:45 and were seated fairly close to the windows for the spectacular view over Phoenix. The timing was perfect as the sun was down and not in our eyes but the sky was still lit up and gives you a front row seat to the perfect Arizona sunset. It was fairly busy and it died down for a bit but then the 9pm group rolled in as we were leaving. The staff was very kind and checked in on water often which is good. The GM made herself known by checking in and was very nice. The appetizer came quickly, even before our drinks, but that was good because we were getting hungry. However dinner came a little slower...maybe our dish, maybe just got busy but no complaints. We started with blue moon beers and the seasonal ravioli which was bursting with flavor we wouldn't normally try. It was filled with a lemon zest and cheese, topped in a pesto arugula sauce!  The complimentary bread was so good, there's a cheese biscuit and a cinnamon biscuit.  For dinner we shared the halibut which we felt was pretty tasty...but with the dill seasoning it strangely tasted exactly like a glorified cheeseburger. Not a bad thing really but it's so strange! The mashed potato with a fried outside and the asparagus was pretty good but we enjoyed our purchased side of mac n cheese! We were offered a dessert for our anniversary but we waited for quite a while and decided we were ready to rollout so skipped it.  Overall I absolutely can't wait to return and excited to try different menu items in the future.",

    "text": "I'm a bit angry with this place.  I can only afford a nice restaurant once a month,  this month I went here with a couple of friends.  I gotta say,  I was excited,  this place has an incredible view,  but that was it,  that's all they had.  I ordered a ribeye, with mushrooms.  We also got the chicken and donuts that I did enjoy.  It was creative and looked as good as it tasted.  But they seat you at a tiny table over crowded with plates and glasses.  We were constantly moving things around just to navigate around the table.  When the steak arrived,  my mouth watered,  it was a good size,  had great color on the outside,  but inside was not how I ordered it. There was no flavor.  This was not a cheap steak, but I feel I could have done better for half the price. That steak made me angry.  The mushroom were ok, but very small portion.  My friend had an issue with her side and when she brought this to our servers attention,  he did react but blamed the issue on hearing something different.  Anyway he seemed cold and uncaring.  Bad service.  I did not want to bring my issue up, as I knew it would not go well,  so I left it alone.  But I'm saying it here.  Horrible service.  Over priced, Bad experience.   I won't go back.",

I took my husband here for his birthday 06/19, made a reservation and requested for the window seating. When we got there they tried seating us in the center of the room, said that the table they wanted to seat us is still occupied by the same people that's been there earlier....SO WHAT SEAT US AT ANOTHER TABLE BY THE WINDOW IDIOTS!! The service was lousy, the waiter didn't bring out our 2 slices of dinner bread for each person until an hour later. Oh and to top it off he made a comment that tonight will be the last night they will serve this sour dough bread because it cost the restaurant too much money. He said they will start serving biscuits like the ones at Red Lobster, he had just tried it in the kitchen.....HOW UNPROFESSIONAL!! A total of 1 1/2 before we finally got our dinner. Our food was extremely bland, the steaks my daughter ordered was very dry and my husband's was not cooked evenly....requested for med well. Their fries was extremely salty, my husband has high blood pressure so he stopped eating after the first fry. My scallop dish has only 5 pieces on there with very small portion of mash potatoes....did I mentioned it cost me $28 for that dish. Lastly, the stupid waitress came and asked whose birthday is it today when I clearly told them when making reservation that it was my husband's bday and also told the hostess when she sat us at the table.....why not throw the surprise out the window. Then when she brought his bday dessert out, she ask him if he wanted a candle on it.....duh, who would ask someone that question. I called to complain to the manager Peter Juneja, he didn't  seem to care.....figures since we've already paid them. They will never see me step foot in this horrible place again. I hope some of you people read this before going there.....good luck.",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here for Father's Day 2012. Driving into the resort complex and up the winding road was quite lovely, as we arrived at dusk.  However, when we reached the valet stand, no one was there, and after waiting about 10 minutes for an attendant, we parked our own vehicle.    The view was gorgeous, and we were seated in a great location: right by the window overlooking the city.  The restaurant was not very busy and lacked the energy I remembered from my last visit, which was a year ago.  It reminded me of a sleepy ghost town that once bustled with activity but had become dormant.   Our waitress was pleasant, but forgettable: attentive but not especially personable.  We were each given one toasted piece of white bread unannounced after being seated for 15 minutes or so.  I wasn't sure what that was all about....the bread was hard and tough (Olive Garden breadsticks would have been better!). I ordered an heirloom tomato pasta dish, and my man ordered steak.  I was appalled at the contrast in portion sizes.  The pasta I was given could have easily served 3 or four people (Buca di Beppo style), but my boyfriend's steak was small and more like an appetizer than an entree.  After four or five bites, it was gone.  Along with the steak, his entree included a nondescript vegetable assortment that was sprinkled with what appeared to be small cubes of pork (which he does not eat). He was not given a choice of side dish, and for close to $40, I would much rather have (in retrospect) taken him to Donovan's for a hearty New York Strip for $60 or $70. Disappointing (sigh).    As for my pasta, I found the wide egg noodles to be unappealing, reminiscent of tuna noodle casserole.  The tomatoes were baby cherry tomatoes, which were tasty but scant.  The sauce was rather unflavorful and bland.  Buttery, but not garlicky or cheesy.  We skipped dessert altogether.    The view was unparalleled, but I somehow got the sense that the staff relies on it as a crutch to compensate for mediocre food and service.  It would be nice, also, to hear some better music in the background: something more elegant, classy, jazzy... We might need to call Gordon Ramsay for an intervention...this spot has a lot of potential, but needs improvement.   For the money spent, I could have easily raided Whole Foods and cooked up a tasty, substantial meal at home for my man. If you really want an amazing dining experience, excellent food, exceptional service, and a memorable, intimate, romantic atmosphere, go to Donovan's!  It's by far the best restaurant in the Valley!!",

I realized quickly that we shouldn't have eaten here.  Our server was incredibly slow and inattentive to our table the entire night. He did a good job explaining items in the menu, but when they arrived he had definitely over sold them. We started with a few drinks, salads and the charcuterie board. The drinks and side salads were good but the charcuterie was small and oddly paired. The fruit was scarce...the house made jam was minimal and they gave a biscotti type bread instead of bread/crackers/toast, so we paired most of the items with our salad.  We then ordered the chicken and donuts that get good reviews and the waiter raved about. The chicken tasted like it had been in a crockpot for a few days and the donuts in a bag from the grocery store for the same timeframe. It was inedible.   It was all so terrible that we left without eating a main course.  The view was nice but I'm sure there are a number of better options that include a view with your meal in Phoenix.",

The Chicken donuts and Salmon Rillete were yummy, also.   The kids menu offers genuinely delicious food and balances the entrees with vegetables, fried potatoes and bread.   Make a reservation for the outdoor patio around dusk and you'll be rewarded with one of the best places to watch the sunsets in Tempe.",

Started with a signature cocktail, New Fashion, of infused spirits which was quite an adventure.  Very tasty with some spice (ancho chili) to make it jump. Decided on roasted chicken with kale.  What a surprise!  I had seen that they use local suppliers for farm to table freshness.  Well the chicken is amazing!  Roasted perfectly, juicy and the flavor is unbelievable! Quite honestly the best roasted chicken I have eaten in a very long time.  And this is a hotel restaurant! The staff was attentive and responsive.  If I lived in Phoenix I would come here for a great night out regularly.",

Our waitress instructed us to eat it with a bit of donut, a bit of chicken and some of the sauce at once. MMMmmmmm! I was worried that the entree (burger) would not be able to live up to the amazingness of the chicken donuts but was pleasantly surprised. It was cooked perfectly and was super tasty. The bacon jam is gorgeous. Our server (Christina I think?) was amazing and the view of the valley is a beaut. Definitely will be back!",

    "text": "The Short- Great food. Love the use of local ingredients like Noble Bread and Danzeisen  Dairy. Price is right for the portions and quality.  Lovely view and good service.  Read further for more details.  PS- I plan on coming back for happy hour when a 3 course meal isn't in the budget.  The Long:  I have had this place bookmarked for a while, and with AZ Restaurant Week, we decided to check it out (Ask for the menu, it wasn't automatically provided or advertised)  Made a Reservation, and were seated by the window.  It was absolutely FREEZING but the waitress did everything she could to turn the air vent down, even offering to move us or get a blanket.  Happy Hour is only on the patio and at the bar, but since we were ordering dinner, the waitress let us also pick from the Happy Hour Menu which was fantastic!  I ordered the Manhattan ($14, not on happy hour...so please update your online menu!).  I have definitely had better for less...Husband ordered the Spicy Margarita which was good but small.  There were lots of yummy cocktails to pick from, so maybe next time I'll try something else.  Ordered the Chicken Biscuit (only on HH for $5).  LOVED IT! About the size of a chick-fil-a large sandwich which was unexpected. Hubby ordered the pickled beet and goat cheese toast on the Restaurant Week Menu ($33 bucks for 3 courses)  I would love to see it on the regular menu.    Half way through dinner, we watched a guy proposed to his girlfriend at the next table...how sweet!  I ordered the salmon entree on the regular menu ($25).  The Salmon was perfectly seasoned but the vegetables were a bit under cooked for my liking.  Also, the plating is just weird....so much empty space on the plate didn't make me feel like the portion was enough.  Hubby ordered the pork chop with corn and a fig sauce (AZ Restaurant Week Menu) and it was even better than the salmon.  I wanted to lick the sauce from the plate.  For Dessert, hubby ordered a goat cheesecake with grilled fruit.  I loved it because it was not too sweet.  Since it was on the Restaurant Week menu, the portion was suited for 1 person.  I ordered the Campfire Smores which hotchata marshmallows, which was soooo good ($6) and could easily feed 2-3 people.  The check came with an assortment of chocolate dipped marshmallows...as if we had room!  Check came out to just over $100 total with tax, tip, 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts. Granted we made fair use of the Happy Hour and AZ Restaurant Week menu in addition to the regular menu.",

We had lamb , duck and pork. OMGAD, can I say AMAZING!!!!!!! Seriously wanted so more!!!! Best tacos I ever had in my life and I'm not playing around .   Anyways we then ordered our entree . Fiance had a salmon dish and I had pork chop ! Def say his was better than mine . But my dish was still good! Was worth the money.   Overall our time at \" top of the rock\" was the best I ever had . Check it out sometime if your around Tempe. I would recommend to make reservations through Open Table. Easy & fast ! We'll be back again on a special occasion :) thank you and I hope everyone enjoyed my review .",

We came for AZ Restaurant Week and we were happy to have picked this place out of 100 other locations. The ambience is wonderful, tje service was very attentive, our glasses were never empty, every dish was explained, cutlery was replaced immediately after every course. Our dishes were all simply delightful. It is elaborate cuisine, made to let the ingredients shine. The dishes are all familiar, but all executed to perfection and in a new way. My dessert was surrounded by dry ice and the waiter poured clove scented hibiscus tea on the dry ice, creating a deliciously smelling fog that just completed the dish without actually adding a new flavor to it. Isn't that simply genius?  Again, no complaints about anything, I can highly recommend Top of the Rock, especially now for the AZ Restaurant Week!",

In a soaring, wood beam ceiling, endless windows, fabulous view way.  A time when dining was about atmosphere and grand statements.  We started with happy hour.  A couple of drinks and appetizers.  The sweet, spicy chips and dip were great.  As the sun set we settled in and figured there was nowhere better to spend the evening.  Our server was chatty, fun and informative.  Looking out onto the lights of the evening we enjoyed the bistro steak and burger.  Both cooked to perfection and delicious.  The side of corn on the cob was creatively spiced and caked with voting cheese.  Good, reasonably priced wine by the glass selection.  The Tempranillo was a great accompaniment to the steak.  This place makes for a very special evening.",

But then we waited and waited for our food. Finally we got our food and my roasted duck was on point! Delicious, tender, juicy and just well roasted. But then they forgot about us. We wanted water and a dessert menu. We asked someone to help us and they said they will be right over, 10 minutes later nothing. Finally we just took our cards out and gave it to the next waitress that passed by and just said \"charge it please\". You guys were great until it got busy. I guess they are not use to that.

They are very willing to take opinions of the food, though there wasn't much to complain about.  The bread is really delicious; cheese biscuit, cornbread and a sourdough served with a compound butter of agave and chili. The compound butter is to die for! The sweetness of the agave contrasts perfectly with the chili. The Thai shrimp appetizer is very generous and comes with a veggie spring roll and tons of crispy shrimp in a spicy sweet sauce. The octopus appetizer was really surprising since we didn't think we could get good octopus in Arizona. It was on the small side for two people but still very good.  The heirloom tomato salad is really refreshing and simple. The TOR salad has an amazing herb vinaigrette and is a shareable size.  The Arctic char was amazing; it was super crispy in a savory sauce with plenty of veggies. The ribs were fall-apart-tender.  The cocktails were are all perfect too. The habanero cocktails have just the perfect amount of heat. They have a old-fashioned made with brandy that I highly recommend created by Guillermo, our waiter!",

Shared the Alaskan Halibut which was okay; a bit over cooked and sauce was too sweet, but portion was good for price. Would not order again, though.  The bread and wine were delicious.  Views were breathtaking.  Very romantic and relaxing.  After dinner we toured the stunning resort then had a drink outside the hotel lobby lounge. We will return here for drinks and appetizers; it's very comfortable and cozy and we can watch baseball.",

I thought this restaurant would be more upscale because it is listed as dated romantic & classy with dressy attire. The waiter brought me the wrong wine and did not have knowledge of the drinks offered. He had to check the computer to see what the restaurant had. I'd give the food a 6/10 in general. The chicken and donuts were good and very unique. The steak and ravioli were definitely just okay. They did give us a free anniversary dessert which was nice - but the dessert was just okay.",

We ordered a bottle of wine at the beginning of the meal and then after finishing, sat for another 35 min without the server coming to the table with empty glasses. No bread was even offered. BTW It wasn't busy. (Tuesday night)   I spoke with the general manager of the restaurant before walking out, and her only response was \"I'm sorry, I can get you another server...\" This was after informing them we no longer wanted to eat at the restaurant. I told her I'd inform the general manager of the resort and she said \"she didn't care\".   This was by far the worst experience I've had in a while and definitely ruined my girlfriends birthday.",

I stayed at the hotel where the Top of the Rock restaurant is located (Phoenix Marriott Resort Tempe at The Buttes).  I came at night to eat at this restaurant and enjoy the view.  However, the fish was not cooked properly and was raw and squishy inside. I am not normally picky and usually just shut up but in this case I had to return the plate and ask to cook the fish further. Overall, it was not a great meal quality and experience even after the plate came back. I travel for business here a lot but now I am not sure if I will come back to eat here if they can't get a fish to cook right. Good thing I did not try their steak.",

We took one of my wife's church friends here for her birthday; she was amazed! The servers that helped us were friendly, knowledgeable, fun and efficient! I want to send a special thanks to Lisa & Neysa!!! They couldn't have been nicer! They even took some photos of us outside with the city lights in the background!  This restaurant is both elegant and cozy! The interior has unique architecture, lighting and seating arrangements. The food is delicious! I would say this is a fairly regal dining experience! I would suggest dressing-up for your visit: slacks, collared shirt and dress shoes would be the minimum. The prices reflect the elegance and ambiance, and in my opinion, are worth every penny! Check their website for the most current menu offerings and related events.  Lastly, I recommend using the parking valet instead of parking yourself; it's just easier. Bring a couple bucks to tip with - again - worth it!",

Also, it was overpowered with cumin (not on the list of ingredients), could not eat it.  Alaskan Halibut for $41.00.  Okay, good fish is expensive.  Fish was overcooked, the rice was crispy on top, the Saffron Fumet was not good either.  Not worth it for any price.  Ate about half.  Quite frankly I think the fish was frozen not fresh anyway.  Wife had Roasted Chicken.  She said chicken was good, but the celery root puree was terrible and the braised greens on top of the mushy root was inedible.  I was with a large group of family members so did not want to make a stink about the food.  Very disappointed.  Server was very nice (Lisa).",

Food was good but it is pricy - you're paying for the experience and views. Portions were decent which is nice. Kids menu has some awesome options -- you can't really beat $10 for salmon with veggies and fries - it wasn't a huge portion but it should be enough for most kids.   I highly recommend walking around the Marriott property before or afterward if you have an opportunity to because the various pools, waterfalls, desert landscaping and views are truly spectacular!",

We were able to see the city lights below and planes taking off and landing in the distance.  We started the evening with a cranberry mule and grapefruit spritzer to drink. Both drinks were light and refreshing.    For the  appetizer,  L tried the chicken and donuts and J tried the Avocado Napoleon. L enjoyed the pulled chicken, but the donut was on the cooler side and lacking flavor. The donut sat on a bed of jalapeno cream cheese. Overall L said this was an interesting dish. The avocado Napoleon consisted of radish sprouts on top of a layer of  avocado mousse and chevre spread on crunchy toast. J forgot chevre was goats cheese- it definitely had the goat cheese tang. J preferred the complimentary bread and biscuits instead.  Main dishes were Alaskan halibut for L and Risotto for J. The Alaskan halibut was cooked to perfection in a citrus buerre blanc with kamut and Chinese Long beans. J enjoyed the risotto made with vegetable stock. It had crispy arugula, enoki mushrooms and  garlic confit. The risotto was enough for more than one person. Definitely a hearty portion.  Overall the view was the highlight, the food was interesting with nice presentation, but the service didn't  meet expectations. For the end of a holiday weekend with few tables- we expected better. Our finished plates remained on the table even after the next course came. It wasn't horrible, but not great either. We would recommend coming for the view, drinks, and a main dish. Both of us would skip the appetizer next time.",

Unfortunately, the food was very underwhelming! I figured for being a Mariott chain, I would expect better.   The complimentary bread felt like bread out of the bag, it wasn't toasted, the compound butter was hard to spread, and it was just a fail overall. We ordered the 3 course special and I ordered a bistro steak with fingerling potatoes. The 1st course was a deconstructed potato salad. Innovative, but dry. The 2nd course was a BBQ platter that you could've gotten at Famous Dave's ( except gotten more food ). The Bistro Steak came out in 3 medallions. For the price, you'd expect to get the steak whole. The fingerling potatoes were good, but I had to use the table salt and pepper to make them better.  The only reason I could muster up 2 stars is for the view and Amy's attempt at making up for slow service. Could've been an off night, but don't think I'll be making my way back here :-(",

For Valentine's Day-before i thought it would be special to take my wife. I can't think of when i have been more disappointed. The Alaskan Halibut was tasteless and the rice fumet was so hard that you had to pick through it to find what you could eat. Also tasteless. My wife's fillet was very tender, but again tasteless. The side of grilled asparagus was burned on the tips and tasteless. I commented to my wife that maybe they ran out of seasoning in the kitchen. The waiter was also one of the most inattentive i have had in years. We kept having to ask for drink refills for her, had to wait 15 minutes for my wine ... got it after asking another waiter if they could please ask ours for our wine. All in all for $148 it was simply a terrible experience and I ended up having to apologize to my wife for the horrible experience. Don't know what happened to the place since the last time, but I absolutely would never return.  Additional comments posted the next day: I am sick. Like other reviewers mentioned, I believe the Halibut was not cooked in the center and who knows how long it was in the kitchen in that condition. I am having significant intestinal issues and have eaten nothing for 18 hours since that horrible meal. Considering contacting the Dep't of Health.",

    "text": "We dined here on Sunday night with a group of 10. My family was coming from all over for a visit, Spring training and a nice dinner out. The ambiance is wonderful and a very beautiful view of the city and surrounding mountains. If not for that, this may be a one star review. Our server was very friendly and really a pleasure, so no complaints there either. It's the food that was the issue... I got the halibut, as did a few of my family members. Two of ours were COMPLETELY over cooked to the point of where they just left our mouths dry, we couldn't eat them, $40 worth of a dry fish a few asparagus and a little potato thing. My husband got the Ribeye which came with nothing but a few fingerling potatoes. No veggie or anything else. He shared his steak with me, because I couldn't eat my fish without a ton of melted butter on it to make it less dry. His steak was nothing to brag about. I would probably give it a 4 on a scale of 1-10. We had apps, entrees and desserts and the ONLY thing I would recommend (after trying everyone's entrees at the table) is the shrimp appetizer. Needless to say, we won't be going back. Good thing I took pictures of the view...",

We were seated right away ( I love restaurants that honor reservation times) and were in the buffet line moments later. All around us were great views of the Tempe skyline.  Every employee we encountered smiled and asked about our day, happy to bring us whatever we needed or direct us where to find what we were looking for.  The food was plentiful, proper temp and really good.  The Easter Bunny walked around (which was bad news for one little girl who could only scream and cry when she saw the bunny) and visited with all the children in attendance.  Service and food were great - we will be back.",

But, they should just shut it down and start fresh. Shut it down, remodel, and reopen.  We were staying at the hotel here so we wanted to give them some business. We went at happy hour. The server suggested some really good food items actually we ordered about 4 things. They were all really good. The best thing was those Canadian french fries. They were really great! We ordered those on suggustion of our server. Glad we did.  All the food was good , but those were best. It just looks old and dirty and worn out in there. THe Manager was standing around doing nothing the whole time. I thought maybe he should of been more pro active helping the staff. They were not slammed but, you can always help your people. If not why even be out there helping. I hope they fix it up nice again then we will be back. But, for the prices they charge on everything it is just not all that.",

The views of the city are spectacular and although the sunset view is limited, the colors of the skyline once the sun goes down are gorgeous. The appetizer menu is unique but be adventurous and try the squid- it is small plate size but very tasty. The tacos are all good but skip the charcuterie platter- not worth it. Our waiter brought two of his favorite desserts and my favorite was the chocolate decadence. We skipped dinner and did a large variety of appetizers. Definitely a fun place and sit outside to take advantage of the view.",

My roasted duck had a slimy and gummy skin that was not cooked properly and the sherry soaked pearl onions (which I really looked forward too) did not have the alcohol cooked out. Biting into the pearl onion was like taking a pungent shot of hot sherry. As for dessert, I had the vanilla bean flan with a tarragon sphere, which I believed to be a sugar globe with tarragon. It was a very wet bubble of liquid, and I understand what flan is, however this liquid was more like water. No flavor, it popped in a very unappetizing way, and I just wish the menu had described it better. I do wish to come back here, as I loved having my whole family together in this beautiful setting. I just hope next time the food is a little more equivalent to the location.",

They had a cocktail, wine and beer selection. Then we sat down for dinner. We were a bit late to sit down, but didn't feel pressured by the staff at all. Thank you!  We had several appetizers; wings of some kind, I didn't try them but they looked OK. What they call lettuce wraps, they tasted good, but it's not what you are expecting, they are like chicken salad on lettuce, but they were good, and couple salads. For dinner we all ordered different things, I think at least one of everything hit the table. I had the scallops, very yummy! I was very happy. The portions on everything looked a little on the weak side, but I wasn't hungry when I was finished.   Then the desserts..... slightly underwhelming. The only thing I liked was this banana bread with chocolate thing. Soooo good! Everything else was blah.   Other than it being very warm inside we had a good time.  I will for sure recommend them for our next business dinner. Very nice and friendly staff, and the flow of service was perfect!  Thank you!",

    "text": "I think the view is impeccable.   Jury is still out on the food for me.  Starters: Chicken donuts. Ok. Well I am not a huge donut fan. However.. these donuts weren't particularly sweet unless you had some of the miso caramel on the plate. Add these with the chicken and the Jalapeno cream - I'm sold. Very good combination.  Mussels and clams fideo. Just ok - keep in mind fideo is little pieces of pasta - they were good - just nothing spectacular. There was little flavor in the broth so the Spanish Chorizo was probably the highlight of this dish because it was pretty good.   I had the BBQ beef cheeks with local grains, bok choy with chipotle. So I guess I had always heard (maybe too much Bourdain) that beef cheeks were amazing. I really wasn't impressed with them, but I am not sure if that was just the case in this instance, or if I just wouldn't like them that much in general. The chipotle on them was spicy and a little overwhelming and the beef cheeks consistency was gummy and really flavorless. I guess the texture to me wasn't the best and so that is why I am confused as to why these are good in general and it's just probably not my thing. So if you are into beef cheeks - you might really like them. If you're not, it's probably an acquired taste. The local grains had hominy in them, which I really like, so that almost balanced out my disdain for the meat.  We had the smores - and I think everyone else liked them - for me I could pass. I'm not a huge dessert fan, but the last time I was at a restaurant I saw a smore and thought that I really missed out on it. This time.. not so much. The crisphy cinnamon tortillas with the \"goo\" in a cast iron skillet (read: some sort of cocoa mixture with the marshmallows on the top) weren't my favorite. Some regular chocolate would have been better - not something that resembled syrup that didn't taste as good. Or - fudge - or something.  Long story short - I think the view was great, I'm not sure that I would be back.",

    "text": "Everyone is absolutely correct on the view. It is amazing. Our server was Amy and she is very attentive and tells it like it is. But the restaurant needs to up its standards on the food. A LOT! We arrived about an hour earlier than our reservation hoping to enjoy the bar and happy hour. The happy hour was there but no bar. They have a small area which is actually part of the restaurant that they call the \"Lounge\". No Bar, just some tables in front of the kitchen or you can sit outside in the heat. We had a drink before dinner and decided to try the Chicken Donut appetizer that people have suggested on here. It was ok but no big deal. So our \"lounge\" server was also our restaurant server who led us to our table. We should have stayed in the \"lounge\" as our table was at the window with the shades down and about 20 degrees warmer than where we had just been sitting. The view and the temperature was better in the \"lounge\".  Amy brought out the dinner menu and it didn't have a very good selection. We would have appreciated some more seafood options and pasta options. Menu had only two fish options, the trout and the black bass. Not really into trout because of the fine bones so she ordered the black bass. I opted for the $18.00 hamburger that Amy suggested. We also each ordered the house salad for an additional $7.00. Salads came....nothing special. Her black bass arrived a short time later. It looked good and she said it tasted good until she got towards the middle. It was raw. Her veggies were burnt so badly she didn't eat them. Now for my burger. It looked fine and was very well garnished. Took one bite and it tasted very badly burnt. But not meat burnt..... bread burnt! Opened it up and both buns were pitch black and burnt to a crisp on the inside. The cook had to have known they were burnt when he assembled this masterpiece. So I peeled back the buns and ate just the meat, which was ok. By now we just wanted to cut our loses and leave so we paid the $130.00 check plus a $20.00 tip and left vowing to never return to this \"fine dining\" rock in the sky.",

    "text": "Excellent food - the buzz about the chicken donuts is well-deserved. We went to happy hour on one night, and dinner the next evening. At happy hour, the charcuterie board was one of my favourites I have had anywhere. The cheese selections were each quite different from the other and all great. We also liked the selection of house-made pickles around the board. At dinner, we enjoyed the barrel aged cocktails, fried burrata,  and both our entrees. Be aware that the portion sizes for entrees are a bit large for a fine dining establishment (so, save room for dessert). The only misstep for me was the cherry jubilee flourless chocolate cake - the cherry sauce was overpowering and the cake was too dense. The service was exceptional, as was the view and the architecture of the dining room. We had a small error on our bill and it was fixed quickly and without argument. Highly recommend this place for a nice date night or a special occasion, or for tourists like us who want to see Phoenix from a unique vantage point.",

We made a reservation for 9 on a Thursday evening and were surprised to find that we didn't need a reservation at all, the place was empty. Even thought we were nearly the only ones there, dinner, for which we only had one course, took 3 hours. The waitstaff, while not overtly rude, were unattentive and unapologetically uninformed about the menu.   The bright side: the food was great. We ordered a variety of entrees and everyone was very pleased with the quality and presentation of the food.   Three stars is honestly generous for this experience. But at least we all left full and satisfied.",

    "text": "I've taken business associates here to enjoy cocktails and appetizers on the patio as we watched the beautiful desert sunset on many occasions. On February 10, I stopped here on purpose to share the same experience with an out of town friend on her first visit to Phoenix. We were dressed casually as were many of the guests. We approached the host stand and asked if we could order drinks on the patio to watch the sunset. The hostess asked if we were staying in the hotel and I said no, I lived in the area.  She grabbed a couple of menus and clearly slipped the designated Happy Hour menu under the desk. I asked her if it was happy hour and she scoffed and retrieved the menu. (We arrived around 5:30 and happy hour is 5p-7p). She escorted us outside and sat us at the easternmost table. (Note: the sun sets in the west!). The patio has about 12 tables and only 2-3 other tables were occupied at that time. I asked if we could be seated in one of the seats along the western wall so we could watch the sunset. She scoffed again and said it was the manager's decision that Happy Hour patrons had to be seated there where she put us. Rather than cause a scene, we sat down and ordered a couple rounds of drinks. It was a cloudy evening and the sunset was not great that night. I really wish I had challenged her and asked to see the manager. Not only was it embarrassing for my friend and I to be treated like second class patrons, this was not my first visit to the Marriott here. It will be my last! There are plenty of other places in the Phoenix metro area to enjoy a spectacular sunset outdoors with friends. Top of the Rock is not one of them!",

Carrots are at the very bottom of my things I like list but the  Roasted Carrots were great.  Pork chops and trout great.   Highlight though was the Carmel pudding desert.  Not at all what you would expect with 3 different sections.   Don't pass this up.   Our server was Krystina and was sensational.    Best $100 meal I've had in a while.",

It was served with a pesto mayo combo sauce and definitely wasn't fresh. It came with three kind of tator tots that weren't good either, probably frozen from the supermarket and thawed out.

Booked a reservation a month in advance but when we got there our table wasn't ready and we had to wait close to an hour to be seated. Service was painfully slow and portion sizes were ridiculously small. The food was not prepared properly and tasted awful. It was so bad it was comical. We left disappointed and hungry. It's way way way overpriced. Save your money and go somewhere else!!!",

    "text": "I found this lovely place by using Yelp, and I'm highly glad I did. I set up a table the night before using open table, and I'd suggest you do the same! I will break down into sections for easier reading.  Decor/Parking: Now as you pull into the hotel, follow the signs. It's easy, until you try to find parking. The lot right next to the restaurant is meant only for valet. Which I don't understand, if you want me to use your service, don't force us to drive down the hill to the dark parking lot. Besides that, little hiccup, the view is amazing. Once inside, you're surrounded by beautiful glass windows that look out towards downtown Phoenix. I will say the view is something to behold and recommend going right before sundown.    Service: As far as getting a table, I was told reservations were the appropriate thing to do. So, make sure to use open table for this, I don't believe they do phone reservations. The lady at the front was nice and welcoming, and we were sat right away. They lead you past the open kitchen, which as a chef I love. Being able to see every step of your meal being prepared shows confidence in the kitchen staff, so I was immediately at ease. Our waiter was nice and made sure to get to know us. We found out we lived in California not too far from each other, going the extra mile for the special occasion also really made us love it even more.  Food: OMG the food was amazing! We shared an app, and to say it was good would be a disgrace. We had the coconut shrimp with a Thai sauce I believe, and yes! Oh man was it good. Entrees were served alone unless you paid for side dishes. We both shared 2 sides with our mains and were extremely happy with the quantity of food. Dessert was killer as well. We got the seasonal dish, and the cobbler. The chefs really know what they're doing in that kitchen.  Overall: This place really does deserve a lot more credit. I believe they have a great team of passionate people, and I for one will be returning every year. I hope you guys try this menu, and fall in love with the place as we have.",

    "text": "This was a beautiful restaurant especially the outside which has a view of the entire valley. Evenings in the wintertime was a comfortable amount of coolness once the sun went down.   Unfortunately the kitchen was not on today. We waited at least 45 minutes until we got our appetizer. When it did arrive it was a delicious app! There was shredded TEX Mex seasoned chicken on top of a fluffy doughnut on top of cream cheese. We split this three ways and it was plenty.   For dinner I got the ribeye medium rare. They charge steakhouse prices but did not deliver. It was 44 dollars for the a la cart ribeye which was a 16 ounce and boneless. The size was nice but my steak was medium+ instead of medium rare. It was also not a dry aged steak and the water was unsure if it was prime meat. The flavor was that of a typical choice steak which was overcooked. It was disappointing especially for the price.  For desert I had the creme Brule. It took about 50 minutes for our desert to get delivered after we ordered it. The topping was a nice caramelized sugar crust as you would find with typical creme brule. However the custard was sour and not the typical creamy vanilla.  Following the meal the waiter apologized for the delays and comped our appetizers and desserts. That was kind of him and helped to save the meal. Overall three stars for the wonderful view and kind waiter. The kitchen needs a lot of help.",

The women  name was Payton and she gave the best service as host that I've had in the past couple of months. When we arrived the host made us feel comfortable and right at home. Once we were seated the server came and sat us immediately. The server was nice as well but i did wish that the host was our server because we just had a great time with her. The food was great and you guys will be seeing me again in the future . Thank you!!!",

The curry soup of the day was a delicious meal in itself, my wife's Arctic Char was perfectly cooked, my chicken was amazing with the best vegetables I've ever had, and it all ended with a fantastic apple cobbler. Be sure to come after sunset, the view is unbeatable! Five stars tonight! We will return again!",

They didn't start getting busy til after 7pm which is odd because that's when happy hour is over! We had to try the chicken and donuts everyone raved about and it was delicious! I ordered a margarita off of the happy hour menu that I didn't care for much and they replaced it with the pineapple habanero one (soooo good)! My husband and I shared the ribeye and mac n cheese which were both amazing!! Our server, William I think...was great! Very attentive even when they got busy. We'll be back again next time we stay at the Buttes!",

A major plus is that you can watch the airplanes take off in the distance.  Service was good and attention to detail was noticed.  We ordered the chicken and donoughts which sounds like an odd combination but was actually delicious.  We decided to skip dinner due to the high prices but their items did sound amazing: halibut, steak, the usualy fine dining selecitons.  I would dock this place one star due to the high price of the entrees, but will be happy to come back here for a happy hour or after dinner drink to soak in some of the views.",

Everything about the dish was delightful, the next day we were checking out of the hotel and I was slightly sad I wouldn't be able to get a second helping of these tasty morsels. We tried other appetizers too, the Gringo tacos (2) were good but nothing too great about them and the chicken wings were not hot at all which was a nice break from drenched buffalo sauce and had a tangy aftertaste. overall, we were satisfied with our dining experience at top of the rock, I just wished I had more chicken donuts before I left the resort.",

I wanted a 6:30 reservation weeks ago but all they had was 5:30 so we went. The restaurant was almost empty til about 6:45. This is a mainly valet place and we do not like to valet. The parking lot is so far away we were exhausted before even getting there. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable but not very attentive. I ordered the Sonoran Tea cocktail and didn't like it at all. I didn't want to say anything and just left it there, mostly full. Our waiter NEVER noticed and we had a hard time even getting water refills. As well, when they initially filled my water, they spilled a little puddle and never wiped it up. It sat there on the table the entire 2 hours we were there. My husband had the sirloin which was cooked to perfection with a homemade BBQ sauce that was unique. The side of bacon fat fries were very tasty but needed salt. I ordered the steelhead trout with crispy Spanish rice and a side of collard greens. The collard greens side was nothing like it mentioned on the menu but was delicious; a bit bitter and crunchy with sweet cranberries. Trout was cooked to perfection. Overall, the food was delicious and worth the exorbitant prices but the service made it not so great. We waited a long time to be served and for the bill and had empty water glasses and a full cocktail almost the whole time.",

We read the very mixed Yelp reviews and ended up trying it. Service was eh. The drinks were okay. We tried some appetizers and thought the charcuterie board was lacking. It had a few pieces of meat, a couple small pieces of cheese, 1 green grape, 1 red grape, 2 small florets of pickled cauliflower, 2 tiny triangles of toasted bread, 2 pieces of biscotti which seemed random, and a couple dollops of sweet jam and honey. Then the chicken donuts arrived. They sounded delicious and we had high hopes. The donuts tasted like cold donuts from a box topped with old spicy shredded chicken from yesterday's crockpot. We couldn't even eat it. They were very nice and took it off the bill without us even asking. We didn't order an entree because everything to that point seemed overpriced and not very good.",

    "text": "To start off, the location seemed promising but within seconds of reaching the restaurant we knew we were doomed. The valet walked to our car, (WALKED) didn't open our doors. We entered the restaurant and the host barely noticed us, even when the dining room was completely empty. The host stand was dirty and as she walked us to our table she didn't say a word to us. we requested a window seat and she acted like it was an impossible task. Even when the restaurant was basically empty. It took 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. We were worried we'd never be noticed. We did not even have drinks at this point. Once our server finally came over she introduced herself as Jane. From there it took another 30 minutes of her walking by our table, ignoring us as she visited the table next to us 4-5 times without saying a word to us. By this point, we then finally received our drinks. We got her attention finally and gave her our entire order for entrees, drinks and apps. We waited another 15 minutes and ended up walking out of the restaurant. There's no excuse for a server to be so rude and inattentive. Worst experience. Wish we could give the server zero stars as well as the restaurant it's self.  JANE SUCKED",

The chips were stale and the guac was mixed well.  The signature bistro steak was so bland. It was like eating a piece of leather with no seasoning.  The scallops were decent along with the beef short ribs. I wouldn't recommend this place if ur trying to take a date here. The view is nice but it's more freeway then something nice. I wouldn't recommend this place. Better spend ur money elsewhere.",

My main course was the trout, which was so good I would recommend it even to people who don't like fish. My wife had the cod and said it was only okay. Finished it off with the PB and chocolate dessert, which is generally a safe choice it seems. 4 stars only because my wife only liked her entree",

    "text": "Words cannot describe just how perfect our dinner was, but I will do my best. Chef Gregory made us a (mostly) off menu shared course tasting consisting of I believe 8 courses.  To start we had the trout tartar. Super clean and light with trout caviar. Perfectly seasoned for the clean taste that the dish was going for. For a nice effect it was served on a piece of trout skin \"leather\" which was a piece of trout skin that had been salt cured for two hours and then smoked at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for a few hours.  Next was a beer incorporated dish. A beautifully cooked piece of pork belly with a beer cheese soup served out of a French press. So rich and again, perfectly seasoned.  Following was house cured pork with cheese (I don't remember what kind) and grapes. This was served on a piece of cellophane that had been sealed over top of what looked like a fish bowl that had decorative rocks in it. The pork was super tender, which can be hard to achieve when curing most meats.  After that was chicken legs, cooked in a homemade teriyaki style sauce with a salad made of mizuna (a leafy green similar to arugula), shaved cantaloupe, and a light vinaigrette.   Next we had foie gras served on nopales picked out of the restaurants garden. There was pork fat streusel, lemongrass caviar, and hibiscus gelee.  Then seared scallop with purple potato puree (a varietal from Hawaii), roasted cauliflower, edible flowers, and garlic scapes.  Then the dry aged New York strip served with a red wine mushroom tea and shiitake mushrooms that were cooked perfectly al dente (for lack of better description).  Finally, we ended with an eggless custard made with quark, topped with roasted peaches, blueberry, and streusel. As well as a 7 layer chocolate cake that was layers of chocolate cake and banana ganache, with chocolate dots, bruleed bananas, and an horchata whipped cream. Both of which were heavenly.  We both tried drinks. I had the Sonoran sweet tea, the house made sweet tea infused vodka was just divine. Very light and able to compliment every dish. Hunny had the rye on the rocks and then the Arizona sweet tea, which was mixed with prickly pear syrup making it very sweet but still super drinkable.  Our server was wonderful. Very attentive without being omnipresent. Extremely nice. Was never gone so long that we ever wondered where he had gone or if we were forgotten about.  All around just an incredible evening, can't wait to come back!",

Every month we would celebrate with something special and our one year was important to both of us.   So... He took me to Top of the Rock.  I loved it immediately. The atmosphere, the decor and our table.  Now, I have a thing about waiters. I don't want them hovering, but I don't want them too far away either. Our waiter was friendly (but not trying to be our new best friend) and helpful and got our dinner to us in an orderly manner.   My Guy and I had an amazing time reminiscing and enjoying each other. When our waiter found out we were celebrating, he threw in a fancy dessert on the house.   How could I not like this place? Great service, amazing food and a wonderful view.  Celebrate here. You won't regret it!",

My husband ordered the pork chop, and I got the mushroom risotto. Both meals were plated beautifully and absolutely delicious. For dessert, he had the smores and I had the cheesecake custard.

However, it is an older place and could use a refresh. The big selling point is the views it offers of downtown Phoenix. We were there at sunset and it was beautiful.

For our food I ordered their Street Truffle Fries and the Shoyu Pork Belly.  The fries were like fingerling fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled atop; while the truffle oil was prevalent and welcoming to the palate and scent.  The Shoyu Pork Belly was probably my start of the evening.  Cooked and lightly seared with just enough gelatinous fat while the grilled pineapple provided a sweetness and the Szechuan sauce gave it a spicy pop!  For my entree, I ordered the Pork Tenderloin.  Cooked to just lightly pink and tender while the farro like pasta surrounding it provide some popcorn like texture.  The baked apples provided a welcoming sweetness.  In the end, Top Of The Rock has been around for some time and definitely a must visit spot for dinner.  The service was spot on and the views are beautiful! - Enjoy!",

They offer valet parking.  I had reservations via open table and were seated right away with a great view of all of Phoenix. Our group came for  Happy hour which is offered daily from 5pm - 7pm. Their are a good variety of food and drink options (limoncello, strawberry limoncello, sangria, beer and wine). Our hostess Andrew was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed and provided us plenty of attention at the Top of the Rock. The restaurant also offers outdoor seating with heat lamps. If you want a cool venue to enjoy some drinks with friends and have an awesome view this is your place!",

Loved the ambience. It is a nice romantic place with candle night. Having my wife with me was cherry on top. So the food I ordered was steak sirloin. And it was the best steak I had after a very very long time. I love my steak medium rear and it was cooked to perfection. I also had asparagus as my side it was nicely done too. There are some nice spots to clicked pictures. Parking scenario is pretty simple you can either do valet parking or you can park behind the building. It was a good experience will definitely visit again.",

    "text": "There are many great dining and date spots in the valley, and a compilation of preferred spots could potential result in an extensive list.  I would posit that this location should definitely be in anyone's list.  From the moment you begin your car's climb to the restaurant at the top of the hill, are greeted by the friendly valet(s), and are presented with a great view of the valley below - you'll know immediately that this isn't a typical dining establishment.  We arrived late in the afternoon, and before we ascended further up the steps into the restaurant; we opted to take a stroll to take in the impressive views before nightfall envelopes our point of view.  When we finally entered the restaurant, we were promptly and warmly greeted the the hostess. She confirmed our reservations, and guided us to our dining table. We were seated right at the center of the room, and this gave us a great perspective, as we had sweeping views.  Our dining combination for this particular evening was comprised of the Chicken & Doughnuts for the appetizers. And our main course was comprised of the Pork Tenderloin and the Roasted Chicken. For good measure, they provided us with a tray full of various freshly baked breads along with butter.   The sourdoughs and the corn breads, although poles apart in both texture and taste, yielded a wonderful combination to this evening's dining selection.  Additionally, I am not a Chicken and Doughnut fan, but this fusion definitely produced a reversal of my previous predisposition. The shredded, marinated chicken was especially delightful - moist, tangy, with a bit of spiciness. The doughnuts were slightly sweet and completely scrumptious.   The Pork tenderloin was delectable. Properly glazed and succulent. Each bite yielded a euphoric reaction from our palates. The vegetables that accompanied it were fine, but not especially memorable. The rutabaga was rather bitter. The nasturtium just felt like a garnish, not a vegetable.  I feel like the market vegetables or a potato accompaniment would have been better.    Contrarily, the Roasted Chicken wasn't exactly quite done to what I believe this establishment's high standards typically creates. The chicken was slightly dry, and it's texture was hard and not crispy. It was as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp far longer than they anticipated.   Don't get me wrong, the chicken's flavor was still delectable, and the aforementioned food preparation mishaps didn't entirely detract from it's overall enjoyment. In a perfect night such as this, it just seemed out of place.  Speaking of a perfect night, we stayed longer than we anticipated as I was enjoying my Beloved's company and sharing the week's experiences. Thus, dusk's light that previously illuminated the valley, was now replaced with darkness. And the glittering array of lights along the Valley floor made for a resplendent backdrop to this evening's dining affair.   The only sight more breathtaking was the glitter of love within my darling's dark green eyes as she looked at me under the moonlight.  (This completes my Yelp! 100 challenge for 2018.)",

    "text": "I would've given it a 5 star but the overpriced steak didn't really meet my expectations. It wasn't bad though. It was good enough. But could be better.  We had the New York steak and the filet.  We were placed outside cause the booths were all taken despite the fact that we already reserved. We didn't like the high too table/chair. I thought it was weird sitting there in the middle of other booths and by the door. Weird placement. It was chilly and windy outside by the outdoor heater helped. Our server was very attentive though.  It's romantic and great place for romantic date. We spent our anniversary here. It wasn't bad. I just think it's overpriced for a regular steak. It didn't taste special. I could honestly get better one in Texas Roadhouse.  Overall, it was great. Service was great. Vibrance is nice. We just got unlucky from the wind outside the restaurant that night. They made us a plate that said \"Happy Anniversary\" so it was a plus.  The total was overpriced but I guess it was worth it. I just think the steak could be better. It tasted like they used Montreal steak seasoning that guy can just buy from the grocery store for $2.  I give it a 4 for it's great service from our server. I think his name is Guillermo.  Vibrance is nice and romantic which was also a plus. Steak was nothin special. Our appetizer was really good though. It was one of their soup of the day or something. It had artichoke in there, I forgot the name, but that was good.  Would recommend to anniversary or birthday dinner but I would suggest not getting the steak. It was overpriced for the taste you can just get somewhere cheaper.",

The menu is the same as a previous posters photo from a month ago.  If the happy hour items are indicative of the full menu we are unlikely to return. We ordered, the pork belly, yakotori duck confit, small salad, squid in caper sauce, and I had the Tempe Paloma cocktail.  While the dishes were nicely presented each was lacking in its own way.  The duck confit was tossed and what seemed to be a dry spinach fettuccine. We used the sauce from the squid dish to fix it up. My drink was practically all ice, and I mentioned this upon ordering a second one, so I admit I was a bit annoyed to pay $16 for basically one and 1/4 drink. It also tasted different second time around different being better but inconsistent.  The pork belly was the highlight. I felt like my herb vinaigrette salad was spicy for some reason, I couldn't place it and I gave it to my husband instead.  I did not want to bother the staff as we had moved tables and didn't want to be annoying but they could tell I wasn't eating, my husband is a garbage disposal willing to eat anything in front of him so... We will find a new spot for the unusual chance we get a night out together.  Service was timely and attentive except on the delay of my second drink. If I wanted to pay $4 for a club soda and a delicious pork belly dish I would have to find another spot.",

The waygu was also very good. My only reason I give this experience 4 stars is because of the temperature of the food. Nothing came out hot.  Unfortunately all the food was just mildy warm. There weren't any cold spots or anything but still I think the food should have came out a little hotter.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I had planned on eating here for awhile because we assumed the high menu prices and pretty venue, it would be a great restaurant. We have both been servers and bar tenders and pride ourselves on finding restaurants we love coming back to. This restaurant, however, we did not like. The service was great and we had no problem with that, she was attentive and sweet.  We started with the savory chicken doughnuts which was the best part of the meal and came out pretty quickly after we ordered, then for our entrees  we had the two wash ranch chicken and the niman ranch pork chop. The pork chop was tough, and was half raw and half over done with some warmish collars greens and piping hot fingerling potatoes, it's pretty odd when separate parts of a dish come out at such drastically different temperatures and I didn't like my food at all. The chicken was better, but we were given one thigh price that was pretty well done and then what I am assuming was breast meat with pesto on the back? Honestly the under side of this meat looked like green dog food and was on the verge of being raw. For nearly $40 for just the pork chop I expected much better, and $30 for the chicken is pretty pricey as well. You would think the chefs could at least cook the food through.  Having said all that, we did not stay for dessert and we will not be back again for an $80 raw meal.",

    "text": "Top of the Rock is an upscale, enjoyable dining experience in the heart of Tempe. If you are looking for a restaurant to impress a date, family, friends, or anyone frankly, this is it. Open in the evenings, they offer an awesome happy hour menu that you can begin your meal with delicious handmade cocktails while watching the sunset over pretty much all of Tempe/downtown Phoenix. The decor has been given a modern spin on the beautiful interior this restaurant has to offer from when it was constructed. Gorgeous succulents to garnish the table along with candle-light, and hand made wooden plates with a delicate, but creative paper-style menu.  William was our server and he was fantastic. We felt welcome at TOR by all the staff, and had a great presentation of every dish that was brought out. William suggested we start out with the 'chicken and doughnuts' appetizer- homemade potato doughnuts on a jalapeno cream cheese with shredded chicken topped with a fresno chile caramel glaze... Holy cow was this plate AWESOME. Kudos to Chef Greg! The perfect savory + not too sweet start to our dinner.   For the second course, we had the heirloom tomato salad with local ingredients and a delicious feta cheese on top. Third, out of William's recommendations, I decided on the 35-day aged New York for my entree, which arrived a perfect medium rare, and my boyfriend enjoyed their special of the evening- locally sourced tilapia with a beurre blanc and morel mushrooms. Incredible.  We finished with the homemade pineapple cheesecake and the manager, Carl, even stopped by to chat about our meal and make sure that everything was wonderful. I was so impressed with our whole dinner at Top of the Rock. You have a view that cannot be beat, an interesting, innovative menu that changes seasonally so you can always come back for more, and a staff that truly cares about you having the best experience possible. Thank you to William, Carl, and Chef Greg for a great evening! We will be back with many friends.",

Guillermo was nice and did his best though, with the big group.   I pulled up my free drink with check in coupon from Yelp and the manager says \"well not everyone gets a free drink, just you\" ummm I didn't ask for a free drink for everyone, lol.   Anyway, we ordered drinks and apps and 1 hour and 48 minutes later our food arrives. Cold. I paid $28 for a cold hunk of meat with no sides. It was a very sad looking plate. Got some fries on the side too, not great. $7 for what appeared to not even be a whole potato.   I think this place is trying too hard to serve unique fusion style dishes, and isn't doing very well. The menu didn't have a huge variety. It was a nice looking place with a pretty view (of the I-10) but I don't think I'd go back with that specific menu.",

    "text": "I should have looked at the Yelp reviews, but it didn't really matter anyway, because I was staying at the Marriott Tempe Butte resort without a car, so I was going to eat on site no matter what.  The food is overpriced (no surprise for a resort), portions small (I am not a big eater), and the taste of the food was ok.  I ordered the duck breast, but swapped lentils for \"congee\" that is normally served with the short rib.  the congee was not really a porridge, but slightly thicker, but the bigger problem was that it had a weird taste and flavoring that I didn't like at all, and didn't taste Asian to me, either.  the duck was ok, but it was served medium rare (as often is in higher end restaurants).  although I love my steak medium rare, I don't like my duck medium rare, so I asked them to cook a little more.  the chairs outside are pretty uncomfortable and hard, and the view is of the freeway, but it wasn't a bad view, either.  the service was good.  they refilled my club soda several times and let me go back to the room with a to-go cup.  I would avoid eating there again, because of taste, portion size and cost.  The lobby bar was slightly better (at lunchtime -- see my other review).  the bread is not that great either, but they give you 3 different kinds -- madeleine shaped cornbread (the best of 3, but not amazing), some hard thing I didn't eat, and a hard-crusted slice of baguette which was ok, but not amazing either.  they serve the bread with honey butter.",

They have a menu that changes monthly, but if the grilled octopus is available when you go you have to try it.  The prices are a value for the complexity and quality of the food.  If Top of the Rock was in a city like Los Angeles, it would easily be 300% higher.  Great wine list, you can't go wrong.

They also told us that all of the tables had reservations and when we were finally seated, NONE of the tables around us filled up, it was almost empty in the restaurant. I have never received service as bad as this place. I ordered a sangria, the waitress \"forgot\" that I ordered it, whilst I waited over 30 minutes to receive my drink. This place is just all over terrible service. If I could rate them 0/5 stars I would. The food was not that great for the price, and when I finally got my sangria it was so heavily spiced with cinnamon I could barely drink it. Hopefully they have improved since I went there, as it was 2 years ago, and I finally got around to reviewing this place.",

    "text": "On the the upside, this restaurant has beautiful views and some interesting architecture (I like the ceiling a lot).  Unfortunately, probably because of the large open area and high ceiling, it does tend to get incredibly noisy when busy, and might be better for a small group, or preferably just two people, so that you can hear each other.  I was here for a friend's birthday, and there were eight of us.  It was difficult to chat with the people on the far side of the table without a lot of shouting.  We came here on a Wednesday during restaurant week.  Although the waitress was polite, the service was incredibly slow, especially for a Wednesday!  I believe we were there for 45 minutes before our food order was even taken. For restaurant week, you choose a salad (I got the T.O.R House Salad), entree (I chose the Composition of Local Farmer's Vegetables) and a desert.  I'm a vegetarian so that was really my only option for an entree.  The salad was good, especially the beets.  The entree was PATHETIC! Firstly, it was just a few (really only a few) basic small roasted vegetables, and a tiny bit of rice.  Something I could easily do at home much better.  Considering the high price, I would have expected some effort made in terms of interesting or expensive ingredients, and preferably some kind of protein.  The portion was tiny!  It was smaller than I would expect for a one person appetizer, never mind a main entree.  It was frustrating that everyone else was complaining that they almost had too much food, but despite being a very small female, I was not at all satiated.  Just because I'm a vegetarian, it does not mean I'm attempting to starve myself with small carrots, I still want to eat!!  Hopefully they will read this review, and do something to improve their vegetarian entree option, as it really is a beautiful spot.  My cocktail was tasty, no complaints there.",

    "text": "Wow, I'm going to have to show this to my friend who thought I was \"being too picky\" when in essence, he obviously  has some simple ass taste buds.  It started out wonderfully. The sun was about 1/2 hour from setting and casting that orange glow that Phoenix does so well. We went there for the ambiance. I offered to treat. Little did I know, I was in for a treat and it sure as hell wasn't a good one.  So we get Kathy (I think that was this crappy waitress' name).  She takes my friend's drink order and I'm still deciding and she just walks away. No \"I'll be back\" or anything customer service-y like that. Then she comes back and takes my drink order. Fine.  She suggests the Pork chops and even though I eat 90% vegetarian, I go with her suggestion. Cause the alternative is one boring salad choice.  It comes back pink and rubbery. What the--?I don't give a crap what anyone says, pork ain't supposed to be pink. That  means it ain't cooked and I ain't eating it. So I send it back and it comes back clearly microwaved for a few seconds and guess what? Still freakin' pink on the inside.  Lovely! So this girl asks if I want to try the  Chilean Sea Bass. Ok, now I've had too much alcohol and I'm not thinking properly cause that shit's endangered - - very politically incorrect but I'm near my boiling point  so I  agree and think surely something's getting spit in or on.  Well, she brings out beers stating that \"he bought you  2 beers for the trouble\". Huh? He who? The waiter? The manager? And she damn near slams them on the table. Now I'm about to ghetto but my friend just casts me a look that puts me in check.  So the sea bass finally comes and you are seriously not going to believe this-----it was pink and pretty much undercooked. And of course, I had her take it back and then it came back flaky. I ate a few forkfuls but was pretty much frickin done at that point and now burdened with a 3-beer buzz within 1.5 hours. Not good.  That's why they put the restaurant on top of those damn rocks so you'll be distracted away from the crappy service, mediocre food, ignorant help, and gouging prices. There is no way that food is worth what they charge. And I agree 100% with the other reviewer that I could have made that shit at home. Cooked thoroughly and a helluva lot tastier and I didnt go to culinary school.  There's so much more to bitch about people but I'll stop right here or you'll be scrolling down forever. I apologize for all the cussing. I don't normally in my reviews cause I think it's tacky. But this review could not have been True to itself without these appropriate words.  I can't believe I tipped that jerk. What the heck was I thinking. One star and that's only for the view.   DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FOOD! DRINKS MAYBE SO YOU CAN GET THE VIEW BUT THATS IT!",

I was hesitant, since I had never been here before, and saw the negative reviews here on Yelp.  I'm glad we went.  It was restaurant week, so we ordered off the prix fixe menu for $29 per person.    We got ahi, salads, filets, lamb, creme brulees, molten lava cakes, bananas foster.... oh my!  The Romanians had never had filet mignon, and didn't really understand it.   They kept eating it saying \"how can it be so tender?\"  \"is this real cow, or fake?\" LOL  The restaurant knew it was their first day ever in America, so the manager, the chef, everyone came over to welcome them.  In addition, they gave us the table with an awesome view of the entire city.    To conclude, our waiter offered to give us a brief tour, and photographed all of us together in various locations.    I really, really was impressed.",

The ambiance has always been spectacular.  Service has been mostly good.  But the food is the part that is clearly making a come-back.  We have gone here a few times recently, most notably for the well known champagne brunch, and had a great time.  Just beware that the brunch is all-you-can eat, and there's a great selection from the omelet bar to the raw bar to the always underrated pastries.  Maybe a hike around the property after your feast?",

    "text": "This restaurant is sadly disappointing. My husband and I were looking forward to dinner at this cool looking restaurant situated on top of a rock. The indoor architecture is beautiful, and there is a pretty night view of Tempe lights. Unfortunately, the food and service is not up to par, not even close. We were early for our evening reservation on a Friday night, and were told to sit in the 'lounge' which faces the chaotic & cluttered open kitchen. We sat for 30 minutes waiting for drink service, but no one approached us. We asked the hostess about the bar 'downstairs', and the manager interrupted by explaining that it had closed it's doors over 4 years ago (even though the Tequila Bar sign is still displayed on the building). We decided to go over to the outdoor Marriott pool bar next door, which was way more accommodating for a couple of drinks.... When we got back to Top of the Rocks, we were seated, and greeted by a pleasant server who was overwhelmed with tables. Management seemed to be seating everyone in one section of the restaurant, so there was chaos & loud chatter throughout dinner. We were seated near a mid 40's couple with a teenage son who was playing hacky sack in the isle...  The meal itself was not noteworthy at all. Not impressed by the menu selections, my husband and I both ordered the 'surf & turf' - filet stuffed with crab meat, topped with hollandaise sauce. The filet came out in 2 small pieces each the size of diver scallops. The tiny bite of crab meat in the filets did not taste fresh. The plate was accompanied by a smear of mashed potato, and 3 baby carrots. We ordered a side of macaroni & cheese, and it came out in a 2 ounce dish. Still hungry from dinner, we ordered the 'black forest' cake desert. It was 2 small brownie bites topped with dried cherries, and finished with a small scoop of store bought (?) vanilla ice cream. Sad to say, we will not be returning to this restaurant, and we will not recommend it to any friends or family looking for a decadent meal or desert. No sense enjoying a rock top view if you can't be blown away by the food.",

Valet made parking easy, and there was no fee other than the tip.  We were not disappointed with our choice to have dinner here. We arrived shortly before sunset and were seated right by the windows. Our server had great recommendations and we loved the heirloom tomatoes and taco appetizers. For main courses, we ordered the pork belly and the fried chicken. Yum! We were surprised afterwards with a complimentary mousse dessert for the birthday. Very pleased with views, food, and service. No complaints here.  All throughout dinner, they had live entertainment. Tonight it was a man, his guitar, and cover songs,and it really set the mood and everyone there seemed to be in good spirits.   Can't wait to come back in a month or two to sample the fall menu. Seems like a great place for special occasions and dates because it offers something different than most restaurants around.",

Plates were cleared before everyone was finished a course.  At an Applebee's, I can forgive that.  At restaurant with pretensions of class, it isn't done.  For the slow eaters, it creates a sense of hurry.  It undercuts the atmosphere that a good restaurant would try to create.",

    "text": "This was our second try at the Top of the Rock. To be honest there are a few reasons I cannot give this 5 stars, so lets start with that so I can end on a high note.   First off, $5.00 for valet or you get to park down a steep hill and walk to the place. I think for the overall price point offering valet  to patrons should be free, of course tipping your valet when you leave. The other reason,  the decor of the place. It feels really dated, granted the view at sundown is amazing, but still there needs to be a little updating. Lastly, our server, she was very nice, and pleasant however she did offer us bread... OK, OK  maybe she did save our waistlines, but at the end of our meal we saw what looked like delicious rolls brought to another table and we all wondered why we not offered any, I mean hey, we get the option to be fatties, right? Side note, the servers also wore jeans....not a huge deal, but did not help the ambiance...  Now on to the drinks, I had a prickly pear margarita, it was way too sweet for me (I should have known better so not issue there), the hubby had not one but two of their kiwi caipirinha's. I followed up with a regular Margarita on the rocks, it was decent.  OK now the food. We started with the shrimp appetizer, we ordered two, one for each couple to split. They were grilled with honey and lime, and had house made potato gnocchi. There was a mixture of mission figs, chorizo and cheese that accompanied the shrimp. The dish was down right awesome. The flavors were very well balanced and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. We were all very impressed.   Each of the four of us had our own main dish. I had the seasonal veggi dish. Lets just start off with the fact that yes, you can mess up vegetables, but these were great.  Artisan carrots, broccolini, asparagus, buttery pieces of brussle sprouts, pouched beets all over your choice of purple roasted potatoes, red quinoa, their specialty french fries, and their might have been another choice, but I got the quinoa. It was great, and  I am not a vegetarian BTW, but I wanted something lighter to eat (so dam hot out) and this was honestly good and filling. The husband had the chicken and dumplings which I had a bight of, it was a little salty for my pallet, but he sang its praise. It was made with gnocchi too. The other couple with us had the pork tenderloin which was melt in your mouth fantastic, and the pan-seared scallops. These scallops were huge!  I am totally picky about scallops, I only like em small, so I passed, but both my husband and the person who ordered the dish said they were great.   Finally, desert. We were all honestly full, but I could not pass up the bread pudding. We all kind of split it. House made cinnamon ice cream with queen creek pears. We were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I do wish there was a better chocolate option on the menu, but that's OK I guess.   Over all, I am looking forward to returning to Top of the Rock! The service, was great, the food was eclectic, gourmet and unexpected. I really enjoyed this place our second time around. Oh, the bill for five drinks, two apps, four dinners, two espressos, and a dessert was $190.00 (without tip)! That's a great deal in my book!",

I had the steak tartare which was nice, but my wife's salad was pretty salty and overdressed. My dad got the avocado toast and that was amazing!  For the main course my dad had the marlin and likes it. We had the beef cheeks which were okay. It was hard for me to even remember what we ordered because it was pretty basic, well balanced but nothing special.

    "text": "BACKGROUND  The Tempe Buttes Resort was originally developed by Carefree Resorts and first opened in 1986. Later to be sold to Wyndham and since 2006, has been owned and managed by Marriott.  Although one of the most obvious complaints is the proximity to the interstate, the Buttes has remained an impressive resort by any standard.  The 353 room, 9000 square foot, well appointed meeting space, 2 pools, tennis court and hiking trail resort offers a variety of food and beverage options, (including breakfast spot Market Cafe, which I reviewed previously). The resort's signature restaurant, Top of the Rock, is upscale American cuisine in a unique environment, featuring dramatic city views.  THE EXPERIENCE  Valet park and walk up the steps, into the main restaurant, hear the smooth jazz or extended remix of Sade, see the view and instantly feel like it's going to be a great night, regardless of how your mood was previously. Even better, bring a date.  Top of the Rock opens at 5pm everyday. You can start with Happy Hour, from 5-7pm, or go straight to dinner. The menu is fun with things like beef pot pie (see pic), traditional cheese and meat board (see pic) to full dinner entrees. The kitchen is head up by Executive Chef Gregory Wiener, I've been many times and everything I've ever eaten has been superb!  The wine list is substantial and the cocktails are creative, like House Made Sangria or Sonoran Tea, which is vodka infused sun tea, lavender bitters, lemon juice, and charred lemons. (see pic)  The service was outstanding.  CONCLUSION  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Valet parking is complimentary or self-park in the Hopi lot or the North Circle.  *Dress Code: Causal Dress  *Window and patio seats are first come first serve basis.  *Free Happy Hour cocktail with food order upon Yelp check in.  *Hours: Happy Hour: Mon-Sun 5pm-7pm Dinner: Mon-Sun 5pm-9:30pm  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftopoftherockbuttes.com&s=25ca0a921209aa277bdd75a1208b410f6eb8db9c2a4b0949668a006fa55e3107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">topoftherockbuttes.com</a>",

TOTR did not disappoint  The food was delicious and innovating. The Chef accommodated my picky 7 yr old son by preparing an off menu Special request and the service was Top of the Rock! William was absolutely perfect. Informative, with a complete understanding of the menu and wine list. He was there when we needed him without making himself a distraction, truly a Superstar. Toward the end of meal Christina showed up and found a new friend in our Son. She was genuinely compassionate and attentive. What a special night. The atmosphere and view was breath taking but second to the staff. Thank you for your energy.",

We saw that the restaurant was half full. They took our cell number and suggested that we have a drink at the lobby bar and they will call in approximately 15 minutes when the table was ready. After waiting at the lobby bar for over 45 minutes we went back to the restaurant. As we approached the hostess stand she said she was about to cancel our reservations. She claimed she called us, text us, and called the lobby bar. I cannot believe that they were wrong on all accounts. They seated us. Food was average. They did comp us with an appetizer. Nice. But did not make up for the incompetent staffing",

    "text": "I went to Top of the Rock on February 13th for a Valentines date. The ambience is amazing. This is a restaurant I've wanted to visit for some time. It was the most romantic restaurant I've eaten at. The weather was gorgeous so we sat outside with views of the valley. I don't think you can top the amazing view you're able to see from their patio.   Dinner was a special prix fixe Valentines menu. The 4 course meal came with a glass of champagne, but as non alcohol drinkers we were pleased that they also offered a glass of sparkling cider.   The first course was a small Amuse of a single oyster in the shell with a pepper jelly. Honestly neither of us were really oyster people. The pepper jelly was nice, but this was our least favorite dish of the evening.   We added an additional item after the oysters of the grilled asparagus. This dish was beautiful and with a perfectly poached egg on top. The sweetness of the ginger streusel was the perfect touch.   For the second course we tried the hearts on fire salad (I'll attach a picture of the menu and descriptions) and the house salad. The house salad was amazing, but the goat cheese panna cotta in the hearts on fire salad was a little disappointing. It was barely recognizable as goat cheese. A very mild flavor. Both of us are goat cheese fans but found this dish underwhelming. The rest of the salad was fairly good though.   For the main course we went with the duck and the steak. Both dishes are absolutely delicious. The duck was cooked perfectly and the whole combination of flavors was devine. The steak was delicious medium, the short ribs it sat upon stole the show. I just wish there was a little more chimichurri sauce.   Dessert was rich and plentiful. We tried both desserts. The chocolate mousse was perfect. The red velvet trifle was good, but the only complaint was that the actually pieces of red velvet cake were dry. I am a hobby baker and cake decorator... So dry cake really sticks out to me.   Overall the service was wonderful, the view spectacular and the food delicious. It was the perfect Valentines Dinner.",

    "text": "Top of the Rock is a New American restaurant attached to the Marriott Buttes hotel that overachieves hotel restaurant standards. You might confuse the restaurant for a bunker designed for the ultra-wealthy Leonardo DiCaprios of a post-apocalyptic zombie world, but rest assured, this is not the case.  I visited with a few colleagues for a celebration dinner. The charred broccoli was challenging to cut through but had delicious florets. The risotto's poached egg was a game changer. If you're looking for a fun, small dish to share, I'd recommend the carrots.   Top of the Rock is more on the expensive side - you might suspect they are upcharging because of the hotel's proximity and the price insensitivity of business travelers. But the view was incredible, the food was satisfying, and the service even tossed in a free dish and free beer.  At first, I was a bit peeved: I didn't order the beer or the appetizer, and here they are, will I have to pay for this? Then the server said they were on the house, which caused an injection of confusion into my mammalian brain. I enjoy surprises, I guess, and this turned out nicely.  I'd return if I were staying in the area. There weren't many other vegetarian options on the menu, but I'm sure chef Gregory Wiener could whip something up.",

Started with soup of the day; taste was fine, but there was so little in the bowl, that it wasn't even as deep as my spoon. For $8 I cant even fill my spoon? Are you kidding? Sent back. Manager came over to explain that they use 8oz ladled out.. Well, dont use a super wide bowl or give me more for my $1 per oz soup. PS, manager, I dont care about your ladle... I do care about being ripped of. Bad explanation.   Next up, we got the cheese and meat appetizer platter. Every piece of meat on the plate tasted like nothing else I've ever had (read not good), but the cured duck tasted like a household chemical cleaner. Just awful. The bread on platter was nothing special, and mostly it was very poorly matched to the meat, assuming the meat was decent. The cheese was poorly presented, and also nothing special. By the time it came out, we were so hungry, we ate what we could.... Sans that horrid duck.   The duck was so bad, i was worried about food poisoning.. luckily that didn't happen...  Next comes my $40, 8oz Wagyu beef short ribs. Totally fatty and tasteless. I've had Wagyu before, and I am suspicious that this wasn't that. I've had brisket better than this. Not good.   Another person in my party got roasted chicken breast which was ok- I've had equal for $15. Nothing to write home about.   Dessert? Nope... ended the misery...",

I thought with everything we got, it was going to cost more. But it was very reasonable for a fancy dinner! We even got 2 free drinks for checking ourselves in.

    "text": "This restaurant is lovely!  I came here for Restaurant Week with a group of 10 and our entire experience was so easy and enjoyable from start to finish.  First off, you can make (and change) reservations online which is so convenient.  Second, parking is really easy.  There is complimentary valet OR you can just drive slightly past the restaurant and to the left and park in the hotel's back parking lot, which is what I did.  When we arrived, our table was all set up, with these really cool tree stump table settings.  One strange thing is that even though it was Restaurant Week, they didn't have those menus on the table and we had to ask for them.  The food was excellent!  I seriously LOVED the watermelon salad.  I'm so glad our server explained things to us, bc it made me appreciate even more the effort and invention involved in the dishes.  For example, the watermelon in the salad wasn't just chopped watermelon, it was actually compressed and vacuum sealed in its juices to make it sweeter and the flavor stronger.  It was delicious and so refreshing.  My short ribs entree was alright.  It was actually a lot of food and I had to take most of it home so I could have room for dessert -- which was a super rich chocolate cake with a peanut butter addition (also suuuper rich! but not in a bad way).  Overall, a really lovely meal and at Restaurant Week prices, a great deal (only $42 for 3-courses including tip and tax).  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the view isn't great from EVERYWHERE in the restaurant, and since I think you are paying more for the view, every table should have a nice spot.  Most of our view was obstructed by a wall.",

    "text": "Great food ruined by abysmal service. Came with two co-workers who were both staying at the hotel and we were seated promptly and the server came right away to take drink orders and then... nothing. And more nothing. And more nothing. These weren't complicated, exotic orders... we're talking a soft drink and a couple of martinis. When they finally arrived (after several attempts to flag down the blissfully unconcerned server) she actually tried to make a lame excuse about the order being complicated!   We took that as a cautionary tale and ordered food right away. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. This wasn't just a leisurely paced meal- we sat with dirty appetizer plates on the table for almost 40 minutes. We had several excellent meals when they finally arrived- halibut, pork tenderloin and another that I don't recall, all got raves but the service completely undercut the whole experience and we most certainly won't be back.",

    "text": "The view here - definitely amazing. No complaints there, but definitely not my favorite food on this trip.   I came here for Phoenix Restaurant week and wasn't really offered that menu. There was another prix fixe menu, but it wasn't something I was interested in. Therefore, i just ordered a la carte a few dishes that sounded good to me.   The savory chicken donuts - well that's interesting. I expected the donuts and chicken to be a bit more combined on the dish separately and close together. It was good, I loved the bit of jalapeno cream cheese - definitely a good portion to the dish.   I then ordered the pork tenderloin. It was good, but the tenderloin pieces are kind of small. The dish was kinda meh on all ends. not bad, but not great either.   My last dish was the lemon verbena panna cotta. The graham cracker crust made it difficult to eat. The prickly pear was not as strong as I expected in the gelee. If I see a certain ingredient is on the menu, I'd expect to be able to taste it. Definitely wished I did.   Overall, not a bad place, but the food wasn't amazing either.   Protip: eat outside and have a great view.",

The knudi side was not what I expected and really had no flavor and the texture was a little off. The rib eye was good expect that it was over cooked. The best thing our table had was the bread and butter, brussel sprouts, and our appetizers which were the chicken and donuts and Thai peanut shrimp. I would not recommend the peach cobbler with cinnamon ice cream. The peach isn't fresh and the pastry is oatmeal. Completely not expected and way off. Overall it was ok. However we did like our waitress. She was fun and provided great service.",

Some  apple and bourbon drink with fresh apple and ginger, wonderful.   The food, however, left a lot to be desired. We ordered the chicken and donuts to start. They came out very quickly (under 2 minutes which even surprised our server) but were cold most of the way through and room temperature on the bottom which leads me to believe (after 13 years in the kitchen industry) that they were an earlier mistake, sat around and then were pawned off to the next table that ordered them, lucky us. For entrees, we got the duck breast with beluga lentils and the short rib with risotto. Both dishes were woefully under seasoned, with the short rib specifically having zero noticeable salt throughout the entire dish. While the duck was the better of the two, it was served medium-well (who does that?) with soggy skin and a barely noticeable amount of seasoning. Coupled with a creative,  yet equally under seasoned orange-cherry broth and it resulted in a bland dish that resembled some sort of lentil soup by the end of the meal.   All said and done our bill was $170 and I'm sorry to say but it simply was just not worth the price-tag. It's very unlikely we'll be returning, although the space itself is beautiful.",

I ended up going with what they had already offered, but the manager emailed my boyfriend a list of other items that are able to make, all of which sounded very unique and interesting (much better than the vegetable pasta most places offer to vegetarians). They were so accommodating and I greatly appreciated their efforts!   During dinner, the sun was setting and we were trying to take a picture. Our waitress not only noticed and came by to offer to take the picture for us, but she also offered for us to go onto the balcony and take a picture outside. It was so sweet of her :) :) :)   The only reason I'm not giving this place a better rating, is because I wasn't too impressed with the food. We got the avocado toast, which was tasty however the bread was too hard to even bite into around the crust. I got the lemon risotto, which was light and the duck egg was cooked very well, however I just didn't enjoy it much. I wish there was a bit more oomph to is. The dessert we got, the chocolate cake, was a bit like a mixture of fudge mousse and cake. It was very rich, but tasted good with the caramelized bananas on top.",

The holiday decorations were beautiful and the views - as always - were breathtaking.  They had just changed their menu.  I had planned to order Scallops, but they were off the menu (this change was not reflected on their web site); instead I ordered short ribs which were delicious as was the Beet Salad starter.  All in all a great meal and we all enjoyed ourselves.  Our server - Neysa - was great.  She was friendly and attentive.  She offered good suggestions and went out of her way to make sure there were no surprises with our orders. (e.g., she made sure to explain to me that the Beet Salad was beets-only and not beets with greens - she had had other customers who had not expected this - she wanted to make sure I did - and the salad was great!).  Thank you, Neysa! My only suggestion would be valet parking.  When we pulled up the valet parking was located in front of the hotel and not the restaurant (even though there was a Valet desk in front of the restaurant). The was inconvenient - especially since the weather was a bit inclement.  And when we left I had to go find the Valet to get our car.  When I have eaten here before the Valet service was available at the restaurant (too).",

Of course, if I had to pay the bill, I might be pickier, but since work was picking up the bill I'm giving Top of the Rock 4 stars.  Since there were about 20 of us, we had a more edited selection and we made our choices the day before. I had the caesar salad which I thought was really good and enjoyed the parmesan crisps. For my main I went with the NY strip steak. It was a really big piece of meat and well cooked. The mashed potatoes were a little on the chunky side, but hey some people like it that way. The only real disappointment was the dessert. I don't remember the exact description, but I was under the impression that it was going to be some sort of vanilla cake. What came out instead was basically flan and I HATE flan. I was so bummed, I'd been suffering through 8 hours of meeting for my dessert! My coworker was kind enough to offer me some of her chocolate mousse cake and it was so rick that I could only manage a bite (probably a good thing!).  Anyway, I thought the service here was great. It was pretty empty at 7 PM on a Thursday night, so service was very attentive and efficient. The view at sunset is definitely worth 5 stars on its own. It's fairly pricey, so unless you have a generous company picking up the bill, it's probably best for a special occasion.",

    "text": "First I want to say that I went to Top of the Rock during restaurant week and was able to purchase a whole meal for $50. The restaurant was beautiful and driving up to it was very fun. We got a table right by the window and looked out over Tempe for our meal. As far as the view goes it was amazing and I would go back just for that.  The inside of the restaurant was lovely with a very unique type of glass lodge decor. The vaulted ceiling is beautiful.  The hostess was very friendly and seated us quickly. Our server on the other hand was just a bit annoying. He was loud and swore occasionally. Now while I don't have anything against swearing it was weird for it to happen here, even though the words were very mild (hell, damn). He had another table right next to us and they were so loud. He contributed to it and eventually it just became something my boyfriend and I watched while eating our food because it was just, well, there. It was annoying because most of the rest of the restaurant was empty and I really wanted to move because of how loud it was. We should have asked to move but I always feel awkward about that.   Now the food was a completely different story. It was amazing. My boyfriend had their Scottish salmon dish and I had a filet of beef. Oh my it was amazing! My food was so good I would willingly pay $30 for it again. The sauce was a perfect compliment to the fingerling potatoes and the thin slices of sausage. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce meshed well with everything on the plate.   I really enjoyed the food and after the loud table left and out server went and bothered someone else I had a great time. I would definitely go back but if we get the same server I'll ask for someone else!",

The service was excellent. I sat outside and enjoyed the view, looking out to downtown. The appetizer was a veggie cheese plate, and it was good. For the main course I had a grilled salmon with polenta. The salmon was excellent, perfectly seasoned, but the polenta was dry and old. They could have made a new batch, but I'm guessing since it was 30 mins from closing, they didn't want to take the time. So that's what ruined the meal for me. I didn't say anything, I don't like to complain. The dessert was a chocolate ganache with honeycomb. It was ok, not the best ganache I have had, the honeycomb was old and hard to eat. Overall I wouldn't go back even at $30. The chefs clearly were ready to go home for the night.",

Of course we started with cocktails and had the Smokey Nail which is by far my new favorite drink. The food is exceptional. We had the cold smoked shrimp with asparagus and squid ink aioli, followed by the beet salad with kohlrabi and goat cheese parfait which were perfect starters. We then had the herb gnudi with eggplant and tomato broth which was to die for! For our entrees, I had the cocoa nib blackened Ono with roasted cauliflower and fennel potato puree, while my friend had the seared scallops with butternut squash risotto. Everything was cooked perfeclty. The presentation of the food is only exceeded by the beautifully paired flavors and textures. No small detail is overlooked, from the menus to the table settings, everything is unique and interesting. This restaurant really sets itself apart from the rest and makes the guest feel like they aren't just enjoying a fabulous meal but having a real dining experience. Will definitely be back often.",

We ordered the prawn appetizer; there were 3 1/2 sized  prawns fried and skewered sitting on a GREASY OIL SOAKED napkin with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce on the side....happy hour priced @ $9.00. The 2nd  appetizer was their cieviche of which ive seen similar representation in the deli department at Albertsons.....not impressive at all, and it was served in a 4oz mason jar with crackers laid out on a plate like Grandma would serve, also $9.00 happy hour priced.  Eeeeeek! The drinks were also unimpressive, the dirty martini had oils floating on top and the supposed blue cheese olive was a creamy cheap imitation  @ $15.00 ea including the tax! We had to ask the waiter twice for napkins, by the time he brought them we had finished the 3 measly greasy shrimp! Sadly, the best part of the outing were the mints at the door on the way out. Never, never, never! What a gigantic disappointment!",

Chef Greg is that perfect blend of intense foodie and kind ambassador for Marriott, we hope Marriott pays him well...his menu has a distinct point of view, his platings are lovely, his staff really team plays with him.  Pinnacles...the cheese plate with pickled white beets and pickled mustard seed, the duck confit tacos, the Ono.  Because I really like this place I'll give the constructive thought that the masa flatbread could be skipped and the cappuccino needs to be served in a generous cup for the finish and the price - but those are blips.",

Free valet. Love the fire pit and comfy chairs. Had the smoked salmon tostada, tiny but delicious with lime sour cream on the side. The \"taquitos\" are really tiny soft tacos but they are really good--it's about taste, not huge portions.  Yelp check in resulted in a free drink--woo! The view is amazing and happy hour starts out light and ends w/ beautiful sunset views. Great for happy hour.",

We're vegetarians and they have a couple of choices for us and are also willing to modify/create dishes if necessary. The servers we had were all very friendly and provided excellent service. The service was prompt and we never felt like we were waiting for our food to arrive. Even if it did take long, it would give us more time to enjoy the view. It's always nice and the resort grounds are incredible too.  I'm not sure why they have received negative reviews. Our experience has always been nothing short of exceptional. Some of the prices are higher than a typical restaurant, but that is to be expected for a resort restaurant. We know that we are paying for the ambiance and the views.  Like any restaurant, I'm sure there is an occasional glitch here and there, but in my opinion, this restaurant in definitely worthy of more than one star that some reviewers have left.",

The food looked and was presented very nicely.   In my opinion and I'm a picky eater and don't like trying new things or exotic menu choices.  I also don't having a menu with only a few choices. Hindsight, room service has a more normal menu selection. Next time I will have a large pizza delivered to my room. While I commend them for using locally grown ingredients and supporting the local farmers and native agriculture, I still would have liked to see normal or ordinary food choices as well. I had the only normal option which was a steak. It was good, but given the price I'm rating it a 7 out of 10.   We did not need a reservation, though they were about 70% full. There was a steady stream of customers finishing up and new customers being seated.   Suggestion: Come for the view, spend time at the bar and eat somewhere else.",

She said they had planned to seat us by the window but it wasn't ready. We opted to wait the 10 minutes or so for the table she mentioned. It was a beautiful view and the food was good, not great. Our server, i believe his name was Joshua but am not quite sure, was great. He seemed very cheerful and was right there when we needed anything. Unfortunately, he never received the message that we were celebrating and I had hoped for something special for my fiance. I can only assume the hostess did not tell him. I was very disappointed. I had read a review about what a great experience someone had there for their birthday and felt that when it came to our experience they fell short. I would not go back for a special occasion but maybe otherwise.",
