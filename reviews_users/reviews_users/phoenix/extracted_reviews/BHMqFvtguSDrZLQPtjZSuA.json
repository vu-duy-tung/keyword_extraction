    "text": "After eating Fiesta Burrito, Filiberto's, Los Fav, and all others don't compare. Carne asada burritos from Fiesta are hands down the best I've had in Phoenix after 11 years. Drunk or sober, the food here is craveable to the point where I would give an arm and a leg to eat here one more time.  I've never dined in, nor ordered anything other than carne asada burritos. I've never had a reason to. The tortilla fresh, the meat is tasty, the perfect amount of onion and guacamole, then pour on the green sauce until your heart desires! Do not, I repeat, do not bring a date here unless you have some food fetish and want him/her to know it.  A friend of mine tried telling me that the burritos are bigger if you order in Spanish, but I disagree. Carne Asada is the same in Spanish or English... Super bueno!  Thank you Fiesta Burrito for opening my eyes to what great Mexican carne asada is all about. And also, thank you for ruining my taste buds to lesser quality Mexican restaurants. I am now going through a 12 step program to relieve the addiction you have caused. Writing this review is step 2 and I feel a relapse coming on.",

I actually eat their food sober, although after a night in old town the burritos are even tastier, if that's possible.   I usually get a breakfast burrito with ham, eggs, cheese and pico. Their carne asada is pretty good too, but it tastes more like ground beef than steak to me. I like to add rice and get a side of sour cream, and for a mere $5 they are definitely filling.   My only gripe is that Fiesta isn't open 24/7 or offer the late night hours that some of the other -beto's do (they're open til 3am on Friday which is great, but 2am on Saturdays and 1am during the week). I work at a bar and sometimes don't get off work until 2:30 or 3am and am disappointed when Fiesta is closed \"early\".",

They don't have carne asada fries, but they do have carne asada (haha, we made the mistake of asking if they had french fries).  I got their fish burrito and really liked it.

Whenever I visit these locales I am not looking for some exotic dish or specialties and typically stick to carne asada and breakfast burritos. Fiesta Burrito excels at both. Their beans, tortillas, and green sauce are pretty tasty as well. The rice is pretty standard and just okay. Whether you are looking to satisfy your Mexi-cravings or drunk as a mutha-fuckin' skunk, hit it up! They won't let you down.  Just a note: For all you whiteys (myself included) and transplants who praise the bland, sad-excuse-for-Sonoran-fare of Macayo's, Ajo Als, and the like or the valley's unfortunate taqueria staple, Filibertos, please try this place or Los Favs. You will thank me later.",

This is my all time fav mexican dish to eat. Never super greasy, always delish.  Occasionally the place will forget my guac or bacon, but they are usually pretty good about redoing the burrito. However, I will say the prices are slightly high. All the add-ons really ADD ON. Inside a refill is 69 cents, and they charge for extra hot carrots or pico.  Its not a bad place for some good mexican food at a fair price.",

From the Carne Asada or Bean and Cheese burrito to the Adobada tacos, Fiesta rocks!   One morning at work, my urge to skip my usual yogurt or oatmeal overcame me and I wanted a burrito (almost always a bean and cheese. yeah for breakfast. I'm strange like that!). I announced that I was going to my favorite taco shop and the questions starting rolling in. Where is this place? Are they good? etc etc. By the time I left, I had six orders, not including mine. So now every time I have a burrito urge, I try to keep it to myself, lest 6+ orders. Selfish, yeah. But that saves me on having to dole out 15 cups of red, green, and/or pico. :P   Speaking of red, green, and pico - try to only get 2 cups of green for myself. Though really I could easily use about 6 of them in one sitting. I would probably be kicking myself the next day.   HOW in the heck does Adam Richman - Man vs Food eat all that spicy stuff and not cry the next day on the toilet?!?   Anyhow - CLEAN, Fast, with Courteous employees. Did I mention clean??? This is NOT your average \"-bertos\" taco/burrito shop people!!",

I noticed that they flat-grill the Carne and put it in a kitchen bucket and then keep the bucket on the flat grill to keep it warm. If your burrito is made from the meat on top half of the batch it is good. If your meat come from the bottom it is soaked in grease and discusting. Hope they can come up with a better syatem. Until then you'll have a 50/50 chance of a good buro.",

Ordered a baby side of rice for 70 cents which was a nice since a normal side goes for a crazy 3 bucks. Scottsdale prices at a taco shop? The red sauce was the best part of the experience as it contained a good zing. How can rolled tacos be ready in 30 seconds at a drive through? I doubt these are fried up when I order - they must be sitting in a warmer somewhere. Might be best to get a burrito that they hopefully cook to order, but who knows at these kind of places. Few beers beforehand always helps the taste too.",

My friend found this place on Yelp and we decided to go since they had pretty good reviews and they were open until 2.   We got there around 1:30 and only the drive through was open. They let us walk through the drive in anyway. Some places wont let you do that. The staff was very friendly and funny. They messed around with the rest of our friends who were ordering while we were at the window paying. They have a small outdoor patio open where we ate so we didn't have to walk and eat or take our food home.   Our expectations for the food wasn't high and thought it'd be like Filiberto's. However, we were pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend and I both got the chicken tacos. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. I wasn't a huge fan of the hardshell. I prefer hardshell tacos but it just didn't have any flavor.   Overall, we had a great experience and if we're ever in need of food at 1 in the morning we'll be back if we're nearby. Otherwise, not sure if I would come here when there are other restaurants opened.",

    "text": "There's excellent value here at Fiesta Burrito, but unfortunately in this humble Yelper's opinion that value comes at the expense of quality. I've found some excellent fast Mexican across the country, but Fiesta Burrito comes in a bit below average, which was disappointing considering the reviews.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  There's nothing fancy at Fiesta Burrito, but one thing that there is is speed. Cash or card doesn't matter, and almost irrespective of what you order you'll have it hot and ready often under five minutes. That's impressive and certainly star-worthy. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Herein lies the goods folks. While I didn't take a picture, I opted for a steak and egg breakfast burrito, and cocked an eyebrow when I saw that it only cost $4.50. How big could this thing honestly be at a price point of only $4.50? Well folks, it turns out that it can be pretty damn big. I didn't take a picture, but imagine essentially a fully loaded Chipotle burrito. That's value. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Unfortunately, value doesn't always arrive hand in hand with quality, and that was very much the case here.   One thing I will say is that the tortilla was fantastic. I'm not sure if it was freshly made, but it tasted as though it was with a buttery flavor and grilled texture. However, the goods essentially stopped there. The eggs were bland, the cheese basic, and the steak questionable. To top it all off, for whatever reason this burrito had what must have been a full cup of grease coming out of it. Not good.   Sure, there was some decent (but runny) green salsa verde that improved things a little bit, but outside of the tortilla there was virtually no flavor here (salt? pepper? anyone?), which was really disappointing. No Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  It would appear that Fiesta Burrito has a loyal local following here in the valley, which I always like; but the experience left much to be desired for this out of towner. No Star Granted.",

I didn't like the burrito at all, unfortunately. Everything was fresh and the tortilla, quac, and pico were on point. The carnitas, however, was dry and fatty. I couldn't even chew through some bites.  I'm not really surprised with my experience at Fiesta Burrito. It's cheap and quick and similar to most fast food Mexican joints.

I don't know who the girl was in the drive-thru but RUDE and did nothing but blame me for the problem instead of taking responsibility.   I simply ordered and wanted chips with cheese and beef on them. We asked when ordering if this was ok and she never asked what kind of meat, just said thanks and rushed us to be done. Got to the window and we clarify about the meat...she says it would be carne asada....no thanks. She complained saying that would be normally and I need to specify when I order what I want. Hmmm when could I have as you rushed us. Then I told her I just wanted plain beef. After her \"fixing it\" she comes back saying \"it'll have peppers and onions and all in it is that ok?\" What?! No I said plain! I got annoyed and told her to just forget it because I was over it. Again she complained about us needing to specify what we wanted. Maybe it's called asking what someone wants and you clarifying for me? Traditionally at restaurants that's what happens...aka \"how would you like your eggs?\" \"How would you like that burger cooked?\" Yea. So again I explained exactly what I wanted and said she also hadn't asked us what we actually wanted. She said verbatim \"were not supposed to\". Excuse me what?! WHO and WHY would any order be in place. Why is anyone to KNOW or how what the meat would automatically be.   It was a let down experience and I left pissed. Though they ended up getting it right, her attitude and lack of responsibility was horrible and I will question going here again. Clean up your customer service! Food maybe good but your attitudes suck!  Ps. 2 stars only bc the food is good. Not GREAT, but good and standard for the cost you pay (reasonable).",

    "text": "I was very hopeful of this place. Right off the bat I seen a lot of great reviews and a loyal local customer base. Right off the bat to Yelpers... WATCH WHAT YOU EAT. I go inside with my girlfriend and decide to order the two carne asada burrito combo plate. Our burritos come out quick with the contents on the side, guacamole and the beans. My girlfriend likes to spoon her ingredients into her burrito bite by bite so she was very conscious of what bites she was taking. About half way into her burrito she spots a thin hair right in between the tortilla, god knows what body part that came from. I seen it in her face that she was about ready to throw up. She brings it to the attention to the cashier woman who really isn't fazed by the hair. One of the cooks in the background who over heard turned his back to us as if annoyed that we found a hair. So sorry if I bothered you with a hair that I didn't want in the burrito in the first place. I asked for my money back on one burrito, the one my girlfriend ate since I already ate mine unknowing if I ate anything myself. As soon as I did that both the cashier and a man who appeared to be the manager began inspecting the burrito. After really examining the proof the man nodded and the cashier gave us the money back. No apologies or anything. I felt like we messed up more by bringing to their attention. I get that accidents happen but to  be annoyed when it comes to stuff like that really shows a business deserves poor ratings like this. Think about the customer experience cause at the end of the day customers are the ones who get you the money to continue running.",

I am not only offended by the food that was offered to me but the portions are small and the price is too high. I used to love getting carne Asada fries or super nachos but this time I wanted something different. I got the #7 which is two burritos with rice and beans. With that being said I was overwhelmingly disappointed.. the food was gross to say the least and the I couldn't even finish any of my burritos which were beef and chicken. The chicken had so much liquid coming from it, it was repulsive and the beef was straight up unappetizing. Not only am I mad I paid 10 dollars for this but now I'm left still hungry unable to eat the food. I don't know what happened to fiesta burrito but this is not the standards I remember after school hanging out with friends. And I don't get me started to talk about the rice and beans.. what a sorry excuse for a Mexican establishment, I will not be a customer here any more.",

My total Fiesta burrito count (I only get burritos) is rapidly approaching the 600 range, and I must say that the top contender is the California. I highly recommend the California to both beginners and experienced Mexican food eaters alike. The shredded beef burrito and carne asada burrito are also fine options if you are looking to delve into some of earth's most delectable fruits.",

In fact, the bean and cheese burrito I had there was a virtual fiesta in my mouth.  Ignore the fact that I'd had 6 vodka/soda's just a tad earlier that night and this will still be a viable review.    But really, I've been to Fiesta Burrito on a few separate occasions-some sober, some not so much- and I've always enjoyed what I ordered.  Keep in mind I like to play it safe with cheese quesadillas, nachos without meat and of course, the much loved bean and cheese burrito, but the food has always been pretty tasty.  Prices are pretty cheap too, and like another reviewer mentioned, the food is a bit greasy, but it sure is tasty!",

I've had the tacos, the pork carnitas, tried the nachos, and the enchilada.  All have been pretty tasty, but everything is extremely greasy and I usually feel pretty gross upon exiting.  I'll probably break down and try breakfast sometime too.  Overall, you won't be disappointed with Fiesta Burrito.",

I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying \"okay\" and \"yes\" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say \"yes\" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying.   Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints.   As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. It's just a place for convenient late-night munchies.",

The prices are decent, they have a fairly extensive menu, and the service is fast.   The downsides?  1) Parking is very limited which caused me issues for the first time today. 2) Seating can sometimes be limited as well. It's a fairly small joint. 3) Being a non tomato fan and sometimes not being in the mood for guac doesn't leave me much of a choice here and my options are pretty plain and limited most of the time.  With that being said, it's definitely worth trying if you are in the area. I suggest the carne asada burrito :)",

Carne asada and adobada were topped with guac and salsa, while the fish reminded us of good fish sticks with shredded iceberg and Miracle Whip.  Carne asada was a tad dry but the adobada was full of flavor.  Rice was insanely salty which made us down a huge cup of Horchata.  We ate inside which was pleasant and clean.  They're open 24-hours - a great late night alternative to burgers from other nearby fast food joints.",

The only issue I had is they had a lot of cheese on the plater itself, but none of it was even remotely melted, and maybe it's just me, but I like melted cheese. It makes me think fresh made and that it's hot.  The interior was expected, just like a Filabertos or any other taco shop. A Nice Salsa Bar with pico, red sauce, green sauce, Whole Jalapenos and Spicy carrots.  Parking can be a little difficult as they on have 9 spaces two of which are handicapped, but they also have a drive thru. Definitely not enough parking for the table space and outside patio they have.  Well that's all for now....",

Nothing really stood out for me. The beans and rice were good, but the enchilada just didn't taste that good. I ended up finishing it all, but this is not a spot I would probably visit again!",

    "text": "UPDATE: after my last experience with Fiesta Burrito I have to say I AM NEVER GOING BACK. Why? I asked for a California burrito with guacamole, got charged for the guacamole, but it was never in my burrito. The burrito seemed to shrink 10% more than the last time I thought it shrank. It was definitely not worth the price at all. I  also got charged for an extra drink. When I went back to ask for my refund for the guacamole and the extra drink I was charged for the men just looked at me like I was crazy. He offered me a cup instead (which I didn't need I already had my drink) and I saw one man in the back filling up a tiny cup of guacamole (which I didn't need either because I had already eaten the tiny burrito) All I wanted was my $3.00 back for things I never received.   this place is always my go-to place for fast late night Mexican Food (only when Tacos Jalisco is closed) cleaner also. I know I wont have to worry about cockroaches roaming my food. I love how theyre so fast, and the food comes out tasting decent.  what I am concerned about is how small their burritos have gotten over the years. don't get me wrong, theyre still beasts, but they have definitely shrank in width. i know regulars would agree. their customer service is a bit lacking, so don't feel bad if theyre not attentive and don't exactly cater to your needs. you have to tell them if you want any extras and other customizations.   regardless, this is the place to go for super fast delicious Mexican food, that wont make you sick! PARTY burrito!",

    "text": "In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as \"across the street.\"  Kind of like, \"How about across the street?\"  \"Yeah, I could do across the street, today.\"  If I ever said, \"How about Fiesta Burrito?\"  I would get, \"Where's that?\"  Then I would have to say, \"You know, across the street.\"  And the response would be, \"Well, why didn't you say so in the first place.\"  The primary reason we eat at \"across the street\" is because it is convenient - it's across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, \"It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.\"  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that \"across the street\" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at \"across the street\" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing.  At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, I'll be a regular.",

    "text": "It pains me to read anything even slightly negative about this place. It is about as close to authentic Mexican food as you can get without the risk of stray bullet shots from the Cartel. That is why I go there - not for the ambiance or the decor - but for the raw Mexican deliciousness that is the burrito. One guy speaks competent English, everyone else is laser focused on wrapping up your choice burrito in under 3 minutes. It is a Fiesta Flavor Factory.  For the size and taste of these burritos I would easily spend $10 a pop. I usually pay about $8 because I throw in a few dollars tip. Why do I throw in a big tip? Well, these authentic chefs probably don't get paid much, but they sure do make my day when I walk in and leave within 3 minutes with a burrito the size of Mark McGwires forearm in my grasp - they earned that extra few dollars. God bless each one of them.  Some people complain about the quality of the meat - sorry, Bobby Flay! It's a fast food burrito stop. It is like walking into a bowling alley and talking smack about their furniture. C'mon Brendan Dassey, use your logic. If you want super high quality meat's go up to AJ's fine foods and pay $16 for a nice 4 oz organic chicken breast. If you want a monster burrito you're going to dream about until the next one, then man up and stop being a little girl. To the guy who whined about there not being enough salt: ummm, it's a burrito, if there is not enough salt for you maybe you should re-evaluate your diet and stop beer bonging soy sauce.  Lastly, as I conclude my rant in defense of the magnificence that is Fiesta Burrito, I go here to feel the best I can about a bad diet decision. It's my favorite cheat meal. It is a brilliant place to eat quickly at an affordable price, so don't listen to the haters, just go get your burrito on, would ya?",

Sometimes you have to tell them what you want in it.  The 1st time I went there, they simply made me a veggie burrito with beans, rice, lettuce, etc and it was awesome.  On several other occasions, they ask me what I want in it.  On another occasion, the rice was left out altogether, so was not as good in my opinion.  This is a little odd, but no big deal.  Just be sure to tell them what you want in it.  Tacos and burritos are typical offerings, and all tasty.  I have had many items and was always pleased and satisfied.    The service and portions are a somewhat inconsistent.  It is difficult to predict what experience you might have on any given day.  Some counter servers are nice.  Some are not so nice.  None are outright rude or anything like that.   They have a drive thru that is pretty quick - I have used it at least 10 times.  The place gets very busy and parking lot is tiny.  I have seen the drive thru line to where you are in the street waiting to get into the parking lot.  And it is often tough to get a spot in the lot.  But you can always park a couple doors down at Bosa Donut and walk up to Fiesta, and then get an apple fritter for dessert ... bonus!",

Today, however, that changed when I realized It was 12 am and I had still not eaten dinner.   After a quick Yelp to determine which restaurants were still open, I settled on Fiesta Burrito bc of the strong reviews. A breakfast burrito is what I craved, and this place delivered. Double bacon, potato, egg, and cheese. It was fast. The bacon was real bacon, unlike some of the burrito joints that fake the bacon w burnt spiral cut ham. The cashier was friendly and made sure i left with enough hot sauce, an absolute necessity in my world. Also, 7$ for a double meat burro was a price I appreciate.   I'm adding this place to my regular rotation.",

First, the burrito was bland.  Not much flavor at all.  Second, the salsas are disappointing - super watery and very little flavor.  You can't have a great burrito without great salsa.  One point deduction for the salsa fail.  Finally, there was too much tortilla, not enough filling.  I get they want to keep the price low, and that's fine, but don't use such a big tortilla if you're not going to fill it.  Another point deducted for the underfilled tortilla.  Overall, not worth the longish drive out from Paradise Valley.",

I took a star away for how stingey they are with their salsa, they're literally the worst about it out of all the Mexican places I've been to.  I feel like I have to barter for salsa at the window. Or you ask for 8 greens they say OK and there's only 3 when you get home. It says clearly on their window that they charge for extra salsa, which is tacky but fine, I'll pay extra to enjoy my food the way I want it and I always make sure I ask BEFORE I give them payment so that they still have the option to charge me. Still I trust them (even tip them to show appreciation for getting hooked up on the salsa front) and get home to a disappointing amount of salsa to go with my food. I took another star away for being charged extra for something I didn't order once and not noticing until I pulled an extra burrito out of my to go bag, and for being charged for sides of sour cream that I never got twice. Great food, but check your order and your receipt before driving happily home to enjoy.",

The two-burrito combinations are an awesome deal.  I like that their chicken is slow cooked and falls apart; it is not greasy. They fill their tacos and burritos with a good portion of chicken.  Their carne asada is good quality and lean.  In the carne asada plate, they serve a few big slices, and in the tacos it's chopped; you won't get a lot of chopped pieces of fat; maybe one or two, it's quite lean.  If you're hungry for a taco, but also want a bit of beans, order a tostada.  The burrito mixta has machaca beef, beans, and green chiles. It's excellent.",

Yes, it's a basic burrito/taco joint, but the quality of its food is definitely above many of its competitors.   My first selection was a chicken taco. Didn't really expect much. I was delighted to receive a taco stuffed with shredded white chicken, not the \"are you sure this is chicken?\" mixture you sometimes receive elsewhere. The chicken wasn't really that well seasoned, but you can spice to taste with a salsa bar that is stocked with red sauce, green sauce and veggies. The menu has a lot of variety, much more than the establishment's name would imply. Burritos, tacos, tortas, enchiladas, tostadas, chimichangas, quesadillas... and great combination plates priced mostly around seven dollars.   The dining room is minimal, in both size and decor, just as it should be. There is a shaded outdoor patio with additional seating.  The staff is friendly and food is quickly prepared. There is also a drive thru. Located near SkySong, Fiesta Burrito is wedged in among some other restaurants, fast food and otherwise. Open for breakfast and late night.",

Any of these selections are guaranteed to keep you full for at least ten hours.

I like the rolled tacos, as well.  My companion on a recent visit ordered the \"rolled tacos supreme\" (where they pile carne asada and other stuff on top of 5 rolled tacos).  Wow, I'd never noticed that before...can I try one?  In a word, awesome.  Not very practical to eat, but really yummy.

I ordered the rolled taco's w/ guac and a carne asada burrito. I was blown away.....no carne asada fries?? That's a staple back home!!!  The burrito was pretty big and had tons of carne asada packed in there, the rolled taco's had a good amount of guac on em but skimpy on the cheese. Also this did cost a little more than what I'm used to paying back at home. I guess if I need a Mexican fix and I'm out in AZ I'll come back but other than that I'll be glad to go home to Alerto's, Los Alazanes, and Taqueria de Anda for some Carne Asada Fries.",

Everything about this place was a disappointment, even the prices which I thought were actually high for a hole-in-the-wall that you have to look hard to find.    Do yourself a favor and get a carne asada somewhere else.",

Most burritos are in the 3-dollar range, and you can't beat the quality for the price.  The chicken burrito incorporated medium spicy shredded chicken done just right, and the breakfast burrito used eggs, ham, cheese, onions, and green peppers to get it done.  Breakfast served all-day!  I know other Mexican restaurants do the same, but given the fact Fiesta Burrito is tantalizingly tasty, it just sweetens the deal.  Great Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce at the condiment bar!  Need I say more?  :::::CONS:::::  None.  Fiesta Burrito is nice and bright on the inside, and so seemed it's staff.  I believe the crew were truly enjoying themselves the day I went in and the smile on the man's face while washing the floor was refreshingly genuine and sincere.  Its obvious that its a well-run establishment, but its also one of those places that makes me wonder because the food IS so cheap...  Seriously.  How can places like J in the Box and McD's sell Chicken Sammies for a buck?  And the three dollar burrito?  I just can't see the profit margin...  But then again, I've never run a restaurant.  I mean - Fiesta's ingredients can't be that cheap, right???  Regardless, Fiesta Burrito is great bargain, and the food that I've tried so far knocked my socks clean off.  Check it out.",

At some point, the quality had dropped far enough that we hit Fiesta Burrito. My sister had been lauding this place for years.  Well, it is not only my favorite drive-thru/semi-fast Mexican food spot, it's one of my favorite value places in town. Cheap great food super quick. It's already kind of a stand by for me & the kids when the Mrs. does a girls night out. Also open quite late which is a major bonus (as both of my other cheap Mexican favorites have limited hours - Carolina's & Rito's).  Their food is excellent. Super tasty, reasonable, quick. Nice clean atmosphere, super friendly staff.  I typically go with the taco combination as they do the deep fried shredded beef tacos that are so yummy. Their carne asada is also brilliant. Great beans. They have a nice salsa bar as well. The Mrs. likes the green & red chile quite well too.  Can't miss with Fiesta Burrito.",

Fiesta Burrito was a great choice; thank you yelp!  I ordered the machaca plate, no. 11. A generous helping of machaca with egg, onions, peppers, cheese, and rice and beans on the side. A flour tortilla to scoop it all up with, some fresh pico de gallo and salsa verde from the salsa bar and I was set for a great lunch.  The food was great and inexpensive. The service was friendly and the location was very clean.   They have a big menu with several combination plates, all with rice and beans, breakfast food served all day, and some great a la carte options if you don't want the full meal.  Compared to other drive-through/quick order Mexican food places around, my meal here was comparable to Carolina's. That's the highest praise I can think to give a place like this.  I'll definitely be back.",

Used the drive-thru so I can't comment on the cleanliness. Nice tip jar hanging on the drive thru window *eyeroll*. I honestly don't have a problem with tipping. However, do we tip at taco bell? No. Or do we? Yet? Urg.  The bean and cheese burrito was runny and salty. Their hot sauce was watery and not even close to hot - probably because it was mostly water. I also got their beef taco. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach. One bite and it was actually decent, but I was done, full. I wish I would have eaten the taco first and skipped the bean burrito. We all know you can't save a taco. It becomes a mushy mess - no ones fault but the nature of the taco.  Los Favoritos has them beat by FAR. If you're a fan of Fiesta Burrito, make the drive to LF and give it a try.  Btw, that new Post Office - clusterfuck.",

The customer service has always been bad, but I was able to overlook that when I enjoyed the food. Now, however, the food quality has gone down drastically. They used to have the best green salsa that I would always get to go with the burritos. They must have changed that recipe...one part salsa with 3 parts water? Its awful!! Their rolled tacos are pretty much taquitos that you buy at the grocery store in the frozen foods.   The customer service is nonexistent! I always go through the drive-thru and every time I order and all they say is \"Thank You\"...no \"pull around\", no total, no repeating of the order for any mistakes. It's extremely awkward!! Then when you actually encounter humans the awkwardness increases tenfold when there is still no talking except to ask if you want the watery salsa, and to tell you the price (which changes EVERY TIME you go there, even if its twice in two days!). Fiesta I used to brag about you to all my friends, now I think the only person I would tell is my worst enemy so I could laugh about the awkwardness they will go through interacting with your restaurant.",

It had to be a bean burrito.   I made myself fresh tortillas for this purpose alone but I realized we didn't have any beans!! Frantically I called my grandma to ask if she had some and she said she just ran out. I didn't have all day to make fresh beans. I wanted a burrito now!  So finally I sucked it up and drove down the road to fiesta burrito. I thought to myself that as long as it was better than Taco Bell, I'd be able to satisfy my craving.  FOUR BUCKS FOR A DRIVE THROUGH BEAN BURRITO!?  I thought to myself that this was kind of expensive but I got it anyways. After all, I needed a burrito. What I got was worth it's weight in mexican gold.  What I was given was the biggest burrito that I'd ever seen in my life. Seriously this burrito could have ended me if it chose to. It was the best bean burrito that I'd ever had. Maybe even more than my grandmas homemade ones. I can't even begin to describe the joy I felt while eating this thing. I couldn't even eat half of it in one sitting. It actually became THREE separate meals for me. Each time I reheated it, it was still just as good as the first.

Guess, they just call it food. \"Pause for laughter\" Anyways, I tried this place once...too authentic for me but it was good! Its one of those places I spoke about. The washed out pics (cause you don't need to see them: Main theme rice, beans, some kind of meat), original spanish names for the dish, and drive thru...yes the mexican food drive thru! I love it. This places gets 4 stars because it didn't pass the health inspection report, but I still eat there despite. That's good food.",

We stayed a couple of nights at the 3 Palms and ended up having breakfast here and satisfying a late night munchies craving.    As stated in other reviews, this place is VERY clean. N Ot to say other places are not, but you don't feel like you are in a sleazy taco joint with questionable sanitary practices.  We both had a simple breakfast burrito for lunch.  While it was nothing to write home about, it was tasty and filling.  Our late night snack was a big time pleaser!  Had a few tacos and and an order of the rolled tacos with guacamole.  Perfect!  Would eat that same order for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  If you are in that neck of the woods, drop in and order up some good Mexican fast food!",

Stay away from the rolled tacos as they're absolutely flavorless and the guacamole is very subpar or at least it was tonight!  California Burrito with Carne Asada was good, it just would've been nice to have salsa.  Again very hit or miss!  I go here as it's in my area!  Note to self, check bag before driving off",

Wouldn't be an issue if they didn't overload the to-go bag with a bunch of red sauce and only a few green. The red sauce, although good, can only be used quite sparingly as it's pretty spicy. My only suggestion is to lessen up the spice in the red sauce so it's palatable. Put it this way; if the only thing I am complaining about is that I can't handle the red sauce, it means the place is pretty good. Definitely one of the best taco shops in the city.",

Yes the portions are big but more food doesn't mean better. I rather have a smaller portion with some genuine Mexican food taste. The carne asada has no type of flavor. Meat looks discolored or something and has just a bland taste that honestly if it wasn't for the guacamole I probably would have thrown my burrito away. I have seriously thought about opening my own Mexican Taqueria because unfortunately these places are just like the rest. Filiberto's, Julioberto's or any other Bertos in PHX. I can honestly say that Street tacos fair a lot better but not by a lot. What I've noticed is that all these places get cheap meat and ingredients to cut down on cost but the quality of the food is what suffers. The one star was for the guacamole which I can also make better myself but helped the burrito survive as I was hungry and beggars can't be choosers. Also real Mexican food doesn't have yellow cheese. You might as well go to Taco Bell. Shame on you and any place using yellow cheese.",

OK, I really just want to put it on my mouth, but in a really sexy way.   This review might say more about my sex life than a burrito, but really drive to Fiesta immediately & get one. It's will be the best bean burrito you've ever eaten. If you disagree with me, then you should drive to Taco Bell for all your bean burrito needs. Your palette is obviously not refined enough for Fiesta Burrito.  Yeah they have a whole other menu of other stuff too, but why would I bother, when I can get a bean and cheese burrito?",

My first clue that this place would be better than the average was seeing the fire truck and ambulance parked outside. Firefighters are typically great cooks, and if they are eating at a place, it is a great sign.  My most recent visit, I was hungry, in a hurry, and wanted something tasty. I was in the area and hit Fiesta Burrito. I got a carne asada burro and a plain cheese crisp. Even though the line of cars was six deep, the line moved smoothly and before I knew it, I was paying for my lunch.  Getting back to the office, I was pleased to discover a tasty burro and the cheese crisp was very good. Please note, this is not America's or Gallo, but it is good in a pinch. As a bonus, you're eating at a place called 'Party Burrito'! How can you lose?  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.",

They also have decent tacos and yummy rice and beans. If you don't catch them when they are busy) you don't always get the freshest ingredients, as in sometimes I have had stale chips, or the meat wasn't as good as it usually is...... so try hitting this place during the normal B,L and D time rush. Also if you're looking for a late night snack, this place is open 24/7 so being able to stuff your face with pretty decent Mexican Food, is better than no food at all :) I have to say I will keep visiting Fiesta Burrito rather than their competition! They are better than FillyB's and close to my bf house! Alway a plus when we feel like grabbing something quick! I just wish they would stop being delicious sometimes and meh the next! Consistency is nice!",

They are not very friendly, if you ask for a certain number of their watered down sauce, they rolled their eyes. When you give your debit card, they act like they wanted cash. The food is not that great for such lousy service. Too many burrito places that would love the business. Last time I will be going there. Parking lot was empty at the time, maybe other people share the same feeling as I do. Employees need to remember, it's the company that cuts the check, but the customer who pays you.

My boyfriend lived in LA for 10 years (known for excellent food) and he is living there temporarily right now. He says the carne asada burrito is the best he has ever had anywhere. One day he flew back home and when I picked him up from the airport at 10pm he asked to go to Fiesta Burrito. The last time he came back he drove from LA and stopped at Fiesta before even coming to see me and I only see him two weekends per month!  I don't eat beef so my favorite is the adobada burrito. They also have the best refried beans I have had in many years.   Be careful if you go - because you will want to go back again and again. I liked the guys review about running the marathon and wanting to stop. My boyfriend would have been right there with you!!!",

The burrito is loaded which shredded chicken, generous helpings but they are a bit stingy with the potatoes and pico de gallo. salsa is very watered down especially the green one, the red is a little better and spicier be sure to ask for extra.

This place is great for exactly what it is, my husband and I love the bacon and egg with cheese breakfast burrito. The bacon is cut up so it's incorporated into every bit. I used to order the sausage, egg and cheese but found I liked the bacon better.   I also like their traditional breakfast burrito that comes with shredded pork, pick de Gallo, egg and cheese but it doesn't keep for too long since the pick de gallo can make the tortilla soggy if it sits too long.   My family from Chicago have gotten their enchiladas and really liked them. I'm picky about those but they were pretty good if you have a craving. Loved their refried beans. Their rolled tacos are also excellent.   If we do dinner I order the carne asada burrito with guacamole. It's my go-to at places like this, that and shredded beef tacos.   The breakfast burritos aren't greasy but other items like shredded beef tacos are. Its just part of anyplace like this, Fiesta isn't overly greased by any means.",

Instead, I had one enchilada and one taco with rice and beans. I had a difficult time differentiating between the taco and the enchilada. Either because my taco had become so soft the way it was packaged into the container or because they were basically the same thing and everything just tastes the same?   I don't know, it wasn't great. It did not cure my craving for enchiladas but reminded me of why I haven't gone here more frequently. I guess it's just not the same type of Mexican food I'm used to.",

The ONLY thing I would change about this place is the order that they stack ingredients on entrees. Everyone knows that cheese goes on hot items like chips and rolled tacos FIRST and then other toppings like guacamole and sour cream. This is so the cheese will melt and provide a layer to keep moisture from toppings from seeping in to chips and other crunchy items and keep them from getting soggy. For example rolled tacos, then cheese, then guacamole. This is the only thing keeping Fiesta Burrito from a five star review.    They are open late  They are fast  They are friendly   They are clean  They stack ingredients in entrees in a way that allows them to become soggy",

It resembles other \"Berto\"-style establishments,  which are fast food type Mexican fare. The staff is friendly,  and the older gentleman at the front always knows it is me by my order. They are also PD friendly, which is a plus.  The restaurant inside is clean. There is a small salsa bar that is never empty. I have never used the bathroom, so I can't vouch for that. Sometimes the parking lot van get difficult. There aren't many spots,  and sometimes the line at the drive through can block other traffic through the lot. The drive through goes pretty fast, so it is never a problem for long.   The food is always hot and fresh. I have had breakfast, country, bean and cheese and Chile relleno burritos. I also have gotten macho fries, super nachos, chicken tacos, rice, beans and rolled tacos (taquitos).  They have agua fresca as well as sodas. I normally get a jamaica. I have liked everything here. The prices are fairly inexpensive.  If you are in a hurry, are headed home from the club or just want a good lunch for a good price, give Fiesta a try.",

I really enjoyed the Rice as well.  Their Pico is really onion heavy, but it balances well with the food. I also like their Green Salsa.  I will say, I'm not sure if their beans or rice are vegetarian. I'm sort of \"if I don't have to chew it, I don't know it is there\" vegetarian, so enter with caution if you aren't this way.

A side of sour cream is a necessity with the adobada burrito and they give you a good portion for the price. I also like lots of pico and they have a big container of it inside at the salsa bar.  The machaca plate with egg (#11) is my second favorite. I always use the accompanying tortilla to make my own burrito, plus I get the rice and beans on the side. Yum.  The quesadilla supreme is also very good, but I would recommend eating it with a fork and knife, they really load it up.  Overall, I have never had anything bad from Fiesta and the staff is always super friendly. Plus there's a drive-thru. Awesome!",

They just kept giving altitude and rolling there eyes. At one point we can hear them comment in the back saying racial slurs in spanish since were mexican also. I just cant go back if they are prejudice and homophopic and if thats how they run business then we're jusy going to take our business else where.  Update-went again to get something to drink since it was hot and too see if they changed but guess not So I talked about fiasta burrito before but damn man dont go at night for drinks. Just went to get a small horchata and a large and the guy end up giving me 2 large which isn't a big deal but then before I took off I noticed one was purple so I went back literally seconds later pretty much went around the restaurant still in there parking lot and the guy was like \"what do you want\"(really man) and I said \"hey man I asked for 2 horchatas and he went on the offense and said \"NO YOU SAID 1 HORCHATA AND 1 JAMAICA LOOK AT YOUR RECEIPT\". then I went um no 1st I asked for 1 large and 1 small and you end giving me two large with no receipt which I dont mind but you didn't give two horchatas and then he went on by okay but I need to charge you and I said wth why i didn't ask for that order then he was like fine pull up and he end giving me my drink but with the craziest altitude. I was more shocked then mad like wtf man it was the easiest order ever and I didn't snap at him or get mad. Idk why he was so mad",

The best items I've had are the breakfast burritos, they actually are pretty good and available all day.  My biggest issue with this place is the meat. When you order something with meat on it, they do put a lot on there but, its just not that good. The chicken is always tough, stringy and chewy. The carnitas is an odd consistency, more like chipped beef, not like the shredded/pulled pork consistency it should be and its very greasy. The carne asada is tough but the best meat option (besides the bacon) in my opinion.  The pico de gallo is mostly cilantro, way too much for my tastes but if you like cilantro you'll love their pico.",

The weekends get a little busy with the National Guard base soldiers out to eat, but it's worth the wait! I wouldn't recommend a plain bean and cheese burrito as it's very flavorless. Parking is ample with Pepsi products on the fountain!",

Carne asada had almost no flavor or char (appeared to be boiled? Yuck!) Which they attempted to mask with guac and pico. Beans and rice were sub par and bland as well. Meal came out in the time it took to fill my soda, which isn't a good sign.   If you want good, quality, flavorful Mexican food look elsewhere. The only real positive is that it was fast and inexpensive. I won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Best drive through Mexican food in Scottsdale. I go out of my way for this place. I used to live down the street from this little gem. I would pass by everyday and assume that it was. A typical burrito stand serving mostly stomach aches and loose stools. One (late) evening on the way home from old town we stopped for something to soak up the bourbon. What happened that night was magical. This would be no one night (burrito) stand.  Fiesta burrito, translation: party of meat, beans, and rice in a blanket, is in fact, amazing.  It servers your very typical Mexican food. Burritos of all sorts, rolled tacos, etc. The difference is that deist prepares things freshly and they do it well.  I now live ~ 20 miles from fiesta. Thankfully I work one day a week in Tempe and go out of my way on the ride home to stop by.  My favorites:  The breakfast burritos: I usually go for the sausage and egg but they are all great. Simple and made fresh.  The carnitas burrito. My cracking. Juicy pork with pico and guac. Hits the spot every time.  The carne asada burrito. Much better than other places I have found around Phoenix. Spicy and savory.  Rolled tacos. Not sure why these are particularly good here but I think it is the Fuad they put on top.  A few months ago at the 5th mile of the of the of changs half marathon, which ran right down McDowell  I almost stopped running to get a burrito. Only the fact that I had no money and the fear of a burrito belly for the next 8 miles kept me going. Next time I'm stopping.",

I found it very bland. It did fill the purpose for which I came here, but compared to some awesome Mexican food that I have had in this so-close-to-Mexico-state - this place was far from note worthy.  It's not expensive, which is the factor that saves this place - but I find the fast food angle of Mexican food incredibly tacky. And the seating arrangement is purposely very small. It is clear that the model is enter-pay-eat-gtfo, and I have no issue with that - but I don't see this as something that I want.  One could compare this to a Mexican franchise, something that in itself is a hilarious strangeness when one is living with so many actual Mexican that can cook amazing things out of mystery meat, lard, flour and chili.",

I must've driven by this place 1000 times and I've never noticed it....I'm glad Yelp guided me here.  It was a Saturday and the place was kind of busy.  After browsing the extensive menu on the wall, I decided to order:  Carne Asada Burrito, $4.15 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=EwvshZHDNmhTyCwYd2NMGA#EwvshZHDNmhTyCwYd2NMGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fies...</a>  Bean and Cheese Burrito, $2.75 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=tKBbSicI8f2ZuXeBOTzN_w#tKBbSicI8f2ZuXeBOTzN_w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fies...</a>  While I was waiting for my food, I mozied over to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of Salsa.  I give their Salsa Bar 2 Stars...because they only have the runny Green & Red Sauces, Pickled Veggies, and Pico de Gallo.  There's no chunky Salsa or really hot Salsa available.....the runny Green and Red options are very mild. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=rlP4WQj7r8ZXiB0bz7zRSw#rlP4WQj7r8ZXiB0bz7zRSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fies...</a>  After a short wait, my Burritos were ready.  I went for the Carne Asada first.  I took one bite and fell in love with it...it's a little different than most places like this in that they have Potatoes in the Burrito.  The Potatoes and Carne Asada create a unique flavor that tastes very good....kudos to them for putting this together!  Next was the Bean & Cheese Burrito....that too was very good.  Overall, the food here is 4 Stars...it's that good.  The lack of a hot Salsa option drops it down to 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up because I think they deserve it.  Return Factor - 90%",

Chicken was nice and tender but the beans was what got me it was cooked perfect most places are always undercooked. Next time I'm in the area again I'll be sure to be back.",

If you live in or around Old Town, you need to get yourself a late night burrito from this place pronto. Although, if you don't know about it yet, I'm not really sure I can get on board with your life choices thus far. Who are you?",

    "text": "This is my go-to place for quick breakfast burritos. I either get the standard with eggs, ham, cheese and pico or the machaca with shredded beef, eggs, and cheese. Both come with sides of red or green sauce. The tortillas have a nice texture and all of the ingredients are cooked together for an overall great distribution of egg:cheese:meat. They'll even toss potatoes in the mix if you ask.   Watch out because these burritos are hot and tend to leak just a tad. They're big too, so you only need one. Check these guys out next time you're sobering up from a long night or if you're craving one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had.   They offer drive-thru and sit down. If you eat inside, they have a small salsa bar.",

I ordered the 4 rolled tacos with guac and had a great meal overall.  Expect large portions, good prices and authentic offerings.  With a good Mexican cerveza the experience would have been even better (I guess I have to go for take-out next time to get the cerveza myself)",

I did not eat the enchilada but I did really enjoy the burrito and some of the beans.  Really... you cannot beat this price $5.83!!!  The burrito had shredded beef, a little bit of green peppers and I think I saw little pieces of potato, it was very tasty!  I would definitely come back here again.",

First time I went I ordered way too much...two tacos and a burrito, i finished probably half.  The burrito was ginormous.  The second time I went with  my girlfriend and ordered 2 enchiladas.  The enchiladas were cheap (like under 4 bucks) and good.    The people at this establishment are very nice as well.  Order lightly, the portions are huge.   Nice hole in the wall.
