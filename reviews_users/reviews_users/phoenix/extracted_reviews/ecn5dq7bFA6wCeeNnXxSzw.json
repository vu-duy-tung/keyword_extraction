Unfortunately I think everyone has caught on since the lunch hour seems to be pretty empty.. Unlike before when you had to wait forever to order AND get a seat.  Hopefully they'll change it back..",

    "text": "Decided to go there last night so I went online to place our to-go order.  Soon discovered that you cannot order certain things online even though they are offered on the menu therefore I just called the restaurant and placed the order, to be picked up at 5:50pm.  The girl that took my order explained that they were still working through the online system and hopefully you will be able to order everything soon.  She read my order back to me and it was correct.  I arrived at 5:50 to pick up our order and the young man read everything back to me again, just as I had ordered it.  He told me that it would take about 5-10 minutes to put my order together.  Ok, I'm assuming they don't prepare the dishes until you arrive so that it will be nice and fresh.  I'm fine with that. About that same amount of time passed and they showed up with my bag of food.  As I was preparing to walk out the door, a server stopped me to tell me that we were missing our 6 rolls that had been ordered and it would be a few minutes because they have to be made from scratch.  A little confused now since they were in the order and everyone knew it but again, I sat and waited.  In about 5 minutes the young man brought me a tray with 3 rolls and said \"here you go - have a nice evening\".  I looked at him and said where are the other 3, I ordered 6?  A look of confusion came over his face, he went back to the young lady (who I assume was the mgr on duty), told her and she asked someone to make another order.  She came back to me, apologized and asked if there was anything else she could get for us, nope just the rolls was my answer.  This took about another 10 minutes.   Now, she did apologize for all the delays and gave me a gift card to use and the food was good.  Service was really poor.  I don't understand how two people can read your order off to you and then the kitchen can't get it made.  In my estimation, I must have waited until at least 6:15 until we received our full order of food.   I'm hoping they were just having a bad night but they do need to work some bugs out of their online ordering system.",

    "text": "I thought the old Pei Wei was okay, but didnt fully appreciate its subtle virtues until we walked in today. Sheesh. They removed all the comfy booths in favor of regimented food court tables, reduced the overall seating area, downgraded the condiment and self serve drink stations, replaced chinaware with plastic shells reminiscent of Kids Cuisine tv dinners. The whole thing is depressing.   The food is worse than before - at least mine was - and as others have mentioned the portions have gone on a crash diet.  Healthy upgrade, s'ppose, since my tongue informs me they've piled even more sugar and salt into their sauces - if that's possible.  The limited menu is a little cheaper, I think, but doesnt approach the variety, appeal or value Pei Wei built its rather middle of the road reputation on.   My bill was also screwed up. At least twice. First, they quoted the wrong remaining balance on my debit card, so I had them void the transaction and bill to another card, at which point they charged me for a phantom drink.  The manager wasnt able to credit that, so voided the entire sale again and billed me a third time. I now have three receipts.   It'll get straightened out  and I have no problem whatever with the girl in front, or anyone who works there. But these systematic, abrupt downgrades scream customer indifference....you can almost hear the sneering boardroom banter all the way from Manhattan.",

Sort of like McDonalds.  Servers who deliver your food to the table are no longer. No one  is clearing off empty dishes or asking if they can get you anything.  Heck, even Dairy Queen will bring out the Blizzard to your table on occasion.  At Pei Wei's you're on your own now, buddy!      What happened to the nice china plates and silverware.  Now it is plastic boats for the food and cardboard (huh) boxes for the salads.   Menu has changed to what seems like smaller portions. My buddy's favorite sweet and sour soup is gone.  In fact Pei Wei's has no soups now.  The Pei Wei spicy beef was still good if somewhat vinegary.  Difficult to eat the side salad from the small cardboard box.  Granted the remodel makes for an attractive space!  But it's now just open seating, sort of like mall eateries.  Music was irritating too.    I don't think this place will appeal to older folks. Previously Pei Wei was 5 star for me but now I'll think twice about eating here.  I like Sauce, down the street a whole lot better, as in better caring service!",

And the portions...maybe about half as much as what you'd get at a normal Pei Wei and at what seemed like a higher price than before.  I paid $10.33 for Mongolian Beef w/ Noodles and no drink, just a water cup, only for it to show up in a plastic container on a tray like I had just grabbed a meal at a hospital cafeteria.  And it's not like they brought it out to me either;  had to disrupt my lunch conversation (which I was only half listening to because I was listening for my number to be called) to go pick up my child-sized portion of food.    I love Pei Wei but definitely not ever going back to this one.",

Again,.. where did line form asking for \"Somebody please bring us Asian Sandwiches\"? They lack taste and are served on \"bread\" the consistency and taste of cardboard, swing and a BIG miss!  Positives: The surviving six dishes from the Diner model are still awesome,. just served in micro-portions, get two they're small!  I want my old school Pei Wei back!   PS - P. Fleming, did you think to ask any \"customers\" about your new ideas?  Lost without my Pei Wei,....",

It's Asian food from a chain so don't expect to be blown away but is this really why anyone goes here? It's consistent as you can get and doesn't break the bank for a good portion of food that can also be relatively healthy.  My only qualm with Wei is that many of the dishes taste alike. Whether I get the Thai Dynamite or the Spicy Korean the flavors, spices don't vary that much - both are still decent dishes though.  At 878 walkable yards from our place it's the closest Asian food takeout we have and I am ok with that.",

Our food came out without any issues, piping hot and tasty, as usual.   We were offered to-go cups in case we wanted one for the road and because we were the last people there, the extra chocolate chip cookies from the day went home with us, free of charge!

We sat down and ate and when we were finished we both had leftovers. Usually at other locations, the employees come and check on you and give you a box. This was not the case here. We sat for almost an hour and no one ever came. We were fine just talking there anyways, but when we were ready to go I went and grabbed my own containers from the counter.

Pei Wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is.   For a long time before the airlines went insane over carry on, i used to bring a Pei Wei kids meal as my personal upgrade. It's small, well packed, and used to make the other passengers jealous.   I don't go to Pei Wei so much anymore. Long lines and inadequate service keep me from venturing in their door on any whim. I will order ahead and pick up. They rarely get my order right, but whatever i get usually tastes pretty good. I just never go with the expectation that I will get my correct order.",

Do I bypass the rail in the middle of the floor? Oh wait, there's the menu on the wall to the side. I only noticed it because I saw the to go menu first and I was reaching for that. I guess he was the Manager? He wasn't wearing all black like the others, he waited for a few minutes but I had NO CLUE what to order so I just let him wait by staying back from the counter. He didn't say anthing to me, just stood there than finally went to clean or something. When I finally decided on Dan Dan Noodles (from a review here) and 2 pork egg rolls. I felt like a robot might have been more personal than the Manager who took my order. I didn't even get a Hi. Just: For here or to go?  I got a water with my meal and it was a seperate machine. I'm saying this because it took a few minutes for my meal to arrive, and by that time I had one lonely ice in my cup. The water isn't just room temp - it was closer to warm! I filled my cup half way with ice. WTH?  The young man who brought my food was the only nice thing about the place. He smiled, told me my egg rolls will just be a minute and left.  The Food. Minced chicken basically means ground chicken. For some reason it doesn't look appetizing. On the menu it had a little red flame next to the name of the dish indicating Spicy. It barely was! Is their spicy just pepper?? Wheres the heat?! Half way through my meal I realized what the dish tasted like. A plain version of the turkey spaghetti I made a couple weeks ago. Only mine was better and it had tomato taste to it. I pushed the bowl away so disappointed. If you saw me sitting there you saw me shake my head every few minutes because it was just...blah!  I was a bit excited about the pork egg rolls, the hot mustard it was served with was a bit odd but okay, I'll try it. The first egg roll was pretty good - I've had better - the hot mustard sauce was okay. The second egg roll after about 5 minutes it was sitting in grease, I wrapped it in my napkin to sop up the grease but saw the puddle under it and said nevermind. Pushed that away.  When I only eat half the meal, and NOT take the rest home - speaks volume. When I pushed the egg roll plate away, it bumped into the bowl and realized it was PLASTIC. LoL - I thought they were nice bowls but the \"clink\" of them bumping I realized they look similar to the dishes you find at the dollar store.  In all, my $11.02 didn't seem worth the meal I recieved. I won't be back.",

Plus the rolls are the smallest I've ever eaten.  My other orders were kids low mein meals with chicken. My daughter mentioned that it didn't have flavor.

But I'm currently waiting for an order they said would be ready 15 minutes ago! I suppose I should avoid Pie Wei all together when on a timed lunch.",

I explained my case to the \"manager\" and he denied it and said \"if I wasn't happy, I can go to the other side of phoenix and have low quality food\". I didn't even receive my money back for something I didn't get and I left the store upset. I will be doing a follow up on this matter and I will never step foot into this place again.",

I feel like they take advantage of the fact that chances are slim you're going to bring back an order once you're home.  I was so hungry, I just decided to eat what I had even though it's no where near what I expected, or am used to.    I feel like either the cooks are new, or extremely incompetent!!  Tonight I ordered the Pei Wei spicy chicken with fried rice.  I've been ordering this dish for over a decade at other locations, as it's my favorite Pei Wei dish.  The chicken did not have the usual fried coating, or the sweet spicy sauce.  It's like I got an order of fried rice with chicken.  That's it.  So disappointed!",

No beef and broccoli - say what?! Luckily they had sweet and sour shrimp. However, it comes on a plastic plate with a plastic tray. You need to grab plastic utensils and drink from a plastic cup. Kind of wasteful if you ask me! Also, the portions were much smaller than before.  The inside is nice. It gives off a warehouse vibe - very clean and open with tons of wood and metal tables. We arrived at 11am and left by 11:20am. The service was super quick - granted we were the first customers of the day!   One of the employees told us that they were going to change back to a regular Pei Wei, since this Market concept wasn't doing so well. I hope they keep the redesign inside, but definitely go back to the standard menu.",

I told myself I'd give them one more try.   Ordered 2 entrees and an appetizer online this morning for an 11:30am pickup. Got there at 11:28, to be told they had no broccoli or snap peas for either entrees.   I was offered the option of mushrooms, scallions or onion. Really???  The 'kid' working my order said she just had to bag it up, and it would be ready.   At 11:45 - 15 minutes later - I finally went back to the register and asked someone else where my order was. It was sitting in a bag, that had been sitting there pretty much the whole time. I only figured it out, because people that had come in behind me, were being given their orders. WHO did they think the bag belonged to??? No one EVER paged my name. I was a mere 10 feet away, so I think I would have heard my named called.  Never again for this 'chain'.

Then we received our salads which were suppose to be the regular size but when they came out it had to of been small because it was tiny with only a few pieces of lettuce and few chicken pieces but ok np. I kindly asked if this was the small and they were like no that's the regular very sarcastically. There's no way that was the regular because any smaller would not have been worth purchasing .

Very unfortunate for us that we stopped in for more disappointment.   Tonight, we ordered dine in. Big mistake. We ordered chicken chow main, lettuce wraps and the teriyaki crunch roll. All the food was just terrible, even the service: the server dropped our serving spoon on the ground with part of the food from the plate and never returned.   The chicken in the lettuce wraps didn't have any green onions, or water chestnuts, and the lettuce was hot and wilted (brown rotten). There were some crumbs of dried \"something\" on it. Chicken?  Who knows.   When I inquired, they said they'd run out of their ground chicken mix for that dish and substituted. (What?, dirt). Then why offer it?  This is a big company that doesn't really care anymore. LAST time going here and my next generation agrees.    Unfortunately, they'll be out of business soon.  Maybe we'll try the \"before divorce\" PF Changs. Or, the Mandarin Buffet. 10x better with sushi and 1/2 the price. Still, you'll have no idea where the \"chicken\" comes from at either place.   Peiwei said they would refund the lettuce wraps, but it would take a few days for the refund.  So, they can charge you immediately, and immediately debit your bank account, but you have to wait for a refund.   They think you'll forget. I won't.   Craziness.",

Went there this evening just before closing, according to yelp, 9:30 but the actual time is 9:00 pm. Once inside I was waiting behind another person and the cashier was just laughing and talking to them for almost 8 mins. Once I get to the register he asked me if I was there to pick up and I said no I needed to place an order. That was when he told me \" umm sorry we are closed\" I replied no because I've been standing here for the last 10 mins and referenced the yelp listing hours.   There was another person that was behind me and she too was upset at the fact he was taking his sweet time and trying to turn the both of us away.   After everything I was able to place more order and left satisfied.  I just feel the staff could have handled things a little better and it would seem there needs to be a change to their hourly listing on Yelp.",

The beef was cooked in a wok, but it was overcooked IMO, very crisp, and dry. The salad dressing almost tasted like Italian. The flavor of the mangos got overwhelmed by the vinegary dressing. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't flavored like a typical Thai beef salad or papaya salad.   I'm seeing a pattern to Pei Wei. I like their wok items, but their Thai food doesn't hold up. I guess I don't appreciate fusion. The orange peel chicken gets 3 stars, the Thai Beef Salad was 2 stars. I will be generous since the service was pretty fast.",

When they run out of ingredients for a dish listed on the menu (has happened more than once) they don't bother letting you know, so it's a surprise when your order arrives or you get home to find something's missing. They're close by, but the convenience doesn't outweigh dealing with the inevitable glitches & often disappointing food. Best to pass until they get whatever's not working figured out.",

Quick service,  but not very friendly. ..no greeting, just waddya have?  All out of red wine, but that's okay they had white.  No exhibition kitchen bar seating?!?!? What?? Many other Pei Wei's have this and they service their customers just fine,  and it's fun to sit up there and watch the preparation. Food was just okay...typically the orange chicken is really good and the chicken chunks have been cut carefully to remove the excess \"junk\" before the fry....not here....whoever is cutting the chicken here is lazy and the result is a product that resembles what you would get at a one-off, struggling Chinese restaurant. Not the typical quality of Pei Wei that you would expect. Whole restaurant lacked pizazz and fun. Love Pei Wei as a chain,  but this one needs a little recharge/refocus.",

I have been interested in trying a Pei Wei for quite some time but I thought it would be the one at 67th and 101 for dinner rather than this one for lunch.  Miserable traffic, cramped parking, I drove right by the place.  But none of that is the restaurants fault.  I got there at 1PM on a Friday figuring the lunch rush would be clearing.  As I walked up to the order desk I spotted 3 different 2 person tables to choose from.  By the time I got my order placed, no one in front of me, all three were being used and the only one open was next to one occupied by a one pretty woman just over 1/2 my age.  I left my number and went off to fill my iced tea glass and in that 2 minutes she was gone and the table was already cleared for the next guest.  Drat, scared off another one.:-(  Over the next 25 minutes that I was there the dining area did indeed clear out some but not as much as I expected.  Between the open kitchen, the music and all the talking I thought the noise level was pretty high.  My meal took about 10 minutes to arrive which I think is about right.  I ordered the limited time offering of Thai mango chicken with white rice ($7.75) and an iced tea (soft drink $1.75).  It actually looked like the picture on the web site.  Slightly spicy on the hot side (about what I expected) but more syrupy on the sweet side than I would like.  Chains seem to like syrupy.  The servers were quick to bring dishes out without letting them sit and were keeping the tables cleaned off.  Overall I think it is slightly nicer and slightly more expensive than Panda Express.  I wouldn't balk at going there again if that is what was suggested.  If in the right part of town I would prefer to go to Wok n Stix for about the same overall quality and price, and it is locally owned.",

This review isn't really about the food but I love that you can now order sauces on the side and add extra veggies.   I wanted to give a shoutout to JayJay ( I'm not sure if that's his real name as I asked another employee and she said she didnt know his name but everyone calls him JayJay - super short hair and glasses). He was our cashier and super knowledgeable about the everything on the menu. My husband and I asked a lot of questions about sauces, the chicken wrap and so many others. He was super patient!   And then we came in again tonight (Tuesday) and I didn't catch her name but she's brunette with a long pony tail and has a tattoo covering her right forearm. I asked her questions about my honey chicken and vegetables and how it was such a small amount compared to last time and she offered to bring more vegetables. What a way to make someone's dining experience even better. Thank you for being so friendly !",

As far as the food goes, most everything is delish.  My personal fav is the crab wontons.  I'm seriously OBSESSED with these... they are nothing like the cream-cheese puffs found elsewhere, thank goodness!  They actually have CRAB in them!  I also like the orange chicken, thai curry, kung pao, and salads.  Not a huge fan of their pad thai, but there are so many other options that I hardly miss it.  I do miss the caramel chicken special... it was delicious, and I'm bummed it didn't make the permanent menu.   Pei Wei is an example of a chain done right - clean, quick, consistent and tasty.

    "text": "I've never considered myself a monster, but after tasting the snicker doodle and chocolate chip cookies at  Pei Wei  on Glendale and 7th Street - I've taken on a new personae.    I AM a cookie monster. Just crazy enough to live from cookie sheet to mouth. Forget about nutritiously balanced meals packed with varieties of fruits and vegetables in my other reviews - they're over-rated.   Needless to say, you probably expected to read a review of the food. Sorry, this is about cookies. I can't review the food. I still haven't eaten it. I have no appetite for it. The plate is sitting there staring at me.   My plan was to have a pinch of the cookies. Seriously, just a nibble. But in cookie monster world, there is no such thing as a pinch or a nibble and before I could stop myself cookies were gobbled up. Gone! Just crumbs everywhere.  The snicker doodle cookie was soft and perfectly baked with a generous topping of cinnamon brown sugar. Usually I'm not a fan of excess sugar but it worked for this one. What's more is - the doodle was stuffed! with bits of nuts I think. At first I thought pieces of dried fruit because the smell reminded me of apple pie.   The chocolate chip cookie was soft and perfectly baked with a generous amount of chips but not overkill so I enjoyed the taste of cookie in every scrumptious bite.  Most importantly, my hands were not oily after eating so the baker knows his / her sh*t about the science of recipe measurements. No wonder these were so damn good.  I hope to have more cookies as good as these next time. ! ! !  C O O K I E S  !  !  !",

I don't know how I could have been on hold for over 10 min.  Went to the location because there website was advertising if you buy an entree then you will receive a free new orange chicken bowl. I asked about that and the cashier said there was no such thing( even though it is clearly on the website as valid from 3/23-3/25z. Ended up ordering the mango chicken, it was ok.",

The seasons is on point their sushi are very poor with quality tho yelled we're on a budget. They most memorable moment was the curious hostess who helped bring out food to the table and even getting us condiments when asked.

Before I could ask her to confirm my very large and expensive order, she hung up on me. I tried calling back, and there was no answer (twice). When I arrived to pick up my food, I paid for it and was not told that there was an extra long wait, but I was asked to answer an online survey (and offered a cookie to do so - what?). At that point I noticed the huge line of people waiting for their food. Several walked out after asking for a refund. After 45 minutes, I was preparing to leave. Finally, our food was ready. The beef and chicken dishes were good, but the lettuce wraps don't have them same texture as they used to (lots of large pieces of mushroom, very little chicken). One other thing to note was that the cooks were working really hard to get everyone's food ready. They were wearing hats, but one had long hair, and it was not tucked up under the hat. Gross. Seems they need some better management to say the least.",

Don't get me wrong, I'm always trying to find a more authentic Chinese food place that is good but that has proven very difficult as most places I try are either bland or use poor quality meat. With Pei Wei, you know you're getting quality and flavor every time. It's pretty delicious and consistent which is nice when you're not in the mood to gamble on how good your lunch is going to be.  To me, this Pei Wei was just as good as the rest.  I do wish it was a dollar or two cheaper... Even just offering a cheaper soda combo deal during lunch hour would make me pretty happy.",

The underlying off taste of their chicken is actually consistent now. Basically tastes like it has gone bad or has repeatedly been microwaved. I am not sure if it is because Pei Wei is no longer part of PF Chang's or what but they def are buying cheaper quality meat to save money. I've been to this Pei Wei three times over the last couple months. I won't be going back. The only thing I can recommend at this point is an all veggie fried rice.",

They have a concept similar to a to go Asian restaurant however it is the same great Pei Wei entree's and taste.

Everyone at this location is super friendly. You can tell they enjoy their jobs and the atmosphere. This location is always clean I have never seen a dirty table nor have I ever had to wait for one. The only suggestion I have for this location is for to go. Every time i order a to go it is like they wait for me to get there to cook my order instead of having it ready by the promise time.

    "text": "We loved Pei Wei until last night. Other locations are good, but this particular Pei Wei location always seems to have problems ranging from a sewage backup to being short staffed to giving tiny portions. These are things we've noticed in the past three years, each time making us vow to not return to this store. Being forgiving people, we gave them another chance last night. NEVER EVER AGAIN!   When we arrived, there were only a few open tables and there was a long line--that was a positive sign. We were in line for About twenty minutes. When were ordering, we were told they were short-staffed...(red flag). My partner ordered the lettuce wraps and edamame. I had the honey seared chicken. I tried to order a soda, but was told the machine was broken. Fine; I had iced tea instead. The condiment station was a nasty mess and they were out of lemons and most everything else (red flag). We located three empty tables--all filthy, but hey they were busy and short staffed. While seated for a very long time, we observed the kitchen to be in chaos. My partner and I have both worked in the restaurant biz in the past and we could clearly see they were \"in the weeds\".   When her appetizer finally arrived, my partner shared a few edamame with me while we waited for the entrees. She noticed that the bowl the edamame came in was filthy with old food. The edamame covered it up and it wasn't until she had gotten to the last few that she saw the trough our slop was served in. YUCK!   When the waitress placed the honey seared chicken in front of me I asked her which was which and she didn't know. She then said \"they're busy back there and probably got them mixed up\". I let it go ( last time I ordered the regular to go and it was tiny--so tiny that once I opened the container at home and saw what they sold me, I actually weighed the chicken and called the store. I spoke with the manager at that time and was told the weight the chicken portion should be--mine was less than half. At that time, the manager voided my credit card transaction and assured me this was a one-time occurrence.) This time, the rest of the food was bland and the sauce on my chicken tasted different.   When we got home, my partner had to sit down in the bathroom for over 45 minutes. She was awakened two more times in the night with the same problem. She awoke and felt nauseous and had a fever. After a couple of hours this morning, the symptoms began to subside. She seems to be on the mend now.   I awoke this morning with nausea and a fever, which subsides around the same time as hers did.   We will NEVER EVER EVER eat at this Pei Wei again, and are probably not going to visit any of their other locations for a very long time.  Cassie B., don't bother with the canned response; from the other reviews and your replies to them, fixing the problem is not high on the priority list. I won't take the time to go online and fill out your form; this review should suffice. That and the report I filed on iwaspoisonedDOTcom",

    "text": "My brother always raves about Pei Wei and at times even drives out of his way to eat there. So, it pains me to write this review.  I ordered the Thai soup which sounded really good at first especially since I was feeling a little under the weather. The taste was unfortunately pretty bland and the only thing I saw Thai about it was a few basil leaves which also amazingly also had no flavor.....weird.  The entree I went with was the Supergreen Thai Coconut Curry subbing chicken for shrimp. The name of the dish is long in name, but short on flavor and salt yet again. In addition, even though there was a respectable amount of shrimp in the dish none of them were cooked properly (1 of them was mushy *BLECHHH GAG*). I decided to just take the shrimp home to finish cooking them which is sad because I had to pay extra for shrimp.  I did also try the crispy potstickers which were pretty good but overpriced imo (2 for $2.19). The dipping sauce was soy sauce based and at the same time tasted vinegary.  Customer service was decent and the potstickers were tasty so the only reasons I rated 2 stars.  Next time I'll have to ask my brother what he usually eats at PW. Apparently, i made some bad choices my first time round.  04/05/2017 Update of review......after I decided to try my leftovers I noticed the tell tale signs of food poisoning bubbling away in my stomach. So disappointing....I really wanted to like one of my brothers favorites. Unfortunately, it won't be one of mine anytime soon....dropping to 1 star.",

    "text": "Very very disappointed in this Pei Wei location. I ordered a meal for my family online, it included 3 entrees and two desserts. I got the Thai Donuts, which were not tossed in cinnamon or sugar, so they tasted like fried bread without any sweetness. The teriyaki chicken I received did not have sauce on top, it tasted like plain chicken and noodles. I ordered it for a 8:45pm pickup time because that was the soonest I could pickup the food, and I was expecting fresh food since I got there at 8:40 pm. But the food had clearly been sitting out for more than 15 minutes. Overall very disappointed in the quality of food from this Pei Wei. The reason I go to Pei Wei is because of the quality of food, and quality of service. This did not meet either.",

    "text": "I should preface this by saying I'm not the person who complains at restaurants, never, ever. From 15-27 I worked in the industry at every level imaginable. Point being, I understand the ins and outs; the often unforeseen difficulties and don't feel right complaining to the often underpaid and under appreciated employees. But WTF Pei Wei, I can't take anymore from this location!!!!!   I've been a loyal Pei Wei supporter for years and years. And now as a father, I love it even more because on top of the usually great food and value, my daughter regularly has leftovers for school lunch; score! However, in three years of frequenting this location 1-2 times per month, I have yet to have a single experience that wasn't somehow flawed. Generally, they are small issues but tonight was just too much.   -First, I waited for three people to be served in the phone in line, while two employees sat laughing and neither one tended to the growing line of dine in customers. (Ok, breath; the issue is out of the way early and the rest will be smooth sailing, right? No!)  -We go to place our order and learn that they are out of eggrolls and spring rolls. Really? How exactly do you run out of such common items at a large chain?   -next we proceed to the drinks. The sprite my daughter wanted was out. The coke I wanted was out. I asked if they could be refilled, only to be told immediately, coldly, and with no apology, they were out. As a former manager I understand food cost, unforeseen rushes, space etc. but to run out of coke and sprite????   -moving right along... our food arrives! As mentioned, my daughter likes the leftovers for school lunch. So, I always pay extra to get extra chicken in her dish. When it arrived there were a whopping SEVEN pieces of chicken. I politely asked the runner if that was extra chicken. Her response? \"Can I see your receipt\" she saw that I had paid for extra, and said\"well, that looks like extra to me.\" She's had the exact same dish for three years, I know what regular and extra chicken look like. And this, this was barely enough to qualify for regular chicken, let alone the extra I paid for.  -And now, just when I think things can't possibly get any worse comes the real kicker.  About halfway through dinner my daughter predictably needed to use the restroom. Both our bowls were half full. But if that didn't signify we were still there, I was certain that her school book, school papers and pen sitting on the table would have clearly signified we were still there. Yet upon returning to our table, a short 2-3 minutes tops, I watched as the same lady from earlier stacked our food, dishes and trash on top of one another. She  seemed more offended than anything by the fact we were still there. Gone for two minutes, food only half eaten, and a stack of school supplies...WHY IN HOLY HELL would she think we were done?!!!!? So much for finishing the meal I had paid to eat.   We live less than 90 seconds from this location and have been long time regulars for multiple times a month. Yet despite the proximity and general enjoyment of the Pei Wei chain, we will never return to this location. My business (or lack there of) will have no bearing on their success or failure, I get that. But after overlooking and righting off years of failures on their end, tonight was the giant final straw. There is zero accountability here, zero consistency in the product, and not even a facade of customer service.",

It says something then, when Pei Wei (which is quite a bit more affordable) uses the same ingredients. It seems like they take a little less time with presentation or garnishes and just do the bulk of the meal and have someone run like hell to get it out to you.   The staff is good but seem overstretched at times. On one occassion, I had gone to get a refill and my girlfriend had stepped away from the table for one reason or another as well and they threw away our food, which was about half finished. I mentioned it to the busboy and within minutes they had fired full to-go orders of both (since obviously we'd have some left over) and the manager was at the table apologizing. In the end, it was impressive.  Last thing, I'm a simple guy, and one of my standby's is the Honey Seared Chicken. If you aren't starving, you can get a good sized chicken and rice dish by ordering the Kids portion and it's only $3.45. It's a total steal and they never ask if I have a kid in the car or anything. Abusive? Maybe. Effective? Totally.",

    "text": "So Pei Wei is one of those places I frequent but not on a consistent basis. Today my son was starving after fasting for a doctor appointment. We roll in about 11:15 on a Wednesday. Immediately was greeted by a friendly gentleman, one star for him. We order, two spring rolls, one regular orange chicken with fried rice, one Mongolian beef with the upgraded cauliflower rice, 2 medium drinks. $31 plus change was our total..wholly wow!  We find a seat, 2 other tables occupied. Spring rolls come out almost as soon as we sat down. I did not try but my son said they were ok.  Five minutes later our entrees arrive. They did look picture perfect but after about 15 seconds I was hit by an off putting smell. One bite of that Mongolian told me why! This dish was scorched. Black egg flecks and cauliflower rice throughout. So I think, I'll just eat the beef, it looked so pretty caramelized. Again one bite was all it took. If it wouldn't have been for that acrid burnt bitter taste the beef would have been divulge of any flavor. Orange chicken was just ok. Some pieces hard and dry, others good. Fried rice was very good and the shining star along with the Coke Freestyle drink machine. One star for the rice.  I should have sent that beef back, I shouldn't have paid the extra $2.50 for cauliflower rice. I SHOULD have driven the extra 10 minutes to our normal, go to Chinese restaurant. Lunch for both with soup would have been half as much and consistently good.  It pains me to say we probably won't be returning to Pei Wei, there is way to much competition in quick service to pay for substandard, overpriced food that my dog wouldn't have eaten.",

I wrote them off for a bit when they axed Blazing Noodles from the menu, but I have a new found appreciation now that I checked out their new menu.  This was my first time at this location and I also hadn't been to one in awhile, so here's a review for ya. We go way back (and Pei Wei just rekindled our former relationship with this visit, so YEAH BABY).  I noticed a number of things about this new menu (for all I know, this menu could be a day old or months...):  - The gluten free and veggie-friendly options are labeled well. Previous veggie-friendly options were always so tricky to work through, and I never trusted them telling me they \"could\" make it veggie-friendly. - It's become more of a \"build-your-own\" style menu with protein to choose, grain/noodle, veggie(s), etc. I always feel so awkward making requests off the typical menu items, so I appreciate this option. - They have daily lunch meal deals! It was a Tuesday and there was an option for a teriyaki rice and veggie bowl with your choice of protein (or just veggies, which I chose). It was only $7 and the regular size. Each day has a different option. - They offer small (cheaper, around $6) and regular sizes (around $9) - Sriracha if you ask for it-- theirs is pretty garlicky, so easy tiger! - Free grab-your-own fortune cookies for the road.  I really loved my teriyaki veggie rice bowl for $7! It was good, HUGE, and affordable. For someone who can TAKE DOWN a Chipotle burrito, it's saying something that I was STRUGGLIN' hard on finishing this regular-sized bowl.   I am back in love, Pei Wei. ::emoji heart eyes::",

    "text": "I used to love Pei Wei; have been going to these restaurants 10+ years. After yesterday I am not sure I will return ever again.  Went in around 8:40 pm, Friday; the kitchen staff had already started cleaning, never a good sign. We each ordered a bowl and some spring rolls.  We received a bunch of the most unappetizing food served ever;I got about 2 lbs of brown rice with a teenie amount of veggies sprinkled about; my poor little one got the driest bowl of noodles with a sampling of chicken (apparently it was their rendering of General Tso's) and the spring rolls were cold and dripping with oil.  Oh, and we did the mistake of visiting their restroom... it was worse than a bar at 2 am.  Pei Wei management: if you are reading this... this location is in serious trouble.",

Ordered for pickup the pei wei spicy with chicken and added broccoli as well as Dan Dan noodles. Not sure if something changed but the chicken in the oei wei spicy was so dry and hard and there was literally no sauce. So bummed out! Order from here a couple times a month and also stop here with coworkers for lunch occasionally and its never been so gross! I can see why the stars are so low on Yelp. Dan Dan noodles were ok but once again those are usually good and have lots of sauce but it's pretty dry. Hard to get a picture to show what I mean but it hurt my teeth to chew the breaded chicken. C'mon pei wei!!! You're one of my go to places to grab food when I don't feel like cooking! So disappointed!",

He gave me a good suggestion and didn't push me to get take out or told me that it's close to the closing time.  He was probably one of the nicest cashier I've ever met.  I'm surprised to read the other reviews, but I was thankful for John and the experience I had. I had Kung Pao Shrimp. Pei Wei is known for their food to be very saucy and sweet, so considering that, it wasn't too bad.  Thanks John for your kind service, you rock!",

Management must already be aware of his demeanor and LACK of customer service. He sounds WORSE than the \"dry-eye guy.\" Sounding extremely dull, the worst personnel to have interacting with customers. Advice for management, remove this young man from the register.   We've spent $60 for our meal and with this purchase was EXTRA chicken. Did not even receive a NORMAL portion of chicken.   The previous time we've dined, the soda machine was not stocked with syrup - limiting our drink options. Same story with this visit, OUT OF SYRUP.   Expected to have an appropriate cashier, perverted cashier. Paid for extra chicken, less chicken. Paid for a beverage, no syrup. The general manager sounds like a cheap GM who seeks to save costs on hiring excellent customer service professionals and save on food/syrup.   This is the second (and last time) dining at Pei Wei. ALL should be encouraged to dine with Panda Express for regular portions, without asking to pay for more.",

I love the menu and how quick the fresh food is prepared. this location is super close to both my work and my home so I go there quite frequently, and I must say, i'm disappointed more than half of the time.  1. the employees that take orders (based on the 15+ times i've been there) never smile and typically lack any hospitable qualities, which i'm assuming is a reflection of poor management at the location.  2. the sushi at this location is typically dry and old... I know if I want sushi, pei wei isn't the ideal place to go, but sometimes i'm craving it and il get some on the side... learned that lesson.  3. the tables are always sticky!!! 4. their dang soda machine is literally ALWAYS out of majority of drinks no matter what time of day or when! i've purchased a drink a few times and had literally no options but vitamin water to choose from!  regardless of this review, i'll continue going there.. i'm just hoping that this review, which sounds a lot like others, might help make a difference in management in making some improvements.",

Now he's 3rd in line.   5 more minutes pass, during which time 2 parties behind walk out due to the long wait.   Reaches counter.   Scowling hostess: \"What would you like?\"  My son:  \"Can I please have the Thai Dynamite Chicken with white rice\"  \"Sure. And for you?\"  Me: \"Um, I'd like the $5 General Tso's special, please.\"  \"We're not doing that special anymore.  That ended.\"  Me, nodding towards the massive screen advertising the special, as well as the printed sign posted on a flier on the wall over her shoulder: \"You mean the advertised special over there and there?\"  (snaps eyes to the screen) \"Yeah, it rings up as $8.99 now when I put it in. It's over.\"  Silence  Me: \"Ok, I guess I'll have the $5 Mongolian Monday bowl with white rice.  You're still doing that?\"  \"Yes\"  Sits at table with son.   Food finally arrives.   Son's meal is served with fried rice, not white, so the (very nice) server brings out an extra bowl of white rice.   The chicken in my bowl is lukewarm and tastes like it has been reheated, not freshly cooked.  You know that flavor you get if you try to pan fry left over Chinese food from the night before?  That flavor.   Visited the bathroom when it was time to leave and it was seriously the nastiest bathroom I've visited this side of the Gila Bend Texaco.  Urine everywhere. Soap and water all over the sink counters.  Trash on floor.  It was truly impressive.  I left here wondering, \"Is this Pei Wei Diner franchised?\"  I've eaten at Pei Weis all over the Valley for the last 18 years or so, including frequently at the one by my house on Bell, and have never had an experience as negative as this one from start to finish.    The only bright spot was the table waiter, a young man whose name I didn't catch. He corrected the incorrect rice order proactively and cheerfully.    We used to eat at this Pei Wei frequently after church years ago, then stopped when it was converted to a diner and the menu changed.  This was my first return trip in years and very vividly reminded me why we quit it in the first place.   Pei Wei GM: Trust me when I say this, you have issues at this store.",

Apparently they didn't have the soup. The waitress did not tell me this. The cashier did not tell me this. It took my sister-in-law to get up and go ask. And then when the waitress did come over and tell me it was only because my sister-in-law made her.     There were no apologies made. Horrible service. All the way around. And yes I filled out the survey and was quite honest. One of the questions of the survey was, \"would you like someone to call you about this? \". I indicated \"yes I would\".

I had the liberty of trying the orange chicken with noodles and I gotta say that i was only able to get half way through it.  I bet you that the corporate recipe has been altered just a bit and if it hasn't the blame goes all the way to the top.   In regards to the service don't expect much.  The minute they are done taking your order you are pretty much forgotten.    Sorry but I am just not a big fan, this place is definitely not for me.  I just saying that if you want a good bowl of noodles with chicken this is not the healthiest option, this play is only a one way highway to diabetes.    Pei Wei is just another form of fast food and that is just what it is and we all know fast food is not healthy for you.",

I still really like Pei Wei food, at least the food they used to serve, but I'm not sure what is going on lately. First of all they've changed the menu and not in a positive way. They've now added sushi and just like nearly every other fast-casual restaurant in town they've gone to this thing were you order a bowl of rice or some other base and then add your protein. I suppose that's great if you're going to Kyoto Bowl or something, but Pei Wei had its own niche and now it seems to have abandoned that.  Secondly, they no longer serve pot stickers. Really? Was it too much trouble to make pot stickers and serve them? They'd already changed the style and made them less tasty, but dropping them altogether is ridiculous!  Also, the food doesn't taste as good. My go-to is either the Kung Pao Chicken or the Mongolian Beef and the last few times I've had they just taste rubbery as if they have not been fully cooked. In fact, I was afraid I was going to get food poisoning they were so undercooked.  Finally, they were out of fortune cookies the last time I visited. How does a Chinese, sorry Asian-fusion, restaurant run out of fortune cookies????  I get that they are no longer owned by P.F. Chang's, but it just seems like the new ownership is taking this chain downhill fast. I used to crave Pei Wei but now it's just meh and not worth going out of my way to get.  Don't waste your time.",

    "text": "It's hard to believe there aren't already numerous reviews of Pei Wei Asian Diner at this point in time. Perhaps as busy as the parking lot always is, it was a bit daunting for potential reviewers who were intimidated and kept on driving. Maybe those lucky few who secured a sacred parking spot stepped inside and were overwhelmed by the number of patrons stacked inside?  Don't get me wrong. I never have been unhappy in my many, many... many excursions to Pei Wei. If you like PF Chang's, you'll like this more informal diner version. I always tend to order the same dish (Pad Thai with Pork... it brings me a feeling of peace and comfort) and it's consistently delicious. In fact, it's quite craveable. On top of that,  the service has always been fast and hospitable. Usually when waiting on a take-out order it's not uncommon for someone behind the counter to offer me a complimentary beverage while I wait. If nothing else, watching 5 foot flames shoot from the woks in the kitchen is an enjoyable way to pass the time... if you're a pyromaniac.  If you go during peak times, you may be in for a bit of a wait for a table. It's not uncommon to wait 10 minutes or longer around lunchtime (Noon) or Dinner (6pm). If you are dining alone (I won't judge you), you can always phone ahead, zip in through the door marked \"Take Out\" and be on your way home from the gym to enjoy your deep fried morsels in no time flat. You may want to bring someone to ride wingman. Then they can run in to get it for you while you circle the terminally full parking lot. Otherwise you may end up walking from another ZIP Code or wishing they provided a shuttle service.  Great food and service on a consistent basis. Fast service... if you call and order ahead of time. If they can do something to alleviate the crowds, wait times and parking situation or better yet, offer a delivery option, I might be tempted to add another star. But that's just part of dining in the city and it won't deter me from many more trips there.",

    "text": "Not being a big fan of Chinese food myself, I decided to humor my partner in crime and try something of her choosing this Friday evening. After hearing my parents and food snob brother rant about the one in Avondale, I figured being a chain, it couldn't be much worse (or better) at this location.  Since I was hungry (having not eaten all day due to my sensitive piercing [see my review for HTC]) we ordered 2 apps (edamame and the chicken lettuce wraps), for our entrees she had the Kung Pao chicken while I had the Thai coconut curry shrimp.  The edamame came out pretty quickly, but were kinda \"over-reheated\" although fairly tasty. The lettuce wraps were OK. While the lettuce was great and very crisp and fresh, the chicken mixture was a little overdone and underseasoned. I've had better lettuce wraps at BJ's, to be totally honest.  Out came the entrees and again, nothing special, but not bad. The chicken in her entree was, again, a little overcooked but not enough to make it inedible...I personally thought they were a little stingy with the peanuts, but the flavor was OK. Enough heat to make the dish enjoyable but not hot enough that you would start sweating profusely.  My coconut curry shrimp smelled delicious and tasted the same. They definitely aren't stingy with the protein in either entree we tried. My only gripe with my entree was that it came out a little on the cool side, and without seeing any visible peppers, the seasoning throughout was a little inconsistent...a few bites would have no heat at all, then I'd fish out a shrimp and chomp away and I'd be in tears due to the spice.  So, I wouldn't say it was good enough to change my opinion of Chinese food, but it was definitely a nice change of pace and I would go back again. 4 stars down to 3 as the cashier/order taker was a little snotty and impatient for my taste.",

I like that they'll sub or add things for you.  I always add broccoli to any dish that doesn't have it or extra to a dish that does.  I'm a sucker for broccoli.  It's nice not to be charged too.  And the brown rice alternative is a good option.  The serving sizes are large and generally too much for one person.  We'll do take out from here ocassionally.  For 4 people, we'll order 3 entrees and one order of lettuce wraps and that's perfect...no left overs and no waste.    My faves are the Spicey Korean with chicken and the Ginger Broccoli with Shrimp.  It's not cheap, but the ingredients are quality.  Not traditional Asian food, it's more fusion.  It is what it is and I like it.",

I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice-- my very favorite and it didn't taste very good.  It was okay- but just not as good as usual.  The 2 star is for my dish and the zero stars are for my fiance's soppy noodle mess called Chicken lo mein--- ewwwwwwwwww!  I think Ramen noodles tasted better and cost only 11 cents.  They were so mooshy that they barely could stay on the fork-- really gross.  They were tasteless.  We threw it out.    Pei Wei-- I miss the good times.",

    "text": "Moved to the area, hadn't had Pei Wei in a while so I decided to try this location. Not at all how I used to remember Pei Wei food. Maybe it's just this location, but the food has been terrible. I've always loved the lettuce wraps, but the last two times I've ordered it, the lettuce I've been given has been the very inside of a head of lettuce-that nobody eats. You know, the small, yellow, wrinkly parts. It was impossible to make a wrap out of it, so I had to throw it in a bowl and make a salad. Which defeats the whole purpose of a lettuce wrap? My last order was Pad Thai, and the broccoli was limp and the florettes were yellow. Like the broccoli was old and should've just been thrown out. I've only had take out, so I can't comment too much on the service. One time when picking up my takeout, I watched a young gentleman with longer hair checking people out. I noticed he kept running his hands through his hair constantly. Which my first thought was, unsanitary! You work in a restaurant. But then figured it was okay since he was only handling money. But then I saw him go over and finish food orders, like add sesame seeds and whatever special little things they do at that counter. Grossed me out.",

Tried the Honey Seared Chicken and it was the most dry dish I've ever had. It also had no flavor, which is one thing that kept me going back to the old Pei Wei. We also tried a salad, but it basically only tasted like the little tangerines pieces in it. I guess I should've known this was a bad place when they completely eliminated the kids menu. Oh, and putting everything in to-go dishes just seems so wasteful! I won't return here ever again.",

We finally went last night after the new \"Market\"  opened.  I like the idea of the smaller portions. I can even deal with the new limited menu... But what used to be fresh food, wok-seared and served extremely hot is now pre-made and warmed up then plopped into a plastic dish.  Then you get to find your own plastic utensil to eat with.  The people that used to work there that we saw on a regular basis are now different employees, and with no customer service (bordering on rude).  The new seating is uncomfortable, and the ambiance is non existent.  We will never go back.  For 30 cents more, and a drive over to 44th & Thomas, we can get twice as much food, that is served well (and HOT)  by people who act like they care if we are happy eating there.    I understand this is a pilot restaurant to compete with the fast food joints.  If I want that, I will go to Panda Express.  Pei Wei, you are making a HUGE mistake.  Bad move!",

    "text": "\"What were they thinking?\" is exactly what I thought. A friend and I visited this location today thinking we were going to PeiWei. Apparently, it is now a PeiWei Market. I knew something was up right away when we walked in. Not only was the decor totally different (looked like the food court at the mall), but there was nobody in there. Used to be difficult to even find a parking space. Not any more. I order my food and she asks me what size I want. I should have left then. Instead, I played along and ordered my food. $12.35 later, my number was yelled by the zit faced teenagers that work at this place, and I picked up my food. Looked like a damn lean cuisine, only not as good. It was served in the same plastic container and was about the same size. Everything is now served on to-go plastic, whether you are eating it there or not. Plastic tray, plastic dish, plastic fork, plastic cups.   The most amusing part was to watch people walk in and order. When they received their food, they had this bewildered look on there face, like what the hell is this? Where am I? Everyone around us was not happy. Rather than convert an existing store, they should have just built a new one. Anyone who ate at PeiWei before, will surely not like the new changes. This concept will fail.   Anyone who is considering PeiWei Market, save your money. Stay home and fix yourself a lean cuisine. Your wallet and palette will thank you.",

    "text": "Definitely falls into the \"what where they thinking?\" category. Our  neighborhood Pei Wei - a block from our offices and a weekly favorite for 5 years, has changed to Pei Wei Asian Market - a sort of cheap food court concept, without the mall. Obviously this is a more inexpensive operation to run. Portions are a lot smaller, and about a dollar or two cheaper. Not all bad, but many favorites seem to be gone.   Plastic has replaced the restaurant-ware, and not cool custom plastic, but basic restaurant supply take-away stock. No green PR there. The warm, PF-asian decor has been replaced by a basic black and industrial box with so much parking lot glare during lunch that it's hard to select your plastic utensils from the self-serve area. The restaurant is now noisy and the seemingly uncomfortable staff calling out order numbers adds to the din.   Now in all fairness, we've tried the restaurant a few times since the reopen. The food was fine every time and the flavors good. Not where I'd go if I was hungry, but the value seemed good. Truly, if this was in the mall, it would likely do fine. Unfortunately it's not. Alas we mourn the loss of our local Pei Wei.",

The restaurant is smaller than the average Pei Wei, and seems to be more of a fast food atmosphere.  This location is missing the quality of the other Pei Wei restaurants.  They only offer the basic items from Pei Wei and none of the newer promotional item like the Diner Selects I was looking for.  It is missing some of the fancy touches that makes Pei Wei more desirable than Panda Express.  Food was good, but not quite what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a high quality Pei Wei, try an Asian Diner, not the Asain Market version.  Not bad to eat at, but not interesting enough to recommend.",

Portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu.   The good news - the decor and the layout are quite nice.   The bad news - I just really don't get it. It is like Pei Wei with a few odd items and higher prices. The portions and prices have been reduced, but seems to be more expensive. Also, they have removed the kids menu.",

    "text": "They ruined Pei Wei! They actually redecorated to make the place look low rent. Somewhere there's someone in upper management who needs to be fired. Redecorate to downgrade the atmosphere -- seriously? Employees now wear t-shirts and jeans instead of the nice uniforms they wore before. A bunch of teenagers work there instead of the staff that used to know what they were doing.  Worst of all, the new menu sucks. Nothing here that you can't get for half the price at any Chinese take out place in the valley. No more Dan Dan Noodles. No more Lo Mein. No more vanilla chai tea. Now there are just a few rice bowls and no noodle dishes. The music is so loud that you can't even hear them call out your order number as though you were at Taco Bell or McDonald's. Because eating a meal without having to listen to the teenagers at the counter shout out numbers is too upscale. So is actual silverware. Everything that made Pei Wei funky is gone. I guess it is still asian fusion -- it's just a fusion with fast food quality. All that's missing is a drive through.  They do still have tofu, which I appreciate. However, I had Mongolian tofu and the sauce tasted like it was straight out of a jar. The food was barely warm. The mushrooms were raw. My dining partner's portions were laughable. Maybe a half cup of rice and less than a half cup of mongolian beef.   Yes, I know Pei Wei is a chain restaurant but I used to really enjoy the food. I'm so disappointed. I won't be back.",

We'll, all that changed was that they brought back plates vs plastic take out.  I ordered a Chinese chicken salad and when I got it was served with the dressing on the side. I ask the young boy to have the chef \"toss\" my salad. He looked at my like I was crazy. When the salad returned it was exactly the same as when it left -- dry and untossed.   I had to walk up to the cooks area to ask them to \"Toss my salad in the dressing\"....  Anyway, the whole environment  of this location is off - the flow of the restaurant is weird and I WONT BE BACK ever again.   TOSSING a salad doesn't mean to puke your guts out - It means to toss the salad with the dressing.    Do I really have to explain this?   I guess so...Just a weird experience and weird place.",

    "text": "Had lunch at the Glendale location today. It had been quite a long time since I'd eaten at Pei Wei. It's not the same quality as it was when it opened. In the beginning...the food was barely second to that served at a PF Changs. It was quite good, easy to access and everything that accompanied the food was higher quality (drinks, napkins, fortune cookies, staff/bussers).  I ordered a small chicken orange peel with brown rice ($6.49) and my BF ordered the large shrimp kung pao ($9.99) and we also ordered 2 side spring rolls $3.79. I believe the smaller portion option is new to Pei Wei as I'm sure they're trying to capture a larger market w/less expensive prices or portions. For lunch, the small is just fine for most, especially if you get an extra little side with it.   BUT...HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SMALL AND ORIGINAL PORTION SIZE..YOU PAY MORE FOR ADD'L RICE WHEN YOU ORDER THE ORIGINAL, NOT ADD'L MEAT.  Plate next to plate my BF had the same amount of meat (shrimp) in comparison to my (chicken)...his plate was larger and it had more than twice the amount of rice on my plate. So comparing apples to apples you pay $2 to $2.20 more for MORE rice, not necessarily more meat when you order an original vs a small depending on what kind of meat you order.   So...Just wanted to give you the heads up when you consider ordering small or original.",

Brown rice was well cooked.  Snickerdoodle cookie was tasty.  Water cup was tiny, and their water irks me in that you have to load the cup with ice as the water comes out warm.  The cashier didn't know what was in menu items and directed me to the takeout menu that listed ingredients.  Sadly, they keep removing things from the menu, including my mom's favorite Korean beef lettuce wraps.  She said the current chicken ones are too bland.",

So if you want the exact same thing you ordered last time (including customizations), BAM!, it's done and ready for pick up in 10-15 minutes. This works great for my family. Pretty consistent on quality and portion size and customer service is always fantastic.  They offer smaller sizes in addition to the original size portions. Vegetarian (which also happens to be vegan here) sauce options are clearly labeled on the menu. Our favorites are teriyaki and honey seared.   There is a ton of sugar, fat, and salt in the sauces, but you can make your dish a little healthier by ordering your protein (tofu in our case) stock velvet, which is steamed instead of fried. We also get extra veggies and brown rice instead of white for a little more fiber. Pretty sure eating with chop sticks makes it healthier too.  Wish they'd bring back the veggie lettuce wraps.",

I've only visited this location four times and half of my visits have been less than ideal. What appalls me the most is that no manager or person of authority came out to say a simple apology. I get that lunch is busy, however, it does not pardon management from apologizing to their guest for waiting longer than normal for their food.

I know long ticket times is not the norm, but if the lack of accepting responsibility and not apologizing to your guest is, it might be a while until I return to this location, let alone recommend it to friends and colleagues.",
