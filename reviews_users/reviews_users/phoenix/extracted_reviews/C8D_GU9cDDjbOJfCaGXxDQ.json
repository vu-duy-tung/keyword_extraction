The bar was a little too crowded to wait there, so we went a couple of doors down to pass our time.  On to dinner...we had a great server.  He was super friendly, nice and was vocal with his opinions.  I would love to tell you that all of his reccs were spot on...but they weren't.  We started with the pretzels and the cheese fondue. DELISH.  I went halfsies with my friend and we shared the prime rib sammie and the shrimp caesar salad.  The prime rib sammie was mediocre.  The beef wasn't flavored at all, and when we got the fries, they were cold.  Hot plate, cold food..not a good sign.  We did get fresh fries, I didn't finish my half, and moved on to the salad.  The salad was good, but not great.  All in all, I would go for a drink and some apps, but wouldn't really want to eat dinner here again.  I may have just ordered wrong...but two meh things do it for me.",

    "text": "After a 40 min. wait to get in on a Saturday (standard), we had to wait another 40 minutes to get our food, which wasn't expected or appreciated.  I ordered the Pork Belly Cubano and it was missing the all important pork belly.  After the wait I just ate it and left with a feeling of \"I'll never eat there again\".  The server and another helper had apprehension when the food was delivered.  Sort of \"I hope he doesn't notice it doesn't have Pork Belly!\".  The server even comically asked if it was our first trip to C.D..  Possibly a probing question into weather or not I knew I had just been screwed.  The sandwich was cold and had a Subway quality cold lunch meat.  To add insult to injury I got a plate full of dirty scrap fries.  My wife's Chicken Hash with black truffles was also kind of a joke.  You can get a better hash at the Cheesecake factory without the pretense.  All in all Culinary Dropout lives up to it's name.  We didn't write a review on our first trip to but it was forgettable and this second trip just leaves me feeling ashamed of myself.",

    "text": "I hardly ever give five star reviews. My experience at Culinary Dropout today prompted me to do so. The reason we checked this place out was because I had a 25% coupon from Fox RC for Labor Day. First things first: The employees are extremely good looking. There is lots of tattoos and bare skin. Our bartender was awesome. He answered all our dumb questions with a smile and made some killer drinks. I had the Bacon Infused Bloody Mary and my friend had the Acai Mojito. I will be going back again to have that Bloody Mary. It was SO good. We started out with the homemade chips and onion dip and it was delicious. We pretty much filled up on those before we got our meals. I ordered the Havarti Burger, my roommate got the chef salad, and my other friend got the canneloni. Everything was super good, but it was too much food! My burger melted in my mouth and I kept stealing bites of my friend's salad. So, in a nutshell:  - Great vibe. - Great food. - Great drinks. - Hot employees. - Clever menu titles/ - Great experience!",

Food: we had the pretzel fondue for an appetizer, which was a nice treat because I don't order fondue often. I followed this with a turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun, which was amazing and different (although a tad messy, but it was so great I didn't care). Another thing I Iiked was that they didn't overload the plate with fries, like most places do...the sandwich came with just the right amount...and those were good!  It was fairly busy, but not packed. We received great service from our server, and it looked like they had plenty of staff to tend to the other tables. Oh and one other thing: our server was actually friendly, something that is not commonplace in that part of town. The manager (I'm guessing) actually came by, and checked in with us to make sure we we're enjoying our lunch...and he was friendly as well.  I'll definitely be returning in the future!",

    "text": "Pretty much agree with the other reviews but have to say that the super long wait for a table and ridiculously loud atmosphere (although it is really kinda cool and trendy) is worth it for the turkey pastrami sandwich. Forget everything else on the menu and get this sandwich. Just do it. It's the best sandwich I've ever had and I've had some amazing sandwiches and I'm super picky, too!! The cole slaw is amazing. The turkey is smokey and lean. The pretzel bun is to die for. SO good. We also always get the cheese plate. We're from Wisconsin. We know good cheese. This place has a great cheese plate. I also tried the grilled cheese sliders but seriously, nothing else is as good as the turkey. Sat next to a guy who almost had an orgasm over the monkey bread dessert but I didn't try it (should have!) Overall, it's worth the wait and noise but they really, really need to get on Open Table and start taking reservations. Would help a lot. Also need some waiting areas and to cut back on the volume of the music or add some acoustic elements so you're not deaf when you leave. Wouldn't mind some better cocktails, too. I've had two and neither of them were very good. I'll go for wine next time. Will still go back for the food but hope to see some improvement on the flow of the restaurant, overall. I'll continue to try to go on weeknights and late at night so I can get in without standing outside for an hour.",

The Waterfront is one of my favorite areas of town to walk around, and fueling up beforehand with dinner at Culinary Dropout is always a good idea!  Another thought I always have here is, \"why do we even bother with eating anywhere that's not a Fox RC?\" I've lived here for over 6 years (gasp) and I'm always astounded at the bad customer service that goes on in restaurants and bars here. We've NEVER had a bad moment at a Fox place, and for that, they've earned our loyalty.   Culinary Dropout is always crowded, and always loud. It can make conversation a little hard, but those damn pretzel bites with provolone fondue are worth it. You get like...40382 little pretzel bites, and that's only a slight exaggeration.   Everything we've tried on the menu is delicious. Our most recent trip included the fried chicken/biscuit/mashed potato plate for my husband (honey-drizzle, people) and a delicious sweet corn ravioli made with smoked shallots for me. Those smoked shallots. I now dream of them. Drinks are always good as well, and by \"drinks\" I mean they pour bubbly and keep it coming for me. Sold!  Short and sweet: Always a solid choice!",

From the miss matched but perfectly flowing furniture, to the live music, and very laid back atmosphere, it is definitely trendy hipster. I love the food.   Appetizer: Pretzels and Fondue for appetizer are definitely delicious.   Main Course: I've had the FRIED CHICKEN plate. The food was great, and as the menu says it does take time to make. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was bone in - and I am not a fan of that. I had the MEATLOAF the other day and it was VERY good. All of their food is on point. I don't feel like you could go wrong with any of their dishes! Preservation is always on point too.   What to Drink: Last but not least what to drink! THE DEVIANT BEHAVIOR is my favorite. For $10 you get a cocktail and a beer to mix to your liking. I think it is so delicious and the price point is awesome! It is a must try!",

The menu is lacking, there's barely any choices so for families with picky eaters and little kids or anyone who likes just regular food this isn't the place for you. All of us got a burger since it was the only thing on the menu that looked somewhat good and I will say that it was tasty and juicy but that was the only good part about our experience. The place was so crowded we had to wait 1 hour to be seated and when we were seated we were smushed into this table with tons of other tables basically on top of us that's how many people they tried to cram in. There was some band playing really really bad music and it was so loud that we literally couldn't even have a conversation with each other. We couldn't even hear our waitress!! And the staff is not very friendly. I'm not sure if it's because we were in Scottsdale or if they just have bad customer services skills but we got no friendly vibes off of them and at times our waitress would disappear for up to 30 minutes on end just talking with her co-workers. I will never be going back.",

The first time we went in we opted to just sit at the bar & have drinks & dessert. No one was attentive; we had to flag down the bartender to take our order & get our check. Additionally, I got a lot of attitude when I told them that I didn't really like the dessert. Overall, it was just a blah experience, especially considering how much we paid for our order.  The second time we went, the service was a little better than the first time. We sat down for dinner & ordered the mac burger & the fried chicken. The coleslaw which came with the fried chicken wasn't very good; if ordered again, I'd get just the chicken with mashed potatoes & gravy. The mac burger was large & my date seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, however, I find that there's nothing great about the meal or the experience when dining at this restaurant. I understand there might be other meals that are worth the money but as I've experienced it, I can't justify going back & getting $16 fried chicken & mashed potatoes.",

We started with drinks and then she suggested appetizers -chips with their onion dip.  AWESOME!  They were delicious.  We decide to split the chicken salad and she warned us it had mayo ....classic chicken salad.  Glad she mentioned that.  We also ordered the soup of the day which was \"yesterdays\" soup and it was excellent.    The staff was awesome and the food was great.

Our service was excellent (shout out to our server) and the food was just as good. The only down side was that we really didn't want to stick around for 10 & 11$ drinks all afternoon. Which were good but not worth it.",

It wasn't pretentious , a little against the grain (another plus for me) & food was top notch.  We had the prosciutto deviled eggs and humboldt fog cheese  for appetizers. Both were delicious. I washed it down with a Kilt Lifter. For dinner I chose the Korean style ribeye cap while my friends ordered the meatloaf and ribs.  The ribeye was perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals and commented  several times about the quality of the food, atmosphere and  friendliness of the staff.  I highly recommend it and will go back next time I'm in town.",

Re: Good looking staff:  We had a handsome waiter, the other young ladies are just average looking.  The chairs had worn out cushions and i sank in them.   The food was good but a few discrepancies on the menu:  The Butternut squash Cannelloni  is actually Ravioli! Do you reviewers not know the difference? And there was supposed to be corn, white asparagus and sugar snap or snow peas with included but were missing--they would have added to the overall taste, value and nutrition of the menu.   Appetizers: ordered the mussels and got a great portion with a wonderful broth and superb toasty bread for dipping. A few of the mussels had an off taste though.   Also a port cheese from France which I thought would have a port wine swirl through it but it was very tasty. Served with a berry jam, I would have preferred a crushed olive dipper. (for $4 I can't complain.) Desert: carmel corn custard something or other, more than for one person. It was more sweet than an expected sweet and salty.   Shared the entire meal and it came to 51.and change. Good deal for 2 ladies who are watching their calorie intake and want something different.   Will be back for appetizers and happy hour.  Of note: Again, I am a seasoned fish and chipper-- please serve malt vinegar at the table when serving. The coleslaw looked very healthy, not  mushy.",

But the amount of food we got and the quality of the food was fantastic.   Pretzel and Fondue was a okay. But the amount of pretzel rolls we got was totally worth the buck. Chips with onion dips was the best chips I have ever had. It was crispy, fresh, and non-greasy. It was refreshing to see how little oil was absorbed to the wax paper. Onion dip was not amazing but goes well with the chips. Grill cheese sliders was decent. But not amazing compare to the pretzel and the chips. The biggest disappointment would be the Korean Chicken and Shrimp. Portion was small, flavor was nothing Korean, and the presentation was just not appealing.   Over all we had a great time and will likely to return to try other regular menu items.",

I always get the pretzel and provolone appetizer and the grilled cheese. Both to die for. They also have a lot of unusual drinks that are quite tasty!   I do, however, have to say that it is not worth hitting up for happy hour. There are only a few items to choose from and most of the drinks are still full price. I went with a friend recently and we, of course, ordered the pretzel and provolone appetizer. When we got our bill, we noticed that we were charged full price for the appetizer when it was supposed to be half price. When we asked our waitress, she said \"OH...I did not realize that you guys were here for happy hour. You see, the happy hour version of the appetizer is half the SIZE which is why it is half the price. You guys got the full size so it is full price.\" Does this seem weird to anyone else? When you order an appetizer at 3pm on Friday afternoon isn't it implied that you are wanting happy hour? And is it really even a \"deal\" if you are getting 1/2 the quantity anyway? Weird.",

And where a regular burger has a piece or two of bacon, this was stacked! Very flavorful. My only complaint is I got my water refilled once the whole time I was there... I had to steal my hubby's water. Otherwise would have had 5 stars! I'll definitely come back sometime.",

Once again, I had the pretzel fondue which consists of this yummy hot cheese in a little pot, accompanied by these absolutely to-die-for \"pretzels\" . These pretzels are NOT the box variety, but little baby loaves of pretzel bread, which I have now started day-dreaming about... In addition, I had the turkey pastrami sandwich (also on a pretzel bun) and it was perfectly wonderful.  My husband had the ribeye, which was sliced and had a delish blue cheesey sauce on the bottom. He loved it (I snagged a bite, it was mightly good!).  This is was weekend night, and the place was packed with beautiful young people all decked out (well,except for us, that is). The music was a little bit loud (like bar loud) for me, but the food will be calling me back...not to mention that fabulous pretzel bread...",

    "text": "Stopped in for a drink and a pre-dinner snack on a Wednesday evening. The place was very trendy and full of beautiful hipsters. I sat at the bar and was served promptly. They had a really interesting cocktail menu as well as a great beer and wine by the glass selection. I ended up getting the Velvet Death which had Death's Door Gin, Velvet Falernum, Lemon, Cointreau and Absinthe. A fantastic cocktail.  I wanted something substantial for a snack but not a real full meal. They had a good selection of cheeses and charcuterie but I was a bit disappointed by their appetizer selection. Seemed to lack substance and favored fried bar items. While it is a gastropub and it looked far more like a traditional restaurant so I was expecting more.   The sandwiches and entrees looked very promising and I ended up getting a Chicken Hash which was roasted potatoes and sauteed chicken with onions that is covered in a light brown gravy. This is topped with two fried eggs and a bit of shaved truffle. The dish looked amazing and I loved the ingredients. Unfortunately, it lacked flavor. I didn't taste the truffles at all, despite ingesting obvious chunks of them. As a truffle fan this was particularly disappointing. The gravy was also very bland. I wish there would have been a bit more chicken in the chicken hash as well. Very skimpy portions. That being said, the eggs and potatoes were cooked perfectly and were really delicious and saved the dish.  While I only got a small taste of things at Culinary Dropout, it showed real promise. I'd definitely go back and give it another shot. My one concern is that which I had for many \"trendy\" places in Scottsdale in that it is a bit too trendy, clubby and clique-y. Since it was relatively early on a mid-week night and I sat at the bar I was able to get service but I got the feeling that might not be the case all the time.  All in all, the bit of food I had was good (with promise) and the drink was wonderful.",

Since we'd never been there, he suggested some meats and cheeses and the pretzels with provolone fondue. He explained the cheeses we weren't familiar with and recommended his favorites and which ones were crowd pleasers etc... he wasn't pushy or irritated when we decided not to have more food and just go for dessert. He was definitely what you'd want in a server and they should be glad they have him on staff. Actually, the other servers that ran our food were all very friendly as well. It seems like a well oiled machine. The only kind of weird thing was the staff didn't seem to have a defined uniform so it was kind of hard to tell who worked there but it wasn't a problem. I mean, who hasn't worn a red shirt to Target and had someone ask you where garbage bags are? If I had a complaint, it would be that the meats (we had salumi and procuitto) and cheese ( hard cheddar and soft with a truffle oil) were a bit pricey to not come with bread or crackers. It was extra and had a balsamic drizzle on it which overpowered the flavors of the cheese. The pickled peppers were forgettable but the deviled eggs were good as well as the Bourbon black bottom pie with caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream.",

He ordered the ribs, which are now in my top fave dishes - definitely recommend! For dessert we shared the bourbon black bottom pie (that might not be the exact name) and it was DE-LICIOUS. I would come here again just for this dessert. Drink wise, we ordered the room service - didn't disappoint if you like bubbles, and pistols at dawn - a bourbon twist to a Moscow Mule that will put some hair on your chest.  My only real complaint was that the live music is LOUD. You can't hear each other speak and carry on any conversation that lasts longer than the breaks between songs. I couldn't even hear my waitress. Not the best place for a date night, but if you're a group of friends who want to listen to some live music and not talk to each other, this might be a nice spot.",

The pretzels (actually a huge plate of large, soft, pillowy pretzel bites) and the cheese sauce were quite good, though under seasoned (as was EVERYTHING; apparently salt is a four-letter word in this kitchen). The meatloaf was also quite good, the mashed potatoes and coleslaw were better than average, the green beans...well, they were just plain ol' green beans.   The bad: the fried chicken was tasteless (again, no salt) and waaayyy overcooked; burnt, dry and virtually inedible. I'm guessing this may not be unusual as the bartender said nothing as she threw the chicken in the trash.",

All portions were filling, just right. Love the decor and the staff was attentive. Pricing was appropriate for the complete experience. Great location to stop in for lunch, first date, celebrating with friends, or informal business meeting. Will come again.",

During a recent trip we made two visits and loved both.  The first visit was for dinner on the patio... highly recommend getting their early as it does fill up quick!  Our waiter gave excellent advise in recommending the Korean Rib Eye Cap entree... I should have taken a picture but instead took a bite and couldn't stop eating!  Our second trip was at lunch and we sat at the bar.  For this trip I tried the Fried Chicken, which does require about a 20 minute wait but it is worth it!  I am tempted to compare the meal to KFC, but far far elevated.  The entree comes with three pieces of chicken (fried perfectly), mashed potatoes with gravy, and home made slaw.   Overall everything we ate was great!  I personally would have liked the mashed potatoes to be slightly creamier but my Fiancee thought they were perfect so that is likely a personal preference.  For both visits we tried the Room Service and Old Fashioned cocktails, both of which were well balanced and delicious.  If you normally enjoy a French 75 then you will love the Room Service!",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout features deliciously creative dishes, in a relaxing but tasteful environment. Price points are higher as it is Scottsdale, but not outrageous enough to make you gasp.  I stumbled across Culinary Dropout while exploring Fashion Square, and what a pleasant surprise it was.  To drink, I went with the Soiled Dove. A mix of blackberry, and Paloma, it was very refreshing and super easy to drink.  For food, I started with the Perogies. Served in an order of 3 for $10, at first glance, I was a bit disappointed due to the cost for the portion size. As soon as I took my first bite however, this opinion quickly changed. The perogies were incredible, and some of the best I've ever had. The mustard creme fraiche they were served on top of only further helped add to the dish, and really made it stand out.  For my entree, I had the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich. While I love the Turkey Pastrami itself, and the pretzel roll it was served on was quite delectable, I didn't particularly care for the slaw on top, as at times, it sort of took over the dish, making it hard to taste the rest. It was served with a side of handcuffs fries, but not a personal fan of the fry style, I only picked at them, rather than eating them all.   Service was fantastic throughout the entire meal, from the very friendly hostess who greeted when I came in, to my server, Kelsey, who was always around whenever I needed anything.  I will definitely be returning to Culinary Dropout again in the future, and look forward to returning on a night they have live music!",

    "text": "The mood, lighting, and atmosphere all around was very appealing (which is what attracted us there in the first place). The menu selections all sounded wonderful until our food actually arrived. It was very mediocre. I would have considered going back, except for the fact that the service was even worse than the food.   I ordered a bottle of wine for my boyfriend and I to split. It didn't come to the table until after all of our food arrived. I'm assuming it's because our waitress was under 21 and unable to serve it herself, but she never even brought us waters in the meantime. The waitress that did serve the wine brought it directly to my boyfriend and asked if he'd like to try it without even acknowledging my presence, even though I'm the one who ordered the bottle in the first place. Which is even more annoying considering that our waitress was standing next to her witnessing this. He awkwardly handed her my glass to gesture that, and she said to him, \"Oh, would you like her to try it instead?\", as though I needed my boyfriend's permission to try the wine I ordered. It was an uncomfortable and awkward situation.   We ordered a couple of appetizers with our meals. I ordered the BBQ Pork Belly nachos appetizer as my meal and told the waitress this so she knew to bring it out later with my boyfriend's burger instead of with the other appetizer. Go figure, the nachos were one of the first things to arrive. Our waitress even made a comment about them coming out sooner than I was hoping when she saw them on the table, yet did nothing about it. They weren't bad, but definitely nothing special considering that they were just made with processed cheese and fancy toppings (I honestly didn't expect anything more, so this didn't necessarily disappoint me). However, we were sitting outside in 55 degree weather, so the nachos got cold pretty fast, which made them even more disappointing. The rest of the food was good, but not great.   Needless to say, we will not be going back, even if we were to have better service. The food itself wasn't worth it. If this is what Culinary School dropout food is like then my advice to the future chefs out there...DON'T DROP OUT!!",

My husband got the fish and chips. The fish had a very different seasoning on it which was very unexpected but amazing! Very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.

However, the actual dishes we ordered were extremely salty. I got the veggie/squash or something cannoli, and my BF got the salmon. Both dishes were cooked okay but just really salty. The portions were also rather small. We spent way too much money and left unsatisfied. Won't go again if we visit the Phoenix area.",

The service was really good.  Drawbacks were it is extremely loud and hard to have a conversation, and the live band had not even started playing.   We ordered the homemade onion dip and chips which was good.  My daughter ordered the fish and chips which came out perfect. I ordered the 36 hours ribs.  The coleslaw was good but that is where it all ends.  Fries were cold and the ribs were tough and dried out.  Bbq sauce was this thick sticky mess.  Almost the consistency of peanut butter.  Ribs did not have much of a flavor.   I will give this place another try but based on this performance it is overrated.",

I was pleased and a little surprised that it wasn't too crowded at about 5:45 on a Friday. We were seated right away. The server was really nice and helpful. I was skeptical at first, because there aren't many vegetarian options, but they were happy to modify my meal. They told me about a vegetarian black bean soup and brought out a sample for me to try which was nice! The soup was really salty, and also no whole beans, and I prefer some whole beans in black bean soup. I ended up not ordering it and went for the grilled cheese sliders sans bacon. I hadn't had a grilled cheese in ages and it totally hit the spot, yum! I liked that it had tomato on it too. Plus it was a good amount of food for $10, so that was nice! The fries aren't the best. Some were mushy and some were too crispy, it was just an odd combo. But they weren't awful or anything. I'd totally come back though, good service and good food!",

Awful food served in microscopic portions.  FOOD POISONING!  My friend and I ate there around 9:00 PM this past Wednesday.  After waiting at the bar for half an hour for a table, we ordered two entrees (steak tacos and trout).  Well, the food was terrible, both in quantity and quality.  The bill was equally egregious given how terrible the food and service were.  I got home about an hour later and started feeling really bad.  I spent the next few hours hurling my guts out over the toilet.  My friend texted me saying he was also feeling sick, and he called the restaurant to complain.  They told him they'd make a note of it and see if anyone else experienced the same problems that night--no apology, no comp for the garbage meal they served...nothing.  Thanks Culinary Dropout...now I know why you're called a dropout!",

Most of the staff was polite about the situation except for one blonde girl at the hostess stand who was very rude and acted like it was my fault that they didn't have my table. Excuse me for thinking that reservations mean that you shouldn't have to wait an hour. She continually told me we were next to be seated which wasn't True. I had a party of 6, which is why we made reservations days in advance. They sat multiple other parties of 4 in front of us at tables that we saw parties of six get up from. The hostess then told me I was wrong about that. She then told me that had to seat parties in the order they arrived (what are reservations then?) and basically began ignoring me. I really tried to be polite, but when she basically accused me of lying about the parties of 6 I saw leave, I was mad.

You get a basket of large pretzel pieces and a substantial pot of cheese. More than enough for two people!  Then I had the Chicken Gorgonzola salad. It was the perfect cool dish for a hot summer day. I wish it had a few more apple slices in it, but over all it was a great salad with the perfect amount of dressing.   Our waiter was attentive, but it could have been because the restaurant was pretty empty relative to it's size. Although I imagine that it is packed on weekend nights.  I was also pleased that they brought out black napkins for me since I was wearing black pants. It was a thoughtful touch!

Our waitress was very nice, and they did not let the cups get empty..maybe you pay for the service because the food is good, but not so good that my life cant continue without it.",

We had to shout at our waitress, and still she had trouble hearing us and vice versa. I literally couldn't have a conversation with the person sitting across the table from me.  The \"vibe\" was interesting. Half the fun was looking at all of the obscurely dressed \"alternative\" crowd that was eating there. Many of the patrons seemed to give off the \"my world is a dark abyss and my parents just don't understand me\" aura. Unfortunately, I could not share my quippy observations with anyone else at my table, given the noise. The decor was pretty abhorrent, and the restaurant was uncomfortably cold (it was nighttime in early February), given that they left all the doors and windows open.  I had the trout, which was very tasty. Additionally, the pretzel bites with fondue appetizer was VERY good. At the end of the day though, I'd rather eat at Wendy's were I can actually converse, than some hipster joint where I can't hear anything other than a jazz musician (who didn't seem to fit the scene... he was the only non-white I could spot in the crowd) eating the microphone and playing the harmonica (poorly) at 10,000 deciles.",

I had the warm Italian grinder.  I really like the meats, peppers, cheese and bread but prefer my hot/warm sandwiches do not have any lettuce or tomatoes on it.  It was not mentioned on the menu so I'm warning you now.  I liked the fries, skinny and crispy.  I also tried a bite of the shaved prime rib dip and really liked it.  Other items I had a bite of: the MAC burger had quality meat but was over cooked.  We sat outside, it was the first week of November, gotta love this desert for this reason alone.  We were very comfortable and served very well by a handsome gentleman but for the life of me I cannot remember his name.  He had tattooed arms.  Oh wait, so did other servers.  They all seemed nice.  I will be back Dropout.",

    "text": "Dakota, you know the food is bad here, why would you ever eat here again?  Great question, I am so glad you asked.  Having been here a couple times and been disappointed I had never intended to give it another chance, as Sam Fox restaurants are always guaranteed to underwhelm and chains should be avoided when possible.   A friend had a birthday party and it had been at least a 1+ years since I had been, so I went in with an open mind about giving it one more shot.  A friend had a birthday party there (unfortunately I could not talk them into changing the venue) after being handed a bunch of lemons it was time to make lemonade  The evening started off somewhat promising, they actually had a craft cocktail list (trying to capitalize on the craft cocktail craze and actually doing it well are two different stories) and the Mrs went with their modified version of a French 75 (very modified) which was Aperol, Strawberry infused simple syrup, gin, sparkling wine, and I believe lemon or lime, which was drinkable but a touch light on the gin, I went with a Perfect Martinez - My criteria for this selection was the products involved:  Miller Gin (excellent) Dolin Dry Vermouth (excellent) Carapno Anticia (excellent) and orange bitters (as long as you buy decent bitters or make your own you are fine here) and what came out was a slightly orangeish martini - a bit sweet and orangey but certainly drinkable.  That combination of ingredients in almost any ratio is probably decent.  Looking at the rest of the cocktail menu everything looked overly sweet and unbalanced but I could not resist the compulsion to confirm what I already knew and against common sense went with a Singapore Sling.  Which was super sweet bright red, wrong glass, wrong garnish, wretched drink - so in conclusion stick with items in a bottle here, the cocktail menu is for looking at not ordering from  Onto the food:  The soup of the day was Chili, which was salty to the point of inedible, the fondue pretzel with cheese dipwas up next, the pretzel quality was very poor, cardboardish and bland with the cheese tasting very processed.   We ordered charcuterie for our meal (as we suspected the food would be bad - and the charcuterie at Arrogant Butcher [another Sam Fox restaurant] is solid) and that was delivered to the other end of our table (large group) so by the time they figured out what happened they were going to bring out the same order to us [because of their mistake], with the rest of everyone's main course, however the main's came out and still not charcuterie, so we ended up canceling that order (it was about 20-30 min between the mistake and the mains coming out without them correcting the error) We also got a couple of the mussel app for the table - which was fine, it is hard to mess mussels up, the broth was ok nothing exceptional  So after about 2 hours in with very little eaten or to drink other than water, a couple mussels, and a few bites of bad bread, and 1 ok cocktail - it was the most exciting time of the evening, time to go! The Bday Girl did have an excellent time which was the most important part  If you do have to go there, try not to eat anything and stick with beer or wine - and you will be ok",

We were given complimentary pretzel balls and fondue at our table as an apology for the long wait. The pretzel and fondue dish was delicious! definitely one of the best things we had on the table the entire night.  I ordered the salmon which was ok but the portion was very small. Someone ordered the gnocchi which was not good. The cannelloni was good but the portion was small...again. The salads were large and very good. To sum up the food, it was OK but not great and we were all still hungry after we left the restaurant. The music playing was also extremely loud. You can barely have a conversation in the place. We were very happy when the live music started. It was a nice touch and the band was very good. The ambiance is OK. Beautiful long tables and leather couches and gorgeous chandeliers.  I hate giving this place a bad review, but I would never spend $$$ to eat here again.",

Their happy hour is great (try the Saurkraut Martini - I swear by it), and their food is amazing.  This GastroPub serves your 'typical' bar food - with a suave twist.  Try the shaved prime rib sandwich with a cup of delicious french onion soup to dip it in.  Or try the butternut squash ravioli (soooo yummy).  Everything I have had off their menu, from apps to dinner to dessert (the monkey bread is fabulous - and NOT just because it has the word monkey in it) has been mouthwatering.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",

They should at least get smaller pots OR fill it up all the way! haha! i also had the turkey pastrami on a pretzel bun... The pretzel bun really made the sandwich unique & delicious!

    "text": "I've been to Culinary Dropout for dinner several times now and have always had a good experience. We tend to eat early so I haven't encountered the lines or service problems other reviews have mentioned. We've always been seated immediately and have had great service. A few people have mentioned the way the staff dresses; it is True that the female staff dresses somewhat.... uniquely. I'll just say the words \"wholesome family restaurant\" are probably not what comes to mind.   Anyway, all I care about is the food, which is excellent. My daughter loves the Iberico ham. Their Iberico isn't the 36-month aged acorn-fed amazing stuff you get at Robuchon, but is still quite good. My other favorites there are the Korean-style ribeye cap, fish and chips, pub burger, and fried chicken. The ribeye cap is a must-have, imho. Tender, juicy, and a unique flavor from the marinade. The batter used on the chicken and fish and chips is really nice - very light and airy, crisp and crunchy. The fish in the fish and chips is fresh and flaky. Flavors in the chicken and fish and chips aren't particularly unique or interesting, but the batter, quality ingredients, and perfect cooking really serve to elevate them. The pub burger (with bbq sauce and bacon) is flavorful and juicy. The only dish I've been disappointed with was the meatloaf. Waiters on two visits recommended the meatloaf so I broke down and tried it even though I'm not a meatloaf fan. Sad to say that after trying it I'm still not a meatloaf fan. YMMV if you're partial to meatloaf.  Drinks are a bit pricey, and I wouldn't pick this as the place to guzzle cocktails but the bar area always seems to be hopping.   Overall, one star off for lacking a bit more creativity in the menu, but four stars for solid execution on what they do have, along with very comfortable seating at both tables and booths.",

They really deserve 4.5 Stars, but it could be just that I prefer my food seasoned more.  Their menu is diversified, ingredients fresh, servers and kitchen accommodating, the vibe is hip and open.  My son ordered the huge, over-the-top yummy rack of Jalapeno Ribs, which didn't seem too spicy.  They were meaty, tender, moist and flavorful.  That's what I'm ordering my next visit!  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken that was lightly drizzled with Honey, served with Mashed Potatoes, Biscuit and I added a side of Brussel Sprouts.  The Sprouts are served cold, which I felt did not compliment their flavor.  The waiter was kind enough to heat them, but they were still slightly warm.  The Chicken could have benefited from a bit more seasoning, although it was tender and moist.  My husband ordered the Mac Burger, which he said was quite tasty.  They do have supreme French Fries and I'm not easily impressed with Fries.  All in all, the food was so good that we didn't even mind the the slow service from a first day wait staff who did one terrific job, considering he was so new.  He was friendly and had great personality.  Culinary Drop is our Scottsdale go-to that never lets us down.",

We were looking for someplace nice to mark the holiday and also celebrate our honeymoon. (But remember, we're from Tucson, so our definition of \"nice\" is a little different.)  We'd been to a few of the other Fox restaurants and wanted to try something new. Culinary Dropout was open late, and their menu looked fun.  We certainly got what we bargained for -- classic comfort foods with a twist set in an alternative atmosphere that was really enjoyable. Initially, we were worried the place was over-hyped (lots of tattooed hipsters and a dining room that could have been featured in a Rock 'n Roll issue of Dwell magazine. Luckily the decor was a compliment to the food instead of a distraction.  We got the pretzel bites with provolone fondue for an appetizer, then my husband got the meatloaf and I got the fried chicken for dinner. Ho-le-cow the food was good. I mean totally delicious and better than Mom makes (sorry, Mom).  The service was great and the food was really something to write home about. We'd definitely come here again!",

The food itself is over-spiced, unimaginative, and blah. Not to mention, I've been left running to the bathroom probably every time.

    "text": "One of the more edgy/younger/hipper of the FRC's. Hence the name.   I've been here a lot and here's what I like to do:  Start off ordering the Pretzels with Cheese Fondue and/or the House Potato Chips with onion dip. Neither of those will disappoint and go great with beer/cocktails.   Don't waste your money on the specialty drinks that outline the menu. They're all pretty expensive for what you get and I've never been truly impressed. They taste more like the bartender was a dropout. Go with beer or mixed drinks that you know. Feeling risky? Order the Brown Bag Special. You'll get a can of Natural Light, Busch Lite or PBR. A nifty novelty. On Sundays, get the bacon infused Bloody Mary. The bacon slice was bigger than the one on my burger. No joke.  I like to order the Pub Burger. It's got havarti, bacon and nice bun. Not as overwhelming as the MAC Burger. If you've had FRC burgers, these don't stray from that recipe. The Fried Chicken is greasy and incredible. Ask for extra wetnaps. I'm also a big big fan of the Turkey Pastrami sandwich. The tender meat meshes well with the bread and cheese. I'm not usually a pickle person, but for some reason the side dill pickle complements the overall flavor perfectly. Honestly, I've been satisfied with almost everything here - except the curry.  Don't go on Fri/Sat nights unless you want to wait an hour. There isn't a dress code for the waitresses/hosts so it's got a cool hipster vibe. The patio is a good place to sit on an amiable night.  Bottom line: Order your favorite drink, one or two of the appetizers, and split an entree.",

We didn't have a reservation on a weekend (we figured it would be a wait, no big deal) they told us there was a long wait for a table but the bar was open seating, they didn't even ask if we wanted to get on a list for a table which for me I thought was common courtesy. Moving on, we eventually found open seats at the bar and decided to eat there. From there it was all down hill. It was like pulling teeth to get anyone to even look at us, let alone hand us a menu to look over. We ordered an appetizer we knew they had as we were starving but beyond that felt like an inconvenience to the entire staff. I already had a drink the I got before we found seats but ordering a water was taking it too far apparently as the bartender rolled her eyes while she poured them. No one gave us plates, napkins, silverware for our shared food. Every time we would try to catch someone's attention it felt like every person behind the bar was actively trying to ignore us. I've been in the service industry and feel that I am a very understanding customer but this was flat out bad service. I shouldn't need to feel like an inconvenience when all I'm asking you to do is the job you signed up to do.",

With the demise of the Pink Taco (who could have forecasted that???) and their recently-emptied location, Culinary Dropout moved in to offer great American food at reasonable prices.    The menu is fairly limited, but with multiple iterations of cheeseburgers, very good fries, and great appetizers, there are more than enough options for the casual diners who find themselves on the Water Front.  Even though the burger and the fries were very good, I found the appetizers to be the best part of the meal.  There is an impressive assortment of meats and cheeses, so you can customize your own tapas if that is what you're into.  If you're not in the mood for a meat-and-cheese appetizer, the pretzel fondue is definitely worth a shot.  The homemade pretzels were awesome and the cheese dip puts traditional nacho cheese to shame.    I ended up at the restaurant on a random Wednesday night and the place was packed.  I feel pretty comfortable saying that given the good drink list, and affordable good food, you should expect to wait for a table unless you like to eat dinner early.",

During one visit, I ordered the pork belly cuban sandwich, which is a fantastic idea, but fails completely. The whole cut of pork belly was miniscule and shriveled. Rather than being served on a baguette of some sort, as most traditional cubanos are, which would accomodate the strip of pork belly, it is served on a roll; or, instead, they could have sliced the pork belly and layered it throughout the sandwich...but they didn't - 9 out of 10 bites won't have any pork belly in it. The sadwich is also supposed to have a \"tangy slaw\" on top - instead, mine was served with chopped iceberg lettuce...iceberg lettuce in a cubano?! You have to be kidding.   PS: their website's photo of the cubano is completely misleading - don't expect anything that looks that delicious to arrive on your plate.  On another visit, I ordered the fried chicken, which could have been amazing and delicious...if it weren't completely overcooked and saturated with burnt grease.  Culinary Dropout has the idea in place, but they need to work on their execution if they plan to stick around.  I don't expect ot ever make a return visit.",

The decor is is retro like all new restaurants are these days - tufted banquettes and wing chairs - not like the sleek modern restaurants I normally associate with Scottsdale. And the menu is of course comfort food - again like every other new restaurant.  Sandwiches, fried chicken, even a potato chip/onion dip appetizer. (Haven't had that for at least 25 years.)  Four of us went for dinner during a girls weekend on Sunday night and it really wasn't that busy considering it's high season in Phoenix.  All the food was uniformly good but nothing was terribly original or different.  I'm surprised it won a best new restaurant award from Phoenix Magazine last year.  Then again, new restaurants were few and far between last year in Phoenix.  If your goal is comfort food done well, you'll probably like this place.  And the prices are certainly more reasonable than its big sister across the street, Modern Steak.",

I had the fried chicken, and it was lightly drizzled with honey, and quite delicious.   I also had the pretzel fondue and that was quite tasty too!  The decor is quite hip, the bar area would have been nice to have high top tables for the times you want to have a cocktail and mingle standing, and that is not an option.  Sit at a table or the bar...those are your options!",

We sat outside in a super cute corner couch/table area. The food was good and the service was good but it was not exceptional. We got the chicken (yum) and the grilled cheese was fabulous too. Excellent string fries! We liked the comfort food aspect to the menu. We ended with the Monkey bread. The server told us it would be 15 minutes but somehow it was cooked double time because it came out less than ten minutes later. The Monkey Bread came with a scoop of ice cream and it was shear heaven. I would come back here to skip dinner and go strait for the Monkey Bread!",

Our server (didn't catch her name) was extremely helpful in offering some great suggestions of what to try. I went with the turkey sandwich with coleslaw on pretzel bread (but I got the mustard on the side). I love pretzel bread! It was a great choice and delicious. Fries were good too, although nothing special. And, the price was just right. My friend liked her dish as well - the chicken salad with pears and Gorgonzola. I'd definitely go back to try more of the menu.",

I thought the decor was very nice and would typically expect higher prices on the menu...both pluses in my book!  Service was wonderful with great reccomendations.  The table started with the pretzel fondu, which was yummy!  Our dinners arrived before we finished the fondu, which would normally bug me, but it saved me from getting full from the appetizer.  I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and thought it was delicious.  Liked it enough that I would definitely order again next time I visit!  Please tell Mr. Sam Fox to opena a culinary dropout in Denver!",

    "text": "I would like to give this place 2.5 stars, but that is not an option.   Let me start by saying that this place is new, so there is room / a grace period for improvement.  With that said, I just wasn't that impressed.  This is not to say the food wasn't good or the service was bad, it just didn't stand out to me.  On a very positive note, it is beautifully decorated and the patio rocks.  I will start with the food.  My friend and I met here for \"happy hour\"; we didn't learn until after we sat down and got comfy, they don't have one.  Even Morton's has happy hour, why don't you???  That kind of irked me since I'm always on a budget seeing as how I go out every night.  Anyways, we each got a glass of wine, easy peasy and we started to peruse the menu.  Let me tell you, this is not a vegetarian friendly place.  I am not a vegetarian, but I am VERY picky about my meats.  We ordered a cheese plate with olives to start, good, but kind of pricey for what you get.  And, I wish the waitress would have told us that the two we picked out were very similar.  She was very informative and helpful when we asked her questions, but I guess she didn't feel like offering up this tidbit.  After the appetizer, we both ordered salads as our entrees.  I had the smoked chicken salad and my dining companion had the chopped salad.  Both were very good and decent sized for entrees.  The only complaint I had was there was a little too much dressing, but that can be easily fixed.  I would say, all in all, the food was good, but not great.  I guess I was just expecting something more.  For three women to spend $80 on dinner, it probably should have been a little more impressive.  I am a big fan of Sam Fox and I think this place has potential, I think they just need a little bit of time.  I don't know if I will be going back any time soon.  I know I won't suggest it (maybe if someone else does).  Or, maybe I will give it a month or two and try it again after they work out the kinks.",

The prices are what I expected since it is located by Fashion Square in Scootsdale. The service was decent. The server seemed to have a slight attitude which always bothers me because I used to be a server and am nothing but nice to the staff at restaurants.

We were actually told they turn up the volume of the music to \"drowned out\" the kitchen noise to which we responded we'd rather hear the kitchen noise.  The food was ok and the service was good - except for the volume situation. The mule was the best we've have in a long time.  Too bad about the music - and, no, this was not the live music.

Delicious.  Prepared perfectly, well balanced... not too much beef, bread was fresh and not overwhelmed, nor overwhelming, and the bacon, garlic et al were the perfect compliment.  My daughter loved her grilled steak salad, dressing and seasoning was again well balanced.

It was actually around 7-10min wait. Our waitress arrived shortly after and was super nice. We sat outside and it was a beautiful breeze alongside the misters.  We ordered drinks apps and entrees and everything came out in a reasonable time. I ordered the crispy shrimp kale Caesar salad and it was delicious!!! My husband ordered and ribs and I'll just say, all that was left were the bones! Lol  I was surprised that I asked the hostess where the bathroom was and instead of just pointing, she walked me to the bathroom. That level of service was impressionable in my opinion. That alone made me give the 5 stars. Granted it was late and an hour before they closed, it was still a very nice gesture! When I return to Scottsdale, I'll be back!",

This is a noisy place so if that's not Your thing this isn't the place for you. Also the service could be better. My friend had to flag the waiter down regarding where her 2nd drink was she ordered. It's probably a tad overpriced but based on its location I can see why",

We had burgers and we split, the waiter was nice enough to bring the food out already split.  Burger was tasty and cooked correctly.  The ranch was amazing if you like garlic.  Would definitely go back again.  Only issue/frustration is the hostess tried to seat us right next to a couple where the tables were almost on top of each other.  If they were busy totally would make sense but they weren't so we asked to be moved.",

Overall, the food was okay--not the foodie experience we had hoped for based on reviews.  Maybe our palates were impacted by the frustration of poorly timed delivery and customer service.

When Manager Haley and Chef Raymond found out that I had been unable to try their ribs during my first visit, they invited me back to the restaurant so that I could get the entree that I had been reading about on yelp. I accepted their invitation and was amazed at the level of service I received during my return visit.   Sam (I think she's a manager) already knew I was coming and communicated with the very nice server (I AM SO SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME!!) that I was back to try the ribs. My friends and I indulged in the house chips and French Onion Dip, prosciutto deviled eggs, and grilled cheese sliders.. They're all so excellent, it's really hard to pick a favorite.   Then the ribs came out...personally...by the EXECUTIVE CHEF!!!  Seriously made me feel like a VIP. Needless to say, the ribs were amazing, even better than I thought they would be!   This review was to acknowledge the hospitality and high level of service of Culinary Dropout's team. Their food is amazing, the ambiance is relaxing and interesting...but seriously, the service is exceptional.",

The antipasti \"choose your platter\" menu is delicious. It's a nice choice for when you don't want heavy food- but it's expensive. The best thing on the menu, hands down, is the fried chicken. My partner and I asked to share it and our lovely waitress even split the fried chicken up on two plates for us...for no charge. Such a nice gesture. We each got a full serving of the sides that go with it- even each getting our own warm and buttery biscuit. We left happy but not as painfully full as we normally am after stuffing our faces with their fried chicken. Other notable menu items are the soft pretzels, pierogis, and nachos.",

Mother-daughter lunch New Year's day. Walked in to a not-too-full, not-too-empty restaurant at 1:30.  Hostess was charming....and our waitress was as well. Very, very good service.  Ordered the chips and dip (again) - they were perfect.  I see I wrote last time they were a little greasy....this time we couldn't stop commenting about how NOT greasy they were. Perfectly browned, crispy and delicious. Plus we swore the basket kept refilling itself. No matter how much we ate it never seemed like it was disappearing.  Weird.  Daughter had the grilled cheese sliders (with bacon and tomato) and liked it a lot.  I had the seared tuna salad....and here's where I'm going to get picky.  The whole thing was waaaaayyy too cold. Especially the lettuce.  I felt like the flavors had absolutely no chance to work together to create a deeper flavor.  Towards the end, as it almost came to room temperature, I started to actually be able to taste the flavors of the tuna, the light dressing, the avocado, the cashews and the wasabi balls (or whatever those are called). Please....don't serve this salad that cold.....it truly does make it fairly flavorless. Also - the wasabi thing-a-ma-jiggys really didn't add anything - the cashews gave me a crunch - put a little wasabi in the dressing if you want that flavor in there.  I'd still come back - I like the atmosphere, the service, and definitely the menu choices.",

    "text": "I requested to go to CD for my birthday.  I absolutely LOVE their pretzels and cheese.  They aren't anything super fancy, but it's one of my favs!  My turkey reuben had a somewhat soggy bun from the cole slaw but was still excellent.  I also got a free dessert for my bday- not something every restaurant does anymore.  The table shared a salted caramel custard which was garnished with caramel corn- AMAZING!  And i'm not much of a fan of salted caramel.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, this location is so LOUD!  It's really difficult to hear when you are inside, even when they don't have live music.  The tables are so big, it's hard to have conversation with anyone who isn't directly across from you.  Might need to rethink design....",

The pretzels were only hot on the top of the top layer no doubt from a heat lamp.  They were cold inside.  Otherwise they had a good flavor.   For the main course I had the fried chicken.  The chicken was not worth the wait.  The French fries were burnt,  the Cole slaw was nasty, and the biscuit was cold,  although the butter was melted.  My wife had the prime rib and was not impressed either.   The 2 stars are for our waitress.  She was really nice and she can't be responsible for the menu",

I felt very uncomfortable with half naked women walking around in what I thought was a \"nice\" restaurant.. it just seemed very unprofessional.   We had a coupon for free pretzel fondue, which we've had before and loved! I can't believe it's 10 dollars though. Really?! It can't possibly cost more than $2 to make.   I ordered the pub burger and was completely unimpressed. I asked for well done and the meat was pink inside and oozing liquid which made me bun soggy (gross). Also, there was barely any BBQ sauce... I couldn't even taste it. The pickle was delicious.. and the fries were below average.   My husband got the grilled chicken club and didn't care for it.   Ultimately, there was nothing on the menu that we were excited about... Nothing sounded good. (besides the over priced pretzel fondue).  I doubt we will go back, there are so many other choices out there.   OH AND THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD!!!!!!!",

I walked up to the front of the bar just as a couple of gals were leaving and scored premium bar seats.  Time to get my drink on so I order up a Chimay Premiere (Red). A Trappist beer from a Monastery brewhouse in southern Hainaut, Belgium. $9. Poured from the bottle into a goblet shows a hazy, orangish amber. Taste is complex. There is vast malty sweet wandering all over but in balance. A world class beer.  Next cheese and meat for a little appetizer. I order up Humboldt Fog $6. An elegant, soft, surface ripened cheese. The texture is creamy and luscious with a subtle tangy flavor. Capicola $5. A delicious mild pork cold cut that comes with a few pieces of chewy Italian bread. No entrees tonight, just more beer.   The designer in me was so impressed with the decor of this house because good design involves attention to even the smallest of details. There were so many strong patterns, colors, and textures. The stage is well done and the B&W photography from legendary musicians like the Boss are stunning. The energy in this house is very hip.  What a flat-out scorching date night.",

The menu is pricier and the restaurant is beautiful- with hanging chandeliers and cute lounge chairs for seating- but the people in there aren't very dressed up, most wearing workout clothes. My boyfriend and I dressed up because we had been to a different location and it was much fancier so it was disappointing to feel \"overdressed\" at such a beautiful place.

The fondue was more of a congealed cheese wiz, not a fondue and the restaurant should have been ashamed to serve it as it was inedible. The service was also lack luster.

There are certainly things to love . . . the expansive outdoor patio with some of the most comfortable seating around. It's great for people-watching as it fronts Camelback Road, just across the street from Scottsdale Fashion Square. On a hot and hazy summer afternoon, we were still very content sitting on the patio.  On the negative side . . . The food was not even so-so.  I expected so much more from a Sam Fax Restaurant. We have been fans for years with True Food, North, The Greenhouse and the now-closed Bloom, and they are on our regular dining rotation.  Culinary Dropout was how its name sounded, someone dropped the culinary part when they made our meals. I had a hard time finding something that even sounded appetizing on the menu!  We started with the potato chips and onion dip. Nothing to write home about, although I think that if I had a real salt craving, these might just satisfy it. Maybe I should have ordered the pretzel and provolone fondue . . .   For an entree I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and mushroom . . . sure sounded like a winner . . . NOT! The gnocchi and sauce were pretty tasteless, and the mushrooms and sausage were so salty I couldn't eat them. Mix them all together and it tasted even worse. My husband ordered the Beef Stroganoff and was very disappointed.  There was no sour cream taste whatsoever. Boring was what he called it.  So the food is not up to par with the rest of the Fox restaurants, but the worst part was the service. The place was pretty empty, and while our server was attentive to our needs prior to our order, after our food was delivered, he pretty much disappeared -- no water refills, no iced tea refills . . . nothing. On a 106 degree day, that should never happen on the patio!!  Needless to say, we won't be making any trips back to Culinary Dropout!",

    "text": "What happened? I hate writing bad reviews more than anything because I love promoting local business. I hate writing bad reviews for restaurants I've previously had amazing experiences at even more.      To say the least, customer service here, at least last night, was horrendous. We arrived at peak dining hours--around 6:30, and knew we wouldn't be able to glide right in to a table so a wait was understandable. The first hostess was friendly enough and told us it would be about an hour and a half to two hour wait. We ordered drinks from the bar (really good!) the el diablo and the beer shandy and snagged seats at the outdoor bar. The bartender was a little arrogant and sarcastic which could definitely put some patrons off, but whatever, I had a good drink and can handle some snarky comments.      What killed me was when I went to check on our position in the line around 8:30. I walked up and all three hostesses were standing there talking and acted like I was intruding in on their conversation. She told me it would be another forty five minutes to an hour. Hadn't we already been sitting and waiting for 2 hours? I was annoyed and put off by this. We decided to leave the bar and stand in the lobby. To my distaste I watched as the main hostess greeted three men and when they asked how long the wait would be she responded \"everyone is canceling, it shouldn't take long\". I get it. Young hostesses want to flirt with cute guys, but c'mon. Customers are standing right in front of you that have been for much longer than \"it won't take long\".        Finally seated at 9pm. The food was delicious and our waitress was speedy and friendly. What a shame that I left with a bad taste in my mouth, and an even bigger shame for my friend that I brought who had never been here before. Not a great first impression for her.",

    "text": "I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to patronize an establishment called Culinary Dropout in the silicone cultural wasteland of Scottsdale. In a hipster mecca like San Francisco, Seattle or Brooklyn I'd just assume it was ironic but I wasn't sure the target audience would get it.  I'm not sure if it counts as de-gentrification but at least the management gets it.   Culinary Dropout is, straight up, excellent American comfort food at prices that aren't overall comforting but are reasonable for the neighborhood. The staff, for which a minimum beauty and/or edge standard is strictly enforced (the explanation that best explains a visible mohawk in the open kitchen) are friendly and help it along in a cavernous, moodlit dining room suitable for friends or a date along with a bar boasting live music on weekends and the obligatory fair-weather outdoor seating.  We hit two of the three specialties (the third being a turkey pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread) and a dessert: - Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue ($10): There's a reason everyone orders this. Fluffy pretzel rolls that are made better with a *small* amount of warm cheese. - Fried Chicken ($16): What must be multiple pounds of juicy chicken (I'm not sure I'd want to meet the chicken to which the breast piece belonged in a dark alley) with honey-glazed biscuits, mashed potatoes and cole slaw. - Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart ($6): For lovers of dense and sweet desserts only.  Especially if considering dessert, I'd strongly recommend ordering the pretzels and then one dish less than the number of people - comforting in the United States means heavy and even if I'd just hiked 10+ miles after not eating all day I don't think I could have finished the entire chicken platter. I just as strongly recommend coming though - it is one of the rare cases where my traditionalist meat and potatoes parents and I agree on a restaurant. Culinary Dropout has enough of a sense of humor as it can possibly maintain among plastic \"charm\" and the food makes me a bit wistful for whatever the chef would have produced had s/he not called it quits.",

At least three times I ordered something from the waitress that didn't come, and when I asked about my order she replied \"oh, I wasn't sure you wanted it\".  The food was okay, the table shared the pretzels and beer cheese, which tasted a bit like melted Kraft American cheese slices.  I ordered the grilled cheese sliders from the happy hour menu and they were adorable mini-sandwiches.  However (!) the menu said their grilled cheese came with bacon, but apparently the sliders don't.  So it was just bread and a butt-load of cheese, but still tasty.  I ordered the Gypsy Shandy and it was DELICIOUS.  The way it was described was rum and a splash of Mexican soda, but it tasted like lemonade, pina colada, and rainbows.  I had as many as I could fit in before HH ended, then switched to the brown bag special, which was a mystery selection can of beer in a brown bag for less than $2.  All in all it was a nice experience, but with all the selections to choose from in Old Town, I'm not sure this is the best.",

    "text": "Oh boy. I did it again. I tried one of those uber-trendy downtown Scottsdale eateries. Which resulted in mixed feelings.  Atmosphere was a bit frenzied to me. I don't think that is what they are going for but it wasn't very relaxing.  Our server was very personable and helpful with the menu.  Our cocktails were amazing. Pricey but worth every penny. My husband had a whiskey drink and I had a gin drink. Forgot the names but they were awesome and extremely creative.  We started out with the pretzels and cheese fondue. Oh so good. Piping hot salty fluffy pillows of pretzel dipped in gooey, delicious cheese fondue. And a huge portion... enough for about 4 people. It's good that the portion was big because of what happened next...  I ordered the chopped vegetable salad. The menu says it contains corn, avocado, artichoke, asparagus, pistachios, and Parmesan. I was envisioning something similar to the chopped salad at Cowboy Ciao as far as vegetable content. What I got was mostly lettuce, a little bit of asparagus, corn, and pistachios, some beets (which was not mentioned on the menu and I can't stand), and barely any dressing and Parmesan. Absolutely no avocado or artichoke. Trust me I spent 10 minutes picking through the salad looking at it.   In the server's defense he offered to bring me another salad which I declined. I filled up on pretzels while picking through my salad and I was already full. He offered to bring me a free dessert which again I declined because of my pretzel filled belly.   My husband's grilled cheese sliders were passable. Good fries.   My gripes are with the kitchen who completely missed two key ingredients... to a hungry vegetarian this is a sin. Also with management. I only ate 1/4 of the salad. I didn't want a new one or dessert. I paid $12 for a bowl of lettuce. The salad being comped should have been a given. And trust me I am not a complainer as most of my reviews are 4 or 5 stars.  All that being said, I do really want to give CD another try. Their drinks were exquisite and judging by the pretzels I know they probably have some other good menu items up their sleeve... but their chopped vegetable salad isn't one of them.",

I don't think it was anything to really write home about.  I think people get oohed and awed by the decor, which is totally trendy and cool (and dark).  The pretzels were yummy, but I don't even remember what I ate - which is something you would normally remember at a really great place.   Overall we were happy with our meal, but I felt as though for all the hype I should have been wowed.  Maybe I need to give it another chance.   I will say my drink that our server recommended was amazing.",

Finally it was determined that our pager was not working...really annoying. They didn't even bother to apologize.   As for the food - wow! The pretzels were amazing! The beer was good too. I would definitely go again - just on a different night. The servers in the restaurant was nice enough. Parking is ample and they have live music on Saturday nights. It seemed more like a bar type of atmosphere based on the amount of flirting/pick up lines going on.  All in all this place would receive 4 stars if the service wasn't so terrible up front. The food is really good, but there is no reason to be snobby about it!",

We had Cory as our server, and he was not only incredibly knowledgable about the food and how it's prepared, but he cracked us up and made us laugh throughout dinner without disrupting the flow of the meal and our evening out with friends. He was there when we needed him but also wasn't in our faces and unnecessarily interruptive. I would definitely recommend Culinary Dropout to any foodies looking to check out a new option or return to a really solid restaurant. We were very impressed and will return for sure!",

    "text": "First, I never drink whiskey unless it's St. Patrick's Day. I had a painful end to a long week and decided to switch to something other than my usual vodka. The Smashed Irishman lives up to it's name. The honey makes it smooth and sweet, but I could feel it workin' it's magic on me. I got it on the recommendation of our sever. He was wonderful, although I got a little jealous when two girls sat down at our communal table and he gave them the same flirty treatment. You know flattery gets you everywhere, don't deny it.    I decided to give the gnocchi a try since it is my absolute favorite thing in the world. Well, Avanti's gnocchi is my absolute favorite and I wanted to do a little comparison. Culinary does it with sausage and mushrooms. It is delicious, although heavy. The sausage made it salty, but in a good way. I still must say that I love Avanti's version more and probably always will. Nothing beats them, NOTHING. Why am I so obsessed with their gnocchi? I think they put some sort of drug in it.   Those two flirty girls next to me started with the grilled cheese sliders and again, my side of the table was jealous. Actually, they ate a surprising amount of food so I got to see a lot of what Culinary Dropout had to offer. Back to my side of the table, the butternut squash cannelloni was to die for (according to my friend, I did not taste it) and the fried chicken was better than KFC...  so, I guess everyone was at least satisfied.",

    "text": "3.5 stars   Those of you from the Silicon Valley.. this place is like downtown Campbell on a Saturday night mixed in with some Los Gatos-esqueness thrown in with some 90s jams (think Oasis, Beck) as ambiance music  1. when I think gastropub I think tavern...what I got was something out of Santana Row in San Jose, CA.  2. Service was average  3. Seating was fun (cushy chairs and sofas)  4. The guy in the Ed Hardy shirt playing covers was really good  5. The food:   I got the onion soup which was super light...the onions were caramelized well and their natural sweetness came through (I usually like a more beer stout onion soup dealio but after a day's worth of flying this was perfect.   I also got the artichoke salad which has more endive and asparagus than artichoke. It is a light salad.. the Parmesan cheese does not over power and the salad is properly seasoned.   The BF got the butternut squash pasta which he thoroughly enjoyed.   Other members got the fried chicken which looked yummy and the ribs which also looked good.   Overall:  Not a bad experience.... there are tons of heat lamps on the patio, lots of flat screens to watch games etc (in our case the opening ceremony of the Olympics). Their drink menu has some interesting items like bacon bloody marys and infused fru fru like drinks.  Decent way to start off our first night in Az.",

The french onion soup was just a bit too viscous.  The gnocchi my gf got was really dry, but I remember another time it being awesome.  The different cocktails are fanciful and tasty.  I'm usually a scotch on the rocks person, but their acai mojito and bloody marys are great wake me ups.  Ambiance + Drinks are great.  Food is meh.

She knew we were out of town and took the time to suggest and write out things places to eat!

    "text": "What a great improvement to this space! The Waterfront area is really adding to the number of unique dining choices with the addition of Culinary Dropout. Given that it was opening night, I was still expecting the experience to be rough around the edges. However, you would have thought the restaurant had been open for months.   The decor is pure Sam Fox. Large chairs, interesting textures and some great chandeliers.  They have successfully shaken the gaudy ghosts of Pink Taco. Happily, they have done so with the menu, as well.   We were promptly seated and met by Michelle, our server. She was very well versed in all aspects of the menu, including the drinks. I tried the Home-Ec Martini, which I found to be tasty and not too sweet. While others at our table went with more traditional wine and cocktail choices, they were all wowed as I passed my drink around and had them sample.   For starters, the Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue jumped off the page at us. Yes, it was as good as it sounds. We also had some Prosciutto and Gorgonzola antipasti, which was a surprisingly large serving for the price. A great start to the meal!   Unlike my boring dining companions (who ordered salads....boo!), I wanted to try an entree. I peppered Michelle with questions. Her overwhelming choice was the Kurobuta Pork Ribs, which she said were marinated overnight and just \"fell off the bone\".   Let me digress for a moment. I generally don't like ribs of any type; the main reason being that they are messy and hard to deal with. Sure, they're tasty...but the effort-to-reward ratio is just to high. Still, Michelle made an impressive sales pitch, so I relented. Let me just say that my fingers didn't touch one drop of sauce. I was able to easily fork the meat off the bone......incredibly tender and tasty. If you just give a sideways glance to these ribs, the meat falls off the bone. Hands down the best rib eating experience I have ever had. Michelle, you were right....I was wrong.   It's worth noting that for my second drink of the evening, I couldn't resist the \"Paper Bag Special\" for $1.95. While Culinary Dropout has a great beer selection, I just had to give this a try. In this case, it ended up being a can of PBR, delivered in a small brown paper bag. Several servers stopped by to marvel at my fine tastes....apparently, I was one of the first to go with this option. Michelle informed us that the actual beer offered as the \"Paper Bag Special\" will vary over time. So, you never know what you may get. I've never felt quite so classy.   Lastly, I insisted we try the desert; specifically the Apple Monkey Bread, which Michelle described to us as \"cinnamon roll meets apple pie, served with a side of vanilla ice cream\". It is baked to order, so we had to wait for 15 minutes for it to arrive. When it did, it was hot and fresh.....my dining companions, who had eschewed desert, suddenly found room.....and it was devoured.   All in all, a great dining experience. I am a fan of Sam Fox restaurants. Some I like better than others, but they all offer a unique and fun experience. Still, my expectations were exceeded by Culinary Dropout. This ones a real winner and I can't wait to go back.",

Props to the servers we talked to as they were very annoyed they had empty tables when it was obvious there was people waiting.",

    "text": "Have been wanting to try this place for awhile, so I took my mom for mother's day.  I made a reservation via open table, for 3 pm the Saturday before.  It's a great space.  Lots of indoor and outdoor seating, and not your typical tables.  Big, comfy chairs and big tables.  Music was louder than what should be at 3 pm, suggesting a night club atmosphere, and with the big tables, it was hard to hear conversation.  Food was \"fantastic\" as my 15 year old daughter said.  She had the fried chicken.  My husband ordered the meatloaf, which he said was almost as good as my mom's.  :)  Since she was dining with us, that was more to save face, I think.  I ordered the kale salad with grilled chicken, which I thought tasted like a True Food salad.  (exactly what I would want)  My dad had the french dip, he enjoyed it.  My mother ordered the gorgonzola salad, with grilled chicken.  This is where it gets....not so good.  Her salad came with lettuce and chicken.  No cheese.  We looked for our waiter for quite some time, and finally flagged down a hostess.  Our waiter came back, only to explain that the cheese is mixed in with a chicken \"salad\" and since she ordered grilled chicken, they don't mix the cheese in with that.  He could give her some cheese, but it would be an up charge.  My mom is 70, and with that age comes a bit of frugality.  She knew I was paying for lunch, but didn't want me to get charged and \"up charge\" for it, so she got a little....mad.  The waiter brought over the cheese sauce they use for the chicken salad, and she put it on her salad and liked that.  There wasn't an up charge for the sauce.    A little bit of drama that didn't need to happen.  From both parties, IMO.",

I'd have to give it a third try for dinner but I definitely like the decor and found the food to be good.   At dinner it was packed and we had to wait but not more than 15-20 minutes and had some drinks at the bar. I had the ricotta gnocchi which was delicious. The beer selection was great as well with beers I usually don't find elsewhere.  Lunch was great too. Decided to go a little lighter and had the smoked chicken salad. The waiter was kind enough to tell me there was mustard in the sauce, something I usually dislike, but decided to not change or ask for anything specific. Very good with pears,chicken, pistachios and gorgonzola cheese.  Only negative so far is the awkward seats inside. They seemed a little low and bulky for the tables, that's just me being nit picky though.",

I've had a few things on the menu ( soft pretzels & provolone Fondue,  Chicken Curry,  36 Hour pork rib,  Butternut squash Cannelloni, and Bistro Steak).  All were extremely delicious and fantastic!!  We shared plates and the chef split the portions up for us. WOW!! As far as drinks go, my fave has to be the Acai Mojito.  It's one of those drinks that taste so good and before you know you are having number 3 and BOOM your drunk. LOL!   The salty caramel desert is DIVINE!! Creamy custard goodness!!  I highly RECOMMEND this place! The decor is unique, mismatch furniture  and extravagant chandeliers. GENIUS!",

    "text": "Just left here, and I will never go back. I've been to Culinary Dropout at this location many times and had good experiences. Not this time. As my mom and I walk in, the girl working there immediately asks what name is down for the reservation. I had to stop myself from laughing as the place was DEAD. At 4 pm on a Saturday there's about 6 tables of people. We told her we didn't have any and she says \"I have a table outside but I'll need it back by 5:15.\" It's too cold to eat outside, literally NO ONE is eating outside. We tell her we want a table inside and she contemplates this as if it's the hardest task she's ever been dealt. She tells us there's an open table (wow really???) but she'll need it back by 5:15 for people who DO have reservations. Keep in mind, the place is dead. We tell her fine and as I'm sitting down at the table she goes \"now remember I'll need this table back by 5:30 at the latest.\" At this point, I was ready to tell the bimbo off. The service was slow, the restaurant was freezing, and we were rushed by multiple waiters. One wait came and asked me if I wanted a box after about 10 minutes and I asked him if he could give me a honey mustard to go and he literally TAKES MINE WHILE IM STILL EATING and puts it in a to go container. What the fuck????? This isn't some cheap restaurant. I was also pretty aggravated by this idiot who again seats another family while reminding them they need to leave. The waitress took about 5 minutes to initially come to our table so we told her we were on a time crunch via the hostess. She seemed very confused by this and went and talked to he hostess. The father and daughter next to us heard this and said they were also told at 3:30 when they arrived they'd need to leave by 5. I've NEVER had a hostess or waiter tell me I needed to leave a restaurant before, especially before I ever sat down. I don't believe for one second all of the tables were reserved and if they were, it's not uncommon for someone with reservations to wait 5-10 minutes after arrival. If you can't figure out how to time your tables and treat customers who are paying highly inflated prices at your hipster restaurant, you shouldn't be working in the restaurant industry. Not to mention this was my mom and I's birthday dinner, but ya know, the waitstaff is more preoccupied on the customers who aren't even there yet.",

    "text": "Let's get the cons out of the way:    I know it's Phoenix, but winter nights get cold. You would figure they would invest in a few stand heaters for the game area. It was so cold last night that they sent the staff in the game area home. Which sucks because that's where our birthday party was.   The fire pit/couch areas are taken. All the time. I can't even imagine what time you have to get there to snag one.   The wait to get a table...there aren't words. People were in line forever, and it was bitter cold, since (you guessed it) no heaters out front either.  And now for the great stuff:  The pretzel balls (it's like 4 bites per ball!) and cheese fondue were delicious. Unfortunately the outside temperature meant the fondue was pretty solid in 10 minutes. Still, great flavor.  The fried chicken was insane. Crunchy, delicious perfection in every bite with just a kiss of honey to top it off. The potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. Only downside was that my whole plate was cold about 2-3 bites in. Still, absolutely great.  I had the Sauvignon Blanc since I didn't have a drink menu, but the people who ordered beer seemed happy with it.   In short, if you can figure out the \"off\" nights so you can get inside quickly for a table, or if you know how to get a fire pit table this place is amazing.",

    "text": "So glad we went here for dinner while on vacation.  Such a fun, different place that we probably wouldn't have chose had my by's friend not suggested it.  We played 'restaurant' before going, so we knew a majority of what was on the menu and had an idea of what we wanted.    Cute atmosphere, and deco.  Super friendly hostess and wait staff.  Bathrooms (womens) were clean and decorated to match the style of the restaurant.    We sat outside and our party had a few drinks to start.  Gin & tonic, and the vodka/grapefruit/cran/lemon cocktail. Highllllly recommended.    We only got the pretzel fondue for an appetizer, but I think we could have just eaten them.  Pretzels were warm and soft and covered in the perfect amount of sea salt.  The candle under our cheese blew out upon arrival, but I don't think a tea light would have kept the cheese warm and melty for too long anyway.  Maybe a mini-sterno??  Still, those were sooooo good.    Our party had the fried chicken, turkey pastrami, and shaved prime rib dip for dinner.  The review on the fried chicken was 'good, but not the best I've had'.  Thought I didn't eat it, to me it looked like it was really dark, maybe almost over fried?  Turkey pastrami... 'Good, but hard to eat'. It was a huge sandwich, and though I've been told I have a big mouth....don't think I could have made it fit very gracefully.  I had the shaved prime rib dip...loved it.  I hadn't had a French dip style sandwich in a long time, and I love prime rib so I went for it.  Great bread and a yummy melted cheese on top.  Cut in half and easy to dunk in the nice big bowl of a jus.  The fries were rated an over all 'meh' by our group.  I've had better.  These were small and thin.  I'd rather have had a seasoned steak fry.    But again, very cute and trendy place with some very yummy food.  I'd go here again in a heart beat.",

The corn, avocado, kale, and beet salad was one of the best salads I have ever eaten. I added a piece of roasted salmon and it was cooked to perfection. The portions are huge and I was flying home the next day, otherwise I would have taken mine home to eat again.  We did not order the pretzel and cheese dip, but we saw it brought out to a bunch of tables and it looked really good.  They also have really interesting cocktails, of their own creation. I had this cider drink with lemon flavor and something else added. I wish I knew the name because I would order this a million times over. The also offer a surprise beer in a brown bag for $1.95. Too cute. It is actual served in a brown bag, but it happened to be a Milwaukee brew.  We had a small issue with the bill not matching the menu price, but that was corrected once we brought it to their attention. This cost them a star because if we hadn't noticed then they would have up charged us.  We had a great meal and incredible drinks here. This is a great spot for groups or even a date night.",

Whatever meat was in the salad was diced up close the size of a sea salt grain. It was so tiny that I tasted no meat, and was still hungry after.

The food is not sophisticated, once again, by design, but there is something for everyone. Good selection of on tap beers and an entertaining bar staff.

Give it a whirl and your tastebuds will thank you later and then you can go ahead and send me a thank you after you indulge in this lovely dessert!",

It was a live singer and it was more like being in a nightclub than a restaurant. The food was easy going and tasty. The pretzels were large and delicious and the cheese sauce was tasty. I had the steak which was tasty but tepid and my husband had the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll which was a house favorite and he loved it. The service was attentive and it was a fun evening. Just one or two decibels less on the music.",

    "text": "This place is famous/popular for the Fried Chicken.  - I don't quite get why they are famous for it... it's VERY salty. It's also a little dry. I am not a fan of the fried chicken - go to KFC or Chuch's if you want delicious fried chicken. If you like your fried chicken very salty and on the drier side, this dish might be right for you. However, the biscuits are delicious - they drizzle honey on it and I love the sweetness of it. The mashed potatoes just taste like regular mashed potatoes. So out of this entire dish, I like the biscuit with hone the most.   The sweet corn cannelloni is AMAZING. I love the sweetness and gooeyness of the cannelloni. However, I didn't like the stuff that came with it. So the cannelloni is amazing but they have some onions and peppers cooked on top, it tasted weird to me. It was bitter or something. I don't know but just eat the sweet corn cannelloni and don't waste your time trying to figure out what else is going on in the dish.   I like this place. I would return for the sweet corn - cute place.  The waitress was amazingly friendly and nice. She built a rapport with us and went over the dishes in detail about what it included. Great service! She also has a great attitude and positive upbeat personality which added to our experience. We asked for a candle b/c we couldn't see the menu and she found us one.",

Most disappointing part was they charged me for the burger and did not offer anything to compensate for our ruined meal .   My friend had to eat alone and so did I.

There are a decent number of happy hour drink and food choices. We had a beer and the cheese plate. The cheese plate seemed like a good deal but only included cheese and nothing else so we ordered some bread too which made it pricey for happy hour. All the cheeses were good except the pimento cheese which was mediocre. We next had the kale salad and that was delicious! Great even without the dressing. My husband had both the ribs and fried chicken. The ribs are cooked amazing but the sauce is a bit sweet for my taste. The fried chicken seasoning was good but the chicken was dry. I had the Chile stew which had all the right blend of ingredients with a well cooked beef. However I would say the dish was too salty. If the salt was dialed down then I would have loved it. Our waitress was top notch...super friendly and helpful...this was definitely the best part  Bottom line...great service here, mediocre food and good ambience for happy hour   Pros Location  Service!! Kale salad  Ambience for a drink or happy hour   Cons  Ribs were too sweet Fried chicken too dry  Stew was too salty",

We ordered fried chicken and 36h smoked bbq ribs. These were their specialty which was indicated with stars on their menu. Now the food took long time until it came out but it did not bother us too much since we noticed that other people were having similar issue. The fried chicken was good but little sweet for my taste. The ribs were also good but nothing special. I was expecting little more than an average since it was bit upscale place with good reviews.",

    "text": "Had a nice dinner here after some serious Black Friday shopping. In hipster fashion our male server had a pony tail but greeted us with enthusiasm. This Scottsdale location is close to the waterfront & has nice patio seating. We sat under the heaters outside the ambianance was on point.  Food 4/5: * Pretzel with fondue. Nice app to share more like pretzel size buns. Soft bread inside! slighty salty * 36 hour ribs! -fall off the bone tender, Flinstone-size for the meat eaters! * Prime rib dip- Broth was nice and light. Fries were okay a little over but the sandwich tasted like a fancier Philly-cheese steak.   But overall, Culinary Dropout is a winner and I can see why it's so popular good food, nice ambiance  and great service.",

Waited incredibly long for an appetizer, let alone our entree's.   Quality of the food was okay and I cannot bag on the back of house. The front of house employees are what ruins the entire experience. The service is mediocre and EXTREMELY SLOW. If you wish to go anywhere after this please attend this location before noon as you will not leave for hours based off the speed of the staff that works here. Server did not refill my soft drink. Server did not check in and make sure our food tasted okay. Server did not ask if we need anything else after dropping entree's. Server can not be found 90% of the time while we were there. WHERE IS OUR SERVER?? Your servers should be readily available to the guests Incase they need something! That is rule 1 of food service. Really people? It doesn't take someone who knows food service to understand that the staff here is not hustling and working hard.   Please have a meeting with the staff here. EMBARRASSING/POOR SERVICE!!!",

    "text": "Happy Hour: Monday - Friday 3-6pm HH Specials: $4 sangrias, $4 wells, $5 cheap wines  Although I love a good happy hour, we just couldn't fit it into our schedule to stop by during their HH window so we opted for a Sunday dinner. We chose right because we managed to get a seat for two with no wait at 7pm!   To start off, we got a charcuterie board. Here you get to pick the cheeses and meats rather than the chef. The service here is fantastic though so I'm sure if you asked the waitress or chefs would be more than happy to choose for you. I also got the drink Between You & Me which was a light, fruity concoction.    For our meal we opted for the black mussels and the fried chicken to share. The mussels were in this broth that was delicious. I almost wish it came with a pasta because all that goodness would have soaked into the carbs and made a delicious entree. They do give you bread to eat with the sauce but to me it just wasn't enough. The fried chicken was very crispy AND seasoned which are the two most important thing for me. The second most important was the fact that the server split the serving into two plates without being asked and still gave each of us a full serving of the sides. It's a small gesture that probably cost them nothing but it's the principal that matters.   Service here is 5/5 and so is the food and atmosphere. I'm diggin' it and hope to be able to return!",

Our server was almost over instantly and went over the Happy Hour options and got us started with some drinks. We were practically starving from our day of shopping so we ordered a bunch of things!  For apps, we got the nachos, pretzel rolls, and pirogies and for the main meal we split half of the BBQ burger and a kale salad.   The appetizers were AMAZING! Particularly the pretzel rolls that came with this cheese fondue. The burger itself was pretty good and very filling.  Their drink offerings are expansive and they have a solid beer list as well as cocktails! Would definitely come here if you're in the area or visiting from out of town.",

This has become their new favorite place and I would definitely describe them as \"foodies\".  They arrived before I did and had a chance to partake in Happy Hour.  Man, am I jealous about that!  They ordered the cheese board, a side of toasted bread, the meatloaf sandwich, the chopped salad of the day (which was a very delicious kale salad that had pine nuts, asparagus, tomatoes, cabbage, avocado and a yummy lemon dressing) and made their own cheese board (What can I say, they love cheese boards!).  I had a chance to sample everything they got plus I ordered the pork belly nachos.  My favorites were between the chopped salad and the meatloaf sandwich.  The funny thing is that I'm not even a big fan of meatloaf!  I loved the chopped salad so much that I ordered an additional one to go so I could enjoy it for lunch the next day.  Tips and Tricks: If you're not familiar with this location in Scottsdale, there is a free underground parking garage that is literally right next to the restaurant.  I had no problem finding a spot.  Happy Hour is from 3pm-6pm.  If you're unsure of trying a new place, take advantage of the savings during HH.  They have their HH menu on the website.  I definitely will be coming back here again!",

CHARCUTERIE (varies) - We got the capicola ($5), salami Toscana ($5), manchego ($4), and crescenza ($4). I loved the truffle flavor from the crescenza and all the meats went along great with the cheeses. It was also a lot more filling than it looked. 4/5  BLACK MUSSELS ($13) - The mussels were a little smaller but the soup more than made up for it. It was so good to drink and it was great to soak the grilled bread in it to get all that flavor. 4/5  FRIED CHICKEN ($17) - This was probably one of the best fried chickens I've ever had. It was crispy and tender and had a bit of sweetness from the honey. We were splitting the fried chicken and we still got a full order each of the mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and biscuit. Definitely would recommend. 5/5",

They do have a kids menu but it's not a hard copy... just ask your server and they'll be able to tell you all the items ranging from a hamburger cheeseburger grilled cheese and I believe two other items.  We had a party of 12 and they were very accommodating as I made the reservation online the night before.  The food was great, somebody had the ribs and we decided to share with others. I had the Korean style ribeye cap (pricey but good) over a bed of vegetables along with the deviled eggs (always on point) and we also got a few salads with fish.  The staff always works as a team so if you need something you can ask any of the servers with ease (if you can figure out who is actually a server as they are dressed in casual clothing).  Not as vibrant as the Tempe location as they don't have an entertainment area (ping pong, corn-hole, foosball) but it's really all about the social aspect and getting together with friends.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch because the patio looked inviting. We waited 25 minutes to be seated which was fine. We had the ciabatta bread with oil and balsamic as an appetizer. It was pretty good. I had the \"Yesterday's Soup\" which was French Onion and my husband ordered a burger, cooked to medium and fries. First our waiter came and said our meal would soon be out. A large table next to us that came after us received their food including burgers. Then another waiter stopped and said our waiter said to tell us our food would be out soon. By now it seemed that maybe our order had gotten lost. At least we ate our ciabatta so we were willing to be patient. Our food finally came out, all was good until my husband got into his burger a ways and realized it was basically raw in the middle. We called the attention of our waiter and he took it back. You know how that goes. I was done with my soup  when they brought a whole new burger out. My husband said it was good but what really disappointed us is that when the waiter brought our bill there was no apology and no offer of free dessert or compensation for the screw up.  Maybe if we hadn't been so nice and patient they would of been more accommodating.  First and last time we go there. (The real kicker is that in their drink menu they boast about how much they love you, haha)",

Been coming here for over two years and the food is awesome...the turkey and slaw on a pretzel roll is what I order the most, had the ribs yesterday and they were amazing.  I will have to say their cocktail list is one of the best I've seen, and the \"After School Special\" is the reason I come back so often.  The other cocktails look awesome, but after one or two of the After School Special, I am in the best mood ever so I usually don't change it up.  The service has always been great, but after meeting one of the lady managers and their recently promoted, extremely personable barback...their service has only gotten better and I'll be back soon!",

    "text": "I had dinner Friday at Culinary Dropout. It took over the spot where the ill-fated Pink Taco used to be (next door to Wildfish). It's a great location with exposure to the mall crowd at Fashion Square and around the corner from South Bridge. This is another Fox Restaurant Concepts eatery (I'm a fan of most of their places), so I've been wanting to check this place out since it opened a few months ago.  Culinary Dropout was pretty busy the Friday night we were there. The bar area is a fair size and it was packed two people deep around it. The restaurant itself kind of sprawls out. It has fairly high ceilings and they mounted several flat panel TV's up high, so they can be seen from just about anywhere, but they do not detract from the overall atmosphere. I kind of liked being able to look up and catch the score of the game whenever I wanted to. The seating is a serious hodgepodge of furniture. Round tables, square tables, bench seats, wing chairs, and low backed lounge chairs with various fabric patterns make up the decor. This may sound bad, but it actually works (and the seats are very comfy, too). The place is fairly dim, but not like a cave. Noise levels were elevated, but we were able to carry on a conversation without any issues.  You can tell Culinary Droout wants to be more of a bar just by looking at the beer list vs. the wine list. The number of beers is twice as many as the wine, which is not a bad thing if that is what you're in the mood for. They have beers from all over the world and in any style you could want. The wine list is fairly small, with maybe 30 or so wines, but the selection is decent. Everything is available by the glass or the bottle and prices seem to be pretty much 2x retail. We had a bottle of Kinton Syrah that was $35. It's a fine example of a California Central Coast Rhone varietal: dark, rich, fruity, and just delicious.  The menu is a nice assortment of both small plates and entrees. You can mix and match your own antipasti as well. Prices range from about $12 and under for the appetizers and all the entrees are pretty much less than $20. There were so many good things to choose from that we ended up picking several different things from all over the menu. Here's a breakdown of what we ordered:      * Chilled Oysters - These were perfect, medium sized oysters from the Pacific Northwest (I asked what type they were and forgot, but they were similar to Hog Island oysters). All I know is they were exactly as I like them to be. Creamy texture and very silky. Just a squeeze of lemon and dash of hot sauce was all they needed to be a perfect starter dish for the meal.     * Artichoke Salad - This was actually a mix of artichokes, chopped asparagus, endive, and shaved parmesan. Let me just say that the salad is awesome. It was so good that my date would've probably dumped me for it...     * Butternut Squash Cannelloni - We were debating on having room for this dish, but it sounded so good we had to try it and was very worth it. I'm sometimes not a fan of this type of pasta because there's too much filling, but this one was done very well. The pasta pieces were a smaller size and the butternut squash filling was just the right amount. The sauce was not overly rich and overall it was a very enjoyable dish.     * Bistro Steak -This is a thin cut sirloin with a creamy peppercorn sauce that has just the right amount of spice to it without being overpowering. It is served with a side of french fries that are very tasty. The steak itself was cooked nicely and it's a satisfying large plate entree.  Final Take  I wasn't sure what to expect from this restaurant, but left knowing I'd be back. The food was great and the service staff was very nice. The manager was also making rounds a swell. We share all our food and the kitchen split all of our courses onto two plates for us (that's always a nice and welcome touch). People coming here looking for high end bar food will not be disappointed. If you're expecting something special, well you'll need to look elsewhere as Dropout is geared more towards being a restaurant-sized bar that serves up good grub. And for most people on a Friday night, that's just what the doctor ordered...  Overall Grade = B+ (Very Good)  The EV Foodie",

We started off our day at Olive & Ivy... then Modern Steak... and somehow ended up where Pink Taco used to be. I have been to the Vegas Pink Taco at the Hard Rock, but never the one here in Scottsdale. So I have no idea what this place was like before, but I have to say I immediately thought the the interior decor with the gothic yet modern design w/ the elaborate chandeliers was really cool. I love the large open window / doors open to fun inviting patio.  There was a live band playing... pretty sure It was the same band playing at Olive & Ivy earlier. We did not eat... just had amazing Greyhounds... fresh squeezed grapefruit w/ Kettle.... very refreshing. The food menu looked good, but smelling and seeing the entrees of those around us was  tempting. But we were focused on no more added unwanted calories unless it consisted of alcohol. We were suppose to go home and get ready to head out again on Sat night... but it was difficult to stop having fun... so it was like being in Vegas w/ my friends...minus the gambling and Pink Taco:)",

Aside from the hostess that I fell in love with and still see in my dreams (the girl with the something tattoo), the food, service, and ambiance were out of my wettest dreams.  The music went from \"straight outta compton\" to foo fighters to muddy waters, and I loved it.    We had a group of about 8 and over half of the people there weren't foodie-ish like my friend and me.  By the end of the night everyone had found a new or unknown love of food.  We ended up going through about 90% of the menu, ordering all their meats and cheeses, each entree, a few appetizers and finished with too much alcohol, almost to the point that it blurred out how good the food was.  Have been back on numerous occasions since that first night and this is one of TWO restaurants where I'm ok with going in and telling the waiter to \"order whatever you think is good\" and never look at the menu.  Seriously, that's how I order there.   Three years later of ordering this way and I haven't had a moment of regret yet, except that I'm not able to eat more.",

Sure enough 5 minutes later I see my to go bag in the window yet it is being completely ignored by the staff. I assume it must not be complete, but it was two of the same item and sides so I didn't expect to wait much longer. After twenty minutes of frustrated waiting and zero attention from the staff I finally say something. I quickly grab my to go, which is completed, and head out as I am in a hurry. I find out soon enough that not only is my meal lacking quality (it is cold and much smaller than the usual portion) but it is missing my sides I explicitly requested. I return to the restaurant upset, and the bartender who took my order tells me to fix my attitude and calls me a \"stupid piece of sh*t.\" I am appalled at this establishments service and organization and certainly will be telling all of my family and friends to avoid this place at all costs.",

    "text": "I wondered around the area of Scottsdale near my hotel (The FireSky Resort) and saw this place. The name intrigued me and a search on my mobile device's Yelp app revealed that the place had 4 1/2 stars. Dinner decision made! I walked in and was seated promptly into a pretty comfy leather bench/sofa facing the bar and tvs. I looked at the menu and was pointed to the menus indication of their specialties (indicated with two red stars). I felt adventurous and ordered the fried chicken. Great choice! (If I do say so myself) It was cooked nicely and was paired with coleslaw and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as with a roll/biscuit (that tasted like honey was baked in it). It was like a meal from KFC but way classier and tastier!",

This place offers causal cool dining with lovely decor and the most unbelievably comfortable dining chairs on earth. The food did not disappoint. The burger and fries I had were made to perfection. I tried a drink called the After School Special - if you enjoy tequila and beer, plus some added tastes to sooth your pallet, then this is your drink of choice. Meet a friend, enjoy the music and savor the expertly prepared food and drink selections. Definitely a place I plan to visit when I return.",

The pretzels with cheese fondue is delicious and huge, we couldn't finish it and we were too full to order dinner- great app for 4 people to share. They have great little snacks that are cheap so you can try a little of everything and not worry about how much you're ordering.

    "text": "When I lived in Scottsdale, this was one of my favorite places to bring out-of-towners. For those of you who are familiar with FRC's this one will not disappoint. For those of you who don't know what FRC's are look it up, and then come here.   The only way to start is with the Pretzels with Provolone Fondue. If you come a second time or have several people the house potato chips are very good as well, but don't fill up on appetizers. Also, if they have a good \"Yesterday's Soup\" namely the tortilla, I highly recommend.   I've had just about every entree and a couple of the salads, or at least tried. The Bistro Steak is a pretty good steak, but if you are looking for a good steak, head over to Modern Steak across the street instead. The two best entrees in my opinion are the 36-hour pork ribs, and the Fried Chicken.   The ribs are so tender they literally fall off the bone if you try to pick them up so don't worry about them being messy, best if you use a fork. The fried chicken is somewhat of a mystery to me. I'm not sure how they do it, and I can't even put my finger on what exactly is different about this fried chicken than other contenders, but this is by far the best I've ever had.   If you don't mind low-end beers, they have the \"Paperbag Special\" for less than $2, which is a bunch of assorted shitty beers. I always liked it to save money and create mystery.   They have a book of cocktails with really cool names. I've never been one to order cocktails at restaurants because I ALWAYS feel like they are a waste of money, but if you're into that kinda stuff they have some seemingly pretty solid ones here.",

To start the music was so damn loud I felt like I was at a club.  I couldn't hear the people at my own table. Next, we ordered a couple apps...nothing special there. I actually have to say that the mediocre apps were the best part of the meal. For my entree, I ordered the \"sweet\" corn cannelini. The corn and tomatoes that were in my dish were rancid and spoiled. Apparently the kitchen staff doesn't know how to properly rotate their product. It had such a sour taste. So I left it and proceeded to eat the pasta. I made it past 3 and had to stop because they apparently dumped a whole gallon of kosher salt on it. This dish should be called \"spoiled, rancid and salty\" corn cannelini. It was disgusting. My husband ordered the fried chicken. This was not even made to order. This was most likely done before service and kept under a heat lamp or a hotbox for the remainder of the service. Awful food. I will never go back.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try Culinary Dropout for a good while, last night the opportunity finally struck and I was not let down. Kristen and I went with our three favorite couples to celebrate an engagement, we decided to arrive at six thirty because they do not take reservations (I will never understand why restaurants choose to not accept them). Once seventy five percent of your party is there you get a little buzzer and your name on the list.        We found our friends sitting at the outside bar and joined them for some drinks. The bar is pretty awesome, there were several bartenders, so you never needed more than a little eye contact for quick service, and they have a ton of beers and specialty cocktails on the menu, from fruity and sweet to harsh and alocoholy. The seats were fairly plentiful and comfy, and there are also lounge seats all around the bar area for the outside dining, I thought the layout and design was attractive and used the limited space wisely, I'd love to come back for an outside lunch. The bartenders and waiters were friendly and attentive, all good looking (of course, Scottsdale) and all of our drinks (from beers to martinis to fruity stuff) were delicious and not too overpriced, I mean, they were overpriced, but not quite Scottsdale overpriced. So far, so good. We paid the tab and headed inside.        The atmosphere inside is awesome. I hope to someday open a restaurant, so when I enter a new business I eat it up, I devour the place, I pick apart the ambiance, the lighting, the noise level, the architecture and design, everything, and I really like Culinary Dropout. The tables are huge, slabs of hard, rough wood, very rustic and western, it is dimly lit with modern (not too loud) music playing, there is a surprising amount of room and lots of space for big party's, they have a stage for live music (awesome), Culinary Dropout really surprised me.        I will spare critiquing each meal and just stick with Kristen and I's, but just to be fair, two in our group had the beer battered fish and chips, one had the pub burger, one had the fried chicken and two had the shaved prime rib dip, and none complained.        Our group shared both the house potato chips, which were very tasty and fried just right, and the onion dip was flavorful, not some run of the mill dip, and the soft pretzel and provolone fondue, which was fantastic. A pretzel is kind of a pretzel, they were good, soft and all, but the provolone sauce simply exploded, man it was good, creamy and tasty, you should definitely try it. I ordered the fried chicken, which was delectable, it had a great but not overdone crunch, it was sweet and you could actually taste the spices, not just the taste of the fryer, you also get a lot of it, three big, juicy, tender pieces. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which was good enough, nothing special, but only had two bites in it, and two very small but scrumptious biscuits with honey. Dear Kristen had the shaved prime rib dip which was fine, a little disappointing I guess, just not much meat, the meat to bread ratio was severely lacking, and it came with fries which were very good. If you're really in the mood for a prime rib sandwich, head to Houston's.        I will be back here for sure. I paid for Kristen and I, plus the newly engaged couple, and including drinks and all food it only came to ninety eight dollars, that is a bargain for this atmosphere and the overall quality of the food and staff. It also only took us about an hour to get seated, eight people on a Friday night in Scottsdale with no reservations? How can you beat that. Culinary Dropout is simply awesome.",

    "text": "This is another entry from the Fox Restaurant Concepts folks. Typically, I find their restaurants to be a bit over-priced, over-hyped and uninspired. The prices here are better, for sure, but the menu is still....eh....blah. I sat and stared at it for an hour before we headed over and I truthfully wasn't that interested in eating anything on the menu. It's not that creative and healthy is a bit lacking. However, that being said, the staff is wonderful, and what they do have the menu, they do well.  I wish their happy hour went until 7 but that's alright, the wine and beer list is extensive and the prices are fair. I don't know that I would pay what they were asking for their cocktails, though. My husband had the chicken hash which was exactly as described and was a pretty good, authentic hash. I would love if they used Yukon golds or red potatoes instead of russets since russets tend to get a little mealy but the flavors were good. I had the artichoke salad and had grilled chicken added to it no problem. This was very good, very light and very large! I got a dinner, a snack and a lunch out of this. The veggies are very, very thinly sliced so you get very subtle hints of the endive and the asparagus as well as the artichokes and the dressing is a nice, light, vinegar and oil (I'm thinking cider vinegar based on a subtle sweetness). We did have the soft prezel appetizer which was good. I would prefer them to change their presentation on this one, though. The fondue put is far too large for the amount of cheese they give you (the amount of cheese is fine) but it looks silly reaching down to the bottom of the oversized pot. The melted provolone had a lovely texture, was not lumpy or thick and was a perfect compliment to the sea-salted pretzel bites. We split it amongst three and didn't finish it all.   Overall, ambiance is good, staff is friendly, service is quick and the food is decent. I just wish the menu had a little more oomph or something that made you go \"Oh! I HAVE to try that!!\" I wouldn't come back here on my own but if a friend suggested it again as happened last night, I wouldn't say no.",

    "text": "Hit and miss at best.  I was excited to try Culinary Dropout because I've never had a bad experience with a Fox restaurant, but this one came up a bit short.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting, perhaps places like North and The Green House have set the bar a little too high.   First of all, the service wasn't great.  Our server was inattentive, and we spent most of the night getting drink refills and new silverware from another server, who was friendly and happy to help. Tried an assortment of food off the menu.  The anitpasti was excellent; I loved the selection of meats and cheeses and our ability to mix and match.  Next we had oysters on the half shell.  They were fantastic! After that we tried the gnocchi with Italian sausage.  They shouldn't call it gnocchi, it was more like mashed potatoes.  The whole dish was a bland, mushy mess.  The one saving grace of the dish were the large pieces of Italian sausage.  Finally we tried the cuban sandwich, which tasted good, but was nothing spectacular.   I'll be back at Culinary Dropout, if only for drinks and apps.  Any place with Moose Drool on tap is pretty good in my book.",

He then responded by saying \"beer\" rudely tossing a menu In front of me. I waited for him to return, ordered my beer and he turned around with no response or acknowledgment of my order and returned a few minutes later with my beer. He then stood there staring a me until I asked him how much I owed him. He then responded with \" over 5 and under 10.\" I immediately responded by asking if he was serious and he told me he would print me out a receipt so I could \"figure it out\". I then walked away after paying and waited to be seated with my girlfriend while the bartender (Casey) proceeded to stand at the bar smiling in a condescending manner and speaking with co workers about our unpleasant exchange.  I would recommend avoiding the bartenders unless you enjoy being treated like absolute crap by the unkept bartender that literally looked as if he had just woke up, skipped a shower and had not groomed himself properly In weeks. Other than that the band was good, our server was cool, and the food was decent. Overall. Not stoked. I would hve rather hit up the food court inside the mall for some Panda Express!",

    "text": "I came here with some fellow out-of-towner Yelpers after reading the buzz here on Yelp and the restaurant's website. Let's just say that it wasn't at all what I expected.  The website proclaims: \"... Culinary Dropout is going to be a really fun, cool and casual chef-driven gastropub.\"  Gastropub? I think not. Try gastroclub (TM).  Instead of a casual, low-key bar that also serves great food, CD is more like a club where the music is more important than the food. Certainly the blaring music dampened any culinary excitement I had when we walked in the door. We could barely hear the hostess as she told us it would be an hour wait. We put our names down anyway, saw that the bar was packed, and then escaped outside to wait.  Eventually we grabbed seats at the outside bar, where two other patrons had just polished off two platters of oysters. No fewer than three servers came to ring up bills and chat while we sat right there in front of them with the platters and dirty silverware piled up, but nobody bothered to greet us or clear the plates until about 10 minutes later. By the time the bartender was ready to take our order, we got called for our table and re-entered the restaurant.  We were seated at a four-top just in front of the stage, where a musician started playing a short time later. Not surprisingly, we had a hard time carrying on our conversations. Instead we buried our heads in the menu, which offered a promising variety of eclectic dishes. Our table went with the onion soup, artichoke salad, fried chicken, butternut squash cannelloni, and kurobuta pork ribs.   I'll admit the food was good. The artichoke salad was refreshing: crisp shavings of artichoke hearts, asparagus, and endive mixed with some frisee and a slightly sweet vinaigrette. My fried chicken was excellent. Although I initially thought it looked burnt, due to its mahogany color, the meat was succulent. The coating was just a touch spicy with a hint of cayenne, nicely crisp, and also drizzled with some honey. Everybody else enjoyed their food as well. It was the service that continued to be a problem.   Our waitress, although attentive at first, disappeared after she took our orders. Other servers brought our food to us, which was probably the reason that we received only one order of salad, split. We'd wanted one order to be split between two of us, and another order for the person who was only having soup and salad. When only two bowls of salad were delivered, two of us shared one of them. Later, while we were eating our entrees, yet another server tried to drop off another bowl of salad, but we waved it off thinking it wasn't ours. Suspiciously, however, this bowl was twice as big as the others we'd received. We flagged our waitress over to ask for water and silverware and explained what happened. She promised we'd only be charged for one salad. Yet, when the bill came, we were charged for two. Again, we had to explain that we'd only received the split order--and finally the lightbulb went on, or flickered. After consulting the kitchen to confirm what happened, she redid our bill and apologized.  Would I eat here again? No, not unless it was for lunch because I can't imagine it would be as painfully loud then. The food was good and the service issues can be worked out, but the concept seems confused. Even though the dimly-lit decor featured chairs you might find in a pub and leather banquettes, the overall vibe was far from pub-like. If you're okay with a noisy gastroclub instead of an intimate gastropub, go ahead and come here because the food seems worth it.",

The wait staff doesn't wear uniforms and is extremely knowledgable and helpful. Our waitress steered us toward the soft pretzel fondue as an appetizer and we were very glad she did. Warm salty pretzels and a cheese fondue = heaven! The chopped salad was yummy - but a little less dressing would have been nice. The flavors of the salad got a teeny bit drowned in it. But still a good one.  The only drawback is that this is a very noisy space - especially when there is live music, as there was on our recent Saturday night visit. The band was wonderful, don't get me wrong, but we couldn't hear each other due to the music, the large table and the general acoustics of the room. No biggie for us that night, but if you want to catch up with old friends, head to the patio so you can hear each other. The wine list was nice - smaller side, but what was there was good!",

I told the hostess yes, my birthday.  When we arrived on time for dinner last night, there were at least 8 large, comfortable, empty tables with big, inviting, upholstered chairs in the restaurant that would have accommodated us.  However, we were shown to a table for 4 barely inside the front door.  There were only 4 seats at the table, so they brought in a cold wicker chair from outside for me to sit on.  We were then told that the other half of the restaurant had been \"bought out\" which was why we were seated in such a ridiculous way...they sure knew how to make me feel special for my birthday!  In addition, even though they had asked me what we were celebrating, not one time during the entire night did any employee acknowledge my birthday in any way.  I could really care less, since I don't need restaurant employees to make a fuss over my birthday to make it special, but why ask if you're just going to forget it altogether?    The food and drinks were excellent, as usual, and the prices are very fair, however the seating arrangement really irritated me, and our service was sub-par.  Our server was assigned to the large party once they finally arrived and pretty much forgot we were there.  Once she dropped our check off at the table, we waited over 15 minutes for her to come pick up the credit card.  Finally I got tired of waiting and walked it over to her.  She was completely non-apologetic and much more concerned with chatting with her co-worker.    I typically enjoy this restaurant, but really wish I had chosen somewhere else for my birthday celebration this year.  I don't enjoy being treated like a second class citizen.",

Got to the table and it was clear  to me that the evening previous was busy.  Other tables were set ours was not And never was. In a corner booth on the patio. A piece of tomato was on the back of my giant chair as well as crumbs on the bankette. Our waitress was friendly and full of energy. And I  know this is petty but  her clothes were very dirty. As if she had worked in them the night before or had just milked a cow.  As our table was not set I needed to ask for sugar for tea. When the caddie arrived all the packets had been wet and dried so the sugar would not come out and stuck to the paper receptacle. Which I thought was funny.  It is not.  I heard this waitress apologize at least 6 times while I there. To me and to the nearest table.  After two courses I had to get up to find salt and pepper.  I should have just looked in my tea because the pepper seemed or at least some of it was floating in it. And of  the 4 people who came to ask how everything was in an hour none of this noticed.  All in all the food was fine. What I would expect from a Fox Restaurant and a little  bit better really but even a Culinary Drop Out would not serve a whole yellowish tomato with a mussel. Please work with your FOH staff. Or at the very least have a manager who cares. I",

Not 10 minutes later a friend walked by who I hadn't seen in a while.  He mentioned that he had a heart attack just two weeks ago as we both looked at my burger and fries.  He was drooling with envy because he can't eat this stuff anymore and I was thinking that I should probably start to cut back on this type of meal.  The burger was good though.

My #1 piece of advice: TRY THE FONDUE PRETZEL BITES. They are incredible. The fondue comes in a little kettle kept warm by a lit candle on the base of the vessel. The presentation for all the food and drinks was great. For my main meal I had the pork ribs, which were fantastic. I've also heard nothing but great things about the meatloaf as well! There are of course many many spirits to choose from as well. To top everything off the wait staff was incredibly friendly and a joy to be served by. The vision for the restaurant is clearly displayed and proven to the customer. The next time I'm in Scottsdale I'll be sure to return here.",

He personally spoke with the manager Hailey and holding a perfectly coherent conversation about how he hasn't had a drink in over a week and would like to just enjoy his night. Explaining he didn't get a minute of sleep she was so quick to cut him off when he was speaking and completely deny any chance of him getting a drink. With over 15 years of experience in the service industry i have yet to even have seen anybody be cutoff even before beginning.

The hostess and our servers were super nice, friendly, and knowledgeable.  A bacon-infused Bloody Mary made its way to my place setting, and  my oh my, it was delish! Just what the doctor ordered!  We noshed on those pretzels and fondue, along with plates of oysters (which I can't review since I'm allergic. Dammit.).  I had the fish and chips, which were fresh, crunchy and properly served with vinegar and slaw.  Others had salads, burgers, chicken fried steaks...everybody raved about their dishes, and everything looked great.  Service was perfect and a great time was had by all.",

I ordered the pretzel and fondue I've heard a ton about and it was good; but not as good as I was expecting it to be after hearing all the compliments about it. I also had the fried chicken (which our server said was one of their best selling entrees), and it was also good, but I've been spoiled with excellent homemade fried chicken (that tops this one easily). The buttermilk biscuit was a bit too salty for my taste. My sister had the ribs- which were very meaty- but the sauce was lacking- it said jalapeno and molasses in the sauce-and all we really tasted was ketchup. I had the acai mojito which was tasty.   The restaurant and patio are beautiful, the whole area is. Also if you're one that doesn't like louder restaurants-I'd say to sit outside-inside was too loud-I couldn't hear my tablemates too well. Our server was good and paid us the perfect amount of attention- props to her and her service! Overall I'd say Culinary Dropout was good- but not somewhere I'd probably come again if I was just in Phoenix for the day.",

    "text": "Came here for a late night dinner with a visiting friend. It's definitely one of those trendy, modern restaurants you want to take your time eating at. The interior was adorned with cute couches and booths, good for a date or a girls night out!  First off, FREE PARKING garage near the valet booth!!! score!!  we decided to order two dishes and an appetizer to share. Little did we know the provolone fondue (our appetizer) came in hugeee portion, getting us full before our main dishes came out haha But of course, this didnt stop us for digging in.   The kitchen was nice enough to split the meals on two plates before bringing it out. We got the fried chicken and biscuit as well as the turkey pastrami sandwich (pretzel bun! more pretzel!).  The fried chicken was really tender and juicy inside and out. Every bite pulled us in for another, despite the fact our stomachs were bulging out over our pants (exaggeration). Biscuit was a bit salty but eating it the next day as left over, the taste was just right.   The sandwich was soo juicy. The combination of turkey, pastrami and pretzel just makes it a complete dish. I loved that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of meat. Tried dipping the entire sandwich in the provolone fondue...best decision of the night.  Im excited for another chance to go.Love to try their happy hour and have a taste of their live music!",

When I first heard of the name, I thought, wow, people who dropout of the culinary school must all go there.  I was totally kidding with that remark.  My date and I ordered Chips & Dip, it was homemade chips, not too salty and not too oily, which was great because I didn't want my fingers to be all greasy and sticky; We also had Korean Chicken & Shrimp on sticks, it doesn't have the flavor of being a Korean food and it tasted blend; Their HH food and drink items are just $3, it's totally worth the buck.  And the beer came in a small cute glass, it will definitely fill you up.  Our server was Benjamin, he's service was excellent.  If you aren't sure what to order, make sure you ask him as he'll tell you what's good and what's not so good.  Try it out the next time you are in Old Town Scottsdale.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were in the area and planning on trying something new and found this place. The Atmosphere was very hip and vibe, and we were seated really fast and was offered drinks the moment we sat down. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we received our drinks and began to order our Antipasti. Everything was going fine with the fine cheeses until we received our cornbread, which was flavorless even with butter and whatever the powdery cheese was that also had no flavor. It took yet another 10 minutes for the server to come to check on us, and another 10 minutes for us to order. My girlfriend ordered the Turkey Pastrami with fries, and I ordered the 36-hour smoked pork ribs with fries and coleslaw.   Here is where everything started to go wrong, it took a while again to receive the food and be offered drinks again, or even had our water topped off.   Our food was...TERRIBLE. The Ribs and sandwich came out lukewarm and cold, and our fries were soggy and cold. Our server was nice enough to send it back, and have it come out hot. Let me say this, we spent $75 for a meal, so we expect FRESH food ESPECIALLY for BBQ ribs (36 hours smoked at that) and turkey pastrami which is always served as HOT sandwich. We got our food back another 5 minutes later which we were extremely disappointed as the food was incredibly salty, almost inedible, and the food was dried out from microwaving. That is not okay, what restaurant charges 3/4's of a $100 for food that is not fresh, incredibly salty, and microwaved. We were tired out after a long day and with 2 hours of service that should have taken no longer than 45 minutes-hour, we come to the conclusion that we will not be returning. This was just awful.  Tip (for the cooks): If you advertise ribs that have cooked for 36 hours, a customer such as myself expects the meat to fall off the bone, and be real juicy. Not a microwaved saltpile. That goes for the Turkey Pastrami.   We give this place 2 stars solely cause the bartenders were magical with their drinks and the server was very polite and easy to talk to.",

The best experience I ever had was when I went here on a date night with my boyfriend and they had a live band playing and it was pretty noisy, but a very fun, exciting environment. The other handful of times I've been here it's just been OK. There are only a few things on the menu that appeal to me (one being the pretzel bites and the fish and chips being another), but otherwise nothing too exciting for the price that you pay. I'm currently here now, at a table of 8 for a good friend's \"goodbye dinner\" before he leaves to go out of state, and it's taken us 2 hours to finish dinner because our server decided to disappear since we were supposed to have a much larger party. This was supposed to be special and fun, and it's been the furthest thing from it because of the service. They stopped serving, bussing, and caring about our experience and made it abundantly clear. When you're paying money to eat at a restaurant you shouldn't ever feel like you're annoying your server, let alone the rest of the staff. Very disappointing.",

Once we got seated I didn't meet the waiter for an entire quarter of a football game. Too be fair it was about 65% capacity so I guess that means they were too busy to remember water for my wife and I. Then came the food which is just an average Applebee's level dining. And don't bother telling them you have an allergy to something cause they certainly didn't give A crap.",

While reading the menu, a bird landed on the chandelier and promptly deficated on to the menu and silverware of a member of our party. We waited 10 minutes before the waiter returned at which time we explained the distasteful situation and demanded to be reseated. The waiters response was \"oh OK I told the hostess not to seat anyone at this table because of the bird sh##\" We were reseated at a table inside and then the waiter disappeared.  20 minutes later, I asked the passing hostess to have our waiter take our order. The hostess disregarded our request and we waited an additional 15 minutes before the waiter took our order. Clearly we were being punished for having the audacity to demand the \"privilege\" of dining in a clean and sanitary area free of the threat of being dumped on by birds.

We walked in and 4 employees hung around the hostess desk chit chatting, and when we asked to be seated they told us they didn't open for another 30 minutes. Their attitude was kind of snotty, so we (gladly) left and walked over to our second choice, Culinary Dropout.  Again, we were early, but what a different experience. The host greeted us with a huge, welcoming smile and we were immediately seated, despite arriving before the actual opening time. The kitchen was ready, and our waitress, Britney, was absolutely lovely. We ordered antipasti: a gorgeous smoky cheese, with some prosciutto and grissini, and bread with olive oil. Fabulous! Then, the homemade chips and dip were brought. Perfect! We split a salad (that had pickled sour apples, which, let me tell you, were the stars of the dish). Excellent.  But nothing ... and i mean NOTHING ... could top dessert. Salted Caramel Custard.  I still dream about it. Between the gorgeous decor, exceptional service and yummy food, Culinary Dropout is definitely a new favorite lunch spot.",

Driving past it, I thought it was a cooking school for hipsters but once I found out it was actually a restaurant I was intrigued.   I had a taste of the soft pretzel & provolone fondue which was awesome, and then for my entree I had the Short Rib Pasta which I wished would never end.   Seriously, I ate slowly so it felt like it lasted longer.    The only star I'm subtracting is for the over-the-top douchy ambiance, it's definitely tailored for a \"certain crowd\", which is a shame because the food was so good.   I would feel awkward bringing my parents to this restaurant.  Its almost like they are trying too hard to try too hard.    Seacrest out.",

It's located near the Scottsdale Waterfront, and the downside of the location is the parking. We ended up parking at the parking garage that is located across from Olive and Ivy. It was free, and only a short walk.   We had a bit of a wait, and Friday nights tend to have louder and busier, for it was a nice place to start out for the evening.",

The pairing experience lasted about 2 hours and you are seating with other diners at a table that seats 16 people so you have an opportunity to really interact with the other diners which for us made the experience more fun.  If you are not a social butterfly this type of dining experience may not be for you. During the pairing the beer representative made his rounds explaining what we were drinking and the history behind the beer and how it is made.  The chef also made his rounds after each course was served to give us the ingredients and techniques used.  Overall a great experience, plenty of service and we didn't have to do anything.  The only things that could have been a little different was the lighting was very dim so reading about our experience or reviewing the catalogs that were on the table was difficult and it was at times difficult to hear what was being said over the restaurant and other patron noise.",

    "text": "This is a GREAT gastropub with an atmosphere that sets up a fun night out. I wanted to try something from the local brewery, so I got an Epicenter Ale made by the SanTan Brewing Company. Off the tap, the beer had a nutty flavor, a little malty, and not very bitter. It was okay.  The bartender also gave me a slice of bacon when requested for my friend to nibble on during the long wait.  Ah yes, the long wait. We were told 15-30, and actually hit an hour. It was Spring Training, so I understand the wait time, but just tell us an hour! They made up for it by giving us free pretzel balls and fondue and a side of roasted beets. If eating cheese didn't make my stomach hate me, I'd probably just order a bowl of that fondue and eat it with a spoon.   I split the Roasted Chicken Salad which came with apples, pistachios and gorgonzola on mixed greens with a light dressing. Very good. And such a generous portion!  It was the size of almost two entree salads.  For an entree, I ordered the Butternut Squash Cannelloni, which was decadent in a buttery sauce. They could have been more generous with the mushrooms and brussels sprouts, but I will admit that the cannelloni was plentiful.  If I were to ever go to Spring Training again, I would definitely hit up Culinary Dropout again.",

I had the meatloaf, something I'd never usually order out but I tried it.  It was very good, especially with the mashed potatoes and gravy.  Nice comfort food.  We also had that Spanish thin sliced smoked pork for the table which was great.  I got to try a piece of fried chicken.  While it was no Lolo's, it was damn good.  I'd order it next time.",

Curry is normally served w/ rice, but thought it was odd that I didn't get rice with it.  Atmosphere is nice especially having a girl's night out or just hanging out w/ a group of people.

I had the gorgonzola chicken salad which was delicious, my friend had the crispy shrimp caesar salad but had them blacken the shrimp instead of fry it, my 20 y/o nephew had the grilled chicken club sandwich which was piled high with meat ! Non rushed atmosphere the front doors were open so nice breeze. Heard it could get loud and hard to hear conversations, probably related to high ceilings and wooden floors, but we didn't find it loud tonight. There were some empty tables inside so not extremely busy. Enjoyed the evening and will return again !!",

Certainly go with the pretzels for an appetizer, they were soft and flavorful, the cheese was solid. Drink options were exceptional.   The wife got the Salmon entree, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I got the meatloaf, which was pretty tasty as well, although the green beans seemed a little under-seasoned and the mash was nothing to brag about.

We ordered a few selections from the meat/cheese/snack section, and for our meals, I had the Pub Burger, and my wife had the Grilled Chicken Club. Honestly, for the price, the food didn't blow me away. It certainly wasn't bad, but just seemed average, and lacked the \"wow-factor\" that we have experienced at other FRC restaurants.",

    "text": "Went here on a Tuesday night just before the dinner rush.   The young blonde hostess seated us quickly, but gave us the worst table available-right at the front door - when there were three tables within 10 feet of us that didn't have crappy metal chairs with no freaking padding.   Ok, fine - I'll ask for a padded chair. 15 minutes later and she just flat out forgot. That kid needs to be looking around and get some situational awareness. Fine, she's young, new or just having an off night.   Jaimie to the rescue - realizing that other patrons who came in AFTER us were being served while we waited to 15 minutes just to be acknowledged, she jumped right in and took care of our needs. Candidly, we about two minutes from just walking out.   As for the food: Nachos were great.   Fried chicken was mediocre. Parts of it tasted burnt and the honey was overpowering. That's just me, though, as I've heard rave reviews about it. Certainly edible, mostly satisfying, but I came in with expectations that were probably too high.   Cole slaw - superb. Dear chef, don't put the coleslaw next to the gravy soaked mashed potatoes - the two flavors don't mix well.   Atmosphere - a little loud, not overpowering, by the place has hip, young vibe without turning off older patrons, so there's a good balance.   Overall, decent meal, decent price but could be better and here are some suggestions.   Ask customers where they want to sit. Like, at which particular table.   Ditch those crummy metal chairs. They're torture devices.   You don't need four people at the front podium if three of them don't have their head on a swivel.   Kudos to Jaimie, by the way.",

    "text": "The atmosphere of this place is beautiful. I went on a day where the weather was like low 80s or high 70s, so I got to sit and dine outside. It made the experience joyful.  For atmosphere, I'd give this place a 4.5/5.  The food menu was very limited. I took a while deciding what I want to get because there were not much appetizing choices for me. There are mostly burgers, salads, sandwiches and soup. Well I guess since it is an American restaurant. There are quite a few drink choices though. For the menu, I'd give it a 3/5.  The food I got was a smoked salmon with tomatoes, bread and egg. The salmon was good, I ate it together with the tomatoes and bread. The dish may seem a bit strange to some people, but everything on the dish is served cold or cool. Somewhere between those two. It's just not served hot. For drinks, I got the strawberry mojito. I'd give the food a 4/5.",

I had the 36-hour ribs which were phenomenal... Everyone in the group seemed to enjoy their choices as well! We had the pretzel bites, deviled eggs, and perogies, all were really tasty.",

It has it all - a unique and interesting menu, with new takes on old classics, and health food and food for all persuasions of dietary restrictions, and great service.  Sat on the corner couch in the outside patio, which was the perfect place to be on a nice night.  It's actually quieter outside, and it's great for people watching and to enjoy the nighttime temperatures.   Had the kale salad and ordered it with chicken.  The sides were awesome.  Actually, you know what?  Everything was awesome.    I'm glad I tried this chain restaurant.  It was the suggestion of an Uber driver, and really hit the spot.  Can't wait to come back and try again!",

The other day my daughter had salami for the first time and told my husband, \"I want to marry 25 salamis.\" That, my friends, is how I feel about the pretzel fondue. Of course, if you aren't a pretzel lover to begin with, ignore my rant.  Also decent/interesting is the bacon Bloody Mary. I don't know if I would order another one, but I was glad to have tried it and, honestly, who doesn't like stirring their drink with a thick, delicious slice of bacon? I also ordered a meat-filled sandwich with spicy peppers. I can't remember the name of it, but I have a hard time believing there is a similar menu item. It, too, was delicious and very large. I took it back to the hotel and ate round two several hours later, before falling into a food coma.   Our server was super sweet and they had nice outdoor seating.

I had originally requested a patio table when making reservations online (after reading reviews that it could get loud inside) and I received a phone call earlier in the day that patio was first come first served. Completely understandable and call was appreciated. We were given a table towards the back inside and didn't feel the noise level was too bad. We ordered the pretzels and an antipasto plate- we were enjoying visiting with friends and didn't even notice there was a delay in the kitchen, but the manager came to the table and comped them! Wow. I wasn't impressed with the two different cocktails I ordered- one was the After School special- it had a raspberry infused tequila and served with a Modelo, like a sweet version of a Michelada. The other was the El Madador- this one was really too sweet and the other just didn't taste good. But the food more than made up for it as well as the service. The pretzels are amazing and a must order and the cheddar pork cracklings were delicious. I had the fish and chips- the batter in the fish was slightly soggy and over salted, but the coleslaw served with was excellent. The 36 hours ribs, the turkey pastrami and the fried chicken were enjoyed at our table as well. All and all, I would stick to appetizers and beer or wine on my next visit, but would come back due to service and ambience .",

The waitress was helpful and accessible while never obtrusive. Our meals all arrived at the same time. The water was refilled at half empty (or half full?). I ordered the seared tuna salad and enjoyed every bite. A few extra prices of tuna would have been nice, but for $15 I definitely got my money's worth.

It was all these gross corner pieces that basically wasted half of the salad.   The sandwich - it had almost no flavor and the bun was hard.   Seems to be all hype and no substance..",

    "text": "We stopped here as we were passing thru Scottsdale.  I had the fried chicken.  It is marked on the menu as one of their most popular items.  We started with the pretzel fondue.  The pretzel was actually big, puffy, pretzel balls.  They were good, but could have used a little more salt.  The cheese wasn't my favorite.  It seemed a little...grainy, almost like it had been too hot, and it was about ready to break.  Not a smooth fondue cheese.  The fried chicken.  Let me start by saying that it was ok.  It comes with honey drizzled on it.  Sounds great, right?  Well, I could see the honey, but there was zero flavor.  The breading had zero flavor, and the honey had zero flavor.  I was looking for that little sweet kick, and I didn't find it, so I put salt on it, and ate it that way.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good, the coleslaw was horrid and vinegary (which would have been a nice kick, if thw chicken had a sweetness to it).  The biscuit had a honey drizzle on top.  buttered inside.  It was thick like a biscuit, but, again, flavorless.    The beer list is great with a bunch of local AZ beers, but thats a drive for us just to go for beer.",

We also had banana cream pie and a couple of very yummy and strong cocktails, names are escaping me, pistol something & dove something, both were delicious and we would recommend.  Overall we would suggest you eat at Culinary Drop Out and we will come again when we travel to the area.",

My parents, my uncle, and my great aunt (89years old) were in town, I thought I'd take them somewhere new and delicious that they haven't been too before. First off the first 20minutes were fantastic....until we had a live band playing. Totally fine! What went wrong was, the level of music was incredibly too high/loud for the entire inside. My parents and myself were so upset with the 3 TIMES WE ASKED OUT WAITRESS TO LOWER THE MUSIC (she'd come back and tell us whoever or if she did that you couldn't). My father is in the military and the level of sound in your restaurant was unsafe, no one would hear an emergency (if there was one). The band should of played on the patio or lower the music for the small dining area inside. We won't be back because it was entirely too loud to hear or try to carry on a conversation with family. And how rude to do that when spring training is going on or spring break with people are visiting and obliviously eating.",

The Cheese, bread and olive oil  was a great start to a meal, but the balsamic was a little too much.  I have to say, the best deal is the happy hour antipasti!  It's a huge portion and great variety!  Sweet potato canneloni was my main meal twice and its with mushrooms, Brussels sprouts and Parmesan.  It has good flavor and is a good portion.

    "text": "Took my wife to the Culinary Dropout (CD) for our date night.  We had heard a lot about this place since it took over the spot where the Pink Taco (Mexican food yeah right) use to be.  We started out with Provolone Fondue and pretzel bread.  We also ordered some of their hard to find premium meat (Jamon Iberico).  The fondue was very mild in taste which was good but nothing that would stand out.  I did wrap the pretzel bread with the Iberico which was a good combo.  For a main course I had the ribs and my wife had the shrimp po boy.  The ribs were good but were not smoked, and they are also boiled before they are cooked.  If you like ribs that are not traditionally prepared (smoked/bbq) then you should like these because they do have great pork flavor.  The po boy was also good.  It had great flavor overall but you could not taste the shrimp in it.  The other flavors in the sandwich were just to overpowering.  I think if CD marinated the shrimp and grilled them instead of frying them it would have held up better to the other flavors.  Service was good but not exceptional.  Overall CD is a good restaurant but not special in a sea of trendy bar/restaurants.  It is the typical Fox project that has good food but nothing that would be classified as unforgettable.  Would I go back if a friend had not tried the place yet, yes but I would not go back for a second time with my wife nor would it be a place I would suggest to people as a can't miss.",

Veggies were fresh and chicken was perfectly cooked.  Our waitress was a doll.  Ok, now don't get scared-- I found a little hair in my chicken. I was totally grossed out and gave my salad back.  My sister got the same one and found nothing and it was totally fine. The waitress who was so kind and friendly brought me back a brand new salad with chicken and I finished the entire thing and it was lovely.  The ambiance was super cool and trendy we ate outside in December. They had heaters outside, which was nice.  TVs and live music, cushioned seats outside.",

Other than that, its just another restaurant with somewhat of an overpriced menu, especially for alcohol ( My chicken salad was $12, and mojito was $9).  If you can stay away from the booze, it will definitely save you some cash.  The chicken salad was average at best, as well as the service.",

The BBQ ribs were stringy and tasted like... well, the embarassing reality is that Chili's ribs blow them away. They were wet and mushy and stringy. The steak was not a ribeye steak at all as described. Instead, it was sliced into medallions and served over what was supposed to be blue cheese sauce but was more like weak runny ranch. The meat was \"watery\" and without flavor as if it had been frozen, possibly more than once! Waste of money. Good service though. We enjoyed our bottle of wine and crossed that one off the list. This is a bar, not a restaurant.",

I've ended up a lot here recently because it is right below my office and that's where everyone wants to go for drinks and sometimes for lunch. I've come here multiple times with my office for happy hour and it took like 20 minutes before someone even took our order. My biggest complaint is that you can't do happy hour on the patio...you have to be AT the bar. Seriously...what is with that?  It is perfect patio weather 9 months out of the year here and I can't get happy hour outside? This is almost a deal breaker for me due to my extreme love of happy hour ON patios. Also, the service is pretty slow. . I do like the brown bag special just because it's funny and cheap and the Ahi Tuna Salad is good but not worth 14 bucks or whatever it is. I went the other night for a birthday dinner and they had live music which was cool. Convenience is what keeps me comin back. ...And the happy hour thing...C'MON.",

We had a table of about 10 people, and it was nice to find that they took reservations and had a great table ready for us when we arrived.  I didn't have dinner (already ate) but I did enjoy the soft pretzel and fondue that everyone raves about!  I absolutely loved the idea of the \"Paper Bag Special\" beer.  It's only $1.95 and they bring you the beer of their choice in a small paper bag.  (I was lucky enough to get my favorite, a PBR!)    The reason for my 3 star is that I didn't particularly love the atmosphere or the decor of the restaurant.  Didn't really give me a fun, \"come back and dine with us again\" vibe.  It was nice for a large party, but I don't envision going there on a date or just with a co-worker or girl friend.    I did see they had a stage set up for live music, I think only takes place on the weekends, I would like to go back and see how that changes the scene.",

Needless to say, I went to the grand opening of culinary dropout....and pretzels? really? french fries as appetizers? I feel that the menu lacks creativity, very basic and bland, and the food, well lives up to its name as \"drop out\"..... With wildfish right next door and modern stake eatery right across, and a  fillaberto's always within reach in AZ, don't see a single reason to go here! Though my male friends have a particular soft spot for this place, because of the abundance of good looking female servers???

One of our guests ordered a burger which was undercooked and sent back....ok, this happens but the plate did not return to the table until we were ready for the bill! Despite \" it's on it's way\", several times, it arrived late enough that our guest could not participate in the dinner experience. Explanation, \" we were backed up in the kitchen\".

I would say that the Culinary Dropout was both interesting and had pretty good food to boot. The place has a young feel to it and the servers and bartenders could just be the most attractive (and I'm talkin' men and women here folks) collection I've ever seen working in one restaurant.   I grabbed a seat at the bar ordered a drink and decided on a Caesar Salad to start followed by Rainbow Trout for dinner. The salad came in a chilled bowl, had both romaine and kale in it and a more lemony than garlicky dressing that had a nice tart bite to it. The addition of kale was good and allowed me to text home and tell my wife I was eating a superfood for dinner to try and score some health points!   The trout came in a hurry, too much of one really, and was a large double filet with crisp skin, toasted almonds, green beans and some carmelized onions. It was moist and tasty though it was somewhat unevenly salted. The green beans on it were cooked just right and added a great crunch.   Beyond the pacing problems with the salad and entree coming out on top of each other, this was a nice meal and I would not hesitate to try it again.",

    "text": "Went to Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale one late afternoon last week with my son and daughter-in-law. We ordered 5 appetizers for 4 of us.  The truffle cheese came as a blob on a wood board without any crackers/bread to put it on.  The deviled eggs were the worst we had ever eaten.  It seems that the almonds came out of 2 different containers. The top layer was only OK and the bottom almonds were going rancid.  Trader Joe's almonds are much better and less expensive.  When presented to us, the contents of the presentation board leaked all over the table making a big mess.  We had to clean up the table ourselves with our napkins and had to ask for clean napkins, which took a while. The men at the table ordered beers.  One came out as half foam from a can of beer and not even the whole can, we returned it. Getting refills of tea was a major chore. The entrees were no better.  My husband ordered the fried chicken because it had 2 stars on the menu and we thought it would be something special.  It came to the table just short of being burnt and the meat was so dry he couldn't eat it.  It tasted like it was cooked in old oil. The mashed potatoes were lukewarm and had something, we still haven't figured out what the flavor was, but he wouldn't eat it.  The biscuit was dry and there was no butter.   All in all, this meal was awful and had no flavor. My daughter-in-law and I split a turkey pastrami sandwich.  It had chunks of what tasted like horseradish on it.  This was not in the description of the sandwich and neither of us liked it. I also had a small salad.  There has never been a salad that I would not eat until now.  The dressing didn't have any flavor and the salad must have been sitting around for a while because it was totally limp. The up side of this experience is that we also ordered mussels and they were the only thing that was good. Over all the service was very poor and the food so bad that we will NEVER go back. We spent over $100++ for a very bad experience.  The manager did comp the fried chicken meal.",

The two that looked the most promising were Olive and Ivy and Culinary Dropout.  We found parking and decided to try CD.  Walking in we had a choice of an hour wait, the community tables or outside.  Even in 100 heat we chose outside and were rewarded by a cooled and shaded patio that was quiet enough to talk on.  We passed on the cheese platter and ordered entrees.  Two hits and an ok on the salmon plate.  I had the beef stroganof and even though I do better this was the best rendition I had ever purchased.  Service was good throughout the meal.  As we were catching up on 13 years of not seeing each other we were not pressed to leave even though there were people in line waiting on a Thursday evening.  Just as a note:  This was my first trip to a Sam Fox restaurant and even being a sort of chain it certainly would not stop me from trying another of his concepts.",

    "text": "Nothing but mistakes! My wife and I went there for lunch last Friday. She ordered a salad, dressing on the side. I ordered a turkey pastrami sandwich that came with coleslaw. The salad came with the dressing on it, not on the side. The sandwich had the coleslaw on it (I had assumed, it was on the side) and it had spicy mustard on it. The menu did not mention the mustard, which I don't like. I asked the waiter if it could be made with the coleslaw on the side and no mustard. \"No problem \", he says. A few minutes later they brought me a new sandwich, it was exactly the same as before with the coleslaw on it and the mustard. This time the manager came over to apologize and tells me he'll take 1/2 off the bill. I told him that wasn't good enough, they screwed up both our orders and he should comp it all. He didn't seem to like that but said ok.",

The pork cracklings were just as advertised- we shared the BBQ pork belly nachos- be prepared for lots of cheese sauce. The pork belly had decent flavor nor could have been crisped up a bit.  Had the Seared tuna salad.  It was a decent blending of flavors, but the tuna wasn't the quality I have been spoiled by in CA.  The wasabi peas were a nice touch though. Overall.  Probably a great place for young men to gather to eat a solid variety of bar food and enjoy the sights all the young ladies were putting on display.  Just not my cup of tea.",

The pub burger was the standout, really good flavor, however we asked for medium doneness and it was very rare. The prime rib beef dip did not disappoint either. Nice garlicky note to it and bread was perfectly toasted. The fries were pretty much your regular fries.   Ambiance is trendy with extremely vaulted ceilings and a large open floor plan.  I noticed that the built in bench needed some repair as some of the buttons have come off. It's pretty dark inside so facing the bright windows will backlight your friends and hurt your eyes, my friend moved seats because it was bothering his eyes so much.",

    "text": "Three stars for my very first visit.   Three of us came around 6:30pm on Saturday, about 15mins wait for a table inside, I guess its pretty standard for any place in old town. The waitress was nice enough to share the drink menu and got us ordered some drinks while waiting. We had the Simple Plan, the Home-de Martini, and Acai Mojito. All were pretty good, but a bit pricey ($10 each)  So here comes the food. We ordered the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue, the first couple of bites were great, but it got dry and tasteless after three, and for softness, honestly, I'd rather go for the $3 Wetzels Pretzel. I had the Smoked Chicken Salad, friends had the Italian Chopped Salad and the Short Rib Pasta. Both salads were good, but not that outstanding. However, we all liked the pasta, it was very flavorful yet kinda soupy. Very good! We took the waitress's recommendation and ordered the Apply Monkey Bread (you're probably thinking the same thing as we did), Monkey bread? So it's basically small bites of cinnamon roll with small chunks of apple paired with  vanilla ice cream. It was very sweet and rich, three of us couldn't finish one plate...If you can't take a lot of sweet and pretty full, then do NOT order it.  The ambience is casual, spacious, and pub-style, but the music on Saturday night was too loud, we felt that we had to scream at each cross the table...",

To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan. They have tomato and bacon on them but I wasn't fond of the cheese they use. The fries were good though. Other entrees chosen were the smoked salmon - my friend raved about it, the chicken club - it was huge and on a yummy pretzel bun, and the turkey pastrami - also on a pretzel bun and pretty tasty. I saw another table near us getting the fried chicken and I think that's what I'll try next time I go. It looked really good. Oh I almost forgot, we ended with the salted caramel custard. It's topped with some caramel corn. It was really rich but very good. I definitely wouldn't be able to eat it all myself because it's so rich so you might think about sharing it.  Or maybe you can handle it and would want to keep it all to yourself :)",

    "text": "The feeling that you get walking into Culinary Dropout must be what it's like to drop some E (as I understand it)... You just want to touch everything! The interior design of the place is a crazy overload of eclectic textures (both tactile and visual) that somehow work together in a harmonious fashion: embossed walls, plush armchairs, supple leather couches, smooth wood tables, glittering chandeliers (ooohhh, shiny)... Sorry. Got distracted for second there. On to the food!  First of all, Culinary Dropout is a gastropub. Which means, with 25 different specialty mixed drinks (including a bacon-infused bloody mary), 44 kinds of beers and 27 wines to choose from, the alcohol is a-flowing. As I was in the mood to try something new, my server (armed with the knowledge that my favorite beer is Guinness) was able to steer me towards the 8 Ball from Lost Cost in California. Pretty tasty... Since I was there with a friend, we decided to do the tapas-esque feast and order a variety of small dishes to share: the Lingot du Quercy (a French, handmade goat cheese served with a cranberry compote and some crusty bread), Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue (pretzel balls served with a small cauldron of warm, liquid cheese), Artichoke Salad (thinly-sliced artichoke hearts and asparagus tossed with endive and Parmesan in a crisp dressing) and Grilled Asparagus.  All the food was very good, but the stand out for me (simultaneously as my favorite taste and biggest gripe) was the Artichoke Salad. Served in a bowl (you'll see why this is important in a second), the salad had an amazing flavor coupled with an interplay of crisp and tender textures. However, by the time we finished the salad, it was over-dressed and rather soggy. Any guesses why? That's right. It was served in a bowl (a fairly narrow one at that). With all the excess dressing pooling to the bottom of the bowl to drown the remainder of the salad, this particular taste experience went from awesome to melancholy pretty quick.  Aside from the space and food, one particularly nice surprise was the discovery that Culinary Dropout hosts live music as well. A local band called The Market started up about halfway through our meal. Sounding like an interesting bluesy/funk-ish take on Cake (they even have a trumpet), the Market was really very good. I'm looking forward to catching them again soon in my musical travels around town!  All in all, a very good first go at this newly-established gastropub. With the likelihood of fun times, tasty food and great music in the mix, I doubt that this experience at Culinary Dropout will be my last.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I love to go to Culinary Dropout for a relaxed environment with some great food. I recommend going there with a completely empty stomach and a ginormous appetite.   The first thing I suggest there is the The Clown Punch (for two of course!) It is served in a huge glass, with two straws! It tastes like fruity deliciousness, but it's not a pansy fruity drink, the BF likes it too! And it comes with some sort of foam on top that adds great texture and taste! I have yet to try their Antipasti platters where you can choose your meats, cheeses, vegetables and snacks, but I heard it is amazing as well.   As an appetizer, I highly recommend the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue - the best appetizer in my opinion! Think of light fluffy balls of perfectly cooked pretzels lightly salted that you can dip into a provolone fondue...it is just to die for! And the cheese comes with a little candle lit underneath it so it doesn't get hard and you can continue to munch on it throughout your meal. I do recommend splitting it with two to three people because you want to save room for the great entrees!   For our main meal we love to split the M.A.C. Burger which is very tasty as well! It is Culinary Dropout's version of a Big Mac. One of my favorite parts is the really light fluffy bread they use for the bun - sometimes its the care that you put into making the bread that can make a dish really stand out. Add that to a delicious meat patty with cheese and lettuce and you have got a killer combo. It comes with a side of fries that are perfectly cooked - not mushy or soggy or burnt. Just cooked to perfection.  If you get the M.A.C. burger, you are definitely getting bang for your buck!  As for dessert, a must try is the Apple Monkey Bread. It is baked to order (always a plus). If you enjoy a really great sweet treat at the end of a meal - you're in luck!    Besides the delicious food, there are other things that keep us coming back to Culinary Dropout. First, the service is great. You have waiters and waitresses that know the menu, appreciate a good meal, can make great suggestions (which I always love), and literally have you want to try different things on the menu from their great descriptions. I also love love love the decor in the restaurant. It's a very sexy restaurant with all the huge chandeliers, and at some tables you have huge chairs that you would imagine kings and queens sit in! In my pinon it all adds to your experience at Culinary Dropout.   This restaurant is an absolute must-try and one of my favorites in Scottsdale!",

No more bacon donuts.  Please, for the love.  2.  Overuse of truffle oil.  Dumping truffle oil on a dish does not make it gourmet.  Please stop.  For real.  Culinary Dropout is guilty of succumbing to these two trends.  That being said, the service and atmosphere make it forgivable.  Our server and the manager were hyper aware of how long we'd been waiting.  Even though it was not that big of a deal to us, it was nice to know they cared.  They mean well when it comes to cocktails, but they were a little lightweight for me, relying heavily on simple syrup and mixers to dumb down the alcohol.  Their beer list made up for it, though.  I've never had a stout in a can, but they managed to find the brewery that pulled it off.  Yeah, my ricotta gnocchi was drenched in truffle oil, but the sausage and mushrooms made it actually a pretty good dish.  And the beets were fresh and delicious.  I liked it, I'm not gonna lie, but I wish they'd stop falling prey to the trends and branch out a bit.  Culinary Dropout, you're better than that.",

We chose a relatively odd time of day to grab some lunch, so it was fairly empty when we were seated.  Our waitress was nice enough, but a little stand-offish.  She did her job right, so that's all I really care about.  After I decided what I wanted I gazed about the restaurant, admiring the decor while our waitress made her way back.  We ordered the pretzel bread with cheese fondue to start and I got the grilled cheese sliders.  The pretzel bread was DELICIOUS, even without the cheese dip.  The cheese dip just threw the whole dish over the top amazing.  I really loved this stuff, but I had to stop eating it so I could actually make room for the grilled cheese.  This app is more expensive than the rest, but there is easily enough to feed 4 people.  My grilled cheese sliders were wonderful.  They were served on the adorable little mini slices that look like they were made for fairies, and I just loved that.  So dainty!  The cheese inside was ooey, gooey, and melty.  Just perfect.  Plus, there was bacon, so how can you go wrong.  I think fries came with it, but I can't remember.  I will definitely make my way back here at some point.  I hope Mr. Fox decides to bring one closer to Downtown Phoenix because that would be awesome!  In an area where everything feels so contrived and pretentious, Culinary Dropout was a welcome haven to relax and be yourself.",

I went as part of a huge, crazy, birthday extravaganza so the service aspect is to be expected as a little on the slower side.  Their beer selection is pretty formidable, while their tap beer selection is definitely lacking.  I tasted the fabled pretzels with cheese dipping sauce and yes, they were probably the one thing that would suck me back into this place against my will.  The rib tip pasta wasn't bad, it was filling but seemed to lack a certain pizazz that would leave me wanting more.  The prices were definitely on the lower side for the area.  I'll probably come back here, and I'll probably like it but I probably won't know why.",

    "text": "This is definitely the See-and-Be-Seen place in that Scottsdale corridor!   I usually opt for sitting outside as I'm easily entertained with what's going on out there.  Lots of eye candy for both sexes here!  One thing you will notice right away is their huge drink list on the right hand side of the menu.  There are some really cool things to drink at CD and my personal favorite is the Ginger Margarita (El Matador) - Yum!!!  They also have an awesome wine and beer selection there on the back of the menu too.  I'm always so torn with \"Do I have a great glass of wine or one of these yummy cocktails???\"  Well the cocktail always wins out here!  For appetizer, you MUST get the Pretzel Bread with the cheese fondue.  They bring out fresh, warm pretzel bread nuggets that you dip in a yummy cheese fondue sauce.  It is to die for and I get cravings for this every once in a while.  Tough to schlep over there for a craving when you live up by Desert Ridge!  I've also had the Mussels appie as well as the homemade potato chips and both were really very delish.  Hubby and I have also done the Charcuterie and Cheese on the left in past visits and all were really wonderful with one of their nice glasses of red wines.  For entree's, there is really nothing that can go wrong here.  It just depends what you're in the mood for.  The fried chicken is BOMB, the Pork Belly Cubano is delicious and the French Dip is one of my go to favorites.    This isn't a cheap place - i had the pretzel bread, the mussels and the margarita and it cost me $30 before tip.  I was my own expensive date!",

I guess Scottsdale's restaurants are all about replicating the \"club scene.\"  The \"club\" ambiance can easily make a restaurant tacky, but I felt this place was classy/edgy.    We had our baby with us and it was his dinner time as well.  We asked the waitress if they had a microwave to heat up his Gerber food, and she said they don't have one.  Guess they make everything fresh.  Instead, she said that one of the chefs offered to put his food into a bowl and heat it in the oven.  Fantastic!  As for the food, we ordered the honey fried chicken and shaved prime rib sandwich.  Sandwich was on the salty side, but I enjoyed my fried chicken.",

They said they were pretty booked for tonight but found some seats for us till the next reservation in an hour.   We asked for samples of the soup it was broccoli & cheese soup it was good so we got 2 of those. Other culinary dropouts have different soups served and everyday is different. We asked for crackers & they didn't have any. They brought us bread but it took awhile & they charged us!   I got the fries chicken. It came with mash potatoes, coleslaw & a biscuit. It was good, but felt like the chicken was a bit dry, also felt like it had a honey(sweet) taste to the breading. The coleslaw was a bit sweet too. The biscuit was good.   Also we got the ribs it was huge! It tasted good though. They brought us wet wipes and a bowl for the bones. The meat came right off the bone!   They even have a live band sometimes. Also there's happy hour during the week. Parking is in the garage, it's free. Interesting decor & it's pretty loud inside. They also have a patio.",

The menu is quite small and boring, so that is why people go for these $24 ribs alot. Anyway, we waited 30 minutes to eat, only to find out they were out of the ribs. I wanted to bail, but we ended up staying and had an order of the average meatloaf and the fried chicken, which is officially a ripoff at $18. For that price, you get one breast basically (the wing and thigh cost them about a dollar), some cold potatoes, tiny side of slaw and a decent biscuit.    also tell the bartender that a beer should be filled to the top of the glass.",

We scraped that fondue bowl clean.   I had the garden kale salad and it was a great salad and a large portion size. Enough for lunch the next day!

My husband had fish & chips. While they were high-priced ($16.50), he said it was worth it because the fish was cooked so well and the batter wasn't too much like sometimes it might be at other places. His fries were excellent as well.     So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Only because I had the $10 bacon Bloody Mary. It's the only Bloody Mary on the menu, so I don't know if they have more of a basic BM that is not loaded with BBQ sauce. The piece of bacon in it was the best part. I certainly didn't get a buzz either. It's not a drink I would order there again, but it did have good fresh garlic in it.      All in all, this place is great and we would certainly recommend.",

It was such a fun atmosphere!  Then the manager, Garrett, came by to check on us. He kindly offered us drink recommendations and we ordered two rounds of what he mentioned. One was a spicy green cocktail and another was an Irish minty cocktail, both were totally fab. Then we got some house chips and dip - TO DIE FOR - and ordered our mains.  Hubs got the prime rib dip and it came out to total perfection! I got the Italian grinder for the first time and was so impressed. The side salad was exquisite.

My wife ordered the tuna salad which she loved. Aunt ordered the avocado toast which she wouldn't stop taking about. Great atmosphere and great food we will be back!",

This was my first time at the Scottsdale location and the inside is a lot different than the Tempe one. I love them both though! If you go you must get the pretzels and cheese. Walking through the restaurant you'll notice just about every table orders them! This past time I got the steak tacos. They were great although three cost you $17. Not complaining though. The drinks are great too! I can't remember the actual name of my drink this past visit but it was champagne, gin and strawberry simp. It was great! Im also a fan of their sangria. I got watermelon last time at the Tempe location while my friend got the pickle back shot. It's a mini bottle of Jack with a shot of hot pink pickle juice as a chaser. It was cute! Anyway I love culinary and my friends and I have most of our birthday parties/ events there. Will be back soon.",

I ordered Korean Shrimp and chicken on a stick for $8.00 happy hour price that took what felt like forever to get and received one skewer to split with my uncle?  We ordered 16 oz draught beers for $4.00 each which I had the Firestone Walker 805 which was great.  The pub burger and fries were delicious.  The waitress Jenny (I believe) was very attentive for the most part but was not very informative and appeared preoccupied.  Wrapped up with catching up with my Uncle I did not realize I could have ordered 20 oz beer and was not solicited or up sold.  All in all the place was very nice, clean and good food but appetizer was extremely small portion. I will be back for sure to see if my experience on a weekend is the same or better.",

For entrees we got the turkey pastrami, fried chicken and perogies. For dessert we got the banana cream pie and monkey bread.   Overall, the stand out items for me were the beets and (whipped) goat cheese and turkey pastrami. The big disappointment was the fried chicken - it had no flavor, the mashed potatoes were like a puree and the biscuit was cold - so I'd skip this item.",

    "text": "A few nights ago, I came here with my boyfriend and three other people. One of the people in our party was a friend visiting from California for the week. So we had our own little version of a lazy \"Friendsgiving\" at the Culinary Dropout.  We had to wait just a bit before our table was ready. It was our first time there so when you get the menu, the top portion is starters with several different cheese and meat options. We each ordered a drink, which varies from beers to cocktails. (My personal favorite is the Moscow mule. I ordered the pomegranate one, but I wasn't a fan of it. Thankfully I liked another drink someone else from our table ordered and she winded up liking my drink so we just switched. No harm, no foul!)  It was fairly dark and pretty busy so when our platter of cheeses and meats came in, it was hard to see without shining our phone lights on it to determine what meat was what. The waiter also rushed through what order the meats were in and none of us remembered what meat was what. We figured it out as we ate. Everything was absolutely delicious and mouth watering. All the cheeses and meats were completely gone by the end of the night.  We also ordered some entrees, like the fried chicken, fish + chips, and the salmon toast. The two guys who ordered the fried chicken said it was mediocre. I personally didn't try the fried chicken, but the fish and chips were good!  Between everything, we split the check evenly which came out to around $40-ish per person. (There were 5 of us in total.) This place is definitely way more expensive for a dinner outing, but it's great for big groups. There's a Bob Marley wall, with a mural of his face along with his famous song titles surrounding his face. I was also told that they apparently have music nights on Fridays and Saturdays.  Overall, decent food and good customer service! The waiter was very sweet and attentive. I forgot to mention our group ordered the Brussels sprouts plus the mac and cheese, which unfortunately were all sold out but our waiter was very kind about informing us and letting us chose a substitute for the unavailable starters.",

Items I would recommend. -A must is the appetizer pretzels balls with heated cheese.  Wow.  I ate way to much of that and should not have ordered and entree. -Mystery beer and Mystery Shot for $5.  Kind of fun to not know what beer you are drinking or the kind of shot you are having. Our waiter was always checking in, great service.

Food.... what we had was really good and flavorful. I would easily return just for the food. The pork belly nachos were awesome! Well done with the food!!  My reply to Samantha, Business owner. We were there Saturday night sept 8. I believe our waiters name was possibly Danny. When he did come around, he wasn't bad at all. And again, the food we had was excellent and WILL be the reason we return to ANY of the locations. I NEED more pork belly nachos!",

Well CD kept the Elks Lodge part and married it with Z Gallerie and I like it.  The waitstaff kind look out of place though..they look like they work at a country bar? Their gear doesnt really match the decor.   Besides that.. service was great and the food.. OMG. Ill be honest there wasn't a whole lot that really called out to me.. but what I ordered.. who cares what else was on the menu? Started with the pretzel fondue. Doughy deliciousness dipped in cheese and good cheese.. NOT nacho cheese. My guy is STILL raving about it 2 months later! Then I went for the Sweet Corn Canelloni and it was good. Im talking \"Last Meal\" good!  This place is worth checking out, without question!",

    "text": "A few friends recommended Culinary Dropout, so gave it a try on a Friday night.  While it was busy, it's a very large space with outdoor seating, and we had no wait for a table.  It's in the Scottsdale Waterfront area, many restaurant choices so guessing you can always find a spot to eat without a long wait.  The menu seemed a bit small, but some good choices.  I had the Rainbow Trout which was fantastic and I'd have it again in a minute!  My girlfriend had the Kale Salad with Bacon.  I tried it and liked it, but she thought it was so/so (too much dressing for her taste).  They also had a Bacon Bloody Mary on the menu (though neither of us tried it as we were having drinks later).  Would go back to try that.  If you are very conservative or a bit stuffy (or planning on going with someone who is), be prepared as it's a bit \"hipster\".  One odd thing was that they had a live musician.  \"Interesting\" choice of music...he started playing a Quiet Riot song (\"C'mon Feel The Noise\") but as more a folk song.  Not really our thing so didn't stay long after dinner (there were more lively venues elsewhere in Scottsdale).  Would go back again, though there are other great selections in Scottsdale that I might go to first.",

It comes with ham, bacon, mayo, tomato and lettuce on a pretzel bun. OMG it was so bland. Bacon was just ok. Chicken dry and bland. Pretzel bread hard and flavorless. I was so confused. French fries looked delicious but were dead. Husband ordered the ribs. Ribs were fantastic but again WTF on the fries and his coleslaw was like practically from a grocery store deli. Nothing special. Really disappointed. Went there years ago. Got the Fried chicken which was delicious. I feel with the exception of the ribs everything was IHOP or Denny's quality. Service was also slow.

We showed up right at lunch time and were able to be seated immediately. The crowd wasn't there yet.   They have an antipasta appetizer menu that includes choices of different thinly sliced meats and cheeses. We had prosciutto and two types of cheeses that were phenomenal. Followed that up with a kale and sweet corn (minus the corn) salad for me and a crispy shrimp salad for my colleague. My salad was extremely good and that they were able to modify it made me very happy.   The service was excellent and the pricing was really decent as well.",

Our server came to our table...he could have been a homeless person for all we knew...bearded out, tattooed, gadged earrings, and a nose ring that told us he was a rebel and perhaps did some prison time?  Rad.  He took our drink orders. Came back with our drinks and my date and I asked for straws...came back with un-covered straws.  What I mean by that is he came back with straws that were open to the elements.  Whatever.  I put my straw in and took my first sip of Water and to my dismay, tasted something sweet on my straw.  It appeared that something was on my straw!  Was it our servers sticky fingers?  I wasn't thirsty anymore.  Diner's beware, ask for a straw with caution. Drink responsibly.   We ordered the pretzel fondue for starters.  Very good. (Thanks Yelpers)  Asked the server for suggestions as to what was good there and he basically read the menu...thanks man....not helpful but thanks anyway.  It was then that I decided that it was my goal to see if I could make him smile or show some sort of human emotion  (I failed...). He was a bit of a harda$$.  Hard to crack but he was \"hip\"...fitting place for him to work. I ordered the ribs.  \"36hrs\" of something enticed me to get them.  Meh. They were boiled and had a decent sauce in them.  Nothing special.  My date got the fried chicken.   She offered a bite, I took a bite and grease poured out. Nasty.  That just tells me the oil used hasn't been changed for a while.  Mmmm...tasty.   Overall, great place to drink and people watch.  The Scottsdale crowd is great to entertain us people watchers.  Food and straws are funky.  For that I give them two stars. Maybe that's why their called \"culinary dropout\".",

    "text": "Second time around, and I am not above admitting when I was wrong.  This time the experience was way different. We had a server that was knowledgeable and on the ball - frankly, she was absolutely wonderful. The whole restaurant seemed in a cheerful mode and there was live music that I honestly paid little attention too. Even our fellow patrons seemed of higher standard than last time I visited CD.   Food My date had the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad, and I had the Chicken Curry. The salad was awesome, and next time I will probably go with a salad myself. I got the curry out, and I expected an Indian curry (don't know why) but instead I was surprised with a Thai-curry. Very tasty and very nice. It is served with potatoes (integrated, not as a side) which was an unexpected approach, but again very tasty.  Dessert was unnecessary after our meal, but I went for it anyhow and sprung for the Salted Caramel Custard. It was a different take, and it looked great. It was super sweet though. Not my style of dessert, probably because I am a self proclaimed gourmand with a texture and consistency obsession - but it is a very popular item, well worth trying.   Ambiance I was so surprised how much I appreciated this place in a different light once I got a great server. This place is still feeding of off its own hipness, but that is all right - in fact it has its own charm. In fact I really enjoyed just being here and embrace my surroundings. (Possibly sipping on a paperbag special)  Service We just had the best service. Our server was personable, and didn't hesitate to recommend when asked. I would love to give her all credit, but I don't want to hang out my fellow yelper by name ;) It made the whole experience just that much better.   I wasn't going to come back, but I am sure glad I did. And I will again, and again.. and whenever friends from out of town comes by.",

    "text": "Say what you want about form preceding function in the west-coast restaurant scene (and you'd be right), but Fox RC knows what they're doing. All of their restaurants are well-designed, well-staffed and well-fooded. [The notable exception being Olive & Ivy, which I feel is like the gorgeous girl at the party who talks a lot, but really shouldn't].  Culinary Dropout is one of Fox's best and, so far, most unique productions. It's a beautiful contradiction. Trashy class, unrefined elegance. And it's confident, in both its design and cuisine. The Fish and Chips (with a PBR of course) were the best I've had in my entire life, and not by a little.  But CD is not for every person, nor for every occasion. Establishments with this much arrogance forfeit the luxury of being able to rub everyone the right way. Generally, I don't see it as a \"girls night out\" destination or a place you'd go for Mom's birthday. Then again, I'm sure there are some classy women out there who'd appreciate the paper-bagged Pabst as much as I do.  CD is something to be experienced, at least once, even if you decide afterward that it's not your cup of tea. Stop by for dinner or drinks, appreciate the place for what it is,  and know that the menu means \"crusty bread\" in the best way possible.  Cheers",

Our server was also helpful and patient in answering all of our questions about the menu and drinks.  It was so freakin' loud and dark in there.  The gothic decor was very interesting...I'm not sure what style they were trying to achieve.  While the booths were comfy, it had more of an office-leather-sectional appeal.  I hope I don't know the interior decorator personally or I'm in big trouble!  The menu was very similar to Arrogant Butcher but with \"hoochie mama\" atmosphere, hubby dubs (it was funny, I thought I'd share).  Since hubby wanted the pretzel bread and provolone cheese fondue ($10), I decided to go light with my dinner.  The half dozen oysters  with mignonette and cocktail sauce ($14) sounded so good right then with a side of cheap salad with ranch ($5).  I know I should follow the old adage of eating oysters in the months that ends in \"r\", whatevs.  The condiments for the oysters are very basic, nothing exciting.  The refreshing Acai Mojito hit the spot, tho--must try!  The yellow Chicken Curry ($14) was rich with coconut milk, but not too spicy.  My hubby enjoyed the overuse of lemongrass that paired well with the Sierra Nevada pale ale.  We were so full, we didn't have room for dessert...darn pretzels!  It was a good time and at least we can say we've finally been to CD.",

I was really excited to try a mule, since they have a whole menu of different mules. I decided to try the ginger and mary ann mule and it was unfortunately not awesome. It didn't taste at all like a mule.. you couldn't taste the ginger.... also, the muddled fruit included blackberry (which tastes fine, but I dislike in drinks because of the seeds). The flavor was not awesome and they served it with the tiny cocktail straws.... generally that's ok, but not with a drink that has seeds in it! I could not drink this with the straws, they became plugged with seeds every 5 seconds or so. This is fairly unpleasant. Anyway, that is not a big deal, but I wish the flavor was better for a 10$ drink. I'll have to come back to try the food, but I don't know that this would be a drinking spot for me.",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale is one of Sam Fox's restaurants (the guy is behind such gems as True Food Kitchen), and it's always packed on weekend nights.  When I went there for dinner on a weeknight, it was also super-busy, and at 8 p.m., our party for three had to wait a half-hour for a table. Not bad for a restaurant these days-glad to see some are still thriving.  The place is pretty gorgeous. The beautiful patio has huge comfy seating, as well as a chandelier. There's another chandelier inside, and there's a giant purple wall where the kitchen is. This used to be Pink Taco, and they really re-vamped the space to give it a whole new feel.  Seating inside is also ultra-comfortable, with plush, couch-like seating and huge armchairs. The pretty atmosphere is juxtaposed with bare bones, paper menus and a casual staff, who, luckily, get to wear whatever they want. And because this is central Scottsdale, that means the staff is attractive and hip, as is the majority of the crowd. I can see why Scottsdale socialites flock to this spot.  The menu consists of comfort food dishes, including grilled cheese sliders, burgers and fried chicken. My party started off with the delicious Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue ($10), which melted in my mouth and were so good, we had to order extra pretzels ($2). It was rich and very satisfying.  For my entree, I had Ricotta Gnocchi with mushrooms ($14)-I opted to leave the sausage off. I was really disappointed with this. While I loved the fresh cheese grated on top, the gnocchi was drenched in this heavy broth that almost melted the gnocchi. It also wasn't a very tasty sauce. I guess I should have just asked for a thicker sauce, because I almost felt like I was eating soup.  The dessert more than made up for the entree, though. We had Apple Monkey Bread ($8), a concoction of warm and gooey, cinnamon-y bread drenched in a caramel sauce and served with ice cream. It was amazing and worth the trip to the restaurant alone.  While I loved some of the food, Culinary Dropout definitely had a \"beautiful people\" vibe that might put some people off. The service was decent for being that type of place, though, and if you plan on going, make a reservation, since I'm sure this spot is going to stay busy for awhile.",

Culinary Dropout is not your typical restaurant.  The menu items are creative but not so far out that the food isn't enjoyable.  I loved the crispy shrimp ceasar salad.  They include kale and lemon zest for an interesting twist.  And yes, I tried the roasted beets and caramel corn.  Both were delicious!  As for the decor - meh.  Its appeal is missed on me.  However, I did appreciate the friendly wait staff with their colorful tatoos and piercings.  I liked the fact that the restaurant tries to be different.  It does it well.",

    "text": "We tried this place out on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. While we waited for our table, we sat outside on the patio with our drinks. The patio space was nice and had additional tables for people to sit and eat. Since it was a warm night, we decided to eat inside. We were seated right in front of the stage at a long table. As the night worn on and got more packed, sitting at this table wasn't exactly ideal because so many people were standing behind us from the bar and bumping into our chairs. It was also pretty dark inside so I did have trouble reading the menu (that's what the flashlight app on your smart phone is for I guess). The ambience of the restaurant was very impressive with the purple tile walls and huge chandeliers. It reminded me of Vegas?  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful on drink and food choices. Our table started with the kettle chips and pretzels with provolone fondue. Ummm just have to say, the pretzels and fondue were fantastic!!! Huge hit at our table and we are still raving about them days after we ate them! The chips were also good.  I decided to split the chopped vegetable salad and sweet corn canelloni with my boyfriend. The chopped vegetable salad was a nice light note with a ton of vegetables and worked well with our entree, the sweet corn canelloni. The canelloni was really good but if you're hungry, I wouldn't recommend splitting it. For us, we knew it was going to be a night of drinking so we didn't want to over-do it. Perfect amount for the occasion. I stuck with my usual white wine for the night but many of my friends ordered speciality cocktails. I was able to try a couple and thought they were strong but good.   As we were leaving, the band came in and started playing. We could hear them through the loud speakers on the patio and they sounded pretty good, playing a few cover songs from popular pop/rock singers. It was definitely a fun place to go for a friday night and would return.",

Not surprisingly, the ramen was horrible.

My review is based on my one and only experience there and what I ate.  My other friends had their pork belly toast and said it was very delicious. If there is a next time, I would definitely stick with something safer (e.g. Burger).",

Turns out it was actually pomegranate foam to top off one of their cocktails. the clown punch. Since I am always down for anything pomegranate I just had to have it. Excellent cocktail! I totally recommend it!  My friend and I decided to split the fish and chips and a burger. Both were very good. Burger was good, but nothing too memorable. The fish and chips were awesome!

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is perfect for people watching and trying new drinks.   This review is based off two visits.   My first experience at C.D. was just to meet a girlfriend for drinks the opening weekend. The place was packed with the typical 'Dale crowd - I was prepared for this. It was very hard to get a bartender's attention. It was almost that they didn't see beyond those seated in a bar stool. My girlfriend and I had to go to the service well to get noticed and although the servers were probably annoyed, that's the only way we could get served. The drinks were good, pours were a bit on the weak side, but the atmosphere was great. Live music starts at 9pm or so.   My second experience at C.D.:   A few girlfriends and I decided to give it a try about three weeks after it opened on a rainy Saturday evening. Of course we knew to get there early so we wouldn't be waiting too long for a table. We arrived at 6pm and were quoted 30 minutes for a table. An hour later, I stopped the manager and asked him if he knew how much longer it would be until we got sat and he came back with menus in hand. We were sat at a round table with great big, comfortable chairs right in the middle of the dining room. We were quite comfortable and understanding of the long wait - especially because no one was opting to sit on their heated, yet damp patio.   For an appetizer, we started with the delicious pretzels with cheese fondue. Deli-sh! I prefer mustard, but tasted the cheese and it was great. There was enough cheese for dipping the french fries that came with the meal.   The entree menu is full of food that I would consider to be comfort food - choices that you know you may regret eating after you inhale the delectable food. I opted for the Turkey Pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun as suggested by the helpful manager that took us to our table. I, by far, had the best meal of my girlfriends. Two girls split a burger and salad (the burger meat tasted very fattening and \"meaty\" to me) and our other girlfriend tried the Prime Rib sandwich, which was tasty and a huge sized portion.   Overall, the food was good - but nothing too great. Our service was fantastic, once we got sat. The bussers were definitely cute as well. I would suggest Culinary Dropout as a place to see and be seen and for drinks. You can skip the food unless you really want to sit. The bar stools are hard to come by.",

I was there on Saturday June 15, 5 pm, asked for a quiet part of the place for 3 people, got it right away.  our server was really great, sorry, can't remember her name, but she explained everything, she was like a ballerina, loved her.  The $20 special is great:appetizer, entree, and a drink.  We liked the bruschetta, salmon and shrimp salads, way too much food, very pleasant.  next time I would split a salad, they are big and delicious.  Sam Fox, where do you get those cheerful, helpful servers?",

    "text": "After receiving a Fox gift card from a co-worker my guy and I decided on Culinary Dropout to go use it at. The atmosphere was fun, hip and cool with a warm evening to round it out with outdoor seating. We had already checked out the the menu before heading over so we already had an idea of what we wanted. To start I got the brown bag beer just cause it sounded cool and the soft pretzels and cheese which were amazing!! I also got the grilled chicken club and the \"cheap house salad\" yes that is the real name. My guy got the chicken curry. We were both pleased with the food it was good portions with good flavor but it was nothing that really wowed us. For it being a week day evening the place was about 2/3 with no wait for a table however our only negative comment during the meal was that it seemed to take the waitress quite some time to come back to us  to check in and offer the check. All in all it was a good meal and nice atmosphere.",

The decor is nice and the leather seating in the booths are comforting and the fresh smell of leather is inviting to relax and enjoy the experience. The staff is nice and attentive.   I ordered the Turkey pastrami sandwich which delivered a great mix of savory flavors that welcomed me with each bite. The fresh cut fries were crispy and soft which complimented the sandwich as if they were married in heaven.   Everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their food as much as I did. Some of the menu Items are priced reasonably but there are some that tip the charts.   All in all the experience and food was very good and this is a place that I might frequent after work.",

We visited CD on a Friday around noon, when I thought the place would be full.  Instead, we found it virtually empty, which is not usually a good sign, especially for a place so centrally located in Old Town Scottsdale.  I tried the cheeseburger, which the waiter described to me as the best burger he had ever had, hands down.  While there was nothing wrong with the burger, I would probably not order it again.  Sure, it's a cool looking place, and I'd go again if it were just for drinks, but I wouldn't recommend it as a restaurant...not when there are so many better restaurants so close by.",

The interior is kind of dark, and there was  a stage up front with a guy doing cover songs of all kinds of music from Micheal Jackson to Black Sabbath.  It sounds weird, but it was actually really fun and upbeat, lots of people in the restaurant were singing along. We were starving when we got there, so we ordered a few of appetizers to share.    Pretzels and cheese- so delish.  the portion size was big and the cheese stays warm because it's served with a little candle under the dish.  the pretzels had a crisp exterior and were soft and fluffy in the middle.  the cheese was light and creamy and maybe kinda buttery tasting. Pita bread and hummus- meh, nothing special crusty bread, garlic oil and balsamic- pretty simple, it also came with some type of bruschetta on the side, but it was weird because it tasted like salsa so i didn't really care for it.  for my entree i ordered the grilled chicken club (because I wanted french fries)  it was really good and very meaty. it has chicken breast, ham and bacon. I was getting full  from all the appetizers that i ended up eating the inside of the sandwich and took off all of the bread.  it had a lot of flavor and the havarti cheese was a good balance with all of the meats.  The service was really good.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I'd come back here.",

But we decided to sit outside under the shade and near the misting fans, and it was very comfortable.  The outdoor area is very cool and seems like a great place to get drinks and hang out with a group.   We ordered the pretzels and fondue as an appetizer and it was a huge portion! We also ordered the kale and butternut squash salad and fried chicken to share (it's all about balance!).  Everything was delicious!  The chicken was crisp, and flavorful, and the biscuit was amazing! The mashed potatoes were okay, and slaw was warm due to the heat and everything else warm on the plate.  The salad had a lot going on, but was really good! It was a \"softer\" kale than I typically have, so not sure if it was baby kale or what.  The service was great, the only downfall is they give such tiny glasses for water, which in 90+ heat, a bigger glass would be great!",

The plate was unfortunately drenched with oil and butter. Anything on the menu would have been healthier.  My not so great experience began sitting at the bar at 5:58 and was given a menu. When she came back a couple minutes later I asked for the happy hour menu, she looks at her watch and says sorry it just ended. It was 6:01. Thanks.  I ordered the Malbec, one of five red wines by the glass. We are out of Malbec, with attitude.  Music was way too loud, but I'll stop. I've been to culinary dropout a few times and the food is always good, but I've got other places to go for good food.",

The bar that opens to outside is nice and if I came to drink I'm Sure it would be fun! If you're coming for amazing food, skip this place. The food was the worst part and it's the reason I won't be returning. The pretzel sticks were extreme salty and the cheese with them was not warm. The tacos were the worst tacos I've had. the flavors were strange i thought tacos were a food that just couldn't be messed up, I was wrong. My daughter also had the burger which I figured I would taste to get more of an idea how the food is, that was not good either. The menu is very  limited and not much that caught my eye. I dine out very very often and this places food really needs help. I think with a menu change and food expert to come in and perfect it this place could be a True gem.",

I was a little disappointed in the menu as there weren't a lot of choices. It was a one page menu. Appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks on the other.  I ordered the Italian chopped salad as my main course and was still hungry after I finished it for 13 dollars. I ordered two cocktails that were 7 dollars a piece. I made it out of there with a 29 dollar bill adding tip left 35 dollars lighter and still hungry. Lesson here it's a bit pricey but overall a good experience. Staff was very friendly.",

Food was amazing and they have a great drink menu!!

All the fellas had plaid on and all the girls were hipster/clubby as AZ seemed to be. Great vibe...they definitely were going for a SF look and feel. The huge chandeliers had me entranced. I absolutely loved the Hodge podge of furniture at all the different tables. The dark purple wall colors gave the place a gloomy, hipster vibe...  You know how someone keeps talking about something after it's happened...well I was that person!! Thanks to Culinary Dropout I've been tainted with the BEST Monkey Bread to date!!  This place was crackin' on a Saturday night. Being a newbie to AZ, we had no idea where we should eat, but the name in itself is pretty awesome. Culinary Dropout...hmm, since they dropped out should I trust it?!?  I'm glad we sauntered in, even though it was a 30+ minute wait...I'm glad we roughed it out! We ordered a drink at the bar to kill the time. The girls loved the 8% Blueberry Cider. I went for the usu, Coconut Ciroc and RB.   Finally, we were seated. Our server was so busy, we had a pseudo server for a little bit, he brought us waters and our menus. Then sauntered over Jameson, our fun waiter. Fun guy, very entertaining.  We stared with the Pretzel bread & Provolone Fondue and an order of oysters (or something slimy in a shell).  The pretzel nuggets of goodness were tasty, lightly salted (I wiped all mine off). The provolone came in a cute little caldron looking thing...the texture was smooth and creamy. I loved the complimentary taste of the cheese to pretzel. The cheese wasn't overbearing, as many fondue types can be. According to the girls, the oysters were good...I'll take their word for it.  I ordered the Breaded Shrimp Caesar Salad (thanks Lent). I was pleasantly surprised by the dish. The breaded shrimp seemed on the smaller side, I almost mistook them for croutons. The flavor was good, as was the dressing they use. The portion was huge, as was the flavor...so I was a happy camper. I cheated and took a bite of the meatloaf, which was fantastic. Who doesn't love comfort food?!? The Asparagus salad was wimpy and I felt bad for my friend who ordered it...it was weak for sure!  I'd been waiting all meal for the desert. Monkey bread is top of the food porn chain. I was giddy like a 5 year old school girl! This warm desert was so good, I can barely describe it. Perfect pillows of sweetness, but not too sweet, with a hint of cinnamon. Buttery and light, but full of flavor, this desert was ON POINT! The ice cream was served in a separate dish, so it didn't melt because of how warm the monkey bread was, well played CD.  I'm glad they dropped out of culinary school!",

They were also extremely accommodating with making liquor and other substitutions for my gluten free diet. Deviled eggs were perfectly executed with just a hint of vinegary tang. The nachos were yummy, but I definitely think their game would be upped with shredded cheese instead of the velveeta cheese. All in all a really fun experience. I'll be back when in Scottsdale!",

Our appetizer, the soft pretzel bites with provolone fondue, was ridiculously good. The butternut cannelloni, however, was a little lackluster and I was disappointed in the limited vegetarian options.

    "text": "I like it, but I don't love it... that's how I felt after leaving Culinary Dropout. Out of all the Fox restaurants I've been to this one isn't the worst, but not the best. I HATE True Food but LOVE the Arrogant Butcher. Culinary Dropout was somewhere in the middle with everything- service and food. Our server was OK, he was kinda slow in between courses and when we wanted to order, but since we were hangin' with friends it didn't matter too much.   Of course the pretzel fondue is amazing. They weren't served as hot as at arrogant butcher, but still very good. I had a salad, which was fresh and the chicken I ordered on the top was REALLY good. It was grilled and full of flavor, which is sometimes lacking in chicken you get on top of a salad. Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food- I tried my Husband's grilled cheese sliders, which were greasy, but obviously good given its ingredients, however it didn't seem like enough food for a full meal. We skipped dessert and had foyo across the street.   So in conclusion, if I was in the area and really had a taste for some pretzel fondue I would go back to Culinary Dropout.... although the pretzels and wetzels are better... now I'm confused...",

    "text": "I got the pleasure of having a work luncheon at Culinary Dropout and since they were trying to impress us food and service was impeccable. Got to try lots of menu items and the manager talked about each one. It was clear he (along with all the staff we interacted with) were truly passionate about the restaurant and the food (and drinks) served. He made it seem that top notch service was their top priority and they would bend over backward to please guests. Of course hearing things like this are common in these types of situations where they are hosting our luncheon.   However, I went back there a week or so later on a (very late) Friday night and was pleased to discover my experience was just as good even when they thought I was just a \"regular\" guest. Our server, Jesse, was probably the best server I've ever had. The kitchen was already closed when we arrived but he gladly managed to whip us up some of their infamous monkey bread despite this fact. Which paired perfectly with the chocolate stout canned beer. All in all, huge kudos to culinary dropout for practicing what they preach.",

    "text": "After going twice, Cullinary Dropout is likely my least favorite of the Fox Restaurant Concepts properties.   The first time, I at least got to laugh. I ordered a large-format Chimay Red Cap which the waitress was uncomfortable trying to take the cork out of, thus requiring the attention of an overly confident manager. As the manager was mid-sentence in his explanation of how skilled he was at handling the situation, the cork shot by my face and nearly took the eye out of another patron sitting at the table adjacent to me. (Which made for an uncomfortable remainder of my stay.)  That said, there are some tasty bites on the menu including: soft pretzels & provolone fondue and the pork belly Cubano.   That said, the entree's are sometimes less than memorable. I've had better short rib pasta, the beer battered fish and chips are okay, and I'd rather go to Lo-Lo's for chicken and waffles.   Also, last time I went I got stuck at a small table by the door on a relatively chill evening and then waited 20 minutes for a waiter to show up. Service thereafter was painfully slow.   If you're looking for a relatively upscale beer experience, I'd suggest going across the street to Yard House. If you're looking for a more wine oriented time, I'd recommend venturing elsewhere.",

About a year ago I had some clients, or are restaurant venture capitalist back in NYC, in town and we stopped by CD for drinks and a casual dinner. Great time, they loved it, so we went back last Saturday.  Got there, drinks at the bar went perfect then we were sat, were all went downhill. Our waitress was this shorter blonder girl with longer hair, wish I had gotten her name to call her out. Took her 30 minutes to get us water and drinks, blamed it on the bartenders being all new, which is a lie because the bartenders had taken excellent care of us 20 minutes earlier. Spilt two of the cocktails all over us then proceeded to tell us they ran out of pretzels but if we wanted she could have them make it, 30 minutes after our order was placed. Did you run out of them or forgot to put it in? Instead of a beef barely soup she brought a beef stroganav, mind you she wrote this order down on paper twice because she said she lost the pad the first time. Burger with no cheese? Arrived with cheese. Then comes the bill at which point she tells us that we shouldn't worry she didn't charge us for the pretzels she never brought or the drinks she spilt on us.   Then she left us with more words of wisdom, you should all come back on a Monday and Tuesday when it's slow and empty, Saturdays are too busy and we should expect everything to get screwed up.  Are you kidding me? I think they've started employing either complete trashy idiots or people who are drunk or high while on the job.",

They didn't have the steak for my co worker but did a special order Asian infused skirt steak for him---- AND he said he was in the mood for chili fries so the kind waitress Karen said she would make it happen. The soup that night happened to be chili, they had cheese and fries---- BEYOND delicious! We were a rather large, loud and knit picky group. She joked with us, did everything we needed and was prompt.  We got an array of things from the menu. I got a burger--- sorry can't remember which one bc I had had 6 drinks at this point. (Acai mojito was smooth & alcohol stuffed!)  We were considering a drive back but the $100 roundtrip cab ride was the only thing that made us decide to stay local to downtown Phoenix.

Sad bday face :(    It's busy on a Friday and the waitstaff is very good at keeping the pace fast so they can turn the tables over (I get it, it's a business).  But they also brought us 2 sodas when we only ordered one, but still charged us for it.  Since we were with family, we didn't want to make a big deal about $10 on a $100 plus tab.  But for that, can't do more than 3 stars.  But, I'll be back for the burger.  However, too many missed details for 5 stars.",

The cheese was comparable to warm canned spray cheese (Easy Cheese). We also opted for a create our own antipasto platter. Everything was overly salty, my tongue literally burns. Then....we stopped there. Even if we wanted to continue with our dinner order, it would not have been possible. Our waitress stopped three times. First to take our drink order; Others delivered the food we did order, second to take our food order and we flagged her down to bring our bill. The 2 stars are for the decor and vast drink menu.

Although the fried chicken I ordered was only lukewarm, it was very good. I almost sent it back but figured they would only warm it in a microwave oven. I wonder if it had been prepared ahead of time since it was served to me in about 5 minutes after I ordered it (the menu said it \"would be worth the wait\" as if it would be cooked upon ordering). Nonetheless, I was happy to get in on a Thursday evening, had excellent service, a very good fried chicken dinner, and a nice cold Guinness beer.  I will definitely be back but will ask if the fried chicken is prepared ahead of time or at the time of ordering; I'm sure it will be worth the wait!",

The hostess was very nice and apologetic, and told the bride-to-be as we were being seated that they'd send over some complimentary appetizers to make up for the wait and lack of indoor table.  Except those never came.  Then, half of the things people at the table tried to order they were out of.  And the waitress (who was probably slammed) forgot the drink my friend ordered.  Next, my friend ordered the bacon and parmesan grissini, which were literally the little skinny hard breadsticks that you get for free at many italian joints.  Like 4 of them.  For $3.  My friends and I ordered entree salads that were the same size as the house salad my other friend ordered, but for twice the cost.  And the food was pretty bland overall.  There was an amazing guitarist playing music inside but it was SO LOUD we couldn't even hear ourselves talk.  Big bummer, as I had really hoped it would be as good as I remembered.",

First before we went to the restaurant we checked to see if we should reserve a spot but the entire day was open so we decided we where just going to go. When we got there, there were two girls at the front desk staring at an iPad. When I walked in they didn't say anything I had to start the conversation. When I said we had 4 she said there was no room and a fourth five minute wait (but from what I could see there where at least 40 spots open) so We waited like ten minutes and we're going to instead go to the Salty or thirsty Lion and as we where walking out the door they said they had a table ready. We didn't take it and went to the other spot and it was amazing. So good and excellent service. I would never go to culinary drop out again",

Don't think about 'fall off the bone' ribs - think about 'gnawing on a piece of raw meat' ribs.  So why did I give this place 4 stars?  The 7 other people in my party all had food that was awesome, and their pretzels and provolone appetizer is worth it.  They seem to hire only attractive, blonde waitresses, which I'm not going to complain about, especially since everyone was very helpful and friendly.  Our waitress helped us choose drinks, food items, and skillfully shot down the table next to us when they tried to hit on her.  Service was prompt, and my glass was always full.  As I said, my ribs were bad.  Really bad.  But again, balance that against the pretzel and provolone appetizer, and amazingly, it was a pretty good meal.  My girlfriend had a sandwich, which was incredible, and the rest of the table really enjoyed their meals.  The atmosphere is fun, although not overly exotic.  They have some large, comfortable booths, great for kicking back in, and they have a lot of outdoor seating with misters to keep things cool.  I'll definitely go back, but I'll order something a little less risky next time.",

Grilled Cheese Sliders tasted like cheese from a can & \"Chicken Club\" is a dry, tough chicken breast on huge, stale bun with wilted lettuce. Pair those with a $6.50 bottle of beer and your on par with airport restaurants. Informing our server that we weren't happy with our food got us a free appetizer for \"next time\" after he talked to the Manager (who never visited our table). I worked in restaurants for 20 years and that's not how you handle a complaint. Too much competition in Scottsdale not to go elsewhere. A shame, because it used to be pretty good.",

    "text": "I've been anxious to try CD since the Pink Taco departed a few years ago and Fox Restaurant Concepts put Culinary in it's place. I took my bestie here last weekend to celebrate her birthday. We got there before the 'rush' of dinner arrivees landed and scored a primo spot on the patio for good people watching.. not in the patio bar.. but just in the right spot... well, so we thot. Get to that in a bit!  We started with catching up as we usually do and opted for mojitos...plain and simple. The waitress was a little.. hmmmm .. what should we describe her as. Well, she sat down when I was putting on a refresher of lipstick and asked me, \"Why I was putting on my lipstick?\"  (cheesy smile). I could not tell if she was being funny or patronizing me. So I came back with a .. \"Ummmmm, well, because I wanted to put my lipstick on and leave it all over the mojito glass?\" (cheesy smile.)... She laughed and took our order. Weird. But laughable. We opted for the pretzel and fondue app. Both of us had heard much ado about it on yelp, of course. And it was going by all around us... so it must be good. She asked if we had ever had it and when we said no, she asked \"What rock we had been living under\".. \" Oh just our own.. little rock in the library up the street\", I said. Really? Does this girl want to go with my wit? Or with my sarcasm? I can't tell. :-) Let me say this.. that stuff was to die for. Worth the heaven in your mouth.. worth the TWO workouts you will need after you have it! Nextly, we both ordered salads.. I ordered a chopped veggie salad and added shrimp. My bestie a greek style salad.. (the name has left me! ) with salami. Both were very good! We switched to Pinot Noir red wines. NOW comes the seating issue. Prom girls have arrived. Like about 8 of them and their 1 mom. They sat in our seats. The mom took pics in from our table. Over our food. Over our wine. Finally we give up our two seats not being used. Which was weird for the seating because its lounge type seating on the patio. After about 20 minutes of hovering , Mom departs. Our waitress did become funny and fun over weird and just hard to figure out. Overall it's a great place. But people seating behind us at the entrance on random seats. Taking our seats. That would have a been a cool thing if the waitress would have stopped that. Pricing is Fox Concept pricing. Valet your car. No way without parking across at Fashion Square and hoofing it over gonna work.",

We were a large group of girls, and had a bit of a snotty server. We also had a pretty big issue with the timing of the food service. So why five stars? Because when the manager saw that we weren't pleased, he went way, way above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Our night went from questionable service, to seriously one of greatest in a matter of minutes, all because the manager cared to make the difference.  Its things like that, that makes one restaurant stand out from another. I will go back again and again. Love the place, so impressed.",

Honestly it looked like just lettuce and cheese on top. It was pretty sad for their impression of a Cesar salad. She told the waitress that she wasn't pleased with it. Moments later a nice man came and said if he could get her anything else. She didn't get anything else but he was really nice and apologetic about the situation. I was very impressed by that.

You get 10 pretzel rolls and a crock of fondue served on a hot tray so the cheese stays warm. This was very tasty. Easily an appetizer for four. Next, we ordered an appetizer of Thai chili wings. They are served on a bed of coleslaw. Again, very tasty. The sauce is sweet with a little hint of heat. It was just the two of us so we didn't even make it to a sandwich or an entree. But certainly the appetizer experience was very good.  Our server was very good. Professional, pleasant, and knew the menu very well.   The place was quite noisy at lunch and I would anticipate it would be the same at dinner. So if you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy your meal this would not be it.",

I believe aside of one salad, hummus and pretzels there wasn't anything to eat. Asking the waitress for other possible off menu options, none were offered. Definitely disappointing for me.

The manager came over to check on us and thanked us for coming in.  If you are looking for a fun place to feast, I highly recommend checking out the Culinary Dropout!",

    "text": "My best friend and I went here for dinner last night before a show.  There was a 30-minute wait to sit inside so we opted for patio seating.  The sun was shining on the patio so they put the shades down for us.  That fixed the sun problem but also eliminated the breeze and kept the misters away.  By the end of our meal we were pretty hot.  Our waitress was absolutely awesome.  She was really friendly and gave great suggestions.  Based off the yelp reviews we had to try the pretzel fondue and we weren't disappointed.  This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  There were a lot of things on the menu I wanted to try but I decided on the beef stroganoff.  My friend got the prime rib dip.  The stroganoff was decent but I would definitely try something else next time.  My friend enjoyed the prime rib dip but said it wasn't worth $17.  I was very impressed by the service level here.  Both hostesses and our waitress were just exceptionally friendly and really made the experience great.  I would definitely come back for more pretzels and to try something else on the menu.",

    "text": "I am surprised by the low ratings this place has gotten, because I had a wonderful experience here last night! Granted, it was a first date, so maybe the stars in my eyes had more to do with my companion(?) I really liked the open-ness of the place, the colors and low lighting. The chairs were pretty comfy too! Here's what happened:  Unsure of what our future plans were, we started with the antipasto menu (not available in the bar, I heard). A couple of cheeses, veg's and meats were really fun to share and made for good first date food.  After deciding we were too relaxed and close to the movie we planned to see, we ordered dinner. Holy hell- I cannot say enough about the butternut squash ~pure genious! It combined my absolute faves- butternut squash and ricotta cheese, along with some mushrooms and brussel sprouts (very small pieces-dont be afraid!) It was like dinner and dessert rolled into one. We also tried the spare rib pasta. It was good, but definitely overshadowed by the other main course.   As first dates go, I found out that my companion has a sweet tooth, so bring on dessert-dessert! Our server ferverntly recommended the custard, whichis, as I had previously told my new-date, something that I absolutely adore! It came in a glass overflowing with carmel popcorn! The p-corn had nothn on the custard! OMG! SO great! Terribly rich though. We couldnt finish it. (but after everything else we had, its not a wonder why)  Our server was amazing as well, she provided us with food ideas and always made sure our drinks were filled. She checked in to see that we were happy, but didnt bug us. It was a great experience and I would definitely go again!",

It's a pub, that has been \"Fox-ified.\"  I love coming here with friends just to drink and have some light food, before a night out.  Their cocktails are all really unique and really tasty.  My two favorites are the Bacon Bloody Mary and the Sauerkraut.  The BBM is self explanatory....bacon infused vodka is used, and even served with a piece of bacon instead of the typical celery.  I'm not normally a huge bloody mary fan, but if I'm here during the daytime I always order it.  The Sauerkraut martini is amazing....gin, elderflower, orange marmalade, and dijon mustard.  With the mustard in it, it is a very savory cocktail...which I love.  Goes perfect with the soft pretzels & fondue, which is my favorite app to get.  As far as entree's, the short rib pasta is my favorite, simple and delicious.  Everything I've tried here is really tasty...but again, think of it as classy/modern/unique/upscale bar food, not gourmet restaurant food.",

The food was innovative and fun.....   however, as time passes and money is made, the food quality starts to fade....so sad.       the meat and cheese dishes are standard fare. the pretzels are a hit or miss;  some days fresh and doughy, other days shriveled cold and left-overed-reheated tasting.  The Easy Cheese Whiz fondue is still fun to share with a big drunken group there to people watch on the outdoor patio.    The pasta dish with rib meat is standard.  Could be a little fresher and hotter.  The fried chicken, which used to be large cripsy juicy pieces are now sad shriveled dry  pieces.   The highly anticipated dessert with the Caramel popcorn was so congealed and stuck together that I think I cracked a filling....Again, so sad.....    There's a reason the restaurant is no longer packed to the brim as it used to a few years ago;   it has the same sad vibe as the Pink Taco when it was nearing it's decline.      if you like to party with the ladies looking for their next ATMan card, this is a decent place to go on the weekends.     I'm going to ask my gay couple friends where's the next trendiest place to eat would be;  they know style and food.",

I love the cheese platter- pretzel anything there- drinks are always spot on-. We spend usually 2-3 hours each time were there just drinking and eating till we can't move. We usually go mid day and a lot during the week which is why we've never hit a real busy time. Tonight well be going so it'll be our first nighttime visit.

    "text": "My first (and last) experience at Culinary Dropout was not good. I'd say it was a total disappointment, but I wasn't exactly looking forward to dining there from the beginning. I was hoping the food would change my mind...not so.  A friend suggested meeting at Culinary Dropout for a recent Friday night dinner so my husband and I headed that way. I am not a huge fan of Fox restaurants, but our friend has somewhat of a connection to Mr. Fox himself, so we humored him and went along. I was well aware that it was a Friday night and we would have to wait, so I wasn't surprised when our friend informed us that it would be 20 or 30 minutes. No big deal. We ordered drinks from the bar and enjoyed the people-watching. There isn't a lot of room to wait, but we shoved ourselves in a corner and enjoyed the show. And holy crap, there certainly was quite the show! The people visiting this restaurant were some of Scottsdale's finest. Plastic surgery, skin-tight mini dresses, and gelled hair galore! I almost threw up in my mouth a little...  So yeah, did I enjoyed the people-watching? Absolutely, but it started to get rather old when our thirty minute wait turned into forty-five minutes and then over an hour. Our friend finally went up to ask about the wait and happened to mention his connection to Sam Fox. That brought a manager out rather quickly. Logan came and greeted us and apologized for the long wait. He also offered to buy us appetizers and drinks (I assumed that meant the alcoholic kind) once we were finally seated. That sounded great to us, so we stayed to wait a little longer. I also want to add here that the hostess (who was dressed in something that seemed incredibly inappropriate at a restaurant...shorts so short her cheeks were hanging out the bottom) was very sweet. She apologized regularly and kept us informed when it was almost our turn to be seated. And honestly, it wasn't the long wait that was so annoying...it was the fact that we waited more than double the time we had been quoted.   So anyway...we finally got our table and our server promptly greeted us and we ordered our drinks. I had the mojito (which was pretty decent) and my husband had a glass of red wine that he enjoyed. Shortly after being seated, Logan, the manager on the floor, sent us over three free appetizers. Awesome! We had the burrata (very creamy and great flavor), the pretzel and fondue (not bad at all, but doesn't compare with Windsor's), and an order of bread and olive oil. After enjoying our free apps, we placed our order for the main course. I really struggled with what to order...the menu just didn't appeal to me at all...but finally decided on the grilled cheese sliders (sans bacon).   And then we waited. And waited. And waited. Our server didn't come to check on us and the food was taking foooooreverrrrrrr. When it finally arrived (maybe 30 or 40 minutes later), I was not pleased. The sliders lacked any flavor and the little bread slices they were on were far too crispy to eat easily. After one bite, I let my husband finish them. He didn't enjoy them either. Our friend liked his salad, but was so annoyed with the long wait for our meals that he called the manager over again. I really did feel bad for the guy. He was clearly working his butt off, but something was going terribly wrong that night. In fact, we overheard him comp several other meals throughout the evening. He agreed that we waited far too long for items that have a four minute ticket time and offered to take them off our bill. Well, at least we were getting a free meal out of this whole ordeal.   Needless to say, we were not happy with our experience at Culinary Dropout. The entrees were disappointing and the waiting time was ridiculous. Unlike many other Yelpers, I was not at all impressed with the decor of the place and the live music, while a good concept, was pretty awful. The guy there that night was singing covers of songs I like, but he just did not sound good. At all. Oh and we could barely have a conversation over the extreme volume in the place. What really sealed the deal? When we received our check...which we believed would be comped...we saw that they still charged us for our drinks. And those drinks were not cheap. I would have had no problem paying for drinks (they were fairly tasty and we didn't have any problems with them) except for the fact that we had been told that they would be taken care of. Unless we heard the manager wrong...which could have been possible since it was so incredibly loud in there. Either way, it was a surprise and left a bad taste in my mouth after such a frustrating experience.   I seriously doubt that this kind of thing is a regular occurrence for Culinary Dropout, but for whatever reason it was pretty bad that night. I don't plan to return.",

    "text": "This is definitely a first for me. As fans of Fox's restaurants for over 15 years, we  were very interested in trying one of his Phoenix concepts.  With so many from which to choose....I'm afraid we just made the wrong decision. We purposely did NOT pre-read menus from any of restraints on the Fox web page. We were sure that wherever we chose to visit would more than likely be above average, so we wanted to be surprised.  Well....we were. When we arrived, we were immediately seated by the usual beautiful young woman one usually finds manning the hostess station at any of Mr. Fox's establishments. The dining area was brilliantly lit and seemed to have ambiance on the forefront. Very nice place for cocktails or, in our case, just a bite.  Without going into too much detail about the food (the other reviewers will certainly cover that area), I'd like to discuss the menu itself.   We tried a few things, all were good some were better than others.  The issue we had was fairly obvious....the menu was almost identical to every other bar and grill you'd find EVERYWHERE else!  There were few, if any, original or insightful appetizers or entrees to be found.  I mean I'm the sandwich section, there was an Italian Grinder, a chicken club and a French dip??? My god I couldn't think of a less thoughtful list of sandwiches if I tried.   Now maybe the point IS that the chef is a Culinary drop out this didn't make it to the class where ya learn the important of menu building... but nevertheless makes the best food ever!?  Either way, the food was good, we'll be sure to try the new location coming soon to Tucson.  After all, most things in our town taste better just cuz they're home!",

It took 10 minutes to get our drinks after we sat down, which is pretty poor considering the restaurant was not busy at all. Once we did, the drinks were not correct, and the waters we asked for were not brought. That may seem trivial, but we were pretty specific that we would like water as soon as possible since we had just gotten off a plane.   Food came out super slowly, and the quality was not as described, which was disappointing. Thumbs up on the ramen bowl- it is very spicy. The French dip was yummy, and the pretzels and cheese is a must. Nachos, fried chicken, grilled cheese were not ones to try. Any place that uses Kraft singles tasting cheese is a no.

Their mixed drinks are all very creative. I ordered a drink with muddled jalapeno, tequila and pineapple... it was delicious! My husband and I shared the pretzel bites with fondue to start. It is a giant portion but the pretzel is fresh and delicious, definitely the star of the show. We decided to split dinner after the massive amount of pretzel bites. We took the recommendation of the waitress and split the fried chicken and honey biscuit. When it came out the portion was still large split. The chicken was crispy with great flavor and was served with a biscuit, coleslaw and mashed potatoes. Everything was wonderful. I would definitely go back!",

The portions were small but considering I was going shopping/trying on clothes after dinner that's probably an okay thing.   We loved the little pretzel rolls and fondue as an appetizer. I'm pretty faithful to a vegetarian diet but since my parents were in town and they 'don't believe in the whole not eating meat thing', I obliged their request to eat fish and got the salmon. As guilty as I felt eating it... It was pretty good.   Like most of the Fox Concepts restaurants, the bar looked like a lot of fun. I think next time I visit I'll just Uber over and drink my dinner.",

There was a thin layer on our pretzel cheese and on the mashed potatoes, they should of been brought out quicker.

    "text": "Culinary dropout has good flavors, but the wait for both a table and the food once ordered was overwhelmingly long. The decor is inviting and modern, despite its very low lighting.   For appetizers we ordered the black mussels and burrata. The burrata was a bit stringy in texture, a little more than I would have liked, but the cider flavor really shined and complemented the green apple slices. The black mussels were nice, but the broth was the star, with an extremely rich and tasty flavor.  For entrees I ordered the korean ribeye cap, and was able to sample my family's orders. The over arching theme of the food was great flavors that were very interesting and tasty, but a little too much salt / seasoning for my liking. The korean ribeye was a good modern twist on an Asian style dish, but a bit cloyingly spicy. The bistro steak was nice, but again a little too salty. Both were a nice medium rare as ordered. The beer battered cod was nice and crispy, and the pork belly from the ramen was extremely tender.  The desserts we sampled were the monkey bread (baked fresh in house) and the black-bottom pie. Unfortunately the wait for the dessert took more like 20 minutes than the advertised 12 for the fresh monkey bread, but I'm leaning towards saying that the wait was well worth it. Both had great flavors and were not overly sweet. The graham cracker bottom of the chocolate pie was a nice touch to counter the caramel topping and fluffy chocolate filling. The vanilla ice cream nicely cut the initial sweetness of the monkey bread, marrying well with the cinnamon and warm bread pieces. Overall, the waiters were very nice and the experience in general was nice.",

The drinks were pretty good, though I've had better. I had one drink with banana liqueur in it and it was a bit too sweet for my taste- while my friend had a sake cocktail that was phenomenal.   The appetizers were really what stole the show! We started with the pretzel fondue as recommended by friends and went nuts! The portion was surprisingly large and the fondue was delicious! We then enjoyed a make your own charcuterie tray with everything from homemade potato chips to goat cheese. The charcuterie tray was a little pricey since it is by item, but still worth it.  Most of all, our waiter was just rad. He looked like K. Fed and had a sick fedora! He was very attentive and checked in with us throughout the night- even when the restaurant got super busy due to outdoor seating rushing inside with an impromptu storm, he still checked in!   My only meh moment was the live music- it was great but WAY too loud. We weren't even close to the stage and could barely hear half of our party because of how loud it was.",

    "text": "What an amazing experience!!  Took my family here (so wasn't cheap for 4 people) and we were all thrilled with the experience.  We had to eat outside as they were all booked up for the entire evening. So if you plan on trying this place on a weekend...reserve your table a few days ahead. Sitting outside was made tolerable with their misters.  It was actually nice being outside as the live blues music going on inside would have been a little overwhelming.  If you're not into screaming over live music while you're dining out...eat outside or come before the music starts.  We shared the pretzels with cheese fondue...and I would have been happy just ordering more of that for dinner.  It was a near religious experience.  They had a nice (but smallish) selection of some craft beers and I had a nice IPA to go with it.    My daughter ordered the pork belly nachos...I'm pretty sure they used the same cheese fondue on them...delicious.  they should just put that stuff on everything...even dessert. I had the fried chicken.  It was actually the least amazing dish out of the others.  Very good, but I just liked the other stuff better.   My son got the ribeye cap...melted in your mouth.  Yeah I had dinner envy at this time...I choose...poorly.   My wife got the sweet corn ravioli.  Not like any ravioli you've tried.  Very different...in a good way.   For dessert we split the banana creme pie and the bread pudding.  Both were exceptional.    You get smallish portions here.  This is a good thing.  It allows you to try a lot more of what they have to offer, and I believe they are appropriately priced for quality and portion size.  It's great to be able to split an appetizer, enjoy your entree, and still have a little room for dessert without risk to permanent bodily injury.    I will definitely be back when I visit the great state of Arizona again.",

Its a solid option for groups or families that want a great meal near the mall, but honestly I think you could find better or more interesting options nearby.

Located in amazing Old Town Scottsdale, Culinary dropout brings a Vegas type theme restaurant to Arizona. Great food, DJ spinning the tunes, amazing servers, a fantastic outdoor seating area and a single guy's dream of ladies everywhere. We were so focused on the eat of the night we just ordered a few appetizers and a ton of drinks. While I don't remember exactly what I had I can tell you it was still delicious. Their signature cocktails are outstanding and the dinner menu did look fantastic. There are 3 Culinaries in the area so choose wisely based on where you want to go afterwards.

Although there aren't many low calorie options, it's a good place to splurge on fried chicken, gravy & biscuits which was delicious.  We got a charcuterie of capocollo & prosciutto with a sheep cheese & a white cheddar, all of which were delicious. Could have had more cheese on the plate but the meat quantity was good.  The seared ahi tuna salad was pretty good, nothing special.  Our server was pretty good until the end. She was very knowledgeable & helped with any all questions. When it came time for the bill, for some reason she slipped up & kept taking a while.  I would like to come back & try more things from the menu.",

Our server, Jaymee was really, really incredible. I just turned 21, and she was super helpful with recommending a drink to fit my tastes.

FOX CONCEPTS Company running it also owns Arrogant Butcher downtown PHX. The quality there has always been fantastic and I have eaten there many times.   The decor at Culinary Drop Out Scottsdale is a cross between a homeless shelter and a 70's disco.  Gaudy chairs and dark colors. It also looks liked they hired the homeless to run it.   No uniforms,  no sense of staff.  There was an openly gay waiter (not that there is anything wrong with that) flailing around in a long lab coat... another server looked like he was just rescued from a desert island in grubby clothes and a beard like ZZ TOP sporting a man bun.  The hostess was nice but far too underdressed. Many of the waitresses had far too many tattoos exposed.  With all the restaurants in that area one could find a more inviting and appetizing place to eat.",

To top it off, it was a bad band.    I went back today for lunch and liked it a lot more than my first experience.  I sat outside on the patio and there was good people watching.  Once again, good beer.  I had the pork belly cubano... it was ok.  There was only one piece of pork on the whole sandwich and it was pretty fatty (understandable considering the cut).  Overall it wasn't too bad, just really rich.  My friend had the italian grinder and loved it.  I saw the burger come out and that looked really good.  Fries were ok.    I think I will go back and just stick with apps and beer... but I won't go back on a weekend.  I would recommend going during the day anytime of the week for a better experience.",

For round one, (the two gals)  we ordered the fries - $6, the antipasti for one(chef's choice)  - $7, and two of the grilled cheese sliders at $2.50 each.  Service was prompt and all the food was very tasty.   I knew about the bacon on the grilled cheese, but not the tomato.  I am not a fan of hot tomato, so I would have asked them to hold it had I known...but that's preference, not quality related.  The bread, chesse and bacon were just right...and I could have made a meal of these alone. The fries are thin cut, fresh and very nicely seasoned.  Everything you could want in a fry - and generous basket of them provided! The antipasti platter was my favorite.  Choice today was brie, sopressata, almonds and roasted tomato.  The bread served with it was perfect...crusty on the outside and heavenly pillow within.  Round two (the man joined us after he got off work), we ordered three additional grilled cheese sliders, the crispy shrimp and the chicken tenders ($5 each.)  I ordered the red wine cooler ($4 happy hour special, available in red, white and pink.)  As the server suggested - it was cool and refreshing with blackberry flavor. Loved the shrimp...similar to popcorn shrimp but perfectly exectued.  Hot and crispy outside, tender inside and lots of flavor.   Was let down by the chicken tenders.  Nothing wrong with them, per se...but everything else was so well done, the plainness of the chicken really stood out. Will definitely be back for happy hour...and as my bank account grows, I'll look forward to working my way down the very cool drink list!",

Now, I'm a nondrinker so I can't really rate the drinks but their cocktail list is insane.   We started with the soft pretzels with provolone fondue which was TO DIE FOR. So delicious and flavorful. I recommend it to everyone.   We also ordered some cheese and meat off the antipasti menu which was delicious as well. The cheese was very moist and flavorful and the capicola had just enough pepper to give it a hint of spice.   For entrees, I ordered the short rib pasta which had delicious flavorful short rib in a yummy red sauce. It wasn't too heavy or too light. Just right. My boyfriend ordered the MAC burger which is basically just a glorified Big Mac only better. My mom got the smoked chicken salad and my dad ordered the coq au vin. Everyone seemed to be happy with their choices.   We had to skip on dessert because we were so full after wards but I can't wait to come back and try some more delicious food!",

Not a huge menu, so My mom ordered the shrimp salad-grilled, not fried like it comes, I ordered the Chicken Salad and my husband ordered the Italian Salad ( I think it was called that)  The pretzel app was amazing. The fondue tasted so amazing I could eat it every day haha. The oil for the bread had a sweet balsamic at the bottom and it was amazing, one of the best Ive had.  The salads were awesome. My husband said the best salad hes had in a long time. My mom and I liked ours as well. Husband also got a purple haze, which is a beer he said he has only seen in Denver, so he was happy about that.  We sat on the patio (even tvs with the game on it) and the heaters were on, man we live in AZ. for sure. We had a great time. I would def. suggest it. The only thing I didnt love was the music was super loud at times, then would get quieter, then super loud, so it was hard to talk, even outside, but I will still be back. Great Place.",

    "text": "I went with a group of 5 for dinner on a Friday night.  The wait wasn't too bad and we were seated at a nice, round table.  We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and dinner.  Our drinks finally came out and were disappointingly low on taste and alcohol.  10 min. after ordering, our entrees came out.  The waitress told us that our appetizer wasn't ready so she brought out our meal.  The entire meal felt very rushed.  Finally, our appetizer came out, midway through our meal.   Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was barely satisfactory. There are many restaurants in town with more creative menus and better service.",

The food was really goodand served quickly, although I do wish everything was a bit warmer when served... prices are average of the Waterfront,as well as the portions, and our server (Johnny I believe...) made great suggestions and was extremely friendly. Try the Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel bun, pretty delicious. Ill be back:)",

We stayed at the W hotel so it's only a 5-10 minute walk, very convenient.  This place had a cool vibe (half bar/half restaurant-like atmosphere) and the acoustics of the place was perfect for the live band.  The restaurant decor is very unique, not like any restaurants in SF or LA, so just for that alone I'd recommend this place.  Service was great, there were beautiful ppl everywhere, and our waitress was SUPER nice  (we got comp'd for a lot of our drinks! thank YOU bride!).  Wonder if the chefs are really culinary dropouts - regardless, the food was pretty damn good!  MUST GET THE SWEET CORN CANNELONI! OMG.  seriously.. OMG.  4 people at our table ordered that entree and we all cleared our plates faster than anyone else.  The prices were very reasonable (with dinner+drinks+tax+tip, each person paid around $25).    I just wish they took reservations!",

    "text": "3 stars with the potential for more if they add happy hour deals that include their cocktails because their mixologist deserves an Emmy or whatever the equivalent is for drink inventors!!   Specifically, the Last Word, which includes Hendricks Gin, Green Chartreuse and lime juice garnished with cucumber and cherries and the Ginger Margarita that wreaks of ginger with Milagro Silver, lime, Cointreau and ginger agave syrup.   Service was good and patio seating is comfortable.  The menu items sound so creative. A genius composed the copy for the menu. Everything sounds so delicious. And, the food is good but it falls a little short of the expectations set by the titles. Don't get me wrong. I'll totally be back.   Here's what I've tried so far:   I've had the soft pretzels & provolone fondue a couple times now and they're tasty but there's more cheese than pretzels... not exactly a problem if you order something that comes with fries and you're a dipper, though!   The pork belly cubano title is misleading but the description sets it straight: \"tavern ham.\" It's not pork belly. It's still yummy. Think awesome ham sandwich with cole slaw on top. And, it may be even better the next day! (The sandwiches are giant - I had to bring half home) This may be my favorite menu item so far.   The shaved prime rib dip is served with fontina cheese and a side of the onion soup for dipping. Personally, I prefer au jus and I probably wouldn't order the onion soup on its own... it was very sweet! :(   The butternut squash cannelloni is good but it ain't cannelloni. It's rectangular ravioli. Four of them. Again, plenty of food. Good flavor. Would've preferred more brussel sprout \"leaves.\"   I tasted my dining companion's short rib pasta and the pasta was over cooked. Might be worth trying again. Seemed like a hearty dish.   Finally, finished up with the monkey bread. It reminded me of refrigerator biscuit dough topped with cinnamon bun frosting, apples and cinnamon. The ice cream flat out sucked like generic grocery store ice cream.   I think, in the future, I'll chose a cocktail for dessert! Seriously! They're really creative and delicious.",

    "text": "\"Bring earplugs with your tastebuds\"  We came here for my wife and mom's birthday for dinner and let's say we were not prepared for the high decibel ambiance.  We had what was recommended from Michelle L. and other reviews.   1. Soft pretzel with provolone fondue - 4 stars. 2. 32 hour ribs - 4 stars 3. Salted caramel custard - 5 stars.  4. Sausage and mushroom Gnocchi - 3 star  After walking in you have beautiful chandeliers and modern decor.  There is a stage for live band music which we sat in front of.  Thankfully we were finished with our meal before the band began.  We could hardly hear our waiter and he had difficult time hearing us as well.    Although there was a good crowd in the restaurant and they didn't mind the noise level, but noise level was too high and distracting for us which the food was not able to overcome.  If the chef or owner was truly a culinary dropout, it was because he couldn't hear the instructions in class.    If you find this review useful, funny, or cool please check accordingly.",

Perfect snack while waiting for entrees. If I wasn't pregnant, I would have definitely enjoyed one of the many cocktails or beers. Pretty good selection!  Main course was the butternut squash canneloni for me and the meatloaf for my husband. The canneloni was absolutely delicious! Loved the sauce and veggies. Mmm! Husband really enjoyed the meatloaf and green beans. Only minor complaint is that the mashed potatoes were a little over-whipped for our tastes (we both prefer them to be a bit lumpy).  For dinner, we couldn't pass up the apple monkey bread and vanilla gelato. So, so good! It was like adding chunks of apple pie filling to monkey bread.  Definitely worth the trip from Gilbert!

Not bad, but an overwhelming smoke flavor. Also tried the chicken meatballs, which were deadly dry. The sweet potato cannoli was inedible, and the Cajun chicken was so salty none of us could eat it. The salmon was okay, and the fries are good. We went late and they were out of many of the entrees.

    "text": "Let me say first that I have and currently work in the restaurant industry, both as front and back of house.  The food was very good, as I would expect from a fox concept. We shared the pretzel fondue and the pork belly Cuban. The both were great and came very quickly (I am a sucker for all things pork belly)   The food alone made it a 4 star( a bit pricey but it IS Scottsdale fashion) however the atrocious service made for a 2 star review.  Our server started off ok, greeted us and got our drink orders (a couple of iced teas) then brought the drinks and took our food order. Had I known that getting a refill wouldn't happen I would have paced myself to really savor it.  When our food was ready out server simply handed it over the community bench ( and over my girlfriends head and shoulder) rather than walking it around table side. This seemed downright lazy, and a bit risky and one of the items was steaming fondue for the pretzels.  We didn't see the server again for the duration of the meal, no check in on the food, and my glass sat completely the whole meal. Now I am not afraid to ask for what I need, nor do I need/expect constant attention; however our server was MIA and all the other staff was hanging out by the expo/hostess stand and I wasn't about to go chasing someone down.  Finally when the server reappeared it was to drop the check, then he was kind enough to ask about the refill as he took my card and brought to go boxes.  The last straw was when rather than offering help packing up the to go he dropped the boxes and ran. This left my girlfriend to handle the cast iron mini-pot of fondue ( which held over a tea light was very hot) luckily years of hot pans in kitchens have left my fingers able to handle hot things. I don't see how most people would not burn themselves, seemed like an unsafe practice to me.  Left a 10% tip which is as close as I get to stiffing a server. Having worked in their shoes and seeing servers on the other side of the pass really working their but I generally aim for 20%-25% grat.  Most likely will not return, and will be a little wary of any Sam Fox place I haven't been before.  Recommend any of the other fine Scottsdale eateries in the area just not this Fox concept.",

The wait staff doesn't take away empty plates, don't ask if you want another drink, again they are too busy chatting it up with other staff and adjusting short skirts that are riding up to high into their privates (so weird/gross when they are taking your order). Won't be back. Thirsty Lion had better food.",

This is something I would not normally order, but at lunch for a coworkers birthday this was brought out and I'm glad it was. So good. I had the shrimp Cesar too, and was impressed. The ice tea was also tasty. Looking through the drink menu I will be back, after work instead of during, so I can give them a shot!",

We started off great, our server was friendly, and she was all smiles. Things didn't progress so well. My friends drink didn't come with straws and she needed them to stir her drink. We had to seek someone else's attention. Our order was taken and we ordered the Pork Belly Nachos. Our nachos were delicious, however we were left desiring more meat on them. There was so little meat that i felt like i was eating nachos from Taco Bell. We ordered two plates to share. When the waitress came to check to see how the food was i asked for two sides which she said would be right out.... we left and still didn't get our sides; yet the waitress made eye contact with my friend and i multiple times, and even brought our check and asked if we needed anything else. We kind of felt neglected as the two tables at each side of us had more visits from the waitress than we did. Hopefully the service is something that can be worked on, as this really is a good establishment, and the food and drinks were great!",

Decor is upscale/modern; dress code is anywhere from jeans and a T-shirt to polos, button downs and slacks. Music is a bit on the loud side; so, if you're looking for an intimate, romantic setting, you might want to try this place at a different time. It is great, however, for meeting up with friends or bringing out of town visitors to...which is what we did. The food was quite delicious and creative. I had the salmon...was perfectly seared and paired with black rice; something I've never had before. My sister had the M.A.C. Burger, and said multiple times that it tasted just like a McDonalds Big Mac....only that the Culinary Dropout's burger blew McDonald's Big Mac out of the water. We had one issue with a meal, but they were quite apologetic and made it right. Oh, and their cocktails are awesome!! I had the Pomegranate Yuzu Mule...delicious! My husband had the After School Special; that's dangerous...tasted just like fruit punch. Anyway, definitely try this place out; you won't be disappointed.",

Still busy on a Sunday night but we were able to walk in and get a nice table on the patio so that was nice. Our server was definitely attentive and happy to offer recommendations and answer questions. My friends got the Fried Chicken which they loved. I got the  BBQ Ribs with coleslaw and  fries. They had a good flavor and the sauce was good but I doubt I would order them again. The rib where super fatty, and the meat didn't come off the bone very easily. The coleslaw was heavily dressed. And I had to complain but that was the smallest serving of fries I've ever seen at a restaurant. Although they were tasty.  I'm usually a huge fan of the food at Fox Restaurants but this one didn't hit the mark.   I would got back and try something else but I'd probably more likely go to one of their other restaurants first.",

I'm not that hard to please and like chicken salad almost anywhere. Nope. It was way too saucy, did not cling together at all, and the sauce just tasted bad. Terribly disappointing. My husband got the meatloaf which was alright. Everything was WAY overpriced. The only good things were the service and the pretzel fondue. This place must be for tourists. Yuck.",

    "text": "Never disappointed at the Culinary Dropout! This is my second visit to this location! We started out with the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue for an app. They were delicious! The pretzels and fondue came to the table and at first impression, I was overly impressed. The fondue dip came in a pot-type thing, raised above a small candle as it was supposed to look like it was heating the fondue for appearance purposes, (but trust me, the fondue was the perfect temperature). The pretzels were baked to perfection, with a beautiful crust-type outside and a chewy inside! For my entree, I ordered the Grilled Chicken Club, and oh my gosh was this also amazing! It had the perfect amount of flavor and the chicken was cooked great! I had a side salad (with Lemon Tahini Vinaigrette) which was also amazing! I can't say enough beautiful things about this place, and I'm not even done yet! Our server, whom I'm not sure of his name was so polite and knowledgeable (long haired, skinny male, with a beard). We left him a $25 tip on our very reasonably-priced bill. My date and I dined for about $40 (not including alcohol), and it was beyond worth it!   Flashing back to my first visit, I ordered the Pub Burger, which was also cooked impeccably!   To conclude, I love Culinary Dropout. They are always super busy, at least on weekends, so make sure to make a reservation! Everyone was super helpful and nice. They also had a DJ last Friday night. They have a beautiful patio, and a huge bar! The mood in this restaurant is very \"trendy\" and slightly dark, making for a nice, loud romantic night out (unless you're on the patio, which is quieter), or a great night out with the friends! I've noticed a lot of bachelorette parties and prom dinners also that occur here, so it's for sure a hit all around the table!  Once again, I cannot say enough amazing thing about Culinary Dropout! I will be back!",

We rolled in at around 9:30p and were quickly greeted and sat down. The place, located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, is pretty \"swanky\" and really spacious. A great place for large groups I'd say. We got a table in front of the kitchen and had some waters to start.   After looking over the daunting menu for a couple minutes, we decided on what to go. We started off with the homemade potato chips and pretzel fondue to start, both of which were really good. I'm partial to pretzels so I liked that a little better, but the chips were also good with the dip. I had the something punch to drink which was really good, love the mixing of the fruit juices. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich which comes on a pretzel roll which, from what I ate, was delicious. I just had my wisdom teeth removed and can only tolerate so much chewing, so unfortunately I couldn't finish but I have my leftovers in the fridge! Anyways, everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, and we finished it all off with the apple monkey bread which was also very good.   It's the kind of place that isn't really pricy but it adds up (between the four of us our bill was $100+, but that was also with apps and drinks, so it's really worth it. Plus the food is really good. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "In a sentence: Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings, amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town, on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food, and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus.   After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we weren't disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste.   Musketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po' Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal.   and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.  Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their \"famous\" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back! The three of us died over that one!   To my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you! Bring your most expensive IT bag, a pair of oversized shades, maybe a sweater (the outdoor heaters really didn't work) and your most predestroyed designer deconstructed jeans and get ready!! It's gonna be a blast!!",

    "text": "I finally followed my beloved baseball Giants of San Francisco to their spring training home, and after consulting Scottsdale yelpers, Culinary Dropout seemed like a good place to eat a late dinner on the first night.  Living in the South Bay Area, I generally assumed that relatively low population density equates to nothing but stripmalls and chain restaurants. Going to Scottsdale has shown me that this doesn't have to be the case.   I do realize that the Fox group is a major presence in the food and nightlife scene in Scottsdale. This preeminence clearly isn't gained by aggressive annoying ad campaigns and stupid slogans...or by offering horrendously large portions to lure in lazy, poor, obese people.  They are successful, I imagine, because they take a good concept and consistently deliver it to locals and tourists alike at a reasonable price.  I likes me some swanky San Francisco restaurants, where you feel like you have to prove your worthiness to the server. And then you fork out $180 bucks and step over homeless people to get to your cab.  Culinary Dropout satisfies the swanky without the price or the pretentious service (not to mention the lack of homeless drug addicts passed-out in a puddle of their own excrement). Thank you Scottsdale PD police state!  I started with the 'nutty Irishman' cocktail, if I remember correctly. Jamison with Guiness reduction and some other stuff. Never heard of adding a Guiness reduction to a cocktail...or reducing Guiness at all, but I am a fan. My special lady had the cocktail with the pomegranate foam on top...step aside Ferran Adria, this is the best use of foam i can think of.  The Cuban pork belly sandwich appealed to me...you had me at pork belly. My dainty little girlfriend had the chopped Italian salad. My sandwich was bomb-diggidy, although I was less-than-impressed with the chopped salad with Kraft-tasting Italian dressing on it...but I would never order that, so I'm not hating.  While I'm on it, WTF is with every single Scottsdale restaurant putting some kind of 'chopped' salad on their menu? Just sayin'. That seems like some iceberg, cucumber, and carrot thing you put ranch on in the Midwest somewhere. I digress.  I was too full to try the monkey bread...my mom makes that, and I love it. We had to come back another night to try it, and it did not disappoint. And neither did the people-watching on a Friday night. They must have a 23yr old blond girl generator somewhere in this town.  The title tells it all: Culinary Dropout. Not that they can't cook here, it's that they don't feel the need to put on their tall hat and adhere to some antiquated notion of cuisine. They make good food that people like in a festive and swanky atmosphere. Just because they have an amazing space and a well-thought-out and well-invested aesthetic concept, that doesn't mean they have to try and make inaccessible food that you need to download the Oxford Food-Lovers app on your iPhone to translate the menu. And every employee I interacted with was oozing with genuine hospitality.  Next year when I come back, and I WILL come back, I will definitely stop by again.",

We were seated outdoors, but with their open-to-the-outdoors layout, it really didn't matter.  We asked several different staffers to turn down the music volume.  They all responded with a well-rehearsed statement (having been asked before) that they have no control over the extremely high noise volume of both the recorded and live music.  The food:  nothing special, and certainly didn't warrant putting up with throbbing eardrums.   The smoked chicken salad was formulaic:  a portion of greens, a portion of chicken, a portion of nuts, etc.  Not inspiring.   The ribs were reasonably delicious.  Substitutions for fries were made cheerfully.   The service:  high school level - well-intending but naive, with requests made repeatedly.  In sum, go here if you don't have much to say to your companion because the noise level won't allow you to be heard anyway.",

Having never been there before, we decided to give it a try, but unfortunately don't ever see ourselves  returning.  We just didn't get a good vibe from the place from the minute we walked in -  (very stark and non descriptive in decor) and it was virtually empty with the exception of a few tables the entire time we were there.  While the bartender was nice - he was very young and inexperienced.  We ordered the Manchego cheese and Capiccola from the happy hour menu and a bottle of Malbec.  Flavoring of both cheese and Capiccola were very good.   Bartender encouraged to try the Fried Chicken, which he touted as their most popular entree - but we declined and decided to keep on our exploration of another local restaurant we'd yet to try.  They may also be dealing with a sewer problem.  I used the restroom and the smell in there was atrocious!  Appears to be a place that might cater to the young Scottsdale crowd wannabees.",

    "text": "Where do I begin....first, I was excited about trying Sam Fox's new concept since my wife had drinks and appetizers there the night before. Walking up to the front, we were greeted by a line of folks waiting to put there name on the list. This took literally 15 minutes to put 2 names on the \"wait\" list.  As we checked in, I noticed 4 tables open and the host told us it was an hour wait as he rifled through 3 pages of names.  Being in the restaurant business for 15 yrs I knew he was either under quoting or had NO clue on how to work the front.  We proceeded to the bar to order cocktails and waited 10 minutes for someone to greet us. Bar was full and there were 4 bartenders working and not focused on the customers. After ordering a bottle of Shiraz, I noticed the same 4 tables were still open from when my wife & I arrived. We ran into a couple that we knew and they mentioned that they were going to join their friends on the patio while they waited for a table.  We were told that these tables were first come, first serve, but evidently this was incorrect information.    Supposedly, the General Manager was irate at one of the folks we were with and he told ALL the servers on the patio not to serve us food or drinks. I guess he was going to get back at paying customers. Not too bright and probably uses one chopstick to eat Chinese food.  It is now 9:15 and we are 15 minutes over our desired wait time communicated by the host. I then search out for one of the servers to see if we can order food since all the other tables were eating. She tells me that her GM told her not to serve us at all for taking the table and how we ruined their night and they are not able to make their tips. Nice! I then ask if I can speak to the GM and she brings me to the host. Seriously!!! The GM has been working the host desk and not the entire restaurant???   We decide to leave after not trying anything on the menu and being forced to eat somewhere else at 10:00pm after arriving there at 8pm. Upon leaving my wife went to let the host/GM know how terrible of an experience it was and he told her that he could seat us now. Ridiculous. I will never be back.  The \"funniest\" thing about this whole evening is that the person who pissed off the GM is Sam Fox's neighbor - guess who will be hearing about our experience first hand!!",

We pretty much devoured it on the spot. (we were hungry). I got the smoked chicken salad (minus the Gorgonzola) and my husband got the turkey pastrami sandwich. I was excited he ordered it because it was my second choice. Both the salad and the sandwich were awesome. Usually when I ask for no cheese, somehow there is always cheese. We could see when our order was up and saw a server thoroughly inspect my salad for cheese. I was convinced they made a mistake but when the salad was brought over, behold, no cheese! In fact, the server was inspecting it to make sure there was nothing in there!

    "text": "I tried 3 drinks here.  Their Mojito was good, but not outstanding.  It had blueberries in it.  The Smashed Irishman was fantastic - frothy, lemony, well-balanced and smooth.  According to the bartender, it's their most popular so far.  I also had the Bacon-Infused Bloody Mary.  This is a bloody mary mixed with bacon-infused Absolut with a sliced of cooked bacon used as a garnish.  While it was intriguing, I'm glad I had it last because it was overloaded with flavor (spicy, smoky, salty, tomatoy) and quite filling.  For food, I ordered the crusty bread with olive oil and 12-hour roasted tomatoes, which I combined to make open-faced sandwiches.  So that's about $5 for the food and about $30 for the drinks.  The cocktails are expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I'd try just about any of the ones I saw on the list.",

I was also tipsy on maybe 3 vodka sodas so the 1 hour wait didn't bother me either...  but after I came back to the second time I was like eh... the food was less than what I remembered - this time I had the french onion soup and a salad and the cougar-ish ambiance was beginning to annoy me...  I must admit  though that the waitresses are AMAZING! during both visits - they were VERY accommodating, first to my dairy-challenged husband and second time to my vegan friend where they modified the chicken salad by adding more veggies and taking the chicken out so she can eat it.  Plus its priced moderately... money tawks!!!",

    "text": "I had high hopes and expectations for Culinary Dropout; it was my first food stop the night I arrived in Scottsdale. Perhaps it's partially my fault, but my experience fell short of my expectations.  I came on a Sunday night and sat at the bar since I was dining alone. It was pretty packed even for a Sunday night. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, and most was filled up.  I got the pork belly nachos and pierogies. I must say the pierogies were delicious, but the pork belly nachos are what really let me down. There was hardly any meat on them - I got pork belly in less than 10 of my bites. The chips were sub-par from a bag and everything was just \"meh.\" I've had much better nachos.  For my drink I got the pink margarita which was also just ok.  I had a few patrons standing very close to my seat trying to order drinks for a while which was a bit annoying when dining, but I get I was sitting at the bar - yet it didn't seem like just a bar hangout on a Friday night or something where it's so crowded that everyone stands and hangs around.  If I lived in the area I'd come back and try this place again with some other food choices, but as of my first experience, I wouldn't say it blew me out of the water.",

I had the smoked salmon on avocado toast with an egg sunny side up, capers, and tomatoes. It was very tasty but way too much oil (it almost looked like they poured the oil on top of it once the dish was made-strange). Then I had the kale salad (no cheese and lemon tahini dressing on the side) with cauliflower, roasted Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, pine nuts and some other veggies- everything was tasty, dressing was delicious. My husband had the fried chicken and found the dish very average and bland.   An interesting thing about this place was that the people working there have no dress code, the hostess was wearing torn jeans, other staff had flannel shirts, no uniform color among the employees so it's really hard to say who works there and who doesn't. They charge $2 for soda water. Drink refill was a bit slow.",

My go to is the nachos! they are just soooo good. I get them as my meal because they are so filling, but definitely a good app to share. The turkey pastrami sandwich is always a great choice and will leave you more than full. As well as the honey fried chicken and biscuit!   Food has always been on point and drinks are always on point.   This location has very different vibes than the Tempe location. I recommend both, just depends what you're going for. This location looks is smaller and looks \"fancier\" for lack of a better term. The one in Tempe has games and is more spacious but is ALWAYS crowded, so beware!  Love this place, definitely want to try their vegan meals next time!",

The menu has plenty of meaty options- not a ton of meal-y things if you're vegetarian but honestly if I went back I'd probably just order myself the big bowl of pretzel bites and not share.

Without protein, this is an excellent choice for vegetarians! The sauce is TO DIE FOR. Herb butter, smoked shallots and parmesan coated the ravioli. This complimented the butternut squash beautifully.   I love coming to Culinary Dropout on date or with friends. Service is always friendly. It's great place to stop for dinner before hitting bars/clubs in Old Town.   Tip, make a reservation!  This location does not offer the same fun games as the Tempe or Phoenix location.",

The location is amidst a whole plaza full of shopping centers, so parking is ample in those inside parking garages (and free!) From first glance it definitely looks very chic and a stylish place to be. There are outdoor seatings and indoor seatings and bar seatings. We requested to be seated outside because the weather was fantastic. Every outdoor seat has a parasol, so you're mostly protected from the sun . The server was friendly, vocal, and very prompt so there was no problem with service. Bathroom was also clean and stocked! Now for the food, we ordered the pretzel and provolone fondue for dipping. This was delicious, the pretzels were hot and freshly done, so it made us feel good about consuming it too. Cheese fondue was such a cute and smart idea as a shared appetizer. For my meal I ordered the vegan curry (forgot the exact name), only one of its kind. It was full of herb flavors and it felt healthy even as I ate it. I have to say it was spicy (and I'm korean, so I can take spice pretty well). But it was a delicious spicy for me. The eggplant in the dish was also very well prepared. All in all, I would definitely come back, but I live in another state LOL. But try this place even as you visit!",

Although she wasn't bad, she was younger and too comfortable with being \"casual.\" She made my fiance and sister pretty uncomfortable with her lack of personal space. She was wearing a crop top, jeans, and converse and when she went to take our orders, she would get REALLY close to each person. Mind you, we're sitting in our seats, her stomach and crotch area is right at our face level... she would let her upper thigh/hip bone area touch their shoulders. It was awkward. But, I won't take a star away from the restaurant for that weird experience.",

The place is small and extremely crowded on a weekend, call the morning of for dinner reservations.   This was the second time being in Arizona from California and I was recommended to come to culinary drop out.  I had the rainbow trout and my sister the French dip.   The rainbow trout was $19 and didn't come with anything other than some undercooked green beans. Smothered in butter and completely tasteless ..so make sure you ask for lemon. I really only ate a few bits and took it Togo.   The French dip was $17 the fries were old and the sandwich was dry and the bread was soggy. If you ask for ranch you get tarter sauce. Personally Arby's has better French dip and a quarter of the price. It maybe was worth $8/$9 bucks.   I probably wouldn't come here for good quality food, it's the atmosphere that hyped this place up and the location.",

I wanted something lively and walking distance to old town where we could party after dinner.   The place was packed when we got in around 745pm. Luckily I made reservations ahead of time, the wait was 45 minutes. The interior is quite dim and loud. They have live music playing. This night it was a mix of country music. For dinner we went with their sweet corn ravioli, rainbow trout and 36 hour pork ribs. The food took a while to come out but they were busy. The drinks looked good too but we had a long night at the bard and clubs ahead of us so we skipped the drinks here. The sweet corn ravioli was delicious. It had a great creamy sauce, with a nice salty sweet savory flavor. The ribs were falling off the bone. The rainbow trout was cooked well and not dried out. Service was great they checked on us often. My only complaint was how hot it was inside. They have the AC on but they keep all the patio doors open so it doesn't hold any of that cold air inside.   Overall, the food was delicious. And the live music was fun. It wasn't our favorite genre of music but it was still a fun lively environment. It just could have been cooler inside.",

The ladies were nice and the drinks were excellent. We ordered the calamansi drink, the mule and dirty martini. Soooo delicious. We also shared a charcuterie board along with their pork rinds instead of bread. We ordered the ribeye cap to share and it was cooked perfectly. It had the right amount of spice and Korean flavors. The second time around we ordered their pork belly nachos and another round of charcuterie board. We made sure to order the truffle cheese and ugh soooo good! Do yourself a favor and order the truffle!! Would definitely keep coming back to Culinary Dropout when in town!",

Biscuit, Cole slaw and mashed sides were excellent. Fish n Chips were hot flaky and delicious.   I think this is my favorite Sam Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurant.

Apps - for starters we had the korean brussels sprouts and the beets with goat cheese. The beets were passable, nothing very exciting, but the brussels sprouts were out of control amazing! They were perfectly crispy and tender and the sauce was incredible. I could easily get 2 orders of these and call them dinner.  Mains - We ordered the ribs and fried chicken. The ribs were cooked just how I like them, fall off the bone tender, and the bbq sauce is sooo good. The chicken was fried perfectly and was so juicy! Also it comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw and a delicious biscuit so bring your appetite with this one, it's a TON of food.  Service was great, our server was super nice and attentive.   I love that they have live music every day! We came on a Sunday, so I was bummed to hear that they only have live music on Sunday mornings, so next time we'll just have to come earlier or on another night.",

It was my first time having mussels and Culinary Dropout provided a delicious first experience with them! I also had the salmon bruschetta and the cheese plate. The cheese plate had less cheese than I expected, but I got it for a happy hour price so I'm not too upset, just wouldn't order it again. The smoked salmon bruschetta was very tasty and I would recommend it. I had their sangria, and for 4 dollars a glass I definitely feel like I got my moneys worth! It was tasty and strong. My dining partner was entertained by the paperbag special ($1.95 for a random beer in a paperbag), and was able to have 3 beers for 6 bucks which is nearly unheard of when dining out.   My only complaint was the service and that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy when I went as it was earlier in the evening on a weeknight but I wasn't able to order a few things I wanted to try (like the Korean Shrimp and Chicken on a stick) because our waitress visited maybe every 25 minutes, if not a little longer. My dining partner had to ask the runner who brought out the the mussels for another drink because our waitress was no where to be found.   I wanted to order toasted bread (to mop up the delicious mussel broth) but by the time the waitress returned it had been quite awhile and we felt like we were inconveniencing her somehow.  Service aside, the food and drinks are tasty and I highly recommend this as a happy hour stop for drinks and appetizers.",

While the salad was decent once I got enough dressing to know their was any on there, the main course was dreadful. Of the 4 of us, 3 sent back our food and the 4th found hers unappealing (and should have sent hers back).  I asked the waitress if English customers like the fish and chips. As I'm from that side of the pond myself, I am fussy about that. I was assured their English patrons love it, so that's what I ordered.  Well, they brought out 2 orders by mistake. The second one was delivered just as I bit into my first piece of fish. That was hard enough to hurt my teeth, it was so over-fried. The chips, by contrast, were soggy. So I swapped it for the second order, which was exactly the same.  In my almost 2 hours there before I went off to get some food elsewhere, the manager did not appear. Really should have, considering our experience. Apparently, after the men left, the manager did make an appearance, and not charge for the food. Not enough to change my opinion of the place.  Go here if your primary reason for going out is to drink. Maybe get the trout, which I'm assured is good. Otherwise, stay clear - at least on a Friday (and probably Saturday).",

Looks like CD's done away with their cheese and charcuterie check list and just added a cheese plate.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=bKR19j9BvpE4gSwGo-CmQA#bKR19j9BvpE4gSwGo-CmQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/culi...</a>  Not bad- enjoyed the cheese (one tiny rectangular piece) and thumb-sized serving of jam, the Marcona almonds and delicious almonds were plentiful, and the grilled asparagus were all good.   Didn't really care for the bland breadsticks, and what's with the measly serving of bread (2 tiny pieces)?  I refrained from asking for more until the very last second, and I felt like my server didn't like the request, but she recovered very fast.  Just don't give me the eye-roll and we're still friends.  Draft beers were $3, I think, and that included Four Peaks' Kilt Lifter, but that's not what I ordered.  Instead, I tried a glass of the sauvignon blanc- quite nice!  Too bad glasses of wine aren't included in the happy hour menu...  I also ordered the chopped salad, of which the bartender rattled off a list of ingredients and sounded very sure she named everything, so I asked that a couple be omitted.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=-_VmkG-T6ywOWBoVMb5Vhg#-_VmkG-T6ywOWBoVMb5Vhg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/culi...</a>  Either I missed her mentioning a specific nut (I doubt it!), or she forgot.  Was able to pick most of them off, but still managed to eat a few that were hiding between the greens.  Salad was OK, nothing spectacular.  Probably wouldn't order it again, unless I was running short on veggie servings for the day.  Coworker tried the Korean Beef on a Stick app.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=mMBaBHk1OEvp2bspuUtl5A#mMBaBHk1OEvp2bspuUtl5A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/culi...</a>  The menu didn't lie, it was one stick of Korean beef.  For $6, I thought the price was a bit too high, but my friend really enjoyed it.    Based on what we tried today, I'd say it's best to just stick with the dinner menu.  However, I am not giving up on HH, yet, and I plan to try two or three more items soon.  Note: Happy hour menu prices online needs to be updated.",

The atmosphere is great- it is actually long picnic-style tables rather than individual ones, plus an outdoor area. Our group of 6 had no trouble finding seats for lunch. We ordered a few rounds of appetizers and meals. The pretzel fondue was good, but I have to say I love it more from Brat Haus. The burratta with pears and bacon syrup was great, but I wish I would have tasted more bacon. I had the house smoked salmon which was pretty good but not great. The salmon was delicious, but I could have done without cracked pepper on the poached egg, and it was a bit messy to put the whole thing together (toast, salmon, capers/sauce, egg) into an edible combination. The onions that came with it were super strong and I pulled those off right away. That being said, there were enough other things on the menu that I might be willing to give this one another shot.",

They have flavorful and imaginative drinks but don't pick a favorite since the menu is constantly changing.  My fav things to order food wise are the pretzel fondue and the Turkey Pastrami.  The Fondue is a 100% have to order item, I haven't met a single person who doesn't love them.  The Turkey Pastrami is also a great item as it is inventive and never disappoints.  My secret suggestion is sub out the fries for mashed potatoes and gravy.    Normally I give a Sam Fox restaurant 4 or 5 stars because they go above and beyond on service but CD is one that is definitely not consistent on service.  Also Happy hour is available in the bar only which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine.",

The atmosphere is really cool, kinda loud and totally fun.   Our waitress was the cutest thing ever! She was on top of everything and a real pleasure, I don't remember her name but she had blond and pink hair and looked like a pin up model!   For starters we got the soft pretzel bites with the fondue. Seriously amazing, you will be cheating yourself if you do not order these.   For dinner I got the fried chicken with the honey  drizzle, I loved it, super crunchy! However the mashed potato's that came with were very \"gluey\", I was not a fan of that.   For dessert we had to order two because we couldn't decide between what to get, and I am glad we did! We were only going to get the peanut butter cup which was super amazing but then at the last minute I also tossed on the Carmel pudding dessert topped with the Carmel popcorn...OH MY GOD...I could eat this every day and never get tired of it!   I am currently pregnant so I couldn't sample any of the cocktails, but the menu for them looked amazing, the husband ordered the crushed Irishmen and said it was very tasty!",

For $30 you get your choice of 3 appetizers (Pretzel bread with fondue, Caesar salad, French onion soup), 4 entrees (Ribs, fried chicken, salmon, sweet corn cannelloni), and various desserts (Salted caramel custard, apple monkey bread, chocolate toffee tart).  A mug of beer on tap or a paper-bag beer is also included in your $30, which makes it a great deal!  I had the pretzel bread with cheese fondue, which was a sizable portion, with soft, salted bread and smooth, tasty cheese.  Another person had ordered the Caesar salad, which was decent, but nothing extraordinary.  For the main course I had the salmon, which was decent.  It was cooked well, very tender, and it was served with apples, fennel, and some sweet glazed wheatberries.  For me, it was a tad too sweet due to the apples and sweet wheatberries, and the portion was small compared to the normal price of the meal ($20).  I tried the ribs which were nice and tender, and the chicken, which kind of reminded me of KFC original recipe, except with better quality, more tender chicken.  For dessert we shared some apple monkey bread and the chocolate toffee tart.  Both were delicious.  I think if I were paying full price for all these items, it would be a 3 star experience for me.  Since we got so much for $30, it was definitely worth trying this restaurant out for restaurant week.  Would I go here again?  I would probably go here to try out their happy hour, or maybe to get a light meal and also try some of their interesting sounding cocktails.",

First, what everyone says is True, get the pretzels. The pretzel bites on their own are well made, and when you throw in the provolone fondue, they're just stellar. I could have eaten these for a meal and been happy. Our group had already done happy hour snacks before hand, so I stuck to a side salad for my main course; I needed some greens after loading up on pretzels and cheese.  There's not much you can say about a side salad, all the ingredients were fresh and the buttermilk ranch dressing had such a tang that it blew my mind. I also had a specialty cocktail made with blueberry moonshine and cucumber, that shouldn't have worked, but it did.   Our server was friendly and the right amount of attentive. There was a guitarist at the perfect sound level. I thought this place had good food, and really excelled at the details to bring it to that next level.",

Well deserved James Beard nomination  This place has such a great vibe. Came here on a Saturday for an early dinner. Walked in and there was a 20 min break so we went to the bar to have some drinks. The bartenders are amazing here, they really  know their stuff. I ordered a drink off the menu, can't remember what it was called. But it was tasty. My friend asked the bartender to make him anything. It was great! Whatever it was.  Overall great. We did the cheese/charcuterie board,  then split the bistro steak, no dessert.  Great solid meal. Love the way you can mix and match the cheese/meat plate. The meat was perfectly cooked medium rare and well seasoned.   I'm definitely making this place one of my go-to's",

Located in a prime spot near the Waterfront and Fashion Square, it ends up being a place where people want be seen.  Look at Meeeeeee!  The interior is a large dark open space. This is good for finding the people you are supposed to be meeting, but bad in that the acoustics are not the best. Depending upon where you sit, even before the live music starts this place gets loud. Very loud. Huh? What? Yeah, I said LOUD!   The menu contains an assortment of comfort food as well as some pretty creative sounding cocktails. Feeling brave? You can even get a 'paper bag special' beer for $1.95 that could be pretty much anything.   Our group of 8 started with appetizers:  Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue ($10) - these are puffy balls of soft pretzel bread served with a pot of cheese for dipping. While I love my cheese probably more than almost anything, this reminded me of melted American cheese slices. I think a spicier or sharper cheese would have been better.   House Potato Chips with Famous Onion Dip ($6) - I love fresh potato chips but these were really, really greasy. The 'famous' dip (who decides that, by the way?) was just OK.   Crusty Bread with Good Olive Oil ($2) - basically what it says - slices of bread with a small bowl of olive oil.   I had the Roasted Chicken Salad, with sour apples, pistachio and dolce gorgonzola ($12). While this was fairly good, I should have asked for the dressing on the side. There was a lot in there. Probably enough for two salads, so the lettuce quickly became squishy. The chicken portion was pretty small but I did enjoy the overall flavor of the crisp apples and crunchy pistachios and cheese.   Our waiter was great, but the runner who brought out our food was clueless. She didn't seem to care that she was just putting items in front of the wrong person, and we all had to shift the dishes around ourselves to get to what we had ordered. She also carried the salad bowls with her thumb inside of them, touching the food! Ick...   I think this place could be fun for drinks or happy hour (day-drinking, anyone, when it is cool enough for the patio??) but the food was just average.  I would rather wander next door to Wildfish...",

Since I was staying at the W hotel I would pass by this restaurant and thought I'd give it a shot since it seemed like a pretty good place.  I love the fact that this place has a vintage feel; from the tables, chairs, and even the restroom.   I decided to get the fried chicken since it just sounded delicious. I ordered the pretzel and cheese fondue as an appetizer and some grilled asparagus. The fried chicken was amazing, comes with 3 pieces with 2 biscuits. The biscuits has some honey drizzled as well as the chicken. Totally a must try! The pretzel and cheese fondue was ehh A-O-K not the best. The grilled asparagus was delicious as well.",

Culinary Dropout is one of them. The experience is always positive, the food is typically satisfactory and the drinks hit the spot.  The decor at this location is rustic, contemporary and lovely at the same time with a wide open space laced with wood accents. Live music is a nice touch and makes for a decent ambient sound when enjoying drinks with your party. I have really enjoyed the cocktails I've ordered here, which gives me confidence in their bartenders. Happy hour is great time to go with lower prices and decent options. Although I wasn't thrilled with the grill cheese sliders and their rubbery faux-american cheese aftertaste, but the salad of the day hit the spot. I've also had the burrata which was a True indulgence down to the last bite.  The staff has always been very friendly here whether it's behind the bar or table service. Even I have to admit this Fox concept is executed perfectly and is in my stand-by Old Town rotation.",

Me and the boyfriend also came here to eat and drink while visiting a friend in Scottsdale. For appetizers we ordered the potato chips and mussels which were both good. It wasn't until we finished off the food before I realized everyone around us ordered the pretzel fondue...oops!  Next time that'll be on the to-do list!  Needless to say we filled our bellies with drinks and finished off our night with some ooey gooey apple monkey bread :)",

Since then I have tried a decent amount of items on the menu. I have NEVER been disappointed.   Meatloaf: the thing everyone hates when their parent's tell them it's what's for dinner. Not the case if you've ever ordered Ma? The Meatloaf! at CD. The meatloaf has got to be the thing I order most frequently. It's moist and is served with Mashed potatoes and greens. I am in love.   Aside from my love affair with the meatloaf, I could ramble on all day about all of the other amazing dishes Culinary Dropout has to offer. (Especially those pretzels with fondue).   The aesthetics of the restaurant are incredible as well. I love the big chandeliers with the eclectic furniture all while being mixed with a wooden-topped bar. It's absolutely gorgeous and perfect for a date, hanging out with friends & family, or even a business meeting. The best part is their dress code is casual.   The wait-staff is always pleasant. Always willing to suggest entrees to new guests (like my parents just the other night) and are very attentive. I like the fact that they can pretty much wear whatever they want to wear to work in as well.   I have to say, I am not surprised at the quality and perfection that goes into this restaurant, considering Fox Concepts has always hit home runs with my taste buds.",

The kitchen thoughtfully split our kale salad  (which was tasty with the sweet potatoes & asparagus and tahini vinaigrette) but we had to wait around for our server to get side plates for our ribs.  Ribs were really good. The caramelized molasses and the flavors of the rub were infused into the meat. The fries were crisp but the coleslaw was soggy and tasted old.

Server was good but it literally took an hour for our food to arrive and no apology by management even though server said manager would come out to discuss. For me the food was just ok. I was actually really disappointed. We ordered the build your own charcuterie board and the items were very small and not great. Pimento cheese was really weird smooth paste, 2 very very small pieces of manchego cheese, fried pork rinds literally taken out of a grocery store bag. Hubby had a burger and it was really good.",

Some quick searching led us to Culinary Dropout because it was one of the only places open after 9pm.   Y'all. This place was great. The decor is warm and cozy, the chairs are comfortable, and the service was A+. My favorite part was that there were TVs and music and conversations happening, but none of it felt overwhelming. We were sat at a table with big squishy chairs by the window and able to talk without shouting.   Sydney was our server and she was a delight. She was knowledgeable of the menu, cheerful and super helpful. We ordered from the build your own charcuterie board option to start with, which was the perfect sized starter snack. For entrees I ordered the sweet corn ravioli with shrimp and he got the meatloaf and oh my god. Again, amazing portion sizes. Perfect.   While I'm not eager to go back to the area for work, I'm definitely eager to get back to Culinary Dropout asap.",

They had a live band/singer who was great - he even sang a song by Robyn which is extremely rare!  For the food, I have to say, we ordered a lot and each food item was unbelievable!! I am looking forward to coming here again during a future visit.  The food was priced very reasonable and the location was convenient.

The deviled eggs had a flavorful center, not bland but not over-spiced either. Potato chips were crunchy and well-seasoned, complimented perfectly with the creamy onion dip. Both items tasted super fresh. For entrees, my friend and I did the shrimp caesar, while our other friend did the ribs. His ribs seemed pretty good (though I did not actually try them), but the salads were so bland. Just completely plain. It was literally lettuce (kale/romaine blend), shrimp, and a bit of lemon/cheese. So not worth $13. The shrimp was small and fishy tasting, and not very crispy. Just overbreaded and bland, bland, bland. I'm hoping this was just a total miss on ordering, because the atmosphere in here is pretty fun, and the apps we got were great. I'd try it again, but just be warned about choosing your order wisely - check out the Yelp pics first to see if it looks good and if others liked it. You've been warned! ;)",

It's a small plate ($4), perfect for 2 (or just for me because goat cheese is my absolute favorite). The goat cheese is topped with fresh mint and it was divine. Next I went for the nachos, as one does after eating healthy haha, and it was a huge serving ($13)! Definitely good for 3-4 people to share. The pork belly was tasty, and the chips not soggy. Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu and some cocktails.",

Thought he was in Alabama-- and so would someone from Mobile or Selma. Mmmm.   My turkey pastrami sandwich was good. The only negative was Yesterday's Soup-- French Onion is one that probably doesn't hold up well the next day: the cheese shrinks up and the bread underneath is too soggy.

Unfortunately, Fox concept group, who owns Culinary Dropout got bought out by The Cheesecake Factory a few weeks ago.  The food quality & quantity has already plummeted.  The pork belly nachos used to be covered with pork belly.  Now see them in the picture below. 1 tiny scoop of pork belly off to the side.  Frankie was great and brought us out a side of pork belly, but really?   The Korean style rib eye cap on the right side of the picture was delicious, but seems much smaller then before.   The Pink Cadillac Margarita was very good & perfect for the summer.   So go here for the Margaritas & great service from Frankie, but go somewhere else for dinner.",

    "text": "Since it was Easter Sunday, many places were overwhelmed with customers. Culinary Dropout was no exception. Luckily, we had made a reservation and were promptly seated upon checking in with the hostess. The interior of this place is really nice. I enjoyed being in the space, especially sitting on the couch, even though the family sitting next to us had an obnoxious kid that kept kicking the couch. On second thought, I'll avoid sitting on the couch next time.   I had an amazing Southwest Breakfast Bowl that consisted of scrambled egg whites, refried black beans, avocado, roasted zucchini, red pepper, chipotle yogurt, pumpkin seed, and pico de gallo. Because I like some sort of meat, I had them add sausage which was an added up charge. The bowl was pretty good. If you are vegan or vegetarian, this place has a myriad of choices for you.",

    "text": "Getting the pretzels and fondue as an appetizer is a must when going to Culinary Dropout! One order of them feeds 4 people comfortably and you still have leftover cheese to dip your fries in after. This time I ordered the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich to share and it was pretty good. I felt like the actual pastrami could have used a lot more flavor because it was rather bland so I ended up using some green pepper cholula to spice it up a bit. They give you a lot of French Fries on the side which are rally crispy (just how I like them) and they were delicious! It was my friend's birthday and they surprised her with a free dessert which was a very nice touch.",

    "text": "My friend and I were starving after shopping at the mall and had noticed there was a restaurant part of the FRC located within walking distance so we decided to check it out since it was our first time at Culinary Dropout.   Our server started off real friendly. She recommended the starred menu items since those are the classic favorites. I decided to go with one of those items and opted for their fried chicken. My friend ordered a burger and we also ordered some items for our charcuterie board as well as 2 bloody Mary's.   Everything we ordered on our charcuterie board was excellent. Our entree was another story, as well as the progression of our service. The restaurant did get busier from the time we sat down until the time we got our food. We could not track down our server and she did not check on us once so I couldn't even ask for hot sauce. My fried chicken tasted burnt for the most part and the most enjoyable part of my dinner was the mashed potatoes. I ended up boxing the chicken up and taking it home to my dog. Pricey for $18  My friend must have felt the same about the burger she ordered because she only ate her fries and a couple bites of her burger and it was untouched afterwards   3 stars all in all",

Some of the best I've had. I wasn't too crazy about their modern take on their Old Fashioned. Too heavy on the bitters .  My steak salad was eh - just ok - awash in too much what was supposed to Be bleu cheese but seemed more Caesar like. The steak stripes were tasty and cooked as requested,  The best surprise was their fried chicken - some of the best I've had. My grandson couldn't finish his do I snagged a breast and I'm glad I did. According to my wife, the coke slaw and smashed red potatoes were excellent as well. I guess I know what I'm ordering next time.  Mr. Yankeelawdog loved her kale salad  which is not something that's in restaurant food rotation but I suppose someone had to eat it.  Anyway this is a decent enough place with friendly and attentive young employees. Nothing special inside - kind of dated and plain but maybe that's the look they're going for.   I'd probably go back but not on my Top 10 Scottsdale eateries - maybe No . 13 or even 15.  It was our 3rd choice after the others couldn't accommodate our large party.",

In the heart of downtown Scottsdale, is a section of restaurants and I definitely enjoy something different from the familiar restaurant chains that I have in Florida! I had started my meal with one of their signature cocktails, and it was a beverage that I had order about four to six times during my meal, don't judge me! It was their Smashed Irishman, it was made up of Jameson, honey, Guinness redux, and mint. Let me tell you, this drink was GOOD! So good that, half of the table ordered it!   My main entree was the fried chicken, and it came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and gravy, oh and the fried chicken was drizzled with honey! I thought I was the only one who did it, but was happy to see that a restaurant does! The meal was delicious! The portions are pretty good as well.  This place is huge with indoor, outdoor and bar seating. The bar is pretty big as it is also shared outside. There was a stage near me too, so I'm assuming there are live performances here on some nights, so I'm wondering if they make room for a dance floor? If I were to ever visit Scottsdale again, I'm definitely coming back!",

I can handle a slow and relaxing dinner, but it's really frustrating to wait 45 minutes to get a drink. Our appetizers, drinks and entrees were all brought out at the same time which made for an unenjoyable dining experience.  Our food was also not good. My steak tacos were really wet (I've never called steak tacos wet before) and coated in this gross spicy sauce. All you could taste was spice and no flavor. There was also lumpy parmesan cheese all over the tacos and the accompanying slaw salad. That also tasted just like weird spice with no flavor. My husband's ribs were lacking flavor, and the side of fries were lumpy and cold. The best part of the meal was our the manchego cheese and salami from the make your own appetizer board.  This review would have been 2 stars, but there was a great live band rocking out and playing all sorts of fun covers. And despite the slow service, our server was super sweet. And they take reservations which is always a plus.  A very cool vibe for drinks and music, but not for food. I will not be returning.",

The Bob Marley painted wall was a nice touch as well.   We ordered the pork belly nachos, deviled eggs and pretzels with fondue to start. The pork belly nachos were different, loaded with porky belly, guacamole etc it was probably my favorite app. The deviled eggs were amazing and not too much, just the right mix of mayo and yolk. The fondue I wasn't too impressed with, simply melted cheese over a light but the pretzel bites were fluffy and thick.  I really wanted to try yesterday's soup as I heard it was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>, instead I ordered butternut squash ravioli with salmon. The salmon was a great touch, pretty big piece and it was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Loaded butternut squash inside the raviolis with greens, easily my favorite ravioli thus far. My co worker said not to order the chicken with it, as it's pretty dry.",

The au jus dip for the prime rib was very good. I usually don't like prime rib because its too bloody but this was cooked to perfection and was still very moist. I enjoyed this sandwich very much. The Italian grinder was delicious also, good quality meats and the dressing was perfect, not too sweet. We were too full to try desert.

The pretzels were good but the cheese fondu it came with tasted really strange to me. I was not near as impressed as the other Yelp reviewers with this particular dish.   Dinner was a bit better. We waited about 45 minutes for a table but once we ordered our food it came out in less than 10 minutes. I tried the fried chicken, which was generous in size and cooked perfectly. However, the mashed potatoes were standard and the biscuits were dry and flavorless.  I will say the staff was very nice and extremely helpful. Also, the cover band that was playing when I left was pretty damn good. I also thought the decor was interesting and well done.  Overall, I would say the food is ok but I feel it's more about the Scottsdale scene than anything else. If that is your thing, you will enjoy it.",

We had an assortment of cheeses (highlights were the manchego cheese and the olives) roasted peppers and tomatoes, and it came with bread.

The only thing I could to improve this was to put actual brussels sprouts, not just some leaves, into this dish - otherwise it was perfection on a plate.  If I could I would have picked up and licked my plate clean - the sauce it's in was so good.    Almost forgot - I ordered a strawberry with basil martini which was also very good. Apparently the bartenders are award winning mixologists.    The downside for us was our server was really bad. He was nice and friendly, but I don't think he knew what he was doing and seemed to disappear for long periods.  At one point he came back to our table to explain that he brought the wrong drink for someone at our table. Who by the way was drinking it without complaining.  The waiter sat down the correct drink and then nervously apologized, and said \"I'm sorry, but I have to take this\" and took the half consumed \"wrong\" drink.    But, the food was so good that I just don't care - and am eagerly awaiting my next trip to Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Nestled into a posh shopping district of Scottsdale Culinary Dropout offers a little flair to the upper crust. A variety of hand crafted cocktails are available and are only $10 each if my memory serves me correctly.   It was a Saturday night and I arrive with my party of three after eight pm. We waited in a VERY packed bar area for over an hour. Once seated it was pretty nice.   It was a celebratory dinner and we tried almost all the appetizers. The cheese and meat selection are particularly impressive. I'm a cheese fan and CD does  has an excellent selection. The pretzels and cheese where also a good app to share among hungry friends who had been drinking at the bar for more than an hour before dinner.  It was a nice place. I'd err on the side of saying it was a little to \"Ed Hardy\" for my taste with patrons trying to look \"rock-n-roll\", but that's the vibe and you know that going in.   Good food, good time. Minus the long wait.",

There was a wait which I didn't mind seeing as it was a Saturday night in Scottsdale. After we out our names on the list my boyfriend went to the bar to get drinks. The bartender didn't say more than 2 words to my boyfriend and just stared at him as if he was wasting his time. My boyfriend asked the guy what they had on tap and the rude reply given was \"beer\" as the bartender walked away. After throwing a menu at my boyfriend he stood there not saying a word. We ordered drinks and my boyfriend asked how much he owed and the rude bartender said \"'more than 5 less than ten, but I'll print you a receipt since you can't seem to figure it out\". We paid and walked away. It was by far the rudest behavior I have ever had from a bartender.  Our server was ok, but the wait was not worth the first impression of the night and the mediocre food.",

It was a wednesday night and my dad called to make a reservation the lady said they don't take reservations unless there are six in the party. My dad explained to them we were celebrating a birthday and wanted to make sure we wouldn't have to waot long she said it would be no problem tonight maybe a five minute wait. We arrived explained that we called and what was going on and the lady said there would be a 45 minute wait. Great. I knew this was gonna happen. Your located in old town scottsdale you should take reservations for parties of four or more.  The girl behind the hostess stand acted like she couldn't arrange something so went and got what seemed to be the manager who tried to help us out. Over all the food was fine drinks were okay but not a place I would go again for a special occasion",

    "text": "My friend celebrated her birthday here yesterday evening. We were the first three of about 15 people to show up. The server was really inconsistent and scatterbrained. As soon as we were seated, she asked us if we were ready to order drinks. After telling her we needed some time, she came back two minutes later to ask again. We asked for a HH menu and she came back several minutes later with one. Errrr.. OK, I guess the 3 of us can share... not that big of a deal I suppose.   10 minutes later, she came back and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. While waiting for our orders, more people started to trickle in. By the time she came back to our table, there were about 10+ people passing around 1 happy hour menu. Either that was the only copy in the whole restaurant or she didn't want us to order from it because as soon as someone set it down, she snatched it up and took off w/ it. WTH!?   While everyone was laughing about it and asking \"did that really just happen?!\" our food arrived. My friend & I shared the pork belly cubano and chicken fingers. Both were OK, but they should have just named the pork belly cubano a ham cubano because the piece of pork belly was no larger than 2 fingers. A total disappointment because I was looking forward to the pork belly the most! As for our drinks, she was OK if we flagged her down to take our (alcoholic) drink orders, but she was really scatterbrained when it came to refilling our waters! I asked several times for a refill, but she would walk away after refilling other people's half full glasses and ignore my completely empty glass. She did this to a few other people too that asked for water.  There were a few other servers that were helping her out w/ our table. When they brought out the orders, they would just drop off the plates wherever they felt like. Sometimes they would drop it off at one end of the table, sometimes in the middle, sometimes at the other end. Never once did they ask who it belonged to. When one dish was brought to my friend, she gave him a puzzled look and he started to walk away. She said \"I guess I can figure out who this belongs to..\" and he came back and said \"well I guess I can do it if you don't want to...\" WTF. Isn't it his JOB to?!?   My friend said she had a very similar experience last time too. Needless to say, I won't be back. Such a shame since I work right across the street and my co-workers and I eat out almost everyday.",

Had a good variety of drinks and food and their specialty house drinks were what we tried and they were good. Had the provolone fondue with pretzel bites, which were absolutely delicious. Perfect combo. The entrees are a lot of common foods, the only reason I did not give four stars since a lot of it were things you could get at a lot of places, they just had their own twist on it. We had the ribs, and the honey fried chicken. Both were good, but again  both common plates you can get a lot of places. Had dessert which was really good, recommend checking that out. Not a very expensive meal, good place to stop in and enjoy some drinks and apps.",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is one of those places that just doesn't live up to the expectations that it sets. From the outside, one would imagine that it's probably a pub-type place. Lots of bar food, great happy hour, etc. It's even super dark on the inside with dark woods, black chandeliers and a stage for a band, giving it a Scottsdale chic, but semi-dive type of feel. But the menu just leaves me scratching my head wondering where the heck it came from.  For starters, the appetizer list is relatively short and un-appetizer like, especially for a place that seems to be paying homage to bar food. Note: French onion soup should not and does not qualify as an appetizer, nor does \"Yesterday's Soup.\" Other options included oysters and mussels--two other dishes that seem out of place for the \"pub\" disguise. There was a long list of cheeses and meats, but that also seemed out of place for a pub. Perhaps I'd appreciate that selection had I been at a wine bar?  Alas, I was able to find two items on the menu that seemed to correlate with the atmosphere--pretzels and fish & chips. The soft pretzels and provolone fondue appetizer is very delicious, as you'd expect any bread and cheese combination to be. The pretzels were small, soft bites and the fondue reminded me of Velveeta, but less salty. The fish & chips, were was pretty much exactly what you'd expect for fish & chips out at a pub. Thin cut fries, cole slaw, tartar sause, crispy fish fillets. Nothing special, but not bad.  Frankly, I don't understand why the place is so dang popular. It was packed with Scottsdale nightlife, so it makes me wonder if most people come for the bar and to say that they're partying at the Scottsdale \"Waterfront.\" I probably wouldn't go back there, unless I had a real hankering for some pretzels and cheese.",

The cheap white cloth napkins kept shedding little white bits all over our clothes.  Too weird.    Warning--this is not the place to have a romantic date, deep conversation, or even a relaxing meal; the music was quite loud, plus we were seated right next to the kitchen and continually heard orders being shouted.  There was also a shrieking baby that was way worse than all the other noises combined, but I imagine this occurrence is rare on a Saturday evening.",

When 5th and Wine dared to close over Memorial weekend, my friend and fellow Yelper, Christina P, suggested CD as an alternative.  Trying to grasp onto those last few days of tolerable temps, we sat outside, and drink orders were taken promptly.  I went with the Camelback Cooler.  I wanted to love it, but it was a miss for me.  I wanted it to be a little sweeter and more \"orangey.\"  Instead, it was on the bitter side.  Cocktail number two was the Clown Punch.  This was the hit for me.  The pomegranate foam on top was unexpected, well not really since it's listed on the menu, and fun!  We all shared the soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  I could try everything on their menu, and I'm pretty sure that would still be a favorite for me.  But who doesn't love bread and cheese?  I also tried the pork belly cubano, although Christina forewarned me it's really ham, not pork belly.  Maybe that's why the restaurant is called \"Culinary Dropout.\"  Whatever the hell it was, it was really good, too.  Although the Scottsdale \"Waterfront\" is not necessarily my favorite place to be, I can see myself enjoying CD every now and then.  I can also see that 4th star with another try.",

While the portion sizes are large, you'll be lucky if you can finish your leftovers, since the food is mediocre at best. Happy hour prices are good, but the menu is unclear about which drinks are discounted. Staff and/or the menu should make happy hour pricing more clear- on multiple occasions, I have ordered a drink thinking it was well priced, only to be charged full price when my bill comes.  Really spoils the experience...and it seems obvious that someone coming during happy hour is probably there to take advantage of happy hour pricing. Regular pricing is high considering the quality of food. And while the atmosphere is young and fun, service is consistently terrible; expect to be double charged for something at least 60% of the time, and unattended to by your server the remaining 40% of the time.",

    "text": "I'm late to the Culinary Dropout party... really late!  But better late than never.  I'm not really sure why it took me so long to head to CD, especially considering I live and work within a half mile, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my first meal here.  (Thanks Todd F suggesting we dine here, and for forcing me into sharing the soft pretzels with provolone fondue app).  Speaking of, do not miss the soft pretzels with provolone fondue... it's worth the extra calories for the fluffy, cheesy, heavenly goodness!  I'm already dreaming of returning to have more of these!  Following our shared app, I went with the Chopped Vegetable Salad.  Considering Culinary Dropout is a Fox Restaurant Concept, I was half expecting this salad to be the same as the one they serve at Sauce.  Afterall, the description on the menu is exactly the same as the Sauce version.  But it doesn't do it justice!  In addition to the \"asparagus, corn, and avocado,\" this version has artichokes, pistachios, and a sweet honey dijon vinaigrette.  I had them add shrimp to it as well, and it was incredibly fresh, delicious, and filling.  I'd totally return and order exactly the same thing since I loved it so much.  Hannah was our server and she was awesome.  She was friendly and informed us of specials right off the bat (including prices).  She also mentioned that they serve Pepsi products, which I typically find that servers neglect to tell you; especially if you're a Coke person!  Todd and I both had Arnold Palmers to drink, and Hannah (and the other CD staff) made sure we constantly had refills - I was even given a refill to go, which was much appreciated.  Overall, I had a great experience at Culinary Dropout.  It may have taken me two and half years (since they opened), but I will likely add this place to my regular lunch location and be there again soon.  Anyone up for lunch at CD tomorrow?!",

There was a very eclectic vibe to the waitstaffs style. Everything from ladies in an a nice summer dress, to a young lady practically in a bra and cut off shorts. Guys were equally eclectic. But some were FAR from professional attire, so business meetings might be better elsewhere. I gave that a 2/5. Atmosphere is nice inside and out, but with the music it was just WAY to loud. 1.5/5. We were all hollering over each others tables to talk to our company. The live music is all good, just too loud. Over all, it was decent, but will probably try some of the surrounding restaurants before we go back.",

There were a decent amount of people at the bar and about half of the tables were filled. The tables and chairs are cool and allow for some privacy in a pretty open place.  The server took our order just before happy hour ended so we got the HH prices.  The happy hour menu includes 13 items so you really can make a meal out of it if you want and they don't rip you off with mini portion sizes like some restaurants do. Like most others we could not refuse the pretzels and cheese.  Impressive presentation and very tasty. Needless to say I ate too many! We also had the pork nachos- thick chips and very tasty toppings. Drinks were a little delayed but the food was brought out unbelievably quickly. There were one or two people-other than the waiter- taking food and drinks to the tables and this really seemed to help their service. After all of the HH appys we were not very hungry so two of us shared the meatloaf and the other two had \"yesterdays soup\" which was chicken tortilla. Here is where I took off a star.  It was very salty! I could not finish mine. They had live entertainment starting just as were were leaving so I am sure it gets even livelier.",

As a table, we ordered the pretzel app with cheese fondue, and I ordered the grilled cheese sliders and fries. Sure, those are items that are tough to mess up, but I appreciate that these otherwise standard items were definitely done right. The bread of my sliders was toasted to perfection .. in addition the the cheese, there was bacon and tomatoes on each slider as well. My fiance, who has had meatloaf in probably 100+ restaurants,  really enjoyed his meat loaf entree. Service was prompt, food was great, ambience and overall prime old town Scottsdale location was an A+, oh, and drinks were never empty!   Definitely can't wait to go back and try some other items on the menu. The prices are pretty reasonable as well - another nod to my 5 star rating!",

I had the Italian salad and the meatloaf. The salad had WAY too much dressing on it. Like soaked. It was not editable. Had they gone light on the dressing it would have been okay. Now the meatloaf  was awful. I would be shocked if the mashed potatoes weren't instant potatoes. It tasted just like the ones served in grade school at lunch. Same with the gravy. And the meatloaf itself was pink throughout. It made me very nervous. And the green beans were boring. Very disappointed all around.",

Their menu is quite diverse. Sandwiches, salads, seafood, ribs. A little bit of everything. Although we didn't try them this time around, their pretzel fondue is supposed to be delicious. I had the fish & chips and was very impressed with it. It wasn't soggy or overly greasy, and the fish tasted really fresh. The fries were crispy and the coleslaw, which I gave to my Dad, he said it was some of the best he's had at a restaurant.  The restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived, but our waitress was still very attentive. Food was delivered quickly and hot. The food is on the pricey side, but it IS Scottsdale, where things aren't the cheapest. For our table of three, it was $40-some dollars. Parking can be a bit of a pain, but we lucked out and found a spot in the mall parking lot across the street.  I wish I lived in the area because I want to try the rest of their menu! I'll be sure to stop by if I'm ever in Scottsdale again.",

    "text": "Happy Hour Review:  We had a nice time at the Culinary Dropout's HH this past Friday. We arrived around four-thirty and the inside bar was pack. The hostess said the HH was limited to the bar area inside and out. Nahhhh we thought, we'll stay inside thank you very much. It was 105 degrees and the outdoor water misters were totally ineffective   I mentioned in passing that I had read about their HH on Yelp. After checking with her Manager, she came back and offered us one of the communal tables near the stage.  AMBIANCE/MOOD: The crowd was a mixture of Millennium's and Gen X'er, along with an equal number of retires.  So eclectic? The interior had that old tin and aluminum stamped walls, reminiscent of the NY in the 1930s, with a large stage.  It also has several large B&W photos from the 1960s of Janis Joplin, The Who, Roy Orbison along with a very young Boss, creating some good Karma.  MENU: All of the food is $6.00: Grilled cheese sliders; Chopped salad; yummy Korean beef on a stick (photos); Pretzels & Fondue; meatloaf sandwich; Smoked salmon bruschetta, Antipasti and much more.  All beers are $3.00 served in a 12oz mug; most wines are $6.00 and the Well cocktails are $4.00.  SERVICE: Tom our server was pretty cool and on top of things.  He worked hard at refilling our glasses and had an intimate knowledge of the menu, both HH and regular dinner.  Even though this was HH, there was a focus on the regular menu.  FOOD: Everything we tried was excellent.  The salad, Fondue and meatloaf sandwich, were all very large. While the Korean Beef on the Stick was very good though it could be larger.  But it too was delicious, and not overly spicy.  PRICES: As I mentioned the Happy Hour food prices were all $6.00. Our bill came to under $41 including taxes but not gratuities.  Enjoy!",

We went to dinner with some work colleagues. They all seemed to enjoy their meals. But mine was a little disappointing.   When we arrived my colleagues had already ordered wine and the pretzel appetizer. These were both great. I ordered the gnocchi for my entree - this was were I was disappointed. I think with some work this dish could be great. But it was -- ehh. The gnocchi (which is usually one of my favorite dishes) was a little mushy. I also did not think the sausage and mushrooms blended (taste wise) in the dish.   I would go back and give this place another shot. Just order something different.",

    "text": "The Culinary Dropout has been open 3 weeks now. I give it a 4.5.  Not 5... read to the end to find out why.     I went for lunch yesterday with a friend to check it out.  I LOVED it!  First, I must admit that because it was a beautiful day in Scottsdale my mood was happy to start with.  As we stood outside the front door admiring the patio and deciding if we wanted to go in or not, a very sweet young lady left her hostess stand inside to come out and greet us.  I like this.  She could have waited for us to come to her.  This tells me the restaurant wants business and has trained their employees well!  Right away you notice the atmosphere.  Hip and elegant with a touch of years past... hence the magnificent chandeliers that draw your eye up.  The seating has a look of baroque meets modern.  Well designed, plenty of space... you don't feel crammed into the other people around you.  We of course chose to sit outside because of the beauty of the day. It took no time at all for a very sweet and adorable waitress to greet us, get our drink orders and give us a few explanations of the house specialty, the Anti-pasta bar.  Before I get into that though... I must recommend a Pisco Sour.  Not many restaurants offer them or even know what they are...definably one of my fav's and believe me... I make them well.  The Anti-pasta bar is designed to let you pick and choose for either an  entree or an app from a wonderful choice of excellent cheeses, salumi's ( that's right... NOT salami... True lovers know the difference.) olives, marconi almonds and so much more.  Your choices are then beautifully laid out on a  plate after being hand sliced at the bar where you are encouraged to watch the artistry.  On to lunch... I chose a wonderful Smoked Chicken Salad.  They smoke their chicken right there on the sight and I have to say... it was fantastic!!  The pears that had been sweetened, the endive and the pistachios that accompanied the salad to be tossed in a fantastic vinaigrette. It was sublime!  Our meal was finished off with their famous monkey bread that came with a beautiful scoop of ice-cream.  Yes, all the way around I loved this place.  The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because I will go back and rate the bar.  This is typically the heart of an establishment and will have a lot to do to determine return customers.  Look for my review on this.  Happy eating everyone!!",

First time was like 3 star experience... decent amount of beers on tap and solid happy hour food list. The bartender was a chick who was cute and was able to shoot the shit with us pretty well, I was impressed.  The look and decor of the place is impressive and swanky, reminds me of back home in LA.   As I was ready to leave, it was pretty busy, and there was a huge group of older guys. Above average first experience.  The second time was on a Saturday a couple weeks ago and my buddies wanted to check out a cool spot for food and drinks in Scottsdale so I took them here and it ended up being a good call.  For lunch, this place is awesome as we got to sit outside on the couches, got some GREAT cocktails (not cheap though) and my Pork Belly was really good.  1st experience 3 stars, nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.  2nd experience, 5 stars, chill lunch atmosphere with good food and good drinks...  If this place was a bit cheaper I'd give it 5 stars but I will return regardless.",

We came in about an hour before closing looking for food (every restaurant's nightmare) on a Saturday. They sat us right away. Mike, our waiter, was extremely helpful. He was patient with us, answered our questions, made great recommendations, and was very friendly. Having to work a crowded place late on a Saturday night, not many people would be so nice. He even gave us a heads up to make our dessert order before the kitchen was closed. Another guy with an epic beard (sorry, didn't catch his name)who wasn't our waiter was just as helpful even though he didn't have to be. Most people would have said they would try to find our actual waiter. This guy stopped what he was doing to help and he was completely genuine (and patient with my friend's never ending questions). The food here is amazing also. I highly recommend the pretzel bites, the turkey pastrami, and my friend really liked his burger, too.  They have live music on Friday and Saturday and the band on the night we went was amazing, and very fitting for the atmosphere.  I hate to tell too many people about this gem, because I want to keep it my little secret. But there is a lot of buzz about this place and it deserves praise.",

There are many standouts, but if you could only get one thing, get the Soft Pretzles with Provolone Fondue.  They are amazing and I dream about them often.  Soft pillowy pretzle bites that are moist and amazing.  So good you can eat them plain.  But you shouldn't because the provolone fondue is super yummy.  For the entrees, I've had the Cuban Sandwich, Shaved Prime Rib Dip Sandwich, The Pub Burger, and the Gnocchi.  The cuban sandwich is made with pork belly and is amazing.  I usually ask for a little extra yellow mustard because I like my cuban to be a little more traditional.  The Pub Burger is amazing.  The Gnocchi is make with mushrooms and truffle oil and is heavy, but worth it.    The atmosphere is beautiful and all of the waiters I've had have been great.  They always make great recommendations are will take care of you.    I will keep going to Culinary Dropout on a regular basis.",

My friend and I had dinner here on Saturday night for her going-away farewell. We were told by the hostess that the wait would be 5-10 minutes. I ordered a Home-EC martini while we waited, and it was okay. I love basil, but I'm not sure if I could get used to it in my drinks. The size of the drink for the price was a bit disappointing as well.   For an appetizer, we ordered the soft pretzel and it was amazing!! The provolone fondue with the soft, warm pretzels were so delicious! My friend and I were really surprised, and impressed. The chicken tortilla soup was also really good. There were small chunks of tomatoes in the soup that had just enough spiciness. After two impressive starters, I was excited for my coq au vin, but I was actually really disappointed. The sauce was way too sweet for my liking. The vegetables and chicken were cooked well, but it was pretty difficult to put down the sauce.   Although we waited much longer than 5-1o minutes for our table, the service here was pretty good.",

We ordered the soft pretzels with provolone fondue to start, and it was a great appetizer, but it was pretty filling, so less orders go farther (we ordered 2).  For the actual meal I ordered the mussels at the advice of the waitress, and I was severely disappointed.  Mussels are one of my favorite dishes and this place just did not cut it.  They were extremely bland and the sauce they came in was absolutely tasteless.  By far the worst I've had.   On the other hand, my friends enjoyed their food and their drinks, so perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing, but it's hard to give it the four stars it would otherwise deserve when the meal I thoroughly disliked was recommended to me.",

The ambiance is vibrant, the service is excellent and the cocktail list keeps our tastebuds buzzing. We have had the good fortune to become friendly with Cara, the manager. Each time we came in she would make a point to come over and say hello. She remembered little tidbits about us and she was always very genuine.  We are sad that she has left, but we definitely plan to visit her at her new venture.   We hope the new manager will be able to fill Cara's shoes!",

    "text": "We ended up here on Saturday night and overall had a great experience!  The wait was a bit over the top, but we solved that problem and went next door for drinks.  What started out as a 15-30 minute wait ended up being almost an hour, but the meal was worth that frustration.  It's very clear that this is one of \"those\" places in Scottsdale, so I'll give it a pass.  ;)  We let our server know that we were in a rush and she was very accommodating. (We had somewhere to be after dinner.)  We had a nice bottle of red wine, had the \"make your own\" antipasti platter, the pretzel fondue, and the monkey bread.  It was awesome!    First the fondue:  I'm not a HUGE fan of cheese fondue, but I can see why people would like it.  It was good.  The pretzel that went with was good too.   The cheese/antipasti platter:  YUM.  Decent cheese selection, although they were out of one of the ones we wanted.  We had the tomatoes and one of the meats (capicola and I know I prob spelled that wrong).  So. Good!   The monkey bread:  I'm not a huge dessert person, but this was REALLY good.  One or two bites were sufficient for me...but the person I was with LOVED it.   Overall, a good experience and I def hope to be back....hopefully with a fun group friends to share some of the yummy plates with!",

    "text": "as recommended by many on Yelp we tried the soft pretzels fondue... and it was a success!  definitely need to limit yourself so you don't get too full before your meal.  the menu has a little bit of everything, but not overwhelming. the only hard thing is deciding what sounds better! we tried the pastrami sandwich and the chef salad. both are DELISH! I'm not a big pastrami person because it has a distinct taste to it, but this one was definitely an exception. it wasn't dry and it didn't have a weird after taste. it had you wanting more.  the chef salad that was recommended by our waitress & it was definitely a great choice. it wasn't the usual boring chef salad - the taste was different & the dressing didn't taste store bought.... i could be wrong....but the ingredients all together worked perfectly. the quality of the ingredients made a difference. I'm a carboholic - and the sandwich was definitely worth having, but i think the salad for me is worth having again.  we'll be back and our next objective is to tackle the fried chicken.... until next time culinary dropout, until next time....",

I highly recommend the soft pretzels with fondue, so yummy! Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I had the Sweet Corn Cannelloni; the flavors were very rich and I was happy to see they had several vegetarian options. We also got to choose a complimentary desert, and had the Monkey Bread. Sounded so-so but was delicious. Also, I love decor! Comfy chairs, that are different at every table and the gorgeous chandeliers make it feel very upscale. My only complaints would be the amount of time we waited to get our food/drinks, it was pretty loud, a bit too dark, and the portions were fairly small for the price.",

    "text": "Thank goodness someone took over what once was pink taco, aka yuck city, and turned it into something worth stopping in when in Scottsdale. Fox Concepts yet again has made a success and a place I think I will actually return to.   To start with we had a delicious plate of cheese and meats from the anti pasta menu, along side with some marinated olives and bread w/ olive oil. Just enough to get our taste buds excited and just enough to have my boyfriend (who is not into fancy smancy stuff) say \"give me some more\".  These went nicely with our beers (they've got a great list), my mother's martini (which she seemed to enjoy), and my brother's gin on the rocks (he says they carry a gin that is very rare and delicious but the name didn't stick with me-sorry).   All of our dinner plates were delicious; fried chicken w/ mashed tatters & biscuits (skin on chicken was a little on the salty side but very crunchy), salmon w/ apple and rice, grilled cheese sliders(who could mess those up?), chicken salad, prime rib dip (served with onion soup instead of au jus, yum yum), and the patato ghesicuto (pasta- I know I can't spell but it was yummy too). Around the table, everyone seemed pretty satisfied.  My only criticisms would be that we were seating just to the side of the kitchen, enough to be able to look inside. I dig places that leave it open so you can watch your foot and the chefs are aware that the client is aware of whats going on BUT I did watch one man on the end prepare countless dishes without gloves on. He went from cutting and laying out proscuitto onto creating their carmel kettle corn dessert (scooping with bare hands), to setting out what appeared to be the fondue app. Yes, there can be worse things that happen in a restaurant but as someone who has worked in food service, it made me squirm a bit. I suppose that's why it's called Culinary Dropout.  ...oh, and the music was a bit too loud for me. Great joint for out with friends on the way to the bar or I would think for happy hour but not for a family dinner (my Grandma had to barrow a flashlight from the waitress it was so dark).",

    "text": "Having been satisfied by other Fox restaurants I was excited to hear about the opening of Culinary Dropout. So this Saturday the boyfriend and I were in Old Town and decided to check it out for dinner.  Upon walking in we were greeting promptly and sat right away (it was early). But then we sat for quite a while before anyone came over to our table. I was starting to get nervous. But our waiter finally came by and was more than attentive from that point forward.  We skipped any appetizers, but did stare longingly at the pretzel bites the table next to us ordered. Maybe next time. I ordered the Pub burger and the boyfriend ordered the gnocchi. I was glad that my burger came with fries. This was not stated on the menu anywhere which I thought was kinda weird. But whatever, yay fries!  Our food came out really fast considering they were starting to get pretty busy. My burger was cooked just right and had a nice flavor. The bacon was nice and thick, not that cheapo paper-thin bacon you get at some places. I was kinda hoping it was going to be as good as the burgers at Zinburger in Tucson (another Fox place) but it wasn't quite as tasty. Close though. The portion of fries was large. They were thin cut and were nice and crispy. The boyfriend enjoyed his gnocchi. It came with sausage and was served in a cream sauce. I had a bite and thought it was quite flavorful. Not a huge portion but gnocchi can be pretty filling so it wasn't bad.  Even though we were pretty full the waiter talked us into ordering the monkey bread for dessert. It's served in a small cast iron dish and is sort of like a cut-up cinnamon roll with apples. It came to our table bubbling hot and served with a dish of vanilla ice cream on the side. It was very rich but the apples were a nice consistency and overall the sweetness wasn't overpowering. The ice cream helped cool it down and complimented the flavors well.  I can kinda see the bar filling up with some Scottsdale douche-bags at night but at least the staff wasn't pretentious. By the time we left the lobby area was getting pretty full so I imagine if you go after 7:00pm you'll have to wait for a table. It's worth checking out though so if you're not starving, wait.",

Get a side of the bbq sauce to dip them in!

They had unique choices that were delicious. The bread was served with a cherry puree of some sort that is to die for. And the olive oil really is a find, it almost tasted like buttah.   The beer and wine list wasn't extensive but they had very nice choices.   Overall I liked it and the staff was attentive.

I don't know what they did to it but it was not what I was expecting. I don't know about you but when I order a french onion soup, I expect salty, beef brothy, oniony, cheesy, and hot. Not sweet..and weird. I do have to say, the server could tell I was trying to eat it, and took it off the tab! Very nice. Half of the table ordered the meatloaf. Random thing to want to order, but it was absolutely delicious. I scarfed the entire plate and was ready to lick it.",

The place has a cool, unique decor. Kind of punk-like with a smattering of glam. Anyhow, the waitress came over and we had a bit of a problem ordering drinks. Well i didnt, but Mandy did since they were out of/did not carry a few of the options Mandy was looking into. The waitress went as far as to say \"I feel like I am dissapointing you over and over.\" Yikes.   I ordered the Gnocci, and Mandy got the French Dip. My Gnocci was just okay, nothing spectacular. Mandy said her French Dip was to die for. Next time I go in I fully intend on trying their meat/cheese menu, it looks like they have quite a selection.

A live band plays a few days a week so tune in for that. And plan for a late night :)  I think since it just opened in January, they are working kinks out so bear with some of the service \"issues.\" The company I've been with, the several times I've already dined there, have kept me completely engaged so I don't think I've had to wait long.

Mostly because, while I adore most of their concepts, I have found the quality of their food to be uneven at best.   The first time I ate at C.D. I was certain that this was the place that would change my mind. Amazing burger. Superb even. I didn't even mind the fact that it was giant-sized. Ate half and enjoyed every minute of it. Fun drink list. Good apps. Cute, eager server. All in all, a great introduction.  Then, the second time. A salad. Lacking variety of texture and totally overdressed (and not in the \"didn't she know it was casual Friday\" sort of way...). The server was trying really hard but it seemed like everyone was stretched just a little thin.  So, we are back to \"uneven\"...  Overall, I think I would come here again. I really want to try it for dinner. And it is way better than the Pink Taco, which inhabited the space before. The food has potential and there are still several things on the menu that I haven't tried that sound good.",

This is why I love AZ in the summer.  I love the decor of the place.  It is real open and airy (at least when they have all the doors open), they have nice big tables and comfortable seating.  The decorations are interesting as well.  The whole place has a great vibe to it.  I just don't like it that they play the music a bit too loud.  Though I didn't have any, they have a pretty impressive and reasonably priced beer/wine/interesting cocktail menu.  They have a big list of real random cocktails that I would like to come back and sample.  The Food:  * House Potato Chips = excellent. a bit too salty though.  I have no idea why the onion dip is famous; it is pretty good but nothing that you couldn't get out of a can. * Soft Pretzels & Fondu = very good and exactly what you would expect....pretzels and melted cheese.  Nothing fancy. *Artichoke Salad = very interesting and pretty good. * Kurobuta Pork Ribs = excellent. very very tender and very very tasty.  this dish really doesn't jive with the rest of the menu but whatever...I ordered it anyway to go against the grain of my party.  The fries and cole slaw that come with are not very good. * Ricotta Gnocchi = very interesting and pretty good.  This place is very interesting to say the least thus the name I guess.  I'm not sure I would rush back but it was very good and the service was great.",

Saw five cars in a massive parking lot that probably holds 50 spots.    Then, I see a sign that says valet only.    Asked to self park- was told to park on the street.     Typical trash restaurant that's just a marketing company that sells food.  Who pays for a valet with no customers in sight?  Serious question.   I parked (and ate) elsewhere.",

My family and I came here for lunch on our annual trip to Arizona for the holidays. We were 5 women and sat at the cutest round table (my fav because you can see everyone) in fun, different arm chairs. The atmosphere is really chiq and lively.  We started off with the soft pretzels served with provolone cheese. I never knew melted provolone cheese could be so delicious, but it is! I think my cousin and I enjoyed this the most and probably ate the most because it is that good! As my lunch, I had the grilled cheese sliders. It was the perfect blend of cheese with bacon.  Culinary Dropout is a must try when in the Scottsdale area. I cannot wait to go back and try something else from their electic menu.",

The food was great as expected,  the service was ok,  had to ask for silverware,  short changed $1 on payment.  My biggest issue and probably the reason I will not return is that towards the end of the night they begin cleaning the floors,  using cell phone flashlights to illuminate the floor, it was so distracting and rude. Here we are trying to enjoy the evening and we have bright flashlights surrounding us.  I have never experienced anything like it.",

All of the items had something wrong with the order. The fries were over cooked. They forgot the cheese and bacon on my burger. They still put the dressing on the MAC burger even though we asked for it on the side. They dropped the last of the tuna on the floor so they had to sub shrimp on the salad (after coming to us to talk about the situation), but the shrimp's texture was weird and it didn't go well with the salad.   Needless to say, the food was not impressive. The ambience was nice and the outside seating was amazing.",

We sat outside in large armchairs with a lower table. We weren't very hungry so we split the pretzel fondue appetizer and the Gorgonzola chicken salad. The salad was really good and awesome that they split it for us. But the pretzels were just okay, I am not quite sure why they are so popular. In my opinion the individual pretzel bites are too big, 3 bites, and they definitely needed the cheese for dipping. We did have a great server! All and all a fun place that would be a great date night but we did see a couple children in the restaurant at 8pm.",

Again, I go to the Phoenix location pretty regularly, so I'd like to think my last experience was just an exception and not the rule.  This time, our waitress, Addy, was so sweet and attentive, it was like a one eighty from my first experience.  The food and drinks, were definitely on point, too. I ordered the Drunken Panda, whose calamansi reminded me of childhood drinks with my mom, and I later found out was sourced by vomFASS, a cool food shop around the corner.  We also ordered the Thai Chile chicken wings, which were amazing, they reminded me a little of flavors I would find at a fusion restaurant and was a welcoming twist to regular hot wings.  The meatloaf sandwich was just OK, their meatloaf is better as a standalone dish.The sandwich itself just ended up being a mushy mess of loaf and cheese. For our entrees we ordered the trout, and the fish and chips. Both were cooked well and tasted great. The coleslaw also complimented the fish and chips quite nicely.  Overall, I'm glad I came back and gave them a second chance; this is the type of experience that's made me a returning customer to the Culinary Dropout Phoenix location, it's nice to know Scottsdale can provide a similar experience, too.",

Given the fact that we had a party of 30, my expectations were that of chaos. It couldn't have gone any smoother. The sampling of appetizers were all delicious. On the basic side, hot pretzel balls dipped in a very mild fondue appealed to everyone, the hummus was unique and fresh, while the wings blended a complex array of flavors any foodie would enjoy. Fried chicken and 36 hour smoked ribs top the comfort food list if that's your mood, or dive deeper into the menu for something more exotic. Top it all off with live music and great cocktails for a truly enjoyable evening. Give this place a try",

The hostess was salty and a little snobby. She seated us fairly quickly as our table had already been setup for us which was good. We sat down and waited 7-8 minutes. No one ever came over to us and it looked like a manager was training a new hostess at the table next to us.  She obviously wasn't aware of what was going on nor did she seem to care. I know she saw us sit down. My husband finally got up to ask for help. He sat back down and we waited another few minutes before getting up to leave. As we were getting up, of course the waiter comes over.  We told him we had waited almost 10 minutes without as much as a hello and were headed elsewhere. His indifferent response was \"oh ok\"and turned around and walked off.  Appalling! TERRIBLE SERVICE. POOR MANAGEMENT.  I gave the place 2 stars because the vibe was great and I'm sure the drinks and food were probably good.  We wouldn't know. Never left a review because honestly we really are easy going but every person we encountered there was rude.",

Maybe I'm being a little snobby, but it is still hard for me to get over that it is located in a mall.   My other half got the paper bag beer which is $2 and was probably the best part. He was positive it was a Mexican beer, but it was from the good old Wisconsin (Hamms), so much for his Mexican roots. I guess they do this with shots too for $6.   I do want to come back to try some of the drinks. They have a large drink menu and they all looked super yummy.   If you are daring try Yesterday's Soup. I'm sure it is still fresh. :)",

    "text": "My stomach started to growl and my head got light headed. It could have been the weather, but most likely it must have been lunch time. Im not particularly fond of this weather, but i am fond of this place that i stumbled into.   The ambiance is different from what i am use to seeing from a restaurant. When you walk in and look up, you see massively beautiful chandeliers. I pretty much want to sing from the top of my lungs and fantasize about swinging from the chandeliers. If you don't like swinging or sitting near the chandeliers, there are other types of seating on the other side of the room. It could be at a couch, a table, or even a recliner of some sort. Whatever you feel like sitting in, it seems like this place has it all.   It was lunch time so i wasn't too sure what i was in the mood for. The only thing i knew was that i was hungry. I wanted to eat, but just how much. Whenever i don't know what to get, i wait....i wait/research what others tried and wrote about or ask the server/bartender. My choices were between the turkey pastrami, shaved prime rib dip, or fried chicken.  It was a simple logical choice after questions were asked on how i wanted to feel after the meal. Did i want something light and refreshing or heavy food coma in the heat? the happy medium was the shaved prime rib dip.   The shaved prime rib dip is something you have to come and try for yourself. The meat is tender and not dry. The bun is not on a typical french bread and not your typical dip sandwich. I guess maybe that's why the creators were cullinary dropouts. :)   A delicious sandwich that i would probably try again if i am ever back in the area.",

A small group of friends and I went to Culinary Dropout on Camelback Rd to have a nice meal and celebrate my bachelorette weekend. As always, the food was great. My friends and I split a number of small plates; the salmon, the pretzels and cheese sauce (must try!!), parmesan chips, meat and cheese board, and pork nachos. I also recommend the Room Service cocktail (gin, strawberry simple syrup, prosecco).   When we got to the restaurant the host staff was very friendly and we were seated immediately, but then it took a little while to get things going. Once they found out that my sister had called ahead and left us a bottle of champagne and prepaid half the dinner, they were much nicer to us and doted on us, but I saw other tables being annoyed by the lack of service they were receiving. I don't remember the name of our server - just that he looked a lot like Jason Mraz! He was very friendly and took whatever ridiculousness my friends and I were saying after a bottle of champagne and 2 cocktails each with a smile and a laugh. He was a great server and I hope some day to return and learn his real name! :)",

It's probably a hot spot for it but the problems were the bartenders were total a-holes.  When asked what I wanted, I said \"I think we'll have...\" only to be stopped and asked \"do you think or do you know?\"  I only got one drink in an hr period because 1 bartender spent the majority of the time cleaning mixing cups and other 2 spent the majority avoiding me probably because I was wearing a t-shirt and sandals vs. a flamingo button up shirt w salmon shorts, a vest and a fedora.",

Outdoor tables seemed not to match the rest of the decor. Cheap looking plastic tables like in some burger place. Food was good and service was fast enough. Overall nice experience but lack of professionalism/knowledge on host/staff side. Fried chicken wasn't as good as you would've expected from this type of \"high end\" restaurant. Biggest disappointment was probably too loud music inside. It's not a dance club or concert. People go to restaurants to eat and socialize not to yell over loud music in order to be heard.",

I love the overall vibe of this place and no matter the countless repeated visits to this location, I love their patio, the varying chandeliers, the comfy chairs and diversity of sizes, and just the look of the place. It's not trying hard with the cool factor. I haven't been dismayed once with bad service (yet.) and I hope never, and not once have I seen their host staff give on an upturned nose attitude. Kudos for that.   I totally recommend the pretzel bites it's yum! I've had the same bites at Arrogant Butcher and for some odd reason Culinary's is best. The baked mussels is good as well. Entree wise, I do enjoy their fish and chips, as well as their fried chicken, and no complaints of the bistro steak but seriously it's not worth more than $20. But don't miss out on the monkey bread, that's like coke, it's addictively good. =P Oh, and when they're crowded just try to avoid sitting near the stage, let's just say, head nods and smiles will be the focal point of your dinner conversation and you oughta brush up on lip reading. Overall a good place. =)",

At first, I thought it was a small portion, however it filled me up fast and was so fresh and tasty!  I also had a Double Chocolate Stout and a beer from Kona, Hawaii. Both were great and the chocolate beer had a great chocolate aftertaste. My boyfriend had the Fried Chicken and it was glazed with a delicious and sweet honey spread and was a very large meal! He had two local beers that he enjoyed. The waiter was very friendly and made great recommendations. He was fantastic!   There was also live, entertaining music. Great for a Friday night!  For dessert we shared the Apple Monkey Bread (which is cooked fresh) and served with ice cream. It was delicious! I will definitely be back!",

We ordered the Pub Burger and Shaved Prime Rib sandwich, they were both pretty good, but a little pricey for what it was ($15 for a sandwich!!).  The decor was pretty interesting, kinda dark for night time but the chandeliers were absolutely beautiful!  The staff were attentive and almost overly informative on the food (couldn't hurt right).

Waited a really long time for our server to return, my hubby had to go chase down the waiter. We finally ordered one meat, one cheese, some grilled asparagus and bread and olive oil. TONS of bread and very little of everything else. Not great or over the top ingredients - we could have done better at AJ's or Whole Foods. All in all, very poor service and more talk than walk on the food. Don't think we'll go back to try anything else as it was pricey for what we got and again, the service sukt.",

My boyfriend and I started off with the \"paper bag special\", a surprise beer that comes out in a paper bag :). I ordered the mussels and they were DELICIOUS. They came with some sausage as well as two bread sticks. It was a large portion for a good price and I was stuffed for the rest of the night! My boyfriend ordered the pastrami on a pretzel roll which I would also recommend Our bill came out to about thirty dollars, what a steal! I would come here again and again!",

The booths are also big leather couches that give off the same vibe. But it all comes together in a cool modern kind of way. The chairs are comfortable, but there's big downside. I'm short, so the table was oddly high.   Culinary dropout is also kind of small, so we waited a while to get a table, but once we ordered, the food came out ridiculously fast. But the it was really good, and the prices are pretty low (especially compared to the other places in the Waterfront/Fashion Square Mall area).   The cocktail menu is really impressive. I would definitely head back just to try the random assortment of drinks they make. Their Appetizer menu also has a lot interesting temptations.   I would recommend Culinary Dropout as a perfect happy hour spot. Hit it up sometime with your friends and coworkers on at an early time on a weekday evening.",

What's funny is that OTHER than the food (somewhat of a big deal when I go out to eat and I'm starving!) I had a great experience here.  Service was great (really great actually), we got right in and I had one of the best gin cocktails I've had in awhile.  Delish...if anything go for a few drinks and move on somewhere else for the food.  I had trout and it was worse than something I could make at home on a Tuesday night.  Which is saying a lot b/c I'm a terrible cook.  Sides were flat, small portion and just not very satisfying.  Conclusion  - great service, great drinks and fun atmosphere but terrible food.  Lots of other great places like that in Scottsdale, don't waste your time!",

    "text": "Empire building is a curious thing...there are always a bunch of supporters and camp followers at first...then the wind changes direction for a while and people begin to have their doubts about the empire.  Sometimes, actual revolution follows and heads (quite literally) roll!  I wonder what will happen to the Fox Restaurant Empire in the future?  Will there be a revolution?...will Fox launch a \"Death Star\" to destroy \"rebel\" restaurants?...will they change to become a representative restaurant democracy (electing a new leader every 4 years or so?)...or will they simply fall into decline and decay away, like the Romans?  For now, they seem to be riding tall...good for them!  Some of the Concepts are (it seems to me) more successful (in every sense) than some others...Bloom is disappointing in its execution, Modern Steak is just OK for the price, Sauce is pretty tasty and, in my opinion, Culinary Dropout is the best of the breed, so far (OK, I haven't visited all the far flung reaches of the Empire quite yet...you know the sun never sets on the Fox Empire).  The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner at CD again last evening, after dropping by Old Town Tavern to have a couple of belts, say \"hi\" to friends and watch people tuning up for the Scottsdale Culinary Festival (a Saturday afternoon debauch of the 1st order).  We have yet to have a bad meal at CD...esp. given the price points...and that always makes me happy!  Pub Burgers, Pretzel Fondue, Fish and Chips, Fried Chicken, Potato Chips (and you know I'm a sucker for fresh house made potato chips), Prime Rib Dip and rest have all been tasty, well prepared and nicely presented by very friendly and attentive wait staff!  What's not to like?  For me the answer is \"nothing\"...esp. when you add the lovely decor (it kind of reminds me of my own living room...even out on the patio), the ambiance and convivial atmosphere and the wonderfully relaxed dining experience at CD.  Last night, we took our time, enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the patio, watched people, chatted with our fellow diners and just let the warm, comfortable spring evening settle over us...in other words, the quintessential Scottsdale experience!  For that, I salute the Fox Empire...Pax Fox.",

I've had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  I'm a fan of the gnocchi, even though it's a little different than traditional gnocchi. The location is great, as long as there isn't a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while.

We frequent the Tempe location a lot, but had people in town to entertain and they were staying in Old Town. Not sure if there wasn't a manger on staff or a new waitress but it was the WORST service ever that day. The bartender looked stressed out as maybe he was all alone?  Besides the food, the service is what I end up enjoying the most at CD. Very frustrating day here and won't return to this location. As the waitress handed us the bill is when she finally  said \"sorry about all the delays\". Really? Mgmt needs to work on their staff and keep it typical of the other FOXRC locations.

Yes, it's hip, has a cool vibe going on and the food is great! The decor is funky (love the chandeliers), the wait staff is friendly and fun and I love the outdoor seating area. Perfect for a November Saturday in Scottsdale! Yes, we managed to score an outside table, even though it was 7pm on a Saturday. We started with the pretzel fondue and YUM! Wanna make it at home! I myself had the ricotta gnocchi - a delicious bowl of upscale comfort food! It had mushrooms and sausage, it was creamy and velvety and just plain good! My friends had steak, short rib pasta and salmon and one of them ordered the chocolate cake in a mason jar for dessert. How novel, but wonderfully warm and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant. I'm hoping the Fox restaurants in Tucson will compare, as I have yet to try them out.",

The first impression was it smelled like a locker room and we kept wondering why it smelled so bad. We had never been there so decided to stay and see what it was all about. Our waitress was very nice, friendly and prompt. My father-in-law and I both ordered the fried chicken, my daughter got the fish and chips and my husband ordered the ribs. My daughter's plate arrived with a hair in the fish - no it wasn't hers ( her hair was pulled back in a pony tail). The chicken was very dark - cooked way too long and tasted burnt. It was very dry. We did not return it because we figured if they served it looking like that they obviously think nothing is wrong. VERY DISAPPOINTING !! The atmosphere was dark (black and purple) and seemed like a strip joint feel. All the waitresses wear short cut offs and look sloppy. The ones with long hair do not have it pulled back (wonder where the hair in the fish came from???????) No recommendations here except for the nice waitress we had to get a job somewhere else!!  God help you if you eat here -stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

It is not that I did not like the decor, just thought they did not do enough with it. The Purple textured wall and the kitchen window needs to be lit much better, either from top or bottom. to show the detail of the panels. The rock photos are the typical black and whites that I have seen at any of a dozen places in LA over the past 15 years. Mick Jagger, Janis, Keith RIchards, yawn. If your going to use those photos on that big of a wall, at least make a bigger impact and blow them up much larger. Fox has an army of designers and management, to me they got a bit lazy with the decor.  The menu design and fonts, I have seen in quite a few places. It works very well, but come up with something original guys, Check out Red Devil Pizza on Hollywood Blvd to see what I mean. I think thats the name of the place. Anyway, I can tell you that most likely the Fox Group has been to the place. Very similar.  I would go back, but I would not run back, or go out of my way. I would say that the place will be successful because it has enough to offer, and it is a killer location. Of course that Scottsdale crowd can be very fickle.",

He seems to have a recurring pattern of great concepts with mediocre execution. The $9 grilled cheese sliders were pretty bad, with yellow American cheese like the packaged grocery store slices. For just $6, you can have a MUCH better grilled cheese sandwich at former Fox restaurant, Chloe's Corner (at Kierland Commons), and it's greater quantity, too. The $12 smoked chicken salad was quite yummy but very small. You could get equally as good salads at Chloe's Corner for $7.50. Or if you're going to spend $12, at least go across the way at Fashion Square to Grand Lux Cafe and get one that's big enough for a whole meal! The $7 salted carmel pot de creme was also just so-so. I almost NEVER leave any dessert uneaten, but this was just very one-dimensional and too sweet. I won't be rushing back here any time soon, but I'll probably be suckered in to trying some of Fox's other new places. I guess I'm just an optimist.",

When I entered the restaurant, I liked what I saw.  Good ambiance.  I put in my name and waited at the bar for my table to be ready.  The beer selection was good, we settled on the Chimay.  After 30 minutes went by, I went back to the hostess to see why we hadn't been seated.  For some reason they had crossed off my name without seating us.  Not the best start.  We got to the table and ordered the pretzel fondue appetizer.  The cheese was a little bland, but it was ok.  For a meal we split the chicken salad and pork ribs.  The chicken salad was great.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.  The pork ribs were way too sweet, had almost no meat on the bones, and the cole slaw was bland.  I would not order this again.  Overall, I would return to the restaurant for a happy hour or for drinks and a cheese plate, but probably won't be returning for dinner.",

A 50 minute wait from order to table is excessive.  The room was half full or less.   The expediter supporting the cooks repeatedly rubbed under her nose as if she had a cold or allergies and swished her long loose hair off her shoulders with her hands then touched the plates.  This poor hygiene was observed over and over during the prolonged wait time.  With the numerous other opportunities in Scottsdale I would suggest you look elsewhere.

The fondue with pretzel bites, so simple yet so scrumptious.   Their sandwiches and burgers are well made and I enjoy them. The decor is always clean, calm, cozy, and transforms to a light romantic setting at night.",

The service is very slow, our server brought us water and we literally had to wait 15 mins for straws. Same think with the drinks, asked for straws but server never brought it. I would be fine if it was busy, but it's was not that busy anyways. Now to food, this place is overrated, the food are overly priced and tastes just average. I got the ribs, which tasted just average but their salmon was great.",

Though the fried chicken was marked as a favorite, we found it to not be one of ours. The chicken was sweet instead of savory, something not mentioned in the menu. The white meat was so dry that we couldn't eat it. The nachos, though better than the chicken, was mostly cilantro. The pork was mostly fat that we had to throw away quite a few pieces, out of the very few given on the nachos.  At least the drinks we had were good.",

And I must say they lived up to all the hype I had encountered until that time.  We ordered the pretzel fondue, green chili stew and the mussels. And after we were done I saluted the kitchen. Wonderful food. Tasty, unique and a great representation of what these guys do.  The fondue was a great starter. The mussels were just superb. Not sure where they source then from, but they tasted so good. And the stew, what can I say. Couldn't stop chowing down on it.  The restaurant is well laid out and beautifully decorated.  The only weak link in the chain was inattentive service. Especially considering it was not really busy. But this is a problem that exists in many restaurants as they try to reduce operating expenses by being too aggressive in cutting staff.  Overall, I will return.",

It had such a great, chill vibe to it, live music every weekend, a great selection of wines, beers, and mixed drinks, and some great food. Got the Soiled Dove & an Old Fashion to drink-- both were DELICIOUS. Korean Style ribeye cap was better than I expected: the meat was extremely tender and juicy. The pretzels were ordered as a meal with expectations of them being bite-sized, but they were HUGE and so good. The fondue was on a heated plate with a candle under to keep it warm. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about food and drink menu & made great suggestions. Would definitely return in the future! Plus there's free parking right outside.",

Friday night,, around 6:30 we called for reservations,,  we were told 9:30pm.. as we were walking, we asked for 8pm, and the receptionist said she would put us down for 8:00.  We arrived at 8:00 and were seated within 5 minutes.  This place is LOUD with live music,, a great atmosphere,,, but if you are seated in the middle of the restaurant,, it will be difficult to have a conversation at your table.    We had a great time,, our waiter (with a Boy George look) and our waitress were very personable,, and engaged in a welcoming conversation while taking our drink orders and throughout our experience.    Our party of four,, we ordered the fried chicken, Green chili stew, salmon, and shrimp Caesar salad.  We enjoyed our appetizers of Prosciutto deviled eggs, and pork cracklings,,  which were quite tasty.  Our meals came out timely,, considering the amount of business on a Friday Night.  Dinners had great flavors,,   we definitely will return.    A happening place, plenty of free parking.",

    "text": "You know those success stories that start with, \" I didn't even finish high school?\" They are few and far between, but sometimes the education system just holds you down, man. Such is the case with Culinary Dropout. I think the chefs behind this rebellious culinary institution felt their creativity stifle in the classroom.  The dishes were kind of experimental but not too far out there to be considered wackadoodledoo-ish. Soft pretzel nuggets accompanied by a provolone fondue. Homemade chips served with a whipped onion dip concoction. Charcuterie and fromage plates. Artichoke salad. Short rib orchiette pasta. Apple cinnamon monkey bread. It was a simple selection, yet executed with passion so every bite resulted in an \"ooh ahh\" moment. And to top it all off, the cocktails (particularly the Clown Punch topped with a pomegranate froth) were fun and designed to flirt with taste buds.  The decor is a confused mix of brick, chandeliers, mood lighting, loungey booths, communal wood tables, an inside and outside bar, open kitchen area, etc. But none of it clashed or begged for attention, it blended nicely together.  The live music on Saturday night had everyone at the table clapping, singing, and nodding in agreement. The band really made the experience complete.  Certificate or not, Culinary Dropout makes the grade for me.",

Very tentative, very knowledgeable on his wines and also very kind as he gave me free dessert for my birthday!! My fiance and I ordered the antipasto cheese and meat platter which was delicious. I ordered the ramen, which was good but needed sriracha to spice it up. My man got the fried chicken which he raved about! Lastly, the monkey bread is a must if you love dessert!!!",

It's such a popular appetizer here, which is kind of unfortunate because the pretzels are coming out on the colder side, not tasting as warm and fresh as I'd like.    Homemade Lemonade - Dee-lish!  They do it right here.  Caramel Corn - Unexpectedly out of this world.  Lows- The rest of food  I've experienced here.  Bistro Steak?  Came out raw yet tough yet chewy.  Confusing? Yeah, I don't get it either. I sent it back and the server was very responsive and brought me out a burger instead:  Pub  Burger on Pretzel Bun - Sounds like it would be great, but the quality and taste of the beef seems to be lacking.    A week later, I gave them another shot.  This time I had the turkey pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread.  This is what I'd order if I were to come here again.",

The food (salmon, burgers, appetizers, Korean rib eye) were all cooked as we specified and were excellent. Changing up the combos a bit/different vegetables, etc. was no problem. Specialty cocktails (I loved the Room Service) were great as was the beer. The place has a hip vibe and there is plenty of room to roam, noise level moderate so you can visit. We are retirees who enjoy all age groups, and this restaurant is good for all. Ages of our party: 30-75. We live in Old Town but would happily make the short trek to Fashion Mall area to eat here again. Well done Culinary Dropout!",

    "text": "Whenever I get a chance to take a friend or family member to a new place I want to take them here for many reasons:  1. The atmosphere ROCKS. I love the green emerald chandeliers that line the dining room. The stage the live music plays on is cute and quaint. If you are sitting inside, the leather restoration hardware-ish couches are so plush and comfortable. If you are outside the wrap around couches and ambiance is great!  2. The fun drink menu - my husband is a beer enthusiast but still every time we are here he cannot help himself but ordering the brown bag special for $1.50! He loves playing the guessing game of what awful beer will be in the bag! Who cars if its a nasty beer he says for $1.50 its worth it!  I happen to be a fan of the blueberry beer myself!  3. The FOOD - I love the meat and cheese small eats menu.. the jamon iberico meat is WORTH the $13, just trust me. Its a black hoofed pig from Europe. If you were to order this meat from a butcher it would run you about $138 a pound which is why the small portion you get is $13 but it is AMAZING and the only place in town that I know serves it. Order that along with the goat cheese and you will be in heaven! For the main course, you have to absolutely order the prime rib dip. God, I am craving one right now! The meat is so tender you do not even have to chew. The bread is so soft and the provolone cheese adds a perfect touch. They serve it with French Onion Soup to dip your sandwich in which adds a great compliment to the sandwich!   There are many things on this menu to satisfy just about everyone. My only complaint is there can be a super super long wait at times and ordering a drink can be a pain but other than that this is my favorite among the Fox Concept Restaurant chain!",

    "text": "Though we only came for dessert... from the decor, to the beer list, to the Lou Reed quote on the menu, for an FRC joint... Culinary Dropout is pretty good.    I'd wanted to try this for spot for a while and this Friday we decided to head over from the Biltmore area and stop into CD around midnight for cocktails & some dessert.   The decor is pretty funky, awesome oversized chandeliers, cool chairs & tables & great purple wall across from the bar.  At midnight there was still a 30 min wait for a table for 2.  We scored a little table outside and a couple couch seats.  Nice.   Granted... the location in scottsdale lends itself to a barrage of douchebaggery in and around the restaurant, but you cant expect much more when going out around here, so no surprises.    We were pleasantly surprised when looking at the beverage list.  They had a pretty good craft brew & import beer list, both on tap and in bottles.  They also broke down their specialty cocktails by liquor which was a nice touch.    Being a bit of a bloody mary snob, i had to try the Bacon infused vodka Bloody mary.  Normally, this isnt the time of day for this drink, but had to give it a shot.  It's nothing to write home about.  The infused vodka is good, but the it wasnt even served with Olives, i had to order them extra.  Weak Bloody Mary... very disappointing.    The food menu looks pretty good.  No matter what waist widening fare you're in the mood for... from burgers, to pasta, to ribs; you can find your comfort fare at CD.  We came for something sweet and the server suggested the Salted Caramel Custard or the Apple Monkey Bread.  I'm a sucker for the Hot/Cold combo, so we went for the Monkey Bread. It's made-to-order so prepare to wait 15 min for it.  It's basically like an apple cinnamon roll with vanilla ice cream... pretty delicious.    Overall... if you can put up with the Scottsdale crowd, Culinary is worth trying at least once.  However, if you are in the market for comfort food, there are better places to try (Chelsea's Kitchen!).  On second thought... Maybe it was the Lou Reed quote that sold me on this place?  It certainly wasn't the Bloody.   Oh well... Fox Restaurant Concepts is good (but rarely great) at what they do.",

I understand trying to keep the flow going, but being asked if I needed a drink or if I was going to order dinner every two minutes got really old really fast.

The waitress Brittney, as well as two others (Lexie & Justin) were three of the most personable people I have had the pleasure of attending to my needs while dining. And Britney went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We started the evening off with house made potato chips & onion dip as well as the pretzels & fondue which would have thrown us over the top, however, we were warned to not overdo it, so that we might enjoy the dinner menu. We then moved on to the main course which was extremely satisfying. We split two main dishes between the three of us, the Sweet Potato Cannelloni and also the Bistro Steak, and were NOT disappointed. I'm not sure which I loved more, so I will just say order either and you will be happy! Not to be outdone, may I say kudos to the bartender for serving up one of the smoothest Lemon Drops I've had in quite a while.

Once I overcame the smell and was seated from the strangely under-dressed hostess, our waiter came to get our order in an even stranger bandana jean look that was very curious.  We started with the pretzel Gouda fondue appetizer.  Very gooey and delicious as expected, maybe too much salt, but gooey and delicious.  He had the salmon and I tried the French Dip.  The salmon was delicious and none was left on the plate.  I'm a sucker for French Dips, the one's that melt in your mouth and have a great au jus.  I was sadly disappointed here.  To start, a strange mayo based dressing is applied liberally giving the, what I would assume is the most tender and juicy, roast beef a strange creamy taste and texture that is not pleasant.  The au jus is a strong french onion soup that does not go well with the sandwich.   Overall I felt the place tries too hard to be different, too hard to be the cool place in town.  The food was a 4 (the salmon was truly excellent), the environment was a 2...I split the difference.",

    "text": "Now, a somewhat dinner review.  My out of town visitor said she wanted a place like Buffalo Wild Wings, but better. And she wanted beer. I said...ok. Culinary Dropout it is.  Last night, we were promptly seated, ordered our beverages, and then got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Absolutely amazing. As always. It was my day off from the gym, so I said...\"What the hell!\"  Instead of ordering entrees, we decided to order a place of prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and some manchego cheese, served with crostinis.  Everything was flavorful. The sun dried tomatoes were perfectly marinated, the manchego was at just the right temperature, and the prosciutto was finely sliced like a delicate piece of angel paper. What the hell is angel paper? I have no idea. I am just free-writing. Go with it.  Bottom line, you will never go wrong here. Appetizers, Entrees, Charcuterie....anything. This is your spot.   Service is a tad spotty in the evening, but I suppose that CAN be a good thing if you are in a good conversation.",

The service was good, our waiter was very sociable and had many suggestions. Now to the food.  We got the pretzels with cheese and honestly, I prefer the mall pretzels with cheese. The salmon was also only okay. The drinks were refreshing but I was really turned off by how dark and loud the place was. Was definitely over hyped for me, probably wouldnt go back",

Seriously guys if the music was less deafening you'd still be hip and people could actually converse and enjoy the without shouting.

We found this place almost by accident, just driving by and the name caught my eye...definitely happy we stopped here for lunch!   The waiter was prompt, pleasant and efficient. Our food was excellent. I got the Spring veggie salad -- so fresh with an awesome vinaigrette! The BF got an amazing Pub Burger -- so big and juicy (but he immediately picked off the tomato)! I wanted to order the 12-hr Roasted Tomatoes and \"Crusty bread w/ good Olive oil\" for an appetizer. The tomatoes almost tasted like they were kinda pickled...and they were cold, which we didn't expect, but SO tasty! Sweet just like candy! BTW...It was after ordering this that I witnessed a first...THE BF ACTUALLY ATE THESE TOMATOES! Now THAT is saying something! I was totally blown away and actually took a picture! :o)   With such a diverse menu, there is something for everyone...the little \"checklist\" appetizer menu was kind of neat in my opinion. Roasted beets, different little tapas-like meats and cheeses, crusty bread w/Olive oil...you could make a meal out of all that stuff alone!   Tons of different drink options is always a plus too...even though I didn't get a drink at lunch, I saw LOTS of different ones I would have liked to try if it hadn't been 2:00 in the afternoon!   All in all, I was very pleased and would definitely go back. There are so many more interesting things to try!",

It does have a yard to \"play\" in with cornhole, horse shoes and other fun group games. I think it would be a fun place for happy hour or if a group is meeting up before a night on the town. We had the house made brats, the pretzels & fondue (was cold & unimpressive), and the Italian grinder. I might try this place again for drinks and appetizers.",

Great place overall, I will definitely be back to CD in the near future. My only 2 gripes are that the \"grilled asparagus\" was cold for some reason, possibly because the rest of the platter was a cold preparation and the bartender was nice, but didn't interact quite enough with me and there were only a few people at the bar (she seemed content conversing with her coworkers rather than the customers).",

    "text": "After a 2 hour horse back riding session in the \"desert\" me and the group of people I was with needed a place to chow down. Someone suggested we go somewhere in downtown Scottsdale which apparently is really fancy/upscale.   I'm pretty the Restaurant name kinda throws some people off about what type of food/quality of service that they offer. The outside has a nice sandstone finish to it with these giant pillars; it almost looks like a modern day palace. The inside decor was something I didn't expect. It had a very dark/gothic feel to it with black leather chairs and hanging chandeliers.   Our waiter was very casual and for the most part attentive to our needs. The atmosphere is more laid back and our waiter gave us a few recommendations and was able to inform us of exactly what dish was what.  There's a mystery Brown Beer Bag special where you can pay 2 bucks and you get a random beer in the brown lunch bag (which sounds like fun/crazy, but I dont drink, lolz). For an appetizer we all shared the Pretzels with Cheese Fondue... OMG that may be one of THE best appetizers in recent memory. The pretzel bites were warm, soft, and the sprinkled sea salt was a great addition. Dip that into the Provolone Cheese and it is a mouthful of wonderfulness. I could have easily eaten that whole appetizer by myself had I not ordered my entree.   I got the fried chicken, which apparently is VERY good. The fried chicken did not disappoint. The chicken itself was very moist and tender and the chicken skin was absolutely delicious. The chicken skin was lightly fried and had a hint of honey to it. Chicken came with a thigh, breast and a leg and two buttermilk biscuits; could have easily been shared by two people. My only small complaint was that the chicken could have used a little bit more seasoning, if it wasn't for the chicken skin, it would have been game over for me.   My girlfriend got the pork ribs and it seemed like a good idea, but in the end, it probably wasn't... first off this is a WHOLE rack of ribs so it is definitely a two person entree. The sauce was almost a little too sweet and the ribs itself didn't offer anything to rave about. It tasted good, but not great.   Prices are a little steep with most of the main entrees starting at 15+. The name kinda disappointing b/c I was expecting unusual flavor combinations but it wasn't there. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would go back for those pretzels and cheese, yum!",

    "text": "Culinary drop out is a great fox restaurant. Not my favorite for dinner but for lunch with friends it's wonderful.  The atmosphere is so fun and different, with big comfy chairs and large dining tables, makes it easy to sit and talk for hours.    As you can expect from a fox restaurant all of the food is great, definitely recommend the pretzels and fondu to start, and their salads are great.  The only thing I didn't like was the grilled cheese. It is a little bland and the cheese was not melted all the way, not ideal, but it may also be a matter of preference on how you like your grilled cheese.   And just like every fox restaurant service is key. They are constantly making sure your water or drinks are full and very attentive to your needs. Overall this is a great place for lunch, I'm sure it's good for dinner but I associate the menu more with a lunchtime gathering, or a happy hour affair.",

We went early this week and were greeted wonderfully and had the recommendation to get the crowd favorite pretzel balls - WOW, AMAZING! Hands down you'll have to try the Hijinx & Rye as a cocktail as its new the menu this month (Nov. 2015).** My friend and I split the pork nachos and the butternut squash cannelloni. The crew just switched up the cannelloni and my goodness what a packaged mix of flavors. Love this place so much and can't wait to try it out on Saturday for some rockin' live music. Thanks culinary crew!!  ** Fun fact: Culinary Dropout creates the menu and the atmosphere that helps you and your tastebuds explore a bit out of your comfort zone.",

The decor is modern and funky and I loved the giant crystallized chandeliers.  I couldn't believe they had la fin du monde in bottle here; unibroue is one of my favorite breweries and I've never seen it available in restaurants before!  Kudos!  I decided on the fried chicken for my meal, and man it did not disappoint; skin on the outside was perfectly fried and the chicken was incredibly juicy.  They also lightly drizzly some sort of sweet sauce on top that makes the dish unique.  The sides were all tasty but not breath taking.  I tried my sister's pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun and that was also really tasty.    I will definitely come here again.",

    "text": "Wow!   Went here for lunch as fellow helpers ha written that they had a mean Prime roastbeef sandwich also called the French dip by some. And it was certainly mouthdripping amazing! Tons of thinly sliced juicy roastbeef on a slightly grilled loaf with mayo and a creamy cheese. When dipped in the secret concoction called jus it was like an mouthgasm!!! It was extremely good that i even forgot about the hefty 17 $ pricetag.  We also chared grilled cheese sliders with bacon that tasted really good as well. The cheese wich ever one they use was packed with cheesy deliciousness and the salty bacon complimented it perfectly. At 10 $ these little babys where a bargain.   Tried one of the local beers and i think it was called Scottsdale Blonde. Crisp and refreshing in the desert heat and a hit with the food.   The place has a great ambiance and interior decor and the place is located just a short walk from Fashion Square.  Our waitress was fast, funny and did great.    Would come back for more the next time im in town!",

I came with a party of 8, we were all fairly low maintenance, only two of us were drinking and we ordered quickly. Our waitress made the whole experience uncomfortable by being so short with us from the beginning. She blatantly didn't wanna be there, she took 20 minutes to bring out my friend's drink (on a Sunday at like 2:00PM, it was barely even busy). She kept skipping past us and wrapping her arms around another staff member and clinging to him for dear life, which seemed unprofessional. For such a high caliber establishment, I was underwhelmed by the service. Really disappointing since we had made reservations for my fiance's birthday and I was hoping it would be a good time.   Atmosphere was pleasant enough, kind of loud, food was mediocre. I won't come back on my own accord.",

There are a lot of options for a local meet-up, but Kelly's attitude and enthusiasm, along with the positive energy from the rest of the staff, were a clear validation that Culinary Dropout was the right choice for such a meeting.

I decided on the Prosciutto deviled eggs. Craze great. The prosciutto is crisp, the deviled eggs are perfect and there is a taste of truffle oil. Let's say a flavor explosion.  Louie reco'd a lovely Pinot Noir.  I chose the Ahi salad as my main course. Nice steak size pieces perfectly seared along with crisp lettuce, cashews and great Asian flavor.  Service and food 5 star.

But be careful, it's a large order and will fill you up quickly. My friend had the sweet corn cannelloni which was tasty and wonderfully unique, while I had the apple, currant, blue cheese mixed greens. The variation in flavors was outstanding and I especially loved the paper thin mandolin sliced green apple.  We both agreed this would be the perfect place to come to on a lazy Sunday afternoon; indulge in some good wine and go crazy on the separate, and vast, anti-pasta menu. Some proscuto, olives and a distinctly aried selection of cheeses. Yumm!  We arrived at 11:15am and by 12:00 the place was completely packed. Great atmosphere. Love the long bar, open kitchen and super cozy/comfortable seating. Well done.",

    "text": "Went for a quick lunch with my husband after reading the rave reviews. Have to say I was a bit disappointed. Had the pretzel with provolone fondue---pretzel bites were warm and tasty and so was the fondue, but it tasted more like cheese whiz than a restaurant fondue and definitely did not taste like provolone. Ut was creamy and warm--I can see this as satisfying drunks, not real lovers of fondue. Had the Cubano sandwich, another disappointment. The roll was too soft and couldn't hold up to the thick piece of pork--which had a lot if fat pieces. And who puts lettuce on a Cubano? It made it slimy and half way thru I switched to eating with a fork. Fries were good. The decor was ok---a bit dark for my taste, that always makes me think they're hiding the dirt in the floor. We had a nice server though.",

My friend and I stopped in for lunch before leaving to go back to DFW. Sometime between lunch and our cab, my friend lost her jacket. We called CD to see if it had been left, when we were told no, Evan offered to run up and down the street looking for where she may have dropped it. He did not find it, but the fact that he took time from his busy lunch crowd was impressive. Thank you Evan and all the CD staff for your help!",

There were many other unique cocktails on the menu, such as the bacon infused bloody mary, that I am dying to return to try.  The menu is inbetween bar and restaraunt type selections.  I had the shaved rib sandwhich with french onion soup for dipping.  It was excellent.  The decor in culinary dropout is posch with dark purple walls and large chandeliers, which is complimented by their tattooed and mo-hawked staff.

    "text": "I had the pleasure of going to the Culinary Dropout to celebrate my son-in-law's birthday. Our reservation was for 6:45 on a Saturday evening. We were seated promptly. Our server and the hostess were pleasant, helpful and overall it was a great experience for the food and service. We had the signature dish of pretzels and cheese sauce and they didn't disappoint- delicious!! We didn't finish them all but they went home and were enjoyed later. My son-in-law and I ordered specialty drinks which were good but seemed a tad overpriced. My fish and chips were really tasty and the Korean beef dish was a big hit too. The reason for only 3 stars was it was incredibly difficult to have any kind of conversation in this restaurant (and they had plenty of open tables when we arrived but by the time we were leaving it was packed inside and out). They were getting ready to have a band play after we left. There would be no chance at all to speak with your  company once a band started so I'm glad we came when we did!",

    "text": "Yes, 4 stars for the reason you go to a restaurant: Food! Quality was good.  Atmosphere was Trendy Scottsdale.  Love the name and well executed theme of the name throughout - menu, tables, decor, employee uniform etc. Food was really tasty, Pretzel fondue hit the spot.  Monkey Bread was great, seasonings on the entrees were done with tasteful restraint. Waitress was cute as a bug's ear, although she did forget part of our order; to her partial defense, the place was packed but I would have liked to try the forgotten appetizer. The Death's Door adult beverage was a perfect concoction: I want a large pitcher with a long flexible straw . . . floor here I come!  But for $10 bucks it better be darn good. I was not surprised to learn that this restaurant was part of the Fox Family of restaurants as my other experiences with them have all been top notch (Olive & Ivy, Bloom, Sauce). Fun place, I will go back if nothing else to try more tasty food. Final Rating: 4.3",

    "text": "I was invited to Culinary Dropout for a Moms night out - and as a mom - nothing is better than having good food, a few drinks, and nice conversation.  I really wanted to be excited about this place but as soon as I saw the drink list was more extensive than the actual food menu I knew I was at a bar (which isn't what I was going for)..  That being said - the drinks were exceptional - between the HomeEc Martini to the bacon infused Bloody Mary...  Hands down, FIVE stars..  Overpriced?  I think the pricing aligns with the market/area..  The place was loud..  Like, really loud..  Which again, kind of aligns with the whole \"bar\" feel.  It wasn't conducive for conversation that didn't require yelling..  However, the general appearance of the place gives your senses a little tingle because it is beautifully decorated, from the multiple GIANT chandeliers to the purple, textured wall, it was pleasing to the eye.  Which was a nice distraction from the groaning in my stomach from the hour and a half wait.  When it did come time to be seated and order I was forced to review that scant menu once again..  Because of all of the Yelpers recommendation, we got two orders of the pretzel fondue, as well as one order of oysters.  Nothing wrong with any of it.  Oysters were nice and fresh and properly prepared (very important!); the pretzel fondue was good but I didn't see God or anything.  Pretzels were nice and fluffy.  I kind of 'get' the 'dropout' concept from the menu - meatloaf, fried chicken, beef stroganoff, burgers, gnocchi - I guess they are giving a twist to comfort foods..?  The descriptions were lacking, and I didn't read one description that screamed \"eat me! I'm awesome!\"..  I finally settled on beef stroganoff simply because I imagined it would be hard to be disappointed.  It was obvious to me they are using quality, fresh ingredients.  The stroganoff had peas, nice pieces of meat, mushrooms, and a nice beef broth; but ya can't give a girl a dollop of sour cream?  C'mon man!  It wasn't terrible - but it wasn't the eighth wonder of the world either.    Will I go back?  For drinks, yes...  But will reserve my meal for a better menu, with better tasting food, probably some where else.",

She heard me mention that I wanted to check out the possibility of holding my corporate Xmas party here.  Someone mentioned it and I hadn't been here yet. We checked in and we were told we'd get a text when our table was ready.  We hung out at the bar ordering drinks and after waiting 30 mins, I approached the hostess.  She advised me that we were already seated.  Well obviously we weren't.  No apology or anything, just hold on while they figure out how someone else took our table.  After we were finally seated, waiter came over.  He was ready to take our order right away, forget more drinks he just wanted to get the food on order.  Needless to say, this guy lacked basic customer service skills.  After taking our order by memory, he came back 5 mins later to try and remember the order.. Really?? Write it down if you can't remember it.  We made the best of this mess.  Food was ok, just tainted by the other experience.  I was shocked at the lack of caring about everything that happened.  Not even a visit by a manager.  Mistakes happen, but how your service responds to the errors is everything.  This experience cost your establishment a 6k+ party and a repeat customer.",

The decor is fantastic: texture, color, light and ambiance is a True bonus to the food. It's very laid-back \"rocker\" but inviting to all.  Though I would skip the \"fried chicken\" - - the flavor is nothing to write home about (the chicken fingers were better, leaner and non-greasy compared to the fried chicken entree but it might be the house made sauce that may have saved them). The name of the place makes me think that the Chef should up the anty on flavor.and the biscuits are def better at KFC - - Even the $5 cheap salad is just Ok.  What I do highly recommend the pretzel ball and provolone cheese fondue!  Yes, yes, yes.    Their happy hour is a noteworthy event: in the summer they have $4 wine coolers that are addictive (wine, dash of liquor, soda and fruit) and a select menu of half off goodies. Plus a decent beer selection.  All in all, everyone SHOULD give this place a try at least once.",

I guess three middle-aged patrons weren't nearly as interesting as a table full of Girls' Night Outers. Once the ladies showed up, I sat for the next hour with no refill of water and no question of whether we wanted dessert or not.  When we finally flagged him down(after lots of arm-waving and attempted eye contact)  for the dessert menu, he said, \"Well, there are only four things,\" and he hurriedly rattled them off and did NOT wait to see if we wanted any of them!  RUDE!  Fortunately for this awesome restaurant though, I will only knock off one star for this jerk, as the rest of the place is to die for.   I love the design and decor.  As it was about 82 degrees this day, the front windows were opened up into the patio area.  Lots of cool chandaliers throughout the place, and for lighting over individual seating areas?  Trouble lights!  Just like the ones my dad uses when he works on stuff, only slightly more trendy. Seating included leather couch-type things, and at the end of the place was a giant screen television.  I would love to come here to watch an important game!  By the way, my dining companions thought the noise level was a bit too loud, but I thought it was fine.   Now for the food.  I ordered the pork belly Cubano, and it was wonderful!  BF ordered some sliced filet medallion things that were so perfectly cooked and flavored.  Our friend ordered some kind of squash dish that didn't appeal to me, but she said it was great. Additionally, we had the pretzel fondue appetizer, and I devoured it.  Finally, the beer selection contained a variety of bottle and tap selections that would appeal to anyone's taste.    Would I return?  Definitely!",

I was marinated overnight fried to perfection and drizzled with honey.  They gave me 3 generous pieces and some delicious mash potatoes and gravy. Good fried chicken that meets my Louisiana standards is hard to find in Phoenix, but this was really good in a different kind of way, the seasoning was light but it worked with the dish.  I gave the place a three because of the \"vibe\". The service is kinda weird.  I don't really even remember my waiter....no one was in uniform and it was hard to tell who worked there....I'm pretty sure they were trying hard for that laid back everybody's welcome kinda vibe...Def a surprise for the location.   Anyway, I went for lunch and it was pretty empty so I'm def curious of how  my experience would be on a Friday night.",

Their drink combinations are pretty good. Their food is small portions for the price! Atmosphere is unique and almost every table has a different set of chairs and style which is different.   The reason I am giving Culinary a terrible review in stars is because my poor boyfriend got food poisoning from the Beef Stroganoff! We came into AZ to re visit my college town and friends and he was out all day saturday, most of sunday, and still not up to par on Monday! I realize this was not their fault that their food was possibly contaminated, however, it was the aftermath that I was unhappy with...  I called the restaurant to talk to the manager....he didnt seem to sympathetic with saying things like \"did he go to the hospital?\" or \"I served 27 of that dish Saturday Night and I have not had one complaint yet.\".....definitely not looking for any type of discount but with working in customer service for 10 years that is NOT the way to handle things. He was proceeding to tell me the length of time it can take and how it could have been from something earlier that day or the night before...really?! Needless to say even though I did not feel sick from the food I will NEVER return to this restaurant again!!! I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone!",

I want to steal their purple wall and get a mini version of those wonderful green crystal chandeliers for my bedroom. Their booths are so comfy and the lighting was just right. When it cools down I definitely plan on spending some time having cocktails on their beautiful patio.   Our server, Tori was adorable and fantastic. Not only was she incredibly perky and attentive, she knew the menu like the back of her hand. And the way she described all of the items made me want to order one of everything. Also, she encouraged us to take our time. We started with an app, hung out and talked, then ordered an entree, hung out and marinated on that, and then ended with dessert. We were there for quite some time and never felt rushed or abandoned. Tori made our dining experience more than stellar.   Now to the important part. The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FA.maz.ing&s=4aee80730ffff567fdb322f19b83185a536631f483a9b42a0225a5c361e9c703\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.maz.ing</a>. food.   First out, the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. Oh em gee. I LOVE pretzels and cheese but I will never be satisfied again unless I'm having it at Culinary Dropout. The pretzels have just the right amount of sea salt (not too much) and are so fantastically soft. The fondue was the perfect temperature and they have a little candle flame to keep it the right consistency so you can take your time eating. Although those pretzels disappeared really fast.   Our entree, the sweet corn cannelloni. Thanks to Tori warning me this is seasonal and will change to butternut squash I was all over it. My friend and I split this and the serving size was still plentiful. I want to find whomever came up with the idea of putting mashed corn inside the cannelloni pasta and kiss them on the lips. The butter sauce was so flavorful but not too heavy and complimented the corn flavor instead of distracting from it.   Dessert. Words cannot describe. I have lived in a world where I believed the best dessert in existence was creme brulee with berries until last night. The salted caramel custard made me want to utter inappropriate noises of delight. Topped with their caramel popcorn and chilled at just the right temperature, my friend and I indulged in silence as our taste buds rejoiced. If I wasn't classy I would have licked the cup.   So, Culinary Dropout, I am in love. All I want to know is when we will meet again??? I'll be longing for you until that day.",

The first part of a really great experience  started when I called for a reservation and was told I could get a patio table, everything else was booked. An hour later Ashley called back and said they had a table  inside, 4 back from the stage. Upon arrival we were seated front & center and immediately greeted by our server, Tori, who took really good care of us all night.  Interesting menu, not  same-o, but not funky either. Every item seemed to have something about it that made it a little extra special. We had seared tuna salad, shaved prime rib dip - with good fries ,  fried chicken! Apps buffalo  chicken meatballs yum but really good  was the pretzel fondu.  Because RC was there drinks made with Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine  were offered , which is the best tequila available  and should be offered  all the time.  All good to say about this place ,  nice venue, quality food and drink, fast service with a smile ,  seemed like everyone who works  here does because  they want to, making  this a go-to choice.",

The BIG problem we had was the filthy cushions on the very uncomfortable benches.  Not dirty from weather but huge stains from spilled food and drink! It was disgusting! Patio floor clearly needed to be swept too.  Will we go back? Perhaps...not sure...",

    "text": "Let's start with the amazing service; my parents and I had every small request fulfilled with expedient service. For example, the table quickly went through all the bread that was paired with the well executed smoked salmon plate. The new aged hipster waiting on us quickly got a few more slices without billing us. Runny poached eggyolk combined with the tartness of the pickled onions making for a indulgent breakfast themed bite. This is not the \"lox\" styled salmon, rather a flaky, smokey, structurally sound piece of fish. That dipping sauce was something like a garlicky mayo, maybe a thicker bolder ranch.  The meaty and well marinaded ribs get a savory recommendation. These were some of the leanest ribs I have seen in a minute, perfect temp and melt off the bone.. Outback's quality kept declining, so I'm glad I found a new place to get my fix. The flavor balance leaned more towards sweet than jalapeno yet didn't cross the line in to too sweet. They didn't skimp on the amount of sauce mopped on these bad boys.  Another example of awesome customer service was when my ribs came out with fries instead of the veggies I subbed. In less then 5 minutes I had a pleasant side salad Good looking out Hipster-Senpai! Dropout again killed the dressing, which was a buttermilk ranch drenched in parm.  Chairs were epic level comfortable, and atmosphere was just right. Who cares what their staff dresses like when the service is top notch?",

The soft pretzel balls and cheese fondue was a fun, new dish to start things off.  Next was a mix of cheeses, meats, and olives chosen on a sushi-style card.  Entrees of Korean-style steak, garden salad, and grilled cheese sandwich with bacon made everyone happy.  And the monkey break dessert left us cooing before we waddled out the door.    Service was excellent from Caitlin.  The rest of the service crew reminded me of the cast of Beverly Hills 90210... without the token minority.  And as the father of two little girls, the tight pants one of the service gals was wearing made we want to buy a remote island to shelter them.  Still, the experience was superb.

It wasn't under a heat lamp or in anything to keep it warm, I even made a comment to the rude bartender who wanted to finish drying his wine glasses before approaching me asking why the food wasn't being kept warm and that it would be cold before getting home and his response was that it was warm. Then he printed out the check and all he said was \"cheers!\"   I ordered the steak, fish and chips and soft pretzel, all of which were cold and soggy, the steak was already cut up and half of it was fat.

    "text": "This restaurant was a great find for us on our recent vacation to Scottsdale, AZ.  We were headed to a matinee showing of the Dark Knight Rises movie at Fashion Square Mall, so we looked around for a place to grab lunch in the area.    We picked Culinary Dropout because we liked the witty name.  We had no idea how great this would be.  We started off with some of their signature drinks and a bowl of their pretzel bites and cheese fondue.  It was fabulous!  We had to order an extra bowl of pretzel bites because they were so good.  Then came the main course...    I asked the waiter for some recommendations of their \"specialty items\", and he pointed me to their fried chicken with mashed potatoes, biscuits and honey drizzle (over all of it).  I was hesitant to order that for lunch because it was the middle of the day, and I didn't want to be too full for the movie.  However, another waiter said I would \"love it\" so I took the plunge.  And am I glad I did!  The crust on the chicken was so brown and crispy and the honey glaze gave it a hint of sweetness.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and wonderful as they were topped with cream gravy.  And last but not least were the fluffy and light biscuits.  Having grown up in the South, I've had some good meals of fried chicken, biscuits and mashed potatoes, and I would put this one right up at the top.  I didn't eat all 3 pieces of chicken, but what I did have was amazing!  Finally, the women ordered a caramel popcorn & pudding dessert that was totally different than anything I had eaten before, but it was just as wonderful as everything else we ate that day.  If you have a chance to check out Culinary Dropout, I would highly recommend you do so.  They even have live music to boot (although not while we were there).",

    "text": "I was visiting Scottsdale for a weekend and stumbled on this place on Yelp. It has a fun atmosphere and cool live music. When I went, it was a reggae band. They have TVs all around so if you want to watch a game I imagine it's a good place for that. The best part... They have the most AMAZING pretzel balls! They're perfectly baked. They come out piping hot (actually you should probably take it slow at first). They have a slightly crunchy outside and soft middle. They have just the right amount of salt. It comes with some sort of fondue as well. I ended up asking for yellow mustard and thought it was divine. I would come back here just for this!! I also ordered the ahi tuna salad and my friend got a strawberry kale salad. We probably would have been more than fine splitting just one of them. The salads are very healthy portions. Overall a nice experience.",

From the host taking our seating request to the bartender that bluntly told us what drinks were great and which ones we might not like as much, to the awesome waitress that sat down with us and gave us advice on where to look for housing in the area, what things to do, and generally was just incredibly pleasant, Culinary Dropout has some amazing staff that alone elevated the eating experience. The drinks were great, even the shandies, were perfect in the pleasant Arizona heat. The mules were delightful, without the pretentious copper mugs. We only had the appetizers, but they were so generous, we shared four among us and couldn't finish them all. The Jamon Iberico on the charcuterie plate was delicious, the mussels with chorizo to die for and the Korean inspired pork belly appetizer was amazing. I'm normally not a big fan of pretzels and cheese dip, but these guys do it right with small pretzel rolls that come out warm and a cheese dip that actually tastes like real cheese and not some artificial stand-in.   This place is great. Bottom line. If you're in Phoenix or Scottsdale, it is definitely worth checking out.",

I would recommend   drinks- room service moscow mule   food-  meat/cheese. sopresatta, manchengo, marcona  the butternut squash raviolis or corn cannelloni fun  the M.A.C. Burger   (wayyyyy better than McD's makes- yes there is a middle bun present)  Many more dishes to try with their seasonal menu. Will definitely be back, especially for happy hours and after going to Fashion Square.   Walking around the Scottsdale waterfront afterwards is definitely worth checking out.  *~*~*",

The house potato chips are impressive though!    It never fails that someone will order the fried chicken, and I'm not sure why it's never been me.  This restaurant is good at comfort food... the meatloaf is worth trying, I've heard great things about the burger, and I love the kale and sweet potato salad.    Some of the speciality cocktails are pretty good, albeit overpriced.  I stick to some house wine and I'm never disappointed.  Like all Fox Restaurants, their iced tea is lovely.  Make a reservation if you're coming on the weekend, so you avoid a wait.  Then kick back, enjoy some live music and good food in a lively astmosphere!",

The pretzel fondue and the oysters were NOT popular at our table and I was a little underwhelmed by my sweet corn ravioli, but my companions liked their fried chicken and the rib eye well enough.

Once finally seated we ordered another round of drinks (we ordered while waiting because, well, we were waiting forever) and TBH, just not very impressed with them. Several people in my party weren't even able to drink them, not done very well. And for the price, that is not what we were expecting. Beyond that, the food was just OK. Everyone ordered something different and the only one who said they were extremely happy was the person who ordered the fried chicken...which is the only reason any stars at all.  The antipasto tray was also really good, however, since they didn't cook (just a tray of cheeses, bread and veggies) I can't really give stars for not cooking.  The waiter was not very attentive and half the drinks were sitting on the table (probably about $40 or $50 worth) and he didn't even ask if ok or if he could switch them out or really much of anything at all. Overall, poor experience and overpriced. (grilled tacos are about $20)  Wouldn't recommend. Just not worth the $400 bill when there are a number of different amazing restaurants all in the same area to go to.",

    "text": "Fox Restaurant Concepts has been very succesful at developing small regional groups of eateries like Culinary Dropout in AZ and True Food Kitchen in CA. They have numerous other gems in their line up and do a good job of creating formulas that work. They key is that you don't feel like you are dining at a chain, it is more personal. This location does brisk business most nights and the weekends are quite busy.  A reservation is a good idea, as wait is more the norm than the exception. Live music is featured on some nights and be prepared, it's loud to the point of distraction even in the dining area. We did have a small wait, 20 minutes, even with a reservation but just grabbed a drink at the bar.  The menu is loaded with the latest and greatest of the current trends and some twists on comfort food favorites. Things aren't overly priced either so that is a bonus. I met up with some old work buddies during a recent visit to Scottsdale.    This Salad was definitely big enough to be an entree salad when paired with an appetizer or two. Hearty, flavorful, satisfying and not overly dressed it was excellent!    BUTTERNUT SQUASH & KALE  Salad with  pear, Brussels sprouts, goat cheese, pecan, caramelized honey vinaigrette and I added the smoked salmon for 5 bucks.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=8HJTEvryKEsyOnuqEJV0JQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/culi...</a> Crispy Brussels Sprouts- A great appetizer to share.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=GlEMzJs_hUoS_ZwML7PFSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/culi...</a> Loved the mussel dish but did encounter a touch of sand in a couple, not a biggie but  they could have been prepped a tad better. Great flavors however and a minor quibble.

    "text": "We are here on vacation and were excited to try this restaurant. Our group of six made a reservation and still waited ten-fifteen minutes to be seated. We then waited over a half hour for our drinks and an HOUR AND A HALF for our food. The counter for food pick up by wait staff, which was completely by all customers, was completely covered in dirty plates. The entire staff was pacing through the place looking stressed and angry. The bathroom was dirty and had no toilet paper. At one point a waitress was walking through the dining area carrying a bottle of bleach. When we finally received our food there was absolutely no apology  for the wait time. Two out of our six plates were served cold. There was no acknowledgment of poor service, no explanation for delays, the manager was present and walking the floor but never came over to discount the check or apologize.   I 100% do not recommend.",

I did order the Italian hoagie to split with my husband and he ordered a different entree. The Italian hoagie is a little bit of a rip off but his dinner was fantastic. Portion sizes great and the location is very, very pretty. They do have valet parking you just have to pull around the side of the building and that made it very easy for one of our guests who was walking with crutches. The volume is a bit louder so if you are there to have a conversation make sure they either put you outside or up against one of the outside walls inside the restaurant.",

Culinary Dropout's plate is customizable with plenty of options that range from $3-$7 per item. We got the bread (lightly slathered in garlic oil and balsamic; very yummy), nuts, jam and a few cheeses -- favorite was the truffled brie.   I ordered the seared tuna salad and \"yesterday's soup\" which was basically hot and sour soup. The soup was decent, but the salad was phenomenal with cashews, wasabi peas, carrots, cucumbers and carrots. They didn't skimp on the tuna at all and the meal left me feeling perfectly full.   Overall, there were plenty of pescatarian and even vegan/vegetarian options. Would highly recommend!",

I ordered nachos to go which I would normally never do because it always comes out soggy. Not only was the food absolutely delicious hot and fresh it was also thoughtfully and neatly packed in a way that shows they had the customers eating experience in mind. The amazing part is that I was late to pick it up and after they were closed. at 11:05pm when walked in staff greeted me fast and friendly. Freakin awesome better than the best!

I also want to highlight the Bob Marley portrait on the wall; including the name of his best hits from The Legend Album. They also had a very nice stage with a full band set, nirvana and Jimi Hendrix posters that gave it a retro rock feeling. The full bar also stood out with a plethora of alcohol to chose from and they have a friendly staff.   Now, I'll share a few things that I disliked. For one, the lighting in the facility was very dim to the point where my family and I had to use our phones for light to gander at the menu. \"The struggle was real when the fam and I all wear glasses to see\" Not too much of a biggie but they can be a little more considerate with the lighting.   Secondly, this isn't my first rodeo at this establishment and honestly can say they can do better with their Mac burger. I felt like the bread to meat ratio was way off. I got so full half way through the burger eating all that bread. That middle piece of bread was not needed at all. Further, the flavors are there and it really reminds me of a Big Mac burger. Just with better quality ingredients.   Overall, his place was still enjoyable and had a very chill vibe atmosphere. I rank this place 3 stars because parking was also a hassle. Sorry. :/  Hopefully, the next visit will be a little more pleasant.",

We had the pork belly nachos which were mega filing along with the homemade kettle chips and dip which I couldn't stop eating! I had the roasted salmon for my entree (pictured) and a coworker had the meatloaf (pictured). Others had the fried chicken, club sandwich, trout, steak tacos, ribs and a partridge in a pear tree (joking) but we literally had half the menu and everything was amazing!

    "text": "Did you guys know that 8 billion chickens are consumed every year here in the United States?  That has nothing to do with my review but now you know.  ;D   I have always been a fan of Culinary Dropout and The Fox Restaurant Concepts.  I must admit that this location seems a lot more bougie than the Tempe location but they still have the same great food.  Anyways, let's jump into the review!  VELVET DEATH, $11 [Death's Door gin, Cointreau, Velvet Falernum, and Absinthe]:  I never had a drink at any of the Culinary Dropout locations that didn't get me buzzed.  The Velvet Death was no exception.  My vice of choice at CD is usually the Dropout Classic Mule but my lunchdates inspired me to try something new.  Velvet Death tasted of summer with its bright citrus notes.  After half a glass, I was feeling great!  An afternoon at the museum on an empty stomach was probably the culprit but hey, let's drink!  SOFT PRETZELS & PROVOLONE FONDUE,  $10.50 [with sea salt ]:  These are always a must and must be shared with the table.  Pillowy soft pretzels served with a mini cauldron of provolone cheese on top of a burning tea candle.  Just get these and dip everything into the fondue.  MA...THE MEATLOAF!?!, $15 [served with green bean, mashed potato, and gravy]:  That was a solid and classic meatloaf.  I do think Pioneer Woman's meatloaf is better so cook that ish at home.  I took my green beans and ate them like french fries after dipping them in some leftover provolone fondue.  Could this be the result of the Velvet Death?  Maybe.  Don't knock it until you try it.  So yes.  Culinary Dropout Scottsdale is a beautiful place with comfy couches and lots of good eats.  For me though, I rather go to the Tempe location.  They have games for all the hipster bruhs to play, yo!",

The pretzels to start with were carbtastic, if anything a little salty. I ordered the Fried Chicken & even though the waitress warned it would take a bit longer, it actually came out at the same time as the Pub burger (which my friend ordered) in less than 15 minutes. The chicken had amazing flavor, but wasn't easy to eat & had a LOT of bones. The honey biscuit was flavorful as well, and the coleslaw added fresh, crunchy texture to the mix.   I visited again the next week with a huge group of friends & wasn't as hungry as I was the previous week, so I ordered the pretzels & split a chicken caesar salad. My second experience at Culinary Dropout was disappointing. The chicken caesar was extremely poor, they forgot the chicken & there were very few croutons. That second experience made me edit my previous review; I don't need to go back to Culinary Dropout again.",

We ordered drinks which were very good and ordered some food. First we ordered off the antipasto menu, goat cheese and grilled asparagus.  Then we ordered the gorgonzola chicken salad which was outstanding. The only negative was that the service was very average and could have been friendlier.",

    "text": "I personally love going to this Culinary Dropout. I feel that this one is upscale restaurant vs. the other locations in the valley. In addition, this location is very relaxed and the fact that it is right across Fashion Square is definitely a plus.  I have tried their pretzel cheese fondue, boy is that delicious. I have also had their Fried Chicken Biscuits, which are very tasty. Their salad options are great and are delicious.   The staff there are very sweet and always asking their customers if they need anything throughout the customers dine in experience.   The only reason why I did not give them a five star is because if you book them on Open Table for reservations, they do not affiliate themselves with the points that open table has. With that being said, it's not going to stop me from going here.",

We ordered a few drinks and had lunch. I had the seared tuna salad, which was delicious. I would highly recommend if you're looking for something on the lighter side. Cocktails were tasty but pricy.  We hung around until HH started (3pm-6pm M-F) which included draft beers, house wine, and well drinks. There were also a few snacks on HH as well.  I cannot comment on the nighttime atmosphere, but overall I'd say a great option for lunch and HH in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout, I love you and maybe I'm just getting old but loud live music + community seating right against the stage does not make for a good Friday night dinner out. Last night we went to Culinary Dropout for dinner and it's been awhile since I've been there during their live music performances. We asked for first available because of the wait and True to my luck, the table they chose for us was the community table with seats closest to the stage. Not only could we not hear each other over the music, but the seats were so far apart, it nearly turned into a silent film dinner. Luckily another seat a little bit further away from the stage opened up so we got to move. It was still loud but the seats were closer and we only had to say \"huh?\" a couple times. Culinary Dropout still gets four stars in my book but I wish they could figure out a way to do live music without damaging the ear drums of the eaters in front or hurting the conversation of two people on a date. Or maybe warn the restaurateurs and offer them another option.",

Ok so THE PRETZEL WITH PROVOLONE CHEESE IS A MUST. The pretzels were a perfect golden brown with a nice crisp outside and warm and soft in the middle, and the cheese was so good. I think it was my favorite pretzel I have ever had. And I get pretzels and cheese everywhere cause I love them. I ordered the trout with green beans. The green beans were great the fish was OK. The sauce that came with the fish was a little weak in flavor otherwise it was good. The fish was cooked perfectly for sure but again little more seasoning for me. My girlfriend got the Cannelloni and butternut squash. We all shared a little bit so we could try everything and I have to say the Cannelloni was excellent. I liked it better then the fish for sure but it was equally as good to what my brother got. He ordered the pasta with short ribs in a tomato cream sauce. Meat was a little fatty but omg it was tender. The only thing bad about this is there were beans in it that were over cooked so it made the dish a little grainy. But overall the dish tasted great. We liked everything so much. I have heard a lot of good and bad things about this place but we were happy with everything and we will come back to see if they are consist ant. I say give it a try. Its weird cause they have a lot of TVs there so I'm not sure if they are trying to be a sports bar or what. Either way it was good!",

There was a live band and they were all right, but I found them to be a bit loud and made it difficult to talk to the people at the same table. The drinks here were really awesome. I really enjoyed the clown punch. The dirty school girl was also really good. The wait staff was really attentive and would check up on us every so often that we rarely found ourselves without want, but not so attentive that we found ourselves annoyed. The food was all right. I ordered the fish and chips here. And it was just all right in my opinion. I prefer a thinner filet of fish so I get the crispness rather than the softness when getting into the meat of the filet. The real highlight, for me, was the dessert. They have an awesome apple monkey bread that is made to order and served with vanilla ice cream. Now I'm not one to like to eat fruit, especially apple, in my desserts, but this was just so good. I'll go back again just to top off dinner with the monkey bread :)",

Once seated, ordered the pretzels and cheese, chicken salad, and tuna salad. All of the food was great! The cheese fondue was unique and yummy. Pretzels resembled the texture of a cake doughnut (minus the sweetness, of course). Both salads were very filling and full of flavor. Overall, I've tasted the food here, but I probably wouldn't choose to come back here on my own. Nothing against them as a restaurant. They just didn't blow my skirt up.",

I had a idea of what I was in store before walking in and was surprised upon arriving. The first thing I noticed was the crowd. Not your typical Scottsdale fucks. Kind of a CenPho meets tempe and have kids type of people. I didnt see a single guy wearing a bedazzled foil shirt. The second thing I noticed was the music. Band Of Horses, Queen, Nirvana, and other great bands hitting my ears at the perfect volume. Am I dead, cause this is heaven. Oh wait...I'm going to hell. Better company down there. Since they don't take reservations, which I think is a Fox Concept Restaurants thing, they gave me a buzzer. It was a bit applebees'ish. While waiting, I read off some trivia questions to my friends. After a 10 min wait we were seated. We instantly turned to the booze menu and ordered quickly. I was thirsty.  The second I saw the Smashed Irishman cocktail, I knew I had to have it. This was the best beverage that has ever touched these beautiful lips. I wanted to put my dick in it; I wanted it's dick in me. We decided to opt for dessert instead of a app and it was a wise decision. I ordered the Pub Burger. It was damn good but not the best I've had. Now back to the dessert. We got the Monkey Bread and holy shit...foodgasm! I'm not a huge sweets guy but I'd bathe in this shit! It was warm gooie goodness with its bestfriend of ice cream keeping it company. After all this you would think I'd be 'unbutton your pants' full, but not the case. I felt perfect. Then the bill came and I felt even better. Great food for a stupid low price. I cannot praise Sam Fox enough and Culinary Dropout jumps to my favorite in his line of restaurants",

We had three appetizers:  chips and dip (homemade chips - delicious), mussels, and the soft pretzel fondue.  We had to order more pretzels for the fondue as we still had lots of cheese left over.   For dinner, we had turkey pastrami sandwich, Cuban sandwich, fried chicken, and seared tuna salad.  Everything was delicious!  The seared tuna salad was a chopped salad with the tuna slices in it.

I asked for water and the server brought only one glass of water and didn't bother to ask about the lady's needs.  This venue is not for those who appreciate fine or even appropriate service.  Sam needs to educate his young servers on the finer points of courtesy.  Our server was also extremely bored with her job, her life, and her existence.  That's the impression we received.",

We took our Chef from the hotel also, and he commented the same.  DO:  order the pretzel bites appetizer with the cheese fondue - awesome.  The menu does cover all of the bases as far as having the burger, sandwiches, salads, some pasta dished.  I ordered the french dip, and it was good, not a whole ton of meat inside the big, big, bun.  My co-worker had a burger and it looked really good, and was quite large also, she took home half.  Our chef ordered the pastrimi on pretzel bread and said it was quite tasty, and another co-worker had their version of the cuban sandwich.  Again, everything was good, not blow me away, but good.  However, I do love the decor, and they have this huge beautiful big chandelier hanging.  The chairs and seating areas are all kind of mismatched and funky, but it works.  I love the patio and will definately check it out when it isn't 300 degrees outside in July.  The wait staff is not dissapointing either...Scottsdale's finest pretty people that can serve too.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I love a bloody mary in the morning!  Not every morning, mind you, but definitely a lazy weekend morning when I'm enjoying some brunch time with my crew.  I like mine with pretty much any tasty veggie tucked in - pickles, olives, celery, whatever...  So imagine how pleased I was when I ordered Culinary Dropout's bacon-infused Bloody Mary -- FREAKIN' YUMMY!  A little spicy, rich, delicious and fragrant... A BLT in a glass with vodka on top -- and a big ol' slice of bacon stickin' out.  But hold on, I got a little anxious -- let me back up for just a minute...  Culinary Dropout is in the location formerly known as Pink Taco.  I never went to Pink Taco because I'm just not going to eat in such a ridiculously trendy Scottsdale hangout, especially one named after a euphemism for female anatomy, so when I found out that trash hole of a restaurant was gone and this new gastropub opened in its place, I was anxious to check it out.  I have no idea what the decor used to look like there, so I can't compare (which I think is less biased anyway), but I really like the giant tin tiles lining the ceiling/walls, the gigantic glass chandeliers, and the comfortable and homey wood furniture.  The place is comfy casual but totally upscale.  When I arrived at the restaurant the hostess greeted me in a friendly manner, immediately disarming me and making me comfortable.  I was at a table of 10 girls, and our server was just awesome - friendly, funny, and helpful with the menu.  As an accompaniment to the earlier mentioned \"BLT in a glass\" I ordered the shrimp po' boy.  Wow!  Typically po' boys come on toasted baguette like buns that always seem to rip up my mouth.  I usually end up picking the shrimp off with my fork and leaving the brick bread to rot... Not so here!  My shrimp po'boy was on a soft roll, and the shrimp was chopped and mixed with a slightly smokey remoulade, so no shrimps rollin' off my plate! Definitely a big meal, as I couldn't even finish the second half, but my sweet server girl so pleasantly offered to box it up for me so no complaints here!  Not too pricey, as I think for 2 drinks and a sammich it came to about $30 total.  An extra bonus here is the patio, which lines the outside of the restaurant, looking out across Camelback toward Fashion Square mall.  There were both seats and benches (with backs) so the tables looked cozy and pleasant.  And our server said there's live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  May have to hit this place up again in the evening!",

Besides the $3.75 blueberry beer (which is cheaper than it is in Whole Foods, the food is wicked good.  There are so many things on the menu I cannot wait to try but the pork belly cubano was a must.  It was the best one I've had since I left New York and I've even visited Miami since then.  Great food, good prices, awesome wait staff.  There are a bunch of great reviews on here that go into more detail than mine...but all you need to know is that this place is great.",

    "text": "I went here for the NFL Season Opener, Saints v. Vikings, that Culinary had been promoting. We had a group of 8 and were able to get seated about fifteen minutes for game time. For a place with so much seating, I was impressed with their drink specials. $2 beers (mystery beers in brown bags) and an assortment of football themed cocktails for $4.  The food was also pretty good, we had wings, burgers, nachos, and chili. All of it was pretty good, better than typical bar food.   While the food, beer and location was great, this is not the place to watch any NFL games. There is only one screen, and then small tvs around the seating area. Even if you are on the side of the table where you can see a TV, it's difficult to see everything on the screen because they are so small, and the sound system is horrible for watching TV. Needless to say, if your back is to the entrance, you're not going to be watching every play.   This definitely made for a fun night, but it won't become a staple anytime soon.",

We sat on the patio in the last week of March and enjoyed our dining experience (not loud at all).

    "text": "Overall I (and my 5 dinner companions) were very impressed with this place. As many others have noted, the pretzel fondue (provolone) ($10) is outstanding. The \"crusty bread and good olive oil\" ($2) is also very good. Main courses were mostly to everyone's liking - after chowing down on the pretzels and bread I was glad I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Caesar Salad ($13). Though crispy, the shrimp wasn't greasy, and the salad had just the right amount of dressing for my taste (not too much, not too little). My wife didn't have as much luck with the fried chicken -- too much honey flavor for her. We took the rest home and I ate it today; I agree, though the chicken itself is perfectly prepared. A friend who ordered it had the same experience.  I also liked the interesting selection of beers, including some locals (like the Four Peaks HopKnot IPA - very powerful flavor, very good; and the SanTan Epicentre American Amber - light but good; they also offer lots in cans, which apparently is all the rage). True, it's too loud, and service was great albeit overly attentive, and one could complaint about the price of the drinks (but it is Scottsdale, after all). But overall a positive experience; I'd go back, at the very least for the pretzels.",

    "text": "i came here a few times on a little jaunt to scottsdale last week. the first time the wait was an hour and a half so my friend and i headed to the bar for a drink an then somewhere else for dinner.   the second time was for an early dinner we were able to be seated right away and started out with a few of the appetizers and drinks. i decided to be a bit adventurous and try the sauerkraut  a gin martini with a combination of orange marmalade and grain mustard it was actually quite delicious and complex. The anti pasti was nothing to write home about but if you are going to order something from that menu get the 12 hour roasted tomatoes they are really delicious. however you must order the pretzel bites and fontina fondue that was a really yummy starter and seems to be a favorite in the restaurant.   for an entre my gf and i split the grilled cheese sliders and the seared tuna salad. the sliders come with bacon and tomatoe on them and im not sure of the type of cheese. they were a little bit of a let down they needed to be seasoned with something.   the salad had a nice vinaigrette on it HOWEVER!!! the salad has cashews in it, the menu description makes no mention of cashews at all. i always assume that its common restaurant courtesy to mention if a dish has nuts in it because so many people have nut allergies or sensitivities.( I am one of those crazy nut people, cashews make me violently ill and i was really worried i'd be spending my saturday curled up on the bathroom floor)  so maybe in the future they could update the menu so there wont be any unpleasant surprises in my salad.   my third visit was for a late lunch after a friend had finished his game. once again we were seated right away this time my gf ordered the mac burger it looked like big mac but better, our friend ordered the shrimp po boy which looked delicious as well and i ordered the coq au vin which comes with lardons and is served on a generous bed of swiss chard. it was so delicious and i am determined to replicate the dish at home.   all in all a great time was had by all at culinary dropout i really wish i could give this place 3 and a half stars but i will definitely be back next time i'm in scottsdale",

From the time I sat down to the time I left, it truly was a great experience.  Had the Blueberry lager, which was great.  Had the pretzel nuggets and provolone fondue, which I have to tell you, YOU MUST TRY IT.  I know its just pretzels and fondue but everything is made on premise so its extremely fresh.  I had the short ribs with orecchiette pasta and I am telling you, I wish I had the receipe because I have never tasted anything like it.  I am still craving it and its been almost two weeks I am back home.  I finished with the salted caramel custard, and I was again not disappointed.  I had to share dessert as I was extremely full.  The dessert was topped with freshly popped caramel popcorn.  It doesn't get better than this.  I also had the dirty schoolgirl martini's and they were very good as well.  Staff was great and I truly recommend this place.  Now only if I can get that short rib recipe I would be so happy!",

I don't recall the cheese but the 3 we had were very good. We topped it off with a side of olives and a glass of red wine. Service was fast and efficient.  This place we packed out on a Monday night, that alone should tellyou something about the place. We were full and satisfied but I wanted dessert.  I ordered the chocolate cake to take home and it reminded me of a sheet cake you would pick up at the supermarket for a kids birthday.

It's casual brew pub meets fine dining and that is right up my alley. The location is perfect. There were chandeliers on the ceiling yet we had dish rags to place in our laps for napkins. Funny. I liked knowing that everything on the menu would be less than 20 dollars, so it wouldn't break the bank too. I highly recommend that anybody try the pretzel fondue. It was SO good. My boyfriend and I really liked the furniture, it seemed like it was straight out of an old hotel or something. It was cool. I tried the clown punch, it was tasty and a really good price! A lot of people complain of a wait to get in, but we were seated in less than 5 minutes on a Saturday night, so I can't say we had any problems with that at all. Way to go Sam Fox, this restaurant is a winner! :)",

It was VERY loud and not a good place to go if you are wanting conversation with the person you're dining with.  During the summer in Arizona, I think it is important to have a break from the heat. Unfortunately, the evening we ate at Culinary Dropout it was miserable. The restaurant was so hot. Our waiter was sweating and complaining that they had the \"garage bar doors\" open. It was unbearable!  I will return to the restaurant again- but not until the temperature drops 50 degrees or so. Hard to enjoy your food from a sweaty server and be uncomfortably hot yourself.",

As a whiskey lover who is not yet badass enough to drink it straight, it was wonderful to see actual house cocktails with whiskey that were nuanced and mild, and still let you taste the liquor. Both of our dishes were perfect and came in adequate servings and at the end of the night the bill was more than reasonable for the type and amount of food we enjoyed.  I honestly would have paid a lot more for it..  We went on a Saturday night and waited just long enough to have a cocktail at the bar first.

Live music on the weekends,  draws a large crowd, so get there early to dine, then enjoy the music.   Try the monkey bread,  and lose your head.  Convenient free parking garage entrance, right beside the location.",

Entrees are the ribs and fried chicken. Nothing disappointed these comfort food plates- the sweeter styled bbq sauce on the succulent  fall off the bone pork ribs was everything I wanted. The crispy fry of the chicken was perfect and not overdone, the meat still juicy and tender. Sides were good and thankfully didn't compete with the main course!   I can only imagine what this place turns into after dinner, hopefully a night soon I can partake!   Awesome looking patio.",

The food is excellent. We usually get the wings or the fondu to start, which are both amazing. In addition, we always get the turkey pastrami, which is very well prepared and tasty. Aside from the food, the atmosphere is great, the decor is great, and the drinks are great. Would definitely recommend this place if you're nearby and looking for a hip lunch spot.",

Everything came out hot and correct. Sat outside because of the music volume. Had family in for just a few hours and wanted to spend time and talk. Outdoor patio was nice. BUT, the metal chairs are f'n brutal! It's like something to punish a grade schooler in. HOLY  CRAP! They are extremely uncomfortable.

We could have just ordered a bunch of orders of the beets and called it a night!! We also had the cracklings. They were a bit salty for our tastes. We shared the ribs and they are delicious! Just enough spice and tender to eat. Finger licking good!! Our server Liam from North Carolina was excellent!! He gave us great service!!",

These kind of tables are generally small to begin with but that's ok, we're not going to have a full 7 course meal where we need room. Ordered an app of toasted bread with balsamic vinegar glaze drizzled over the top. Sounds mundane but it was surprisingly pretty good. I ordered the Grilled steak salad. I can't remember everything that was in it but it was amazeballs. If you're taste buds like to party, this won't disappoint. Fennel, bleu cheese, corn, homemade garlic croutons, sprigs of dill, onion, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, red peppers and of course steak cooked medium rare. The steak didn't have any fat or gristle or gross chewy bits, just wonderful meat. I took off a star for the hostess who when she wasn't busy was doing stretches at the podium and where the servers congregated to chit chat. The amazing food is what will bring me back and I'll definitely have a craving for the salad.",

    "text": "I've been to Culinary many times before. I always have a great experience. Good food, fun music, good drinks, friendly staff! All the characteristics Fox restaurants poses (that's why they're my favorite). However my most recent experience at this Culinary wasn't so fabulous. It was still good but it definitely wasn't how it is usually - must have been an off night!   I went with a big group of girls to celebrate a birthday. The server we had seemed a little overwhelmed with it all. Maybe she was new, and this is completely understandable - but I just wish management would have taken note of this and had someone jump in and help her (for her own sake). This is the only reason I thought I'd mention it in a review. A dinner that usually would take 1 to 2 hours took an upward of 3! Due to the fact that we were like the only table in the restaurant, this just didn't make much sense to us!   Enough about that though, when a food at a place like this is as good as it is, ONE poor experience with customer service won't turn me off. I got the garden kale salad and it was sooo yummy! Light, tangy, and fresh! I just loved it. I'm a picky salad eater. The dressing has to taste right to me, and it has to go well with the toppings on it. This is my new favorite and I can't believe this was my first time trying it! I'll be back again Culinary - I promise!",

A Very positive one!  I had a couple of snacks. The  Sherry glazed beets & goat cheese was yummy but l' d recommend ordering it for dessert and for sure order a side of bread with it. It is extremely sweet.   Next l had the prosciutto deviled eggs. It wasn't a slice of prosciutto like l expected but rather there were crumbs of grilled prosciutto.  There is a definite undertone of wasabi in the deviled eggs which was pleasant. My entree, butternut squash cannelloni was tasty! Homemade cannelloni smothered in echalotes \"bien suees\", julienne squash, sprigs of brussel sprouts, and don't forget the buttery cream sauce binding all the flavors together.  My hubby picked the fried chicken. I took a sample of the fried skin. It was very crispy and fluffy then it melted in my mouth. Tres bon!  Staff gave us a warm welcome upon our arrival. Wait staff was eager to please and extremely attentive.  Culinary Dropout was a definite 5 star today!  Bonne chance BTW, free parking is adjacent to the restaurant.",

    "text": "For a brand new, only been open for 2 weeks venue we were really impressed. I'm confident this place will easily be 5 stars and a favorite hang out of ours. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food was all quite a bit over salted and they reeeeally need to work out a better parking situation. Again, minor kinks to be worked out.  We arrived around 2:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon before going to the Sun's game downtown. The very small parking lot was packed and \"Valet Only\" the surrounding streets were neighborhoods and cars were parked in front of houses for blocks. If I lived in one of those houses I would be pretty pissed every Friday and Saturday night.  We almost left because we thought the place would be over crowded but decided to give it a try. The inside of the restaurant was decent sized and had a very comfortable and inviting vibe. The patio was ginormous to quote Will Ferrel and lavishly decorated with plush green couches and large wing backed chairs. Large light bulbs were strewn across the covered patio along with pretty chic chandeliers making for a lovely lit canopy in the evenings. Casual? Yes, you can wear jeans here but don't mistake this place for a trendy, of the moment venue were the patrons are dressed in their very best wanna be Scottsdale attire.  Enough with the decor (Oh, but I didn't mention the bathroom shocker.......)   We were there in the early afternoon, it was busy but we were seated outside promptly.  I ordered 2 appetizers, the \"Grilled Artichoke with Lemon Aioli Sauce\" and the \"12 Hour Slow Roasted Tomatoes\".  My husband orderd the Fish and Chips with Cole Slaw.  The artichoke was grilled perfectly, charred in all the right places with a hint of smokiness and not to oily. The lemon aioli was divine. There was a bit too much salt which would have been fine if all the other food wasn't over salted as well. The tomatoes were Roma style and served whole and cold which I wasn't prepared for. They were a nice accompaniment to my artichoke but were all-in-all over glorified canned tomatoes. My husbands fish and chips had a smoked flavor which was wonderful and the fish was cooked perfectly and fell apart nicely and was moist and flavorful again, a bit over salted but still good, all the more reason to order another beer.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and prompt!",

Both were fabulous! For dinner she had the Thai Chili Chicken wings and I had the fish and chips. Again, everything was fabulous. I've had good fish and chips in London, and London's best doesn't even compare. Wow. We're only in town for 3 days, and I want to eat there everyday...that's how amazing it was. And more than just the food was amazing. The atmosphere was great, not too loud, we were able to carry on a conversation without issue.

Several of the items on the menu are the same as The Arrogant Butcher so I put on my detective shoes (translation: used the internet on my phone) to discover that yes indeed, this is a Fox restaurant.    Oddly enough, the two items mentioned are the only duplicates from Arrogant Butcher.  The menu is casual gastropub fare and the drink list is fantastic.  Our waiter was attentive and kept us mired in food and drink.  The pretzel bites are a must order (here or at Arrogant Butcher).  We also ordered a meat and cheese plate - yum!  Drinks were inventive and tasty.  Dessert was delicious as well although I was a tiny bit disappointed in the apple monkey bread.  It was good but lacking a little something-something.    The outside patio is lovely.  I recommend going on a Saturday afternoon when it's not terribly crowded.    Bueno!",

    "text": "Hubby and I recently visited Scottsdale for a brief weekend getaway and based on reviews here on Yelp decided to go to Culinary Dropout for dinner on a Saturday night.  I knew based on reviews here that it would be a cluster bleep on a Saturday and it was but thanks to the dedicated Yelpers I wasn't shocked by that.  We arrived around 7:45 and of course the place was elbows to assholes as expected.  But yay...we must be living right because we had no sooner given our names to the hostess for the 1 hour long wait and stepped towards the bar to try and elbow our way in to try and get some alcoholic relaxation when 2 folks got up from their seats at the bar, hell yeah, we sat down and proceeded to imbibe while waiting for our table.  Thank you God.  Finally, 2 glasses of wine later (in my world that equates a little over an hour, you mean people actually keep time in minutes, for me I keep time by the number of glasses of wine I can consume!!!!!)  Pager finally goes off, go to our table, (place BTW is coolly decorated----green chandeliers....purple fabric on walls...overly hip, you get the idea right?  You wouldn't decorate your Mom and Dad's dining room this way, but hey, that is why we go out right?  To see how uncool and dorky we really are.)  Once seated order MORE ALCOHOL FIRST, that is always a must, forget the fact you just received at the bar a glass of wine and a beer that you haven't even touched, ORDER MORE BOOZE-guys, it's not my rule, it is what it is.  Then ordered the pretzel balls and fondue.  It arrived promptly was was delicious.  The hype about this appie is True.  It truly is yummy.  Hubs loves chicken (fried of course, if it has the skin and bones removed and is baked and healthy forget it.  It has to be in GREASE and dredged with all kinds of artery clogging breading or in his world it doesn't exist).  Me, don't really know where my brain was (how many glasses of wine are we into now.....oops not quite sure now) but I ordered the Stroganoff over the Meatloaf.  The cute pretty server informs the hubby that they are out of white meat, understandable, by this time it is approaching 9:00 on a Saturday night and the place is a total cluster but hubs ain't too thrilled.  He does have his standards,  GREASE=GOOD, BREADING=GOOD, DARK MEAT=NO WAY JOSE.  He asked if there was anyway he could at least get one piece of white meat.  This is very cool, the server went back to the kitchen and the chef himself came out and talked to hubby and assured him he would give him the last breast.  Don't know if it was actually THE LAST BREAST or if they were holding out, but it was cool that he took the time on a busy Saturday night to come out and speak to us and provide the exalted white meat for hubby.  Food arrived and was good.  However, to me Stroganoff should have sour cream to make it creamy and this had none, it tasted really nice but wish I would have gone with the meatloaf now.  Hubby enjoyed the chicken.  There was live music, think Mumford and Son's, and we had fun.  Only negative, if you want a romantic intimate dinner forget this place on a Saturday night.  It was noisy, loud and cramped.  But a cool space none the less.",

There's a PF's on the same block as Dropout and the choice should be clear. Even though Culinary Dropout is part of the mega Fox Restaurant Concepts group, it is unique and definitely worth a try.  Everyone has said it, but I'll say it again: pretzel and fondue ... uh, yeah! Get it, dip it, love it.   The prime rib dip sandwich (there's a dipping theme going on here, isn't there?) was terrific, too ... great quality prime rib. House made pickled peppers were perfectly pungent ... not sure if Peter Piper picked them.   Located at Scottsdale's Fashion Plaza, this is a fun place to land after you've shopped in the ubiquitous megastores and are ready for something truly uncommon.",

The best thing on the menu is the $2 crusty bread and good olive oil. It's to die for. Almost Tartine (SF) status. I love the antipasti set up - you can order a series of small bites to share while waiting on your main courses, and they'll serve them all up on one platter with side plates. We ordered the aforementioned bread, some Humboldt Fog (oh so good), beets, olives, and asparagus, and everything was delicious.  Then things started going downhill. The Italian chopped salad is seriously weak - the ingredients aren't actually chopped, it's surprisingly gloopy from the preserved bell peppers and artichoke hearts they had added in, and despite the multitude of ingredients, it didn't really taste like anything. The ricotta gnocchi had an overpowering amount of sausage, and there were more mushroom bits than gnocchi.  The trout was alright, nothing impressive. The fish and chips looked really good, but again, kind of flavorless. The only thing really up to snuff was the Pub Burger, which I would definitely recommend.   This place is probably cool on a Saturday night, but I would just recommend ordering carefully and finding a waitress who is knowledgable about and can advise you on the menu.",

That is a terrible shame, though, because the Phoenix metropolitan area certainly does have some of the best food I have ever had in the country.    Whenever possible, I try to give a restaurant a couple shots before giving it a review.  Since I don't live in Scottsdale it hasn't been easy to get back to Culinary Dropout for a second visit, but it was certainly worth the effort yet again.  Everyone raves about the \"Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue\", but it certainly lives up to the hype.  If I lived in Scottsdale, this would be the joint to gather with my friends for happy hour EVERY DAY just to eat these pretzels.  Personally, I have at least tasted the \"Shaved Prime Rib Dip\", \"Pork Belly Cubano\", \"Gorgonzola Chicken Salad\", \"Fried Chicken\", \"Kurobuta Pork Ribs\", \"Bistro Steak\" and \"Caramel Corn\".  Every single one of these dishes is generously portioned, packed with flavor, and unpretentious.  How refreshing to find a place with a menu broad enough to satisfy a large group of friends with varied palates at a really reasonable price.  The drinks are amazing.  Have them all, but start with \"Dirty School Girl\" and \"Smashed Irishman\".  And don't forget the pretzels...",

It was the Bistro Steak with fries, house salad, Jalisco Flower, Strawberry Martini and cheese fondue made us fall in love with this place. The drinks were extremely strong, the steak very soft, tender, juicy, and fries were plentiful. The cheese fondue was addicting, and the salad was interesting since we've never seen salad served in such a small bowl like that. Kyle was on top of everything, and took great care of us.

The French Dip type sandwich I ordered was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The fries were utterly addictive (*drool). They have this Paper Bag Beer special that's pretty cool too; it's a cheap beer (PBR or another of their choice) that they'll serve to you in a paper bag (at a cheap price). Love it, haha! I also snacked on these pretzel bites that you dip in fondue cheese; those were really good too. I'm certain Culinary Dropout has 5 Star potential, so I'm really looking forward to returning.",

    "text": "The girls and I decided to try this place out after having a few drinks at the W one Friday night. We all heard great things and I think I was the only one that hadn't eaten here yet. It was crazy busy and we waited about 20 min. or so for a table, the bar was even packed so we hung outside in chairs near the front entrance. I decide to go for the burger and fries and my friend decides to go for some sort of fish dish and my other friend settled for the apple monkey bread. My burger was big but very bland and the fries were standard, I could have gone to In-n-out and saved some money. My friend's fish and veggies were undercooked and the server insisted that was one of their best dishes at the restaurant....really O_o...after sending it back one of the manager's did come out and say that the food was undercooked and took it off the bill and offered to make her something else but my friend declined. The best thing about the meal was my friend's apple monkey bread, I could have eaten tons of that stuff!   Our server was extremely slow the entire time we were there and it took her almost 20 min. to bring our check after we requested it...we were 10 sec. away from complaining to the manager.   First impressions are everything so I am very hesitant about trying this place out again...we shall see.",

    "text": "Well to give you some background information on myself, I am a server and I have been in the restaurant industry for over 5 years. I went to Culinary Dropout with my family on a Sunday evening. This was quite a trip for us because we all live in the ahwatukee area, so that is about a 30-35 minute drive on the freeway. We were all excited about coming to culinary dropout, and some of our group had already been here before. Well sadly this experience was far from great. First of all, it took about 15 minutes for our table to be greeted, and then about 15 minutes more for us to receive our drinks. About a half hour later the last two of our group showed up, and then they had to ask a manager for help before any of us EVEN SAW our server. We order shots for the whole table and that was a huge hassle. You would think that if you had a table of 8, and they are willing to spend a lot of money at your restaurant you would make sure they were taken care of, but no. And too make things a worse it was hard to tell if they were even running the A/C.  It is the end of May in Arizona so of course its going to be hot. But when i go to a nice restaurant and expect to pay a good amount of money, i shouldn't be sweating through the entire meal. When we ordered our food that luckily all came quickly, and it was all very delicious. The food was okay, and I wasn't very impressed. I ordered the meatloaf, and that was good, but anyone can up ketchup on meatloaf and its delicious! My fiance got the the turkey pastrami sandwich it was good,  but mostly it tasted like a normal turkey sandwich, but the side salad with ranch was delicious! Sadly the service or lack there of, really made the whole experience more frustrating rather then enjoyable. We were there for over 2 hours and saw our server about 3-4 times. She seemed very overwhelmed with the tables she had to serve. It honestly seemed that she had too big of a section for one server to handle. Maybe ill give this place another chance for a date, but never again for a larger group of people. Just be warned if you come here it will take a while for anything!!!!!!",

    "text": "What Culinary Dropout is NOT good for:  - High Expectations - You have to take this place for what it really is... a gastropub. Not a restaurant dining destination. - The Menu - Don't come here if you're looking to be wowed by the food. - Special Dinners - Don't come here for special occasions unless your looking for a bar atmosphere with bar quality service.  - The Wait - Don't come here past 7pm wanting a table unless you don't mind a lengthy wait, so plan on hanging around in the crowded waiting area/bar for over an hour.  What Culinary Dropout IS good for:  - The Bar - Consider CD a bar, not a restaurant... so pass on a table and gab a seat at the bar! It's 10x more fun and the service is excellent! - The Atmosphere - Friendly, fun and a seen and be seen kind of bar. It's the perfect spot for a night out with a group of friends. Inside, the decor is a funky and fresh combination of chandeliers and textured walls with a mix matched assortment of tables/chairs.  - The Patio - Comfortable seating and fun people watching near Fashion Square Mall. It's a prime hot spot location. - It's absolutely perfect for day drinking. - An excellent place to watch a sports game!  - Bar food - As far as bar food goes, CD does not disappoint. Yeah the food is average if you compare it to a restaurant. But compared to other bar menus... CD's menu rocks! Try the ahi salad & the trout. - Great drink selections. Get the acai mojito and try out the paper bag special! And if you love bloody mary's you've got to try theirs because they infuse their vodka with bacon! - The pricing matches the quality of the food & drinks. Don't forget that even though it's a glorified bar, it's still one of Sam's Foxy spots.",

Because of the sweet corn it definitely tasted very sweet to me. So that was kind of a weird taste.   Honestly the only thing I enjoyed here was my drink. I ordered the deviant behavior. Definitely really good.",

    "text": "I came here on New Year's Eve day with a couple friends around 2pm. Our original plan was actually to eat at Olive & Ivy but the wait there was about 45 minutes and this place was only 20 minutes. The dining room was closed so we were seated outside, but it was a really nice day out so we didn't mind at all. I just started with a beer at the bar while waiting - they had a decent selection, I went with Lucky Buddha. Forget what the other two had but one of them ordered a bartender's recommendation and it was really good.  Our waitress was really nice and friendly, explained the menu and a couple of her favorites, and was very attentive. I started with the Italian chopped salad. At first that's all I was going to get but I added the soft pretzels and provolone fondue after because I wanted to carb up a bit before the NYE celebrations later.  The salad came with \"salami, turkey pastrami, ham, pickled vegetables, provolone, couscous, italian dressing\" (straight from the menu) and was delicious. A generous portion and full of flavor. And the pretzel bites and fondue were great. I'm not even big on pretzels but these hit the spot - warm, soft, and sweet.  My friends got the pub burger and grilled chicken pub. I'd say they enjoyed them because their plates were clean by the end of the meal.  I would highly recommend this place, great service, food, and atmosphere and not too pricey for the location and serving sizes.",

We have always quickly been ushered to a table and the wait staff serves you with a smile on their face. I love the environment as well.   My wife and I usually get the house made chips with onion dip appetizer and it is delicious. One time we got extra chips. I would recommend going during a happy hour, getting some drinks and this appetizer. I have also tried the meat loaf dish and it was very good, well cooked meat loaf and tasty mashed potatoes. This most recent time I got the fish and chips and it was incredible. The fish was perfectly crunchy balancing the delicious fish inside. The fries were also top notch. It was my wife's birthday and we were given a free dessert! What great service.   As a musician, I am anxious to come back here to see the live music. I will probably do that sometime soon. Lastly, I want to share that we went to the location in Tempe on a night when they somehow lost power. We were greeted as we came in with not just an apology, but generous coupons for our next visit. Go here, both you and your taste buds will be treated well.",

Greeted with smiles by super tattooed host & young hostess... got a great table right under bob Marley (even though young hostess took us a terrible way through not too crowded dining area- we got stuck in the only crowded part and had to turn back-) had a decent greeting by server, obviously trained with a whole 'welcome have you been here before' rap... we answered 1st timers and she had a rap for that too, but while it was informative- it was said by rote- too fast and w no emotive quality at all. Too difficult to decipher. Genuinely engaged her in conversation regarding the fried chic timeline and the truth of how long it takes. And ordered it.  She was so into her rap, didn't hear my husband order- had to get her attention with a quick hand gesture and repeat his order.   Spilled our drinks all over the table next to us. Appetizers were great, even kids liked to spicy capicola.  Dinner comes- she came to check we if everything was ok-& started to walk away before I even got the chance to ask her where my order was- the fried chicken we spoke about - she totally forgot to place the order... ps- it was not worth the wait once it did come- after the 3 other people in my party were finished.  Disappointed",

There is easy underground parking under the restaurant to keep your car out of the Phoenix heat. We made it to the restaurant during happy hour, and we began our night with the happy hour red sangria. I was definitely not disappointed! Our waitress Mackenzie was sweet and attentive, and she was patient while I waited for the remainder of our party to arrive.  After a few drinks, we ordered the pretzels and cheese. For such a simple offering, I was surprised how great these ended up being! I would suggest ordering them with jalapenos for a bit of added spice.",

    "text": "This is a mixed review. There were some things I loved at the restaurant and some things that were disappointing. Let's start with the things I loved... The pretzel balls and cheese fondue, our server, and the caramel corn. I could eat the pretzels and caramel corn all day long and we had a very nice and pleasant server. Those alone would make me rate this a four star.  Now to the reason I rated them two stars. I asked our server  for a recommendation and he pointed out a pasta dish he liked. He said to add the prosciutto and I took his suggestion. My cousin also ordered the same dish. I assumed the would be an up charge for the addition, but when the bill came I was schocked. The charge for the prosciutto was $7.00!!!! This is an up charge of 50% of the meal for two paper thin slices.  This made my lunch portion pasta dish $22.00. My cousin also had this ridiculously high up charge. Adding scallops or shrimp costs less then $7.00. Had I been informed I would never have ordered it.   Before I had gotten a look at the bill the server came back and told us that he did not charge us for the iced teas or the caramel corn. At the time I thought he was being cool, but maybe he realized that he never informed us and was trying to compensate. Btw the iced tea was $3.25... For iced tea? Since I did not see sodas or tea prices on the menu I did not realize it, granted I supposed I should have asked, but even in Paris , drinks are not that expensive. We had three iced teas, had we been charged for those, we would have spent $23.75 on iced tea and four paper thin slices of prosciutto...  In the end our bill was $75. For a salad, two pasta dishes and pretzel balls... Actually it would have been almost 90 had we been charged for the tea and caramel corn... FOR LUNCH...... That is shocking.... Really really over priced and to not inform customers of a major up charge is not cool, which is a shame because our server was really fantastic other than that, however that was a biggie.   I am going to have to eat ramen noodles for weeks to make up for such an over priced lunch... I am sorry to say I would no recommend it, nor will I return. I can't afford it!!!",

We had skipped lunch and a full day thus we arrived an hour early.  Plenty of tables open by plenty I counted over 5 and more outside that needed to be cleaned.  There was a young man and girl at the hostess table.  We asked if we could be seated early; they both were quick to point out we were early.  Then the young man said he could seat us but we would have to eat quickly as he would need the table back in an hour????  I have never in my life been asked something silly like this.  I just moved here and finally have a piece of home with me and you want me to rush my meal?   Wow!  Then to make it worse the girl states you are early what do you expect?    Then asks us to sit at the bar as it is \"family friendly.\"  If they worked for me and treated my clients this way,  it would be unacceptable. Less of condescending tone and more kindness.   We wanted to enjoy your restaurant and see what all the rave was about, sadly we did not get the opportunity.",

Other than that, the ambiance was right, chairs/benches are comfy, our server Matt was always on top making sure our glasses were full and we had everything we needed.   We started off with the pretzel fondue; Yum! My main dish I chose the Grilled chicken club. It was better than you're traditionally made club. The bacon gave it this wonderful sweet taste I wasn't expecting.  The homemade fries were good, not at all greasy or oily.  I will definitely bring friends and family here again.",

Food was good and cocktails (Great Moscow Mules and Moonshine Apple pie flavor shots) were even better. Our Bartender was super friendly and took care of us greatly.   The pretzels with warm fondue were to die for!!! MUST TRY....Huge portion and meant to be shared :-) I also tried the smoked salmon bruschetta, It was just okay nothing too special about it I also had the Seared ahi tuna salad, it was yummy with a perfect amount of ginger dressing and wasabi peas without over powering the salad.

I'm a big dessert person so I ordered the salted caramel custard & the apple monkey bread.   The monkey bread was warm, soft and tasty. If you like apples in your dessert you'll love it. It wasn't as cinnamon-y as I would have personally liked.  The custard was divine. It's topped with caramel popcorn which I picked off.   They have an outside patio seating area and indoor seating as well. Prices averaged around $10-12 per entree.",

I'd definitely make a return trip. Seemed less crowded than the other locations, but maybe that's because I visited on Sunday night.   Minus a star because the service was a little spotty.",

Appetizers come out, zero drinks have yet to make it to the table ( Bar isn't full) then the appetizers come and we wait another 5 minutes for water and another 15 for beers in total 30 minutes to get a drink. Water  should be served if the kitchen or bar is behind, we eat the cold appetizers and leave to the Thirsty Lion across the street and have excellent service.

    "text": "On a Saturday night, we on the patio overlooking Camelback.  It was a beautiful night.  Our server was friendly and had good taste in wine.  She recommended a couple of wines that we really enjoyed.  I wish I had remembered her name.  That night, we ordered the charcuterie board, chicken wings, and fish and chips.  I could go without the latter.  But charcuterie board and chicken wings were awesome.  I highly recommend them.  I think that was the best they had.    At other times, I've had the hummus, pretzels and fondue, and fried chicken.  None of it was good.  In fact, food lacked flavor.  I want chicken to taste like chicken.  You know, when you don't want to eat the skin but it's so good.  The pretzel didn't taste like much.  It would have been better if I had picked up hummus from Trader Joes, fried chicken from KFC, and pretzel and dip from Auntie Anne's.  All would have tasted better and cost less.",

    "text": "This place is beautiful! I love the open atmosphere it creates with long large tables, large chairs and open windows and doors to the patio area. The chandeliers hanging in the main dining area add just that bit of \"fancy\" the place needs, perfect touch. I really enjoy the patio seating this time of year, even though you are sat close together to other groups for some reason you still get a privacy vibe. I don't know if it's the way the tables are set up, or the company I was with! They have a small stage inside that they have live music played some nights, but I don't really enjoy it for I feel its a little too much for the restaurant.  The food is delicious! We decided to get the onion dip and chips for an appetizer, something really easy that you can eat at home right? Well Culinary makes a great dip! We couldn't stop ourselves, trying to remember that our main courses were coming! I had the rainbow trout! I NEVER eat fish so when I am randomly craving it, this place is where I come. It's smothered in almonds and this delicious creamy sauce...... HANDS OFF I don't share this dish. My boyfriend decided to ordered the fried chicken (which you have to wait a little extra time for) and it was definitely worth the wait. The chicken was moist and tender and the sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw were like eating at grandma's house.  I am very impressed with the staff here. On a Wednesday night, it was pretty packed, for 2 we had to wait about 30 minutes but the staff is very courteous by grabbing your cell number and texting you when your table is ready. The bar had a few open seats, so we were able to have a drink before dinner. I like that there are no uniforms here, each of the staff members are able to show off their individuality and personality with the way they dress, which I feel makes them more comfortable and friendly. Its really hipster, the staff is very friendly and laid back! If you're not paying attention it does make it a little hard to find your waitress or waiter, but you should be so kind to pay attention to the people taking care of you for the evening.  Certainly a great place to put on your list. Great location, great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food! Keep it up Culinary!!",

I went with a group of people and we split two appetizers, the soft pretzels with fondue and the potato chips. These where actually pretty good, the only downside was that the server didn't inform us that the \"happy hour\" portion are some what smaller than the normal appetizers so that left us all a little put off.   When the meals arrived everything seemed to be in order. I can't speak for the other people who I was eating with, but my pork belly sandwich could have been much better. It seemed very one dimensional and lacked any other flavors than ham and mustard. Had this included some sort of aioli or spread I think the dish would have been elevated to desirable instead of just wanting to put it down.   Overall it wasn't a bad experience but it is not a place that I would recommend to a friend unless they only wanted pretzels and fondue lol.",

We had a reservation for 12 people, but the birthday girl and I got there 5 minutes early so we could sit at the table and be ready when everyone got there. The hostess was very rude and said we were too early and that we needed at least half of our party to be seated. Firstly, 5 minutes is too early?!?! Secondly, when we had 5 people she would not seat us, because we needed 1 more person...  When we finally had 7 people she looked us up and down very disapprovingly (probably because we weren't in skimpy clothes) and walked us to our table. The place was packed and very busy, and our waiter was running around a little frantic. I understand it's busy, so that didn't bother me much. He was really great and said happy birthday to the birthday girl and apologized for not coming sooner. We all ordered some pretzel bread, which was amazingggg, and some drinks and he was really excited for us to be there. However, we didn't order a second round of drinks and he got very cold and started to become almost rude. Apparently if you're not a big drinker don't go there, even if you order $300 worth of food. Overall, wouldn't go back or recommend, but the decor was awesome.",

The nook where the band plays up front.  The bar.  Heck, even the people are pretty. ;)  I love their pretzel bites and the meat and cheese boards.  All delicious.  I had a bite of the meatloaf and I gotta tell ya, didn't love it.  I'm honestly not a huge meatloaf fan so I'm not a great judge, but I didn't even feel that the green beans were very delicious.  (That's okay by me though, I would never order the meatloaf.)  I had the red blend of the wine and it was really yummy, my friends all did mixed drinks or beer - all were satisfied.    There has only two things I was dissatisfied with in the two times I've been.  1.) Convenience of parking...(just valet).  2.) The service on my second visit was terrible.  There were 6-7 of us all having cocktails, but not loud by any means.  Our waiter wanted nothing to do with us.  He failed to explain that the meet and cheese that my two friends ordered would be on one plate.  Typically that WOULD be self explanatory, unless two people order it separately not sitting next to one another.  That was awkward when one person ate the food for two people.  When asking for the other individuals food the waiter rolled his eyes and quickly explained they were both obviously served on one board.  Could have been good information to know ahead of time.  My only point from my rant is, if you don't want to deal with groups in social settings serving may not be the occupation for you.  As a friendly group of people we're never a pain to serve and are always happy to tip! :)  I have no doubt I will be back to Culinary, maybe I'll give the one in Phoenix a try - it looks like it has a pretty cool vibe to it. :)",

Don' let them sucker you into valeting. which is located just before the garage entrance.   They serve happy hour specials throughout the restaurant. The service is a bit slow. We ordered the pretzels and fondue app to start and it took forever to come out to us. I thought we would get it with our dinner, luckily the fried chicken took so long that it wasn't something we really should have worried about. In all fairness they did warn me that it would take awhile, which I appreciated and did take forever but I was craving fried chicken after being out in the sun all day so I was going to get it damn it. So worth the wait. It was crispy deliciousnesseses. The pretzels and fondue were good too, but you don't get enough pretzels to scoop out all the yummy cheese.    I have only sat outside so I didn't notice the loud music. Sit outside if you want to catch some great people watching (or car watching in Mike's case) from the patio and you want to be able to hear your dinner mate(s).",

They did make up for it with their soft pretzels & provolone Fondue, which I might say was damn good.   I ordered the ricotta gnocci which was also amazing. The portions are quite large, so I didn't get to finish. I'm definitely going back when I hit up spring training next year.

    "text": "I overindulged here last night in a pretty grotesque way.  Our server Corey was on the ball - when we arrived these HUGE, delicious platters of charcuterie and cheeses and accoutrements and bread and everything else you'd ever want were laid out on the table, along with, oh 7 different wines (there were 10 of us - don't judge). Imagine my surprise when the menus came around after I had already eaten my fill of meats and cheeses to the point of wanting to unbutton my pants. I knew I didn't have it in me to officially eat anything else, so I ordered the kale and sweet potato salad (which was delicious, and which I will be eating for dinner tonight) and held my fork at the ready to steal a bite of everyone else's food. The chicken curry was spicy and delicious.  The fried chicken was okay, but had a weird \"undertaste\" that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  The meatloaf was as good as my Dad's, and that is saying something - it was seriously delicious, and was like, mini loaf sized, so not a small portion.  The ribeye was perfection - a little crunchy on the outside from a perfect sear, perfectly medium rare, and delicious.  Those pretzel bites with cheese fondue are about the size of tennis balls, so be ready for that - \"bites\" they are not.  I couldn't leave that alone unfortunately; I am a huge sucker for liquid cheese. At this point I seriously wanted to die.  I could hardly breathe I was so full.  That is until the desserts that my sadistic dining companions ordered came out.  The monkey bread was good, the chocolate tart thingy was good, but friends - the caramel custard with caramel corn on top?  I will dream about it. The staff is super hip and cool, the girls are amazing looking and fantastically dressed to boot, the guy performing with his guitar was perfection, and the decor is something out of my dreams.  How do you not like this place?",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I am usually a pretty forgiving person when it comes to restaurants. I really try to see the goods when there are bads and I will usually give a place a second chance since I understand that the wrong item is sometimes ordered. Yes, in a perfect world, every item on a restaurant menu should be amazing, but that simply is not the case. Anyways, I digress. This review is going to be pretty harsh because I honestly found nothing good about this place. Thank god I only came here because I had a gift card that needed to be used. I would have been pretty pissed if I actually had to pay for what we got. When entering CD, I was somewhat impressed with the decor. However, even though the seats look big and cozy, I did not find them to be that way at all. Also, the hostess was not overly friendly. She wasn't mean or anything but not friendly either. The hubby and I decided to order the pretzels and fondue that everyone else raves about. It was ok. The pretzels were soft but most were not hot, and the fondue was simply ok in my opinion. For entrees, I decided on the sweet corn cannelloni while the hubby chose the fried chicken. I would also like to add that hubby was going to order the 36 hour ribs believing they would be fall off the bone, what with cooking for that long. The waitress was actually considerate and thoughtful enough to let him know that since they were not babybacks, these ribs were not going to be fall off the bone and most past customers actually felt they were a bit tough. After that information, he decided to retreat and order the chicken instead.  The entree portions were actually larger than we had expected. However, neither entree was impressive. My \"cannelloni\" turned out to actually be ravioli. Also, I was surprised by the intense flavor of bacon on my dish, which don't get me wrong was ok since I eat meat. For someone who is vegetarian on the other hand, this really should have been mentioned on the menu. The flavor was ok, but really nothing impressive. The husband easily allowed me to try his chicken, which I knew was not a good sign. Usually when something is really good, he will be a pain in the ass about letting me try it and usually will tell me order my own. The chicken itself was cooked ok, but the batter had no flavor to it and the honey drizzle was only in certain places. The hubby was disappointed in the entire entree stating that the biscuit didn't have enough honey and no butter provided, the mashed potato portion was puny and they were nothing impressive, and the 2 bites of coleslaw were bland.  Because we had a 50.00 gift card, we needed to order something else so we decided on the apple money bread dessert. We were told that it would take an extra 12 minutes, which we were fine with because we thought it would be something amazing. Not even close. What came out was a small dish of \"monkey bread\" (which resembled bread pudding) and a small bowl of vanilla ice cream atop cut out pieces of menu which we presumed to be pre-used due to the large grease stain on the one underneath the bowl of ice cream. The monkey bread was very disappointing as it was mostly apples, and the cinnamon/ sugar mixture appeared to be sprinkled atop after the dish was done baking. Additionally, there was a spice used in it (I think it was ginger) that was wayyyyy too prominent. It left a disgusting aftertaste in my mouth. The ice cream was fine but we were pretty sure it was Dreyers.  After finishing dessert, we waited and waited... and waited... only to wait some more. We had already let it slide that our waters were empty while eating dessert to which the waitress said she had several other tables seated so she was scrambling back and forth between them all. I found it interesting that she said this because the restaurant was practically empty. Anyways, as we sat waiting for the check, the hubby informed me that the delay was because she was sitting at a table with some obvious friends who had come in and basically just shooting the sh**. This really annoyed me. Normally, I am a patient person, but after having a crappy meal, I really just wanted to get home. I believe we waited for about 20 minutes just to get the check without her attempting to check on us during that time.  So to conclude, Culinary dropout was highly disappointing. Food was not great, service was crappy... This is one of the few instances where nothing impressed me and I see absolutely no reason to return to Culinary Dropout. I gave it 1 extra star because the food was not horrible, portion sizes were decent, and the decor was aesthetically pleasing. One last thought though: Maybe the chef should go back to culinary school to learn how to season chicken properly and perhaps learn the difference in pasta's?",

    "text": "no outside tables available on a Sat night so we opted for immediate seating indoors. The best way that I can describle the vibe is edgy. Conversation can be a bit challanging due to the noise level. Our waiter was very friendly anf enthusiastic. He was right on the money with the soft pretzels with cheese fondue. Amazing. Very creative menu. I tryed the gnocci with sausage and mushrooms. The gnocci were light and delicious but they were overwhelmed by too much sausage. I give an A for creativity and a C for execution. No drinks or deserts",

    "text": "When we were headed here our hosts described it as a place vampires might hang out. One look at the decor and you can see what they mean. The place is ensconced in purple velvet  By the time we arrived we'd already been on a tasting tour of Scottsdale and the surrounding area but we wanted to taste something on the CD menu. All I wanted was some vegetables! The husband suggested the Seared Tuna Salad ($14) with ginger vinaigrette, wasabi peas, and an assortment textural  and it was so good.  Totally hit the spot.  I'd eat that salad everyday.  I wanted to sample an interesting cocktail too so I perused the drink menu and discovered a gem. As a proud part-Peruvian seeing Pisco on a menu fluffs my feathers up. As a matter of fact my cousin proudly represents the brand Vinas de Oro Pisco.  Pisco, a strong colorless grape brandy is expertly processed turning out a libation that resembles a very smooth tequila in flavor and is the base for the drink. You add lemon, simple syrup, bitters and egg whites. It's refreshing and strong.  The Peruvian Press ($10) was a version of the more traditional Pisco Sour and it was delicious.  This is a sipping drink so take it slow.   In MN when we say custard we're most likely talking about the creamier, fattier version of ice cream not the more classic version that's the consistency of a thick pudding. We were surprised, but not disappointed, when we dug into the Salted Caramel Custard ($7). The house made caramel corn that poured out the top of this glass was obscenely good. It was buttery, flavorful and stick to your teeth fresh. After, getting through barricade of popcorny goodness we were greeted by silky smooth custard. It tasted like salted caramel for sure. Next time I'd the Caramel Corn ($3) and skip the custard.   I just sampled a bite of the Ricotta Gnocchi ($14) with sausage and mushrooms. The light, brothy creme sauce was perfectly seasoned. Delicious. I'd try it as a main course!",

    "text": "First time in Scottsdale and my friend took me here for lunch. Food was absolutely amazing!!  We split the Heirloom Tomatoes and the Strawberry Kale Salad with Salmon. The ambiance was great. Love the decor and vibe...even at lunch. The highlight, however, was Lukas...our server. Adorable, smart, accommodating, knowledgeable, brilliant all around!!  He is what made my friend come back and I would sit in his section if at all possible.  Also, try the pretzel buns and homemade chips. My friend was raving!",

We showed up at 7 on a Saturday, so we expected a wait, but we found a seat at the huge indoor/outdoor bar and had a few drinks while we waited. We loved the atmosphere and long tables & bench seating, other people were eating outside too. A band started playing at 9; the servers were very relaxed and casual but had great menu knowledge!! (which I always a good sign) SIDEBAR: they have a waiter who looks like a cross between Ricky Martin and The Situation. of COURSE we tried the pretzel fondue. Awesome. As well as the olives appetizer. I had the ahi tuna salad which was large and filling and my boyfriend had the ribs which he oogled they were better than Banderas haha. All in all, great time, will return!!",
