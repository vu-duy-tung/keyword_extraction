Who doesn't right?! Today we were here when the doors opened. We were sat immediately, which was good because the buns were calling my name! We got sat by the kitchen, wanted a little  less action so asked to be sat somewhere with less action. Back to the front we went, taken to the table right in front of the dancing line. Hmmm, not quite what we had in mind but somewhat satisfied. Ideally, less action would have been towards the back. Must have got mixed in translation. But since buns were in her hand we sat and shut up about it.",

Corn was drowned in pepper water, steamed broccoli was dripping with butter sauce, and the chicken was coated in plain bbq sauce....  To sum it up: Great staff. Bleh food.",

Daughter's 17th birthday, and they have tickets to a movie which they will most likely miss now all due to inept staff in charge of hostessing.  Update, spoke with manager after a group showed up after we did and were seated before us.  34 minutes after 7 pm table time and still no table.  Ok over 40 minutes late, the manager expadited our order,  gave us some apps, and was able to give us a chance to make the movie.  She even added to movie tickets.  Our server was awesome,  manager really stepped up. The inexperienced hostess staff still a problem though.   Thank you to management for saving our daughters birthday.",

Not tonight, we were welcomed with smiles, quickly sat, and waitress allowed us to order kids meal first, served and then the adults meals.  She never missed a step.  Every meal was really well prepared, eye pleasing and tasty.  The dancing of employees was so much fun and kept us cheerful.  I highly recommend this establishment.

Food came in good time even though they were packed. Was checked in on at appropriate time intervals. Two dudes posted up next to me at the bar, and I could tell the staff was on alert to make sure I wasn't bothered. Well oiled machine of a staff they got going on here! Keep it up.",

I was here about 2 weeks ago on a Friday night because I was craving fried catfish (yes in Phoenix) and some really good potatoes.  I yelped \"Catfish near 85016\".  Texas Roadhouse didn't come up with in the first 2 pages so I took my researching skills to Google :)  I know steakhouses usually have different kinds of fish options so I checked Outback Steakhouse first .. no catfish.  I checked Longhorn second ... no catfish.  Then it hit me \"Texas Roadhouse\".  I checked the menu out online, saw catfish listed, along with various options to dress my potato.  Win!!    Again .. it was a Friday night ... around 9ish.  There wasn't a wait at all but I sat at the bar anyway.  I decided not to drink and opted for freshly brewed peach sweet tea instead.  It was delicious!  I ordered a 3 piece catfish dinner with seasoned rice and a side salad.  It came out within 20 minutes, pippin' hot and oh so damn good!  The salad was a little on the Blah side but I did't care that much.  The other options for sides were green beans, sauteed apples, a sweet potato (loaded or not), regular potato (loaded or not), mashed potatoes, cole slaw and fries.  The catfish dinner was pretty big so I had plenty of leftovers to take home.   My boyfriend loved the leftovers so much he said .. Man .. We gotta go back tomorrow.  So we did :)  We went back to Texas Roadhouse the very next day and shared the 3 piece catfish dinner with a loaded sweet potato and seasoned rice to -go.  We live about 13 minutes away.  Everything was still so hot and fresh when we got home .. rolls included :)  Of course I'm a fan!",

One of the managers stopped by to check on us to ensure our (my) first experience at Texas Roadhouse was going well. Periodically the music was turned up and the waitstaff line danced, which was entertaining and kept the atmosphere light and fun. Everyone in my family enjoyed their meal and we had more than enough to take home as leftovers. Overall, the food was good, but the service made the meal. Thanks, Kaliyah!",

Hot chicks with great smiles. The bread is ridiculously hot & fresh. The beers were supersonic cold. Ribeye was juicy pink & tastey. The mushrooms were explosive. Sweat corn was nothing like I've ever imagined. The mash potatoes with the works was intense. It was an orgy of food. I'll be back!!!",

    "text": "I have experienced better than Texas Roadhouse.  I came here after a recommendation from one of my co-workers. We started off with the butter rolls which were delicious. They had a cinnamon butter which was decadent and very tasty. We got the Cactus Blossom for an appetizer which is very similar to a Bloomin' Onion from Outback, just not as big. The dipping sauce it came with was very good.  For an entree, I got a half slab of ribs with mashed potatoes and a cup of chili as my two sides. My partner got a 6 OZ sirloin steak with the same two sides.  The ribs were disappointing. You can tell that they are reheated and they become overcooked because of this. They are not fall of the bone as they say they are, you really have to pull those ribs apart and when you do, the meat is stringy and chewy. I had to pick apart the ribs and I only ate the parts that were not overcooked. The mashed potatoes were not my favorite, I had maybe two spoonfuls of it.  My partner's steak was cooked well, but it was nothing to write home about. It was still a little chewy although he got medium rare and we had to use the steak sauce that's on the table to give it some flavor.  Our cup of chili never came, so we asked to get it to go and our server was kind enough to give us our appetizer for free.   I am not sure if we came to the wrong Texas Roadhouse at the wrong time, but we were not impressed, and a little bit disappointed towards the end. I don't think we will be giving this place a shot any time soon.",

I ordered a filet MR and the first time it came out it was cold and MW. I waited about 25 minutes for the first one. When i sent it back it took another 25 minutes for the second one. The second one was cold and brown as well!... unbelievable. I called the front house manager to relay my experience and she said \"do you want me to take your steak?\"  So after waiting for an hour.. she took my steak and threw it out and took it off my check. ZERO customer service. I went across the street to Chillies since I was starving. My food came out in 10 minutes.  What a waist of time and an embarrassment to Texas Roadhouse. I hope they address their issues of not being able to cook a steak at a steakhouse as well as their horrible management.",

I had a sirloin, sweet potato and cooked carrots in lemon sauce. The veggie was the servers recommendation.  I got my steak med well, which they classify as pink in the middle. The steak was grey it was so cooked...almost like it was microwaved. The carrots on the other hand were not cooked and no lemon sauce in sight.  My husband and uncle like their food and our server was great, so a star for each of those.  Maybe lunch people get left overs.",

    "text": "This was my first time to visit the Texas Roadhouse, Metro Center. It will definitely be my last. There were 11 of us and they seated us in 2 booths. They never even pulled the extensions out until someone asked. One of our party did not get served until everyone had finished. My ribs were terrible. You needed a saw to cut the pork. I complained and they brought me the exact same thing the second time. The manager came over and a whole $2.00 was taken off a $20+ check. I ended up paying $26 with tip for one rib and 1/2 of a sweet potato with way to much brown sugar on it. One in the party started to get sick before we left the restaurant. He had fish and shared it with one of the girls who went home with cramps, vomiting and diarrhea that lasted 3 hours. One in the party had to get up in the middle of the night for pepto bismo. All in all it turned out to be a nightmare for most of us. If the management had been half way decent about it I might have given them a second chance, but now no way. I had heard so many good things about the chain but this metro center one is terrible in my opinion. Food way beyond bad. It is such a shame that no one seemed to care about the bad service and terrible food.  I have to say the girls that greeted us in the front were great. The dinner rolls were wonderful.",

I didn't eat the rolls as I had already reached my carb limit for the day as far as bread goes. That didn't stop me from ordering a 11 Oz.

We both enjoyed our meals with no complaints at all. Came out in a timely fashion, our server was great, we left a higher than normal tip for her. We were surprised to see our bill was only $41 so you know we will be back.

After we sat, we were given the wonderful bread and butter, but no napkin or silverware..? Server took our drink order, came back with drinks, took our food order, came back with food. Still no silverware or napkin. Im well aware that the server didnt notice the lack of the things we needed because he was too busy cleaning up his section for the night. (we went in at 9 and they closed at 11). Wiping menus, wiping down tables, refilling the peanuts... I dont even work there and I was learning closing sidework... Lets just say he made it perfectly clear we were his last table of the night. SO! After our food had sat there for a minute, while we were waiting for our napkins and silverware, my boyfriend finally cut in to his MEDIUM paper thin meat patty of a \"burger\", and it was raw. The inside was literally RAW. Not rare, but RAW. Our server was sitting in the booth behind us wiping menus so it was easy to get a hold of him. His response was \"let me get a plate for the burger.. cause there's nothing wrong with your fries, right?\"... As I sat there forcing down my God awful sloppy chicken sandwich alone, 10min later a short chubby manager with a hat on approached the table like we had just egged his car out front. He slams the burger on the table and says \"wanna take a bite out of it to make sure you like it this time?\"... WTF?! No appology, not even a smile?!! My boyfriend forced a bite down and said it was fine. The manager knodded and walked away. Sure enough the burger was RAW AGAIN. I set my card on the edge of the table... the server saw that my bf only took the one bite, he came back with the closed check and needless to say, we were still charged for the burger. Horrible food, terrible service and management... we'll never be back again.",

It was a bit of an overkill.  And the place is loud. Very Loud.  So loud it is hard to hear your table companions.  And every so often, the music would go up a little louder, and all the employees would stop making sure every single customer felt welcome and aprreciated all the time, and they all did a cute little line dance.Other than that, the place is great.  Nice atmosphere, great peanuts.  The food is reasonably priced and so very tasty.  I am sure they know this, because they are constantly asking how your meal is.  Well, not constantly, but pretty darn close.  I had the T-Bone smothered in Mushrooms, and it was cooked to perfection.  The rice side dish was a little sticky and over-cooked, but other than that, the food was an 9 out of ten.    After we paid the bill and started to the door, again the service was overwhelming when no less than four seperate employess thanked us for coming and hoped we enjoyed our meal.  The place was packed, but still seemed a little over staffed.  I do like to feel welcome in a resturant, but not every time I turn around.  Still, I think I will be returning for a good, resonably priced meal.",

This is this place where you eat all the peanuts you want at the table and throw the shells on the ground!  The service is usually always great, but once in awhile something lacks but the management always seems to handle it. To start I love the rolls, so good. I usually end up getting the prime rib or the steak kabobs, which are always delicious. I love the kabobs because you get a skewer of grilled veggies as well.   Everything is homemade there in the store so is always fresh.",

When I've dined here in the past and had less than a stellar meal (which is very rare, considering how often I visit), she has made sure to make everything right again! Tonight while I was dining, she made the extra effort to make a little girl smile and even invited her to dance with the staff! It was really awesome to watch! She is one of the most amazing managers I have encountered in as long as I can remember! Another great thing about tonight's experience was our server, Desiree! Even though we practically closed the restaurant down, she was smiling and kind the whole night! She was very attentive and we never had to ask for a refill or wonder where she was! I've worked in restaurants before, and Desiree certainly has figured out how to be amazing! Anyways, major props to the both of them, and the whole team at this location! Never have I ever left dissatisfied (or hungry haha)! This place is my favorite, thanks to the amazing staff and wonderful food!!!",

    "text": "Never going to eat here again. Planned a nice birthday dinner for a party of 16. Knowing they don't do reservations, we called.early in the day and asked about when we should call.ahead. we were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftold.call.at&s=482ffc3a49227659219f521a268d05293309987b07aa5d7eb6b2ffe97f515ace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">told.call.at</a> 4:30 for a 6:30 time. We called and got on the list and we're told, see you at 6:30. Knowing that we still needed to arrive early, we checked in at 6:20 with 10 of the 16 present  and we're told  it would be 15 mins or so. After waiting about 10 mins we checked in the status. Still had to wait. Keep in mind there is no waiting area and only a few benches outside with what looked like 100 people waiting. Waited about 10.mins more and asked again. This time they said the party was done eating at the table there were just waiting for <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthem.to&s=f17eb595063bcdd30ec1223ecacb9249c03f1191d24698b9c944d572e1a517a2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">them.to</a> leave. They could sit is back to back or across an Isle  if we wanted quicker seating but said maybe another 10 mins. I was like I called 2 hours ago to get the long table so we would.wait. another 15 mins goes by and we are starving. We have been getting bumped into by staff and customers because there is no.where to stand. My husband goes to get some peanuts after they finally filled the bin and was almost body-checked by a staff member retreating peanuts for a table. He was like hey watch out and was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbarked.at&s=a52122847385e446d00478b072fdf25ab4ac9ff2d5941152dde4792380fed350\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">barked.at</a> by the server. He went to ask.about the table again. Now 45 mins after the time we asked about and the peach of a manager, Kelly, asked what the problem was. He said we had a reservation, which he didn't really know the call ahead thing and was quickly told they don't make reservations in a condescending manner and at any rate told the man we had been waiting a very long time.for calling so far in advance. He also mentioned the rude incident with the peanuts.  Next thing I know my husband walls out and says we can't eat there. The manager was no longer going to swat us because we were harassing his hostess! Seriously, asking about a wait is harassment? I was so embarrassed. What was I going to do with 16 people on a Friday night after we waited nearly an hour  already to be seated. I told the pager inside and he smirked and told name to have a nice night! Really, this was my birthday dinner. Thanks for ruining it.  I will.never eat here again.  UPDATE: I called customer service and they had the owner contact me about the situation.  Ultimately he apologized and asked me to please have dinner for my family on him at one of his other restaurants. I agreed and waited about 2 weeks to get the vouchers.  Keep in mind the manager turned away 16 of us!  I got 2 vouchers for dinner for 2 up to $30 value.  That's all good but I have 5 people in my family and so now I have to decide who gets to go, or pay money to eat a meal that is supposed to be comped as a gesture!  And what about the other 12 people who were with us that night, my elderly parents, my brother and his family, my nephew and his wife.  They still all experienced the same thing as I did. Oh and what about my free birthday appetizer, guess I don't get that either!  Still not happy but I guess they \"tried\"",

She took such awesome care of us I don't know how to thank her enough. Her service was timely and flawless! Christin is such a treasure to the Texas Roadhouse crew the GIRL needs a raise, promotion, and some serious recognition from the top dogs. Her energy is fantastic, and you can tell she has a real passion for her job! She kept us happy, hydrated, and entertained the whole time. She even invited us to dance along with the servers and taught us all the right moves so we did not look to ridiculous. She also has a very fun and classy way of totally embarrassing you on your birthday when she brings her crew and the birthday saddle out. Christin is defiantly a gem! Food was wonderful as always but it is always nice to get excellent Service  too! I had the sirloin with a Cesar salad and loaded potatoes, wail my boyfriend had the catfish with rice and corn, his brother had the chili and mom ate the California chicken with a loaded sweet potato! Let's just say all of us happily cleaned our plates! Delicious and so yummy! Beer was ice cold and refreshing! Hostess were also very friendly. All around must go to place! What's better then delicious food, outstanding service, fun atmosphere, great drinks, loud music, and good times! Again shout out to Christin keep up the impeccable service!",

We waited a long time for food, drinks, and refills. I asked about 5-6 times for some bread before he brought any.   Food was only okay.  I ordered pulled pork dinner and it was tasty, but kinda dry, wife and son said same thing about the ribs, very dry, my wife had to ask for more BBQ sauce.  Oldest son had cheeseburger, and he seemed satisfied, but youngest son ad sliders and took one bite and wouldn't eat them saying they were nasty. He's 4, so take that as you will.  It was my middle sons birthday, we let the server know and they brought out a saddle and Sunday and announced it was his birthday and for everyone to give a bid loud yeee haaw.

Settin' some pretty lofty expectations...    Well, she was not bs'ing... she's legitimately the best... not just at this Texas Roadhouse or even the chain... she may literally be the best at what she does universally.  She's the nexus of energy, hospitality (like Mom makes you feel) and entertainment (she's the person you wanna hang with in Vegas).  Ridiculously great service aside,  the rest of the experience was solid.   Pork Chops were nicely done.  Ribs were literally falling off the bone.    Drinks (margarita & Kenny's cooler) were decent but a bit sweet (though what should I expect when I order a blue cocktail?).  It's been a while since we hit a Texas Roadhouse.   I almost forgot what a great place it is for a casual dinner.  There was one slight oddity this evening.  For one reason or another, there was an awkward, sullen young lady (looked at least a few years too old to be a Girl Scout).  drifting thru the restaurant carrying a vendor box (you know, like how they sell cookies and popcorn at a ballgame?) full of Girl Scout cookies that read only \"We Accept Visa / MasterCard\" across the front.   It had a pink fun noodle around the strap (ostensibly to provide some padding for her neck).     It is that time of year and obviously she was there to sell cookies, but all she did was walk around aisles of the restaurant - not a word, a smile, or even eye contact.  Basically, a Zombie.   After the fifth time she passed by, it was kinda creepy.   This went on the whole hour we were there.   She must have floated by like 15 times.    Then, as we left, what I think was her partner was sitting outside in the bed of a truck right outside the door.   At least he was selling as you might expect...    It clearly wasn't a restaurant-supported charity thing (not a mention from staff).  It's like the management just them set up shop.   Just odd.",

    "text": "First off, before I get into the \"bad\" part about our visit, I'd like to discuss the \"good\" part of our visit at this Texas Roadhouse location.   Our server, Gage, great guy! Great personality, energy, and attentiveness. He's the only reason why I'll give 2 stars.   The evening of 2/15/2018, the House was packed - seriously packed. No biggie. We weren't in a rush, we were there to enjoy our evening dining in for dinner. The wait to get a booth was approximately 30 minutes, not bad in my opinion - considering how packed it was.  There was a Girl Scouts walking around the establishment for hours hustling cookies, while her father was out in his truck hustling cookies. Not bad in my opinion, but on the other hand, people came to enjoy their evening - not to have someone constantly pass their table with crates of cookies.  Anyways... what we ordered:   Appetizer: Blossom Onion - had to request to have it fried to a crisp/fully cooked. When I ordered one back in January of this year, it was undercooked and doughy/gooey at the base.   Beverages: One strawberry lemonade and one raspberry lemonade   My Entree: Chicken fried chicken (no gravy) with loaded mashed potatoes, and green beans.   My fiance's entree: Chicken fried chicken (smothered in white gravy), loaded mashed potatoes, and seasoned rice.   When our food was finally served to our table, our server (Gage) apologized for the amount of time it took and asked us to make sure that our food was hot and fully cooked. Fully cooked? I was a little taken back by his comment, because shouldn't it be fully cooked? Anyways, it was one of those things that just flew over my head because I'm like, of course it's fully cooked, right?? I'm my opinion, why else would it have taken about 30 minutes for the food to get served?   (We requested plastic to-go utensils to eat with, because two forks had old crusted food on them. I should've snapped a picture, but didn't)  So, we're eating and laughing - just enjoying our night. We finish, the bill comes, we pay (and tip, of course), and accepted two lemonades to go.   About an hour and a half to two hours into being at home... BOOM!! Sudden head pain, stomach pain, nausea and gagging. Followed by non stop vomiting and diarrhea. Signs of food poisoning? DEFINITELY!! My lady had been food poisoned. My stomach is also upset at this point and I was feeling a bit woozy.   Focusing on her not feeling well all night, I didn't even bother calling the establishment until the next morning (2/16). I requested to speak with the manager and/or GM, so the young gal connected me with the kitchen manager - who then later identified himself as the owner.   He told me that his name is Carrie (not sure if I spelled it correctly) and that he was the owner. I started to tell him about our experience, about our server and how kind he was, as well as the food poisoning situation.   It was almost as if he got offended by me calling to report being food poisoned at his establishment, and was bothered by the server telling us to make sure it was cooked fully. He TRIED to dismiss it and hinted that it was the flu (Haha! Negative, she had the flu in January. TRY AGAIN!), he hinted that she was food poisoned elsewhere a while ago and it just caught up to her (oh yeah, sure, 1-2 hours after eating in your restaurant). On top of that - we are frequent cooks at home and don't eat at restaurants often.  He had no other excuses to give to dismiss my concern. He pointed out how no one else has complained of getting food poisoning, and they sold 70ish chicken fried chickens that night. He just tried to downplay my feelings and concerns altogether. At the end, he called himself trying to offer us free food or whatever. Umm, negative! We will not be eating there ever again, but thanks. I politely declined and told him that I would rather be refunded, but the server can keep his tip (cause he was great).   The bill (before the tip) was $40.11, but he only agreed to refund $21.98 - a slap in the face in my opinion. He could've refunded the entire $40.11, but he didn't because he was defensive and thought we were just \"crying wolf\". Speaking with him was just \"ugh\", but I'll be sure to let all of the Texas Roadhouse frequent fliers that I know, know about our experience.",

Also, if you are having house salad, the honey lime dressing is the best!",

The waiter was fun and during dinner there was a fun line dance that the waiters did in the middle of the isle. Also a booth near us was celebrating a birthday and they brought a fun little saddle for the guest to sit on and we all did a Ye-ha for him.  We left super full with a lot of leftovers for tomorrow. We started with complementary rolls and ordered blooming onion and fried pickles. We happen to be their during an early bird special and picked from a bunch of choices for $9.99. Super fun and yummy place.",

The bartender Shanell was awesome. I ordered sirloin and ribs, but was told they were out of ribs. So I changed my order to a filet, medium rare with fries as a side. When my filet came out after waiting 45 minutes. The steak was well done. A filet should not be well done. I asked the bartender if she placed the temperature for my steak at medium rare and she replied yes. I sent the steak back and was offered another, in which I declined. When the check came the manager on took money off for the steak, but still charged me for the fries. I left hungry and still had to pay for the French fries.   The manager knew that I was upset, but did nothing to make it right.",

This was a planned visit during my baseball/NASCAR weekend so we stopped in here after the baseball game. We started with the fried pickles (as I always do) and a cold Budweiser (as I always do).  Really having a good time here: Celebrating my Padres winning their ST game, watching my Tar Heels win the ACC tourney, watching the waiter-waitresses dance, and converting one young lady from being a Jeff Gordon fan to a Kevin Harvick fan.  Oh....the food. Well, I had the pulled pork which was delicious (as always) and the wife had the country fried steak. I tried hers and it was one of the better ones I've had in years anywhere.   I think you really have to be a fan of this kind of establishment to really enjoy it. If your'e a \"foodie\" then you probably don't like chains anyway so this might not be you're cup of tea.  If you're redneck like me, you'll love it.",

She was 100% AWESOME. Her food and drink suggestions were spot on, and she had a great attitude. Now for the food. OMG...1000% better than the night before. The steak was perfect and the fall off the bone ribs were unmatched. This was one of the best dinners we have ever had. While the food was absolutely delicious, I generally care more about service.

I ordered an 11oz sirloin Medium-Rare and it's has a sliver of medium on top where it has the grill marks but it's rare from the middle down where there are absolutely no grill marks to be seen.   They no longer wait for you to cut into your steak to see if it's to your liking. Drop and run. Well, I guess it's a done for us coming to this establishment. :(  P.S. I guess our waitress Desiree wants us out. She dropped the check off. No asking if we want dessert, no saying I'll be your cashier when you are ready, no take your time. Just another drop and run.

    "text": "I found myself (alone) searching for somewhere to grab lunch, in a town I'm not familiar with and while my phone was dying. We have Texas Roadhouse in my town (Boise, ID) but I have yet to try it, so I figured I would give it a shot.   When I walked in, they were in the middle of a line dance. I love this kind of atmosphere! I was seated quickly (after they were done dancing) and my waitress welcomed me shortly after. I let her know I had never been in, so she sat down at my table and went over the menu with me - which I appreciated.  The hostess brought rolls and butter when she seated me, so I went ahead and dove in while I was pondering the menu. The cinnamon butter was a great touch, and was perfectly sweet. I could tell the rolls would be good.. If mine hasn't been overlooked. The tops were brown and hard. Frankly, I was surprised they served them. But, I peeled off the top and went with it. What was left was airy, slightly sweet, and perfectly carb-a-liscious.   I went with a favorite of mine - Country Fried Chicken and cream gravy, with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and apple sauce. (I find it neat you can order applesauce as a side!) My waitress asked if I wanted the steak topped with anything, so of course I went with sauteed onions!   When my food finally came, I realized my eyes had been much bigger than my stomach. Very big portions!   The chicken was okay, but the breaking kept falling off and the chicken itself was bland. The breaking was okay. The gravy was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. And the onions... Oh the onions. First off, I'm an onion lover! But there had to be nearly a whole onion on top of my dish, which was over the top and left the dish filled with the taste of onion (rather than complimenting it). Second, the onions weren't nearly sauteed enough. More than half of them were still perfectly white and crunchy. I was not pleased to find nearly raw onions overbearing my dish.   The mashed potatoes were really good, along with the toppings, but they could have scaled it back with the cheese. I couldn't see anything under the yellow/orange blockade, so my first bit was nearly all butter.   The applesauce was okay, but clearly just something out of a jar. I was actually expecting homemade. (And would have loved for it to have been hot.)   My strawberry lemonade was okay, but was just some syrup mixed with fountain lemonade. Would have loved to see real strawberries.   Maybe I'm picky when it comes to places like this, but I was spoiled to grow up going to The Original Roadhouse in Salem, Oregon - which blows this place out of the water.   I don't plan on checking out my local one anytime soon.",

The steak was tender and delicious. I ordered green beans as a side which were really good. I also ordered a house salad. The reason for the three star review is that the food took a while to come out and the salad arrived after the meal.",

It is the most perfect smooth and fluffy cinnamon honey butter on the planet. In addition, they give you a bucket full of peanuts. Then you order a starter or whatever it is you want off the menu. I always like to get a baked potatoe, mashed potatoes with gravy, and grilled shrimp with rice. In conclusion, Texas Roadhouse is where anyone can get a great meal and have a good time all for a good price.",

Poor customer service is a result of a poor hiring process which is clearly a reflection on management here. Well in this case a reflection on the owner.

It's noisy, there are peanut shells on the floor, there is almost always a wait but don't forget your are getting a steak dinner for under 10 bucks.. The people who work there are very friendly and they give great service...They have feeding a lot of people at a very friendly price down to a science.. I go away for the summer to a place where there is no Texas Roadhouse and I really miss having them nearby..  If you don't like to wait, there is almost always a seat at the bar, which is where I almost always eat. There is an advantage to this, they put their best people behind the bar so you get great service. This is not a place where drunks go to drink, and most people at the bar are there to eat.",

They food was delicious and the bar area was plenty of fun with the televisions playing multiple channels. The wait time on a Friday night was almost an hour but it was well worth it. The steak was delicious and cooked exactly to my liking. The price wasn't that bad either. It was very equivalent to any other restaurant since you are getting meat. The fresh peanuts that are given and around the restaurant was pretty cool because you can eat them and toss the shells. The employees did a dance performance to a song a couple times during the few hours I was there. They were entertaining and even invited customers to join in on their dance performance. Overall, I would recommend going there to anyone who wanted to try a new restaurant. I will definitely visit again the next time I am back in town.",

I mentioned \"the steak should taste like sex\" to my buddy. To which a waitress went back to the \"owner\" and said I was making explicit comments to her. The \"owner\" came out and threatened to call the cops on me for mentioning sex. dude this is easily the worst Texas Roadhouse I have ever been to. To not be able to make a comment and have it taken lightly by the waitress is garbage. This guy was a chump who called the cops threatening me. I was in no way out of my realm to say what I said to my own friend in a personal gathering. I was well within my limits to say what I said without reprimand of police. I tried to say their steak was great and this cock monkey tried to come at me. Fuck this place and what it stands for.",

I would recommend coming on a day you know isn't busy. because to me it seems they can't handle the high volume of people that come in. Our server the past couple times has been Thaddeus, and he has been extremely inadequate. He is consistently overbearing, yet he fails to keep up simple table maintenance, such as refills. (I had to ask for a refill twice, and after asking the second time he brought me the wrong soda). Additionally, our food took over 40 minutes (for one steak we shared), and our server simply said it was because there were so many large parties. In a perfect world, the management would be more aware of the server's shortcomings and the timing of the kitchen, and maybe could have offered much better consolation than Thaddeus could ever provide.",

    "text": "@ Texas Roadhouse we were swiftly greeted and seated by the lovely ladies @ the front and Thaddeus--our waiter--matched the ideal sweet spot serving style to a T. (Not rushing nor lacking) He was very attentive, warm, and charming--so if he was having a bad day he certainly didn't come across that way ! I drank a strawberry lemonade, and started off with a house salad as my first side. The salad is full of goodies and the buttermilk ranch is KILLER good. For my entree, I ate the chicken fried chicken with my second side being the mashed taters'. My chicken was served tender, and fried to a crispy golden-brown on the outside + my mashed potatoes where whipped well. I topped both with their white gravy, which has a slightly sweet taste to it. (Hey, I'm not complaining.) My dad drank a Coke and ordered the road kill, sans cheese, with the mash and a salad too. Something to note about the food--although it is an atmospheric place with a tasty menu, it doesn't REALLY live up to the name. If you've just moved from the Lone Star State and you're looking for a taste of home, try TEXAZ grill on Bethany. (they've been open 35 years !) Pops' told Thaddeus it had been my birthday the day before and he STILL gave me a free dish of vanilla ice cream topped with a chocolate drizzle @ the end (even though I didn't come in on the actual day) how sweet ! All in all, the ULTIMATE  \"star of the show\" for me had to have been the warm, freshly baked bread basket served @ the beginning of our meal with a side of their classic cinnamon honey butter. Can't find anything quite like it elsewhere. By the way, if you ask, they'll give you a bag of free peanuts to take home with you ! I've been here more than once and never had any quarrels, so it's a THUMBS UP from this girl. Oh and hey, thanks for reading!  P.s sound sensitive customers may not like this place too much--IT'S LIVELY & NOISY !!!",

    "text": "PORK SOAKED VEGETABLES!  Now, I'm sure I know what you're thinking, don't eat at a steak house if you're vegetarian but I've done it many times over the years and been completely satisfied since other restaurants are honest about what's in their food. This joint has an item on the menu for vegetarians to pick 4 sides to create a meal, what they fail to mention is all their sides contain animal products.   They cook their baked and sweet potatoes in bacon fat, their mashed potatoes and rice contain chicken broth, even their green beans have pieces of pork in them.  To offer a entree of four side dishes for non-meat eaters is an awesome thing for a steakhouse to do, but to have all those sides contain meat is disgusting. If I hadn't inquired about the potatoes I would have never known until I was throwing up that evening from eating hidden meat products.   The ONLY reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because they were accommodating enough to microwave a potato for me. I ordered the salad without animal (wasn't washed), I asked for steamed veggies (raw) and fries (horrible choice but what can ya do?)  My boyfriend's steak was supposed to be medium rare, it was well done and no thicker than your finger. The 11 year old with us ordered medium well, hers was borderline raw.   Even the meat eaters in our group were unsatisfied. We will never be back!!!",

    "text": "Decided to give this location another try a several times after my last post. I can honestly say that I am truly done with this location. I still like Texas Roadhouse I just won't be visiting this location again. The \"Owner\" Kerry is a prick and does not care about his customers. During our last visit which was late March 2016 my wife started choking and vomiting while eating her prime rib. We did our best not to make a scene as we didn't want to gross the other patrons out. My son even almost vomited (normal reaction when you see someone else vomit). We didn't mention anything to anyone other than the server that the peanuts container needed to be discarded because of my wife vomiting in it. Afterwards, we took my wife to the ER because some of the meat was still lodged in her esophagus. Basically, she could still breathe and function but she couldn't drink or hold anything down as there was the blockage. Our family friend when she found out called Texas Roadhouse and explained to the \"owner\" what had happened and that since my wife and I were loyal customers as we go to Texas Roadhouse at least once a month if not twice a month for dinner passing up several streak houses along the way that it would be nice if Texas Roadhouse comped a meal for us. Keep in mind I did not know or expect that my friend called the restaurant on our behalf. She simply texted me and told me she called the owner Kerry and he wanted us to call him when she my wife was okay. Well my wife was stable and in the care of the ER department so I decided to call the owner Kerry. After waiting over 10 minutes on hold he finally gets on the phone and I tell him who I was. I told him that I was calling him because my friend had said that he asked us to call. While I was talking to Kerry I could not believe how uncaring and how such a prick he was. He said how is it his (Texas Roadhouse) responsibility for what happened. I told him we weren't looking for a hand out (complimentary meal) that I was simply calling him back per his request. I explained to him and out of respect of other customers we kept the commotion down as to not gross out the other nearby customers. Kerry was such a prick and not empathetic at all. His attitude over the phone came across that he didn't care and that I was simply bothering him. So now it is my mission that others know how the owner at this location does not care about his customers. This location is the not best at customer service anyways at least not consistently. We simply over all of our visits since this location opened chose to ignore the poor customer service, routinely having to send our meat back to be cooked the way we asked for it to be the first time. We still chose to give our business despite Black Angus having much better tasting steak and Long Horns both located next door having much better customer service. I sent an email regarding my complaint and the general manager called me back and left a voicemail asking me to call him back but I didn't bother because I am done with this location. After posting my experience on social media I will be letting corporate know as well.",

Service staff was friendly, welcoming and provided excellent service. Our visit here was my wife's first time at a Texas Roadhouse, and the peanut shells on the floor was not a pleasant surprise for her (OCD slightly), but she said the butter alone was worth tolerating the floors, from her that's an amazing compliment! Lol all in all this was the end to a great date night and I highly recommend this location to anyone who wants a perfectly cooked steak with fantastic service!",

The chicken tenders were about the same quality as Chilies. And their Country Fried chicken and gravy was just low grade. And if you go anyway DO NOT GET THE RICE!! It taste like your just eating sodium. Nasty nasty sodium. As my husband put it \"I can taste the box!\"  So yes if your going to choose a stake house for dinner just go to a real steak house. YOu will pay a $3.00 difference for MUCH BETTER FOOD.  Outback, Lonestar, Long Horn. All much MUCH better",

We had refills on the table before we needed them & she even brought a kids refill for our little one - can't remember the last time that happened, oh wait - that's never happened with out asking. Definitely deserving of the bigger than normal tip we left. The food was prepared to perfection.

We went there Sunday afternoon with a party of 5.  Besides waiting forever for our food, we experienced a whole series of issues with the food itself.   1.  My son ordered a steak with Au Jus and chili.  They brought the Au Jus with the chili which was delivered with the salads.  Of course it was cold when the steak finally arrived. 2.  My son ordered his steak medium.  HIs steak was well done.  We sent it back and they brought back a pretty rare steak (probably didn't want to waste another piece of meat). 3.  I had their pick 4 salad entree.  Interestingly, chili is one of the options.  I asked for a bowl of chili and told the waitress that I wanted to put the chili over a plain baked potato.  The chili came with the salad, not the baked potato ... (which arrived 20 or more minutes later). 4.  My wife had the chicken salad.  She's had it at other Texas Roadhouse locations.  It wasn't as good here.    Service was ok, but the waitress pretty much just took our order and left.  We've had much better and more engaged servers at both the 75th Ave and Goodyear locations.  Bottom line ... we won't be back to this location.",

The service was fine, but I can get that at McDonalds. What I came for was a steak. I ordered a rib eye, blackened, medium rare. What I got was blackened all right, but not how it is normally prepared. Blackened steaks are seasoned, then seared to order. This steak was basically Pittsburgh style, charred to a crisp, and raw in the middle. I actually like Pittsburgh style steaks, but this was over the top. Like eating a raw steak coated with charcoal.  Stick with the basics here and you'll probably be just underwhelmed instead of utterly disappointed.",

Seated within 10 minutes and waited about that long for a server. All good, we were in no hurry and just wanted the night out. Waited about 15 minutes for our steaks to arrive which were wrong. We both ordered the sirloins and I was given a ribeye. Not a problem I must have grabbed the wrong plate. All the managers stopped by to apologize and reassured me they were on it and my steak would be out. Another 15 minutes (my partner is now done with dinner) my steak arrives. Now he watches me eat as I watched him eat. Would have been cool to have gotten a drink refill but couldn't find the server again. Finally done with the meal and presented with checks for both meals. Now in all fairness the restaurant did comp my steak and just charged me for my soda. I paid the bill without issue or protest and we left. Just not the relaxing night out we expected and deserved after a long week. I understand low margins in the restaurant industry but let's be real this was not my mistake and the hurry, rushed remake order took another 15 minutes. Nah, just not quite what I would expect from this group and past experience with the organization. However, luckily for us there are two additional steakhouses literally beside this one and another chain down the street. We will try them for future nights out and see how that goes. Probably be a while before we go back to this one.",

Our server arrived with the drinks and offered no apology or greeting, just a \"it was water right?\" Throughout ordering, it was rushed and we couldn't even finished saying what we wanted before being interrupted by him. Our food orders were correct and our meals were great. We didn't see our server again until it was ready to drop check. We saw more of him when he wanted us to leave and cash out. We were seriously so excited to enjoy our dinner and it was severely dampened by terrible or the lack of service at that. From one server to another, this server needs some serious training.",

When we do have issues it's always the same stuff- cold baked potatoes and day old brownish lettuce in the house salad. It would be awesome if those happened less, but we'll still be back.",

I understand this is a steakhouse but close to NO vegan options, almost everything had a dairy content. The steak was poor quality.

    "text": "Let me first say that I love Texas Roadhouse and their food and even wrote a 5 star review several months ago at this particular Texas Roadhouse for the service, the food, etc. But this was my first time ordering food to go and I was NOT impressed at all. I ordered online which seems to be the way most restaurants are going these days, training us to do so rather than call in and talk to someone, thus perhaps eliminating a position or two. I had trouble with getting my credit card to take to pay for the order and it took me several minutes to get that sorted out. I specified a time for the order to be ready (6:40 p.m.) and had started the order shortly after 6 p.m., finishing up about 6:15 p.m. I got to the restaurant right around 6:40 p.m. and the place is packed. Unlike a lot of restaurants that we order from, there is NO (that I could find) parking spaces designated for those picking up food to go so I had to circle the parking lot a bit until I could find someone leaving so I could park. I got inside the restaurant and figured out where I had to go to pick up the food. The employee was friendly and said that it would be a few minutes for it to be completed. Long story short, the few minutes actually took about 20 minutes and I didn't leave the restaurant until close to 7:09 p.m. About 25 minutes after the promised time of 6:40 when I had ordered online. The employee working the order desk did update me a few times that the order was being worked on \"they were waiting on the vegetables\" and I appreciated that, but I DID NOT appreciate waiting that long after the time promised on their web site. Now I have to say that I did order the fresh veggies without the lemon butter and perhaps that slowed down things but that was never conveyed to me in why it took SOOOOO long to get the food out. When I got home with the food, the veggies were hot, but the other food (shrimp and steak) were warm close to lukewarm. They still tasted okay, but not as good as they would have been if we got them in the restaurant. I will preface it like I said in the beginning of my review. I love Texas Roadhouse but I will also say I will NEVER EVER order food online to go from them again. Terribly disappointed.",

    "text": "Oh what to say about Texas Roadhouse? I mean,  listen...if you don't know what you're getting yourself into by going to Texas Roadhouse, then you probably deserve to be shocked and appalled by your experience here. However, most people know the general idea of da Roadhouse: moderately priced steak and BBQ with a very...relaxed atmosphere that would make a person with a peanut allergy go into anaphylactic shock. That being said, being a casual restaurant does not mean that your service should lag.  We came here for dinner because a couple friends were digging it.  Peanut shells aside (like I said that's their gimmick, so cool), the line-dancing thing is cool for the kids, but I found that it actually made it so that servers were even more distracted from their customers than they were to begin with with such a busy restaurant. Again, I totally get being super busy and forgetting things your customers ask for, but it seemed like everything was awry, from the kitchen to the actual dining area.  My steak was ordered medium and my friend's steak was ordered well done; however, when we received our meals, the steaks were switched.  In addition, each of us ordered salads, which came out last (very odd, no matter where you are).   Food was good--like I said, da Roadhouse does a fine job, as long as you know what you're getting yourself into. Don't come here expecting Fleming's. Anywho, you guys, I wouldn't recommend this place for a number of reasons that won't really interest the typical clientele of da Roadhouse. Too busy and lacking in basic common sense when it comes to customer service. Plus, I was not feeling the fact that their green beans automatically come with bacon on them. Yo, if you are going to put bacon on something, tell your customers.   Keep on keepin' on, Roadhouse customers...but don't come here if you want to get what you ordered in any kind of punctual manner. Holla.",

My rib eye  was made as ordered (medium), the service was excellent, and I left satisfied with the overall experience.   The ambience is loud and festive, however I easily could carry a conversation. It's a great place for young people, people with kids, or other loud talking adults. The Christmas decorations were fun, spirited, and did not take away from the Texas Roadhouse theme.  The service was friendly and prompt. They danced around for someone's birthday and they seemed to enjoy their job, which is hard to find these days.  The food was yummy and I enjoyed my rib eye, mashed potatoes, and Cesar salad. The dressing is apparently made in house, tasted good. Next time I would ask if they could add tomatoes to the Caesar though. They give complimentary bread and peanuts.   This isn't a fancy, organic Kobe beef upscale steakhouse. It's a solid family joint and if you know what to order you will have a good time. The first time I came here I ordered smothered chicken and so I'd suggest you stay away from that! Also, I was in a rather calm mood and was not having the loud noise. Make sure you're up for the steak and a festive time, otherwise you may not have the optimal experience provided.",

Sirloin is tricky because it's so lean, but they cooked it to a perfect medium and it still had plenty of juice.  The grilled shrimp were amazing and were slathered in garlic butter.  The meal came with two sides, I chose a bowl of chili and a loaded baked potato.  The chili was in the Texas style, spicy and without beans, and was a good starter.  The loaded baked potato was good (kudos for the crusting of kosher salt on the skin) but I was too full from the rest of the food to finish it.  The staff was very nice and on top of things.",

I heard our perky really nice young 20 year old waitress tell a customer that she couldn't give her something she needed because the company required that they dance. That's strange. Sure it's fun but maybe they need to hire dancers to line dance instead of making staff stop their serving to dance for five minutes. Food can get cold and waters will need to be refilled. But I was fine. There are a lot of birthdays at this place so be prepared to listen to the staff sing and announce birthdays all night. I got the filet and it was sooo amazing! I'm glad my fun knowledgeable waitress recommended the shrimp to accompany it! The shrimp is sweet seduction ! Big sexy thick grilled shrimp basking in the most amazingly seasoned juice ! My steak was perfectly cooked but the steak fries were struggling and rather limp. I love the green beans here. Their rolls came out piping hot and don't get me started on that amazing cinnamon honey butter! Our waitress was awesome and there was a cute young guy who also helped us! My margarita was very good",

She told my friend to be a big boy and eat up they didn't have doggy bags. Then she walked away.  He was very disapointed and got up and walked out. I had to get another waiter to get the waitress for me. She said oh I though I was doing a good job. UM really how?  This experience has ruined it for me. I will not be back. I gave away my giftcards. Will not return.",

For as busy as it was he was very attentive. However, this review was about my food. I had the Roadhouse Steak Salad (or something like that) and it was decent. I didnt eat much or it and took it home. Oh how I wish I had finished it there so I could have shown the manager the piece of BROKEN CERAMIC in my salad. Alas...a few hours later I sat down to nibble on it and nearly broke my tooth on it! Now I dont want to finish the salad in fear of chipping my tooth or ripping my intestines open with sharp ceramic pieces! Needless to say it will be a long before I ever return to a Texas Roadhouse!",

She totally forgot about us and it was just 2 people at my table. While waiting on condiments our food had gotten cold since we waited 15 minutes. So, the Manager smoothed things over by making us brand new meals to go and giving us free entree vouchers for next time. My friend that was with me didn't request her dinner be re-made but the Manager showed up with a complete dinner anyway. She figured it was my friends first time dining at TR that she couldn't let her leave unhappy. I must say normally service is great and I will be returning. Just an off night for the waitress I suppose. Thanks to management for saving the day.",

    "text": "I guess the word is surprised, it was surprisingly good. It's just after 6 and we were invited out for steak dinner. The question was where to go with quite a number of choices here in the area. We talked about Bobby-Qs, Black Angus and Texas Roadhouse. None of us had tried here at the Texas Roadhouse  so we poked our heads in and there was a wait but not very long. They handed us a pager, we waited about 15 minutes and we were seated. You never really know when a place is working at capacity if things are going to go well, but as I have already hinted... no problemo!  The waitress introduced herself on the way to the table, while grabbing some rolls and honey butter. Sat us down in a booth got our drink order and offered us appetizers that she said would be out in a flash if we wanted one. We picked the onion blossom, it was a good choice crisp and tasty with a pair of dips for flavor, one was I believe a chipolte remoulade and the other their ranch dressing, both were good the chipolte was a little on the spicy side.  The atmosphere was noisy but we were able to talk as well as hear each other. The music is in keeping with the name, country western. While we were working on the onion blossom all of the sudden all the employees are lined up in the aisle clapping, I was expecting them to break out in a round of Happy Birthday but no... They line danced through the song... That was a new one on me. The staff in matching T-shirts that say \"I love my Job\" was dancing and singing to the music. Some were beginners, some much more proficient it was a hoot to watch. And like it started when the song was over everyone was back to work.  The order for our main course was taken, The 20 oz porterhouse for me, Jo had the steak salad, with William rounding out the order with a grilled chicken. Each plate came with 2 side dishes from a long list. I had a salad with blue cheese dressing, and the home fries. I will mention that William picked one that he didn't care for the green beans, when he mentioned it to the waitress, she offered to switch it without hesitation, The drinks were renewed before anyone could  get to the bottom of their glass and the steaks were amazing. This was 5 star.  Opps, I gave them 4 pretty much for the noise and the loud music, and we will go back I am sure. This is a fun place, and the prices are not out of line, a Texas down home kind of feel to the place will welcome you back, we are looking forward to it.",

My major complaint with restaurants any more is the high noise level. Texas Roadhouses are loud but one can converse without shouting and the dancing and \"Yee haws\" add to the fun of the meal.   I was cautious to go to this location since the Metro Center Mall seems to be mostly shuttered storefronts. But the restaurant felt safe and thriving.",

He quickly brought the quissecential peanut bucket. Took our drink orders and brought those wonderful sweet rolls reminiscent of Hawaiian rolls. 5 star.   Food order taken. One kids cheeseburger, one salmon, one bacon cheeseburger. Food came out quickly and hot. I can't vouch for the others but my salmon was cooked perfectly the only complaint is the lemony sauce that flooded the plate was extremely salty. Potato great. My son didn't really like his mini burgers because it was just meat and cheese. No lettuce, no tomato, he loves veggies in all capacity so this was a let down to him. My husband's burger cooked perfectly medium but he also said it was salty  The food was nothing special but the pricing is good for portions. My salmon was only $11.99 and all kid's meals are $4.99. The 4 star review is because the service was excellent. Dylan was great.  Will we return? Of course we feel it's a good value for your buck. Those rolls are worth the trip and wait.",

We called ahead for 9 people and still waited 45 minutes to be seated. It was a Friday night, so it was to be expected. Luckily there's an endless barrel of peanuts to chow down on to keep your belly somewhat satisfied for a bit. It's fun for the kids cuz you can actually throw the shells on the floor and no one will care. Plus, I don't have to clean it up!   As you are brought to your table they bring along their delicious yeast rolls and sweet butter. Mmmmm. I could feast on those amazing fluffy rolls of goodness and just be content. Our waiter was quick and on top of everything. She was always one step ahead on refills and super fun. She called my daughter out to dance with the waitresses and promised her ice cream after dinner, which she did follow through on.   Most of us orders steaks, to be expected. I got the mushroom sauce. Oh my, so good! I have always loved the steak fries as well. If you're not into steak the chicken critters and bbq chicken sandwich are always a good choice.   Ive never had a bad experience at Texas Roadhouse. Their food is always great quality. The restaurant is so upbeat and high energy. It's such an all around awesome restaurant.",

Second day got their \"fall of the bone ribs\" and they don't lie the meat actually falls off the bone. Third day got the all American burger and it was great.  And if you aren't full after your meal get their apple pie or the Big ol' brownie for dessert. 10/10 I wish they had one where I live. Waiters and waitresses also linedance for a minute or two.",

Enjoyed the baked sweet potato with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon on the side. The loaded baked potato was really good as well. Got a free appetizer (Cactus Blossom)by using the app. Very lively atmosphere. Our waiter \"Markus\" was amazing. Very welcoming and very friendly. Even it was busy but he made sure we got everything we need and always checking on us. He's a great example Of Best Customer Service. Thank You Markus!!!",

It's so fun that everyone dances every now and then!! All the servers stop what they are doing and line dance for a minute or so. Guest participation is encouraged and it looks like people have a ton of fun with it.  The owners are involved in the day to day and are awesome! They've been known to participate in fundraising opportunities for local nonprofit groups too.   As far as food - the filet medallions are one of my favorites. I noticed the option to add Green Chile to my steak was on the menu so I jumped at the chance. I'm a Green Chile snob and LOVE some from good ol HATCH, NM. Half of my family is from there! Well, I'm not sure exactly where they got theirs from but happy to report that it was FANTASTIC. It was so good. Roasted just right, just the right heat, just the right salt/garlic.... just right. The medallions were cooked perfectly too so the pair was magical and worth the visit!",

It's been years since I had been in. Matter of fact the times I ate there I always chose a poultry and vegetable entree as I did not eat beef. This time I decided to experience something new.  The moment we walked in around 5pm we were greeted and seated with some warm fresh bread. Our drink orders were immediately taken. My friend decided to try the Sangria Margarita with an upgraded double shot. I settled for water. Looking through the menu we did the two person dinner for $42.00. This included an appetizer which we ordered the onion blossom. It still has not changed. Very tasty. I ended up getting a rib eye now that I beef sometimes. Along with a sweet potato and buttery corn. My friend ordered the Shrimp and Sirloin with green beans and a loaded potato. I was highly impressed with the taste of all items. The fact that they cut there meat there fresh and serve us our food in a timely matter we were very pleased.  Observing the service at other tables I have to say everyone was please. Great service from all staff who even had a chance to line dance. The manager made my friends day by giving her a bag of peanuts to go along with a free appetizer for her next visit since it was her first time there. We will be back again.",

Their rattlesnake bites made of  jalapeno and cheese were also delicious.  I love how when certain songs come on all the waiters and waitresses start to dance. For their food, one night I ordered the steak kebabs with loaded mashed potatoes. Probably one of the best loaded mashed potatoes I've had. Tasted like how I would make it at home and not premixed. It was layered on a bowl with mashed potatoes, butter, cheese, sour cream, and bacon. The steak and bell peppers and onion on the Kebob were marinated. The meat was very tender and flavored well. The next time we came here I ordered their smothered chicken which come with a side and two marinated chicken breasts topped with jack cheese mushrooms and onions. Again, the meat was seasoned well and tender! Both dishes were really good. Not to mention the pieces are amazingly cheap compared to CA. We loved it here.",

He was so lively, and was always there with refills without being asked. He engaged in conversation and it was great having him as a server, I will definitely be asking for him again!

I live on the opposite side of town and would never come to this Texas Roadhouse for lunch/dinner.   I will say....I was very impressed.  This restaurant not only accommodate the entire party, but the staff was awesome.  Although, we couldn't all sit at one table they gave a section and we took over several tables.  The staff was accommodating, patient, courtesy and friendly.    Food-great selection on the menu.  I think in our party alone we ordered one of everything from the menu.  I am not a chained restaurant person, so I ordered a classic burger  to be on the safe side, it was awesome!  Someone else in our party ordered their sweet potatoes and they were delicious.  My son is a mac n cheese guy...and it came out cold he had to send it back, but it wasn't an issue.  They were very accommodating.    All in all, I was very impress with the staff and how they handle our 30+ party situation.  Kudos, to the staff for being so friendly, accommodating and very patient.  I will seek out a Texas Roadhouse -East Valley.  In the future, if some asks let's try Texas Roadhouse, I won't say no.",

If you don't mind the loud music it's a great place to go but if you're trying to have a quiet meal forget it. I won't go back",

From the shelled peanuts in a bucket at the table; to the line dancing in the aisles; to the delicious food; it's all a lot of fun and a great experience.  The service is exceptional, the employees really seem to like working there.  They are energetic, friendly and helpful.  The food is great, Love the dinner rolls!!!  I wasn't expecting the salmon to be anything special, but I must admit it is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had, cooked perfectly and seasoned properly, it really doesn't get much better.  I also like that it's a place I can take everyone in my family.  My mom's a vegetarian, my dad hard to please and other family members have some diet restrictions, but the menu is flexible enough to accommodate everyone.  The servers know their stuff too, so special requests are not a problem and they know what is in their food so dietary restrictions questions are confidently answered.  It's a good time, with good food, and a fun atmosphere.",

It was a bit of a wait because they were busy. There is a ton of peanuts around if anybody is allergic to peanuts they would NOT want to come here.... I had a few of them...they were good lol. But honestly I doubt you're reading this to find out about the peanuts. I got the bbq chicken sandwich which came with fries. They also brought out a basket of fresh baked bread with cinnamon butter. I made the mistake of trying them because they are amazing. However because I ate so much of the bread, I only had room for a few bites of the sandwich and took most of it to go... it had nice flavoring though. But the bread... YUM!",

We walk in and the five of us were seated quickly.  SERVICE:  Was very good!   Each staff member greeted us with a smile.   Our server was friendly, polite and right on top of taking and bringing us our drink orders.   Plus once our vittles arrived, he was never far away if we needin' anything.  FOOD:  OK, now ya'll tell me what's wrong with this here picture:  We're in this restaurant called \"Texas Roadhouse\" and they do, yes ya'll guessed it, steaks and BBQ!   But do any of us order a Texas sized steak or a slab O' ribs or a pile of pulled pork or a big ol' burger or any other stick to yer ribs item on the menu?   Heck No buckeroo!    Two of us order the Chicken Critter Salad and the other three order the Chicken Critters.   Someone call the sheriff 'cuz this should be again' the law!  Now that I got that outta ma system...  The Chicken Critter Salad (greens, jack & cheddar cheeses, egg, tomato, and bacon) was filling and pretty tasty.   Chicken Critters are Chicken strips with a different batter on um.   When they be fried up the batter runs and they look like them hole jumbo prawn thingamajigs!   Kinda kewl!  We 'all finished our mid-day vittles and moseyed on back to the ranch.  4 stars.",

I had the steak and ribs combo with a sweet potato and caeser salad. Service was friendly but a little slow.  The salad was ok, but drenched in dressing. The baked sweet potato was excellent.   The steak was ordered medium rare. It arrived that way, but the meat wasn't flavorful. It wasn't overcooked, but it still tasted bland. The ribs were better. Not amazing but pretty good.   Overall, it wasn't a bad meal, but I'm not in a rush to return. The atmosphere is loud with birthday party songs etc.",

The restaurant was super accommodating and they basically gave us an entire section to ourselves and we had multiple servers at our disposal.  Being from CA the prices were lower than I was used to which was a nice surprise. However, the better surprise was the extraordinary service provided by the staff.  They were always available, attentive, helpful and very friendly. They gave us all our options for splitting checks and how to best get our players served their food.  I was impressed with the responsiveness to say the least. Additionally, considering we were such a large group (at least 30 people) we were in and out of there in about 90 minutes!  And they had really good food! The only downside (for me) was I could tell that everything was cooked in butter, some people really like that but not me. Other than though it was great experience!",

The greeter asked us if we have ever been to that location and let her know we had not and she said well we are definitely the best one. She sure was right. The waitress was great at keeping us stocked with fresh bread with that cinnamon butter YUUUUMMM and our drinks full. # of us order the prime rib and one the cowboys cut steak. It was all SOOO good. Even the onion blossom we had as an appetizer was delicious. It was a little greasy at the bottom but that's to be expected when it's deep fried. Overall was very very pleased with our experience. The dance the staff does is also pretty cool and created a fun environment. Overall the food was great and the all the staff seemed energetic and eager to help and make you comfortable. As we walked out, I don't think there was one person we walked by that did not thank us for coming in. Definitely will be back to this location!",

She was beyond awesome with a wonderful customer service personality, really made our night (Thank you Shelly Mac!). At least 4 different employees made direct eye contact and smiled at us with \"Have a great night\" when we left and even packed us up some peanuts for the kiddos to go... Very usual to be greeted at the door but not so usual to be treated well at the exit! Thank you Texas Roadhouse and Shelly Mac for a great family outing!",

Waitress Trisha (?) arrived promptly and explained menu to us (pretty self explanatory...these are the appetizers, the salads, etc), took our drink order and returned with our drinks.  Our dinner guests arrived - we waited 15+- minutes, flagged down another waitress to please take drink order of our guests.  Trisha arrived with refills for us - told guest their drink order was on it's way.  The margarita took at least 30 additional minutes to arrive!   Ordered, explained in detail, no pickle, lettuce, tomato or onions on cheese burger...plain - meat & bun; explained salmon order, sauce on the side.   Dinner order arrived, burger was not plain, pickle on plate and the runner forgot one of our sides.   Waited awhile, no one came to check on us - flagged down a runner and asked for other side.  Trisha returned to table to check on us, I explained that I was not happy, burger ordered, not delivered, missing side.  She said she was sorry but hadn't heard me order a plain burger!   Really, we had a huge discussion about it.  Skip the dancing and work on your people skills.   Very surprised a manager didn't arrive at our table to ask what the problem was.   Won't be back!",

    "text": "I live nearby this new location, I have never been to a Texas Roadhouse before so I figured we'd try it some time. When we went for dinner it was a Friday night, around 6 pm. This place was packed!!!! There was a 45 minute wait, but we didn't care because we have never eaten there before. After our buzzer went off we went inside. We were immediately seated. Our server took a little while to appear and take our drink orders, which I could understand since they were extremely busy. As some one else noted this place is LOUD! You can't hear conversations amongst your table. While waiting for my food I started to feel light headed and dizzy because of how loud and cramped this place is. After we placed our order it didn't take long for our food to arrive. The steak I ordered look and tasted delicious, as did everyone's food. But when I started to eat my baked potato, and had already taken a couple of bites I noticed there was something in it... After i pulled what it was out between my fingers I realized it was a friggin eyelash. EYELASH! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! At this point I was already a little upset and disappointed about this restaurant. But now I was completely grossed out. Our server was at the table next to ours. She had been there chatting it up, clearly with people she knew. We called for her attention, 5 time! Finally she decided when it was convenient for her she broke away from her conversation, and approached our table. When we pointed out the eyelash to her she acted like it was nothing, and that people receiving eyelashes with their baked potatoes were a common thing. She asked if I wanted a different potato. DUH I WANT A NEW POTATO!!!!! No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it. My mother-in-law spoke for me since I was so grossed out that I didn't even respond. After that I finished the steak, but the new potato went to waste. As we were leaving, there was a burly looking biker guy who was extremely intoxicated, and rude to my mother-in-law, by saying obscene comments. The people who go to this place are seedy, and so is the service. The only positive thing I can say about that place is that it's cheap. But at that price who knows what you might find in your food. Never again will I eat here. I knew we should have gone to Black Angus...",

My pulled pork was a huge serving and was moist but not too greasy.  The rolls were good but did not seem fabulous as others claim (warm and fresh, but a bit too greasy on the outside).

Prepared to your preference. What makes this particular spot stand above the rest is the combination of the food service price(early Bird dinner before 6 deals) & good energy from every single one.

The setting at the table was dirty and I asked for a replacement; they brought me a different serving set with dried food on it...dam. Assuming you don't have this experience I suggest you try their half dinner portion because it's quite filling.  The pork chop was juicy, my side of corn was good, and the chili I ordered wasn't bad either.  I got to taste some of the other dishes too and liked the flavor of their six ounce steak and house salad.  All in all a great value at $38 for three dinners with drinks.  Side note, stay away from the peanuts on the table, they're not fresh and you'll want to leave room for the food.",

We often order our food to go through the app but I had mistakenly sent my order to another location. Upon arriving and trying to pay, the manager at this location and I realized my mistake. I had my four month old in my arms and had no idea what could be done. Without hesitation the manager put in my order, called the other location to let them know I wouldn't be picking up there and got my payment voided for me. She made me feel like it was truly not a big deal even though I could tell she was going out of her way to correct my mistake.  The staff here has always been friendly and given great customer service but this particular experience really stood out and it's no wonder the staff is so awesome under such great leadership. I only wish I would have gotten her name.",

She was rude, was impatient when dealing with us, she had to be asked 3 times for lemon, when my husbands meal came out incorrectly she avoided the situation leaving the young lady that brought it out to deal with it.  The manager came to our table to talk to my husband about his meal and before she left she asked if we needed anything I asked for butter, she told Lauren to get it that never happened.  After being beyond frustrated, we asked for the bill.  It was wrong.  She charges us for a soda when it came with my son's kids meal.  I asked her to take it off.  She yanked the bill out of my hand and walked away.  24 minutes - 24 minutes later she finally came back.   As she walked by our table she tossed the bill folder on the table and didn't even say thank you!  Texas Roadhouse is one of my favorite restaurants, but after last night I don't know that I'll go back.  My experience was absolutely awful!",

We got rattle snake bites, flavorless, tasted like they came from a frozen bag which im sure they did. My husband got a 16 ounce steak, garden salad and potatoes. The salad was so weird tasting, like no flavor and tasted watery. My husband said the steak was one of the worst steaks he has ever had, he left more than half of it on the plate when we left and didn't touch his mashed potatoes.  My daughters mac n cheese was kraft which is no problem but it was so dry she wanted nothing to do with it.   I had the California salad and I have no complaints about it, it was actually decent.  I used to go to roadhouse all the time and even worked at one for a short period of time and I do believe the quality of food has just gone downhill.",

    "text": "Arrogant and incompetent, period. Have been here a few times for after work happy hour, drinks and apps were typical. However, we started ordering to go orders that at first were fine, then they must of had a management change or they just don't care. The first few problems were incorrect orders. I know it is not a huge thing, however if you ordered your salad with ranch and they give you a dressing you don't like, your out your salad. The the problem was our order was 30 mins late after we phoned in ahead.  I called the manager after 20 mins and she was so nonchalant about the situation and could basically care less and blamed it on new training. So today, I called and was on hold for 9 mins, called back and on hold for 6 mins, called back and asked for a manager and lucky me I got to speak with the \"nonchalant\" manager. She was nice and borderline bubbly and explained away my hold time for more training issues. I told her briefly of our past experiences and she could again care less and asked what we wanted to order. We ordered 2 steaks, one med well and one med rare. One with white gravy for the potatoes and one with brown. We pick up the order and it was ready, cool beans now I don't have to listen to my roommate complain about the wait. HOLD ON, put on the breaks. They gave us two med rare steaks when I wanted one med well and both had brown gravy.   How does this happen? How can a manager take an order from a customer who has had problems in the past and not check it? Well, I tried calling but was on hold for 7 mins and for my sanity decided tio just call corporate tomorrow. Oh they did give us 2 extra rolls though. I took a pic of the raw meat that is still in my fridge.   There are literally 2-3 other steak places next door, do yourself a favor and skip Texas Road House, clearly from their phone takers to management they are all incompetent.",

Exceptionally pleased with this location time after time. I've just stopped ordering ribs from here as well as any number of other steak places in town. I guess my tastes run different.  Arrived after 9 p.m. on a weeknight. Greeted and seated right away. Server was nearby and apologized for taking so long to get to us. Huh? She was there in a couple minutes.  It's hot so I let her know I'd be drinking a lot of water. Smart server: she brought extra glasses. Made us both happy.  Huge qty of pulled pork served hot! Great side of chili. I like it so much I asked for 2 of them as my 2 sides. Didn't even flinch. Just served what I'd ordered.  We drive past the location off of Happy Valley as well as the one on the west side around Bell off 101 to come to this one even though it adds 15-30 minutes more driving.  $6 house marg is a good deal. I don't drink often so I can actually taste the tequila without paying extra for a kicker.",

I ordered a pork chop for dinner and it comes with a pepper sauce (thankfully on the side).  I chose sides of mashed potatoes and buttered corn.  The corn had so much pepper in it you could almost not see the yellow.  It barely tasted like corn at all and I couldn't eat much of it.  Our server was exceptionally friendly although really slow to bring things like butter or water refills out.  She did bring fresh rolls because she took so long to bring the requested regular butter.  Apparently they were having a server meeting in the kitchen and you can't leave the meeting even if you have a guest requesting something.  I don't think that is a good practice at all - your guest requests should come before a staff meeting.  All the servers had to do a line dance of sorts during dinner also and it was pretty clear none of them were jazzed about having to do it.  Seemed kinda hokey - something more appropriate for a bar in Mexico than a restaurant in Phoenix.  But back to the food, my pork chop was absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes were very good also.  Only thing I would advise is lay off the pepper. And if your buttered corn is actually peppered corn, it should be advertised as such.",

    "text": "This was freaking fantastic!   My friend and I were in town visiting with family and just happened to be in the Metro Center area. We decided we felt like hitting a steakhouse and on the perimeter of the mall there were three in a row near I-17. Since this place was recommended by a co-worker of one of my family members, it won out. We checked Yelp! and noticed it had 3 1/2 stars, so my expectations were somewhat tempered, but we went ahead anyway.  What a pleasant surprise! We were immediately acknowledged by the host with a big smile and, even though the place was pretty busy, were immediately led to a booth.   Now it is loud in there, but we very much enjoyed the atmosphere! It was lively and festive..very upbeat! Our waitress came out and asked if it was our first visit and answered a ton of questions regarding menu items and hooked up our drinks right away. She was very personable and engaging. We were already impressed with the service level at this point and now were anxious to check out the food!  I ordered the 11 oz. sirloin steak with a caesar salad and mashed potatoes(14.99). The steak was so thick and juicy, cooked perfectly to the medium rare I love!   My friend ordered a large porterhouse T-Bone steak (24.99) which was huge! I was jealous! I'll have to grab that next time!  My other friend grabbed the \"Road Kill\" (14.99) (sounds appetizing, doesn't it? lol), which is a 10 oz. chop steak smothered with sauteed onions, sauteed mushrooms, and jack cheese. He was able to add a side of ribs and a bowl of chili to that as well.   It was fantastic how they staggered the dishes! First we had the salads and the chili. Shortly after finishing those dishes, out came the main dishes! It was just perfectly timed! Everybody at the table was raving about how great the food tasted!  All the while, the staff would announce when a member of the military was in the restaurant or when someone had a birthday! They would than lead the whole place into a Yee-Haw!! to celebrate! lol We got a kick out of it! It was fun! Than near the end of our meal the staff came out and did a whole sing-dance-line dance routine. We were really enjoying the atmosphere! I've read other reviewers complain about these things, and I say....shut the hell up! Its called TEXAS ROADHOUSE! What did you expect?? Miserable pricks...  On top of all that, as we were getting ready to leave, the manager approached us and acknowledged it was our first visit, thanked us, and presented us with a complimentary bag of peanuts. I know it was just a bag of peanuts, but I was really impressed! It was a class move and it just sealed the 5 star deal for me!  So to re-cap: Great service, great food, fun and festive atmosphere...all at an insanely affordable price! How can you lose??? Get down here and check this place out! You won't regret it!  5 stars.",

They figured out the error and went about fixing it. There was a mix up in the beverages and my diabetic father got a glass of sweet tea when he ordered Ice tea. It was more or less one disaster after another. Through it all the waitress, the manager and even the rest of the staff went above and beyond.

Unusual in these tough economic times- a good sign! We were told -an ACCURATE- 30-40 min wait. Ok, no prob, so we found a seat & enjoyed the free peanuts. Once seated we had a GREAT server named Matt. I have a dairy intolerance & he was happy to go to the kitchen to find out about the rolls he had just placed before us. While they are brushed with butter & I was willing to eat all but the tops, he actually brought me my own basked of rolls that hadn't been brushed! That was real nice! We ordered our entrees and I was really disappointed that they were out of the 1/2 chicken, so I ordered something else....but then 5 min later Matt reappeared to tell me the 1/2 chickens just came out of the oven & he had snagged one for me! Wow! Perfect!  All the food - from the rolls to the entrees to the side dishes- were piping hot and delicious. My hubby, who is a hearty eater said his portion size was perfect. I had leftovers for the next day. Service was quick and attentive (glasses quickly refilled) and what a value! With a generous tip (over 20%) we still walked out under $30. Hubby & I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant with NOTHING bad to say! That says a lot! Great meal, great staff, great value! We'll be back, for sure! :)",

So far my favorite is the BBQ chicken that only the fabulous waitress Melissa knows how to order for me. Every time I try to order via another server, it always comes out WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! Their croutons (yes croutons) are delicious as they are made fresh daily every single day. I am a little obsessed with to the point that I only want my side dish to be one HUGE salad with a ton of croutons. Oh and don't forget about there fresh baked rolls. There have a been a few times in which they tasted stale. Not sure how that is even possible but it has happened. I will say that as long as I am dating this guy, this place will be on a constant rotation. SMH! until next time....",

From jump, my waiter was being a smarty pants. When our food finally came out, the fries were ice cold and there were literally 7 fries in the basket.. So I kindly told him to get us some fresh ones and hopefully a few more. Not even one minute later, he brings back, I kid you not, the same basket.. I'm like umm sir these are the same. He looks flustered and says he's going to tell his manager so she can get it taken care of. Seriously, your guys' specialty isn't fries. Fries are pretty simple. So some time later, the manager comes out with it. By the time we received the fresh fries, we were all done eating. When he brought me the check, I asked him what my niece gets for a birthday type deal and he says ice cream and walks away. I was like wow, he just doesn't like us anymore.

The food was also amazing I got the 16 oz rib eye and the steak was so good it seemed to melt in my mouth with every bite and at the end Felicia grabbed a saddle and had my 54 year old father sit on it and did the Texas roadhouse yeeeee haaaaaawwww song and dance. just an amazing experience and I will be back in the future. being there is a black angus and another steakhouse right next door to each other there is no comparison even the price was good. best steakhouse hands down.

    "text": "We went there for my birthday.  We were greeted OK, as it was busy we waited about 10 minutes,  no problem there.  I ordered a 12 oz ribey rare.  Meals took about another 15 minutes.  My ribeye was cooked correctly, however it was very tough, full of gristle.  Flavor was good,  I wonder the grade of steaks they serve.",
