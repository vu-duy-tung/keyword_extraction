I won't lie, I was a little concerned about the location. (pretty shady area) but seeing all the good reviews and the five star ratings. I had to go see for myself. Let me tell you, the service was great the staff makes you feel welcomed and make sure that you are properly taken care of including the owner who is also the chef. The food was delicious  everything was great from the appetizer all they way to the dessert. Oh and lets not forget the drinks... the bartender he knows what's up!",

All very tasty and would get again. The guacamole was very fresh and the addition of pineapple was delicious! For dessert, we had the churros and they were out of this world! Hands down the best part of the meal! We met Mr. Madrigal, very nice man and he went out to every table to ask how their meal was and personally thank them for coming in.  Great addition to Phoenix, always looking for new restaurants and they did not disappoint! We will be back, that's for sure!",

Reminded me of risotto but still distinctly Mexican, and cooked to perfection. The staff was helpful and friendly, our waiter Eduardo was kind enough to go through all of the specials and gave us the background on the restaurant and the chef, and we just had a fantastic experience. You can't go wrong with a late lunch or early dinner from this fantastic little restaurant. Go early and beat the crowds for Happy Hour ($2 off appetizers and drink specials can't be beat). We were just driving through but if we could, we would eat here all the time. As an added bonus, the chef came out and personally visited with each of the guests dining in the restaurant. It was great to be able to talk to him and compliment his cooking in person. 5 Stars!",

It's a little hole in the wall. We noticed as we drove by, several people sitting in the patio and thought we would give it a try.  Parking could be better, but we found a spot easy enough.  When we walked in we were welcomed and seated. Eduardo (I hope I got the name correct), greeted us right away. We ordered a Margarita and the guacamole and chips.  Both were delicious! The guac tasted homemade and the chips,  which was a big portion, were fresh.  We were undecided between a few things, Eduardo recommended that we could order the barbacoa enchilada and wild mushroom enchilada, one of each with rice and beans. Amazing! The barbacoa was delicious but the wild mushroom enchilada was absolutely the best enchilada I think i've ever had! If you like mushrooms,  order this!   We were so full there was no way we could eat dessert,  but seeing it go by our table, we new we were missing out.  Definitely,  next time though!",

I saw excellent reviews and decided to bring my whole family in for dinner tonight. We were greeted by the sweet and helpful hostess Yazmin (not sure on the spelling). She seated the 6 of us. We told her we came in because of the Yelp reviews and we excited to see a mom & pop place in south Phx. She was the daughter of the Chef. Her lovely mother brought us homemade guacamole and chips to start off our meal. The guac was so thick and flavorful. We ordered a round of margaritas on the rocks and also order the Trio!! Then on to our entrees . The food came out looking amazing and each bite was full of flavor.  The Beans & Rice were delicious ..You can mix and match the Tacos too. One of the owners offered for us to try the frozen margaritas. They offered a powerful kick and made without ice. Absolutely amazing and gave you a nice buzz. After we finished our main course we had to try all the desserts. I honestly enjoyed each one and can't even give you a favorite . Each one was delicious in its own way. We finished everything !!! The Chef stopped by to say hello and it really felt like he cared about his customers.. This will be a staple for us to visit. Welcome to the south mountain family Cocina Madrigal.. love this new place!!",

I look forward to coming back here so I can try a few of the other items on the menu (especially the elote).

    "text": "As a resident of SoPho for the past 8 years I was heart broken when Amano Pizza Bistro left the neighborhood. We have so few non chain restaurants here and their departure left a huge void. That's why I was so happy to spot Cocina Madrigal as I headed north on 16th street one fine morning. My husband and I had the chance to dine there last night and we will most certainly be back. Don't let the less than glamorous street corner (16th and Wood just north of Broadway) discourage you. Inside this restaurant the chef creates some of the best Mexican food you'll ever have.  We started with the appetizer sampler - delicious made to order guac and queso fundido with mushrooms and caramelized onions - insanely good. Although not a vegetarian I ordered the mushroom enchiladas - oh my ....... incredible, rich, earthy and satisfying - even their beans are incredible. My husband got the mammoth steak burrito - the meat was tender and had a nice tang to it. Topped off the experience with their hot, crunchy churros - not to be missed.  Oh, and did I mention the margaritas? Potent and yummy. A hidden gem in an area that is crying out for quality non chain restaurants.",

Definitely come to this place if you want mouthwatering food, delicious drinks, and exceptionally friendly service. I will definitely be back the next time I visit Phoenix.",

How cool to have the chef and owner of a business come greet you.  You rarely find that these days.

Even though they have only been in business a short time, they shine!  They are winners just through the personal attention given to each guest.  But the food is such a standout among others, and meeting Chef Leo, the owner, was such a special treat!  I had the grilled romaine salad with olive oil and marinated beef tenderloin and my husband had the Barbacoa and wild mushroom enchiladas.  We also had the bacon jalapeno guacamole that was freshly made for us and their already famous margaritas that are perfection!  Here's a picture of my salad!  All I can say is I wish this restaurant was in Houston!",

Very impressed by ALL the food. The only negative thing I would say is that the house margaritas were overpriced at $9 each and had virtually no alcohol in them. We each had 2 and no buzz at all. Usually one margarita is plenty for me, so I was a bit underwhelmed. Even with the margs, I still give this place 5 stars because the food is THAT good.",

The combination of ingredients sounded interesting and in theory it would have been but there was a very bitter aftertaste of rubber... I don't know if it was bc of the gloves they used to prep the food or something else... The tacos came with rice and beans and it was the smallest proportion I had ever seen (they were in \"sauce\" containers... not enough for a \"side\") not good value for the price.  the waiter was nice enough initially but only checked on us once.... then disappeared which is saying something since it is such a small place. We never got a refill on our drinks and had to go looking for him to get our check. I only had the tacos and went home. I felt queasy all night. The food did not sit well with me.",

I was a bit intimidated having driven past this place many times but never stopped. I'm so glad we decided to try it! I was greeted by the hostess and she was very friendly and went to check on my order. While I was waiting, the owner came over and offered me water, tea, soda on the house. He gave me 2 free iced tea in a to go cup for free, which by the way, was really delicious (think tropical fruit)! The owner stood there and chatted with me the whole time I waited for my order! Such service to me is unheard of nowadays, especially as a \"to-go\" customer. One of the servers also stopped what he was doing to come and open the door for me on my way out! Now, the food. The chips and salsa were awesome, tasted like they were made in house and salsa very flavorful! I got the beef birria enchiladas. The meat was so tender and delicious and the sauces were great. My hubby got 3 types of tacos which were all delish but the fish taco was probably our favorite! We also got the elote, which was outstanding!! We couldnt put it down and were arguing over it! Next time we will order 2 of them! We also got the churros which were filled with deliciousness and a yummy cream sauce on the side. We have been dreaming about the food since we went and will definitely be making this one of our regular places! I applaud the outstanding service and unforgettable food!",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time tonight -- I am IMPRESSED!  The chef is a veteran of places like Taco Guild and Z'Tejas (back when it was good!) and now has his own place. My dinner companion had the mushroom enchiladas and they were amazing. I'll order them next time if there is some reason I don't order the entree I enjoyed beyond measure tonight...the Chicken Artichoke Mushroom Stack.  Wow!    We had the guacamole and chips, which is made fresh to order. It's outstanding! It also came with a delicious house salsa that had heat, flavor and excellent balance.   The mixed veggies that came with my entree purportedly came with broccoli (I detest it) and our server promised me a broccoli-free side serving. The veggies were fantastic but very salty. The only reason I didn't give this locally-owned gem all five stars was the fact that I found the meal to be heavily salted. The chef has a great pedigree and superb sense of food pairing, accompaniments and the chemistry it takes to make an exceptional meal. The flavors are outstanding...go lighter on the salt and let the other ingredients shine through.   Overall, very happy to discover this gem! Please check it out! I'll be back!",

The food was so good, plus I was driving so I couldn't sample the Tequilas, which looked enticing. I had the enchaladas, one beef and one pork, and the guacamole with serrano peppers. The flavors were amazing. I was so full but I didnt want to give it up. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll have to come back.",

The beef tenderloin tacos with Gorgonzola crumbles and fried peppers I will taste for the rest of my life, when I reflect on this moment.  The mushroom enchiladas were so flavorful and filling!

Type of tia made it at home. The environment is chill and so down to earth. When I come back to AZ. Definitely stopping by again ! Thank you guys!",

Get the guacamole with bacon and jalapenos which is super fresh, the corn melts in your mouth, and the tacos are super delish! And the drinks are so smooth that you just want to spend all afternoon here. But most importantly is the atmosphere and the customer service is top notch! The owner and the waiter were super friendly and talkative with us and to top it off the chef personally came & spoke with us. He was so kind, informative and just a pleasure to talk to! Best customer service ever!   Check this place out it's the best taste of Mexico right in your own backyard!!!",

I guess I wanted authentic Mexican food not hooped up gringo food. Place is a nice neighborhood restaurant. Menu is limited and pricey. My Mexican friends would not like this place. Too Americanized. Stick to basics and authenticity. Simplicity works.",

The owner and entire staff were incredibly friendly. It was highly recommended by the staff to try the Guac De Casa. One of the best and most authentic I had in a long time. It was so fresh, the huge chunk of guac, and truly homemade. I can lick the bowl.   I had a sip of my friend's Michelada. It was absolutely refreshing, savory, citrusy, and a little kick to it. My friends tried the Five Cheese Macaroni & Chicken, Hatch Green Chile Pork with tortillas, and grilled Elote with cotija cheese. I tried the Chicken, Artichoke & Mushroom Stack. I loved when a char-grilled chicken is slightly burnt. The creamy sauce and flavor will stimulate your taste buds.   Cocina Madrigal will take you away as if you're enjoying a meal South of the Border, not South Phoenix. I can't wait to return for Happy Hour.",

We made reservations through yelp and used the additional comments to advise how many in our party since max people were less than our group. When we arrived I was surprised they actually read the notes. This typically doesn't happen so off to a great start. We were seated right away, ordered drinks and appetizers. Margaritas were very good but on the small size and a little overpriced. Guacamole and salsa were very good. The staff was extremely polite and attentive even on this day. The restaurant was so warm that it became an issue during our meal. Diana our waitress was awesome!  We enjoyed the Charred Romaine salad and shared with our table which was amazing! La Diabla Chicken was my dish and other than the noodles needing to be more al dente it was absolutely delicious. The flavor just fantastic, definitely would order again. Filet was on the list which I was told was very good. Our table had veggie, shrimp, steak, fish tacos as well as my niece had a turkey burger. Needless to say there were no complaints other than the temperature of the restaurant. Hands down this is a place that I will be going back. Thanks for an enjoyable Father's Day lunch!",

I'll specifically call out the al pastor taco with pineapple and bacon as excellent. We finished with a double order of churros, which were warm and delicious.

The enchiladas had wild mushrooms (their biggest seller). And the mushrooms, with their creamy sauce, really pop, inside this enchilada.  The queso fundido had a flavorful, but not overpowering chorizo.  But I came to the restaurant for the churros...omfg. Hands down best I have ever had. Better than Spain, Mexico, Cali.... And the drink pairing... Negro Modelo.  Everyone was really nice, and the service...perfect.  Compliments to chef Madrigal",

    "text": "Looking for a local Mexican dinner near our hotel by the airport, we pulled up to this stand-alone restaurant in a nearby quiet neighborhood. As we entered the door, we didn't expect much out of this local joint as the dining room was fairly plain and small while half the section was dedicated to the bar area. We were seated by the noisy bar at a small table. After we got our margaritas, we saw some tables in the quieter dining section open up so we asked the hostess to move us. Both the hostess and the waitress were very friendly and accommodating as we resituated ourselves by the window. This was when our delightful experience began. Starting with the best Tortilla Soup we ever had, the home-made flavors consisting of avacado chunks and shredded pork were incredible. The soup's  consistency was just right - not too thick and not too watery while maintaining all the right blend of spices. We quickly cleaned our bowl before we moved on to another delectable shared entree of Al Pastor Tacos. There were three different flavored meats in the home-made soft shell tacos and they were all very tasty. After the pleasure of last taco bite, we decided to end our meal with the order of Churros that we saw on the menu. It turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable dessert.  We had many Churros in various places before but none was as delicious as these home-made Churros. We had a hard time controlling ourselves as our taste buds were bouncing around inside our mouth with delights. The Churros were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The dish came with the almond colored dipping sauce that further heightened the flavors. Even though this was our last night in Phoenix, we were wishing that we could come back one more time just to eat these Churros again. As the nice waitress gave us our check, she mentioned that we had to try their amazing home-made Coconut Cake. That was when we had to pinch ourselves to abstain from further indulgence and painfully dragged our feet out the door before we became the slaves of this wonderful culinary find.",

Also, I'm generally not a fan of frozen margaritas but holy shnike these are good and STRONG.  The staff and owner are so kind, attentive, and genuine. The owner came out just to thank us for spending a rainy New Years' Eve day at his restaurant.

The guacamole starter in particular is very good and obviously fresh and the Oaxaca fundido (cheese cooked in skillet with mushrooms and jalapenos served with tortillas) was abfab as well. We had ordered different types of enchiladas as well as tacos and the make-your-own burrito. The mushroom enchiladas was a def standout and, I would have to say, one of the best mex dishes I have tried. The green chile Barbacoa enchilada was great too. Ordered a strawberry margarita and it was decently strong. I had put 3 Mexican restaurants in my Yelp list and of the other two, one was closed for the day and the other permanently closed.

The chef came to our table just before dessert and gave us a genuine heartfelt thank you.  Was so impressed.    The location is relatively unassuming from the outside and considering the neighborhood a much more upscale ambience inside than I was anticipating.  The food was absolutely amazing.  Started with the trio which is chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso fundido.  The queso, to my surprise, contained caramelized onions, perfectly sauteed mushrooms, longaniza sausage, roasted jalapenos, and epazote herb.  A True flavor explosion!  I followed that up with one wild mushroom and one barbacoa enchilada.  They make their own corn tortillas and they are just as good or slightly superior to Cocina Presidio Mexicana.  I cannot wait to go back and try the tacos.  My friends both ordered the 3 taco combination with al pastor, barbacoa, and steak.  They were both extremely impressed and we all were in agreement that this will become a regular Mexican standby.",

We over-ordered, but could not decide.  Guacamole with bacon and jalapeno...Brilliant.  Beef Birria and Barbacoa enchiladas were the best enchiladas we have ever had.  The wild mushroom enchiladas are rich without being too heavy. If you like mushrooms, you will love them! The ingredients are clearly fresh, and the flavor profiles complex without being overwhelming. Even the chips &salsa were top notch.  No jug'o salsa and stale chips from a warming drawer here! The frozen margaritas were heads and shoulders above any we have tasted. We will be regulars and are thrilled to see Leo's talent come to the community through Cocina Madrigal!",

Once again the flavor was amazingly good a little too spicy for my taste but very tasty  however was accompanied with corn tortillas and once again not homemade, we ordered the mushroom enchiladas,  a combination of flavors that made them very tasty and the trio tacos fish, chicken and pastor, I couldn't eat the chicken because the achiote flavor was not a good marriage with the chicken, the pastor was very good as well as the fish once again too spicy for my taste but flavors were amazingly good.  My only recommendation is to make sure the staff can explain and understand the food, Is embarrassing to ask for descriptions and be told I don't know or I don't like it!",

Birria enchilada were to die for sat in the car and thought about ordering more for the ride back to Cave Creek. Churros are often an afterthought but here they were killer both in taste and presentation! Ice cold draft beers and I can see myself easily driving 70 plus miles round trip for a north of the border experience with south of the border flair! Thank you and we will see you again soon.",

The Trio appetizer is a great starter with Fundido, Guacamole and salsa with chips.  The beef birria and the barbacoa green chili enchilada were so good I wanted to lick the plate.  The chef/owner came to check on our meal and spent several minutes chatting.  If you are even remotely close to Phoenix stop in for a great meal.  You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Stop what you're doing and go eat at Cocina Madigral! We went for dinner tonight after rave reviews from neighbors and it was a fantastic dinner. We started with chips and salsa and Chef Madigral brought housemade guac to our table. All of it was fresh and delicious. I ordered 2 al pastor and 1 steak taco. Both had creative ingredients and meat that was perfectly cooked. My husband and in-laws each got burritos. My husband saw barbacoa enchilada and asked if his burrito could have barbacoa (which wasn't a listed option) and they made it happen. My in-laws split a steak burrito and even with two people they couldn't finish. Just since we were trying out a new place we also ordered a dessert to share between all of us. We got an amazing churro dessert with a sweet cream and caramel dipping sauce and it was heaven!  Don't go here expecting a typical run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. But, do go here if you want delicious, inventive food with awesome portions at a great price. So happy to have this in the neighborhood! The staff was also amazing which isn't easy to find these days- they were knowledgeable, friendly, and enthusiastic. Hats off to the team at Cocina Madrigal!",

    "text": "Wow. What an amazing new restaurant! The service was fantastic and very attentive. The interior is so beautiful and clean. Very warm and welcoming. Now the food. The star of the show. Being a new restaurant we had to try a few things. We started with chips, salsa, and housemade guacamole. The salsa was spiced perfectly, just hot enough to feel it and making crave more. The guacamole tastes so fresh and the avocado's they used were ripened to perfection. The chips were freshly fried, warm thin corn chips that were enjoyable on their one. For entrees we decided to share so we could try even more. Beef tenderloin tacos, El Diablo chicken pasta and the three mushroom enchilada in a mole sauce. I don't even know how to describe the tacos. The seasoning, the chipotle pomegranate marinade, the sauce and fried peppers! FRIED PEPPERS! The texture combination in this alone makes it better than almost everyone else tacos, but then add beef tenderloin, so tender it melts in your mouth. The sauce and gorganzola crumbles add layers of flavor that really plays off the palette. And it was all on homemade tortillas! The Diablo pasta was garnished with fresh jalapenos that added crunch and enough spicy to the already flavorful cream sauce. Our chicken was perfectly grilled, and the plating was jaw dropping. The mushroom enchiladas were wonderful too. Not covered or overstuffed with cheese, but stuffed with mushrooms! The mole sauce was sweet but not like overbearing. It matched heat of the dish nicely. Rice was super fluffy and cooked jusy right and the beans aren't normal Mexican restaurant pinto beans. These were slow cooked, delicious beans that could have been a dish all on its own. Definitely be back and it more than worth a drive for those tacos. Mind blowing.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I have been using the Yelp app for years to help me locate good food joints throughout the country as I'm a frequent traveler. I have never felt the urge to leave a review, until now. I stumbled upon the gem as I arrived into past normal dinner hours. The previous reviews all spoke highly so I was motivated to try this place. First, don't be alarmed by the humble building. This place is about food not architecture. With that said, it's very clean. I ordered a chicken enchiladas and mushroom enchilada. In any restaurant the Chicken Enchilada would have been great. In this restaurant it was just \"good\" because I paired it with the Mushroom Enchilada which was fantastic! I was second guessing myself before ordering it because it had no meat. Don't let that deter you. The flavor is worth it and it was packed just as full as my chicken enchilada. The co-owner was very friendly. He took time to (actually) sit and discuss items on the menu. Once I had finished eating, he asked for comments, suggestions, etc. Absolutely no ego. The other co-owner is the chef and it's clear he has experience at high level restaurants. The food is too original, flavorful and perhaps intelligent for him not to have experience with putting together a menu. If you are looking for authentic flavors and quality food, you must try this place.",

Previous reviewers were 100% correct! Excellent staff, friendly casual atmosphere, and best of all high quality \"authentic\" mexican food (we lived in the interior of Mexico in Sinaloa, so we have some expertise). These guys are new and my guess is with \"word-of-mouth\" spreading there will soon be long lines waiting a seat; particularly during snowbird season.. The 14 mile trip from Ahwatukee will not be a deterrent ... we'll be back for sure. Gracias y Buena Suerte!",

I was leaning toward the Hatch Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas, but when I found out I could mix and match the taco trio, I went for the Oaxaca Shrimp, achiote  Chicken and the Beef Tenderloin with crispy chili's.  Happy Happy!  And the side of beans and rice are no afterthought; great flavors!   We started with the guacamole which comes with a generous helping of chips and salsa and was delivered to the table by Chef Madrigal himself.  If you like an extra kick, ask him for the Habenero salsa.  Great heat AND great flavor.  What s great find!   I still need to try those hatch chili enchilada - guess I'll have to go back - GLADLY!",

My girlfriend loves Mexican food, but she absolutely detests onions. At nearly any other restaurant, that would pose as a problem. No worries here though.... owner/chef Leo was totally willing to alter his recipes to satisfy her \"needs\". Yesterday and today, we kicked it off with the Appetizer Trio. The Oaxaca Fundido is outstanding, and it was served still bubbling in the skillet. While the ultimate goal is to try EVERYTHING on the menu, we can't seem to deviate from the enchiladas. The Wild Mushroom Enchiladas are top-notch. We have tried them with both the mole sauce and the Hatch Green Chile sauce, and the judges are still out on which one was better. For dessert, the churros are a MUST. If you are anything like us, you will totally toggle with the idea of DRINKING the leftover creme anglaise once you eat the last one! Even though we just discovered Casa Madrigal, we have already told everyone we know about it, and we plan to bring all of our out-of-town visitors here too.",

I'm glad we live out in Verrado or we would be here twice a week.        I want you to imagine a three mushroom enchilada. With a sauce so velvety and the fresh made tortillas so soft it all just melts in your mouth. How about a barbacoa pork enchilada that is totally off the hook good. And all of these enchiladas have about 4 times as much stuffing as a normal average enchilada. And the sauces are simply divine. Not at all like what you are used to. This is the real deal. Gourmet Mexican food that you only get in really upscale restaurants in Mexico normally.      But let me tell you about the fresh made guacamole! Order it with the roasted Serranos. Talk about an explosion in your mouth. Ok maybe we will go back tomorrow. Chips and tortillas are made fresh. Why wait? Beat the rush. Go now.      Now for my one suggestion. I want my Margarita in a big fancy glass with two shots of good tequila. Priced accordingly. Their michalada's are excellent no matter what beer you select.",

    "text": "Let me preface with this. I'm not a big fan of sitting down to eat with a waiter. I don't like going to fancy restaurants and spending a lot of money. Honestly, I'm extremely cheap, I want a lot of food for as little money as possible. So this was NOT my decision. I had seen the place before but when I looked it up it was all 3 things I don't want... But my brother was adamant, said he'd pay, that I had to try it. He knows I'm big on Mexican food, I try most of the places in the city at least once when I'm hungry and nearby.   So when I tell you this was amazing, I'm not blowing smoke up their ass. I already showed you that I went into this place already skeptical. How could 3 tacos beans and rice come out to 12+ a plate? BECAUSE THEY'RE THAT FUCKING GOOD, THAT'S WHY! When you use premium ingredients, things are gonna cost more. There's nowhere else in the city that you're gonna get this much flavor and quality in general. To top that, those 3 tacos are pretty big and you get a decent side of beans and rice(quantity, the quality is amazing).  We had the al pastor, chicken, and Asada tacos. The last one normally comes with gorgonzola but I'm a traditionalist so I requested they use the Oaxaca cheese instead. Listen, the fact they even have Oaxaca cheese tells you they're legit. None of this cheddar shit or a mix of cheeses. That's the worst thing you can do to my Mexican food, use American cheeses, should be sacrilegious. I'm going off topic, let's get back on track. So the al pastor was really good, had a little sweetness with a lil spice. The chicken was moist and tender, the steak was amazing. All the other ingredients compliment the meats.  Finally, let's talk about the staff. We caught Eduardo at the end of his shift, was more than willing to stay late to take care of us. Matt had him the first time he went with his wife, raved about the service. Needless to say, he and the women working up front were all very professional yet gregarious. Eduardo was also fluent in Spanish, has a lot of charisma. Great guy, even gave us some chips and salsa(which were fantastic). Gotta take care of him or the ladies if you come in, they'll make you feel at home.  Oh yeah, let's talk about location. It's not the biggest parking lot but being full really shows the food is worth it. Outside its fairly unassuming but you get in and it has a little flair. Nice bar, nice decor, like 4 quality TVs playing sports. It's just a nice lil spot you wouldn't expect to be as cool/good as it is. I give other places 5s but that's more based on all around price quantity-quality all mixed together. This was 5s across the board. Truly stands out, prolly the best in the city(or close to it). It's a new restaurant so take your friends and family, they deserve all the business they can get...",

I'm not even a big Mexican food fan because so many places have rice, beans, and food that tastes the same. This place has food with beautiful appearance, incredible taste, and top notch customer service. I've been here multiple times since my first recent visit; I now take clients and friends here regularly. The owner Leo frequently talks to the customers to thank them for their business, and all the employees answer any drink or food questions with ease. In the past I've been a only a burrito or fajita guy, and this place has resulted in me trying the tacos (incredible), churros (amazing), and appetizers (try all of them!). This place is a True diamond in the rough and easily one of the best restaurants in all of Arizona",

A modest building in little remote neighborhood but walk in and its hipster central. Will come back!",

Highlights-  Oaxaca Fundido Wild Mushroom Enchilada  Beef Tenderloin steak taco Oaxaca shrimp taco Fresh made corn tortillas  We usually never order desserts, but it was my husband's  birthday so we got the churros and chocolate chipotle cake (because who can decide?)!  The churros were so warm and delicious with a sweet cream dipping sauce. But the chocolate chipotle cake was out of this world!   Finally- the service was exceptional. We came at an off hour and the chef came to talk to each table. Our waitress efficiently provided refills on drinks, chips, salsa. All the staff gave the impression that we were valued guests.

The stand-alone building was fairly humble, the quality of the service was highly personable and the food was absolutely amazing. From appetizers to desert, everything was phenomenal. Fish Tacos, Shrimp Tacos, Mushroom Enchiladas (which is saying a lot since i'm mostly carnivorous) all had the perfect amount of spice for the extra bit of kick, but not overly so that you couldn't tell how fresh the ingredients were. I ordered a Pizza Port chronic ale which although is usually a heavier beer than i like to get with Mexican food had a sweetness and nuttiness that paired well with both the food and desert.",

Try the Mushroom enchiladas (trussssttt..) and don't be an idiot and order ANY other app besides the Trio.

The service here was spectacular - the server was attentive, answered our questions, and checked back frequently to make sure everything was all right.   The food here was good, but not the best. I ordered 3 tacos - shrimp, fish, and steak. I've had better tacos around the neighborhood and back in New York. The creative flavor choices came as a delightful surprise, but were not harmonious enough to put me over the edge. The fish tacos are unexpectedly spicy, and the blue cheese on the steak tacos are an interesting choice. If you're looking for recommendations, I'd go with the shrimp. It's juicy, and the mix of toppings were modest - not too salty, sweet nor spicy.",

However, I am rarely in that neighborhood and I had heard such great things from my Fellow Foodies.Can you say leftovers expected? Teehee!  I mean, how could I not stop by when every one of my Foodies tell me it it great. After all, it is rated as a top restaurant in America. So, I was skeptical because I never thought Z-Tejas was much to write home about. Also, I am not a fan usually, of Mexican food.  The place is darling. It is an understated cute to theme. More plain to Barebones but appropriate to genre. I think it was an old house before, at least that is what the server told me.  The service was amazing. They made me feel like family. Yarelli, I think she said her name was, was my server. There was also a man there who thanked me. He was very outgoing to all the customer too. I was very impressed with the service. Ya know, I felt like I was at a house in Mexico visiting relatives. It has that type of feel to it. The outside is cute with the twinkly lights. Parking is a bit challenging. The lot is kind of small but the place is not a large eatery.   The food is really great! I ordered the Serrano Guacamole and the Elote and it was fantastic!  I hear the Enchiladas here are out of this world. Next time. The Elote was beyond amazing to me. I really liked their chips and salsa too. They do have an interesting menu. They have potato cakes ( My favorite food ever)  and sandwiches too. A return trip is a must to try other items from their eclectic menu.   Over all a great new find! Wish it was closer to home.

The clear best part was the $8.95 homemade Guacamole. I had some carmelized pineapple on the side, but it's not needed. The second best dish was desert which was a delicious homemade coconut cream pie served with homemade whipped cream.  The mexican rice was fluffy and decent, but the pinto beans were salty and hard to eat. Wild Mushroom Enchiladas - these had an addicting sauce, homemade corn tortillas and alot of sauteed mushrooms. Tacos - probably a bit overpriced as you mix and match 3 for $16. The flank steak was good, but undercooked and the shrimp tacos had great flavor.     The menu is a bit small, but definitely some gems to be found here.",

    "text": "Visited this place for dinner, it's literally walking distance from my home, and a good friend had suggested I try it. Well, I did and honestly it wasn't bad but truly didn't meet my dining expectations. The environment was pleasant, friendly staff and a simple menu. The music was not crazy loud and easy to have a conversation with friends or a date.   I want to be fair with my review and I must say...this place clearly knows who they cater too. This place has excellent rice, nasty beans, average burritos with a very delightful enchilada sauce but in the end...the \"El Pastor\" burrito was not something I would eat again. The Mac n cheese with grilled chicken was much better but my 13 year old didn't like it. I did however and ended up eating his dish but he didn't like the burrito.  The lights kept surging and I was worried about a blackout...it is monsoon season. We were seated quickly,  the server was very nice and brought us drinks  on request. It seemed like 10-15 minutes went by until we were seen again. It was enough time however to get a deeper feel to the environment. It was not surprising to hear the \"in my country they are called cenote line\" this clown used his accent voice and totally entertained the older non-latino guests...guess who he looked right at and just kept walking??  Yup, this guy! I am happy he did...it would have been an insult to my Mexican background.   In my other posts I've never left a place without reviewing the facilities...the rest room was clean, stocked but it really smelled and could use proper ventilation.   Our server was very polite, he did an awesome job (after everyone walked pass us for 10 or more minutes) he totally redeemed himself and I want him to know that he made my great servers list.  So, if you are in the area stop and judge for yourself. The price was high for the food portion and it seemed like food truck service in a slightly higher class environment. The Hispanic guy with the dark chef outfit and mustache sure is entertaining but so is the little monkey who tilts it's hat when you give him a coin at the carnival.   This place is not one that I would return to and it's a shame because it's literally within walking distance from my home.  P.S. I did enjoy the salsa and chips...try both the regular and habbanero salsa.",

Being the local guy, I looked up closest authentic Mexican restaurants and Cochina Madrigal came up.  The host/server was kind and helpful. We had an appetizer of the chips, salsa and some guacamole made right on site. It was excellent.  The tastes of the salsas and guacamole was great.   For lunch I had two enchiladas- one mushroom mole and one Barbados green chili. Wow. They were very good. For desert we had some coconut pie and Bavarian cream churros.  Again, excellent.   The restaurant also has a bar inside and outdoor seating for nice days.   The staff was very kind and the chef came out to meet us and explain the dishes. Overall, it was a really great experience.  I will be back.",

This wasn't as spicy as the street tacos we had in Cancun, but it was definitely flavorful. You could taste the mesquite and the jalapeno cilantro dressing was just right. Even the cherry tomatoes were grilled! And they were those fancy tri-color mix. My co-worker had enchiladas and they let her get one chicken and one barbacoa. With rice and beans, it was enough for two meals. My other co worker built his own chicken burrito, it was awesome and huge, another two parter. The seasoning is perfect and wrk balanced, spicy but flavorful, they are not trying to melt your face! We all had a hard time making up our minds, so it's definitely being bookmarked for a return visit.",

I can tell you I have hated enchiladas my whole life. Don't know what's wrong with me but just do not enjoy. However the mushroom enchilada was just amazing and may have restored my faith in trying enchiladas when I go out. Now the most amazing thing of the afternoon was the tenderloin taco. It was so tender and flavorful with the crispy peppers it was awesome. Now when I saw Gorgonzola on a taco it sounded so wrong but I'm glad I tried it cause boy was it so right. I'm having a hard time remembering a better taco. My wife and I had to drive 45 min to get here but it's so good we will be back and won't mind the drive at all it is so worth it. Last note the service staff was just as awesome. They really took care of us from start to finish without a single problem.

It is humble, but the service was amazing and the food was incredible.  Started with a margarita, chips, incredible salsa, and freshly made guacamole.  I ordered the wild mushroom enchiladas and they were easily the best enchiladas that I have ever eaten in my life.  The staff was accommodating and attentive, and if I did not live in Gilbert we would be coming here every week.  You will not be disappointed!  It is not the Scottsdale restaurant scene as far as ambience, but the food is tremendous!  Try it!",

The praise for the CM team was unanimous. Two of our party from Scottsdale said they would drive the 40 minutes to eat here again. Every dish, every experience has been just terrific. Strongly recommend Cocina Madrigal.",

    "text": "I can't say enough good things about this place. First of all, the steak tacos were literally the best tacos I have ever had in my life. The meat was so soft, present in every bite, & it also had tempura'd vegetable, blue cheese, & lightly had delicious sauce in it. Everything was homemade and prefect, even the tortilla. There was absolutely no dripping sauce or oil, so it is not only delicious, but definitely more healthy than most tacos I have eaten. Even the beans and rice that it comes with are seasoned just right. I ate them even though I never usually eat rice & beans, because they were that good. Their elote was also delicious. I had the churros for dessert, & they were stuffed with Bavarian cream & mexican caramel. Everything was the best, & definitely worth the price. On top of amazing food, Jasmine & the chef were above and beyond in their service. Jasmine gave amazing recommendations and attentive service. The chef clearly takes so much pride in his work, because he takes the time to hear feedback. He was great to talk to and very friendly. It is very refreshing to encounter those types of people. I will definitely recommend this to everyone and take all my friends here.",

Very few owners do that and this one did show his appreciation for the uncommon wait we had to do to get our food. He quickly explained that he was unexpectedly short handed and well that's totally understandable. The fact that his employees and he in particular took the time to apologize and make it right said wonders about him and the quality of his work.  We will definitely be back!",

Main courses were fish tacos, beef enchiladas, and achiote chicken burrito. Appetizer the trio and dessert the churros. Flavors were well balanced and worked well. Nothing was over seasoned. Cooked perfectly. Prices were above average, but considering what the owner is trying to achieve I understand but not agree. Portions, staff, chef/owner was great. The 4 stars is based on the achiote burrito. Buying it the way it is sold might be great but I pass on the rice and cheese. The flavor then was good but not great. It seems the items in the dish could not be independent of each other when it comes to flavor.",

If you like guacamole you won't find any place in Phoenix that does it better.  Back to the beef tenderloin tacos, they're one of the best tacos that I have ever had. This place is super unassuming off the street and would probably have a line out the door if it wasn't in South Mountain. But if you're reading this review and you are willing to make the drive - DO IT!  Lastly, the service here is phenomenal to the point you and whomever you are with will make note of it.",

We were not disappointed.   We were greeted by friendly faces, a (sweet surprise) complimentary guacamole, chips, and salsa.  The chips were light and crispy.    The salsa was delicious.   Nice flavor and a lil heat.  We devoured the chips, and salsa.  And then polished off the guacamole, that we found out isn't made until you order.   I loved the roasted pineapple guacamole.  Will be ordering that again.     If you are a mushroom lover, I would recommend the wild mushroom enchiladas.  They are loaded with mushrooms, accented by cheese, and topped with a ancho cream sauce that will send you to enchilada heaven.  They were the best enchiladas I have ever had.  My husband had the seasonal veggie burrito, and let me have a bite.  The veggies were cooked perfect, and the green sauce was flavorful.  Overall a bright, and flavorful dish.  But the mushroom enchiladas were the shining star to me.   Dropped in today headed home from work.  This will be our 4th/5th time here. Today we had Leo's hot salsa.  Wooo did that have a delicious donkey kick!  It was flavorful but had that punch of hot salsa that I love.  I kept going back to the original then to this hotter one.  Both are fantastic, and I love having a spicier option when i'm wanting the heat and the flavor punch!  I tried the raspberry brandy liquor frozen margarita.   WOW it was delicious.  I will be ordering that next time, AND the next time.  The contrast in the flavors of the lime, and raspberry was phenomenal.      Ordered the shrimp tacos.  The shrimp in the tacos are so yummy buttery (yes, yummy buttery) and the tacos are so so flavorful. Ive ordered these the last two times.  Def becoming my second go to favorite dish here.",

The food is authentic, delicious, and greatly priced. Mushrooms enchiladas and elote on the cob are a dishes not to be missed, but you won't be disappointed whatever you pick. The ambience is laid back and very friendly, just like Mexico! The staff is really accommodating and truly care about your experience. The chef comes out to greet people and say hello, which is a very nice touch. Drinks are very good too - My fiancee says her Margarita was excellent!

Easily the best corn tortillas ever and the steak tenderloin was cooked to perfection.  We started with guacamole and fundido for appetizers.  The guacamole was so smooth and lacked nothing.  The fundido was delicious filled with mushrooms and accompanied by fresh tortillas.  Our waitress was extremely busy, but kind and attentive.  We really enjoyed our visit from the chef.. so gracious.  We will return for sure!",

    "text": "Ok. If there was a 6, I would surely give it.  First, let's talk about the food. On the advice of many others here, we had the guacamole with roasted pineapple. You have GOT to try this! I have never had guac this way. The waitress said, she has had guac with orange slices in it too. That would be good too. But seriously, if you come to this place, you have to get this.  I had the enchilada plate. For the last 50 years or so that I have been eating mexican food, I have had a big preference for cheese enchiladas. They didn't have cheese enchiladas, so I had to choose what they had. I couldn't decide so, I had both the barbacoa one with green chili sauce, and the wild mushroom one with the mole cream sauce. They were both great, but I will let y'all in on a little secret - the mushroom one was way tastier! Now, when I come back, that will be my GO TO plate.  My wife had the Chicken Stack. She said it was great. But after a bit of plate envy at another customers table, she wishes she had gotten the fish and shrimp tacos instead. Next time.  We finished off with coconut pie, because everyone raved about it. If you don't like lots of coconut then don't get this. It was so dense, it reminded me of cheesecake. Yummy! What a way to end the meal.  The waitress and staff were VERY attentive, my glass of tea hardly ever saw the bottom.  The only drawback was it was a bit noisy. Not so that I won't come again, mind you. But as I get older, noise bothers me.  This is NOT, I repeat NOT in a bad part of town. So don't let that stop you from coming here. You MUST try this place.  Leo Madrigal, who is I think, the owner, came to our table at the end, and wanted to know where we lived, and how we liked it. He said, he makes sure EVERYTHING is fresh.  And I would say that it is.  Again, come to this place!",

Food was so bland, kept wondering if the cook was sad:(...There is a saying in the Hispanic/ Latino community that if dish had no salt, the cook was sad:(..... Me believes that was the case on the evening me and my daughter visited.  My daughter had a \"make your own burro\" of steak, rise and beans. No flavor! Bland, bland, Bland!!! Had to keep adding salt and pepper for flavor and taste!!!!  I had the chicken tortillas soup. Soup was so thick, could not see all the avacado in the soup!! Which was a good thing, there was only a very small piece of chicken in the soup. I counted 12 tortillas strips!!! WOW!  SO SO BLAND!! Once again had to add a lot of salt and pepper. Ordered a side of guacamole, OMG!!!, There was so much purple onion in the guacamole, never tasted the avacado, the sweetness of the purple onion over powered the the bland taste of the guacamole!!! Again had to add salt and pepper to get flavor in the guacamole!!  Por Favor mijo, give the cook the night off, a tissue and a shot of tequilla!! Let him cry out his sorrows before you let him back in the kitchen!!!! Again I believe the cook was feeling sad and probably not in the mood to cook!!!  When a cook in the mood, LOOK OUT!!! The cook will add his/her joy of life to the dish!! Truth!! UNA GRAN VERDAD!!!! This establishment is not for me!!! Will not be going there again and will leave empty my table for someone that enjoys bland Hispanic/Latino food. Provecho!!!!....and please keep the salt and pepper shakers full!!!!",

The owner came by multiple times to talk to us and we enjoyed conversing with him very much. We ordered the Trio appetizer and were blown away by the fundido that came with it. The house-made tortillas are to die for as well. By the time our entrees came around we were pretty full off of chips, salsa, fundido, and guacamole, but they were delicious as well. My boyfriend got a taco plate and was pleasantly surprised when they were loaded up and weren't skimpy like street tacos often look. It's a shame we were too full for dessert. We will be back soon!",

I've had some pretty crappy Mexican food in Phoenix before, but this place is a world of difference. It's a little small, but it was a nice low key atmosphere. Their menu is streamlined, so you won't find everything here,  but what they serve is all top notch. I was hoping they had fajitas (they didn't), but that was my fault for not checking the menu, so I can't fault them for that since you can see their menu online.   Between the 8 of us, we ordered just about everything on the menu. We had the steak tacos, the fish tacos, the soup, burritos, and the churros. Everything was mouth wateringly good.

We tried Cocina Madrigal based on all of the 5 star Yelp reviews, and expected a good, local 'hole in the wall' Mexican restaurant, and when pulling up, it does have that type of feel.  Eduardo waited on us, and he was so passionate and knowledgeable about the menu, I assumed he was the owner.  Turns out he is the manager, but should absolutely have his own restaurant!  He spent probably 10 minutes with us reviewing the menu, making lots of recommendations, of which we all took.  For starters we had the Trio (guacamole, salsa and queso fundido..so good).  I had 3 tacos, all of which were gourmet (Pastor, Fish and Tenderloin..the last being my favorite) plus their wild mushroom enchilada, which was amazing.  My wife had barbacoa and chicken enchiladas, both were excellent.  The owner/chef was there, and came over to visit with us a bit, very nice man.  This is a restaurant that we will 100% visit again on our next trip!",

They get people driving Mercedes Benz and BMWs and Phoenix's finest motorcycle cops in there so you know these people know something. We started out with the Fundido for an appetizer and it was so flavorful and slightly spicy and was so good. I had the Tropical fish tacos for my entree and she had the steak tacos and we both really enjoyed them. I had a frozen raspberry margarita and she ordered a pineapple margarita and it wasn't on the menu but they made her one on the rocks and she loved it. I also ordered the Churros and those were warm and cream filled and absolutely amazing. My date texted me on her way to the restaurant that she didn't like the location where the restaurant because she thought it was not in a good location and we were both very pleasantly surprised how nice the restaurant is both inside and out on the patio. The owner of the restaurant stopped by our table to see how our meals were and was very friendly to us. I thought that was so nice of him, it just goes to show you the kind of man he is as a business owner. My date and I both decided that we will go back to Cocina Madrigal and I am excited to try their enchiladas.",

Must try: the Trio (the Oaxaca Fundido was very unique), Al Pastor Tacos (mouth-watering and out of this world!), Chicken enchiladas (the meat was sooo tender) Grilled elote (tasty but could use some kick) and of course the Churros!

Diana was our waitress the last time we went. She is AMAZING!   You MUST eat here.",

I got the chicken and beef enchiladas and he got the steak burrito and both were absolutely delicious and very authenticity home made. Got to meet the owner of the place and heard some history as he greeted everyone. Have to say I was lost for work on this place and will definitely be returning again with family. I recommend this place to everyone if you want a mama kitchen food. Being Hispanic and love to cook I will take the time to go here again.",

Definitely not disappointed. Cocina Magrigal is in a spot of town you wouldn't expect to get such great food or have an experience like this. The owner will come out and greet you warmly and talk about the food. You won't feel rushed, more welcomed than anything as if you were a guest in someone's home. It was a lovely time with our friends as we enjoyed our meals and each other's company. As a vegetarian I was excited to have several options and can't wait to go back and try a few different items. Everyone at our table enjoyed their meals very much. Thank you Cocina Madrigal!",

Fresh salsa and guacamole, the elote is just a single large corn on the cob grilled; very good, highly recommend. We ordered a build your own burrito with the chicken, not spicy, but good. Two orders of the al pastor tacos, one with flour tortilla and the other on lettuce cups. After a few bites, had some tears bc it was a little spicy! Everything was great!",

How is it that I could pass a restaurant this amazing and this popular as often as I have in the year it has been open and I not realize it!  I'm baffled by it.  I think I know why.... South Phoenix.... Modest building....  Assumption made....  Can't be that good....  Well, I say, \"assume\" something and you make an ASS out of U and ME!  Clearly, I made an ASS outta someone since I judged this resto by it's \"cover\"!  I am excited about the fact that I turned the pages and found what's inside Cocina Madrigal to be well worth the 5 star rating.   The June International Supper Club UYE was held here, at Cocina Madrigal.  Several of us were seated at a booth/table combination.  We learned that happy hour was shortened and now ends at 6 pm instead of 6:30.  That was fine.  Several folks ordered appetizers.  I sampled the salsa and  Oaxaca Fundido.   The Oaxaca Fundido is a fairly spicy cheesey dip that can be eaten with tortillas or chips or without either.  Since I practice a low carb lifestyle, it was a pretty decent option without the chips -melted cheese with sausage, peppers and onions.  That was so delicious, I know I will order it the next time I stop by for lunch or dinner.  For dinner I had the Grilled Romaine Salad with Steak.  The salad had the perfect blend of bacon and cheese, and charred lettuce and sweet tomatoes.  While the salad could stand alone and be sufficient by it self, the standout star of my meal was the Steak.  The steak was flavorful and seasoned to absolute perfection!  It was succulent, moist and tender.  I could not have asked for a more perfect choice to top my salad!  I can't wait to return.  I'd like my own bowl of Oaxaca Fundido!  Lol.  I don't think I'll be sharing that the next time!  Buen Provecho!  Return Factor:100%",

    "text": "When my hubby found this 5 star Mexican restaurant on Yelp, we knew we had to check it out.  We weren't the only ones at the bar with the same idea.  There was a man on a business trip and a couple that had driven from Mesa to check this place out.  It was absolutely worth the drive because everything we tried was exceptional.  Thomas the bartender greeted us almost immediately and made us some mean margaritas.  He recommended the fresh guacamole with only \"whole fresh ingredients\" (his words).  It came with salsa as well.  It was chunky and very flavorful.  I ordered tacos: al pastor, shrimp, and fish.  There was a nice char on the shrimp and they were cooked perfectly.  I'm not a rice fan, so I asked for double beans instead.  Thomas suggested I sub one of the beans for an order of roasted vegetables.  I'm so glad he recommended that.  I could eat those veggies as my main meal any day!  Hubby was very satisfied in the juiciness of the chicken in his burrito.  The couple next to us ordered the churros for dessert, but they couldn't eat them all, so they offered to share with us.  Who could turn down a churro filled with Bavarian cream?!  Not I!  I'm used to churros that I get sick of after a few bites because they are so dry, but these were the opposite.  The cream on the inside and the optional dipping sauce made these very moist and enjoyable.  Your meal will not be complete without the churros.",

We were offered the hot salsa but didn't have the guts to try it   The entrees can definitely be shared! They're huge! I ordered the taco plate with house made corn tortillas. I had the steak taco, chicken and a shrimp taco. My boyfriend tried the chicken, fish and shrimp tacos. We loved every single one but the steak one by far stood out the most! The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, loved the fried onions that accompanied the tacos, l loved the cheese on it (Gorgonzola maybe). Man, they were good. Next time I'll be sure to get 2.   We missed happy hour by 15 mins so we paid regular price ($9) but they were sooooooooo good. I MUST return soon!",

    "text": "Wow! The food at Cocina Madrigal is amazing and divine! My wife and I recently visited for dinner and started with the Trio, which is an assortment three appetizers. The first appetizer was the Chips & Salsa which was a solid start to the meal with crisp tortilla chips and fresh flavorful salsa. The second appetizer was the Guacamole de Casa. The guacamole was creamy with fresh-diced onions, tomatoes, and jalapenos. The final appetizer was the Oaxaca Fundido. This addictive dish was basically a melty cheese dip (Oaxaca Cheese) filled with tender mushrooms, meaty local sausage, and caramelized onions. For the entree I had some of the best enchiladas I have ever tried: the Wild Mushroom and Barbacoa Green Chile Enchiladas. A soft warm tortilla was filled with juicy tender mushrooms and topped with a creamy flavorful mole sauce. The other enchilada was filled with rich tender beef and topped with a lightly spicy green chile sauce. Overall, this was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had.  Cocina Madrigal will be my first stop next time I'm in Phoenix.",

We decided to try it the next day around 4:00 and no problem. We sat at bar and got great service from Daniel. He recommended a dish for my husband that turned out to be too spicy for him. Daniel informed manager who insisted on having a different entree prepared for him. It was the mushroom enchilada. What a treat!  Everyone extremely friendly and helpful. This is our go to Mexican restaurant from now on. Thank you, Eduardo.",

I could honestly say we were the only mexicans in the establishment and were treated with less attentiveness then all the other non-Mexican people ,remember this is a Mexican food restaurant. I was there with my family try this 5 star place it was a party of 4. We were served by Jasmin I believe and as soon as a larger party showed up we never saw her again we saw a gentlemen that was left in charge but had no idea of what was going on and one nore girl that i didnt get her name. Well we order chips and guac to start they never made it to pur table but the white cuple that had just sat down gpr their chips and guac ASAP and i mean ASAP but not us. My son had asked for side of beans, also never made it only mines did so he stayed waiting we asked for limes never made it and when I adressed this to them they just said sorry and when on to continue tp help her larger party. The food is not great and its not authentic Mexican food, beans are from can and salsa is from a tostitos jar. If you like and know mexican food you will know this is not the place for you.  Si eres hispano no apoyes este lugar. Usan nuestra cultura y nuestros sabores para americanos Y despues nos tartan como que estorbamos y no nos quieren.",

Chef Leo came by twice to say hello and make sure we were happy.  We had guacamole appetizer, burrito, mixed enchiladas, margaritas, draft beer and house made coconut cream pie to die for!  Food right down to beans and homemade chips were excellent.  Hatch Chile sauce is awesome.   I can't say enough about home great CM is!

I enjoyed the fish tacos, margaritas, and the guacamole and salsa.  The restaurant itself was clean and gives good customer service.  No changing table for babies but other than that it's casual enough for kids.  When you open the female restroom the bathroom door almost hits the toilet so I recommend not using the restroom unless you absolutely have to.  I am petite so it wasn't too bad but I can't imagine what it's like for taller people.  The parking lot is small but there is street parking surrounding the area.  I would definitely return for the guacamole!",

The Owner/Chef is a well seasoned Chef originally from Central Mexico and serves  carefully detailed Oaxaca/American Cuisine. Everything is made from scratch and tortillas are cooked to order. They offer interesting detailed food that you are not going to find at other restaurants. This is also a family friendly restaurant so that means pricing is very reasonable.  We started with Chips and Salsa. The Chips were hot and fresh and seemed free of oil. The salsa was delicious and full of flavors. It also was spicy.  For my meal I tried the Artichoke Mushroom Cilantro Pesto Marinated Chicken in Soy Mustard Cream and Pepitas. It came with fresh buttered vegetables and really great mashed potatoes. The chicken was so delicious. It was very flavorful and cooked to perfection with this delicious char. All the flavors were really great!  It doesn't say on the menu but you can mix the tacos. My husband ordered Three different tacos with rice and beans. EACH AND EVERY TACO WAS SO DETAILED. The Beef Tenderloin was marinated in  Chipotle and Pomegranate. This taco also contained fried peppers, gorgonzola cheese and fried onion straws.....This was a really detailed delicious taco. The achiote braised Chicken Taco with Menonita Cheese and the Tropical Fish Taco were great too! I'm kicking myself now for not tasting the rice and beans because my husband said they were very good. He said the rojo beans epazote were exceptional and not the usual refried beans you get everywhere else. He said these were really delicious. I will try them next time.  We had the churros for dessert. I have to say that these were the best churros I ever had. They were FRESH MADE TO ORDER and were stuffed with pastry cream and covered in just the right amount of sugar and cinnamon. They were also came with dipping cream. they were crazy good.  The whole staff and owner were very friendly and welcoming. They also wanted feedback on all their food.  This restaurant is a Great Addition to Phoenix!",

Impressive clientele for such an out of the way place. The price of the margarita seemed high (we had one each and it was 50% of the check), but the drink was expertly crafted and in a different (e.g. less casual) venue I wouldn't question the price. Anyway, it was worth it.",

On the recommendation of a friend I came here to try their wild mushroom enchilada, which came with the usual accompaniment of rice and beans. The flavors were amazing - notches above any enchilada dish I've had before, and I am a big enchilada fan. Chef Leo Madrigal really knows his stuff! The grilled elote I ordered as a side was also very good; the tender grilled sweet corn was coated with with a flavorful creamy cover that held on generously to the crumbled cojita cheese it was rolled on. My server was very friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself has a very casual atmosphere, quite relaxing even with multiple TV screens playing sports programs. Prices are good, especially considering the quality of the food. I am definitely compelled to come back; the flavors are too good not to experience again and definitely I also have to try the desserts which I did not have room for after this very satisfying meal.",

I had a hard time choosing between the shrimp and chicken tacos and after a brief convo with the manager (who waited on us because they were unexpectedly short staffed) and telling him my dilemma, he gave me a \"say no more\" look--initiative that I personally enjoy--and brought out 2 shrimp tacos and a chicken taco. They were both delicious and made with fresh tortillas, but the shrimp was my favorite. My husband ordered the al pastor burrito (one of the best he's had) and frozen margs for each of us, which didn't skimp on the tequila. The chef came out at the end to check up on us and introduce himself.  Long story short, Cocina Madrigal combines high-quality dining with a neighborhood-cafe vibe. We're so excited to have this gem in in South Phoenix and can't wait to bring people here instead of having to travel north for good food!",

Try the wild mushroom or Barbecoa Hatch green chile enchiladas. They were my favorite. Also, the guacamole appetizer is amazing--they make it fresh for you after you place the order. I plan on visiting this place regularly.",

The food is good - all of it. They came over promoting the place when it opened so we bought up a variety of things to try out, and everything, without exception, was really good. It was better three days later than most places around here are at their best. Definitely worth a shot!",

Zay was our server and did a great job. We tried the fundido, chicken quesadilla and guac/salsa appetizers. All the food was super fresh and very tasty-the real thing. Even the tortillas were amazing. Jason the general manager came by and chatted with us for a bit, as did Chef Leo. They are both very welcoming and looking for any type of feedback. This is truly a wonderful place and we will continue to visit. Can't wait to bring our out of town friends there next time they visit. This is a must try place.",

It's a cute humble place from the outside and when you step inside you are immediately greeted with a smile.  Their made to order Guacamole was done with just the right amount of chiles so it's not too spicy but a great sabor.  I had an enchilada de pollo in hatch green chile sauce that was beautifully done!  I also had an enchilada de birria that was insane.  The meat was so juicy and the sauce...spicy and balanced perfectly.  I'm super picky about rice and I loved theirs.  That's very rare for me.  The churros with creme anglais...I thought I was going to cry they were so good.  They took me back to so many happy memories of Mexico.  Thank you so much for all of the love you put into your food.  It truly shines through.  I'll be back to try everything on the menu.",

We first ordered the guacamole with caramelized pineapple... pretty darn good. Then the dinner menu was amazing....I ordered the mango steak salad.... the steak was so tender and juicy and the mango combined with the sweet/salty/spicy pecans added so much flavor and uniqueness, every bite was different. My son ordered the beef tacos and said they were the best taco's he has ever had. His friend ordered the mushroom enchilada's and said they were fantastic. He said he's not a mushroom person, but the menu description made him curious to order them.... he could have easily licked his plate. Then we all shared a churro cream dessert. To die for...... there was leftover cream and I used my finger to try to get the last bite (I know, gross) but I should have asked for a spoon to get the last remains. Also the Margarita's were AMAZING. Everything on this menu was spectacular.... we did meet the humble Chef, but I didn't even ask his name.  Next time in town, I'll ask and order something different, just so I can explore the other dishes.  This place is the real deal.  Great food, great service and wonderful Chef.",

Let me just say this for starters....it was well worth the trip. Looks very unassuming from the outside and the inside was not fancy at all but the food and staff were both FANTASTIC! Went with a party of 6 and were greeted by a very friendly hostess. Waitress was also super nice, attentive and helpful with everyone's choices. We had 2 appetizers the bacon jalapeno guacamole and the Oaxaca con Queso.  Wow. These both blew us away with flavors and freshness. Most of us had frozen margaritas with the apps and our group raves about them too. Then came the entree's. Everyone ordered something different and I watched as each person took their first bite and the happy look on their faces. We all tasted little bites of each and not a single one was less than really delicious. Then came dessert which was their version of Churros and also a slice of Coconut cream pie. We split it up between us and once again the smiles were on everyone's faces. Top this off with really reasonable prices and you have a winning combo for sure. The owner came by several times and talked with us before and after dinner and he was very genuinely happy that we came so far to try his food. We assured we would be back often. Wherever you are in the valley it's worth the trip to come to this little gem in S. Phoenix. Can't wait to return and try more of their delicious food. Finally have found a unique Mexican inspired restaurant that is affordable and one that any foodie would enjoy!",

Finally my roommate suggested we try it and we arrived to a full parking lot which was a great indicator for the beginning of the evening. We were promptly greeted and seated in a nearly full restaurant. A young lady came to the table and offered to get our drinks and chips and salsa. As she walked away our server, Eduardo, came to the table to say he was taking care of another table but would be right over. We got our waters and freshly fried chips and salsa. The chips were light with a perfect balance of salt and weren't saturated in oil. The salsa was a great balance of heat, acid and salt.   Eduardo came to the table, welcomed us and covered the menu in great detail. He suggested the Al Pastor taco, Oaxaca Shrimp taco, Beef Tenderloin taco and wild mushroom enchiladas as things he regularly eats himself. We ordered guacamole and funditito with sides habanero carrot hot sauce and hatch green chili sauce. The flavors of all were fantastic and we quickly emptied the first basket of chips. I decided to take his recommendation and ordered the tacos.   They came out very quickly and I tried a single piece of each protein. The flavors of each were distinct and unique. The al pastor was hands down my favorite with its crisp exterior, fantastic seasoning and moist center. Eduardo was attentive and made sure we had full drinks and chips. He asked how it tasted and we couldn't help but gush over how happy we were with the food and service. After a short time passed and we were slowing down he brought out a single wild mushroom enchilada for us to try. Even though we had reached what we thought was our limit to what we could we eat we took a bite and found an amazing blend of umami and vibrant chili flavors. As we had our leftovers boxed the owner/chef came to our table to see how we were doing. He had been visiting each table in the dining room and making sure each customer was satisfied. We talked about his time with corporate restaurants and his fusion of Mexican flavors with untraditional applications like pasta. We were thanked for coming in with hand shakes and invitations to come back to which we happily accepted.   The food, atmosphere and staff are beyond expectation. We plan to come back on a regular basis and try something different each time",

My husband and I often eat out due to my crazy schedule, and it's one of the few times we have to relax and connect.  We first tried Cocina Madrigal because of neighbors praising it on Nextdoor.  We have been 3 times in the past 2.5 weeks, and all I can say is - WOW.  The food is consistently awesome.  Not good, not great - amazing.  Drinks are cold and delicious.  Chef Leo clearly takes pride in his work; chips come out heated, plating is gorgeous, servers take your leftovers (if there are any!) to the back to package for you to take home.  This is truly a local gem, I am so happy they move into the neighborhood.  We have had the opportunity to speak with Chef Leo a couple times during our visits, he is still making lots of changes and refinements to the menu and genuinely solicits feedback.  Same for the manager, Jason.  All in all an incredibly friendly place that leaves both your tummy and your heart happy.  While my business isn't in the restaurant industry, it is a service business and I know first hand how hard it is to create a high-performing team like the one at Cocina Madrigal.  Major props to all of the staff, their teamwork and passion shows.  Can't wait to go again and try something else new off of the menu!",

Can't recommend this restaurant enough!!",

    "text": "The staff and food at Cocina Madrigal is a breath of fresh air in a city with a high Latino population, where culturally appropriated \"Mexican Restaurants\" with their hispter vibes receive much of the praise in Phoenix.  I went on day I was recovering from being sick so I was avoiding most foods. I had the guacamole and chicken tortilla soup, which wasn't chicken at all. The guacamole was made fresh, and maintained its creamy texture with all the typical flavors. The soup, is actually pork based, but provided a unique smoky flavor to dish. My boyfriend had the steak burrito which he loved. I tried his rice and beans and I was impressed with the flavor and kick in the beans you don't typically get.   Finally, we met Leo, the chef and owner. He checked on us multiple times and wanted our honest opinions. As a family owned restaurant I love the commitment they make to customers and receiving feedback so they can welcome you back again. He told us about the freshness of the margaritas, they don't use ice in their frozen ones, and that you can taste the tequila bc they put more when it's frozen unlike other restaurants. For that reason, the limit is 3. If a restaurant has a limit on their specialty drink, it's probably really good. Finally, Leo gave us some churros on the house. THESE ARE THE BEST CHURROS IVE HAD TO DATE. My boyfriend who can't get enough churros since I introduced them to him, was ecstatic.   We will be back to enjoy the margs for sure, and try their tacos which look amazing. Support this local business, they deserve it.",

My partner ordered the tacos - which he said were awesome, and  I ordered enchiladas - so flavorful and really tasty!  Some of the best I've ever eaten.  After our meal, the chef/owner, Leo Madrigal, stopped by our table and chatted for a moment.  He was gracious and thanked us for coming in. We plan in making this one of our regular dining spots.

As noted by other reviewers, the service here is exceptional, with all of the staff being incredibly helpful and both the manager and owner greeting most, if not all, tables. The drinks menu is excellent, with several great beers on tap, excellent and very strong margaritas, and an large selection of tequila. Food menu is fairly concise, with most of the expected selection of tacos, apps, and enchiladas. There are however a few twists to some dishes, as well as a few surprises in the menu. Was not disappointed in anything we ordered and hope to return soon.",

Was my reply, it is rare when a chef or owner of a restaurant comes by your table. Typically it's a manager but this was so appreciated for him to take his time to ask if I liked the amazing Tacos.

    "text": "Received a notification from yelp about Cocina Madrigal and decided to give it a try and it was well worth the drive! Located in south Phoenix close to south mountain I never expected to find this gem. Authentic and homemade food is being served in a warm and welcoming environment. But don't let the homemade fool you, the menu includes some inventive traditional Mexican dishes with a twist. For example you can add grilled pineapple,bacon, or roasted chile poblanos to your freshly made guacamole. It goes without say that the tortillas are made as your order, coming to you hot & soft. The Mastermind behind this new hot spot is Leo Madrigal. Humble man who comes out from the kitchen to meets its guest and make sure you are fully satisfy. We started our night with the trio appetizer which includes guacamole, queso fundido, and chips & salsa. I also got a blackberry margarita. They do have a limit of 3 margaritas, but trust me that's all you need. They are potent and delicious. For our entree's my boyfriend had the chile verde barbacoa enchiladas which we devoured. I had the trio tacos; 1 shrimp, 1 fish, and 1. Steak. They were all delicious but I loved the perfectly cooked fish and the steak with the gorgonzola cheese was a killer combination! For last we order the churro dessert which comes with a sweet dipping cream and it was just perfection. I am definitely visiting again to try other things in the menu which I'm sure are as delicious as everything last night. I'm sure this place will have lots of success as long as they keep doing things as they are right now. Give them a visit !",

We had the Barbecoa special and the Tacos recommended by our server. The tacos were full and the shrimp inside was grilled to Perfection!!  We also ordered the fresh made Guaca del salsa for an appetizer it came with chips and salsa. We had to order another salsa cuz it was so good!!!!   The manager came to our table sat down and asked what we liked and didn't like. We appreciated his candor. The restaurant was a bit too warm for me but it was okay for my partner. Try it. Well worth it !!",

I had the mushroom enchiladas in ancho mole cream sauce with rice and beans, others had a chicken burrito and the Al Pastor burrito.  Everyone raved about their dishes. My mushroom enchiladas were the best enchiladas I've ever had. Absolutely fantastic. Chips and salsa were excellent as well.   Reasonably priced, friendly service and top flight food. Can't ask for more. Will definitely be back.",

The Chef Lou Madrigal, and son Brian told us they opened 8 months ago.  Lou from Oaxaca .  Has his Mom's and his own recipes   , in this their first restaurant.   To me, A Home Run at first try.    We thought the  very fresh basic ingredients to be a key, even down to the perfect limes..    Appetizers terrific, Oaxaca Fundido had great flavor intensity, with understated chiles.  Chicken, Wild Mushroom, Barbacoa Enchiladas were terrific.   Margaritas to me were topmost quality, made with a higher quality Sauza Reposada Tequila, and fresh made in an ice-cream maker. !!  Unique to me, and the best I  have ever found in Phoenix.  The restaurant was cheery, festive. Thoughtful enthusiastic servers.Was such a wonderful experience we returned tenet night to try more of the menu.  We found every item we had to be exceptional .",

I wish the chicken tacos had grilled meat which I think I would enjoy more and the fish tacos could have a bit bigger piece of fish.  Overall, this will probably become a regular stop for us.",

I had an amazing mushroom enchilada with delicious cheese and a frozen margarita (I know only gringos order frozen.  Don't judge me).  It's a small but attractive place with warm atmosphere.  In the category of dive Mexican Restaurants the clear winner is Presidio but after that are Madrigal, Adrians, Irmas and Cocina Economica but not necessarily in that order.",

    "text": "Honestly I was skeptical about how good of a rating this place had but I wanted to eat some dank Mexican.  I spend a lot of time in Texas and understand higher end Mexican while many other gringos do not.  Looking at the menu online, it didn't seem wildly interesting, but I know that execution is everything.  Unfortunately I was also dining with my idiot coworker who couldn't comprehend why they wouldn't bring him a Chile relleno or why I wanted to spend money on Mexican food.  This spot did not disappoint.  I went in around 1130 pm on a Thursday and the restaurant was mostly empty.  Our server was perfectly attentive and polite about my questions.   The menu is small but well curated.  We started with chips and salsa and Oaxaca fundido, both of which were phenomenal. My dining partner ordered the pastor tacos.  He admitted to loving them.  I had an enchilada plate.  One beef, one barbacoa.  Absolutely wonderful.  Even the rice and beans were interesting and delicious.  My only complaints:  Our table was wobbly, but I'm pretty DIY so I had something in my pocket to fix it.  It was a little on the expensive side, especially the drinks.  Food was reasonable but the draft estrellas were over $5 and the marg was about $9.  It was an absolutely wonderful lunch but 80+ (with tip, we had 3 beers and 1 marg) for lunch seemed a bit excessive.  The only thing I'd change is having lunch drink specials.  Overall, this place is every bit as good as everyone says it is.  Probably the best Mexican I've ever had.  If you're in the area and don't eat here, you need to reassess your priorities.",

After we were sat - the manager / owner came by and recommended the green hatch chile pork to start. The pork itself was so tender and the cheese tangi-ness complimented the sauce & pork perfectly.   We also ordered one of the beef birria & one of the wild mushroom enchiladas (great that i can mix & match enchiladas within one order!) Both were cooked well! The sauce on the mushroom enchiladas was vibrant and so full of flavor! And the beef birria meat spice was well balanced!  We ended our meal with the churros. Sure! - a guilty pleasure, but the caramel dipping sauce complimented the greatly executed deep fried delight so well that we literally spooned away at the rest of the sauce.   Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!",

You can mix and match enchiladas, I ended you getting one chicken and one wild mushroom, they were both really good, lots of flavor! Our server Jose was incredibly nice, explained the menu to us and you could tell he actually cared about his job, Chef Leo also came out to check in on our table as well! Really nice place and I can't wait to go back because I'm wanting to try more items from the menu!",

    "text": "I saw the multitude of five star reviews and had high expectations. Every single one of those expectations was met and more. INCREDIBLE. Be prepared for a long review...   To start, the service was excellent. Eduardo, the manager, was outstanding. He offered recommendations, customizations, his own favorites, and was just incredibly attentive, kind, and funny. Our food, drinks, and appetizers came quick, and they were made with superb quality. I cannot explain how great of vibes there were!   Now for the drinks... oh my goodness! Starting with the blended margaritas, you cannot go wrong. I did half spicy and half sugary mango and then the limoncello and neither disappointed. My sister did the prickly pear, which was just as refreshing and fantastic. Beware: They go down smooth and are stronger than you think!  As for food, everything was honestly incredible. Some of (if not the best?!) Mexican food I've had. The queso fundido was filled with mushrooms, cheese, and sausage creating a unique, filling flavor. The mushrooms especially were fantastic. Pair that with salsa and roasted pineapple guacamole and you have the perfect appetizer trio set!  Now for the entrees, I HIGHLY recommend the beef tenderloin tacos. Easily the best tacos I have EVER had with such a smooth and distinct flavor. The veggie and al pastor were also fantastic. I got the grilled elote (in place of rice and beans), and it served as the perfect side dish. There is a bit of an up charge from the rice and beans, but my goodness, it is worth it!   Words cannot express how authentic and delicious this place is. I am SO happy I stopped in. The perfect way to end my Arizona endeavors (especially because it is a short distance from the Phoenix airport)!  Thank you for an amAZing meal",

While there isn't a labeled or easily identifiable front door, all door are acceptable.  They host was welding and gracious, we were quickly greeted and seated. We arrived about 2pm, but there were lots of businessmen and local there.  Try the mangorita, frozen--- hands down one of the best!  I had the Hatch green vile pork with cheese appetizer and fresh flour tortillas. It was seasoned well, the large chunks of tender meat were in a green Chile sauce and then a white cheese was melted over the top.  I loved this dish, it was still too much for me but they put it in a plastic covered container- Like for deli salads to go.  My husband had the Hatch green Chile enchiladas. The plate came with what he described as the best Mexican rice he'd ever had. He wasn't used to Hatch Chile so he said he wasn't over fond of the enchiladas.",

    "text": "The quality of the ingredients at this place blew me away! Everything was soo fresh, well-cooked, and delicious.  We stopped by for a late lunch. Starved, the four of us devoured the two Steak Burritos, a Steak Quesadilla, a Taco plate consisting of a shrimp, a fish, and a chicken taco, and a Roasted Pork Enchilada!  Like I said earlier, everything was delicious. The Steak Burrito was stuffed to the brim with big chunks of tender steak; we're surprised by how easy it was to finish the gigantic burritos! The Steak Quesadilla has the same steak in it, but was sandwiched between two tortillas and a bunch of cheese instead of being wrapped in one.  The roasted pork in the Enchilada was also super juicy and melt-in-the-mouth tender. The salsa on it was a little fiesty, but I really liked that.  Out of the three tacos, I loved the shrimp taco. It was refreshing with a hint of lime in the avocado sauce and the shrimps were crispy, adding an amazing texture to every bite. The fish taco was good too, although nothing memorable. Meanwhile, the chicken taco was a let-down. It had a weird, mushy texture and a jarring taste...  Overall, I'm still very impressed by the place and its food! It was packed even at ~2pm. The environment was lively and the owner and chef even walked around to greet their customers. I would recommend this place to anyone!",

    "text": "Yes, the five-star rating is Truer than how Kanye needs to see a therapist. This ranks as some of the best Mexican I've ever tasted. Yes -- even when compared both Cali and Texas.  I devoured the following:  *Wild Mushroom Enchiladas ($12.95): Has a mix of three different types of mushrooms, covered in Jack cheese, each rolled in a corn tortilla, and topped with ancho cream, avocado relish, and sour cream. Each bite tasted so fragrant that I couldn't stop myself from inhaling this wonderfulness. (Not sure if I even took a break, too.) Comes with beans and rice.   *Tacos (Varies): I tried three different kinds and would recommend them in the following order (from best to worst):  - Beef Tenderloin Steak: This chipotle pomegranate marinade, fried peppers concoction topped with gorgonzola cheese served as one of the best tacos I've ever tried. The flavors went well together, and they didn't overcook the beef tenderloin (so soft and smooth). I also liked the fresh, soft, tortilla.   - Tropical Fish: Comes with salsa picante, mango, coconut cabbage mix, Oaxaca cheese salsa fresca. Can't go wrong with either the beef or the fish. Each succulent bite made me happy..  - Al Pastor: It didn't taste like the al pastor I'm used to eating. It lacked char and tasted like a porkchop briefly marinated in tomato sauce. I wouldn't recommend it.   *Grilled Elote ($4.95): Pricey for a piece of corn, but the mayo-y, buttery, cheesy awesomeness I had was worth every penny.  *Churros: Comes with two churros sliced in half AND THEY'RE FILLED WITH SOME DELICIOUS CREAM. Comes with a drizzle of caramel, too.   Regarding their service, I thought they sat and served me, quickly. I forget her name, but my server didn't throw an eye roll when I asked her questions.   They have a small patio, bar seating, and tables inside. I wouldn't say it's the biggest place, but it can host big groups. --They have their own lot.  Overall: I def would recommend Cocina Mardigal. DEM TACOS, THO!",

    "text": "I went here with some co-workers for lunch.  This is one of those places that you drive by and at first glance may not want to stop because of the area and you can't really tell it's a restaurant.  My co-worker, who was working in the area and starving after her visit, found it first; saw it on Yelp and took a chance.  She came back to the office and did nothing but rave about the find!  Next...parking is crazy!  The lot is small and they were doing some work outside on the building so a few spots were taken up with construction material and workers but regardless...the lunch hour appears to be popular so parking will be at a premium.  We all parked on the side street and it was fine.  We were seated at a table right by the door, but again, it turned out to be ok.  Chips and salsa are offered for $1.95 but you can get refills.  The basket was big enough to share for five of us.  The salsa was good...a tiny bit of heat but manageable for those who don't like heat (me!).  They also gave a small cup of orange colored salsa, which turned out to be habanero and I was told it was really flavorful and the bite hits you at the end.    A couple of our people had been before and for a few of us (there were five of us) it was a first.  I ordered the Wild Mushroom Enchilada, recommended by previous attendee, and it was fabulous.  I was afraid that the sauce was going to be spicy but it was more flavorful and really not hot.  I did order a side of sour cream (it says it comes with it and it did in the way of a drizzle over the top) to add to the flavors.  What a wonderful dish, which I can't wait to bring my wife back to try.  Chock full of mushrooms and just so yummy!  Came with a side of rice and beans (I'm not a bean person but did take a taste and they were good.  Rice was good as well...a bit different than typical Mexican food rice and much better.    Others had tacos, combination of shrimp and fish (will order these next visit) and all reported how tender and flavorful they were.  One had the vegetable tacos and again, reports were positive and they looked great.  All in all, a great meal and cannot wait to come back.",

The restaurant had a laidback feel to it and fun lively music. The only gripe I have is that we were there at the same time as a very boisterous family that made it hard to hold a conversation even with the people directly next to me.   The service staff was educated and friendly, providing guidance on what were some of the favorites. they provided quick service and made sure we enjoyed our time.   The real star of the place is the food. I had some tacos as per the suggestion of my waiter. The tacos were a little more dressed up then I'm used to, but all for the better. I got a couple of al pastor tacos and a carne asada one. The flavors of the al pastor tacos were on point and elevated by the pickled veggies. The carne asada taco, or beef tenderloin steak, was a stranger in my opinion. I'm not a big fan of the cheese they went with, however, I loved the fried peppers and would order it again without the cheese.   If I ever find myself in Phoenix again ill be sure to come back here.",

But Cocina Madrigal appears to have mastered it. From the moment we arrived, to our departure, we were greeted cheerfully by staff at each level. Even the chef makes rounds at this place.  They take great pride in their food and customized their food to meet our veg requirements. We came searching for mushroom enchiladas and found delight in the Oaxaca Fundido and grilled Romaine Salad. The crisp outside with Bavarian filling of their churro created a noticeable contrast that secured a place in my list of most memorable churros.  And after the meal, we left with a bag of carefully packaged leftovers to enjoy a sunset that echoed the beauty of our evening at the restaurant.",

The absolute, hands down BEST taco was the beef tenderloin.  The beef was succulent, the fried jalapenos were savory, the Gorgonzola took it to the next level. Cocina Madrigal is borderline the best taco I have ever ate.  The mantra of the restaurant is Tacos & Tequila and of you know me, I love me a margarita, on the rocks, frozen, flavored, house.. I do not discriminate  but we were going to a kindergarten curriculum night and I ordered an Ice Tea, next time, it's on! I can't wait to return.",

The chips come out hot and fresh, the salsa is good, guacamole is also good (although would like some heat and a bit more salt), and the queso fundido was amazing with mushrooms.  For entrees, we had a trio of tacos and the chicken pasta. The pasta was good, although could've used a bit more pasta. Nice hints of heat come from the julienned jalapeno. The tacos were delicious. The made to order corn tortillas are great, and flavors of the tacos were all on point. We tried the pastor, fish, and steak - steak was easily my favorite but all were good.  Of course, we ended with the dulce de leche churros. These are done well and not overly sweet.",

Before they sat us they explained the situation, apologized for the inconvenience, but said they would serve us drinks on the house if we wanted to wait.  Quite an offer, so we sat and ordered a Mexican coke (it's a big bottle) and prickly pear margarita on the rocks (delicious).  10 min later they said we could order appetizers so we got the \"Trio\" which comes with Oaxaca fundido, home made guac, and chips with salsa and hot sauce.  All were good, but the Oaxaca fundido was out of this world!  Next, they said we could order an entree if we had cash, as their system was still down.  We split 3 tacos, one fish, one al pastor, and one beef tenderloin.  All were fantastic and it's hard to pick one over another but I was told the tenderloin is their most popular one.    Upon finishing we asked for the check, but after our server spoke with the manager/owner they said it was on the house!  We were pretty insistent on paying as we had cash, but they were adamant.  On the way out the manager/owner apologized again and only asked that we come back again.  Needless to say we plan on making this place a regular spot of ours!",

The price was definitely fair for all that we ordered. I can't wait to go back again! I was so impressed with the Manager not only for his endless energy but how he paid attention to detail. He made it a point to thank us on our way out and then another Manager (I think) held the door open for us. The churros are a MUST no matter how full you are from your meal. They are the best I've ever had and such a precise balance when it came to the sweetness! Oh..I almost forgot the potatoes were to die for!! This place is a hidden gem and worth any amount of driving to get there!!",

Drink refills right when we needed them, super friendly & helpful server & the food is AMAZING!     We got the guacamole to start & it was really good.   We loved the chips & salsa!   I ordered the wild mushroom enchiladas & it was better than I can even try to describe!!  My hubby isn't an enchilada fan and he was surprised how much he loved them!   He got the 3 tacos {you can mix & match}.   We are big al pastor fans but we also love some good steak.   He got 2 al pastor & 1 steak.   Okay.   The steak taco was maybe the best taco we've ever had.   Their tortillas are incredible & fresh!!  Next time we will get 2 steak & try a new flavor.    The beans on the side weren't my favorite but still tasty.   The rice was cooked & seasoned perfectly.    I do wish it was closer to me {it's about 45 minutes away} but it doesn't matter!   It was worth that drive & we will be back soon!!",

The food as fabulous and Chef Leo, his son Brain, and the staff made you feel like you were family.  We stopped in mid-day 3:00 pm.  The food was fresh, homemade, and delicious.    We started off with the guacamole and chips.  The chips were crispy and thin and fresh.  They serve you a large portion.  The salsa was tasty, but the guacamole was exceptional - the avocados favorable and perfect ripeness.   We shared the fish tacos.  The fish was grilled to perfection and perfectly seasoned. I was happy that they give you the option of having the taco wrapped in lettuce for people who are eating healthy.  My boyfriend liked the corn tortillas too.  The taco had just the right of of filling including some mangoes and filling. The flavors blended well.    The best part of the delicious meal was the churro dessert!  OMG!  The best I've ever  eaten in my life and filled with cream. My boyfriend and I shared this perfectly prepared, cinnamon and sugar balanced, crunchy and creamy dessert.  Next time I'm not sharing!  Lol! . Just kidding.   The staff was friendly and the service was fast!  We highly recommend this place. It is locally owned and worth the price.  Treat yourself to a nice meal and cocktail but save room for the churros!  Thank you chef Leo and Brian and staff.",

It's so unassuming, which is why I loved that everything from the server/manager, to the drinks, appetizers and meal were so amazingly delicious!  The chef came out twice to see how we liked our food, he was so gracious.  The manager was our server and treated us like friends from the moment we walked in the door.  Everything was amazing at this place, you have to check it out!",

I had a spicy margarita, beef tenderloin steak tacos, grilled elotes, and churros! I CLEANED the plates by myself...it was that good.

    "text": "We came here on a whim after telling ourselves we needed to try a new place once a month and of course we were craving Mexican food.   We ordered the chips and salsa (1.95), a cup of chicken tortilla soup 3.95), wild mushroom enchiladas (12.95), the macho mucho (10.95),the churros (5.95) ,House margarita (8.95) and a frozen strawberry margarita (9.95); Bill was $60 without tip.  The location is on the side of 16st ave, near many commercial buildings, and we opted for the outdoor patio because we don't get many nice times to sit outside in Arizona. The only complaint about being outside is you're literally right next to 16st, only a sidewalk separates you and cars were flying down the street- like 60mph as you dine right next to the street.   The food was so great and so were the margaritas. It was a little expensive, the margaritas weren't huge (think of a margarita in a 3/4 full wine glass)- but the price tag of $10 for a frozen margarita seemed a little steep. Also why do we have to pay for chips and salsa, it's a Mexican restaurant- we ordered entrees, drinks and dessert, complimentary chips and salsa would be nice. The enchilada was very cheese, but super tasty i enjoyed all the mixes of mushrooms, and my boyfriend enjoyed the flavor of his burrito. They marinate the chicken all day, both entrees came with black beans and rice. The churros were fantastic. We didn't realized they were stuffed churros, but it was a pleasant surprise. It's two churros that are cut diagonally, stuffed with some cream cheese consistency blend and then has caramel drizzle. They were warm and tasted as if they were just made.   We were pleased that the owner or chef (he was wearing a black uniform), came around to the patio asking how everything was. We thought that was a nice touch!",

With outstanding service, a chef and a lovely bartender who explain and really believe in their food, you could get lost in one bite. The amount of care shown with each dish is palpable, a subtle flavor, a gentle hint of special hidden behind a veneer of traditional. Comfortable, mixed with a kick in the pants of outstanding. To say this is hands down the best Mexican food I have ever had would be telling the truth. To say this will be the best you have ever had, is an easy prediction. Many thanks to the staff for making us feel your passion for the food.  To the lovely couple who payed for our dessert without us knowing, we will be back, and hope to pay for yours next time.

This was almost a meal and SUPER delicious...every single item!  Word of caution: there were the most amazing Hatch Green Chili's hiding in the queso.  I ate one and the right side of my face went numb, my eyes were filled with tears and my mucus membranes were running like the Boston marathon!  The worst was the next morning...but I digress.  Our entree was Hatch Green Chile Pork Enchiladas and like the Tres Amigos...this did not disappoint!  Soft, deliciously seasoned pulled pork, wrapped in a soft corn tortilla and topped with green Chile sauce.  Both of us mopped our plate clean!  Desert had to be done so we grabbed some Churros.

Great service too ... our bartender/server was awesome: efficient and friendly.   Darn we missed happy hour ... but that's okay the margarita was bomb anyway!  The trio I can't say enough about those three amazing of stages of goodness. Watch out for that spice too, lots of zing.   The barbacoa pork enchiladas were the best though. Great sauce, tender meat, and even an egg on top! The rice had a fresh taste and consistency and I super appreciated the whole pinto beans (minus all the lard).  Haven't found a Mexican food place in Phx I liked better! Great experience all around!!  Ps ... they split plates like pros",

We were greeted immediately as we walked in and seated right away. It's a pretty small restaurant with a good vibe and great, friendly service. Our server, Jenny, was really sweet and gave us great recommendations for food and drinks!  We ordered the bacon jalapeno guacamole (they have various flavors of guacamole to choose from). It was very fresh and delicious with the spicy salsa and warm chips. We also ordered the tacos (you pick 3 tacos with a side of rice and beans); we got a fish taco, el pastor taco and steak taco. They were all delicious, fresh and full of meat/toppings but the steak was hands down the best! The steak is so tender and flavorful and the fried onions and peppers on top are the perfect crunch. It was melt in your mouth, moan while you eat it good.   We also ordered the churros for dessert after we saw every single table in the restaurant with them, we couldn't resist! They are unlike any other churro. They are filled with custard and drizzled in caramel. I highly recommend them!   We'll be back for the steak tacos for sure!",

    "text": "After reading a Review of the Day on Cocina Madrigal, I had to give it a try! My family and I absolutely loved it! The waitress recommended the grilled pineapple guacamole, it was delicious! Next time I'm going to ask if they can make it spicy, but it's really good the way it comes too! (I just like spicy guacamole!.) we did ask for some lime wedges, and after a few squeezes and some additional salt, that seemed to bring it to life, and really help accent the grilled pineapple!  You'll also need to order chips and salsa, theses do not come complimentary to your table. However, I'm a chip and salsa girl, and the chips are thin and crispy with the right amount of salt, and the salsa is AMAZING!! Spicy and flavorful! Do order both these appetizers!   We all got house margaritas, they were perfectly balanced,and delightful! Love a good margarita!   We ordered the grilled Elote' it was fully dressed with all the goodies that grilled street corn should have! They offer it on the cob, and off!, we tried both ways! Both equally good, just a personal preference how you like to eat it.   For our entrees, our party ordered; chicken pasta, chicken enchiladas, steak burrito, and wild mushroom enchilada and a beef enchilada! If you remotely \"like\" mushrooms, this is a must! It was so tasty! All the entrees were flavorful and above average, the beans and rice, was some of the best I've had! I usually treat these two items as a garnish, and never touch it, but not here! The rice and beans are definitely house made, and so darn good! We all enjoyed everything!   Service was also above average, we were constantly checked on, taking more drink orders, or filling up our water, nothing got left unnoticed, even though this place was packed! (They do take reservations, so take advantage of that!) because this place is hopping!   I will be back!!! Probably too much, this place is legit!",

    "text": "The destination can be daunting. It is South Phoenix, after all.  We came because I had friends hyping this place almost every day. I had to see what the big deal was.  We were seated by Raudel at a table in the center of the action.  Their menu is small, but still has a good selection of dishes. We came with big appetites and they were steering our eyes and our mouths when we made our orders.  As such, we had to take home most of our dinner!  We started out with the homemade guacamole, the fundido, and their chips and salsa. The chips are crisp and well textured. They make them from scratch in the restaurant. The salsa has a nice bite, but it's not too fiery. We liked it a lot, but I'm partial to the salsa at La Pinata.  I don't have enough raves for the guacamole. I don't even like guacamole, but I scooped this up greedily. I believe they might have put something addictive into the mixture. My favorite from the appetizers had to be the Fundido. It's generous enough to be a meal.  It has smokey bits of sausages in a spicy chili sauce with enough cheese to daunt anyone with even the slightest hint of lactose intolerance.   The main dishes were outstanding. The steak in the burro was marinated and although tender tasted as though it had been grilled slightly. The marinade had a tangy bit of flavor to it. It really was enjoyable, as were the beans and rice. I don't normally like having a side of beans, but this restaurant does them correctly. The enchiladas were also a hit with me.  The only disappointment is that they don't serve flan. What! No Flan?!   The highlight of the evening was having Chef Leo come out and talk to me. He shook both our hands  and spent a long time talking to us. He chatted about his background. He grew his love for cooking by watching his grandmother. He grew his experience through his various to travels which included Mexico City and Houston. A couple years ago he started this restaurant and he felt very blessed that it was so well received.   One thing that hurt him, however, was a diner called him a clown to his face because he didn't serve a carnitas burro. He felt bad that someone   would be so unkind simply because of a lack of a menu item.   I, on the other hand, think Chef Leo is a genius and we'll be back. He told me that he will put flan on the menu since so many have asked for it and to make sure to call him in advance to see if it's available.",

    "text": "4.5/5  Cocina Madrigal is cocina magical! This restaurant isn't in the most scenic nor magical part of town but the flavors and service here make up for the lack of neighborhood ambiance.  Reservations were easy to make on Yelp and we were seated right away when we got here. It was a bit too warm for me initially in the restaurant but I got used to it after a while.   The cuisine here is probably best described as Nuevo Latino, with unique twists on some Mexican food classics. The menu offers tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and various entree platters.   We started off with an incredible guacamole with salsa and chips. Usually when I have guacamole at a restaurant that touts itself as being made fresh to order at your table it's good, but nothing so special that I couldn't make it at home, but this guac had a nuanced depth of flavor that I absolutely loved. Whatever that special ingredient is, keep it coming it's so spectacular! It was served with a mountain of chips with a bowl of salsa. This was a good sized amount of guacamole too by the way, so well worth your money.  I was intrigued by the grilled romaine salad so I opted for that as my main dish with steak tenderloin. This was my first time having a grilled romaine salad and it won't be my last! I loved that grilled mesquite flavor permeating through the lettuce and it was cooked just enough that the lettuce still retained its crispness. The steak was very tender, well seasoned, and an ample portion.   I had a bite of the churros for dessert, and it was a fabulously heavenly bite! They were nice and warm with a custard center and the dipping sauce was amazing.   What also really sets this restaurant apart is the superb service. Drinks were refilled constantly, our server was excellent and the chef came by our table to make sure everything was OK. I really appreciate all the care that he places to make sure the diners at his restaurant are having the best experience possible.",

I arrived a little before 6pm to try to get some of the Happy Hour deals, only to learn happy hour ended at 6 and I had like 5 minutes to place my order, so I quickly ordered a house margarita and some chips and salsa!   The chips are homemade and so fresh and there are 2 salsas, a mild flavorful one and a habanero salsa, it was smoky & hot and soo good! Could not stop eating it!  After checking out the menu I went with the beef tenderloin steak tacos. It was three tacos on homemade corn tortillas with chipotle pomegranate marinated steak, fried peppers, Gorgonzola cheese on house made corn tortillas served with rice and beans. These are what taco dreams are made of!   A friend ordered the churro dessert and let me tell you, it was sweet bliss!  Even got to meet Chef Leo Madrigal, what a treat!   Cocina Madrigal was everything I hoped it to be and more! Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Overall, the food was above average (apart from the wild mushroom enchiladas - I'd come back for those). It was more like Mexican food with an American twist. Everyone was extremely friendly, and that personality definitely sets Cocina apart from other typical Mexican restaurants.  We ordered the guacamole with roasted pineapple, frozen prickly pear margarita ($10), wild mushroom enchiladas, and the taco trio (2 beef tenderloin, 1 fish).  Starters - The guac was okay, but unless you can't have a single meal without guac, I think the salsa sufficed. Margarita was delicious, but on the smaller side, a liiiiittle too small for $10 (sorry!).  The mushroom enchiladas were definitely worth the try. I was dubious because I thought \"psh how good can mushrooms be\". The enchiladas were covered in a creamy, tomatoey, sauce (reminded me of vodka sauce) and before that first bite of enchilada touches your tongue, you'll taste it because the strong aroma of the mushrooms emanates off your fork - such a fantastic flavor. Rice and beans were alright.  Beef tenderloin steak tacos were also great - the gorgonzola was weird at first, but I got used to it; fried peppers on top were a good addition. The fish taco was just okay - not sure what fish it was, but it was a tad dry and lacked seasoning.",

We enjoyed the trio appetizer, Madrigal burger, beef enchiladas, chicken burrito, the al pastor tacos, a few margaritas and the must order churros to share to finish our meal. Everything was  made fresh and came out piping hot.   Excellent service. The owner/manager came to our table to greet us and thank us for coming in shortly after we arrived. Our waitress was friendly and expedited the food when she knew we had a plane to catch. Fairly busy on a Sunday night but still no wait to be seated or served.   Great meal to end our adventure in the Scottsdale area. We would definitely recommend this place and would come back if in the area again.",

It was also nice having the chef stop by the table to ask how everything was. I can't wait to go back and get some more.",

The beef and chicken were a bit disappointing though. The beef was watery and the green sauce on the chicken didn't have much flavor at all!

The main courses were to die for and the guac appetizer was so fresh, we ended up eating it with our forks! I loved the bloody marry, but we are obsessed with the he lemon cello marg! Highly recommend this place. The mushroom enchiladas were excellent and of the three tacos I got I loved the beef and blue cheese taco! Also, best churro I've ever had.",

    "text": "WOW! I now understand the hype behind this place. My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday night from Scottsdale. Luckily, we made a reservation through yelp because it was extremely busy!  It's rather unassuming from the outside and a little hard to park. But it was SO WORTH IT.   We wanted to sit near a tv to watch nba conference finals and they were happy to accommodate us! Once we were seated our server came over and we ordered guacamole, which you must do. If you come in here you MUST get it, best I've had outside Mexico (maybe even ever).  I don't care even if you \"don't like guacamole\" this will change your mind I promise.   They bring you chips and salsa by default and those are amazing too. The chips are light but don't break on a big scoop of guac. The salsa had some heat but was very bearable and tasty.   I ordered the steak burrito and my boyfriend got the tenderloin tacos. Both were out of this world. My burrito had so much steak and great ratio of fillings. The only thing I would change next time is not get lettuce inside. It wilts inside the warm burrito and I really have a dislike for wilted lettuce.   The tacos are unreal. I see why they are so popular. The textures the flavors and the substantial meat proportion is great.   The owner came by as we were finishing up and watching the game. He thanked us for coming in, asked how we liked our food, etc. After chatting with him a bit he told us all about the margs and how we need to try them. So we did!  The blended margaritas are SO GOOD. Not too syrupy or sweet and not too icy and not skimping on the tequila!   I would love to come back and would suggest it to anyone.",

We ordered chicken tacos and seasonal vegetables tacos (tacos comes with side of rice and beans). The vegetarian tacos had roasted vegetables with no spice or flavor, I can understand the blandness (as you can always add the hot sauce) but the lack of flavor was very disappointing. Now the chicken tacos, it's supposed to be flavored with achiote(a spice) but there is no sign of any spice. The cost of the food, not really sure why it's so high. Very disappointed as we were hoping to find a good Mexican place in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "What can I say? Another wonderful experience from Chef Madrigal and his staff.   After plans for my birthday had to be rescheduled at the last minute, my family and I decided to return for another long-awaited visit to Cocina Madrigal. It was an extraordinarily busy Tuesday night, with two very large parties seated on the patio and in the front room, but we were quickly seated and attended to.   I had been looking forward to trying their guacamole and we ordered one right away, along with the queso fundido and chips and salsa. The guac was fresh and very flavorful with the addition of jalapenos and onions. Their salsa is some of the best in the valley. Queso fundido with sausage was a favorite of the table, containing sausage, fresh melty cheddar cheeses (none of the processed nacho cheese you normally see on menus) as well as marinated mushrooms and caramelized onion.   The one mis-step of the evening was that our drink order was mixed up at the bar (this seems to be their one area for improvement as it also happened during our first visit) but it was quickly remedied and the cocktails were strong and tasty.   For my entree I was torn between revisiting the excellent mushroom enchiladas of my first enjoyable visit, and trying something new. At the server's recommendation I opted to try the stuffed chicken and artichoke stack with mashed potatoes and fresh steamed veggies. The chicken was smoky and moist and the potatoes were fine but the standout was actually the side of veg. They were cooked in loads of butter and were mouth-wateringly good.   My family enjoyed the tenderloin tacos and birria enchilada plate they ordered. We were also told the corn tortillas are made-to-order. (I'll make sure to get some to go next time.) For the finishing touch, Chef came out to check on us and a large slice of coconut cream pie was delivered to our table on the house with a candle for me. (My request preempted their complimentary birthday churros.)   We took home plenty of leftovers because our stomachs could not handle the portions after indulging in too much guacamole and queso. I also ordered a pint of their fresh salsa to go which I will enjoy having with chips today.   I can't let the review go by without props to our server, who was attentive to our (many) requests and good natured without being obtrusive. The service was quick and we didn't even notice they were also taking care of two large parties at the same time as us, despite the jovial celebration that was going on in the next room. The service didn't suffer at all due to their busyness.   This has become our favorite local stop and we can't wait to bring put of town guests to show them what great service and dining South Phoenix has to offer!",

We had the beef and chicken enchiladas. When I asked the server about the heat for the green sauce, she thoughtfully suggested I take it on the side - just in case. It was just fine and I bathed the enchiladas with it!  No room for dessert and too early for margaritas that day. Glad we have an excuse to come.back again soon.",

The menu is familiar, but with vital additions/changes and refined flavors. The elotes were a great start. The mushroom enchiladas were a draw since one of our crowd is a vegetarian. They turned out to be one of the highlights, with a terrific ancho mole. The restaurant is off the beaten path, south of downtown in a warehouse district. The dining room is pleasant, and the outdoor patio looked nice, too, with good shading. Service was great.",

But with this salsa I was extremely satisfied it kept you wanting more. Tried the taco trio ;veggie, al pastor and shrimp taco, It came with a side of rice and whole beans. This is a fairly new restaurant and there was not many customers which was nice since we were able to talk with the owner and his son, they were very nice ,friendly and open to feedback. Thank you for making us feel welcomed. I would go back to give some other dishes a try and definitely going back for more spicy salsa!",

We went last week looking to find great Mexican food; there are so many 24 hour drive through Mexican food places in the area but they all start to sound the same i.e. \"Filibertos\", \"Lilibertos\", \"Fredericos\". Their menus are standard fare. Cocina Madrigal has excellent guacamole, fresh ingredients, and a menu that while not huge, has something for everyone. I was surprised to see jerk chicken and Mac and cheese on the menu! I'm coming back soon. I'm getting the guacamole. I'm getting a margarita. And yeah, I'll try the burger next time.",

    "text": "This is definitely one of my favorite places in town to eat. I've been there twice now, both for lunch and I've been happy each time. It's an unassuming little place, on 16th st north of Broadway. Super clean and cute.  You'd never expect to find what you find on the inside, but what you find is incredible. First time there, i tried an enchilada plate with one barbacoa green chili and one wild mushroom. Omg it was a flavor explosion in my mouth!  Truly incredible!  Today i encouraged more of my coworkers to join me, and we all raved throughout the meal. We started with the trio with salsa, guacamole, and queso fundido. The salsa had a perfect amount of spice, the guacamole was perfect with no element overwhelming another, and the queso was different, but delicious! If you don't like mushrooms, don't eat it and save it for the rest of us!  Most of us ordered various versions of the taco plate, another a salad, and another an enchilada plate. The beef tenderloin tacos...AMAZING!  But the al pastor and shrimp weren't far behind. Everything was beautiful and perfect and we are all excited to head back another day. One of these days, we will splurge on that churro dessert.",

My husband and I went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The outside may seem suspect but you quickly realize that this family-owned restaurant is cozy, inviting with a dynamic menu. The place was full of folks enjoying themselves. We even saw police officers eating and you know if they are there then it's tasty . The house margarita was smooth. My husband had the steak taco with blue cheese, jalapeno crunchies and he swore it was the best taco he has ever eaten. The corn tortillas are freshly made and the pork appetizer was fantastic. I had the chicken enchiladas which were so good. We got the churros to go to bring home to our kids but only 1 1/2 made it to the house. I highly recommend this restaurant and give kudos to the Chef who introduced himself to us!!! Can't wait to go back.",

If you are ever in Phoenix and want a True from scratch meal....is is he place!!!  We shared the caramelized pineapple guacamole.  Which was probably the best guacamole I've had.  Anne had the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas with a Oaxaca Mole (no chocolate in the mole). I had two steak tacos and one fish.   The fish was my favorite out of my dish but the winner tonight was the wild mushroom enchilada.  The intense flavor of the mole and the sauteed mushroom made you feel like you weren't eating a vegetarian dish.  The beans and rice did not disappoint either.  It is good we don't live here because we would be poor if we were here.  This is a True Mexican restaurant that will be consistent with every bite!",

Even pictures or something on the walls (which, I think, were bare) would absorb some of the loudness - not that I like talking a lot while having a meal (things get cold) but it would have been nice to hear the people across the table from me.  Otherwise that was the best Mexican food I've had in a long, long time.  I also had to explain what a Silver Coin cocktail was, which is very similar to a margarita, but maybe others will pick up the order now and make it as popular here as it is in Santa Fe.  I loved the spiciness of the food - it was just right and not 'watered down' for the typically cowardly American palate.  Good job Cocina Madrigal!",

If I ever return to Phoenix,  I will go here again.  I have had Michelin rated Mexican food in the SF Bay Area - Cocina Madrigal is as good.  Fresh flavorful salsas.  Fresh Passionfruit Tea that is unsweetened.  Really a memorable meal.  The server was perfect too and happy to explain items on the menu and offered us samples to try items that we were unfamiliar with.  Clearly he enjoys the cuisine and described it well.",

We started with the chips and salsa which was very fresh and the chips were crisp and thin. We followed that up with the barbacoa enchiladas which were all meat and had a delicious sauce on top.

The Chicken Tortilla Soup also is a little different in its texture but has a great flavor.  They also make their own corn tortillas and everything on the menu is made from scratch.  This is definitely a good mine for food!",

The table next to us was contemplating also returning for another meal. The food was as if I had a Mexican dad and he cooked with love, everything was amazing. Although we were about to burst, Leo offered us the churros and I can say, coming from Miami where we are no strangers to them, that they were the best churros I've had in my life. Anyways this is now a must-do when I'm in Phoenix. Thanks Leo and staff!",

Great tortilla soup, enchiladas, street tacos and a spicy fire chicken pasta. We all loved the minimalist (not touristy) feel of the restaurant in an old house. Covered outdoor seating is available. The house Margaritas were also well made. I did not eat it, but the chocolate pie was apparently to die for. We liked Madrigal so much we went a second timeout the last night of our trip. They are still working through minor service issue as they are dealing with their newfound popularity. I would definitely call for a reservation even if you are going mid-week. They were packed on the Monday and Thursday that we went. Eduardo and the rest of the staff and made us feel very welcome.",

I'm not a coconut fan, but I tried their coconut pie because of other reviews and it's incredible as well.  As I said, if you love good, spicy Mexican then try this place, but don't tell anyone else cuz we'll be calling in for reservations too soon in the future!!",

    "text": "Checked this place out after seeing some rave reviews on the Nextdoor app.  A little back story - my kids and I just loved to SoPhx from Chandler a few months ago. We always lived in the East valley and it has been so much fun checking out local flavors...and Cocina Madrigal did NOT disappoint.  My son and I visited Cocina Madrigal the other day. We actually missed it because the signage isn't great, but we were able to quickly get back on path. Small parking lot, so be aware of that if you go during happy hour/dinner. Also, it gets a little hard to hear across the table as the dining room fills up.  We entered through an unmarked door near the patio & saw a hostess stand between the dining room and the bar area. The hostess was friendly & we were seated immediately. Our server, Zay, was helpful and energetic.  We started with chips and salsa. The salsa was a little more heat than I can usually take, but I powered through because it was delicious!  For our entrees...He had the tacos (Al Pastor, Anchiote Braised Chicken & Beef Tenderloin Steak) and I had the Barbacoa Green Chile Enchiladas + a house margarita (rocks, no salt).  My son doesn't usually try new things and was questioning the pickled red onions on the Al Pastor taco, but he went for it and had nothing but good things to say!  The enchiladas were so tasty, but I was full from the chips &  salsa. Ended up taking some home...of course, my son ate the leftovers the next day  The margarita was excellent as well - glad I gave it a try!   Will definitely be back to try more things on the menu.",

The guacamole was fresh and chunky, the salsa was just the right amount of spicy, and the queso was an interesting mix of chorizo and peppers. The queso wasn't my favorite though, but I'm glad I tried it. What was my favorite were the steak tenderloin tacos... OMG. There was some sort of a sauce on them that was out of this world, plus crispy onions (the kind your mama puts on green bean casserole, but fresh), and peppers/cheese. Omg. I miss those tacos already. Also, we met the owner, Leo, and he said this was his lifelong dream, so I must obviously continue to support him by buying his delicious tacos once a week.",

To get right to the point, we were not impressed and have had better Mexican food at other nearby restaurants. One thing they did well was with the guacamole which was made fresh and was truly delicious. Pricing for the guacamole was a little high but it's fresh so we understood. My wife and I had the enchiladas and weren't impressed.. the meat portions were skimpy and the meal lacked flavor overall. The margaritas had close to no alcohol in them and after 3 drinks each hardly felt a buzz. Great guacamole, not impressed with the meal itself or the drinks.",

My beans came with a dead fly in them and even though we told them about it they didn't offer a discount or anything but a simple apology. Then, I cut into my burrito and this big leaf popped out with big black beans. It was the weirdest looking Mexican food I ever saw or tasted. After all that, they didn't even bring us hot sauce; we had to ask for it and the hot sauce was weird too. We were very disappointed and will never go back.",

I explained to him I'd just driven down from LA and was too exhausted to go all the way to the car I didn't even care to drink but my fiance wanted to sit at the bar. In LA it's not a big deal. So my fiance went to get my iD and we ordered food, dessert, and drinks and then I was projectile vomiting all night. It must have been E. coli from bad food handling because I haven't had this type of stomach pain since I was a kid and ate at a food truck. I am very disappointed with my experience since this is ranked one of the top places in the US. The bartender was lovely but the manager customer service skills were awful.",

    "text": "Last night we finally tried Cocina Madrigal. It had been on the list of 'must try's' since opening. Five stars HANDS DOWN! It's a cute little place in the not the cutest of neighborhood's. We were greeted and sat almost immediately. Everyone here was smiling; I notice these types of things right away and I liked that cheerful vibe. The menu is simple but with more than just tacos and burritos. There were also some specialty items too like pastas and steak. We started with drinks. Our waitress didn't present us with a drink menu rather she verbalized the different margaritas and they have Four Peaks beer too. I got the Sangrita , a sangria swirled frozen margarita and it was refreshing and perfect... also. Strong without your 'knowing' it until you possibly order another and it 'hits you'! For an app , we got the trio of Chips/Salsa; Queso Fundido ; and Guacamole. I LOVED this salsa! It was fresh and the way I love salsa .. Not too overwhelming with heat but good! The queso was served in a sizzling skillet with hot peppers and didn't end up all thick in a few minutes like some queso's. Guacamole was good but loaded with peppers! My main was the Wild Mushroom Enchilada with Ancho Chile Cream ; Avocado Relish and Sour Cream. I loved this flavor combo which had a taste of mole without being overwhelming 'too mole' for the rest of the flavors in the dish. This dish was a good portion sized of enchiladas and I brought one home. It was served with beans and rice. My daughter had the Chicken Green Chile Enchiladas and it had a kick of heat! It was loaded with chicken and very good. At dessert we decided to share the Churros that were warm and filled with a cream served with a swirl of caramel and bowl of more vanilla cream! Best churros out of Madrid ! I ordered the Coconut Pie and it was very rich and good! I saved it for coffee the next morning! The manager was walking around the entire night delivering drinks and talking to guests and the chef was also! The waitress we had was also very happy and engaging; the service was great! I am a fan of all things Mexican; Southwest or Spanish! I am ESPECIALLY a fan of all those things when they are local and amazing .. Cocina Madrigal is all those things wrapped in a cool little building in what some may call 'the hood of South Phoenix'; Well. Great things are sometimes born out of places one would not expect and this is very likely..  one of them!",

Showed up at 9:25 pm (feeling lame to show so close to closing time) and it was pretty full still even though they closed at 10 pm. While the ambiance is nothing to write home about (Leo needs my decorating expertise lol) and baby blue paint with bare walls, the food was OUTSTANDING! Best Mexican food I've had while living in the valley in over 38 years and the hubby agrees! Everything we tried was hot, fresh and flavorful. Their Oaxaca grilled shrimp taco (lettuce wrapped) made your mouth water, and the melt in your mouth beef tenderloin tacos with chipotle pomegranate marinade was to die for! Homemade everything. Their tortilla chips are fresh made, thin as can be and hot and tasty. Our server was fast, friendly and knowledgable of every dish on the menu. He recommended the Barbacoa beef enchiladas, mix and match tacos and Oaxaca Fundido and Guacamole de Casa appetizers. SO GOOD! Guacamole is exceptional! Salsa has just the right kick. Even better, Leo, the chef/owner, personally came over to our table to welcome us and thank us for coming. I have to agree with him. South Phoenix neighbors are the friendliest people in the valley, and I've lived in the east, north, west and now south. We plan on being regulars here. Nowhere better, and next time I'll be sure to post pictures!",

He served us excellent food with the freshest ingredients- even the tortillas are freshly made to order. This guy would impress Gordon Ramsay with his simple menu, great staff, clean and comfortable dining room, and delicious food. We ordered the mushroom enchiladas and beef enchiladas and some house guacamole. I would've taken pictures of it but we devoured it all too quickly! Erin, our server was excited to share her favorites on the menu and she was really friendly and gracious with us. Chef Madrigal personally delivered our guacamole to us and checked in to make sure everything was going well. Plus he told us a little about himself and that was really cool. I love this community and that Chef Madrigal is part of it! Definitely coming back here again! I came for the guacamole and I'll stay for all the rest being so amazing! Thanks guys!!

Our 9 dollar margaritas arrived just fine, but i had to go to the bar and request the water. That set me off the wrong way. Then a couple of girls at the bar left, and came back. We had no idea, we just know that we  got to look at what appeared to be dirty dishes, not picked up. That looked terrible. Also, i could see  the cleaning supplies behind the hostess stand. Might be a good place for a little curtain. Not appetizing. Just details with service that need to be worked out. The food however!  The food is terrific. I had the chicken enchiladas, my husband had something beef. Very interesting, spicy and the rice and beans sides were just as good, not a boring sidenote. We were quite pleased.

The chef came out and offered us his homemade habenero hotsauce which was also bangin. He then proceeded to check on us regularly and actually walked outside as we were getting in our car to make sure everything was enjoyable. Love this place!",

We started with $6 happy hour margaritas and the trio appetizer which was their homeade tortilla chips and salsa and made to order guac and queso (happy hour is $2 off appetizers and the $6 margs until 6pm). Definitely do the trio app and margs. I had the taco platter that comes with 3 tacos and you can mix and match them. I chose 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp and did 2 on their homeade corn tortillas and 1 on a lettuce cup and it comes with beans and rice. My parents had the beef tenderloin steak tacos which were my favorite, then the shrimp were our 2nd favorite and then the fish. They were all fantastic and fresh though. We also had a wild mushroom enchilada which is their most popular item and the best enchilada we have ever had and a beef enchilada. Great service and the food came out fast and fresh. We might have to stop here on our way back to the airport in a few days  It's off a busier road but they have a big parking lot and a sign out front with their name.",

Turned to trusty Yelp and found a highly rated Mexican restaurant less than two miles from the airport. We approached with some trepidation.  The building is unassuming in an industrial area. Not much activity at 3:30 on a Thursday afternoon. We were pondering our options when Eduardo, the GM, invited us in and said he would take care of us - and did he ever! We started with the trio appetizer. Freshly made guacamole, chips and salsa and the to die for mushroom fondue served with fresh hand made tortillas. Everything was so good we decided to share our entrees. Beef tenderloin tacos with fried onion, peppers and Gorgonzola, three mushroom enchiladas and Barbacoa enchiladas. A couple of ice cold margaritas and a spicy nut chocolate pie rounded out the meal. We were enchanted to meet Chef Leo who curated the menu and the service was on point. We talked about our experience all weekend and had to leave Sedona early so our friend could taste for herself. We were not disappointed!  Finished the meal with the most delectable churros. I am not one to photograph my food, but here you go!  Do yourself a favor if you are ever remotely near the Phoenix airport - give this place a try. Tell Eduardo and Leo the ladies from San Francisco say hi!",

Found this place on Yelp, and was very happy to find that the reviews are spot-on. I got three different types of tacos, Beef Tenderloin Steak, Al Pastor, and Achiote Braised Chicken. All three were delicious, but next time I'm getting all three Beef Tenderloin Steak. It was out of sight! The beef was tender and seasoned just right, not too salty or dry. There were carmelized onions on it that I was not expecting, but totally fit right in with the personality of the taco. I chose flour tortillas, but next time I'll probably get corn. The waitress recommended them because they make them fresh there, but I foolishly went with flour. And regretted it as I watched other tacos come out with the corn. Service was excellent. Everyone was attentive and I must have had 4 different people approach me to ask how I was enjoying my meal. Will definitely be back!",

We arrived just after opening and were welcomed at the door.  The very personable team here is exceptional.  Our server, Nallely, graciously transitioned our original \"guacamole only\" order to the Trio.  Don't miss this trio! Fundido and guacamole and both salsas (we especially liked the hotter salsa) are fantastic.  Chips and corn tortillas part of the deal.  Then came the entrees.  My wife had the Grilled Romaine and I had the steak tacos.  We were left with mouthfuls of flavor!  We had always been fans of the past Z Tejas menu and it seems like Chef gets to do everything here corporate probably wouldn't allow at the larger company.  We remarked to Nallely that it looked like someone was having fun in the kitchen!      Impeccable and unobtrusive service coupled with such a warm welcome from the first hello makes you feel right at home.   We already reached out to our lunch buddies to join us next time.

Coming from NYC which has some amazing restaurants and also having traveled across the globe has made us rather experimental... esp. in our pursuit of culture and food, so yes we admittedly crave authentic food and amazing experiences. Moving to Phoenix we quickly discovered the valleys many restaurants serving amazing Mexican cuisine and since then have been on a search for the best tacos. Being a pescatarian we have always had a hard time to find alternates that match the quality, enthusiasm, perfect balance of protein and flavors in something that are not carne asada. Till date La Santisima was hands down our go to place for its salsa bar and Mexican food. Looks like today we have found another gem to add to our growing list of favorite restaurants.  I am glad today we felt like trying something new and hence skipped our planned trip to barrios cafe and ventured south to this wonderful lil gem that opened few months back. We tried a combination of different tacos one of each fish, shrimp, braised chicken and veggi taco. Along with our serves recommendation of mushroom enchiladas with mole sauce. I don't think the mole sauce was authentic or similar to what I have had before none the less it was still amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The star of the evening though were the prickly pear margarita and the shrimp tacos. The shrimp taco was perfectly done and had generous amount of shrimp. No fillers there. We thought may be it was a fluke that someone got the shrimp cooked so perfectly hence we ordered another helping. But it was still bang on ... I think out of all the tacos we had that was our favorite ... we will be coming back just for this. Keep up the amazing work !",

Our food was incredible and the service was simply amazing.  Leo, the chef came out to greet us twice. He was so kind and it made the whole experience special.

For our meals we both ordered the chicken enchiladas; which were excellent.     When we finished our meal the chef walked over to our table and told us that he hoped we enjoyed our meal.  What a special touch that you do not see that much anymore.  I will be going back to this summer notice Mexican restaurant.

    "text": "After hearing good things recently, we decided to check Cocina Madrigal out on Tuesday night.  Moderately busy, we were seated immediately by a polite and friendly hostess.  I had their house marg / rocks / salt and it was well made and refreshing, not overly sweet.   Clearly from fresh ingredients.     Next we ordered the Trio - Oaxaca Fundido, house guacamole, salsa and chips.  All were ample and delicious.  The Fundido was my favorite, nice level of spice, very tasty.  The guac is not simply mashed up avocado - it has lots of goodies mixed into it and was a huge portion to dip chips in.  Their house salsa is amazing.  Really good flavor on the mild-medium heat level.  Tried the habanero salsa as well and it wasn't as hot as I expected (which is a good thing) but was also bursting with flavor.     I then had the barbacoa enchiladas with rice & beans.   Simply amazing, huge flavor, very satisfying.     Then we moved on to the coconut pie and churros for dessert.  I am not a coconut fan but actually liked this stuff.   The churros had some sort of cheese or custard filling in them that was a little savory, and dipping them in the provided sweet vanilla caramel sauce blew me away. They were so good!    Finally, the service was fantastic.   Waters were kept full, other drinks and food were brought out expediently, and every employee we interacted with was friendly.    We will 100% definitely go back.  Very happy to have Cocina Madrigal in south Phoenix.",

Given my brother's good taste in food, I knew we were in for some good eats.    For starters, we went with the caramelized pineapple guacamole and their Oaxaca con Queso. The guacamole was on point. The pineapple gave the dish a real nice, refreshingly sweet flavor. As for the Oaxaca, oh my gosh, it was awesome. You have to try it to appreciate how darn good it is.  Dinner continued with some great entrees.  I ordered the Artichoke and Mushroom Stuffed Chicken. I was planning on sticking with a more common Mexican Dish but the thought of cilantro pesto chicken with artichoke, mushroom, and pepita seeds sounded uncommon and tasty.  The dish ended being as good as it sounded and popular with everyone who tried it.   Lastly, even though I think our entire table was full, we had to have their churros and coconut pie. The warm churros and dipping sauce were a hit and the good old fashioned coconut pie was as good as any grandma could make.  As you have read, the food was divine but just as special was the service.  From the hostess, to the waitress, to the chef and owner, all greeted us and made sure we were happy.  They went out of their way to make us feel at home and that is just what Cocina Madrigal was to us that night.  We will be back soon and I already have my mind set on my next order.",

I have to be honest, I was a little skeptical at first but I'm always open to try out new restaurant so we decided to give this place a try. Wow! I was not disappointed. All these reviews are accurate. This place is awesome. The food is top notch. I have to say that so far, this place is the best Mexican restaurant I have ever had since I moved to Arizona 5 years ago. My husband loves Mexican food and he has always tried to bring me to all these different Mexican restaurants and get me into liking Mexican food but I wasn't impressed and was really into it. After today, this place has changed my mind. We ordered Hatch Green Chile pork as a starter. I then had chicken and wild mushroom enchiladas as an entree. My husband had a burrito. Everything was delicious. They weren't overly seasoned, or overly slapped with cheese to try to make the dish taste better. The amount of seasoning and cheese and everything were just right. They were flavorful and delectable. I also had a house margarita and oh boy! That thing was strong and good. Don't expect this place to be fancy and all. It's just a little shabby little place, like a little hole in the wall (or in the neighborhood) but it's totally worth your visit and your business. I live quite far from this place but I definitely won't mind driving all the way down here for some food Mexican food.",

    "text": "What if you had achieved elite status as a corporate chef for a well known nationwide restaurant empire?  You'd probably stick with that gig for awhile I suspect.  But what if you left all of that behind to start your own place?  I can well imagine myself being pretty terrified, but Chef Leo Madrigal seems like he's had a plan all along.  As of my visit here on a Friday during happy hour, Cocina Madrigal is the #2 restaurant in all of the valley on Yelp.  Given the abundance of Mexican food spots in the valley, that's really saying something.  So it was with curiosity (and hunger) that I made the journey to south Phoenix.  It's easy to miss Cocina Madrigal, located in a nondescript beige building on the northwest corner of 16th Street and Wood (about a 5 minute drive south of Downtown Phoenix in the South Mountain neighborhood).  There's outdoor patio seating for probably 20 or so, but as mentioned the outside doesn't look like much.  The interior however is a super relaxed almost cantina style Mexican restaurant.  The interior can probably cram in up to 80 with the room pretty much equally split in two.  One side has a dining room, the other side has the bar and some overflow dining seating.  Arriving just after 4pm, I saddled up to the bar itself which can seat about a dozen patrons (and did by 4:30).  Chef Leo Madrigal is the man behind the menu at Z'Tejas, part of the Paul Fleming restaurant empire (which includes Flemings Steakhouse, Paul Martin's, Pei Wei, and PF Chang's) that at one point had dozens of locations around the country including the valley.  But before Z'Tejas' eventual demise, Leo decided it was time to move on and do his own thing.  And Leo is largely keeping his menu approachable while also feeling slightly upscale.  Traditional Mexican favorites abound but there's also some Italian, Jamaican, and even Mediterranean notes here and there.  For my first spin here I kept it pretty traditional.  The mantra according to the menu is Tacos & Tequila.  Well alright then, let's start with a house margarita on the rocks.  A little salt on the rim, the right mix of citrus and tequila, and you've got a winner to start things off.  Now for the food.  I skipped the chips and salsa.  I wanted room for other good stuff.  So I began with a cup (which is basically a bowl) of chicken tortilla soup.  Roasted and pulled chicken, slices of avocado, fried tortilla strings, and even some cotija cheese in a savory broth.  They'd whipped up their first batch for the dinner crowd so I got it fresh.  And boy was it.  Tender chunks of chicken, mixed with a great crunch from the strings and plenty of avocado and cheese to smooth it out.  One of the best tortilla soups I've had (right up there with Roaring Fork's).  For my main entree, it was taco time.  Basically you get a three taco platter with rice and beans.  I opted for a chicken, pork, and steak taco.  The chicken taco includes avocado, cheese, red beans, and pico de gallo.  The pork taco includes roasted pineapple, bacon, red onion and cilantro.  The steak taco includes fried peppers, gorgonzola cheese, and a chipotle pomegranate marinade.  A glorious trio.  I got them all with corn tortillas (the only way to go in my book) and the flavors of the marinades and cheeses popped in every one of them.  They're also bigger than your average street tacos.  Finally, there's just one dessert here, but apparently they only need one.  Their churros dessert is accompanied by a cup of cream and doused in caramel.  Easily sharable, but I demolished this thing.  The main reason?  The creamy center of the churros.  Mix that in with the cinnamon crunch of the exterior plus the cream and caramel?  A perfect bookend.  Total cost for all the food, margarita, tax and tip came to about $38.  Fans longing for the flavors and creativity of Z'Tejas' glory days will no doubt find some of the menu familiar, but without the elegance or pretentiousness of a corporate restaurant.  In fact Chef Leo himself came out to shake my hand and ask me for feedback on my experience at the end of my meal.  Talking to Leo, there's little doubt he's thrilled to have a place to call his own.  And its clear the valley has responded, giving the South Mountain neighborhood a food destination.  Z'Tejas may be long gone, but Leo Madrigal is clearly not going anywhere.  Lucky us.",

    "text": "The other day, an outsider scolded me on Yelp, claiming that because I'm from Phoenix and Phoenix food lacks flavor, that my opinions are irrelevant when reviewing any establishment outside of the city (i.e. San Diego, Los Angeles, etc).  After giving this insult more thought than I probably should have, I regret not following up with the individual to find out just exactly what restaurants they are basing their opinion on. Because while we're definitely guilty of a lot of crap restaurants, especially Mexican ones that give the cuisine a horrid reputation, Cocina Madrigal definitely isn't one of them.  If you read up a little bit on chef Leo Madrigal, you'll find that the guy has some respectable \"food cred\" in both the corporate world with Z'Tejas, as well as playing a role in developing menus at a few other popular joints like Hopdoddy and Taco Guild.   In short, there's a lot of great stuff to be found here, most notably with their enchiladas and guacamole. We've visited on two separate occasions and despite some initial hiccups with service screw-ups, have been mostly pleased with their offerings.  Madrigal offers some very good guacamole, but despite their affinity for adding things like pineapple or jalapeno bacon, we've found that it works best in its purest form. Excellent flavor depth, without being guilty of overkill. Additionally, the fundido packs a bit of spice, but is also very good. Their grilled elote is a bit unusual, exhibiting a subtle sweetness to it, almost like a caramel of sorts. It is good, but kind of threw us both off a bit.   During our first visit, both of our orders were completely screwed up. My girlfriend ordered the chicken enchiladas, but received the mushroom variant. Since she was pleased with the taste, she opted not to say anything. But after finally getting to try the chicken during our return, she actually was surprised to find that she preferred the mushrooms.  I've tried a variety of their tacos, which are all executed very well - even if I've always been partial to street-size. They clearly know what they're doing in this department.  In a rather bizarre choice, I actually ordered their Madrigal Burger as well, which is much better than I expected at a place like this. Meat was juicy, flavorful, and the additional ingredients balanced everything out nicely.   As for their sides, the beans are good, while we both agree that the rice is more on the bland side. Fortunately, this seemed a bit improved during the second visit, which might have just been an inconsistency issue.  Now, for dessert, we decided to go with their coconut pie, despite many Yelp recommendations for the churros. The pie was just okay, as parts were good, while others tasted buttery (and not in a good way), but more like you're biting into a stick of margarine. We opted to skip dessert during on our second visit, but their chipotle chocolate pie sounds promising.   I wouldn't quite call them the five-star experience that others might be claiming, but I've always been a bit stingy with my ratings. However, I think that as this place grows, you'll be hearing a lot of great things about what's offered here. Some have claimed it's more upscale, but given the environment, menu choices, and presentation, I'd call it more along the lines of reasonably priced Mexican cuisine done with a modern flare by someone who has the skills to execute far better than most competitors.  For this, I see no reason to not give them a strong recommendation.",

I went during their Happy Hour time (2:30pm-6pm). There were quite a few beer specials, margaritas were $6, and the majority of appetizers were $2 off.   I decided on the frozen raspberry margarita... definitely a great choice!  There margaritas are quite strong so there is a 3 count limit.   Chips and salsa were served and there's also a house-made habanero sauce you can get on the side. Both the salsa and sauce were flavorful!  The habanero sauce wasn't too spicy but still had a great bite too it.   You can order the tacos as is or you can request to do a combination of 3 different tacos. You'll want to get them on the corn tortilla since they are made fresh to order. (Thank me later!)  I tried the fish, shrimp, and al pastor tacos. All were full of flavor and the tacos were authentic, packed with food, and extremely messy!  I feel like tacos are supposed to be messy so it made the experience even better.. make sure you have napkins handy.   All-in-all great experience!  I was told they have only been around for 10 weeks so I wish this great success!",

I had the BYO burrito and a coconut cream pie which had a lining of caramel under the coconut cream, peach margarita on the rocks, and my mom had a grilled romaine with steak. We shared the house guac- which by the way was the best guacamole and the freshest tasting I've ever had. The food is presented so well.. worth coming, don't let the outside look of the restaurant fool you, or the location.. there's flat screens on the wall and people were watching the Sunday game. Also, the peach margarita was the best margarita I've ever had.",

EVERYTHING I have had here is to die for from the homemade tortillas, the fresh guac, the steak tacos, the veggie tacos, and the grilled romaine salad (add shrimp).  After you have all that, you absolutely need to try the churros, which you dip in a creme sauce with caramel swirls.  All of this should be washed down with the mango margarita with tejin dipped rim!  I literally eat my weight in food every time I'm there.  Tom, the bartender is great, all of the wait staff has been incredible, and the owner is super friendly and will often come out and personally check on you.  I promise, you won't leave hungry.  As you can tell, I'm a big fan and a repeat customer!  ENJOY!",

The owner, Leo came out after our meal was over and talked for awhile. He is so sweet and so was our server!! Highly recommend for the food and quant, intimate atmosphere! Get the guac for sure.

The cilantro dressing complimented the flavors. Half of us got the house specialty of enchiladas. The others tacos. The mushroom enchilada was stupendous. The portions are generous.

The best item hands down is the green chili pork.... You have to get it, either as an appetizer or in your meal. It's delicious! The first time I visited, I had the tortilla soup and it was amazing, it had chunks of grilled chicken in it and avocado....the broth was flavorful... It was great.... So the next time I went in and tried it again, not nearly as good! They used shredded chicken instead of grilled and it made a big difference. If you're reading this, go back to grilled! It was so different and tasty. I always have to get the salsa (which costs money, but is really good) and last time got the trio which includes salsa, guac, and cheesy chorizo and mushrooms. This thing could have been a meal for 2 for 12$, for real. It was a lot of food. The salsa was awesome (as per usual) and I liked the cheesy chorizo thing. I didn't love the guac, it had a lot of raw onion that was somewhat overpowering, but it wasn't bad. I've also had their chicken enchiladas which were fine, but didn't hold up to the pork.   Lastly.... Do yourself a favor and get a slice of their pie.... Oh em gee is that pie good. It's so rich and creamy, I usually take a couple bites and then take the rest home and eat a little everyday until it's gone....so good.",

My parents moved us out here 40+ years ago when I was 6 months old from Chicago. In all the years I've been here I can name a very small number of Mexican food restaurants that even deserve to be called good; even less great or excellent. Most of those are actually still operating some have plummeted in quality but are still ok at least. Until today I only had 2 good or great or even better Mexican Restaurants to go to in all of the Phoenix area. Now I can happily and exuberantly say that there is a third and it is absolutely fantastic. Please go to Cocina Madrigal and enjoy the best Mexican food in all of Phoenix. When I enjoyed my first visit to Cocina Madrigal; I asked for the Chef's favorite; what ever is on the menu that is his favorite dish. I love the surprise when a good Chef or even a Good cook will make for you when you ask them to make their favorites. What the Cheff prepared and served to me was amazing. He provided a delicious sample of his favorites from the menu. A fish taco, a steak taco and the most surprising and absolutely delicious mushroom enchilada. Although I give the enchilada high praise it was the steak taco that was my favorite. And yes being a carnivore that is also a balanced omnivore; I absolutely would order the mushroom enchilada again especially if I wanted to eat light. Congratulations Cocina Madrigal for surpassing my long standing top two Mexican Restaurants in all of Phoenix with one fantastic dinner. Thank you. We will be back.",

Stared with guac made to order. Great Margaritas, rocks or frozen. Gary highlighted the menu offerings and the service was friendly and attentive. Afterwards we had a chance to meet owner/chef Leo Madrigal. This place is a winner. In an area that is currently pretty industrial, it is quick shot from Sky Harbor and south of 17 on S.16th. Give it a try. Chef's efforts should be both rewarding and rewarded.",

One would hope, with such a small, focused menu, that everything on there it was delicious, but it simply wasn't. It's hard for a Mexican food place to screw up Mexican food in my experience, but this place has found a way to do so.  Everything was lacking in flavor, there was no real cohesion, and in general it felt like all the offerings had been \"cleaned up\" to look nice. The problem is that Mexican food is supposed to be home cooked, with fat and salt, and blending together in one beautiful, glorious, delicious plateful.  They seem to have taken all of that magic and thrown it away, without providing any reason to do so. There are so many Mexican food places in Phoenix, and I believe you can do better at just about any one of them.",

Chips were warm and not too salty. Salsa had excellent flavor and was not too hot so most people should like it. We were given a sample of their habanero salsa that definitely was hot but also had that great habanero flavor.  For lunch, I had chicken enchiladas and my friend had barbacoa enchiladas. These dishes were executed perfectly and had lots of flavor. The beans were amazing. Perfect texture and just the right amount of heat. For the area you don't expect this much attention to detail. This is a special place in an area that's been lacking.  Welcome to the neighborhood Cocina Madrigal. I look forward to being a regular.",

This family-run authentic restaurant is a great example of what Phoenix's community is all about. Food: So, I love tacos. I love finding new, fresh tasting tacos. This is the place. Handmade corn tortillas are made-to-order. They are light and thin but enough to deliver the goods. I tried the shrimp and fish tacos. Both tacos were amazing. They were perfect explosions of taste in your mouth, with obviously fresh ingredients. The sauce in the fish tacos made you longing for more bites. Even the iced tea was top-notch (not kidding). After the first sip, my friend and I both said: \"Whoa that's really good tea\". I haven't stopped thinking about our experience since dining there last Friday. We will be back - and I'm hoping it's within the next 7 days :)",

Walking in at first there is a 'homey' feel. Everyone was eager to seat us and was super friendly. The bar is stocked with some of the best tequila, all the good domestic Mexican beer. I stuck with my favorite strawberry jarritos.  My dad had already been here 3 times and was itching to take us for his birthday. Immediately he ordered us the made to order guacamole with pina & jalapeno bacon. Despite the pineapple not coming out the first time with the dish, the chef was quick to fix the issue. He brought out a second batch with the pineapple and it was on the house. He even brought out my little brothers burrito first. You could tell he really cared to have a lasting impression on each table in the restaurant and took pride in his dishes. Everything was delicious. All the meats in the tacos & enchiladas are marinated and seasoned so well. The churros were amazing and you can't skip getting those! I'd go back just for those. I'm excited to recommend this place to all my customers, these guys deserve it. It's customer service yes, but these guys are serving hospitality.",

Get ahead of the wave by checking out this local restaurant out before all your friends are talking about it and the line is out the door. Everything is made fresh to order, from the guacamole to the corn tortillas. And trust me, it makes a difference. Their taco selection is great, and if you can't decide on one, try up to three different kinds! Highly recommend the Al Pastor, Oaxaca Shrimp, and Achioye Braised Chicken. While you wait for your food, let the chips and salsa hold you over. Just make sure to save room for the main course (and desert) because you'll want to finish every bite of everything that's in front of you!",

This is my new all time favorite spot. The trio off the appetizer menu is my go to. I usually go to Cocina Madrigal just for the trio and some margaritas. The mushroom enchilada has such a great blend of flavors, not spicy at all. I've had the tacos as well, favorite is the pork (the flavor the meat holds is so good.) The service is spot on. The workers constantly hustle cause it's always so busy, but they're extremely kind and attentive. Love keeping my money in South Phoenix at this restaurant!! Although it's popularity has grown as quick as it has, I'm so happy their customer service and quality of food remains amazing.",

Walking through the door we were greeted by a near roar of happy patrons. The host was friendly and we were seated immediately.  The menu was approachable (not overwhelming), with plenty of options. Everything sounded amazing! Chips and salsa weren't free, but they were less than $2 for a very generous portion which was refilled as needed.  I got a margarita and the steak tacos, and my husband got a chicken burrito. The tacos were PHENOMENAL-- I couldn't believe the complexity of flavor and beautiful visual presentation. The server was friendly and helpful, and the owner came to check on us. We will 100% be back, soon, and often.",

I had three tacos the chicken, the steak, and the fish to get a variety. They let you mix and match. The chicken and the steak were amazing. The flavors were incredible. The steak taco had fried battered onion and pepper strings (the chef is probably cringing at my attempt to explain this) that were so flavorful and added a nice light crunchy texture. I really enjoyed them. The fish taco was also good it was just outshown by the flavors in the other two. We will definitely be coming back. I need to leave room for the coconut pie next time.",

But it is a five star yelp review. It's casual and they're super friendly. Best frozen marg I've ever had. I got the steak burrito and she got the pork barbacoa enchiladas. Both were sublime. Guacamole made fresh to order and was perfect. I like heat so I asked if they have any sauces and the bartender brought out all the usuals and then went back and got me a fresh made habanero salsa. Sooooo good. Excellent service, excellent food. Came out as ordered and timely. Cannot give a restaurant a better review in my opinion.  10/10 would recommend.",

The staff is very friendly and outgoing. They are very interested in making sure every aspect of your experience is taken care of.  We are worried they will become to famous that when we want to go it will be too busy. The beer is cold and the raspberry margarita is refreshing too strong for my wife so that was good for me. I thought it was perfect. We had the Oaxaca Fundido appetizer, perfect spice sausage and grilled onions awesome. We split three mushroom enchiladas so delicious and three plate tacos two fish and one vegetable. Everything was so fresh from the fish to the cilantro very tasty. Rice and beans complimented the dish as well. Not refried beans, just beans with sprinkles of cheese. Also tasted great. Wanted to have dessert but to full glad the portions are large so we got left overs too. I warned our son that those left overs are off limits for sure. Sorry so long of a review but I'm excited for finding this gem. Good luck to them..",
