They made special off menu dishes for the kids, and all was cooked to perfection. A little bit of a drive for me in N. Scottsdale but very well worth it. Excellent restaurant.",

The been and goat cheese salad was beautiful and delicious.  I asked for \"as rare as possible\" for my lamb, and it was RARE.  Awesome.  My wife had the halibut&sea bass, which was also awesome.  When we started hemming and hawing about the dessert, the waiter decided to bring us one of each.  All were great, but my wife liked the coconut and pineapple pie most, while I leaned toward the strawberry cobbler.   It's a beautiful place, the portions are a good size, and the waiter was wonderful and non-presumptuous.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places to have brunch in Phoenix. I visited Vincent's Market Bistro Sunday the 11th. I met a girlfriend of mine for brunch and we were sat at our table immediately - it was about 10:45 AM. The server first brought us a fresh plate of warmed homemade croissants and blueberry preserves as he took our drink order. The coffee is good and served with cream if you like. The menu selection at brunch has appetizers, a couple of entrees, and traditional breakfast items. My personal favorite is the selection of quiche which is served with a side salad. You must try the quiche - any of the selections- at least once! The flaky pastry crust with the light crusted top and the savory custard whipped filling you fork glides through so smoothly - so delicious! It's a perfectly filling portion for brunch. There are so many good food options to pick from. The atmosphere is nice to have conversation - not too loud and not too quiet. At the end of our meal, we each were presented with an expected dessert dish (one chocolate and one blueberry) both were amazing!! The service is outstanding, the food is delicious and I will always keep going back to this lovely little brunch spot in Phoenix.",

    "text": "On a Sunday morning in phoenix, you are often left thinking about the fact that a good breakfast is neither close nor available.  In fact, you could sum up the valleys breakfast nooks as vacant or un found.  There is one beacon of breakfast hope that can be found in the central corridor, and Vincents be thy name.  Obviously Vincents is a culinary staple in the valley that is known far and wide and adorned by all.  What is somewhat unknown to valley foodies is that right behind the main Vincents restaurant sits \"Vincents Bistro.\"  What does that mean to the food masses? The best price point in the valley on fine dining in a great setting.  Before you engage the menu, make sure to enjoy the house made croissants and butter, this little treat will get your senses going in the right direction.    The menu at the Bistro is not complex(neither is the main dining room), but has staples such as Vincents famous smoked salmon quesedilla($10) and main lobster with handmade basil pasta($14).  The Bistro has a daily prix fixe menu that uses the following methodology. An appetizer of choice, a main entree of choice and dessert.  The price tag is never greater than $20 for the prix fixe and I challenge another restaurant in the valley to beat it.  Choices can range from prime new york steak, to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish.  What are the cons? Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation.  Wait times for pick up can range from forty-five minutes to over an hour.  If you feel like your caught in the middle of a whirlwind circus when picking up your order, don't worry, that's just the normal pace.    In 1982 Vincent Guerithault catapulted Arizona into the beginning phases of the culinary elite the other larger metropolis cities were already enjoying.  Now, thirty years later, he has done it again with the Bistro.  I applaud Vincent and his family on their success and longevity in the valley culinary circuit.",

We had 7.30 pm reservations and arrived on time to find probably 12 guests standing around waiting for their tables....we joined them. My husband became bored and walked around the small place, counting 10 tables waiting to be cleared.  20 minutes later, no one had offered us a drink, no cocktail serving person was to be seen, but at last we were seated! 15 more minutes passed slowly by. No acknowledgement of our presence...no welcoming smiles,hellos,eye contact.....ah at last water was poured into our glasses.Yes, there is some liquid refreshment available in this arid place.....WATER! Still no acknowledgement. The water bearer was silent and did not look up from his task......hello here's the waiter asking us for our order......er,\"may we see the menu first?\". Do you serve drinks in this restaurant?  May we order something to drink? Yes we had to ask.   Let's speak briefly about the food.  SALAD.......a salty undressed mess, Brie and figs......NO FIGS. Tomato leek tartlet....very good.  Filet steaks....tasteless. Lobster and pasta.....it wasn't lobster it was langoustine.....no flavor.  Salmon....ok. As for the desserts great pecan pie, ruined by pouring caramel sauce over it.  We all know that pecan pie is sweet enough, don't we?  After all this, the final straw was the very annoying waiter, who hummed incessantly as he served.  In all fairness he was totally unaware of his habit, as was everyone else who worked there....otherwise surely he would have been told to STOP. No we will not be returning.  So many great restaurants in the camelback corridor....why would we?",

My favorites are the pork loin, beef bourguignon, or any of the daily prix-fixe menus. The plates are a modest size, so I recommend the prix fixe menu or an appetizer salad if you are starved. Before you order, the server brings you a plate of buttery homemade croissants. After every meal you are given a complimentary dessert. Frankly, if you're on a budget, you can order just a main plate (with the free croissants and dessert) and you will leave the Bistro full and satisfied with a $15 ish dent in your wallet. On the other extreme, you can have a decadent 3 or 4 course meal with a bottle of French wine and easily pay upwards of $50 a person. The food is all served on beautiful vintage Villeroy & Boch china with whimsical patterns of flowers or horses. The space of the Bistro is intimate: tightly packed tables, no hostess stand, low ceilings. I love it. The customers here tend to be a bit older and I've never seen kids at the Bistro.",

    "text": "Last Thursday, my husband and I visited this establishment and were pleasantly surprised.  The staff were well trained and didn't falter even when there were a lot of demands on them from hungry customers. The croisants that were served rather quickly were warm, buttery and very hard to resist. We both chose the Prix Fixe dinner.  My husband had the mushroom raviolis which were served in a rich sauce and were very flavorful.  I had the caesar salad which was a little larger than I expected, but it could have used a little more dressing.  The lamb dinner consisted of four perfectly prepared chops, along with potatoes  dauphinois and snap peas.  For our dessert course I chose the Profiterole which is a tower of small, ice cream filled puff pastries.  This was good.  My husband ordered the peach tart and was somewhat disappointed.  The peaches were not as tender as they could have been.  This may have been due to re-heating the pastry. My husband and several of the \"regulars\" we spoke to agreed that Vincent Market Bistro serves some of the best lamb served in the valley. On our next visit, we will arrive around 5:30 instead of 6:30 to avoid the crowd.  The regulars park just to the west of the Bistro when the free parking spots are filled.  The wine can be a bit pricey so check the price before ordering.  Be prepared to be in rather tight quarters with a rather high noise level.  We will be back!",

    "text": "Three of us arrived on a Sunday for breakfast and there was no one to take your name or create a list of who had arrived first, which caused some chaos.   There were two groups in front of us who were doing some minor squabbling with each other over who should get the next available table. I walked in to the main counter, and a waiter approached me. He told me it would 10-15 mins for my party of three.  I went back to the patio and waited in line. A man and his parents arrived after us, asked me where they should put their name down, and I told him to just inform a waiter you're here.  After about 20 minutes (and now that we're next in line) a table opened up and the man with his parents just walked over and sat down. I followed, told him we were next in line and he just responded, \"There is no 'real' line.\"  That guy was clearly a schmuck, but the reason it happened was Vincent Market Bistro had no system to create a list for who should be seated in order of arrival. Considering that even the IHOP has mastered this concept, one would hope Vincent can get a grip on it going forward.  To be fair, the manger came over later and apologized and gave us a mountain of free deserts. But, he had no real response as to why there isn't a host or hostess to keep people happy.  The croissants are amazing, the ham and Gruyere omelette was average, and the service was decent (once we were seated, which we did ourselves since no one offered to seat us at anytime.)  Kinda crazy, but for the hassle involved, I'd rather just go to Snooze down the street. It's an hour wait there, but at least they have a hostess.",

Although I thought there were a few too many tables in this small space, I still found it cozy and intimate.  I had a hard time deciding between trying a pizza (the Four Cheese had my attention with mozzarella, bleu, brie, and goat cheeses with pesto) or a full-blown dinner (particularly the Shrimp Crepe with avocado corn salsa).  But the Prix Fixe won with three courses for a very reasonable price ($25 I think).    They allowed me to substitute lobster bisque for the soup offered, and it was very rich, and buttery, and lobstery.  The halibut/sea bass duo was my preferred entree.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly sized given it was sandwiched between a cream soup and dessert.  The pot de creme was surprisingly and pleasantly, not chocolate.  Although I like chocolate, I prefer it as an element of a dessert, not the main ingredient.  Only \"getting too old to remember shit\" me can't remember the flavor..I believe it was raspberry.  What I do remember is that it was very good.  Our server was delightful in responding to our 101 questions about the menu.  It was a lovely meal overall.  Note to self:  go back soon.",

    "text": "I was visiting my friend in Phoenix and we used yelp to find a French restaurant and so glad we picked this one!  We went for brunch and I was really craving quiche, so I chose a ham quiche and also Vincent's panini. My friend is vegan and she asked server some questions about modifying what she wanted to order and server was so nice and accommodating! If he wasn't sure about something, he made sure to go ask the chef and check to see if it can be done and it didn't matter how many questions we had. He is from Mauritius so I ended up speaking a bit of French with him and he was so sweet to even compliment my French as I don't get to practice it often. I ended up telling him I was visiting and it was my early birthday. So, what a wonderful surprise it was that at the end of our meal he brought out a dessert for me and one for my friend also!  If I lived in Phoenix, this would definitely be my go-to-place. Very cozy/homey interior, delicious food and very reasonably priced with caring servers that go out of their way to make your dining experience enjoyable!",

They have the prix fixe menu (3 course for 25$), but you don't even need to order this if you don't want to, we ordered two apps and two entrees and they brought out surprise desserts for us at the end (we didn't even mention it was our anniversary, I think they do this all the time), also it was less than 25$ pp...we each had wine and coffee and I think our bill was about 65$ or so. The food was very good, I had the coq au vin and it was delicious, rich flavor, and even better the next day. The desserts were wonderful, a chocolate pot and a lemon raspberry dessert...yum! The coffee was great too. I will certainly be back!",

Many tables at our Sunday brunch were ordering from the drink menu.  I had the poached eggs florentine, which was very good.  My husband had an omelet with ham and gruyere cheese but did share later that it was overcooked and the gruyere was almost absence.  The buttery rolls they serve before the meal are delicious--hot and fresh from the oven.  They give everyone a complimentary small dessert after your meal.  Our table had a selection of a fresh brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, a lemon bar with blueberries and creme brulee.  Their creme brulee is to die for!  The restaurant is frequented by a lot of old times--I imagine they've been heading to Vincents for many, many years.  The service is excellent and the wait staff seems to know a lot of the patrons.  Overall, the restaurant prices are very reasonable, especially given the warm rolls and a complimentary dessert.  However, the sound level can be quite loud at times, and there is a real need for some updating of their restaurant's decor.  If you don't mind these last two elements, the food and service will rarely disappoint.",

The food, as all the reviews here have said, is wonderful, and our waiter Elijah was attentive and efficient, as well as helping to make our evening a lot of fun with his outgoing, positive personality and his showmanship while serving.  Between my wife and me, we had the lobster quiche and the mixed seafood skewer, and both were excellent. Before this meal, I had evidently never eaten a real quiche, as the lobster quiche was above and beyond what I had previously thought of as quiche.  It's that good.  We also split a margherita pizza for an appetizer, which was good but not something I would say is a must-have.  Contrary to what Dick G. mentioned about parking in his review, we self-parked in the lot behind the restaurant, and there were no fees.  Perhaps he went the valet route?",

Tucked behind Vincent's on Camelback, the bistro is comfy, quaint, and perfectly reminiscent of a Parisian cafe. I come for brunch typically once a month. The food is always fresh and flavorful, portions are perfect, and the menu is varied enough to please anyone's palate. Once seated, patrons are greeted with freshly made mini-croissants and preserves. The mimosas are superb. The staff are friendly but not overly attentive (for example, if you want to sit and talk after your place is cleared, they aren't going to usher you out.) And after the meal, they bring you a small dessert (always different, always delicious, always just the right size.) My only request in exchange for sharing this little known gem: parents, please be considerate of other diners (i.e., think twice about bringing fussy babies or toddlers.) It's a small space...   Definitely one of my favorites. Bon appetit!",

I had the ravioli and my mother had salmon on a bed of rice with cream sauce.  I had a bite of hers and loved the flavors!  Dad had a salad with a lobster bisque, I had a bowl too, and it was wonderfully creamy.  The great thing was the salad came with two poached eggs which gave it a good portion size.  The best part was they gave us three free desserts!  One was flourless chocolate cake, another berry, and the third apple, all with a little dollop of ice cream.  It was a lovely meal.",

    "text": "There's an interesting trend developing among some of the valley's most popular fine dining establishments.  As a way of getting more customers in the door, they are offering smaller menus consisting of more economical dishes almost as an introduction to their unique cuisine.  Binkley's now has numerous Cafe Bink locations that offer this experience and others are following suit.  Including, apparently, Vincent Guerithault.  I have to give HUGE props to my date for discovering this spot that I never knew even existed until tonight.  I've been to Vincent On Camelback more than once and was a little nervous when she told me she wanted Vincent for dinner.  I know their food is good, but pretty spendy.  But before I could raise an objection she mentioned they now have a bistro offering a cheaper menu next door.  Wha?  Sure enough I met her here after work for dinner and as I traverse the narrow parking lot past Vincent's mothership, there's the bistro.  A small nook tucked in the middle of an already tucked away restaurant.  The bistro has a small outdoor patio with the rest of the dining area opening up to the patio.  On a perfect weather evening like tonight, its a great indoor/outdoor setup.  Altogether the bistro can seat somewhere around 25-30 people tops.  Not big, but not cramped either.  The walls, the paintings, and the music still feel like Vincent, but in a much more relaxed casual setup.  The menu offers one of three different dining options.  You can order a la carte, a $25 prix fixe menu consisting of three courses (which change everyday), or you can order from their menu of pizzas.  The pizzas seem a little out of place here since the theme is predominantly French, but I didn't order those so that's neither here nor there.  The prix fixe menu had some interesting options that evening, but there was one a la carte dish that immediately caught my attention.  Duck confit.  When done right, duck confit is amazing as I've had a ridiculously good duck confit dish at Zinc Bistro in Scottsdale.  The dish here was served with lentils and bacon.  The duck was tender and the meat fell off the bone with ease.  The savoriness of the duck and the heartiness of the bacon paired tremendously and the portion was just the right size.  Prior to the main event, we split a three cheese tarine.  Essentially a plate of three cheese bruschetta.  The bread slices weren't big, but super rich.  Paired very well with the wines we had.  We actually didn't order dessert, but we each got a chocolate brownie piece with vanilla bean ice cream on the house.  A tasty way to top off the night and oh yeah it was complimentary!  Our server was extremely polite and soft spoken and the pace of the meals were spot on.  Both of us left full, but not uncomfortably so.  All totaled, two glasses of wine, the bruschetta appetizer, a pair of main courses, two desserts, and tip was $70.  Far cheaper than Vincent's parent restaurant, while still offering the quality service, ambience, and flavors that Vincent is known for.  I would still recommend Vincent's parent restaurant for the ultimate French cuisine experience as their dishes are even more imaginative.  But for those looking to just dip their toes into Vincent's menu or looking for a cheaper alternative, the Bistro makes for a tremendous plan B.",

We kind of stood around and they told us we could sit there if we wanted to. We sat down, but there were still other people waiting who apparently didn't want to sit outside. I don't know if we were hard to see or if its just because they were busy, but we waited at least 20 minutes before anyone came to our table.   I ordered the prix fixe (butternut squash ravioli, beef brisket, and some eclaire type dessert that started with a p). My girlfriend had the pizza with bacon.   I don't know if its because it is a european style restaurant or what, but every course took forever, it took us two and a half hours to have dinner.  My squash ravioli in creme sauce was amazing, but there were literally only two of them.   The croissant basket that we received was ok, they were a little burned.  The beef brisket was awful. It was soaked in some kind of sauce that reminded me of gym socks. I would not order it again. The veggies on the side were lightly cooked, very little seasoning, and very fresh, these were great.  My girlfriend said her pizza was ok, but not anything special.   The dessert is what really stole the show. I have no idea what mine was called (it started with a P and was really long, I couldn't pronounce it), but dear god it was amazing. I could have eaten a meal of just that.   They did bring my girlfriend a small brownie with ice cream as well, which she appreciated.   I don't know if we would go back if this is a typical dinner experience. Maybe just get dessert to go.",

I am the youngest person in there by about 40 years every time I go but I don't care, I don't know anywhere else in the valley that has the same combo of charm, service, food quality, and cheap prices as this place.  Is the food culinary magic? NO, but who would expect it to be at $20 for 3 courses?  Are portions huge? NO, but you can't even get out of cheesecake factory at that price (not that I'd want 3 courses at cheesecake, but you get the idea...).  Unfortunately word is getting out and it is getting more and more crowded every time I go!! Great part is they will sometimes allow overflow to sit in one of the actual Vincent's dining rooms which instantly expands seating!",

    "text": "Welcome to Paris in the desert. Je t'aime Vincent's. Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ.   I've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well.   When I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think \"oh yikes, here comes a pricey night,\" but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite.   Vincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's.",

I have never been to France but I think that this is what it would feel like. Great decor, wine bottles being opened frequently, and excellent food that I can't pronounce.   I had the Duck Confit and loved it. The duck had a nice skin on it and it was presented on top of a bed of lentils that complimented the richness of the Duck very nicely. The house salad was crisp and fresh and the dessert, which was brought out for free, was a delight.  Had the privilege of meeting both the manager and the head chef and can say that both are wonderful people who are passionate about giving great experiences and great food.   Be aware that there are no reservations for small parties but I can't think of a better place for a great date that won't break the bank.

I had the lobster bisque for a starter and coq au vin for my main. My partner had the same starter and beef bourgogne for her main. We both had profiteroles for dessert. Yummy!! Everything was spot on. Our only complaint last March was that it was so hot in the restaurant, I almost had to leave. We gave them a pass because we thought it was kind of between seasons so we thought maybe they just weren't ready to turn the air on yet but really, it was way too hot!  So, we decided to give it another try. We ordered the tart flambe and e goat cheese nachos for starters. They were both out of this world, so good. For mains, I again ordered coq au vin and my partner ordered mussels and frites. The coq au vin was a little dry this time around but we were there at the end of the evening, so... Not really a good excuse. I was totally looking forward to the profiteroles but instead, we didn't get the chance to order them. They brought us out a brownie with ice cream. It was good but def not the profiteroles, those are amazing, maybe they ran out.  Here's the kicker, it was beastly hot again, even the servers were sweating like crazy. They seemingly had the air on but not high enough. It was miserable, so while the food was great and def worth repeated visits, I can't take the heat so I'll sadly have to stay out of their kitchen. Please Vincents, get the air working, so I can come back. Food was a little hit or miss but mostly hits. The apps were def worth a repeat visit. I'm def torn between a 3 and a 4 but then food is really a 4.",

Well, you found it.  This is the \"little secret place\" you take your out of town friends to. This is the place you lose track of time at with your good friends, laughing and eating the whole morning away until you leave stuffed, totally happy and ready to relax and enjoy the rest of your day.  Love this place. Easy to recommend. We have wandered in on Saturday and Sunday anywhere between 9 and 11am and never had an issue finding a seat. Very casual experience. Start with a cappuccino, enjoy the fresh hot croissants for a while, maybe get a chocolate one (dear god, so good), maybe another cup of coffee, order some breakfast, talk, laugh and just enjoy.  Then be shocked at the end of this beautiful meal when the bill comes, and it is no more than any other breakfast place and the owner probably didn't even charge you for some of the items just so you'd have a better experience (happened every time we've gone). Vincent's place has a really wonderful/relaxed energy that is all about enjoying your day and we do every time we go.",

This is a great place to just come, relax, and enjoy a nice weekend  brunch.  The food is fresh and outstanding, and as always, the service is perfect.  Great place to take people who are in town visiting for a truly exceptional meal.",

    "text": "Gotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality.   To start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.  **Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.  What we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.  What the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)  Everything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not \"bad\" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.  Even better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!  I will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)",

    "text": "Why would anybody wait for Restaurant Week when Vincent Market Bistro is priced better than Restaurant Week every day!  Vincent Market Bistro is a Comfortable Casual French Style Bistro that offers exceptional service and delicious French Style Food with South West Style accents. It doesn't matter if you order off the $25. Prix Fixe 3 Course Menu or the A La Carte Menu your not going to spend much either way. Everyone here drinks wine you either order a glass or two or a bottle. The other thing to keep in mind is that there is no late night here I think they stop serving around 8pm.  I've been here a bunch of times and all the food is always fantastic! They always start you off with Buttery Fresh Croissants on super adorable plates. I particularly enjoy steak here more than anyplace else because it's always delicious and not too big of a portion. I also always enjoy the fresh seafoods they offer that usually come with a Basil Beurre Blanc Sauce. My husband thinks the Duck Confit and the lamb are better and more enjoyable here than most others he has tried. No matter what you order it will be delicious with fresh herbs and properly prepared.   The desserts are always delicious and are worth the calories.  The Service here is always very professional and warm.  I always enjoy every dinner from Vincent Market Bistro.  As a slight update 6-1-15 the Prix 3 course is now $29.00 and is still terrific!",

This is a great place for a date night or dinner with friends.    Vincent is a superb chef and Phoenix has been blessed to have him put down roots here.  The bistro is a great addition.   .",

    "text": "Vincent's was my third restaurant week stop for Spring 2014, and is a five star but my restaurant week visit was a bit of a bummer.  Their food is fantastic. Their service is fantastic. It is an expensive restaurant, with the entrees in the mid thirties each, but worth every penny. I hate spending a lot of money and leaving a place underwhelmed, but I'll happily spend it at a place like this!  On the down side, this is the only restaurant this week, so far, that when I told them I wouldn't be eating dessert, they didn't sub out something else. I forgive them a bit considering of all the places, they are taking the biggest hit in terms of average revenue per table during restaurant week, but let me compare this to two years ago...  Two years ago a fourth guest spontaneously joined my table of three. Then she said she wasn't eating, she just wanted to hang out... I was a bit embarrassed by this, but said nothing. Then she started to eat off of everyone's plates! During restaurant week, that's completely unacceptable, and they could have been quite justified in charging us a plate sharing fee (which this year is $20).  Instead, Vincent's showed their incredible finesse and taste. They brought her an empty plate to make her food stealing easier! Then, at dessert time, they didn't ask what we wanted, they just bought one of each of the four available desserts! They said, \"well there were four of you, so we just thought you would like one of each.\" Even though she didn't pay a dime. This was a deeply classy way to say we see what you are doing but will not stoop to your level...  I left a large tip (about 33%), and have told countless people about how Vincent's is the number one date place on my list for great food and service above and beyond any I've ever seen.  So this year (my sixth time going, three during restaurant week, three regular visits), it was really disappointing that they didn't even try to be creative with me. And no, it was not busy when we were there. I almost feel like the waitress didn't even ask or something and made the call herself.  I bet a manager would have come to explain if they had made that call. The difference between two years ago was a real disappointment.  But what I did eat was of course fantastic. The lobster roll was perfect on a slightly sweet roll, the ravioli was delicious and delicate. Just what I expected.  So I am only rating them four stars for this review for their lack of empathy and creativity, and for being less amazing than they used to be. But it really is my favorite date place so maybe next year, I'll give them the star back.",

Eating at Vincent reminds me of my restaurant experience in Europe, very cozy. Food is really good. Don't ask which one on the menu is good. You won't go wrong with anything. And everything is homemade, jam with croissant, pasta, ice cream, etc. Price is much cheaper than Vincent Camelback, but food quality and taste are matched. Actually they share some of the menu items, such as Maine lobster with pasta, rack of lamb, halibut, etc. This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Can't wait to go back.",

Scottsdale friend here for her Birthday Dinner based on reviews from some friends on Yelp and were blown away with every aspect of this Beautiful Market Bistro. Once you find the entrance and park your car you walk up to a colorful patio decorated like you would see in a French painting by Claude Monet. You notice everyone there enjoying themselves with a glass of fine wine and a table full of tasty goodies. The inside is interestingly charming and colorfully decorated in the same eloquent fashion. Nice.  We got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.  We started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entrees, the ladies ordered Sauteed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!  We had such a great time there and the bill was very reasonable for the quality of the food and the friendly service we received. We will definitely be coming back again sooner than later. Fantastique!",

    "text": "Id love to share with you my new go-to date night spot. It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building.   Chef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!   For one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation.   Pizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flambee ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.  For dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting.   Vincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of.   Great food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled. Be sure to check their website for times including breakfast, brunch and lunch.",

It can get fairly busy later in the morning, so if you're not into that go early. I have eaten here at least 15 times and have never been disappointed in anything. I love this place! I should also mention that the Saturday market is INCREDIBLE!! The food stations offer something for everyone. Local merchants hawk their wares at their stands and they always have a funky older guy tickling the ivories on his keyboard. This is a mini festival of food and fun and is a MUST do for anyone wanting to impress out of town guests. It happens every Saturday from about 9am-2pm from October until May. Be sure to park in the business lot west of the 7-11. 7-11 plaza will charge you $5. The business lot for Shamrock Foods is free parking and only a short walk.",

My son Devoured it and he is sometimes a picky eater.    My husband had the smoked salmon and before I knew it-gone.  It just melted in his mouth.  We got the panni for the kids and my husband and I ended up eating it.   I am so glad since the combination of favors was truly rewarding.  The chef is a master in the kitchen and I can't wait to go back and try another dish.  We got croissants and I would love to have the recipe for it since that is all my daughter would eat.   Recipes for all the food.  The pricing was very reasonable.   Can't believe the deserts.  There were so many and they melted in your mouth.  Wish I knew what was in all of them.  Master Chefs and than some.   Please go there and try the spectacular food.   I will be back soon.",

I found this little restaurant and realized its right next to our favorite sushi place- Sushiholics. So 40th and Camelback is my jam now!  The food was very good- I had Vincent's panini, which was nice and crunchy with a small salad included, which was refreshing. Hubby had egg in a hole, which he ate without saying a word. Seriously. The man didn't speak once except when he finished and went, \"that was really good\". I really appreciated the complimentary croissants with blueberry jam, it was warm and very comforting. We also got complimentary dessert, which I think pushed us from \"pleasantly full\" territory to \"I need to unbutton my pants\" territory. We got a brownie and apple tart with ice cream for the dessert.   Honestly, I'm very impressed that a place like this exists. It was such a lovely morning and the service was attentive and polite. The decor inside is very tasteful and it made me think of a French cafe.  Overall- will absolutely return to try other things on the menu.",

Place was jumping, full of locals and the noise level was pretty high due to a few big tables.  Wife ordered the cheese plate, I got the scrambled eggs with cream cheese and smoked slamon. Cheese plate was okay, but the toast points were like croutons, instead of grilled bread. Nothing but crunch.  Scrambled eggs were just that, a good helping of scrambled eggs piled on top of a dollop of cream cheese and some diced up smoke salmon hiding under there, too. Overall, kind of meh.  The complimentary crossiants we got to start, though, are worth a return visit. Butter would be better than the thin blueberry syrup/compote they came with, but they were great!  The server brought us a couple of desserts to try. The apple pie was good, the rum pudding was way too sweet for our taste.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably try it again and go for dinner. But I don't live in the neighborhood.  TIP: Looks like parking is at a premium here, so plan accordingly",

    "text": "This has to be one of those times where it was just a bad day. I want to believe that, I truly do. But what happened needs to be addressed.  First off, I've been here before. I came here with my husband, his brother, and the brothers bf. We had an absolute FABULOUS time. Our server was attentive,  kind, and charming. The food was hot and fresh, and our drinks were never empty... That was the first time.  This time could not have been more opposite. First, no one was a designated host/hostess. So, servers would come outside, ask how many people were in a party, then disappear. And this would happen more than once so now there are two or more servers looking for a table. Often for different parties, so you can imagine the confusion. When we were finally seated we were pointed to the general direction of the table and asked to sit. And sit we did for 10 minutes without water or menus. Not even a run by from the server to let us know that he will be right with us. Nada. At the 10 minute mark menus were all but thrown at us by a server. Still no communication.   Then our server, Elijah I believe greeted us about 5 minutes later. He took our drink order and our brunch order, since we had more than enough time to decide, and ran off. Our drinks came 10 minutes later, along with no eye contact and a muttering of \"I'll have your croissants in a minutes\". 30 minutes later, no joke, we got our croissants. They were cold and hard as rocks on the ends and did not come with the preserves they generally come with. Then 5 minutes later came our cheese plate. And then 20 minutes after that my husband got his ham and gruyere omelet and I got a plate of something that was not my order. I had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate. Thankfully I only had to wait a couple additional minutes for my Nicoise salad. Salad people.   Also, please keep in mind during that whole time, not once did the server come back. My husband had long since been out if iced tea and my mimosa glass was empty :(. We received not quite refills about 5 minutes after we received our plates. Meaning a carafe of tea was handed to my husband to serve himself and sparkling wine (half of a mimosa) was poured into my glass without a word spoken.   I will conclude with this. It was busy, but I have been a server before. I know what running around like a mad person looks like and what flat out ignoring a table looks like. Our server was chatting up other tables, so he obviously wasn't too rushed, right? We left a nice tip because we are nice people, but we will not be going through that again. Sorry Vincent's, you lost not only my husband and I, but our families as well. It's too bad.",

The service was neither here nor there, the wait staff was polite and courteous but I think they were stretched a bit thin that day possibly. The food was not really anything I would pay anywhere close to what they would have charged. The food just tasted bland and lacked flavour or zest of any kind. The dessert was exceedingly good , and was the best part of the meal. All things said and done at their price point, there are better options than this",

    "text": "It is hard see how to improve Vincent Market Bistro.  Some have complained about table crowding in this relatively small restaurant, but there is ample room to maneuver and the noise level is not a problem.    The portions are not large, but they are not ridiculously small either.  You will probably want an appetiser and a main course, and possibly a dessert.  Get them all for $28 by using the prix frix offering.  This consists of a choice from 3 appetisers, a choice from 3 entrees, and a choice from 3 desserts.  The entries are top-end items too, such as steak, lobster, or rack of lamb.  HINT: I was told that reservations are not taken, and even on a weekday the venue gets crowded.  My suggestion is to go early, like 6 o'clock.",

    "text": "Great, casual alternative to Vincent's on Camelback with the same quality food and service at a lower price point.  Similar to his Sunday Farmer's Market, Vincent Guerithault is continuing in his mission of bringing authentic French food to Phoenix. While formal French dining often has the reputation of being expensive and stuffy, everyday eating in France is not like this and Vincent's Market Bistro brings that traditional, French country dining style to the fore.  We were there with my in-laws, our kids, and my brother-in-law and his boyfriend and we were certainly not the youngest group there. In fact, there was another table composed entirely of kids from St. Francis elementary school and Brophy / Xavier high schools.  You have the choice of a prix fixe menu for $25 or individual items, but nothing is too expensive.   We started with appetizers including the smoked salmon quesadilla, the tomato and mozarella salad, and even introduced the kids to escargot, which they liked!  For the main course, I had the coq au vin and others had the duck confit, four cheese ravioli, wood fired pizzas, and beef bourguignon. Everyone enjoyed their meals and service was excellent.   As we finished up, our server, unprompted by us, brought out a selection of complimentary desserts that everyone enjoyed.  If you're looking for a nice, affordable, evening on the town with great food and great service, head over to Vincent's Market Bistro and you'll leave feeling like you've just spent a great evening in the South of France.",

    "text": "4.5/5  Free croissants + dessert, charming atmosphere and reasonably priced for what you get? I'm in heaven!   I've been wanting to try out Vincent's Bistro for quite some time. We got here right at 5 and boy am I glad we did. When we left around 6-6:30 all the tables looked filled and people were waiting outside for a spot to open up.   The menu offers traditional French classics as well as some American style cuisine. When we were here they offered a prix fixe menu, 3 courses for $29. Not bad at all! I went for the prix fixe, choosing the scallop appetizer, salmon and sole duo, with the creme Catalan for dessert.   While we waited we noshed on some tasty tantalizing mini croissants. They were served nice and warm and were perfect for appeasing my hunger until the appetizer came.   The scallops were a lovely presentation, served in a shell, nicely cooked with just the right amount of sauce and seasoning. I also really enjoyed the salmon and sole duo. The fish was perfectly cooked and so tender. It's the best cooked salmon I've had in some time.   We all shared our desserts (A chocolate cake, the creme Catalan and an almond cake). Out of the three I liked the almond cake the best with its perfectly sweet almond flavor and moist texture. The creme Catalan was reminiscent of an even richer tasting creme brulee minus the crispy crunchy caramelized top sugar layer. The chocolate cake was decent and was about the size of a brownie. It tasted about halfway between a brownie and traditional chocolate cake.   Service was prompt albeit a bit brusque. This might be due to the fact that it gets so busy here so soon. I didn't realize this at the time but after looking up their hours they close so early on Saturday, at 8 PM! No wonder it gets so busy! They don't accept reservations either unless you are a big party so make your plans accordingly.  Overall we had a lovely time and I'd love to go back again to try more off the menu.",

The soup was absolutely delicious and up to the standard I remember was Vincents. However, for the entree we ordered the lamb. I would not have thought it possible to cut a small lamb chop as thin as these were. In fact, I had to have the waiter verify that it was lamb. I had expected the small lolli-pop lamb chops which a lot of bars are offering now and that would have been fine. however, these were not even that good and were terrible. The desert was a chocolate mousse cake which had been frozen but tasted and appeared to be somewhat stale. This was a big disappointment and I doubt if I will be making the trip to Vincents (main restaurant or the Bistro) again any time in the future. There are many good restaurants here in the northern section of the area.",

I normally eat here for brunch or lunch, but was told that they extended their hours and offer dinner.   I've always hated their service here because it was always slow and pitiful, but this morning was an exception. Maybe it's because we were the only customers here at 8 in the morning, but our server was really attentive and friendly. Their menu hasn't changed very much and I ordered the crab quiche and hubby ordered the French toast. They always offer complimentary croissants which is always awesome and buttery and delicious! I decided to not even share my entree with my hubby and I ate my crab quiche - all of it all by myself!   When we were done, like I remember, they offer complimentary dessert which was a fruit tart with ice cream on top. Prices are extremely inexpensive too! For two entrees, complimentary croissants and complimentary desserts, we spent around $25. What great value!!!   I love it here and if you like French cuisine, I'm sure you will love it here too! I will definitely come back to dine for dinner.",

We are from France and haven't been able to go back in a while and this honestly brought us back to France with the flavors and dishes. The servers are very kind and loved talking with us, when he found out we were French he actually went and got the Chef to come talk to us because he is also French, he was such a nice man. I wish I could give more stars!! Just an overall great experience. Although it can get a bit pricy, the quality of the food makes you realize that does not matter. Amazing food full of flavor and great environment. We will definitely be coming back.",

We returned these two bowls even though we would like to have eaten them as well.  So the service sucked.  The pork loin followed and was excellent.",

When you walk in here, they give you free, homemade mini-croissants. Warm, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just perfect. No matter what you order the food is amazing. The 3 times I've been there I have never been disappointed. Can't wait to go back!   My favorite so far (aside from the mini croissants) have been the moules with fries. So delicious!   Pour le proprietaire du bistro, je vous ecris un petit morceau en francais. Merci beaucoup pour un excellent bistro francais en Arizona, et j'espere pouvoir visiter bientot. Felicitations !",

How many French people cook with ginger?  Duck ravioli was overpowered by ginger.  Also, it was a bit undercooked.  The entrees portions were small so overeating won't be a problem.  The seabass and the lamb were well prepared.  The coconut ganache was good.  If they had creme brulee on the menu, it would have been better.  The service was superb.

    "text": "Kind of hard to find, tucked away in a small courtyard type of place, behind it's big brother \"Vincent's\", the very first observation I had was the fact that they offered valet parking ($4+) even though all parking spots are no more than 30 feet from the entrance, and annoyingly enough, only a few spots are left open for people like me who prefer to park their own vehicle. The dining room is small, compact and quite \" bistroish\". My 3 guests ordered \"a la carte\" and I went the \"prix-fixe\" route. For $25. I had ravioli w/duck confit, lemon sole/sea bass, pear tarte. Each was acceptably tasty, very small portions, a good value in the True spirit of \" bistro\"....no culinary accomplishment mind you, but this is what one expects from a bistro. My guests choices were also acceptable, the service was efficient for the most part, although when I asked for a \"pastis, Pernod or even Ricard\" , the national French bistro apperitif, the waiter went blank, like he'd never even heard the words, a shortcoming in the context of this Bistro's identity. Their \"wine by the glass\" selection is also within what one should expect in a bistro with a fair pour at reasonable prices. None of us took much liking to the cheap quality paper napkins, even the most simple bistro in France offers linen napkins; then again, Maybe that's part of the equation in order to kep the prices down? A last note: the noise level is quite high, not a criticism really, it is what it is, just an observation.",

Frequented by more mature locals, it is quiet and composed, an excellent place for conversation. It's a little rustic and by no means formal; the service is inviting and just standoffish in southern French fashion. Best for smaller groups, no more than 4-6 people.  I've tried two dishes here, the Coq au Vin and the Salmon, and they both blow me away in terms of flavour. The portions are intelligently small, and each meal comes with some of the best mini-croissants I've ever tasted and a rotating dessert.   The only fault I can find are the prices; at $7-$10 a meal, I feel almost obliged to use the tip keep from feeling guilty. An absolute steal, hidden away.",

I've had their salads, coq au vin, burgundy beef, salmon, specials, desserts, and not a dog in the bunch.  Service has been spot on.  Every time.  The atmosphere is \"French country\" and very comfortable.   When the bill comes, it almost appears to missing a digit - it's very affordable.  The whole place exists for the sheer purpose of sharing the chef's delicious, beautifully-presented meals.      The main restaurant is there to really showcase the Chef's True talent and should not be missed.  It's a great value as well, but expect to pay for a real meal.  One last thing, during the cooler months, the parking lot at Vincent's (Cmbk, West of 40th St) is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up.  It's very comfortable with a European feel and usually well-attended.  It's a great way to taste some great food.",

    "text": "My mother loves French food. After reading nice Yelp reviews, I decided to take her here for her birthday dinner. I am very happy to have stumbled upon this treasure! We arrived on a Saturday at 5:45pm with no wait (but completely filled up shortly thereafter). We were immediately seated. Seating is offered inside or outside on a small patio. Dress is nicely casual. You can self-park or pay for a $4 valet in the same lot. The interior is decorated quaintly with a classic French bistro decor. It feels warm and cozy inside. As soon as we were seated we were greeted with ice water and a plate of small, warm, buttery croissants (complimentary). The menu is simple but with a nice selection to meet any taste you have for a meal.  Selections of beef, lamb, fish, crepes, et. were all available. For $13 you can order a special (choice of about 5 entrees) or for $25 you can order the prix fixe which is your choice (from 3 pre-selected) starter, entree and dessert. My mom ordered a shrimp crepe which was delicious. The sauce was decadently rich- real French food. I ordered one of their specials- a seafood skewer. My plate came with salad, roasted vegetables and the skewer. Everything was very fresh and cooked just right. My father was the only one of us who selected a prix fixe. He chose the mushroom ravioli, peppered steak, and bread pudding for dessert. We had a glass water bottle with deliciously fresh, cool water always on our table. We never ran out of warm croissants. I tried some of my dad's bread pudding and we all agreed it was the best we had ever tasted. All of the staff were exceptionally attentive, polite and helpful. Our waiter was wonderful. It was a very nice dinner and great choice for a birthday. We will certainly return.",

    "text": "One word...Amazing! My wife and I come to the Scottsdale often and finally found the little Gem in the desert we have been looking for. This place is a must. A regular menu is available but we ordered off the Prix Fix which let's you pick selections to make a 3 course meal for $25. You can't beat this deal for the quality. I had a Greek salad, rack of lamb and a fig tart. My wife chose a escargot spinach puff pastry, veal sweetbread and the cream cartolla (creme brulee). Everything was fabulous! The service was outstanding. The servers were showing us what other people were ordering to help us make a choice as we were looking over all the choices. They also gave us a little history lesson on the chef/owner and establishment. Junior was our waiter and we've never had better service. Very personable. Bottom line...we are making this a regular stop every time we are in town. This place is a quaint French style cuisine with a great ambiance. Great job, Vincent!",

I love the pull-apart croissants that they give you while you for your meal, and the Coq Au Vin is my favorite dish. My husband usually goes for the lamb shank and has never been disappointed. The service is friendly and quirky here, too, which I love. A much more relaxed environment from the fine dining room they share a kitchen with -- an environment I much prefer!",

I am happy to say that we have found our new favorite breakfast / brunch destination! Vincent's has the best brunch menu in all of the Valley--hands down.   We started with the four tiny croissants and jam that our friends had mentioned were so delicious (they were!). My boyfriend had the lobster quiche which arrived with a side of greens and I ordered the tomato, basil, and mozzarella omelette. We also shared cinnamon raison brioche which came to us warm, full of raisons, with a perfectly \"eggy\" taste. Everything was absolutely wonderful and our only concern was that we couldn't possibly finish everything they had brought!   The prices are considerably lower than what you'd expect to pay for such a delightful meal. :-)  My boyfriend commented that this is the best brunch spot he's found since he left New York.",

It's very quaint, they serve you warm, buttery homemade croissants with jam when you sit down, plus at the end of your meal, you get a complimentary dessert - which is different every time and is always delish. It keeps me coming back!  I've been here a few time for breakfast and lunch. I absolutely love their omelets - super fluffy! I've yet to find anything I love on their lunch menu, but nothing is bad either.   Next time I go, I hope to go for dinner and try their pizza.  I come here often with my boyfriend who loves the croissants and dessert too - but it's the perfect place for a lunch with your girlfriends.",

    "text": "We like to go our of our way to try and find F&B venues of all types; from the down and dirty, the hip and trendy, the cosy and quaint to the greasy and Pepto Bismally......  But I'm always intrigued when we arrive to a new town, to see where locals like to go and eat.. now usually, that really does mean a take out burger joint or a greasy spoon.  But in the case of the vast Phoenix sprawl with its inorganic population growth, (basically it's three major cities shoved into one) you've got an ever evolving diaspora of generational clusters with it's own microcosm of habitual norms...  The easiest way to observe the human condition is in it's eating habits; we had the pleasure of staying in the Scottsdale area this time, where an intimate little outpost of a Bistro bustles like a hive, hidden away from it's older, larger sibling, Vincent's on Camelback.  Click below to read more...  When you're on Camelback Rd, you likely to see Vincent's on Camelback first facing the street.  It's an older, established restaurant in Scottsdale which has slightly faded from the limelight, with a loyal following of astute and mature clientele who enjoy French Cuisine.    Veering right into the driveway, you're bound to think that you would be entering into the main building (there's really no defined indication on navigating this place) but Vincent's Market Bistro is actually a separate venue all together with it's own quaint casual identity.    Actually, it's a tricky venue, the awning and front foliage is the only indication of it's presence and with a side entrance, it's hard to see inside to confirm that it's open... But once inside, you see a whole different world...  It's by definition, a quintessential Bistro from Provence; Venetian plastered walls drenched in Sunflower Gold, color ridden tablecloths with Wooden chairs and mirrored ceiling with stencils and faux wood beams; this restaurant is the Disneyland of Bistro hodge podge...but I like it a lot!  What really got me at hello was the plate of home baked Croissants with Strawberry Jam delivered to our table; not entirely Bistro protocol, but at that point, who cared?  I mean, is there any wrong occasion for buttery Croissants?? It was devoured immediately, only to be refilled instantaneously, like a buttery Croissant Genie popped and gave us three wishes!!!  What was True to it essence was the menu: I found old favorites like Coq au Vin and Country Quiche.  And the price point was definitely not French!  The Coq au Vin was too irresistible to pass up, and when it came to our table, it delivered as promised; a wonderfully rich Bourgogne sauce covered Chicken leg on top of an equally decadent mound of Mashed Potatoes.  With portions that would satisfy the French diet, the rich dish sated our American belly...  And looking at the other tables, it seemed that it did equally well around the room...   And what would be a price fix course at Vincent's without our knowledge, a complimentary dessert arrived.  It was really cute actually, the whole experience-kinda felt transported into the surreal Hybrid of French American cuisine...  All in all, Vincent's is a great place for Lunch where you can escape the brutal Phoenix sun and stay, cool and relaxed in the French countryside for the afternoon.

They are very nice about it.  And they are free!  They have a daily lunch special board - it used to be $10 but when we went yesterday, the price has gone up to $13.  The entree's look small, but they actually filled me up.  I had the beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes.  It was good but got heavy towards the end, so I traded with my brother, he ordered the pesto pasta ($7) with and added chicken (+$2).  The pesto pasta was very light but almost a little too bland.  At the end, you also get a complimentary dessert.  Our dessert yesterday was a flourless chocolate brownie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It was so good!  That definitely made me super full.  I would come back again for lunch.  The place is small and quaint and the price may seem pricey for lunch, but the quality surpasses the price.",

The ambiance reminded me of time I've spent in France.  In my opinion, I believe this setting is the closest you can get to being in France in AZ.  I was impressed with the variety of food options at the market including paella, crepes, omelettes and pastries.  It is an intimate setting, so be prepared to share a table and meet new people if it is crowded.  I think this part reminded me of France as well.  :)  I will definitely be back!",

I ordered an asparagus quiche that was golden brown on top.   The eggs were done perfectly and I believe there were some sundried tomatoes in it. Accompanying it was a salad of tossed greens with light vinaigrette which was heavenly.  My brother ordered the cheese & fruit plate which he said was delicious.  The thin little slices of bread were toasted to perfection and he was pleased with the overall arrangement.  I wish we'd had time to come back for lunch or dinner but I was only here for 4 days working on assignment so it will have to wait for my next visit.",

    "text": "I read a lot of reviews for this place and I get a little perturbed. Slow service, overpriced, terrible wait staff...... When really people should be realizing this is not an American restaurant. This is a French bistro that happens to be in America. European style dining is extremely different than the American mentality of sit down, order your food, eat it and then leave. And if you want a larger menu, go to Denny's. No, no, no, my dear friend. Dining in Europe is an experience and one that is used to build relationships around the dinner table and to make memories. The service is slow for a reason. It will give you time to talk to each other. Enjoy the croissants. Look at the menu without having to tell the wait staff you need more time. This is closer to real customer service. When I come here, I know I need more time and I plan for it.  The food is exquisite. Perfect sized portions and perfect taste every time. I did not realize that I actually like butternut squash soup until I came here. Having brunch here is great also.  Each meal is finished off with more complimentary food. Whatever the kitchen decided to make that day for dessert with one scoop of refreshing ice cream.  If I were to give one criticism of this place it would be the parking. There is just not enough of it sometimes because the other foodies will agree that this place is worth it.",

The tables were a bit tight for crutches, but normally it is cozy and just the way we like it. Our server was great, the smoked salmon quesadilla and the lobster quiche were both divine, and of course we were pleasantly surprised by the sweet desserts that came after the meal. I don't know why we forgot about this place for a bit, but now it is on our radar again and we'll be back to Vincent's.",

I opted for a prixe fixe course and it was delicous.  Butternut squash soup, which was rich and creamy; the lamb was absolute perfection and delicious.  Pink in the middle, but seared perfectly on the outside. Lastly, the profiteroles were delicous. Overall this was an excellent restaurant that I will definitely visit many more times to come.",

Rich, sinful, oohhh....  Tomato and cheese salad also, very wonderful. The olive oil was the best I have ever tasted.   I had the lamb shank, and it was cooked perfectly, the potatoes were good, but the sauce threw me a little, I don't know how or why, but it was like the same smell as spaghetti-Os sauce!! haha! I know it obviously was not, but that is how my brain registered it.   My older Sis had the duck with bacon lentils, she was in heaven.  My younger Sis had the Pizza/Tarte with bacon, thyme and onions, it was very very very good.  I would go back for that and the bisque and the salad.    The deserts were good, not great, but a nice sweet way to end our meal.  I liked the peach tart.  The service was some of the best as well, honestly, they made our meal more enjoyable.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what the fuss is about.....especially an overall rating of 4.5. The coffee's good (which is why they get 2 stars). Service is okay and the ambiance isn't quaint when cleanliness is questionable. I stopped by for a weekday breakfast and there were not any patrons in the bistro. I sat myself and ordered off a very limited weekday/breakfast menu. The mini croissants and jam were oily and not airy or light - obviously the result of a microwave. I ordered the \"build your own\" omelet. Looks good on paper but had to be sent back due to the absent Gruyere cheese. Should of just kept the original one since the added Gruyere did not change what would and did prove to be a very blah entree. The bacon was okay but definitely reheated. There is nothing French about this place - the French cook with fresh and tasteful ingredients.....maybe their dinner menu is better.",

    "text": "This is one of our favorite little spots, and have been coming here for years. You can't beat Vincent's lovely French fare at these prices. The menu has some regular items (the curly endive salad with bacon and mustard dressing is among my favorite salads in the world!); the shrimp crepe and lamp shank are both to-die-for! The souffles for dessert are spectacular. But the best thing about Vincent's Bistro is Scott... Our favorite server. He has been there for years, and treats his customers like family. You will not be disappointed at Vincent's Market Bistro -- if we have a celebration, this is where we come. So should you! If you come early and the place is packed (often the case on a Saturday evening) just meander over to the bar at Vincent's (the two restaurants are adjoined and share a kitchen) -- it's not so bad to enjoy a drink at Vincent's \"proper\" while you wait for a table at the Bistro. Best of both worlds! We have even seen Sandra Day O'Connor and the late Muhammed Ali dining at the Bistro... It's clearly enjoyed by the famous AND the \"regulars people\" - LOL. And this is NOT a pricey place. Vincent's is a big more high-brow, but the Bistro is less expensive, and has a casual French feel to it. Kid friendly too (if your kids are adventuresome eaters like ours) but no kid menu, per se.  Generally an older crowd, and while not a boisterous place, it's small/intimate so it can get a little loud. But we LOVE it, and can't recommend it enough! Ask for Scott -- tell him Cara and Mike sent you!",

Horrible service, only about 6 people in the whole place and took 30 minutes to get the cheese plate and panini. Lackluster interior, just yuck.",

Last night I had duck confit with lentils and vegetables. it isn't a lot of food - but it tasted delicious. Portions are reasonable sized - not huge serving of mediocre food. Service was EXCELLENT - wish I was good at names - he was great. And then we got complimentary dessert - small piece of cake/brownie with one scoop of ice cream - delicious. Great coffee. The duck (with dessert) was $16 -  not cheap, but worth it.  Ambience is a little contradictory - sort of outdoor (although it is indoor), bright tablecloths, tables that are not that big. I've never been to France, but I'm guessing like (supposed to be like) a French outdoor cafe. The tables are pretty close together. Still, nice ambience.   Service and food are the stars - as they should be. I really should try to get there more often.",
