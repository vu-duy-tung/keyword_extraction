It was a Friday night and I was surprised to see only a fee people in there but was so happy to see that it wasn't packed. The place was very clean and had graffiti art on the walls while music was playing. You walk up to where you order your pizza and the place is like a subway/chipotle; you tell them what to put on it and see what they put on your pizza. Thought this was cool. They brought our pizzas to us and I thought it tasted good I just wasn't a fan of the bunt edges but that's the draw back from having it cooked open flamed. The pookie ice cream/ cookie was very good; caution it's served in a very hot bowl lol learned that after touching it. Thought the lady should have told me this when she brought it to us. I would good here again because you can't beat the price! Also my husband was glad they serve alcohol lol",

They employees move you in and out as fast as possible but most people there are ordering for multiple people (office buildings and such). The ONE down fall I have with this place is they put waaaaaaaay too much dressing on their salads. I've learned to ask for it on the side but on occasion they forget and toss it for me. Not a deal breaker but still a little frustrating at times.   The pizza is amazing and the prices are too.",

Don't let long lines fool you as they are very fast at making your favorite pizza or salad. The pizza is delicious - fresh as it comes with the perfect crust. The price is not that bad either, especially for the amount of food you get. Pizzas are decent sized and are just under $8. Plus they have a great selection of China Mist iced teas...my favorite! Salads are also fantastic.  I want one opened by my house now...although that could be trouble. The staff has never been anything but great to me so I'm not sure what the bad reviews are about.",

The concept is great - unlimited toppings for one low price - but, though this place has a lot of toppings, they don't have all of my favorites and the toppings they do offer aren't of the highest quality. I wish they had ricotta or goat cheese. I wish they had more fresh vegetables... even their spinach was already cooked which lead to less than a great flavor.   Here is the pizza I ordered:   tomato and pesto sauces, mozz cheese (shredded and fresh), spicy sausage, bacon (not cut well, with large chunks that were hard to chew), spinach, onion, peppers, garlic, tomato, and basil.   I was impressed with their crispy crust and the pizza had decent flavor on day one.  The real disappointment was with the leftovers. There's no way I could eat this whole pizza in one sitting, so I had half a pizza left. The reheated leftovers tasted terrible... the cheese got that weird plasticky quality and it just tasted awful... only one day later. That would be my biggest deterrence to a return visit. While this place is alright, I don't think I will be back anytime soon.",

Always comes out really great (for the price). I just think its the best pizza money can but under $10.   Throw in some draft beers and amazing ice cream shakes and its a winner in my book.",

This location gets pretty busy during the week at lunchtime but the staff is fairly efficient and can get your food done quickly.  Highly recommend",

They make your order in waves: first the crust (reg or gluten-free), cheese and sauce, meats, and then vegetables and herbs. It went quickly and it only needs a few minutes in the oven to bake. I got tomato sauce, mozzarella, and red onions, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, jalapenos, artichokes and spinach. I do wish it was fresh spinach instead of cooked. It was delicious! Thin, crispy crust and the rest was soft. I'm excited for my leftovers. The salads looked really good and they even have a pookie (pizza cookie) dessert. Yum!",

I love the pizza because I can choose whatever ingredients I like. Service is friendly and well paced. They get rush hour like at noon and they get huge lines all the way to the door, however, no worries, they are very fast and you will get your pizza in no time.  My pizza was a little burnt at a couple of spots on top, but nothing major. Overall really good.  Oh, and I love the teas, they black, green and jasmine, passion fruit, and a watermelon option, they are so yummy you don't even need to put sugar on them.",

    "text": "They use fresh ingredients when preparing your pizza. You can pick and choose your ingredients when building your pizza or add unto their already popular creations. The pizza crust is perfectly made in regards to flavor and thinness, not at all chewy and not too crispy like a cracker.   I had the pesto chicken with some add on ingredients: garlic, mushrooms, spinach, and spicy sausage. The mozzarella cheese is fresh and not stringy or spongy.   From my first bite to the very last, I was in heaven. Delightful, all the different textures and flavors intermingling with one another on that amazing crust.   The closest comparison in terms of taste and freshness is Papa Murphy's. However, the crust is phenomenal and not comparable to any other that I have had thus far. Firedpie keeps it simple but blows the competition away with its unique sauces and pizza crust.   The customer service at the 3110 Central Ave. location was fast and friendly. The dining area was comfortable and had its own self-service condiment and beverage section.   All in all, a great experience.",

Today I decided I would just asked for a little bit of red onion on it. I was charged $9 because they considered that a custom salad. When it was brought up to her attention at the register, I was told that it's not their choice and that they had to charge me $2 extra for 7 slivers of red onion. She is lucky I didn't ask her to take it off truthfully. I don't see me going there anytime soon. I can get a small handful of red onions added onto a basic caesar salad elsewhere and not be charged $2 extra.",

    "text": "Great place overall.  It's hard to go to a pizza shop when I'm eating alone (usually $20, 3000+ calories), but they have a good system in place.  Tons of space inside.  Very easy parking.  It's in the center where you'll find Starbucks, The Good Egg, etc.  To be honest I was going to the Good Egg and saw your sign and realized you were one of my bookmarks.  The restaurant can't be seen from the street or even the parking lot.  I'm glad I changed my mind and went here.  The service was very friendly from all of the staff.  The pizza was $7.95 and it's more than enough for one person.  It could feed two and it's a great price if you choose that route.  I'll take my nieces here and have them split one and feed 2 hungry kids for $4 each plus drinks.  I ordered the Meaty Italian (pic enclosed).  I ordered, got my drink, went to the little island to grab some parm and peppers, say down, took out my tablet, and by then the pizza was ready.  Probably under 5 minutes.  Very fresh and hard to believe it was that fast.  Despite the low price they offered to put anything else on it that I wanted so I chose the sweet peppers.  Same price, which is nice because I hate it when you order a pizza and the toppings double the price.  The place was clean, they serve fountain drinks so you can refill, and the decor was modern.  If you want to grab a pizza and not break the bank and maybe get 2 meals out of it, check out this place.",

Things I loved: easy to read menu, variety of toppings, ease of ordering & check out, and the pizza of course! Perfect size too!  Things I didn't love: no vegan cheese, tad unevenly cooked pizza (one side was pretty burnt & crunchy), also unkept dining room.   One factor that makes me prefer their competitor, my pie, is that they not only have vegan cheese, but have a vegan pizza on their menu!  Also they have wheat crust which is an added bonus.",

The staff greeted us warmly the second we walked in and helped us place our order and held our dessert order until we were ready.  I had the Pesto Chicken pizza and he had the Meaty Italian. Each was ~$8 each and could easily have been shared with a side salad instead of ordering two pizzas. Pizzas here are all made with 11\" crusts.  The fire grill flavor was great! The pizza crust was thin and crispy, but not crunchy or cardboard like at all.  The pesto sauce was excellent and the meat pizza was exactly what you would expect it to be and they were happy to put pepperoni on only one side since I don't love pepperoni and wanted to try his pizza.    We finished it off with the Pookie (pizza cookie - if you've been to BJ's think Pzookie) which had a full side scoop of ice cream for just $3. Delish and cooked only when we asked for it so the cookie part was nice and hot to melt the ice cream.  Overall: A We will definitely be back.",

The only con in my opinion is that the employees did not ask me if I had been there before. So I was a little confused right off the bat. They kind of just stood there waiting for me to talk. I had to say \"Ok so this is my first time here, what do I start with??\"   Overall, awesome experience for some awesome food within minutes!",

I have been to Fired Pie twice so far. One time I got a Tomato Basil pizza and the other time a Cheese Pizza.   Given my past experiences with pizza factories, I can say that the pizza here tastes off. I think the problem is the dough which has a wet and soggy look and texture. It could be an indication that it is frozen dough. Additionally, I don't like how they put basil on the pizza after it has been cooked. They should soak the basil in water in those containers and put it on the pizza before it is cooked, so it gets cooked into the pizza - it tastes way better that way. And actually they don't season the pizza at all before it is being cooked. No salt, pepper, oregeno, nothing - they make you put that on after it is cooked. And it doesn't taste the same.  There is a lot of disorganization behind the counter. They start making your pizza but forget whose pizza is whose toward the end of the line - happened on both occasions, and I almost ended up with the wrong pizza the first time. And it wasn't even busy.",

Second, food is all about flavor, and because the sauce at Fired Pie has no flavor it kills the whole pizza (just like MOD Pizza).   It's a good deal: I walked by a guy eating a pizza that was so loaded with toppings there's no way they made any money on this guy; I guess it evens itself out.   Rarely am I able to point in the direction of someone doing the exact same thing better but in this case Fired Pie executives should eat a pizza at Pizza Sudio. It's the same pizza, same deal, only with flavor.   Looks are important but in food, but not as much as flavor.   Fried Pie, indeed.",

Pick a sauce (pesto, marinara, alfredo, buffalo), pick your cheeses (mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, feta, blue cheese, etc.), pick your meats (pepperoni, meatball, Italian sausage, spicy sausage, and bacon, just to name a few).  Then, pick your veggie toppings.  I had sun-dried tomatoes, sauteed spinach, garlic, sauteed mushrooms, and artichoke hearts).  You can get any and all of the toppings you want or you can get one of the pizzas on the menu.  Regardless of which pizza you get or how many toppings you add, it's the same price...$7.95.  Not only was my pizza amazing because I created it, the toppings are high-quality and the thin crust is amazing!  Great food, great prices, and great concept!",

Staff was very friendly, though towards the end of my visit they got a little too distracted with training a new employee and sort of ignored serving new customers promptly.

The pizza was pretty good quality wise, everything looked and tasted pretty good. Don't expect top notch gourmet pizzas here, something about the pizzas remind me of Pizza Hut to be honest. But for the price and convince of making a super good pizza for myself, I'll take it.

Close to home so stopped in last night for take-out.  It doesn't take long for the pizza to cook (thin, crispy crust).  My pesto chicken pizza was excellent.  Hubs steak and blue pizza rocked as well.  We shared a steak and blue salad with balsamic dressing and it was also very good.

I decided to go with the Hawaiian BBQ pizza since this is a trial basis and I didn't want to ''Emeril' my pizza by 'bamming' just any ingredients on it.  I got my drink, sat down and a few minutes later the pizza arrived.  The first bite was tasty with the BBQ sauce somewhat overpowering everything else. The tartness of the pineapple and the bacon's savoriness followed through but a bit understated though. The crust was good while it's still warm but as it got cold it sort of became like toasted saltine crackers in taste and texture.  A thicker crust would probably have made a difference but it's not my concept.   Overall, it's a good experience and worth coming back.",

The format of the restaurant is Chipotle style, where they build the pizza for you while you're in line, and then bake it. The food is fast, delicious, and a good value. I am somewhat of a NY pizza snob, and still thoroughly enjoyed this place.",

The staffed seemed nice, they were very busy as it is during the lunch rush (1130am). Polite and quick paced, so if you are on the go this would be a great place to eat. The reason for the 4 stars is because the person on the pepperoni station put frozen pepperoni on my salad and another person down the line (they work in an assembly like kind of like Chipotle) had to take them off and put them in the oven for me. Thank you for whoever you are man. But needless to say, my salad tastes awesome and very filling! Can't wait to try the pizza. Dining in was good too.

I decided to customize mine:  Pick your sauce: Tomato Cheese: Mozzarella and Gorgonzola Meats: Pepperoni, Spicy Sausage, and Bacon Vegetables: Mushrooms, Spinach, Artichokes, and Jalapenos  They tell me it will take 3 minutes and voila! Two pizzas with a bunch of freaken toppings came out to be less than $20! What???!  There has to be a catch, right? Like, the food sucks or something...  We sit down and my pizza was delicious!!!! The crust was thin and it was so fresh! I even had to get a to-go box (I still had three slices left). Now, that's value! I am kind of scared to come around during lunch peak hours though. I am sure this place gets packed! I am definitely a fan!",

The size was plentiful as we all had left overs (which we plan to heat up for lunch tomorrow).  A pizza and drink was about $10, but considering that we will get two meals out of it, it's a great value to us.  It was walking distance from our hotel (Hilton Suites) so we didn't have to deal with parking. But we saw plenty of parking on a Sunday night. It's a bit tricky to find as they are kind of tucked away behind The Good Egg and Jimmy John's.",

I swear these guys stole this idea from Kramer, who wanted to open a restaurant where people could make their own pie, but whatever, I'm not complaining.  It actually works.  I was trying to think of a reason why Fired Pie shouldn't receive 5-stars, but I couldn't come up with anything.  The process is relatively quick and painless and your pizza is ready within a few minutes.  For about $8.50 (with tax), this pizza is awesome.  In fact, the quality and taste is almost equal to popular establishments like Pomo Pizzeria, Cibo, and Federal Pizza.  I absolutely love the fact that I can design whatever pizza I want and add extra toppings for no additional fee.  If you want a quick, affordable, delicious experience, I highly recommend Fired Pie to sate your hunger for pizza.",

They are, of course wood fired, as the name suggests, so the crust is delicious. I've done pesto and red sauce as a base and then I load my pie up with all of my favorite toppings. Chicken, meatball, fresh mozzarella, artichokes, Sun dried tomatoes, peppers, kalamata olives, fresh garlic.... I could go on and on. Their salads are also wonderful! There is a choice of romaine, spring mix, iceberg and other lettuce which is nice, add your favorite toppings and they will toss the dressing on it for you if you want. The chipotle ranch is my favorite. I love the salads as much as the pizza! This place is great, only thing is that it gets VERY busy during lunch time. I always show up around 11 to avoid a long line. Problem solved!",

You can choose your pizza toppings all for $7.95 per pizza. My hubby got one, I got one and our kids split one. They were even accommodating for putting certain toppings on only half for the kids.  They had juice boxes and milk for the kids and soda/iced tea for adults. My hubby and I tried both the mango and passion fruit iced teas. Both were yummy!

    "text": "The quality of the food has slipped enough that I almost don't care what's happened with the service. Almost. I care enough to update my review.  I went on a Saturday for lunch. Restaurant was almost empty except for the 30-something man ahead of me in line, who was an object of fascination to the 40-something female clerk working the ingredients line. Maybe his daily visits are the highlight of her lonely existence. Maybe he's Clark Kent. Maybe they dated, back when she was a wealthy socialite, but he won't recognize her existence now that she's reduced to making personal pizzas. Maybe she was his nanny and hopes he'll recognize her. Maybe he's an eligible bachelor who has promised to marry the woman who makes him a perfect pizza.  Certainly, she was trying to make him the perfect pizza. She lavished ingredients on his pizza while picking pieces off mine to make sure I didn't get one single extra piece of sausage. Not one! Gotta protect those profit margins! The result is that I've had $1 frozen personal pizzas with more generous topping distribution. (And yet, the resulting pizza was still greasy, underdone at the middle, and burnt at the edges.)  I'd been planning to order a glass of wine, but I figured with the care taken to not overload my pizza, the restaurant's margins were already well-protected. I'd also planned to tip, but by the time the clerk cooed Mr. Wonderful's name to call his order but snarled mine impatiently because I wasn't lingering by the counter but had gone to get a table, that also was a non-starter.  The whole time, the young female manager was training another staff member within earshot but was apparently okay with it all.  I'm clean, quiet, modestly dressed, and prepared to tip. I have all my teeth, no running sores, and nothing that suggests infectious disease. If I'm by myself, I aim for hours when the restaurant isn't busy, so that I'm not taking up a two-top that's in demand for parties of two (or, worse, a four-top in demand for parties of four). I'm getting really tired of condescending, judgmental clerks for whom even that's not good enough. Y'all are waitstaff at middle-class restaurants, so you have NOTHING to be snobby about.",

They have a great selection of toppings, so you can get pretty creative with your food.  I usually split a pizza and salad with my friends, since it's plenty for two. The last time I came I had the veggie pizza that they have listed on their menu, which was good but I prefer to create my own. You can't complain with the prices either, especially considering the fresh ingredients that they provide. Good customer service. Only complain is that the line can move slow if you go during the lunch time rush...but it's to be expected considering they make it as you come. Overall yummy pizza!",

    "text": "First time at Fired Pie today. Met my daughter for lunch. We arrived at 2:00 PM on a Monday and there were about 8 other tables. Good sign to be this busy after the lunch rush.   I ordered a pie with tomato sauce and pesto, mozzarella and fontina cheeses, pepperoni and spicy sausage, jalapenos and onions. Forgot to get fresh basil on top. My daughter ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes.   The line moved very quickly so we built, paid and filled our drinks within seven minutes. The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.   I'm not a thin crust guy. Never liked it, never will. I don't like deep dish either. I prefer regular, Hungry Howie's-type crust but thin is all they offer at Fired Pie.  We ate here because I just got laid off and I wanted a cheap meal for our weekly dad/daughter date. All their build-a-pizzas are $7.95.   Wow, I found a thin crust that I love!  It wasn't \"cracker crisp\" like I've seen at other places, thank goodness. It was cooked perfectly. The sauce-to-crust ratio was spot on. The toppings were toasted and flavorful. You guys nailed it!    Came home tonight and told my wife all about it and she wants in on the pie!  Our other daughter, who has celiac disease, can't eat here. Even tho they have gluten free dough, they prep it on the same boards and cook it in the same ovens, which is bad for celiac sufferers.",

I spent a month in Italy few years back and I had pizza in Naples and other cities and I have to say this pizza was better! It was cooked to perfection, I love thin crust.  The employees were awesome, so friendly, even delivered my pie to my table..it was my first time here so I wasn't sure what the procedure was.

A couple of days later I received an email from one of the founders (Fred Morgan) who had offered to replace my pizza. He asked for my address and sure enough he was True to his word and sent me a gift card for another pizza.   The pizza was really good. You can tell that these guys have been in the pizza industry for a long time. Their pies are about the same size as you would get at California Pizza Kitchen, but you get to add your toppings similarly to how you would at subway or at Chipotle.  Also seeing the way that they responded to my earlier posting shows that they understand the importance of client promoters and detractors which in my opinion is a sign of a great company.   Thank you Fred!",

I decided to choose a red sauce, a couple of cheeses (because I can), pepperoni and bacon (I said because I can!!) And finally pepperoncinis and pinapple (shhh...because I can). They fired it in the oven and I waited like five minutes. Then I had a personal pizza. What made my day was seeing a stack of half pizza boxes for people's left overs. I didn't use one. I ate the entire delicious pie (because I can) My only complaint was the selection of toppings. Not that there weren't enough mind you and not that there were too many. It was that you have other people ordering in front of you. Now you have to wait for them to decide whether to put sausage or spicy sausage on their pesto pizza or if they should get grilled onions. Come on lady, my pizza is done and ready to get cooking. Move!!! Get out the way!!! (BECAUSE I CAN!!!)",

The pizzas are ample for one person or could be split if you also got a saled (which is huge). Everything looks and tastes fresh and I love that you can ask to have as much as you want piled on and it's still the same price. Although the line can back up at lunch (much like a Chipotle) since everything is made to order, the pizza is done in 3 minutes after being cooked in a hig-powered 550 degree oven. I don't think I've even had a problme finding any seatign even when the line is long. I actually think this pizza is better than 90% of pizza I've had elsewhere. To me, it's worthy of 5 starts. I just wish they had one right where I live.",

Most pizza places would charge you for each add'l topping...NOT here! So I usually add on artichoke hearts, feta cheese, roasted peppers, spinach & garlic!  How can you beat that! I usually go after the big lunch rush, usually like 4 pm, otherwise expect to wait in line at the peak of the lunch rush during the week, but the line does go pretty fast. I like that they are even open til 8 pm, M-F, and even til 4 pm Sat & Sun!.... In a way, it's kind of their advantage to stay open later like that, as people get off work in the nearby area & they can swing in their to get a pizza or salad!  On the counter, they have parm cheese, & red pepper flakes to sprinkle on your pizza, but they also have garlic powder, & Italian Seasonings, too!    Before this place opened, I would usually go to the nearby Z-Pizza on Thomas, but no more!",

You can buy one of their pre-made pizzas, or create your own. No extra charges for ANYTHING.  They really mean it when they say create your pizza. Sauces include tomato, bbq, pesto, alfredo and more.  On my last pizza, I asked for mozerella AND fresh mozerella. I asked for the oil and garlic over the cheese (before the toppings). The meat went on next (pepperoni, bacon, sausage) following by the vegies (roast peppers, fresh red onion, roast mushrooms, pepperoncini, heavy garlic). When the pizza came out of the oven, the chopped basil went on.  I asked for a side of sauce to go with it. The guy suggested ranch, but I went for tomato sauce.  The crust was crisp but soft. The topping were fresh and tasty. VERY fast and very reasonable pricing.",

This is not the first time I have seen this happen here at the specific location! The good thing was the this young gentleman actually did try and settle the situation the best he could but the young ladies still proceeded on and went outside to argue and put their hands on one other. I was appalled I could not believe my eyes now that I've seen this and know what kind of location it is (unmanageable )I do not know who the manager is (he/she was not present)  but they do need to get on these young ladies and teach them how to be proper or simply not allow it again and not to mix personal situations with work. I am no longer going to be at this location, it is unfortunate for me that I have to go out of my way just to be able to enjoy my lunch break, when I have been going there for quite sometime.  If it hadn't been for that young gentlemen (who's name I cannot remember)  I would have called the police.  The food is great but it is a shame this is how this store is being managed!  Never have I seen such behavior.  Need to make much needed improvements or this location will continue to lose their customers.",

The Steak and Blue pizza intrigued me, so ordered it. The dough was brushed with oil and then it was topped with garlic, mozzarella, gorgonzola, sliced steak, mushrooms and roasted peppers and onions  I asked for artichoke hearts, additionally. About 8 minutes later my masterpiece was baked to perfection! This was the best pizza,  although certainly the most non-conformist, that I have eaten in ages! I would return for this pizza, though I'm fantasizing about the combinations I can create, all for $7.75 each!",

    "text": "I am sitting in the joint as I type.  It's a great little shop.  Great concept - make your own pizza, thin crust, fired in the oven in front of you.  I have never had an issue with service.  All of the employees are nice, young folks who do a good job at getting your food to you AND trying to keep the place nice and tidy.  They get SLAMMED at lunch but as soon as it calms a bit, they switch gears and wipes down all the tables, doors, glass, counters, their food prep area thoroughly, etc.  I for one, appreciate this quite a bit!  THANK YOU so much for having MULTIPLE flavored but unsweetened teas!  I hate going out and having only soda (we don't all drink it...) and beer (ugh) to choose from.  My husband is a huge tea drinker and hates that 90% of places barely toss a generic Lipton black iced tea out as an after-thought.  They have four flavors of brewed China Mist, including Watermelon Marula, Blackberry Jasmine, Passion Fruit and Traditional Black Tea.  And if you DID want a beer, wine, lemonade or soda, they have those too (a very limited selection of beer and wine but its something).  After reading some of the critical reviews, I will agree that they can tighten things up to make it even better.  However, they are doing it well enough that now we are just making incremental improvements not fixing something that is broken in any way.  1. Better organization during the assembly process. 2. Better timing so multiple pizzas may be placed into the oven at once 3. Sharper timekeeping to reduce the variable in crust doneness (today was the first time mine was somewhat overdone for my liking) 4. Have a separate set of veggie bins for vegans/vegetarians and/or those with food allergies.  Have a scoop/tong in each container to limit cross-contamination.  Have a box of gloves dedicated to this station and switch before touching anything in that area.  Place a BIG sign up asking that people announce any special dietary needs BEFORE they order. 5. Have more food handling training time for newbies.  About the 3rd time I visited, the (obvious) new guy grabbed the refill bag for the fresh garden salad...and placed the bag INTO the drawer that holds the food to open it. O_o  Thankfully, before *I* started in on him, his coworker caught him, fussed, had to clean the entire drawer out (good girl...) and then show him how to properly fill it.  Sadly, these things are NOT common sense to all...  Again, even the items above and nearly splitting hairs.  My family and I love this little joint and while some can do the 11\" pizza as a single serving, my husband and two little daughters can split the pizza and a salad between the four of us for dinner.  Which makes for a SUPER cheap, super yum yum meal with ZERO clean-up on my part!  Keep it fired up!",

Today I was served a burned pizza and when I pointed it out I was met with annoyance. The guy did say he would remake my pizza; however, on the remake I asked for more cheese because there was so little and the guy literally grabbed 2 more shredded pieces of mozzarella and said that's all he could do. I pointed out to him that they burned my previous pizza, that I frequent that store, so I know that is not the case,  and I would like it made with the same amount of ingredients as the original pizza the other employee made me. He did add a little more, but the rest of the pizza making process continued like this (may I have more peppers, may I have more onions)! As you can see I don't load my pizza up, but I do expect every bite to include all ingredients, which is what every pizza place should strive for. I will have to rethink my pizza choices, as there are so many options in Phoenix and I refuse to be treated poorly.",

I always order 3 pizzas, one heavy on their wonderful selection of veggies, one heavy in tasty meats, and then a final braver one using their other sauce options.   I should mention that even their salads have unlimited toppings so you can be as health conscious or unconscious as you want!

You just need to know one tip: Either order one of the specialties, or Order like a million toppings like everyone else does, since if you ask for just one or two, it will still be used rather sparingly.

    "text": "Typing this review as I eat.. i have eaten at other fired pie restaurants without issue but today for some reason I ordered a build your own pizza and as I was ordering I was telling the employee making my pizza what I wanted on it. Pepperoni, ham, bacon, steak, and buffalo chicken. I'm a bigger guy which is why I add on toppings to my pizzas. Again never had an issue but this time I noticed that employee kinda skimped on the buffalo chicken I asked her politely if she can add more buffalo chicken to which her reply was very condescending and rude she stated and with disgust in her face \"sorry I can't we have to portion out the meats for other customers\" I was shocked because this was a \"build your own pizza\" and from my understanding can build it the way I want. NEVER have I had this issue at ANY other fired pie in the valley and have always had toppings put on my pizza as much or as little as I wanted even during a lunch rush. Never bringing my money to this fired pie or any other fired pie ever, Pieology has a better bang for your buck and they have no problem putting as many toppings on a pizza..",

Fresh toppings, flavorful crust, with just a little bit of burnt crispiness that you expect with fire pizza, just the right amount. Not to mention for two people, (two pizzas & two drinks) it was under $20 and we had tons of leftovers.",

But today as I made a stop not too long ago with husband and daughter, we noticed a costumer \"complaining \" for nothing, my husband and I thought how rude and ungrateful the customer was being to those workers, he was basically complaining for getting fast and great service, and he was also refusing to hear the workers claim, we were sitting not too far from them, out of no where he started raising his voice at two young ladies who were just trying to do their best job and give him the best customer service in a polite way, it's sad to see a person like him be rude and deny the service they were trying to  give him. Don't  let a person who was just having a rough day try to let others know his \"complaints\" Park Central team members are always giving their best to us, the customers and give us our desires!  In other words, this store has always had an amazing customer service and always polite and positive towards us. People have to start complimenting them for their hard work they do.",

Very nice concept and hard to go wrong when you can see and choose what you want. The service is good and the pizza crust as well. We took an Italian salad as an entree and it was apparently a one person portion but easily fed two. I would have honestly never had gone had she not heard about it and hopefully when it's a little more lively and more recognized it can get a bit more street cred and busier (I'm one who favors a good lively restaurant atmosphere as long as you can talk to each other.",

    "text": "A co-worker told my wife about the new pizza place at Park Central and I knew we had to go.  We went in at 6 PM and were the only customers, although a few people trickled in after us. Park Central is vacant after 5PM, so that wasn't surprising. There was another Italian place here years ago, but I can't recall the name offhand.  The first thing that catches your eye is the pizza oven, with a raging fire inside. The pizza is about 12\" in diameter, just right for one hungry person. The ingredients are all in front of you, much like the counter at Subway, and they build your pizza as you watch (or salad, which my wife had). You can create your own pizza from a variety of sauces and cheeses, and an assortment of meats and veggies, or, order off their menu. I ordered off the menu and had the meaty Italian. Sauce, cheese, toppings, and a minute or two later it's in the oven. My wife ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad, but began customizing as it was assembled, \"no, leave off the onions and peppers. Can I have balsamic instead of the southwest dressing?\"  We sat down and they brought my pizza out a few minutes later. It was piping hot, with just the right amount of char on the bottom of the very thin crust. The sauce, cheese, and toppings were all great and worked well together. I finished it quickly! My wife enjoyed her salad, but wasn't very hungry after a big lunch, so she took most of it home and is going to have it for lunch today.  They are not yet serving beer and wine, which was the only disappointment on our visit, but they told us the City permits are taking longer than expected. I'll be back for vino.  Pino's on Thomas is within slingshot distance of Fired Pie. They've been serving great pizza for a long time, so it takes balls to open another pizza place this close to Pino's. They can definitely give Pino's a run for its money!  Salads and pizzas are both priced at $7.75.",

I had spicy sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and extra fresh garlic. No problem or charge if you want extra cheese or toppings.  The crust is wonderfully thin but crispy on the edges; the exemplar of a very fine pie IMO and unlike some places, not one spot of the pie was undercooked. Spinach and mushrooms are yummily marinated and spicy sausage was perfect. The fresh garlic adds a surprising, but very welcome bite.  Salads are the same price roughly and are substantially filling. This is no skimpy dinner salad!  The only drawback is that the line can be out the door at lunch; a testament to how good the pies are. I highly recommend going at off times if possible, but go regardless. All other pies I have tried recently cannot stack up for the value.",

The location is in a unique area with a beautiful courtyard (if you walk around the area, you'll see some awesome cacti) and plenty of parking (at least that was the case on a Saturday).   I had the spring mix salad with roasted veggies. The roasted veggies had no crispness to them. If you like your veggies soggy, you'll like these. For me, leaving the soggy veggies off would have made it a better salad. The salad was huge, though, and it ended up being passed around our table but evidently was thrown away. I did have a slice of the Hawaiian pizza from another member of my party and that was ok, but not anything special, more like a frozen pizza from a grocery store.",

    "text": "If you're a fan of make-your-own-pizza shops, you'll like Fired Pie.  You can choose from multiple different crusts and fit as many vegetables and additional toppings as possible on your pizza.  Prices are cheap, and food came out quickly.  Remember back in the day when you'd get a personal pizza from Pizza Hut?  Fired Pie is a customizable, slightly larger and definitely fancier version of that.  I ended up splitting a pizza (we jazzed up one of the menu items to make a supreme-style mishmash) and the buffalo chicken caesar salad.  The salad was good - nothing fancy - and the chefs warmed up the buffalo chicken for me, which was a very nice touch.  I wasn't entirely impressed with the pizza; there's a chance that our flavor combination wasn't great, though, and that's not the restaurant's fault.  One thing Fired Pie could improve on - wine selection.  When we went, they were entirely out of all red wine and only had some small theater-style bottles of one variety of white (and who wants white wine with their pepperoni pizza?).  There's tons of excellent pizza restaurants in the Valley, so the additional cocktails and wine options really help determine whether we'll be back again or not.  That said, this restaurant seems like it caters more to the busy business lunch crowd.  It's more of a fast-food restaurant than a sit-down place.  Fine for a quick bite, but I probably won't go out of my way to come back.",

The next morning, i contacted Uber Eats who told me the restaurant cancelled the order.  Not even Uber knew why. No call to let me know - nothing. So, food rating - unknown.

The pizza in the picture I have attached has a protein substitute and it tastes amazing. This is something that no other pizza place offers in terms of meat substitutes for vegetarians and vegans. The cost is reasonable and it's a very short wait while they cook your pizza. I definitely recommend this place and I will eat there again whenever I am in Arizona.",

I ordered some carryout pizzas and did not have any issues. We enjoyed the pizzas we got and it was a quick and easy in and out kind of deal. I do enjoy the fact that you get to build your own pizza and you don't get nickel'd and dime'd for every topping.",

I can't even remember what else. They aren't stingy either. I was shocked the thin crust could support so many toppings. I was a happy camper.",

I asked for extra dressing on the side, but the kid helping me barely put any in the clear plastic cup, which felt like it was being rationed, but I made it work in the end.  Cons: The pizza was of the taste and caliber of a frozen pizza from Safeway. Truly, not trying to \"dis\" this place, but it wasn't very good. In fact, I have had better frozen pizza and for a lot less money. Pizza to me, is the kind you get from a place like NYPD. Big, New York style pizza. This place just isn't in the same league. Also, I'm not a Pepsi fan by any means. Diet Coke would have hit the spot, but Diet Pepsi blows. The food not being that great, coupled with the price being too high for what you get, this isn't a place I will recommend or return to in the future, but to each their own.",

The staff was extremely friendly, and so willing to walk me through their process.  I got nervous when my pizza was ready so fast...my first thought is that the ingredients would not be cooked well enough to mesh....once again, thankfully, I was wrong.

    "text": "Love! I'm enjoying this trend of Chipotle-like places popping up. The main thing about Fired Pie is that the crust is GOOD. I am picky about pizza crust, and theirs is exactly what I look for: thin and slightly crispy with decent bite. With a great foundation, you can make a pizza to your specifications, and it's such a great deal! I love trying combinations involving pesto sauce, chicken, and whatever veggies I fancy that day. Only complaint is they are only open until 4pm on Sundays, boo.",

The crust is thin and crunchy and the meat toppings are top quality. I like the million different opinions there are for the perfect topped pizza. We saw the size of their salads and we were shocked at how big they were. This place is always busy which is great. That means they will be around for a long time. I HIGHLY recommend this place If you want the best cheap pizza ever.",

    "text": "Ok... here it goes. I give it two for the fact that when they make a pie correctly, it is a good pie at a good value.   If you are unlucky enough to get the kids (most of them that work there are) that have an attitude like you are interrupting their day so they have to work, then I feel for you.   You will get a pizza with a ton of sauce/pesto in the center (along with the rest of the toppings) and nothing but crisp dough on the outer three inches. It's more like a cracker that a pizza. And if you ask them to spread out the toppings, you get nothing but attitude.  I used to work in a pizzeria in high school. I learned the art of making a great pie. It's done by spreading the ingredients evenly (including the sauces), to the edges so each bite is what you came for in the first place. Not all the ingredients piled in the center and cold in the middle.  And how about you get rid of the kid that won't even look at you (or the pizza) when making the pie? If he can't make pizzas then maybe he can sweep floors instead? What a horrible example of customer engagement. Sorry kid, you actually have to work to get paid.  Please, please, please will the management do something about the training? Making a pizza well takes some work, but it isn't rocket science.",

    "text": "I'm a BIG fan of this place. It's basically like a Subway except for pizzas (they have salads too - whatever). Only one size crust, but from that point you can choose precisely what you want on the pizza, from several sauces, several different kinds of cheese (fontina, fresh or regular mozzarella, more), about ten different meats and plenty of different veggies including caramelized or raw onions, artichoke, black or kalamata olives. You can have them load your pizza with as many or few toppings as you like, they artfully arrange the items on top of the pizza base for you and then once you're done ordering they fling it in their giant oven and it's ready in generally about five minutes. The pizzas I've had them build are usually delicious, but unfortunately the last time I was there they slightly burned the crust. My one minor complaint only has to do with how absolutely NUTS popular this place is. A couple of us walked down at just after 11am to see if we could beat the lunch rush. 11:10am, there were about 20 people already in line. In the 15 mins that it took to get to the end of the line, order and have our pizzas in the oven, enough people had arrived that the line was out the freakin' door. Fired Pie just has an absolutely winning formula; long as they get the bake timing right the pizzas are fantastic and for a great price. They need a second oven though. Desperately.  A rare 4 stars from me.",

I decided on Fired Pie, when I walked in it was great. Literally no one else in front of me. I walked right up and immediately ordered my pie. I was a little bummed as the shift manager making my pizza was a little stingy with the mushrooms but oh well I have noticed this place has gotten stingy with their meats and veggies lately. I paid and pie was placed into oven. For some reason the shift manager decided to hold a staff meeting right then and there directly in front of the oven. As she talked to 8 or 9 employees for over 10 min. Again in front of the oven, I watched my pizza burn. It wasn't until I made eye contact with an employee and made an annoyed face did they turn around to look at my pizza. The manager had them start another one immediately and continued to talk as if it was no bother to her. When the pizza was done, no apology or anything. My pizza was put in the oven at 2:06pm and I didn't get out of there until 2:23pm. Again, there were no customers ahead of me. I like Fired Pie, it's why I don't mind driving so far to get it on a limited time lunch break. But I think I will pass on this location for now on.",

I'm a bit confused on where the \"Blue\" part comes into play. No Blue Cheese on the salad. The steak that is crumbled onto the salad was yummy. They tossed some sauteed onions and green peppers. That was surprisingly good.  The salad comes with a sweet Vinaigrette, it's to sweet, and really thick. I didn't care for it to much, it's so sweet, it leaves you thirsty ASF.  Steak and Blue...Interestingly enough Blue Cheese isn't even an option for a dressing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   The wait to order kinda sucks, the line was out the door and that was at Noon. Get there early or get there late, but don't get there when it's noon, you'll spend your lunch break looking at the back of some schmucks head in line ahead of you.  ~Big Daddy Long Strokes",

    "text": "So delicious. One of the best things about this place is that it's a very easy lunch spot to agree on. They have salads and pizzas and the ability to customize makes it so almost anyone can build a meal they enjoy.        This is an assembly line type place. There has been a line every time I've gone but it moves along quickly. The doughs are already ready on pans and you get to the front, tell them what sauce and cheese you want, they pass the pizza tray down and you add your toppings. Pizza goes in the oven and comes out super quick (I could guess an apprx wait time but I'm usually chatting away so it would probably be inaccurate).  The finished product is a personal sized, crispy, thin crust pizza. For those who are watching their carbs you can also get a salad, assembly works the same way minus the baking part. That would be weird.        The best thing about his is they do not charge for toppings so you can always expect to pay around 9 bucks... I retract... The best thing is the delicious food; the second best thing is the price.               My pick is a  pesto pizza topped with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. If I'm feeling adventurous I may add some chicken. If you are reading reviews to try and figure out if you want to go here I highly recommend you stop contemplating, close your yelp app and experience life... by eating this pizza.  ***almost forgot. The restaurant also attracts a lunch crowd from the surrounding offices/business and there is not a lack of handsome well dressed men. I do not object to this.",

I was ordering a bit on the fly (typically I have everything thought out but this isn't my first rodeo).  I thought I was being respectful and ordering quick to keep the line moving.  Well when Mr Sergio (who was previously mentioned in Leah V's review from 3 months ago - check it out his photo in her review) got ahold of my salad everything went downhill.  He couldn't be bothered with providing any level of service.  Had an attitude when helping me with my short list of toppings and when I asked him to please mix the salad dressing - well that was too much and that was the end of anything else.  He huffed and puffed and clearly didn't want to do this but very sloppily mixed the salad and threw it into my to go container.  Guess that means no more toppings (i.e. Croutons or other).  And the container had dressing all over the outside.  Extremely rude.   It's disappointing that this employee seems to have the same attitude 3 months later.  Guess I can't be surprised because when I asked for his name I asked the woman handing out the completed pizzas.  She indicated she was the \"supervisor on duty\".  I let her know the situation and she said \"sorry\".  That's it.  She couldn't bring herself away from her post to listen to my concerns and make me feel valued as a customer. So I get it - this isn't the only Fired Pie in the valley and there are more and more of these businesses popping up.  I will take my business elsewhere.  I refuse to support businesses that provide crappy service.  There are too many options.",

This is a build-your-own pizza place that is pretty much like Chipotle for pizzas.  On the wall they have instructions for building your own pizza, or you can select from \"pre-built\" pizzas like tomato and basil (margarita), Hawaiian bbq, meat lovers, etc.  It doesn't really matter whether you select a pre-built one or not because after that you can still put on whatever toppings you want.  They also have a selection of salads that I would like to try too.  My husband and his friends were particularly excited because there is no extra cost for extra toppings.  If you build your own pizza, it's 7.75.  If you select a pre-built pizza, it's 7.75.  Haha.    It was a busy weekday and the line was long, however, once you get through line the food comes out pretty quickly.  I went to get my drink and sit down and by then my pizza was ready.  The pizzas themselves are AMAZING -- one of the best margaritas I have had.  The sauce is savory and the crust is the perfect mixture of not too crunchy and not too soggy.  Add in the fact that the pizzas are basically $8 -- even more amazingness!",

    "text": "EXCITING REVIEW BELOW!!!...................................................  This review is about the wonderful staff. The delicious food. And an A-hole incident.  I have worked in and run many restaurants over a 30 + year stretch, so I know how things work.  I have been to this location 7-8 times and have always had the best, friendliest service. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure customers get what they want. They are always smiling and ask how we are doing.   The food is excellent. You can order a custom pizza, or order one of their pizzas and add what you want for the same price! They also have great salads that you can customize to your liking. They have the usual sodas and teas AND Great bottled beer!!  All ingredients are fresh. What more can you ask for from a nice, fast food-ish restaurant?  This next part is long, but very important............................................... Sat, the 24th, my GF and I arrived about 8:50 to see if we could still eat in the restaurant. The girl was very welcoming and apologized that they might be cleaning around us once they closed. Since we got there VERY close to closing, I was more than happy with her reply.   As we stood on line, a man at the front (who will be referred to as 'A-hole'  from now on. my word, NOT the staffs) spent at least 10 minutes asking every kind of question about the toppings. I felt that if you go into a place 10 min before they are closing, a person could be a bit considerate.  The girl rang up his food and as A-hole signed for it, he said the ingredients for the pizza were wrong. The girl apologized, but said it was what he ordered. She apologized again and said they would make him another. The first pizza got put to the side. A-hole ordered another pie using a VERY condescending attitude. \"Maybe if you listened.\" \" Seems like you could get an order right.\" \"You know taking orders means listening.\"   A-hole sat down and the rest of us ordered. I apologized (as we ordered)  in a loud voice for him being an A-hole. My GF and I sat down. The guy got called for his pizza, got it and started eating. After 10-15 minutes, A-hole gets up, goes to the counter and tells the girl the pizza is made incorrectly. She apologized,  but said it was what he had ordered. A-hole started making a stink and belittling her and the rest of the staff. He was telling the girl that apparently she could not hear. She replied that she did not take his order. A-hole argued the point for 5 (!) minutes, then realized he was wrong and said it was another girl (so apparently, he did not even recognize a person he had spent 5 + minutes talking to 15 minutes ago!). A-hole started telling the girl he was not satisfied with his 'customer experience', that he would not be back, that he demanded to get the pie for free (the girl explained that he had eaten half the pie before he said anything). And I believe that during the whole 'encounter' she had given him the first pie after he asked for it. A-hole kept ranting and b!tching, so the girl offered to call her manager, but A-hole refused. She insisted and called, but the manager did not answer. The girl gave the him the managers number and he stomped off, sat down and kept eating his pizza  (!).   Throughout the incident, the staff was obliging, apologetic and trying to make things right for A-hole.  I had had enough of A-hole, so I went to the counter and asked for some paper, telling the girl that I wanted to give her my number and get the managers name so she could contact me about Mr. A-hole. I went and sat back down. After 2-3 minutes, A-hole gets up and asks if I wanna give him my number also. I said I didn't have anything to say to him. That I would talk with the manager about the incident. A-hole came over and stood right in front of me, saying it was none of my business and blah-blah. I told him he was an ass and that he had better get away from me. He pouted some and left after telling the staff he would refute the bill with his credit card company. After we had finished eating, I went an apologized to the staff again. They were very gracious about the whole thing. GF and I left and on the way to our car, there was A-hole at Starbucks patio, eating his pizza!!  It takes a lot to serve people every day, People in the food industry are not lower than anyone else and they are not animals. Please take a moment to give some respect to the people around you that are doing their best to help you.  One last thing....  Mr hippie, prissy, d!ck, 'holier-than-thou', A-hole. If you see this, and I bet you will, Feel VERY free to contact me and we can do breakfast, lunch or dinner    :)   PLEASE!",

We arrived again yesterday and couldn't wait to get a Fired Pie. After her first bite, my sis said, \"Mmm, this is so worth the trip.\"  I love the thin, crispy crust, and the toppings are fresh and flavorful.  We got the Fired Italian salad and it was so fresh and crispy with the right amount of meat and cheeses. The staff was upbeat and friendly. Our order was ready when I arrived in less than 10 minutes from the time I placed the order. I highly recommend this place to eat.",

Understandably, the location serves the large local hospital staff, and can get packed fairly quickly. This location ran out of beef on our visit and we had to wait a bit for our order.  Nice for a quicky lunch, but not the top of my list.",

The staff at this location have always been friendly and accommodating. The Pepsi from their machine is good and not watered down or flat. The pizzas also come out fast, so it's perfect for a quick lunch. And, the salads are really good and you can again, choose what you want on them. What a great concept! (But I've tried another choose your own ingredients pizza place and it wasn't as good) Thank you park central Fired Pie!!",

They have a pretty decent craft beer selection also, which is always a plus!! :D   Definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "I give this place one star, due to the manager's horrible customer service. I have to be downtown for a workshop and was excited to go to Fired Pie because I have gluten allergies and they have a delicious gluten free crust.   The place was busy, I get that, but the manager was extremely rude. I asked if they could just scrape the little area where they cook my pizza, I wasn't asking them to clean the whole stove. The manager said, \"Ma'am, you can get a gluten free crust but we are not going to clean the grill with this crowd.\" I said, \"I'm not asking you to. I just need the small part where you cook my pizza, scraped. That's all.\" She huffed around and I said I'd just have to get the salad, I guess. When I asked if the salads were gluten free (crazy that some aren't) she replied with, \"Obviously, it depends on which one you get.\"   Um...obviously, which is why I asked. I decided to just leave and walked all the way to China Chile, who happily accommodated me.   I don't know anyone who would choose a gluten free crust, if she did not have allergies. It is not like regular crust, but I was so excited to be able to have pizza. My experience was ruined and I will never be back to the Central Phoenix location. The Westgate location is much more friendly, and knowledgeable. If you are going to run a restaurant, know your product. If she would have apologized and been at least an ounce of civil toward me, I would have understood.  The only saving grace was the super nice young man who was trying to help me and apologized. He deserves to be promoted to manager. Sadly, I did not get his name, but he at least saved me from total disappointment.   I believe in giving credit where credit is due...and also where it is not due. You missed the mark, Fired Pie. :-(   *****Addendum: One of the co-owner's contacted me and apologized, telling me he has reviewed policies with the manager. I could have had my pizza cooked on a tin, which was not offered to me.   It is so nice to have someone take enough care to try and remedy a negative situation. He informed me that he will send me a coupon for a free pizza. I don't think I'll be back to that location, but it certainly is a nice gesture.",

But I was not impressed by the Owner, being verbally agressive to the employees while they are assisting and making an order with our group. That was not professional,  I as a customer felt embarrassed for the employee myself.  It's a busy Friday night in downtown tonight, that was not needed whatsoever.  Before we excited the restaurant,  we also witnessed \"Fred\" continuing the agressive behavior toward a female employee. We had 2 young girls present, and they asked why was he so rude to the employee? We did see him, pull her by the arm and continue to use agressive language toward her.  We have been to plenty of eateries in downtown and we have never witnessed anything like this.  We will not let this go unheard. Be an encouraging Boss, you were more like a Bully!  Very disappointed,  and you are not showing your employees workplace manners by you acting the way you did Mr.  FRED.",
