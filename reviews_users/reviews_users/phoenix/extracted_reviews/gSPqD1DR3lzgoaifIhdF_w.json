We were able to write down what we wanted and hand it right to the sushi chef which was convenient! We had a few different rolls (btw the buffalo chicken roll is soooo good!) and ordered cold Saki. The waiter told us that there were only a few bottles left and to keep that in mind if we wanted to order more which was cool! We got to watch the chefs make all the rolls and at the end of the night the chef made something special for us! We don't know what it was but it was AMAZING hahah! We will be back the atmosphere was great!",

    "text": "Update - About a month and a half ago, a Squid Ink representative, Jo M, contacted me via Yelp to offer an apology and a gift card. She req my e-mail addy as well. She then sent two separate messages to my personal e-mail address over the course of two weeks pretty much saying the same thing and asking for an address both times, which I immediately replied back to each time. Another week passes and she contacted me on Yelp to see if I had received the gift card, which I replied that I had not. I was told that a new GM had taken over so she (the same Squid Ink rep) would personally send it out and check back in. That was nearly a month ago since the last message and nada from Squid Ink. I never once asked or expected compensation so I am not really all that bummed about a silly gift card, but I don't understand what the runaround and lack of follow through was all about.",

The second time, the sushi got sloppy and and service was slow. The chairs were still uncomfortable and the seating was weird.   The third time, was also my last. The sushi was mostly rice and fake crab, and that was all of the rolls we ordered. The portions also got a lot smaller. After paying upwards of $100 for 3 people, we all left disappointed and still very hungry.  *On a side note, the \"how was your service\" card that came with the bill already had the service rated as a 5. not sure if it was the last customer or the sever trying to be sneaky, but they should check those. I really did want to fill that out fully this time.",

The sashimi platter came with salmon, yellowtail (my fave), ahi, octopus, and because the server told me there was albacore even tho there isn't albacore. The fish was some of the freshest I have had in phoenix.  The cougar roll consisted of spicy crab mix avocado and some other stuff with a cucumber wrap. Light and delicious. I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Schuyler, very nice and pretty darn cute too ;)  I will definitely be back. Squid ink is my new go to for sushi!",

I'm still developing a more sophisticated palate for Asian food but the overall flavor in this dish didn't wow me. And it should have: soba noodles with filet, brocollini, mushrooms and carrots. A lot of my favorite stuff and a pretty balanced meal, but just not that tasty.  The filet itself was VERY nicely prepared and tasty but the overall blandness of everything else overpowered what was should have been the star of this show. I'm sure there's something else on the menu that properly complements it so I'm definitely coming back to try more stuff.  4 stars for the awesome set up they have. Their sushi bar is to the left as you enter, to the right is the bar and seating area. Despite my lack of enthusiasm for my first meal, I have MUCH enthusiasm for the bar and for the bartender who was really nice. I can't wait 'til the weather cools down and they open up the bar on the street (and they take down that damn scaffolding)  They play good music in here and the atmosphere is good. I'm sure they have some small plates that will go with the alcohol that I am looking forward to consuming at Happy Hour.  This is a neat place at Cityscape definitely worth checking out....if for nothing else, the bar!",

It is a spring mix, seasonal vegetables, chef's selection of assorted fish, and a japanese vinaigrette. The selection and amount of fish never disappoints! I'll sometimes switch up the vinaigrettes too.   I have a hard time ordering anything else, but I did it, and I was happy with everything! The house rolls- very creative, fresh and good, just a little pricey especially if you want to try a few. I would stick with an assorted sushi or sashimi platter.   Cucumber-lemon water...pretty basic concept, but amazing. Get a to-go cup. Beer selection is decent- the cocktail menu is better!  Service at the bar has always been friendly and quick.

We had a birthday dinner to attend here on a Friday night. From what I am told this place is pretty new. We arrived at 8pm and sat at the bar waiting on the others. The bartender (Asia form here on out) took my drink order and suggested other liquid treasures. They have a well Vodka that is really good. I was surprised. Asia was amazing, great energy, knowledgeable and just a good character in general. Definitely sit and kick back a few with her. When all the guests arrived we were promptly sat. I ordered the butter fish with strawberry miso sauce. WOW. Literally melted in my mouth. Cooked PERFECT. It sat on top of some asparagus spears that were equally as tasty. I didn't have any sushi that night, but from what I saw and was told there was not one disappointment. My only con of the place was the layout. This has NOTHING to do with the staff, but everything to do with the interior decorator. The seating setup toward the wall is awkward, causing the servers to have to shimmy on by or tiptoe behind you.  The place still seems to be finding the right grooves within one another and are doing it well thus far. I would definitely recommend this place as a local or out of towner such as myself.   Try it...love it...Yelp it...",

He promptly responded \"Let's do this tonight!\" because it's been months since we've eaten sushi. So we did. Aside from being open in a construction zone (apartments are being constructed on top of the hotel that's above this location) this is a gorgeous restaurant. The staff are friendly and attentive, but don't hover [thankfully]. During happy hour, select sushi rolls and signature cocktails are half priced; there are other specials but that's really what we were going for. These select items are limited, but enough to feed our sushi fixes. We had an order of shrimp tempura, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail (half priced HH specials), an order of salmon nigiri and octopus sashimi. Each was terrific, the octopus especially. We also order saki bombers. Sated and slightly buzzed, we paid our bill (nearly $50, not too bad considering the amount of food) and rode the light rail home, happy.   On a side note, the restrooms are tucked behind the main dining room. They were pretty.  We both decided we will be back soon.",

After eating here, I'm not sure why anyone settles for the so-so looking pub food offered at the eateries that are closer to the stadium.  If I can walk three blocks in 106 degree heat, anyone can!  So, I got there in time for Happy Hour.  Because of this, the seats at the bar inside were all taken, so they rolled up a window and offered me an outdoor spot.  I wasn't sure I'd be comfortable there (did I mention the temperature was 106 degrees?) but the area was in the shade, so it was quite pleasant and I stayed.  And I am so glad I did: for about $22 (including tip), I got fourteen pieces of delicious sushi (California rolls and spicy salmon rolls) and three tasty drinks.  If my travels take me back in Phoenix, I'll be back!",

The waitress was able to quickly answer any food related questions we had, and the menu was clear regardless. I appreciated how quickly the food was served, and the portions were fair in regards to the pricing. I definitely recommend this spot to both sushi and non-sushi fans (serves food other than sushi). It's an interesting scene, with a bar-like area and a few tables outside in the heart of CityScape to enjoy the meal outside. Overall, it was fantastic! It would be best for a date or groups under 5 people due to the limited and intimate space. Probably not the place for children. The dessert menu is bare with just three items, but the sushi seems filling enough to allow you to pass on dessert anyway.  ORDER THE CRAB RANGOON!!",

The miso soup was tasteless, just warm water with a few bland mushrooms floating on the top and a couple small pieces of tofu. The Manhattan I ordered was mostly sweet vermouth, undrinkable.    After the miso we had ordered the crab rangoon.  Normally I love these things but they were just mediocre here with cream cheese with a few random pieces of left over crab (or maybe it was krab) stuffed into a chewy doughy pouch.    Next we had the Surf n Turf Roll with was basically a roll that cost a lot, sounds good, with expensive ingredients that is drowned in mayo they call aioli.     For the main course we had order the Beef Yakisoba, and the Tuna Tataki.  The yakisoba, which was the good the first time we went, was a ball of overcooked noodles, matted into a doughy mass.  It was uneatable.  The Tuna we ordered came out 10 minutes after my meal, and turned out to be salmon.  Since the waiter never came back my date just decided to eat it.  It was overcooked too,l with a generic sauce that masked any taste the salmon might have had.  This place might be good to grab a quick lunch to take back to your cubicle but this is not a place for a business lunch or a sit down dinner. I guess the fact they have a fast food take out window should have been a good indicator of quality.  This is a place for office worker to get a generic alternative to a sandwich, but not a place I would go back to.",

I will never recommend anyone to go eat at Squid Ink and don't know how this place stays in business with such terrible customer service. And for those looking for good service I recommend the comedy club, my waitress had a full section the entire place was packed and it only took one minute after I was seated for the waitress to come by and take my order; and my drinks showed up a few minutes later. I highly recommend the staff at Squid Ink go over to the Comedy Club and see what real customer service really is.

Not only do they have both traditional and unique sushi options, it's high quality and (unlike other sushi restaurants) offers a full bar! Drinks are great, they have the usual sake and japanese beer options as well as a fabulous cocktail menu, plus their happy hour is totally worth it! I've been going there for several years, however, I now work in downtown Phoenix and can't help but stop by several times a week. Their bartenders are so friendly and even remember the names of their regulars and their preferences. One of the bartenders, Brian, not only remembers my name, but knows exactly how I like everything when I get my to-go orders; all of their bartenders and hosts remember me and always make me feel welcome. The manager Adam goes out of his way to make sure customers are satisfied and orders are correct. I only know him by name because I had a minor complaint about my take-out order in the past, and he not only corrected it, but has since always ensured my order is correct when I come in. They care about the quality of their food and the satisfaction of their customers...something that can seem hard to find in all restaurants these days. I could go on about how much I recommend them, but frankly I'm going to go back to enjoying my leftovers from my visit earlier today!",

Usually with happy hour sushi you get 4-6 pieces per roll...not here...you get 8-9 pieces per roll! We did not realize that and ordered WAY to much sushi (4 rolls) and could not finish it all. My husband had a Sake bomb...and he said it was ok..but the beer was weak and watered down. We ordered carb rangoon, the four rolls, and the sake bomb and our total was well under $30. If we are in the area during happy hour, we will return for sure.",

We didn't get our appetizer for about 20 minutes and then our waitress told us that the kitchen was substituting brown rice with white rice so we said that was fine. We waited for one hour for her to bring out vegetables and 4 pieces of shrimp, we asked where our rice was and she said they ran out so we wouldn't be getting some.. We told her we weren't going to eat there because first of all she told us we would be getting white rice and then for her to not bring us any rice, we didn't even get a full meal. She asked if we wanted to speak to the manager and we waited for 5 minutes for the manager to never show. We needed up just getting up and leaving... Safe to say me nor my friends will ever go here again and you shouldn't either. Worst customer service ever.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to try Squid Ink for some time as it is just downstairs from where I work out.  My wife and I decided that happy hour would be the best time for a low cost try of the food and drink.  The place is very clean and modern but common sense does not exist here.  We like to sit at the bar so I can catch up on news/sports I missed during the work day.  The bar has two huge roll up doors dividing the bar from the inside and outside which I'm sure is wonderful in the spring and fall.  At 5:15 it is around 55 degrees and they have both doors rolled to the ceiling with a 20 mile an hour wind blowing in our face.  The front door is open as well and it's like a refrigerator.  I asked our bartender, after we ordered, if they could close them and she said she couldn't.  Management thinks people will think they are closed, which they will be if they don't listen to their customers.  No place else was safe as it is a very \"shallow\" dining room from the door to the back.  Another couple took refuge in the back corner and had their coats on the entire time.  The three sushi items we ordered, cal roll, philly roll, and vegas roll were just average and though a bargain at $4 they just didn't have any style or pizazz.  The vegas roll at $9 was the biggest disappointment as it looked like they just dredged it and through it in the fryer for second.  Nothing special about it.  As soon as we struggled through the bartender asked if I wanted another drink and I told her it was too cold to hold the glass and we would have to go upstairs to the Blue Hound and warm up by the fire, to which she said no problem.  Did I mention the fact their entertainment is a guy with a way too loud PA singing Christmas songs?  You had to shout over his songs just to hold a conversation.  Give it a shot but I suggest you wait for a 78 degree day and way after any holiday that would invite singing.",

Even afer my girlfriend ask if we could just get a drink he became belligerent. Must have Been all the roids.

    "text": "I may be a little biased because this is directly under my apartment and it is so super convenient to swing by and grab sushi from here.. But I really like this place. It's quick, the service is great and it has a trendy vibe with an outdoor bar. Squid Ink has become my neighborhood sushi spot. I usually sit outside when I dine in, otherwise I'm ordering take out, which by the way is usually ready in ten minutes or so! The front desk staff, Aida, is so sweet and remembers me as soon as I tell her my name over the phone! A few favorites include the dynamite roll, which has a special twist with a whole cooked piece of salmon on top; unlike your usual crab topping that is typically garnished on the roll.   Once a week or so I have an extreme craving for their miso soup, which I pick up and take upstairs to enjoy with a movie! Another favorite would be the Pot Stickers- served with scallions and a \"tiger\" dipping sauce which is a ginger-soy tangy and savory treat.  One thing I would definitely stay away from (and the main reason there are not five stars*) is the Toro. I was a little disappointed with the Toro- (usually known for the fatty, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth consistency) ironically, the first piece of Toro I consumed was extremely chewy... I had to swallow the whole piece after trying to chew that one single piece for a prolonged period of time..  A few things to consider:  -There is a parking garage that is connected to the building (Cityscape), but I always walk so I'm not sure if it's validated. Fairly priced parking. -Quick bar service",

The only thing that was different and unique about this place was their green bean tempura which was a completely new concept that I had never heard of. Their green bean tempura is definitely worth. They're long, crispy, and have a hint of natural sweetness on the inside. Surprisingly, it compliments the fried tempura on the outside very well. It also comes in a decently sized portion for the price. I would recommend this place if you're in the area and craving sushi but definitely only come during happy hour!",

    "text": "My little sister is visiting me for the weekend to tour ASU's downtown campus (she is 17 and a senior in high school). We decided to go to Squid Ink with some of my friends tonight to celebrate her being in town. My friends were excited because in the past, they have received a free order of edamame at Squid Ink for showing their student IDs. One of my friends, K, asked our server if there was still a deal for the edamame. He said he would ask the manager. When he came back, she asked again, \"Just to confirm, the edamame is free, right?\" He said yes. (My friend K is quite literally the sweetest person I know, so this was all said in a really nice tone.)  When the waiter brought our bill, we realized we had been charged for the edamame. K was mildly upset because she hadn't been planning on ordering anything--she only bought sushi because she thought the edamame was free.  K asked us if we thought she should say something, and we agreed that yes, we probably should, just so they knew about the mixed messages with the student discount. K told the server: \"Hey, I thought the edamame is free or I wouldn't have gotten it, just wanted to know what the deal was.\" The server went and brought his manager back. His manager was instantly confrontational. He said, \"Are you calling my server a liar? Because he told me he did not tell you that it was free.\" The manager, Greg, then went to grab the server. I went to the bathroom because I did not want to be there during the confrontation.  When I came back, K was crying. It was really awful because, like I said, she is the sweetest person I know, and always goes out of her way to be polite. Apparently, the manager had told them, \"I will take care of your meal, but you need to get out now.\" My sister and I paid for our meal and left a tip to be polite. On our way out, K told the hostess politely, \"Could you please let Greg know that we will not be coming back?\"  The hostess replied snarkily, \"From what I heard, that's what he wanted.\"  K began crying again after we left. It was just a really sad experience for us because we were trying to celebrate my sister being home, and instead the manager was instantly confrontational when we were asking about a DISCREPANCY with the student discount policy for a $5 item--we were not even asking for our money back, and we asked very politely. My friends have been going there regularly for years and love the food but none of us will be going back.  What is most shocking to me is that I have worked in fast food service and at a grocery store, and the most important tenet of customer service is that the customer is always right. When a customer cursed at us, yelled at us, etc. we were told to give the customer free food. Here we are at a very nice sushi restaurant, four girls in our teens and early 20s, and when we ask about a discrepancy with a discount, we are kicked out.",

    "text": "I came here on a wednesday night at 7pm and the place looked packed full like it was the weekend. The host told us that there will be a 15 minute wait because they only have two waitresses working. We asked to sit at the sushi bar which had a lot of seats open but some reason she said there's a wait to sit here too. Anyway, we went to an urban outfitters across the street to kill some time.  Prior to arriving I looked through the photos on yelp and was very impressed with the interior design and also the sushi rolls looked very tasty! It is actually a lot smaller than I thought but it still looks very nice inside.  The menu seemed to not have much sushi selection. There are only 15 specialty rolls to choose from which I was surprised of a small selection. I ordered the seafood dynamite, hory fook, eel and salmon nigiri. I was really excited for the dynamite roll for the scallops from the photos on yelp but mine did not come out to how I expected. There was only a full piece of cooked kinda dry salmon on top of the spicy crab and cucumber rolls with eel sauce all over it which you had to use your chopsticks to break off the fish for each piece (not really sanitary to share) and no scallops to be found. I was with an old friend so I was more focused on catching up than my orders. The hory fook was okay nothing special, the tempura jalapenos was spicy if you like that. I actually ended up liking the salmon and eel nigiri more than the house rolls. The salmon was very good and fresh.   I usually never have a problem being happy with my order if I see it in photos before the order but I wouldn't order the two house rolls again. I live in the west valley so this location was out of the way. Ill probably try it again since it may have been the rolls i got but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

Which is always fun on the weekends. No telling who's going to walk by doing what. The bar staff has never been the same staff & the last guy that was working the bar the weekend of 1/9 during the Broncos/Steelers championship was a TOTAL douche. Made a big diff with his \"buddies\" than the rest of us at the bar. It was so bad that the next time my hubs wanted sushi in downtown the following Sat before 5 I didn't want to go here because of him. But our choices were limited to one so there you go. I was just hoping he wasn't going to be there & True to form the staff tending the bar was diff. YAY! The girl was from the now defunct Scottsdale location & was fun, personable & couldn't have been further from a douche. But that goes to show you no matter how yummy just one bad personal experience can turn you off. Just saying.... We got a new roll to us, the Seafood Dynamite & weren't fans because we don't dig warm anything on our cool sushi roll but the taste was very good. Just us. If you don't mind warm cooked fish as sushi go for it. It was very good. We are just  more sashimi folks. We keep coming back because all of the sushi, Nigiri & Sashimi is very fresh, tasty & delish. The Spicy Tuna is usually heavy handed on the spice which I REALLY like. But beware if you don't.  Also yum-my is the: tuna sashimi, octopus sashimi, caterpillar roll, shrimp tempura roll, cougar rolls but the roasted squid & roasted garlic edamame app are both divine. So good must get. :)",

He never brought us any waters, worse part was the table next to us got seated after us and had waters and apps before we got anything.  Our appetizer was forgotten, which happens but because the waiter never came to our table, so we didn't end up getting it until we were done with it whole meal.   At one point we had been sitting for almost 20 minutes so ignored that another waitress came and told that we would be helped soon.",

It was crazy downtown cause there were a number of things going on but we came early and found an empty spot at the bar, which is open seating.  We were immediately given menus by the bartender, and then forgotten about for approximately 20 mins.  It was so busy in there we couldn't even get his attention.  The lady next to us had been given her food, but no silverware, and was sitting waiting for 10 mins or so before she could grab someone's attention to ask for chopsticks.  I know downtown gets crazy on event nights but I do wish these places would prepare a little better. We finally placed our order and sushi was served promptly but we'd also ordered a hot appetizer which was nowhere to be seen.  About 10 mins pass by and they finally bring the 'hot' app which was ice cold.  The whole ambiance felt very disorganized and I got the feeling my appetizer should have come with the sushi but was forgotten, hence why it was cold. I ate it anyway.  Flavors were good but would have been been better when warm. Ambiance is great, as is the location. Prices are high, even for HH.  The sushi is good but nothing to write home about.",

Unfortunately I wasn't very impressed with the Dragon roll, which was very bland. The soft shell crab was nice though. The spicy tuna was pretty good as well, and had a good amount of heat.  The star of our experience was the sashimi platter. Each piece was tender and so fresh!  Nice little place. Steer clear of the rolls and stick with the sashimi.",

He was OK until i had to ask for napkins and sushi plates. I didn't bother asking for chop sticks. (We only had one set, one for each person i guess) Needles to say, by the time we got our sushi, we already had a bad taste in our mouths! The only good thing in this place is the server Justin!

Didn't try the sushi, and perhaps that's better, but their cooked items we tried were not good at all. Sushi in Phoenix isn't amazing by any stretch, but this place wasn't nearly as good as I was hoping it would be. To make it worse, our server was really aloof and not around at all, and that's coming from somebody who likes waiters who don't linger around. She didn't really seem to care that I barely touched the ramen, and didn't ask why. Overall I'd avoid this place in favor of the less pretentious options nearby.",

It's pointless to make reservations because if there is a group before you - they can take as long as they want & your group will have to wait.  We politely spoke to the manager who stated the table was already bused & they were just waiting - he had already \"attempted\" to ask them if there was anything else they needed. We waited 45 min before we walked to the table and politely talked to the group. The group had no problem clearing out & stated they weren't told anything about leaving nor was our reservation mentioned. They gladly got up and let our party sit. Yes, the manager gave us a round of free drinks, but not having to wait 45 min would have been better. I hope that his approach will be better in the future.

This is a great place to go and grab a drink and a bite to eat. I am only rating this location 3-stars because I have not tried any dish that I really loved. They do offer a wide variety of foods on their menu. I had some very basic sushi here that just didn't taste very fresh. This really put me off since this is a sushi house.

Squid was the only place open (that we knew of) around, so we settled in for a quick drink.  The waitress informed us that they were closing and really couldn't give us any food.  If she went to ask the chef, maybe they could get something together for us.  We passed on the food but asked for some hot sake.  The sake was pretty reasonable for about $8 for a large.  Everything went good and she told us to come back while we were still in town and try out the food.  She wouldn't be there the following day but to come back anyway.  Mistake!  The next day, we were trolling along the streets of downtown Phoenix again and decided to try a roll and some more sake.  The waiter was really nice and we ordered a rainbow roll.  My husband and I always order rainbow rolls because you can really taste the assorted fish on top for freshness and then still get a feel of how the chefs are with the rolling techniques.  Our itty bitty roll comes to the table and my husband instantly points out that the middle has a crab stick and not the shredded crab that consists of mayo, etc.  He is already disappointed. I venture on with my sampling.  Yeah uh no taste or flavor at all.  It was like eating weighed down air.  I literally could have eaten a dried ball of paper.  The fish had no flavor at all.  None!  The rice, tasted like they deliberately sucked the entire flavor out of it.  You couldn't even distinguish the avocado.  We left disappointed and wondering how the hell that waitress thought the food was good.  Maybe we should have come back when she was working and she could have told us the favorites.  Oh by the way, we were brought out some miso soup that was ok but definitely not the trip back.  We can by sake at the grocery store for cheaper.",

Not only did the waitress had to come and inform me, 20 minutes since I ordered , that there was a missing ingredient and I had to wait while someone went to get it;   my burger at best was mediocre. Already knowing it wasn't authentic kobe, I expected the burger to at least taste good. My burger came out with a soggy bottom bun and that didn't deter me. The one thing that made me upset was the bacon inside. It was hard and was similar to beef jerky. My first take on it was horrendous but I kept up the front of a satisfied customer because my waitress was extremely friendly. My sister ordered the beef short ribs and the presentation looked like it was sloppily thrown together last minute. The meat was described to me as dry and tasteless. The only good thing about the dish was when the waitress asked her if she wanted siracha, something my sister gladly took. My other companions liked their sushi but I recommend those who order something besides sushi to run to another place to satisfy your hunger.",

The location is great and the service was good but if you going here for the food turn around and throw a dart and I can promise you will hit a place that will be better for both your stomach and your wallet.   I am more than happy to pay for great, even good sushi but good is my cutoff.  Not a good sign when the bread pudding is your best offering. Btw, the bread pudding is yummy!!",

The staff was friendly but the service was very slow, our waitress did not check in on us at all we had to ask for ginger several times before she brought it out. I had 2 drinks a mule and one of their specialty drinks both were horrible and had was too much like, I didnt drink either but was still charged for them. The chicken fried rice was dry the sashimi was bland and texture was off and the rolls were falling apart. I'm guessing they were understaffed this evening but not even an apology a 150$ meal and most was left untouched.",

I have so many food allergies that clash with this type of cuisine, but the sushi chefs and the BOH have made it work. They take food restrictions seriously, which deserves gold stars in my book! The other reason why I'm writing THIS review is because of AUSTIN. If you come in, ask to sit in his section. His positive energy is contagious, and he's incredibly polite and attentive. Be sure to show him this photo and tell him who sent ya!",

Apparently Sunday is happy hour all day, thank goodness because this place isn't cheap.   Pros: - our waiter is the best!  - food came out pretty fast  - spicy tuna was seasoned well, not too spicy   Cons: - roasted garlic edamame was overly salted and no garlic flavor except a few pieces of roasted garlic thrown in  - the menus had no description of the rolls whatsoever  - the restaurant was extremely hot - the cooked rolls as in vegas and soft shell crabs tasted like the rice was mushy and overwhelming",

To top it off I asked for the check and took forever and I mean forever to bring it, one of my friends finally went up to her and said can we please have the check already and again she's like oh I forgot so really bad experience and the sushi isn't all that either way over priced.",

Dirty Rockstar & Pokemon rolls were bomb af. Spicy Lemony Goodness.  Zushi \"Box Roll\" was a total miss. Way too much crab and rice. Fail.  Cocktails - The Genever and Muddy Something were fantastic.  Kind of on the pricy side, but got treated super well so A+ service. I came in last night, they were pretty dead, and I was the only one at the bar so I think the sushi dudes spoiled me quite a bit. pro-tip: going to a vacant sushi bar is the best because everything comes out fast and they tend to be more generous on servings. Servers were extremely friendly and helpful. I think the fact that it was relatively vacant helped in giving me superstar treatment.",

It had a $17 price tag, so I am glad it was good. We were celebrating, and it was so worth it! I also tried the Buffalo Chicken Roll, not my cup of tea, but my husband devoured it. He said it was his favorite after the Khaleesi.  I also tasted a soy paper one with crab (sorry forgot the name) it was very good as well. I will say we tried three mixed drinks and they were all a bit too sweet for me, maybe add a more sour or savory mixed drink to the menu, but I will honestly always grab a sake bomb with my sushi and unless something else gets highly recommended.",

He also got the dragon roll which he enjoyed, not so much on the California roll. He said it was bland and dry.  I had the vegetarian udon, I liked it... but the sauce was too sweet and there was too much of it on my plate. My non vegetarian las vegas roll was really good.  The last fifteen minutes of our dinner date, the music got really loud and it was hard to have a conversation.  Lolz.",

Great location. They have Happy Hour Pricing on multiple drinks and food items.   We tried the spicy yellowtail roll and were pleasantly surprised how good it was. The next item was a pan seared butterfish that was amazing. It was moist and delicious and served on a bed of roasted asparagus with a light sauce.  We were impressed with how they handled a large raucuous crowd with aplomb and kept it festive. We will definitely return. Love the late night hours too!",

The service seemed to fall by the wayside for the last few months, and we came here out of desperate convenience. Bartenders later at night were too consumed with joking with/flirting with their co-workers and forgetting about us; the food service was slow or often just incorrect; and the fish became less than mediocre (chewy or fishy sometimes).   The last couple of times we noticed that the service is significantly better with certain crews- Friday evenings and week nights. They're prompt, polite, and the quality of fish is now fresh again. I'm docking from a 5 because 1) there's still better sushi out there, and 2) the Saturday afternoon and Sunday evening crew need to step it up. They still seem to allow themselves to get distracted. In comparison, the PV Squid Ink location is better.",

Minus 1 star.  We were eventually seated by the hostesses at said high tops (after waiting a little bit). 15 minutes went by and no one came to our table to serve us. I asked the bartender if there was a server for our table. She said yes and we saw her alert the server, a manager and a hostess about the problem. Another five minutes went by and still no one showed up to take our order.  Around then, two seats opened up at the bar, and, having no more time to spare, we moved ourselves into them. From that point on our experience was delightful. The baritender was attentive and the food was delicious.  You would think they would be used to being really busy before events at the arena, but apparently they are not. Aim for the bar during busy times.",

Stumbled upon this place after a craving for sushi rolls came over us. We were skeptical at first, but were pleasantly surprised. We ordered more food than we could finish, but everything was decent.   Fries w/ nori powder = surprisingly tarty! We ordered skinny fries vs. steak.   Gyoza = eh. Nothing spectacular. I'd order another plate of fries for an appetizer.   Hamachi nigiri = decent slice of fish. Rice was ok. Nothing special, but I'd order it again.   Sashimi salad = I didn't have it, but the two in my party who had it, loved it. Nice slices of fish on a bed of lettuce in a bowl.   Dragon roll, spider roll, Philly roll = standard, but no wow factor.   Tuna overload = yum! Spicy tuna on the bottom, topped with chunks of big eye tuna, wrapped in cucumber. A refreshing tasty bite!   Hory fook, buffalo chicken sushi = I know, BUFFALO CHICKEN SUSHI?!?!!! Pass on BOTH sushi rolls. The Hory Fook lacked taste (not sure what it was) and the buffalo chix sushi was just...odd.   Miso salmon = DELICIOUS!!! Moist, tender, sweet tasting salmon. Yum! Served on a bed of rice and sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and carrots. The salmon and veggie mixture was superb! The rice on the other hand? Not cooked all the way. A little disappointed.",

To start, this place has a pretty decent happy hour until 7pm every day  A few good drink specials, half price appetizers, and some specials on rolls. We arrived at 5pm and were immediately seated.    I ordered the Revolver- A vodka drink with ginger syrup ($5HH).  Great Flavor and just strong enough.  We ordered the shisito peppers ($2.5 HH).  Interesting, but not something I would order again.  We also ordered a few rolls- Philly($4HH), Flying Phoenix ($12 HH), and Hory Fook ($10 HH).  I loved the specially rolls.  The sauces complemented the fish and you could taste every ingredient/flavor in the roll.  The Hory Fook was too spicy for me but the hubby loved it.    So why the \"Meh. I've experienced better?\"- during our meal, we were pestered by a few nagging fruit flies.  Given that we had a view of the sushi bar, everything looks clean and orderly.  After finishing our meal while waiting for the check, I looked behind our book to view the artwork.  Right above our heads on the both were at least 20 fruit flies resting. EWWWWW.  GROSS!

Service: When we first walked in, we were sitting at a temp table until the table we reserved was ready (and it was never ready). No one was assigned to where we sat while we were waiting. We were there without a glass of water nor anyone stopping by for 10-15 minutes. We finally asked the host who our server was and he told us that we weren't assigned to anyone until the table was ready. He knew that we were upset and offered to take our drink order and found us a waitress right away. Service was decent since then but wish it would have been a bit more organized since the start.   Food: I ordered the fried tofu from the appetizer menu and it was great. However, the Ramon noodle was super salty. I couldn't even finish the broth because of it. My friend ordered a salmon dish and it was very fishy. He couldn't finish his menu neither.   Rating: I am hesitant to come here again. Menu was overpriced probably due to location, but I think I can get much better food elsewhere.",

We ordered a California Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll, and some Pork Pot Stickers. The rolls were spot on and the Pot Stickers were some of the best I've ever had. We enjoyed everything so much that we ordered one of their specialty rolls - I think it was call the dynamite seafood roll, but don't hold me to that. When it came out it was a roll covered in chunks of different seafood including squid, salmon, and a few other things. Then the whole thing was covered in some special sauce they created. It was really yummy. Honestly, I would have given this 5 stars, but our server was beyond slow. Everything took forever! I know sushi normally takes time, but we really thought he had forgotten us. Our drinks sat empty, we had to flag him down for water, and I literally had to wave to him to get a bill. Hopefully, he was just having a distracted night.",

The sushi itself is what you'd typically expect at a sushi restaurant.  I did note that none of their specialty rolls sounded particularly appetizing to me because they all contained something fried.  So I stuck to the rainbow roll and tuna roll.  Both were good, although the fish was not AS fresh as I would have liked.  Additionally, the tuna roll was made kind of messily and was falling apart at the ends a bit.  The favorite part of the meal was the marinated squid salad - delicious!  I would come here again if I had another late night craving for sushi!  p.s. - they validate for parking if you park in the garage directly adjacent",

Though the presentation was very nice with Krab meat, pork belly, scallions, and egg - the taste was a massive disappointment.  The broth was bland and actually bitter. It tasted of diluted burnt meat. The noodles, which looked like they came out of a Top Ramen package, shaped in a block with wavy noodles, were overcooked. They were too soft and lacked any bite. I'm surprised this is still on the menu.   An odd side note, when the waitress retrieved my uneaten bowl, she actually asked if I wanted a box to take it home - instead of asking if there was anything wrong.",

Stay away from the trendy/stretch stuff (e.g. the grilled squid appetizer) - order that where you've developed confidence in the restaurant.   ATMOSPHERE: fine, nothing mind blowing. Solid music imo.   SERVICE: good-natured and fairly attentive. No complaints.   FOOD: the short rib was very good. Presentation was average but it's 99% about the taste, and it was great. Melts in your mouth. However, the reason behind the 2 s was the \"grilled squid\" appetizer. The calamari rings were not right - truly like eating leather, I can't articulate it any other way. Not sure if it was undercooked or just poor quality. I'd rather have a restaurant with consistent, average, predictable food than one with a strong entree but an seriously off-putting appetizer.   PRICE: non-sushi is reasonable, sushi (especially nigiri/sashimi) seemed exorbitant, even by New York standards. Perhaps that's a function of PHX being relatively land-locked.",

The restaurant was immaculate and well taking care of.  Super modern but dark as hell.  Smart move to truly prevent us from seeing the subpar quality of the food.  But daddy knows quality with taste and smell, not just sight alone.  The loo was super cool and super clean.  Service was slower than slow!  And the waiter was kinda odd and said it was super busy.  It was not even close to busy, not even close to their capacity.  If they consider that busy, the problem is definitely theirs.  Although he was slow and odd, he was friendly and polite.   The food was average, actually I'm gonna be real, it sucked!  Not worth the high price at all.  The eel was not fresh, and the tuna had a funky taste unlike anything I had ever ate.  Note I have eating plenty of fish in my life.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was Walmart grade tuna...The eggplant has no taste, the egg was cold, the banana looked like a \"wiener\".  A deep freaking fried wiener.  The water tasted like the sewer and the lemon couldn't save it.  A cucumber might have though.  The wonton soup, that puny thing was not worth no 5 dollars, what was that a kids meal soup?  And the avocado roll, was more avocado than rice... so imbalanced.  Might as well went to Trader Joe's and pick up a dozen all organic Avocados at that price.   Overall an approaching average experience, will not be back.  Lower your prices or bring up the quality.  That's my advice for this place.  On a positive note, the restroom was cool..... I squid inked it good in there... just kidding!",

Luckily it was happy hour and the tootsie roll was $7 and the vegas was $9. We also ordered pot stickers and they were soggy because they automatically put the sauce on it. They should put the sauce on the side and you can decide whether or not you want to dip it. This will make the potsticker not soggy. The service wasn't that good.

    "text": "Squid Ink:  It's rich in iron and antioxidants and provides a number of potential health benefits!    Too bad I didn't see any squid ink dishes here.  :(  Upon first glance, this place was great.  It was sleek, the tentacle artwork was interesting, and the layout was a bit cramped but efficient.  When asking for a table, our host warned us that they were short staffed and busy.  Way to try and drive business away.  After getting our table, we looked around to a half full restaurant at best but boy was service lacking.  We could never find our waiter!  Anyways, for starters, I got the table some Shishito Peppers [sea salt | bonito | tiger sauce, $10] and two of my dinner companions got the Wonton Dumpling Soup [miso broth | pork dumplings | scallion, $5].  The shishito peppers were pretty decent.  The bonito flakes gave the peppers a nice umami taste and the tiger sauce was light.  The peppers itself had a nice heat to them.  They say 1 out of 10 shishitos are spicy.  I'm glad our plate was more like 7 out of 10 are spicy.  The wonton soup was a dud though.  Just imagine eating a bowl of miso soup with two gyozas swimming in it.  There you have it.  For our main entrees, we got a various assortment of items.  Here are my thoughts:  SPICY TUNA [maguro | avocado | tempura eggplant | asparagus | sesame seeds | ponzu | sushi rice, $14]:  This was ordered by Jannette L. with the addition of a poached egg.  I'm not a fan of spicy tuna so I didn't give it much thought when she ordered it.  I don't recall any maguro or asparagus now that I'm re-reading the description.  Anyways, it wasn't anything to go crazy over and I wouldn't order it again.  It was pretty bland with exception of the slow steady heat from the spicy tuna.  The tempura eggplant needed some flavor and was more reminiscent of biting into a fried sponge.  COCONUT CURRY SHRIMP [tiger shrimp | broccoli | carrot | onion | mushrooms | yellow curry | basil | rice, $16]:  This was pretty delicious although a tad too salty.  Tran D. had ordered this and she seemed to enjoy it immensely.  CITRUS YELLOWTAIL [yellowtail | avocado | grapefruit | cilantro | ponzu, $13]:  Probably my most favorite bite of the night.  Fresh sweet yellowtail with an explosion of citrus flavor from the sauce and the creaminess from the avocado... yum!  The BLVD [white fish | king crab | avocado | cucumber wrap | yuzu vinaigrette, $15]:  My second favorite bite of the night.  The cucumber was fresh and the white fish was tasty.  But at $15 for five bites?  Yeowch.   EEL CUCUMBER, $9:  I didn't try this but I heard it was standard by Simon W.'s opinion.  AVOCADO ROLL, $6:  I ordered this to accompany my BLVD roll.  Hey, I need more than two bites for dinner, okay?  The avocado roll was mainly avocado with the thinnest layer of rice.  A bit uneven if you want something with more rice but I love avocados so I wasn't mad.  It's definitely unbalanced though.   Dessert was a BANANA KATSU [vanilla bean ice cream | palm sugar | coconut milk, $8] shared between us four.  I was expecting the coating to be panko and not tempura but alas, it was a tempura battered banana.  Nothing thrilling and for $8?  Eeks.  Squid Ink may look pretty but they serve a pretty mediocre meal.  I think this is a one-and-done kinda place for us.",

I can't be mad that I didn't get happy hour prices, but I am upset they didn't tell me any of the exclusions beforehand especially since I asked for it.   I am not fond of the food.

I had the Vegetarian roll which I found out isn't Vegetarian as it contains dashi.  This would be suitable to call pescatarian for those with dietary restrictions / allergies.  I am thankful our server was kind enough to inform me of this.  Figured I should share this new found information for Vegetarians or Vegans.  I think Squid Ink should update this, and remove that it's Vegetarian since it isn't.  I also had the miso soup which was good.",

The sashimi could be a little meat-ier but overall good portion and their miso soup is just enough for a satisfying lunch.  For dinner though, avoid this place like the plague on a Friday after 3 PM. Last Friday, I waited over an hour to get seated and was told my party could sit in the \"community\" if we didn't want to wait. They were busy with a pretty big party but they were on their way out as we finally gave in and sat some friendly strangers (nice peeps!).  Another 10 minutes to get waters. Another 10 minutes to get drinks. Another 10 minutes to order food. Another 20 minutes to get our food (which by the way was the skimpiest cut of sashimi I had ever had). But they were real quick to give me the check as soon as I looked remotely done.  There's another sushi spot down the road about a mile from there...just saying.",

I'd ordered the Thai Fried Rice bowl during their lunch special, with an add-on of chicken. Had a minimal wait when I arrived, signed for my order, and was promptly brought my food. Got back to my desk to start eating and while the fried rice was fantastic, the chicken, was definitely lacking in flavor. It was extremely bland, and really actually took away from the dish. The real kicker came this morning when I checked my online statement and noticed that the bill had posted for three dollars higher than what I signed for. To me this basically seems that the server/bartender had adjusted my bill post signature, which I do not find a very ethical practice. That being said I can't recommend this place or won't return.  -Christopher",

It's definitely crazy when packed and there wasn't a lot of flow to the process.  You kind of just stand in the middle of everything if you want to wait inside or you cook your face off outside.   Our table was unfortunately in the 180 degree sun but it was the only one open and it lasted only 15 minutes.  It took several minutes to be helped but the server was really nice.  I had two glasses of Pinot Grigio and my wife had 2 Tito's and Soda drinks.    The Happy Hour had some good options so we ordered off that menu and off the regular menu as well.  We ordered the Vegas Roll, The Pokemon Roll and the Flying Phoenix Roll.  They were not bad but nothing I would say wowed us.  The potstickers we ordered were good and we also got the shrimp tempura.    I would say it was a good experience but it could be better.  We would probably try it again to compare it but for $150 including tip, expectations were a bit higher.  Again, not a bad experience and we may try it next time we are in the area.",

Me and a co-worker were sat and got drinks immediately but waited over 30 minutes to get our food order taken. We watched the waitress take other tables orders, all of which, were seated after us. The waitress(Samantha) gave a lame excuse so we asked for the manager. Dave, the Manager, was also all about excuses that made no sense. When we finally got our food, 45 minutes later, we never did get our soup that comes with our lunch order. Dave told us we should have asked for it. The staff is ALWAYS iffy and ever-changing. There seems to be a lack of management overall. Dave did give us 50% off but professionalism would have gone farther with us. I say the negative about the employment at Squid Ink but their food is outstanding. I have never had a dish that was not wonderful.",

    "text": "I was visiting Phoenix for a conference during the Memorial weekend, so my friends and I were walking around downtown to look for a place for dinner. In the middle of the downtown square, we found Squid Ink. The first thing that grabbed my attention about this place was the set up and the atmosphere. The interior design was very modern with multiple artworks around on the walls. They also had outdoor bar seating with television screens showing sports games. The overall vibe was very modern and chill which I really enjoyed. The menu offered variety of option including unique sushi rolls and other fusion cuisines such as Kobe burger, which I ordered. Although this place mainly served sushi, I've been craving burger for awhile so I decided to risk the odds and order. Contrary to my worries, the burger was amazing. The bun was thin and the meat patties were very thick, which I personally prefer. The sweet potato fries were crispy and fresh, and the two unique sauces that came with the fries also complemented the entree very well. I would've loved to try the sushi rolls as they were not your ordinary \"rainbow rolls\" you see in any other sushi restaurants, but unfortunately I will have to wait for another chance to visit Phoenix. All my friends seemed to have enjoyed their food, and we all definitely left the place being satisfied. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive to our needs which made our experience even better. If you're new to sushi, I would highly recommend starting at Squid Ink, as their menu is very fusion and not too traditional.",

The rice, was lumpy and flavorless, after not bearing to force myself to eat this gunk, I flagged our waitress down, Chelsea, and told her that as much as I tried liking that plate it was horrible and not Fried Thai rice!!! That it was steamed not fried, she argued back claiming that it's made that way, and then walked away shaking her head!! Talk about rude! Then the Chef came out to apologies, which was truly nice. He claimed that a trainee prepared my dish, and that it was made incorrectly, then brought over a plate he claimed to have prepared himself, it was just as flavorless, but without the funky balls of steamed rice and without water chestnuts, (they probably thought I didn't notice!).    Very neglecting and rude experience! I will never ever, come back to this place! Non-deserving of bringing in a lunch crowd, as I did before!!!",

He got our order then took the order of another table before dropping ours off. Which wouldn't be an issue if he hadn't later blamed the kitchen for the 25 minute wait, the other table got their meals before ours. After bringing by our food, they didn't ask if everything looked okay...not noticing we didn't have soy sauce, which he grabbed from another table with patrons still sitting at.   We also witnessed other tables receive 'edamame on the house' while others did not.    While we waited for our final roll, another server almost delivered us another table's food. We watched her leave our roll at a table for 2-4 minutes, come back..pick it up..and bring it to us.   While the decor and location are great, the good would be worth the price if the service was better. Walk over to Harumi. You won't get a quartz bar and patio seating, but you will have amazing service and better foods d spend less.",

I had some sushi for lunch the next day and it was great then went back to the Beef Short Rib for dinner again with delicious green tea ice cream. I had take out all three times and they were super fast even on a Friday evening (15 mins). Highly Recommend!",

It was way too salty and the beef tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved. GROSS. I could have done better if I cooked the noodles from a packet of ramen and topped it with jar teriyaki sauce. I paid $15 for this, what a waste.",

    "text": "I'm only giving this place a 1 star because we have to and the location is nice.  We sat down outside at 6:55 before the happy hour ended.  Our server comes up and we want to order the HH special but she tells us it's 7:00 and we can't order the specials due to the automated systems. Ok well we tried right?   I order a drink because I wasn't too hungry.  My cousin and her friend were looking at the menu to see what they wanted to order.  So our waitress comes back to the table and only asks my cousins friend if she was ready to order, takes her order and walks away.  Then she comes back to ask for my cousins order but in the most awkward and rude way.  So my cousin order like the crab wontons or something, and they turned out to be really salty.  So of course, our waitress doesn't come back to see how everything is, we have to wave her down.  She comes to the table, and my cousin tells her the wontons are really salty.  You can clearly see the salt chunks on top so she asks her if thats normal and all the waitress says is \"yup\".  Really?  Yup? Oh I already know what my tip is going to be after I get the bill, learn your manners girlfriend.  So once we're done, we are ready to pay buuuut our waitress is nowhere insight.  So we're noticing how super awkward she is and she makes us feel really uncomfortable.  I have to remember that I'm not longer in California and that racism is pretty huge in Arizona but geeze, why work with PEOPLE if you have some sort of prejudice?!  I'm just assuming but I got that vibe that she does not like too much diversity in one sitting.  So there was another waiter near and we ask what's her problem and he's like \"I'm not really sure\", so we tell him we're ready to pay.  It looks like he goes to the back to find her and a few moments later she comes back says \"I heard you were looking for me..' What?! WHAT!!! Giiiiirl you seriously have an attitude problem for no reason at all.  We give her our money to pay, because you know, we surprisingly can afford it.  So we ask if we can validate with her and she says yes.  I was digging in my purse to find my ticket but I couldn't but she stood there just staring and waiting like I was inconveniencing her.  Mind you this is the longest she's ever stood at our table the entire night because she walks away super quick when she had to bring the food to the table.  I tell her nevermind, I'll get the lady at the front desk to validate, because she was making me feel very uncomfortable.  We filled out our feedback cards and let them know right away that her service was beyond unacceptable.  I don't know if I could ever give this place another chance.  I was so disappointed with the way we were treated but who knows, maybe one day.  The food overall, eh.  Maybe if it wasn't for the lackluster service, it would have been better, but homegirl ruined everyones appetite.",

When we finally got seated we were there for about 10-15 min and no one acknowledged we were there so we walked out. As we were already out the door the manager Tim was able to convince us to go back and let him make it a better experience for us. We went back in had the best customer service, Tim made sure we were happy with the all around visit to squid ink. By far the best sushi we have had in quite a few months. Thank you Tim for the outstanding customer service you provided and how you were able to convince us to go back in definitely well worth it! Absolutely will go back!",

For the amount of sushi given and blandness of the Nigiri, the $11 price point was not bad. Be sure to add fresh Wasabi to your order to supplement your sushi!",

While I usually peruse through the menu and skip straight to the alcohol, I've never been disappointed with the food here and neither have my clients. From catchy names like the Hory Fook which, is delicious by the way to usual sushi menu items like their sashimi, I can definitely say that it's worth eating here besides drinking here.   Service is good usually. When things speed up on busier nights expect a little bit of a wait for alcohol if you're at the bar. Pricing is what you'd expect for a downtown sushi joint. Parking is a little bit of a difficulty but I always use valet. Modern look and some cool murals give it a trendy/classy vibe which is usually reflected in the people that come here, ha ha. All in all, always a good experience.",

    "text": "I'd heard about Squid Ink, but never got the opportunity to try it because of its location (whoever invented one-way streets needs dive into a never-ending well, immediately).   Unfortunately, this place is overrated, expensive and just overall a shame. Everything was so confusing and clammy, literally. Not sure whether they decided to lay off the A/C but it was so humid, warm and sticky inside that I didn't even feel safe eating the sushi. All 8 of us were sweating as we ate inside, fanning ourselves with the drink menus. The irony of it all was that it was raining heavily outside and we seemed to fare better out there afterward.   The agedashi tofu was a mysterious mess. The breading was soft and wouldn't break apart easily when you chewed on it, while the sauce that accompanied it was an overly heavy pile of slimy goop. Instead of the usual light dashi broth you expect with tofu, they covered it up with what tasted and looked like a mix between orange chicken sauce and sweet and sour. If fast food offered tofu, this is what I would expect it to be like I guess.   So, I moved onto Plan B which was to then drown my sorrows as I was going to party with most likely an empty stomach for the rest of the night. I ordered a cocktail but as it turns out, I just ordered world's most expensive Caprisun because there was barely any trace amount of alcohol.   When you're downtown, your dining options are still pretty limited at dinner times though we're making great strides. But, what do you do if before or after a ball game/concert, you get a sudden, voracious hankering for sushi? For now, unless you have a reservation at Nobuo, take an Uber and get the heck out of downtown. The illusion this place brings just because it's located at a hotspot is definitely deceiving.",

But that ramen was confused! The broth was blegh, salty with this egginess from the noodles. Three HUGE pork brisket cuts... I was expecting something like tonkatsu, but sadly no. Then, there was spinach leaves, way too much, as if I were gonna have a ramen salad. The eggs weren't even tea boiled, and to top it all off there were several logs of imitation crab. What?! Just... what?!  I couldn't finish it.  My server was friendly and nice, but that ramen was by the far the worst ramen I've had in my entire life.",

CONS: It is a little pricey (to a certain extent this is warranted given ambiance, real crab, and menu selection).  Specific to my visit: I gotta say I was intrigued by the idea of  the Buffalo Chicken Roll but it was a disappointment.  Not very much flavor at all, and considering you're getting chicken for the price of sushi-grade seafood... not a great value either.  My other roll was fantastic, so it's not indicative of all their food.  I'd just take a pass on that one roll.  And finally, a shout-out to my server. She was quick, attentive, perky, and genuinely pleasant to interact with.",

    "text": "I wouldn't consider myself a sushi snob and I'm far from a sushi expert, however I love sushi. I could eat it every day. I've had sushi at restaurants all over the U.S. Squid Ink was good...not great...not mind blowing...but good.   I recommend this place on the random late nights when you get a sushi craving. Romantic date night? Not so much. If you're looking for high end sushi dining, this is not the place. If you're looking for a great happy hour or a quick sushi meal before catching a show...Squid Ink is a great place to try. The menu has plenty of sushi to choose from w/ a large fish and flavor variety. I am a fan of the Vegas roll. My boyfriend enjoys the ramen (something for everyone). The cocktails are great too. I do really love the happy hour menu. I had 2 rolls of sushi and a glass of wine for $20. You can't beat that!  I get that downtown Phoenix is still in a \"revival\" stage so my expectations for a dining experience with ambiance are not sky high, but I was hoping for a little more pizazz here. I do visit regularly and really enjoy the staff. They're all awesome. I just wish the menu evolved more often.",

    "text": "We've been back here a few times and felt that each time it is less good. My husband says, \"there's nothing memorable about it, other than I didn't like it\", and for some reason we don't remember that the place kind of sucks and we make the mistake of going back. Today I was reminded once again when I parked in the garage downtown with the intention of shopping at a store nearby which turned out to be closed. I was starving for lunch, and already parked, so I stepped inside Squid Ink. It was a Monday around 1pm. Hardly anyone there. And this place charges way too effing much during lunch. I don't eat rice, but I like getting a few plates of sashimi and seaweed salad--only this place overcharges so I only order 1 small plate of tuna. For $14 I got five bites. Thin bites. And it wasn't even top grade. They even poured soy sauce onto the plate and laid the pieces on top of it. Horrible. I don't put soy sauce on my sashimi, so that was a red flag. The seaweed salad was miniscule, freezing cold, and gelatinous.  No flavor. They charged me $7.25 just for that alone. My pot of tea was hot water and a single teabag (I had to unwrap it myself) of super cheap (like a 25 cent) teabag of cheap green tea for which I paid over $3. So my meal was shizz...and after a $5 tip, because I'm not a monster, my quick Monday afternoon lunch cost $31.48. So eff me. I will NEVER go back to this place again. Hiro sushi in Scottsdale is hands down THE place to pay those prices, for a way better, much more authentic experience. Screw Squid Ink.",

    "text": "Terrible sushi, good hot sake because.. how can you f up on sake?  We came here after our New Year's celebration next door, which was supposed to be a rooftop party that got rained out.  Well things happen, but we enjoyed that and afterwards walked from blistering cold to here for some food and drink.  Sushi bar closed, so hot sake only and we promised them we would come back the next day and we did.  Here's the review..  The customer service no doubt is really good!  We ordered their $12 Rainbow Roll.  Price is about right, as it usually cost that much.  The Roll came, the presentation looked really good with the special 'L-shaped' dish.  But, I immediately notice that the imitation crab was not mixed up with mayo in being broken up mixed with mayo and instead it was just a plain old imitation crab stick itself inside the roll.  Ok, fine.  First bite, it did not give me the heavenly feel, a good rainbow roll would give.  The fish tasted bland; poor quality fish.  The roll was bland all together.  They should have at least had mayo mixed into their imitation crab to at least give it some kind of flavor.  Tasted like Safeway sushi.  They probably did buy from Safeway and took it out of the case to earn a few extra bucks to sell here.  The roll was so cold.  RIce did not tasted fresh.  Horrible!  While we eating their sushi, I was thinking to myself, should I grade them like an actual sushi restaurant since I didn't pay attention to their full restaurant name on whether or not, they included sushi as part of their name, but yes, they do have sushi after Squid Ink.  So there, I can review them harshly.  If it wasn't for the customer service, I would have given them 1 out of 5.  I would not be back for their sushi; but drinks, yes.  I am not a sushi chef and I can make wayyyyyyy better sushi than this!",

The waiter forgot about our drinks and by the time we reminded him, they were lukewarm. By 10:40pm, we had not received our sushi rolls. There were tables that came significantly after us that had already gotten their food. We asked them to do our check since our rolls hadn't come out. As soon as we were paying which was at 10:45pm, sushi rolls were brought out by the hostess, and we told her we didn't want them anymore. She gave us attitude as if we were the ones at fault for two sushi rolls taking nearly half an hour to come out. Horrible service and I will not be coming back again.",

Kirin light sake bomber was normal size. We ordered the calamari which was really over cooked and rubbery. The citrus yellowtail was good with avocado and ponzu sauce. Also had tuna sashimi which was good, but the slices were thin and narrow. Not your usual serving size, may have been the end of a filet. We also had the chicken teriyaki bowl with grilled vegetables and white rice. The chicken was very similar to the the calamari hard, rubbery, and dry. My wife was very disappointed. We had the rice pudding which was good, but the overall experience was disappointing. We spent $103.44 for the meal and would have received a better food quality and experience elsewhere. The parking was validated for two hours. We were there for two hours and forty minutes. Slow server, food and drinks took very long, quality of food was rubbery. We must have come on the wrong day, since our daughter recommended the restaurant. Very disappointing.",

Asked the hostess before i ordered how many pieces do you usually get and she said 6-8 so either my math is off or hers.  Quality of food was decent, again not a justification for the high prices.

Another 15 minutes I am informed that the kitchen is backed up, and lunch orders are taking a long time. I place my order and after another 30 minutes, no food, not even a beverage or appetizer. After 45 minutes, I get frustrated and get up to leave. In their defense, as I get up to leave, my food is finally ready and they pack it to go and comp the meal. I accept their concession, but would rather have just had a peaceful lunch in the restaurant, rather than having to tote take out sushi to the conference center.",

They were decently busy but got right in and sat on the patio, good people watching with the events and ice skating right there. Heater on patio kept us warm, which was nice. Food was good and it had a cool atmosphere. The live music on the patio was really good! Down side was the service and cleanliness. The girl serving us was awful - took three times to ask for water until the busser finally brought it out half hour into us being there, never brought us napkins or utensils (had to go get it myself), never once checked on us until the end when she tried to butter us up for a tip. Blah I hate servers who just expect 20% for shit service. I would have left 5% to make a point but my friend couldn't do it. 10% is eh service, 15% is ok service and 20% is great and anything more is well deserved for going above and beyond. But this day in age, everyone expects at least 20%. Squid Ink wipe your soy sauces bottles down, it was disgustingly sticky.... And clean house on your entitled servers. There are tons of kitchy sushi places with much better serve that I can go to.",

    "text": "We finally tried Squid Ink after wanting to get there for the past few weeks.  I just wish we didn't try it on the night of the Tosh.0 concert... When we got there it was pretty crowded and the hostess told us it would be about 30 minutes.  We told her we'd be at the bar to get a drink while we waited.  After about 5 minutes, one of the bartenders finally acknowledged us and we ordered 2 Hendricks and tonics.  After about another 5 minutes, I asked a different bartender about our drinks and she says, \"oh the Hendricks and tonics, yes coming right up.\"  We got them in pint glasses which I thought was odd because we didn't request tall drinks.  Then she hands us our tab without asking if we'd like to keep it open.  I would give this experience a D and only not an F because we did eventually get a drink. About this time everyone starts leaving for Tosh, so the restaurant and a few open tables.  We waited a few minutes and then went to ask the hostess if our table was ready.  She said she called our name already, but we weren't there so she moved to the next.  Well the waiting area is quite small and we told her we'd be at the bar, so I didn't really understand that. We got seated and ordered.  The server seemed to not really to know the menu, but the food was really great.  Had another miscommunication with a different server about our drink order, but that was okay.  I really want Squid Ink's service to redeem itself because the food is quite good!  I will try again in a few months, but for now will stick with Moira for downtown sushi.",

We got to squid ink about 12:20 and as the waitress brought our waters we put in our order immediately. We ordered 2 bowls of chicken teriyaki and 2 rice bowls with shrimp and curry. We also got edamame to start with. The waitress brought our edamame in about 20 minutes. We waited about another half hour not being checked on without our waters being filled to be told after being there for an hour that our white rice was being substituted for brown rice. We said that was fine and the waitress brought out a complementary fried tofu appetizer. About 15 minutes later the waitress brought two of the dishes which were the shrimp dishes. All that was in the dish was steamed vegetables and four pieces of shrimp. I asked where the rice was and the waitress said they were out of rice. I told the waitress we weren't going to eat a dish with just shrimp and vegetables and she asked us if we wanted to speak with the manager. We waited another five minutes for the manager who never came to the table. We waited for an hour and 15 minutes for a dish with four pieces of shrimp and steamed vegetables after the waitress made us think we were getting some sort of rice. We ended up leaving without speaking to the manager. This was the worst customer service and the worst dining experience I've ever had. Don't go here!",

Lucky for us, the hotel wasnt offering their usual happy hour deal so we were in a scramble to find a new spot with good food and drinks - Squid Ink to the rescue! Not only did they have a happy hour on NYE, but they have amazing food and great local craft beer on tap. Couldnt have been happier when we go there - great place with amazing staff. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were so attentive and friendly, even offering to ring up our final beers before happy hour ended and bringing them to us when we were ready. Loved the food - the crab rangoon had huge chunks of crab in it, the wings were great, and the miso black cod dish? Probably the best thing I've eaten in months. Ridiculous - and for half price happy hour! Absolutely loved this place, cant wait to go back and meet up for happy hour again with my friends soon.",

And, seriously, if I am paying $11 plus tax and tip for fried rice, I expect it to come with more than 3-4 small pieces of chicken.  I actually ordered it because I thought it was something on their menu that couldn't be messed up.  This place has really gone down in quality of food and service since it opened.  I will not eat there again.  I also really do not like the fact that they leave their soy sauce containers sitting out in the sun and heat on their patio (I work in the area, they leave them out every single day, all day).  They've been doing that for some time; apparently someone needs to get sick to before they will take notice.",

My co-worker and I arrived at Squid Ink just minutes after happy hour ended, yet the waitress was nice enough to let us still take advantage of the happy hour specials (maybe pulling the 'out of town, here for business' card worked?).  We both ordered mixed drinks, and both were very tasty!  We sat outside, which was nice with the misters on the patio.  They made me forget that I was sitting outside in the Arizona heat!  Sushi was probably some of the better sushi I've had.  My only slight dislike was the green tea ice cream I ordered for dessert.  Don't get me wrong - it was delicious.  However, the serving size was HUGE.  It just didn't quite match up with the smaller servings typically associated with a sushi place.  I could've easily split my dessert with a table of 4-5 and still have generous portions.  Overall, I would recommend this place and go back.  Great service.",

It was lumpy, loose and completely flavorless. The tempura jalapenos were soggy and really just icky. I ate two of them and the waiter said, \"oh eyes bigger than your stomach, huh !?\" I said no I didn't like it and he just landed the check in front of me and walked away.  Poor execution and poor service.  I will probably try again but they're going to really have to raise the bar.",

The clear plastic seating is an eyesore and not properly cleaned, so it shows all the little smudges, spots, etc (and they are not very comfy). Our waitress was either new to waitressing, or too shy for the job. Come on, if my menu is in the way when you are trying to put my glass of water on the table, say excuse me. Don't push my menu into my chest with my water to make room. She also barely checked up on us. For a Monday afternoon and hardly anyone in the place, I expected a little better service.  The food was alright and edible. The rolls are anything but sushi. Almost everything has ingredients that requires cooking, which isn't sushi. What didn't require cooking, such as the rolls topped with salmon, came in at room temperature and wasn't very appetizing. My friend loved her dynamite roll though, and I admit, I liked it too. I ordered a roll that had tempura shrimp and the tempura coating was rubbery and stretchy, meaning it wasn't freshly cooked. So gross.  There's better sushi out there with much better atmospheres.

Now, I'm not usually a sushi fan, but I came here because my boyfriend is an avid sushi lover, and I thought that it would be a great place for a date night.  He was blown away by the unique rolls, the quality of fish, and the great prices as well! We had such a fun time and enjoyed it all - especially the surf and turf roll! I also loved the Tahoe roll. It has crush macadamia nuts on top.  The service is just as great as the food. We enjoyed everyone working there, and especially enjoyed speaking with the manager, Carrie. She was very professional, laid back, and easy to talk to.   Not only will we be back to stuff our faces with sushi again, but we'll be back for the service as well!",

I'm sure it's something to be taken for granted in sunny AZ, but I loved being able to sit at a bar out in the sunshine while it was snowing back home. Yes, I realize that makes me sound like a rube coming to the big city for the first time in his life, but it's True (well... gooooooooollllllly!).  It's a little light on vegetarian options, but the noodle bowl was tasty and large.  The age dashi tofu was unlike any I had before, but that wasn't really a good thing.  HUGE blocks of tofu with a slightly sweet breading and lightly drizzled with a topping. I liked it a lot on the first bite, but after the first one it was so heavy I couldn't eat much.  Prices were decent and the beer was cold.  I can't say I would make a special trip if I was back in town, but the food was decent, the service was friendly, and ambiance was pleasant.  Actually, I really liked the bathroom.  That's a big plus.",

What is disappointing is how much their happy hour has changed over the last couple years, it really is not much of a deal anymore. Their food is good though, the potstickers are amazing, as is their Kobe burger. The service is hit or miss, but most of the times it is a miss. Most of the hostesses, waiters, waitresses, and bartenders are fairly rude and unhelpful most of the time. We have had a couple good ones, but that is on a rare occasion. Also, besides the bartenders, we have never had the same waiter/waitress, each visit has been a different one, so it seems that they have a lot of turn over. Their beer selection also tends to leave a lot to be desired. They always have Sapporo and they have various local brews on tap, just never many good ones. Overall this place is okay if you are craving some sushi, but definitely do not go out of your way.",

It looked like they were hit with a rush and we didn't get taken care of by a waitress...the waitress noticed and quickly came over to address the issue. She came back with waters and said the waitress would be with us quickly. She was very sweet!!! The service was surprisingly quick despite the dinner rush.  I also loved the vibe and music.

Our server told about a seared duck breast special that was kind of a head scratcher.  Nonetheless, it was a hip setting, staff was very friendly, the fish was fresh, and we were in every way satisfied.  The Tahoe roll flavor wise is superb.  The sushi chef was not a technical wizard but I wasn't expecting Jiro or anything.  The scaffolding/construction zone situation seemed to really hurt the outside seating area's potential.  We sat inside as a result.  I hope that gets resolved soon, this is an awesome time of year to enjoy the AZ weather.   Keep up the good work.",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to checking this place out since it opened in Phoenix.  The atmosphere was exactly what I expected, chic yet laid back.  It's right next to where they have the ice rink set up for ice skating and the massive Christmas tree so it was a great view from the bar.  The server was friendly and fast.  I had the Deep Water cocktail...I didn't realize it was spicy so I wasn't really expecting that, but it was pretty good.  Also got an order of the dumplings which were exactly what you'd expect, nothing over the top.  Sushi we had a house roll and something basic, both were good and again...supah fast!    Location is great as I mentioned, but the parking was meh.  Had to park and walk a bit which can really suck in 4in heels.  If I'm in the area I will absolutely stop in again because it was an overall good experience, just didn't knock the ball outta the park? Know wadda mean? :)",

Appetizers were not much better; Japanese Fried Chicken tasted strange and Tempura Shrimp was very average. We would have liked to try a few House Rolls as the table next to us ordered them and they looked decent. Friendly service as well, but overall a disappointing HH experience.",

Water with cucumbers and stuff like that. We didn't order any drinks; thought the prices for drinks were absurd considering it didn't look like most of the cocktails had a lot of alcohol content.   First thing we ordered was the sushi lunch platter. They brought out something that was different than what was on the menu but I ate it anyways. The sushi was not good. Tasted like what you find at Whole Foods or similar groceries; bland and stale. Not spicy at all. The sashimi were tasteless and strangely warm, which was unpleasant. Also ordered the coconut curry shrimp bowl, which was pretty tasty. My complaints are that the sauce was too sweet and rich, which made it feel kind of gross in my stomach afterwards. Also, $13 for some rice, four shrimp, and a boatload of sweet curry is just asking a little much. Would have enjoyed a few more veggies or more shrimp.  Service was good. Weird bathroom scenario. Would give it another try but not order sushi here.",

The food is super expensive, even with their happy hour pricing, and you don't get nearly enough to eat. Our group left making plans to go elsewhere to eat because everyone was still starving.  The bathrooms there are super obnoxious. There are no signs, so I asked a waiter directions, and he merely told me, \"Yes, we have bathrooms,\" and promptly left. Nice guy. I chanced a random hallway and ended up in what I thought was the guys restroom, because there was a dude there washing his hands at the counter.  No. You find a random closet to do your business, and everyone washes their hands together. Cozy. Except then you get to catch the waitresses who don't wash their hands. Oh yummy.  Our plates were dirty, there were flies everywhere. And it was disgustingly hot in there.  I suppose I should say something about the food. My buffalo chicken rolls were not bad (I'm pregnant so I'm not allowed to eat real sushi), and the chicken fried rice tasted like it was made from a box. The others said their Cali rolls were super bland.  There was one other waiter who was super nice too. I won't leave him out, so he'll make up the second star. But everyone else... Well, I can't blame them for hating their jobs I guess. Lol.",

Not quite the same as the crab rangoons I'd get back in New England, but better than the crab puffs that seem to be the norm around here.  The Hory Food was decent too.  Nothing amazing about it, but a good flavor and spice level.  But, while the food was decent, I felt that $21 was a bit on the high side for an appetizer and one roll.",

We ordered some sushi for an appetizer and it was good.  I lived in Japan and I really don't like eating food out of region so I'm not the best person to review sushi.  Seemed fine to me.  The burgers were excellent.  Great balance of flavors, everything worked well from the bread to the beef to the additions.  Almost on par with Delux.  We took it as it is on the menu and they figured out a good recipe.  Worth the time and money.  The good and the bad....  The location was great.  They were prepping for some events downtown and there was a lot of foot traffic.  The restaurant was full (but didn't see people waiting).  We had a nice view of the street traffic and it was nice to get that \"downtown\" feel.  Lots of high energy inside and out.  That being said, it was sometimes hard to hear my date because of the noise.  It's a bit loud.  It's a nice place to go with friends after work but as a first date it might be a bit challenging.  I don't blame them for that, but just giving you a head's up.  Sushi, sashimi, two burgers, a bottle of sake, tax and tip, was about $95 for two.",

It's walking distance to where I live so if I want to partake in the full range of the Happy Hour Menu I certainly can; not to mention all the rolls are fantastic (during happy hour I usually get the Hory Fook And Spicy Salmon) if not, the Chef's sashimi platter is Fantastic. Lastly, if you want out of the ordinary Apps, get the Tokyo Frites or Wings.   If you are a sushi fan, or want a great happy Hour Hour, go to Squid Ink!",

Knife work on the fish is not the best.(it helps to sharpen your knives) and do not stack the sashimi to make clumps of fish. Fan it out for presentation   I guess when you come to Phoenix from San Francisco I should change my standards. But if that were the case, how can they charge high end prices for substandard quality?  I won't even go into the slop they called a $16+ duck bento bowl.  Disappointed.

    "text": "I had this ridiculous hankering for salmon sashimi last week, and I was extremely lucky to find that there was a sushi place a block from my hotel. Also, I wanted to enjoy an outdoor lunch - it was 65 and sunny in Phoenix. I needed to enjoy it before I went back to freezing Cincinnati temperatures.  This is where squid ink comes in. Their patio is beautiful and a great place for people watching while you enjoy your meal. I ordered a beer and salmon sashimi, plus a roll. The bartender was kind enough to give me miso soup to start as it was technically lunch, although I didn't order the lunch special.  Let me tell you, the sushi quality is FANTASTIC. The sashimi was buttery and smooth, just like good salmon sashimi should be. My problem with this particular restaurant is that their flavor combination rolls are absurd. The restaurant has extremely fresh fish to work with, but all of the options for rolls were over-the-top and unappetizing. I ended with the Pokemon roll, which included pickled jalapeno and pineapple. Why? Why would you ruin the beautiful fresh flavor that comes with the quality fish you have? That is only reason I wouldn't come back. If I am in Phoenix and want sushi again, I will only be getting nigiri and sashimi here.",

Except for once out of the five times I've been here within the last two months, they were out of either the Uni or Toro. Always.  When you ask the servers or sushi chefs about when they get in their fish, they never give you a straight answer and say all throughout the week. I know all the Japanese restaurant distributors here in AZ and they will set a day of the week for your deliveries.  The sushi chefs also have a tendency to make your portions of Tobiko and Uni quite smaller when you reorder the nigiri for round two. For example, I order uni to gauge quality and when I like it, I'll order a few more. The upcoming orders are noticeably less full.  Will continue to visit and post updates.",

    "text": "I decided to meet a friend for lunch sort of last minute yesterday.  She works in a pocket of town where there are not too many restaurants, so she suggested we find something at Cityscape.  She had been wanting to try this place, so we popped in.  It was a cute place, with the sushi bar directly in front of you and a bit to the left when you walk in.    The table we were seated in was in an area to the right that was way too small for my comfort.  The aisle was way too narrow.  As I was trying to walk to my seat at the end of the row, two waiters assumed right of way and I had to yield and wait even though my friend was already seated.  It was a minor inconvenience, but I felt claustrophobic for most of the meal with people walking so close behind me.  There was no way to scoot my chair even an extra inch or two back.    The tap water is served with a skewered slice of lemon and cucumber, which was a nice touch.    I ordered the Spicy Tuna bowl, which came with a huge helping of spicy tuna, rice, avocado, asparagus and eggplant tempura.  It was quite tasty.  She ordered a Flying Phoenix roll, which had spicy crab, shrimp tempura, avocado and was topped with tuna tataki.  It was very well presented.  Our bill was only $30 with tip included, so it was a fair price for a nice lunch.   Overall, I liked Squid Ink Sushi.  In the future, I would opt to sit at the sushi bar or ask to be seated at one of the tables that was not in the area with the small aisle.",

Our waitress was patient with us from taking drink orders to explaining the contents of certain rolls to ensuring everything was OK. Of course we over ordered because our curiousity and eyes were bigger than our appetite but it was all very good.   I was a fan of the seating, decor and bar area and would recommend for any occasion!",

The beef short rib was dry and the flavor just seemed off.  I'd be willing to give them another go though when it's sushi night again.",

    "text": "First time at Squid Ink. Stopped for pre-movie dinner for three on a Friday night. Arrived at 6:30, before happy hour ended and got good deals on beer and some rolls.   The restaurant was fairly full so we took seats at the sushi bar and were seated right away. Our server was training a new server and it did not detract from our experience in any way.   We ordered drinks, two apps and seven rolls and the bill came to $68 before tip which was a really good deal. I got a beer, shared the garlic edamame and potstickers and then ordered a spicy crab roll and spicy tuna roll.   The edamames were very good with a perfect dusting of kosher salt and some cloves of roasted garlic. They were steamed just right. The potstickers were amazing. There were five of them and they came in a tasty teriyaki sauce with scallions that was divine. The pork filling was cooked perfectly and had a hint of garlic.   My rolls were big, fresh and cool while the cucumber was crisp and bright. The best touch was the black sesame seeds mixed into the rice, which gave it a great nutty taste that rounded out the flavor. It was just the perfect touch.   I recommend Squid Ink for an evening dinner or late night snack.",

We were kinda upset that we weren't told this sooner since we were there for a while. Any Who long story shot Jeff and the manager on duty made it happen and we all left happy!  The sushi was amazing and the service was excellent. Even the hostesses & bartenders while we were waiting for table. It was an extremely busy night and the crew handled it beautifully!

A large selection of rolls to pick from and the skewer we had, although just a single one, was tasty and nice to order and nibble on while sipping the cocktail.  i did feel like the cocktails were pretty weak.

The drink selection is pretty substantial with all of your favorites, including beer, wine (respectable selection including a wonderfully rich Malbec), specialty cocktails and a fully stocked bar.  The sushi menu is good for special rolls.  I was, however, a little disappointed with their veggie options, particularly no shitake mushrooms.  Bummer.

The host greeted us and brought us to a table relatively quickly. The host came and greeted us and took our drink orders. We made our drink & dinner order. My boyfriend had a beer, I had green iced tea, 1 roll, 1 hand roll, 1 nigiri sushi, potsticker appetizer & 1 duck confit. The appetizer came out fine but it was mediocre and super doughy. Then my entire sushi order came out before his duck confit. Waiting another 10 minutes his order finally comes out. He tries it and it's cold. Really? Was his order just sitting there? We alerted the waiter and he said they would get another one out asap. I finish my green tea and the waiter refills with water. I told him I had green tea and my boyfriends asks for another beer. Another 15 minutes later his duck finally come out and it warm but not hot. But he's so hungry at this point he just wants to eat. My green tea was replaced but his beer is still empty. The waiter comes by and asks if there's anything else. My boyfriend says he's still waiting on his beer. I had a clear view of the bar and looks like his beer was just sitting there. The waiter forgot it was there. We finished dinner and I had 2 pieces left on my roll. I went for another piece and saw a short blonde hair (I have long black hair) laying on the roll. Gross!! I wanted to throw up. We alerted the waiter and all he says was \"oh\". Took the plate and took it off our bill. I was really surprised that the waiter didn't seem phased by an or things going on last night. Most people would be really apologetic and go out of their way to make it right. All we got was \"oh\". Does this happen a lot? Needless to say I'm not going back. I'm totally disgusted.",

Nonetheless, it was a hip setting, staff was very friendly, the fish was fresh, and we were in every way satisfied.

Very friendly staff and looking forward to coming here again!",

    "text": "My coworker and I went there for happy hour yesterday.  Great location since we work downtown so it was walking distance.  The restaurant looked nice on the inside, very hipster.  I was super hungry and ready for some good sushi at great happy hour prices.  We ordered 4 sushi rolls (rainbow, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, yellowtail) and 2 sake.  The bill came out to be $50...which is already 1/2 priced for happy hour.     More bad news?  The sushi was the worst I've ever had.  They were pourly prepared and the chef took forever.  The rice was dry, fish tasted old and store bought (Fry's), not fresh.  Regular price would have been $100 for 2 people.  I would have been livid!    Oh yeah, and while we were there...at least 5 flies were flying around.  Good times.",

    "text": "My girlfriend was in town and we had just gone to a Suns game and I know she loves sushi so I thought lets try Squid Ink.  It was crowded for a Sunday night, but the hostess said it was only a 10-15 minute wait.  I gave her my phone number and she said make sure you answer they only call once.  Understood.  about 20 minutes go by and still no phone call.  I go back to talk to the hostess and meanwhile people who I had not seen waiting around got seated right away.  A woman in front of me mentioned that to the hostess and they gave her some run around how the bar was not open but now it is.  It was then my turn and I asked if my name had been called and she thoughtlessly just said umm.. yes we called you... *pointed to her sheet* see it says \"called.\"  Obviously i see it says called, but I told her that i did not actually receive a phone call.  The hostess just said oh well, we only call once.  Again I understood her, but there was such a lack of customer service and even a lack of offering to say that you'll be next on the list or even an apology.  She then took my number down again and childishly said to make sure i said the number slowly.  After finally getting seated the food was just sub-par.  We started the night with the garlic edamame which was actually pretty good.  But as the rolls came out i was far from impressed.  We ordered the Flying Phoenix and the Zushi \"box roll.\"  The Flying Phoenix had Tuna Tataki which i was looking forward to trying.  Unfortunately the sauce that was on it was way too overpowering and the Tuna was way too peppery.  Call me a snob, but if you can't even taste the True flavor a raw fish then there's something wrong.  2nd was the Zushi \"box roll\" which was supposed to have yellowtail on it.  The \"box\" of rice was quite large underneath what appeared to be a non-existent piece of yellowtail.  The yellowtail was not nearly half the size of the block of rice it was sitting on and having to pay $14 for that was just frustrating and disappointing after the lack of service from the get go.  Needless to say I will not be going back.  Cheers!",

I wanted saba but was told the chef didn't like today's fish so instead I had sea scallops (which should ne hotate but turned they out to be bay scallops).  The egg in the tonkatsu ramen was probably the best part of the dish. The broth was almost inky; very unusual. Even though it was dark it didn't have the typical rich, deep flavor. The pork, of which there was a generous amount, was either grilled or pan fried. Different but good.",

She brought the check and my friend reminded her she was going to take care of it and her words \"I am not trying to pull a fast one\" I will take care of it. We advised how to split the check and my friend went to the restroom.  Corey came back to the table and said \"a tuna roll is not accounted for so I paid it.  When my friend returned from the restroom I told her what happened and she could not believe she did not take care of it. We ordered eel sauce that seemed as though it was mutating in front of us and Corey even said \"oh that is definitely not good and took it away and brought another side of it although no one was really interested any longer. I must say Corey did buy the table green tea ice cream \"great gesture\" however it does not make up for the seemingly dishonesty with the tuna roll. We will never go back to this establishment. We all work in customer service industry and this experience was very poor.",

They do take a while so $7 is a decent price for the appetizer. But the drinks and sushi were extremely pricey and at the end of the night our waiter forgot about us. We had to go to the front to ask for the check. I'm never going back. Not as long as ahai Hana  and kabuki exist in Phoenix.",

Upon entering, my husband and I were warmly greeted and we took our seats at the bar. The bartender, Asia, was helpful in explaining the menu and the drink options to us. We settled on the tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, and the spicy tuna roll. Everything we had was really delicious, and we were pleasantly surprised by the sashimi portions....6 LARGE pieces of the most succulent sashimi I've ever had for about $11. I felt like it was pretty reasonably priced for what you got. The spicy tuna roll was like no other spicy tuna I've ever had. It was actually REALLY spicy, and tasted like it was made in-house and not store-bought like many other places' spicy tuna. The decor is modern, and we learned that the painting on the walls is done by a local Phoenix artist, which I thought was really cool, because the murals are amazing and I love seeing local talent proudly showcased. It is conveniently located in the lower level of Cityscape and is unfortunately still a little obscured by some scaffolding all around it, so don't miss it! I am happy to have another late-night food option in downtown Phoenix, and since they have happy hour and TVs for sports, I can see me and my husband making quite a few return trips here.",

We shared a couple of appetizers to start, edamame, roasted garlic edamame, green bean tempura, and potstickers. I tried the potstickers and green bean tempura which were very good, I'd highly recommend the green bean tempura. I'm very boring when it comes to sushi, so I just had the california roll and spicy tuna rolls which were good.  To finish off, we shared the green tea ice cream and hawaiian bread pudding. The bread pudding is out of this world good, the green tea ice cream was pretty basic. The prices were good and the service was also good, I'd return.",

He had 2 orders of salmon sashimi,one spicy salmon roll and one spicy tuna roll.  He has eaten a lot of sushi and knows what he likes.  He first started off with the sashimi. A bone poked him in the tongue.  It wasn't bad but it startled him.  We just kind of laughed and he kept eating.  He had never had a bone in his sushi, and he has eaten a lot of sushi over the years.  When he got to the spicy tuna roll he put it in his mouth and immediately spit it out.  He said it tasted bad and he was really grossed out!  We told the waitress and she offered him something else.  They were nice enough to take the tuna roll off of our bill.  He ordered another spicy salmon roll.  As luck would have it there was another bone!!  This one was over an inch long and if he bit into the sushi the wrong way could have really hurt him.  At this point, I took a picture of the bone, paid the bill and left.  Probably won't  go back.",

There was a 15 min wait for a table and while waiting we looked through the menu and everything looks good. When we were seated it took awhile for our waiter to get to use to get our drink orders. After getting our drink order it took him awhile to get us our drinks. Seeing that service was pretty slow we decided to put our order in right away. I ordered the seaweed salad, chef special ramen and the spicy tuna. My friends ordered the assorted sushi platter and spicy vegetable udon. I got my seaweed salad and it tasted like every other seaweed salad I've had. When I got my ramen I was excited to try it but I was disappointed. The broth had no flavor at all. I had to keep adding soy sauce but it was lacking salt. The noodles tasted like they came from a Shin ramyun packet. When I got my spicy tuna the same tasteless theme continued. The rice was very plain lacking of flavor and the tune was just spicy with no flavor. My friends didn't like there dishes either. My friend didn't like his platter saying it was flavorless. My other friends udon said it was very sweet and not spicy at all.   Overall our experience was pretty bad. The slow service and lack of flavor in the food we will probably go somewhere else next time.",

By the time i got checked in everything had stopped serving at the hotel bars and restaurants, but this place was next door and still open.  I was a little skeptical of a sushi joint open at 10 with only one other person there who sent back her ahi poke because she didn't realize it was raw fish. At a sushi place the raw fish surprised her. Nonetheless I didn't feel like wandering so I went in.   Had the yakisoba and the green bean tempura. The tempura was lightly battered and the green beans were fresh and crispy. The yakisoba noodles were cooked well. The steak on top was bland, mostly because the sauce was in the noodles. Taking the effort to mix everything together in proper ratios it was quite pleasant, at first.  The spicy teriyaki is good but it becomes a bit much towards the end of the plate.   I threw in some pieces of sashimi (Salmon and tuna) and a yellowtail nigiri. These were nothing special. Nothing wrong with them but nothing good either.   The place has a nice decor but seems very quiet despite the vibrant happening vibe they are trying to project.",

The sauce on the noodles was spicey and a little sweet and just perfect. I am still thinking about this meal and can't wait to go back and order it again soon.  Three rolls - rainbow, dirty rockstar, and another one wrapped in cucumber. They were all fresh and tasty and accompanied by plenty of ginger.   My friend asked them to hold the sweet sauce on her roll, but we received it with the sweet sauce. It was crazy busy so we didn't really mind.

Please pay attention. It matters.  Upon being seated by our host...that was it. As three employees were standing at the front chit chatting I had to get up & request water. YES i had to ask for water. We ordered our food which was delicious. Dirty Rockstar was perfectly  spicy.  But again service lacking. Part of the problem is the style of how employees are  catagorized.  servers only serve. Bussers only buss. Host only seats. When it's busy...everyone needs to step in & help out.  It's just the nature of the  business. This seems to be a management issue. As I always say.. my whole reason to go out is to get good service along with good food. Otherwise I can stay home & eat. Sorry to take a star awsy.",

I mean, that's why we came across town to Squid Ink in the first place, and this dude is getting a little greedy, don't you think?\"   But it didn't bother me. We just left, walked about 50 feet and found a Happy Hour that was actually happening. What struck me, though, is that I kind of feel bad for the owner for his lack of business acumen: save a couple of singles and one family, his restaurant was empty. All four or five of his sushi chefs were standing idle. What if he had embraced Happy Hour? What if he had corralled all of those Final Four passersby and brought them into his joint? What if he hadn't have gotten greedy and decided to cancel Happy Hour?",

We went here specifically because they had gluten free options, but what really ended up happening was that our waiter (over and over and over again) had to tell us that basically all of the things labeled gluten free weren't actually gluten free. I'm telling you it happened over 4x that what we ordered we couldn't have. Thank god our waiter was extremely knowledgeable.   Sushi was pretty lame as well. Very very very average.

We tried many things on the happy hour menu and enjoyed everything.  They had a photo booth that was fun to take pictures in.  Liked the bathroom - unisex concept and the one way windows in the door.  My second experience was horrible.  We were seated in the round booth and ignored for about 30 minutes.  I seriously thought about getting up and leaving.  Even after we were noticed the service did not improve.  The food was not on the same level as the first time - perhaps I was already grumpy from bad service?  Photo booth was gone...  Tried -   California Roll - daughter liked it so much she ordered a second serving Spicy Salmon Roll - just learning to like fish and the chunks of salmon were to big in this roll Miso Soup - delicious Cucumber Sunomono - so glad they make theirs with just cucumber.  the flavor was spot on. Roasted Garlic Edamame - so yummy with large chunks of garlic Agedashi Tofu - don't care for bonito so ordered it without second time Green Bean Tempura - good, fresh green beans but a bit to crunchy on the green bean.  Would have liked them blanched more before battering. Crab Rangoon - Great first trip.  To large chunks of crab second time for my preference. Beef Negimaki -  Very small portions.  Not visually appetizing to me.  First visit equals 5 stars. Second visit equals 1 star.  Torn on if I would try it a third time.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - B.O.B ft. Bruno Mars - Nothing On You)  Squid Ink Sushi, in downtown Phoenix I could be tasting, and my time is precious They got nothin on you, baby Nothin on you, baby  They might say Bo, and I might say Bites But you shouldn't worry, about what I'm saying Cause they got nothin on you, baby Nothin on you, baby  Literally the center of downtown Phoenix lies a sushi restaurant.  Yep, a sushi restaurant in the middle of a desert!  Hot as it may be; maybe it's heating up because of this place - wink!  Let us explore and enjoy!  My friend from Philly was in town and Bo Biting we went!  Ordered our drinks and went for the kill!  We started with some Agedashi Tofu; it was breaded with Panko and layed on a bed of smoky mirin soy sauce; overall a good start.  Next we went for it; spicy salmon roll, salmon roe, Pokemon roll, Flying Phoenix roll, and the Pan Seared Butterfish to top it off!  I didn't try the salmon roe since I usually don't care for it.  The first thing I notice and so did my partner was the rice was pretty darn good and well cooked. My favorite of the bunch was definitely the Pokemon roll; what seems to be a California roll topped with jalapeno, grilled onion and a grapefruit.  Second in line was the Flying Phoenix; crab roll topped with seared ahi, shrimp, and black pepper sauce drizzled all around.  We finished our entree with the butterfish which was beautifully plated.  It was served with grilled asparagus and fried onions and a very unique sauce; strawberry miso!  We finished the night was dessert of course and we went for the rice pudding brulee - OMG!  What a dessert; sticky rice, coconut milk, vanilla bean within a brown crusted sugar!  Where have you been in my short life!    Overall, a great experience!  Service was attentive and well trained while the place was very modern and sleek.  In the end, I must recommend a try! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "I came to grab dinner at this Japanese restaurant with fellow Yelper Kurdy S, and the experience was a big disappointment. I was initially impressed by the sleek, horizontal interior that included an outdoor patio, sushi bar, bar area, and a long stretch of booths and tables. The restaurant was relatively quiet considering the small and large groups of families that were dining there. They also have a few TVs for those eager to keep track of games and scores.  We ordered the Toyko Frites ($7) that came with shoestring fries sprinkled with seaweed and served with honey jalapeno and spicy aioli dips. The fries tasted rather ordinary and plain. The dips were very simplistic without hints of complexity. I don't think I would pay that much for fries to go with mayo-siracha dip.   The Assorted Sushi Platter ($18) came with eight pieces of spicy tuna roll, and nigiri that included unagi, ika, sake, tai, maguro, white fish, and ebi. The fish selection was ordinary and on the cheap side. The flavors were rather bland with dry spots, and I thought the red snapper had already turned.   I was particularly offended by my order of Ikura ($6) that was served half done! Apparently, the sushi chef had run out of salmon roe. He then had the audacity to serve a half way done Ikura and told me that I would be charged half the price for it. Presentation and precision are such a big part of the dining experience in Japanese cuisine. The restaurant should have let me know about this in advance and ask if there is anything else that I would rather have in its place. My face turned as red as the maguro when the order arrived at the table. I had the server to take it off the bill.  Service was grounded in Western paradigm and not very thoughtful at all. Prices were too inflated and the quality from food to service was sub par. I left in disappointment and will never want to come back here again.",

I prefer small rolls, the kind you can actually fit in your mouth and not have to awkwardly bite in half with chop sticks. I also had the green bean tempura, and the chicken wings which are chargrilled, bathed in siracha and served with shiso ranch. The star of the show was the miso black cod, pan seared and served with leeks, the miso glaze was intoxicating.   I couldn't believe how cheap the dinner and 2 sake bombers turned out to be.

    "text": "This is the type of sushi establishment that's more of a place to see and be seen than to enjoy a quality meal. That's why all the effort goes into a posh-looking bar. That's why the sushi has funny names (lol Pokemon Roll so kawaii) more memorable than quality.   Against my better judgment, I decided to go with a simple, tempura roll. The Vegas. It was executed quite poorly, as it was almost flavorless (how do you manage that when it has unagi?), and very gummy, indicating it was...uh...undercooked. Portion size was also questionable for the price, which would never bother me if the quality was at least average. I can legitimately say it's the worst Vegas roll I've ever had. I have had better sushi on several college campuses.   Next are the uninspired cocktails. Shiso leaf left untouched is a cool marketing tool to make a cocktail sound vaguely eastern, but it's neither flavorful nor aromatic enough when chilled to be anything more than an unfamiliar garnish in an otherwise forgettable libation. Only the \"City Escape\" stands out. Everything else is just a shot, some fruit juice, and some muddled \"seasonal\" fruit. How special can these drinks be if ingredients are strikingly interchangeable? Where is the cucumber? Lychee? I am disappointed. Oh, and the happy hour is pretty lame. IIRC, there's no reverse HH, something I'm more than happy to find down the road at 11pm.   A sushi bar that messes up sushi is already looking at 2-star territory. Atmosphere is nice and trendy, but that's negated by below average value. I'm still open to giving it another try someday, so I won't go any lower.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and really like this place.  In a sea of downtown bars full of TV sets and burgers, this is a nice island of relative tranquility.  Now at wintertime, you can look outside the window and see the skaters in CitySkate.  While there may be a TV at the bar, I don't see or hear it at any other table, and see nothing but their funky murals or other patrons enjoying a skillfully made meal.  I've generally just ordered sushi, which is presented without adornment on shiny white porcelain of different shapes.  Everything tastes nice and fresh, the nori is nice and crispy, and they are inventive with different combinations of house rolls.  Just don't expect to be in and out of here fast.  You generally can expect an hour's stay, even on a not-too-busy day.  But that's ok, good sushi should be savored, with the eyes and the mouth.    I once got green tea ice cream for dessert, and the serving was very generous...enough for 3 people.  The service is always friendly and professional.  Expect to pay a bit of money.  This is fresh fish in the desert, not a McDonald's hamburger.  Set your expectations accordingly and you won't be disappointed.",

I got the flying Phoenix and my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken. Let me just tell you this was the best sushi I had ever had. It was so good and fresh. And the garlic edamame wow! So so yummy!

Food and cocktails were honestly just mediocre, not good and not bad, but not memorable. I got a couple rolls and one cocktail, and didn't think much of anything I got.   What I do remember was the great service! We were in a pretty large group, and they got all our orders correct. They were also really nice in giving us separate bills, and everything was accurate.

When you personally have to get up and go find someone for a refill, an item they missed, or ask for the check it's super frustrating. Not to mention incredibly awkward staring at the table waiting, looking around hoping to get anybody's attention. Just because we weren't a large party or ordering alcohol doesn't mean we're any less of a priority.   The food was also lackluster. I've ordered Dragon Rolls at many sushi restaurants in the valley and never has it ever come with shrimp (which is why I ordered it and they don't make you aware that it does) I guess they are trying to be unique because two of the pieces come with a fried shrimp tail which I wasn't a fan of so I removed it only to see that there was nothing else filled inside, just a gaping hole. So for a $14 roll two of the pieces were basically just seaweed and rice. The pieces are small as it is so this felt like a complete waste of money but by the time our waiter bothered to stop by and ask how everything was it was way too late and I was ready to leave.  For our first time experience, SquidInk left us with a horrible first impression and quite literally a bad taste in our mouths. I won't be returning and wouldn't recommend to anyone. If you are planning on a romantic dinner or a nice night out I'd look elsewhere, there are plenty of other restaurants in walking distance and it seems like the poor service we received is consistent among other reviews.",

The happy hour is amazing, 4 - 7 and reverse from 10 - midnight, half off appetizers and drink specials, try the specialty cocktail, the \"Deep Water\", it's delicious and the happy hour price is $5.    You can hit Squid Ink before the game and still get the happy hour prices, unlike the places close to the ballpark who suspend their happy hours on game day or during special events, which is super lame.    Come down during the holiday season and enjoy looking at the ice skating rink, it's really nice.

I'd definitely order that again. For my main dish, I ordered the duck confit bowl, but the server returned to inform me that duck wouldn't be available for another two hours. That was a bummer, but there were still plenty of other appealing choices. I went with the Beef Short Rib Bowl.  The restaurant was really filling up at this point but our food didn't take long to come out. I loved my dish. The beef short ribs had an amazing and deep flavor; the only negative is that a few of the pieces were really large and awkward to eat with chopsticks. The flavors within my bowl contrasted and complemented each other well, from the freshness of the rice to the acidic tang of the kimchi to the softness of the egg. Great stuff all around.  I've already told my husband that he needs to come here with me sometime when we're in downtown. Maybe then I can try the duck... and that macadamia nut bread pudding...",

You might be thinking why would you get chicken wings at a sushi place? They were recommended by a friend and they were to die for. The sauce was amazing, the meat was tender, and the ranch dipping sauce was awesome! My wife and her friend got some sushi and said it was okay but nothing to go out of your way for. The star here is based solely on my experience.  Star 2 is for the service. Our waitress always made sure we had what we needed and were taken care of.  Star 3 is for the atmosphere. The atmosphere here is a very cool place to hang out with a group. It is set up in a cool way and there is pretty loud music playing the whole time. It's not some place I would go on an intimate date because I would get way too distracted but it was fun to go with my wife and her friend.  Star 4 is for the food being worth the price. We went in during happy hour which is from 3 to 7 every day! So I got a full order of amazing wings for 7 bucks.  Star 5 is for the wow factor. The wow factor here is for how great the wings were at a sushi place. I would go here again just for the wings.",

I am a big fan of octopus, but this wasn't my favorite octopus. The spice was great but the octopus was a little too chewy for my taste. The beef negamaki was much better with a sauce that had a great kick to it.",

FYI all appetizers are half off for happy hour and Tuesdays are half off wine bottles from 7 pm to close. It's a great place to take your friends. And it's in the heart of downtown. The patio is a great place for people watching...  I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of opprtunistic flies hovering which was annoying. But they were gone after a few minutes. No big.",

However, our only server on the patio was the bartender, who was very busy. So we waited a while for things like water refills. There is no way for her to access the patio without walking all the way around the other side through the restaurant. Not bad if you are sitting at the bar, but not so good if you are sitting at one of the tables. You guys should really split the bar open for access to the patio.   The food was not bad. I got the ramen. I've been to some really good ramen places, and this was just ok. Not the best I've had. My fiancee liked her sushi. The tempura beans were good, but some on the greasy side.   I honestly would give this place another go if some friends wanted to go there, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   Great concept, just needs some polishing.",

I highly suggest trying to go during their happy hour. They have great deals on food and drinks. If you don't go during happy hour it can get a bit spendy. This place usually requires a reservation if you are coming for dinner hours and I can see why. Space is limited. They did a good job with what they have. If you don't have a reservation expect to wait. The only con in my opinion is that the menu had no description of what the rolls were. I had to ask the waiter. That's a minor inconvenience though.",

We spent weeks promoting them to our members, and when we began to arrive, the staff was completely clueless in regards to any promotion and there was no themed roll made for us.

I didn't come here to eat at In-And-Out to serve my own water.  But this is exactly what Squid Ink did.  I sat around and around and around to get my own menus, get my own refills of water, annoy 3 different waiters/waitresses for an order and get my own check.  I honestly have no idea who the heck my waiter was that day.  That is just poor service.  I honestly think some of the workers there are somewhat judgmental too.  They completely ignored me.  I do think it's because of the way I dressed.  It reminds me of going into a luxury car dealership wearing shorts and a t-shirt, there is no help, or any desire to help.  The hostesses didn't even take me to the seat at the bar, they just pointed and told me it was free seating.  Have some proper service or even a smile on your face, it's not even that hard to walk 3 steps to make a customer feel welcomed.    The food is great though if you don't care about service.  In fact, the sushi is one of the best I've tasted and they deserve every recognition from all the magazines and food critics.  Easily a 5 star sushi place.  But the service was so atrocious when I went that I am very hesitant to give them another shot.  Or I can probably try to not look poor.",

I love the shape and the crispy textures. It may be weird that they chop crab up instead of the traditional mixture but it works. It's a great appetizer.   I've had a few of their sushi rolls but this time I got the nigiri. It was a little bit larger than other nigiri I've had but I didn't mind.  So in the 90s, Breyer's had an ice cream called Fruit Rainbow. The Green Tea ice cream tastes KINDA like it before your mouth goes numb. It's like nostalgia in a little cup. I'll be back always just for it!",

The spicy tuna roll was not great but not bad either.  The experience fell apart with the tempura roll.  The roll was made with hot tempura shrimp which heated the roll and changed the consistency of the rice and the taste of the cold tuna.  Unfortunately this prohibited me from finishing.",

I ordered the assorted sushi platter for dinner and was just filled. Don't get me wrong, I was filled and satisfied but I am looking for something that will kick me off and say, \"You must not forget me!\" -- that thing.

Not only did we get seated in a comfy booth but the wait staff were all extremely friendly. They have happy hour starting at 3pm and it includes the same bombs which we all got one each! Definitely enough to share if you don't want to get day drunk.  My favorite sushi was definitely the Tahoe. It's soft shell crab fried and it was super flavorful. If you're into crab that's definitely the roll to get.   Every roll we got was fresh. Even the vegetarian roll that just had avocado. My friend Beth was not into sushi but she tried the rolls I got which was also spicy tuna and she loved it.  We also got the fried string beans as an appetizer also on the happy hour menu. It was delightful and light. I could eat them like chips.  All in all a great experience with great staff and delicious food.",

    "text": "Squid and Ink is beautiful to look at  and in a convenient location.  I enjoyed their decor and wall paintings, overall a very nice and original setting.  The food would get a B.  Passable but not great,    All the house rolls are on the higher price point, and although the combinations sounded interesting, the prices scared me away. I ended up having the lunch special which comes with one roll and an assortment of nigiris. The fish was fresh and the roll was rather standard  The miso soup which was included on the lunch special was off-putting, the broth did not have a lot of flavor and the mushrooms were crunchy and felt dehydrated.     I decided to try one of the rice bowls  and went with the one with salmon. On the positive side: it seems super healthy and packed with veggies, but it kind of lacks any flavor or excitement. The salmon is grilled, not fresh and felt a bit over cooked. There is no sauce or anything offered to spice up the dish and I  felt like i was just chewing on unseasoned boiled broccoli.   Would probably check out a different location for sushi the next time",

Place was packed, 20-25 minute wait (concert night I recommend getting here a little early)  After about 12 minutes a couple of seats opened up at the bar and we were lucky enough to grab them.  Couple of ice cold beers, Edemame, and we ordered the Cougar and Dirty RockStar.  The sushi was soooo awesome.    Sam was our bartender/server and she was fantastic.  She was super prompt, helped explain the two different sushi's that we ordered.    Met Mario the manager and he was super helpful when we signed in.  We try to come here and eat before every event downtown.  Double  UP...",

Atmosphere was great the booths and seating is good I like all the decoration and artwork. The restrooms are interesting as well. At first I thought the music may be too loud but once inside it's actually a good volume  I got the chef lunch sushi special which came with salmon tuna shrimp and albacore than a spicy crab roll and miso soup I added a Philadelphia roll as well. My son got the kids chicken and noodle and some miso. I have to say overall food was good. My issue is the rice was a lot and not much flavor didn't have enough vinegar. He after getting his food didn't want the noodles and chicken but that's a toddler for u. Miso was delicious Philadelphia roll wasn't bad but all I tasted was rice and bland rice.  Server was nice very helpful. Overall not a bad sushi place.",

We were seated right away and the vibe was great! Not too crazy, not too crowded and not crazy loud music. We ordered off of the happy menu, which was a great selection of a little bit of everything as well as a really good drink menu! I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place, the service was also really good, and attentive! The crab rangoons were delish as well as the spicy crab off of the happy menu! Probably one of the best spicy crab rolls I've ever Hade! The tempura green beans were sooo delish along with the dipping sauce as well! Honestly our food was great, and drinks! The manager Mario came by our table to check in and he was so nice and it was very meaningful to have him check in on us, he even took the time to take our picture! Overall, I would highly recommend this spot and we will be going back again soon!!",

When we arrived, the manager met us at the door and set us up in a nice private booth. He even started our drink order and served them himself and then gave some recommendations of what he enjoyed eating. My husband got the double baked wings and fries. He stated \"These wings are the best I've had in a long time, and the fries are really good too!\" For a sushi place, wings are the last thing one would probably try, but they were delicious! I got a few classic rolls like the spicy tuna and the Philadelphia roll. I loved every bite!! We definitely plan on returning again. Thank you Squid Ink for a great night!",

I do not eat sushi but everyone else does. That being said the crab ragoons were very good, the pot stickers were good as well. I decided to order a beef rib rice bowl. I can't review on that because well... it never came. I ordered and then all the food came. I ask the server again and he said he will go check on it. The tab was paid and were ready to leave and all the waiter said he didn't know what happened to it. So needless to say, I did not eat. However, the drinks were good. It took a while to get our drinks too, but they were good. Everyone else said the sushi was good.",

    "text": "Nestled in the hustle and bustle of downtown Phoenix lies Squid Ink. An upscale, overly hyped and over priced restaurant where the sushi lacks inspiration and the cocktails elicit a \"meh\". But good effort. It makes me feel like I'm the kind of boujee who could afford the $13 Deep Water cocktail because it was presented in a martini glass. But don't get me wrong. It was still pretty good. As was the garlic edamame and Japanese fried chicken. Do I want to pay $11 again for the chicken appetizer? No.   The sushi rolls are over priced for what they are. They don't taste any differently than, say, your typical grocery store sushi you pick up on the way home after a hard work day. You knowingly buy it, and you understand that it's not some burst of flavor or a sudden meld of ingredients meant to be when you taste the first piece. It's a mediocre fix to the sushi cravings you don't have time to sit down for and attend to at an upscale restaurant. So what's the excuse at Squid Ink? The philly roll-a simple, ordered more times for those who like to play it safe kind of roll - fell flat. I didn't think it was possible. It's just fish and cream cheese. What's so hard about it? Dousing your dragon rolls in eel sauce doesn't make it better. The $14 Tahoe roll had a weird texture. Adding fried crab in it doesn't make it better. Again, where is the flavor?   What turned the experience more south for me was the ramen. My god. I think it's an insult to add this to your menu. The broth was bland, the soft boiled egg had no...flavor. There wasn't anything to it except that it was just...an egg. I can't really explain it. It was an egg but it wasn't a good egg. The bean sprouts did nothing to contribute to the dish and is just a waste of an ingredient. To add insult to the injury that is the ramen, we pay an extra $5 for 3 pieces of pork belly. Although the meat was tender, it could not save the broth. And the broth is everything. It's what MAKES your ramen delicious. I get it. You're a sushi restaurant. You're not tailored to make ramen, but don't add it to the menu and expect patrons to be satisfied paying $15 for a bowl of disappointment. We're already paying $14 for speciality rolls that weren't that great to begin with. Did I eat all the components in the ramen? Darn right I did. I paid $15 for that bowl.   On the plus side, your lighting is awesome during the day for food photo ops.",

To start it was a circular table that had a huge rotating lazy susan in the middle, so we could share our food. That was such a genius idea!  That had a ton of cocktails for women and men. My favorite was the Tokoyo something, it was a perfect mix of citrus and sweet! The service and food were great and timely.   I will definitely go back here for sushi next time I go down town.",

    "text": "The BF and I went to the grand opening last night and I was pretty impressed. This restaurant/bar has a nice modern vibe and an extensive menu of hot items and sushi. We sat on the patio where the misters were out of control (read: it felt like it was a rainy day and we were just barely under an awning....not that this was a bad thing). We ended up sharing a few items including: Cucumber rolls (pretty standard), buffalo chicken roll (this was ridiculously good...the buffalo sauce was spicy and delicious, the chicken was crunchy, it was a definite winner), and the kobe burger with Tokyo fries (the burger was good, it had caramelized onions and spicy aioli on it and came on some kind of flatbread....definitely tasty...they cooked it a little over what we ordered it at, but it was still tasty. Additionally, they forgot to give us the fries, but when I told our waiter he got them for us, so no problem there. The fries were good, nice and crispy and they had been fried in fish oil so they had a slight fish taste to them....but in a good way).  We also had a few drinks, that were all tasty. I had the deep water, which tasted like a jolly rancher, but not in that weird synthetic way some drinks like that may taste, but in a fresh way. It was very good. I also tried the revolver which had a delicious ginger flavor. The BF had whiskey sours which were on special for only 3$ (awesome!) and they were also tasty. Overall, there were a few snags, but it was good. I will definitely try them again.",

The drink menu was nice and varied with attention to not only specialty cocktails but also having a decent selection of more pedestrian fare.  However, this is a sushi bar and it all relies on the fish and rice.  And here is where it swings downhill quickly.  The fish used for nigiri was dry.  Even when it came out you could see that it was lacking a sheen of freshness.  The rice used complimented the dry fish.  It was typically a lump of poorly formed rice that seemed to have all the life sucked out of it.  I cannot recommend this place for sushi.  Rolls were good and we did not try any of the non-fish fare.",

I spoke with the manage and he told me that my money would be back on my account today (Monday) I was there on Friday, so today I still show the 2 charges on my bank acct so I called the restaurant and the manager I spoke with said it will be 3-5 business days!

The drinks were on par, (in regards to both quality and pricing), with other mid to upscale restaurants in the area.   Bottom line: this is your typical Asian-fusion sushi restaurant, enjoy if you're in the area but don't go out of your way to try it out or you may be disappointed.",

When the sushi arrived we didn't have chopsticks, plates, napkins - I had to walk up front and get them myself.  The food was...ok.  Nothing really stood out about it.  I tried 3 different rolls and they were all pretty good...not bad, but not GREAT either.  Pricing wasn't too bad...3 rolls and edamame for like $45.

In summary, you feel like you've been there enjoying a nice lunch for awhile but in reality, you're in and out before your lunch hour's up! Located right in the heart of Downtown Phoenix at CityScape, this is a perfect spot for lunchtime delight. They offer lunch specials which are very reasonably priced and come with a cup of Miso soup. During a lunch here, I enjoyed the Spicy Tuna lunch special which came with delicious spicy tuna, tempura eggplant, rice and other veggies.

I have frequented Squid Ink since it opened at the Palomar Hotel/City Scape complex. I have, unfortunately, experienced a slow downward spiral for this restaurant in quality of food, preparation of fish and service.  If I had written this 3 years ago, I would have provided a much higher score, but that's irrelevant.  Food: The sushi quality and roll choices are just OK. Nothing too creative nor palate pleasing. I've had just about every roll on the menu and none are keepers. Sashimi is decent grade but many times dry, tasteless or overly fishy tasting.   Service: Warning: if you are seated at the bar, expect to be patient as the wait to get water, drinks and food is excessive. Typically ONE bartender is servicing the entire restaurant and wait staff as well as hostessing and tending to the bar patrons. It just plain sucks if you're at the bar. It didn't help the matter that I got \"chair bombed\" not once, but twice by two separate patrons who felt the need to sit directly next to me when there were other seats open at the bar. Weird!!!  I'm sad to see this place slide downhill. And now that the food has been consistently mediocre and overpriced, I simply have to find another go-to sushi place. Not an easy task downtown.",

The decor is modern and clean.  Good music hums in the background...Kindof techno-y, but it fits the atmosphere and isn't annoying.  The Husband and I went on a Monday afternoon around 5pm and there was hardly anyone there.  We sat on the outside portion of the bar which has two TVs and it was nice and breezy outside. My only complaint was the city bus stop right in front of the restaurant, it was pretty noisy, but that's downtown livin for ya! :) The rolls were tasty.  We had the shrimp tempura, spicy crab, the vegas roll and a california roll.  I loved the shrimp tempura roll and the spicy crab was my next favorite.  The Husband thought they were all pretty good.  I'm definitely not a sushi connoisseur, (I've only been eating it for about 4 years), but I've had better quality sushi.  This however was still tasty and I enjoyed my experience.  Will definitely go back when I'm in the area.",

I ordered the surf and turf roll and my oh my was that filling! Unlike what my colleague ordered.. the crab hand roll...what a waste. It was mediocre, at best. I also ordered some edamame, which you can't really mess up lol the portion is rather large so feel free to share those. Now in regards to grading, they get three stars from me solely because the service wasn't that awesome... they forgot to bring our soup, brought dishes out at completely different times, so the awkward tension of should I eat my food now or starve until everyone has their food arose and there wasn't anything spectacular about this spots...just your average sushi restaurant. Definitely not a top five in my book. Would I go back? Probably not.",

As soon as the last piece of roll left the plate, the plate was immediately removed.  Like I said, the food we ordered was very tasty, but the experience as a whole was just mediocre.

As it turned out, the garlic ranch was pretty awesome, and the wings fell off the bone.  They were extremely tasty as well.  Needless to say, quite a nice surprise.  The burger was fantastic as well.  Not a huge selection of beers, about 5 in total but the pumpkin kilt lifter and IPA were good.

I went there on a busy Friday night and got my staple of Miso Soup, Flying Fish Roe, and Salmon.  The presentation was wonderful, everything had a very clean atmosphere. The food was delicious but not the best I've ever had. The Miso Soup looked tastier than it actually was, but it was still a 4/5.   While I found that the service was very quick, it was a bit too much. I had several different people at least 2 different waiters coming over to me asking how my food was. It was delicious but there's a fine art to service and asking if I need anything between gulps isn't going to win over the casual diner.  The price was actually cheaper than one would expect from a Sushi place downtown. Perhaps the presentation let me to believe it would be more expensive than it actually was. While that's a good thing for the consumer, it might turn away prospective customers.  I'm still looking for great sushi restaurants in the Phoenix area, but for the price and location there's very little that Squid Ink Sushi does incorrectly.",

Even though we planned on staying for a while to conduct some business the wait staff was very attentive. Unlike many places in which the servers seem to disappear after bringing you your order, my water glass was never empty and they continued through the afternoon to ask if we needed anything else right up until the end.  I am not a sushi fanatic but I am learning to enjoy it more and more with each trip. That being said the sushi was so delicious.  I tried a spicy yellowtail roll which actually wasn't spicy at all and a squid nagiri.  The roll was great and so were the others I sampled.  I wasn't as impressed with the squid nagiri as it was a bit too chewy. Even though it's not sushi I would love to go back and try their Kobe burger.",

All of the house rolls are amazing, especially the surf n turf, and the miso soup is very delicious. They have a lunch special and happy hour, so make sure you check it out! They also provide an industry discount, which is pretty dang awesome, if you ask me.",

I got the impression they get a large late night crowd that doesn't care if it's bad or not, it's food and sake. They sat me outside at a table on the rail that was so close to the sidewalk, people were walking right by the table.  I only thing I liked was Sapporro on draft. What I didn't like was the dirty spoon they served with my Miso soup. When the waiter brought me a regular silver spoon and said, \"here you go\" without an apology, I knew it would be the last time I'd be here. The food was just ok, but if you go, bring your own silverware.",

Especially the management they are so great and always come by to check on how I'm doing and anything I might need . I believe the bartending is a job that requires exceptional customer service skills along with a friendly welcoming attitude. I hope management gets opportunity to read  this review because things like that make people either want to come back or not. Thank you .

I got the Tuna Galore (some roll called something like that), Mackerel Nigiri, and the sushi lunch special that came with Spicy Crab roll, and Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail and Shrimp Nigiri. The fish was good! standard fish but they give you really thick generous cuts. The Tuna Galore was awesome and they use cucumber to wrap it so no other flavors overpower the tuna.   This place is a westernized modern restaurant that serves good sushi. It's not your traditional chef sushi bar restaurant so if you are looking for that go somewhere else.",

Amazing service, delicious sushi, and great drinks! Only downside is it is a little pricey, but the quality makes this worth the visit.   While here we've ordered the Flying Phoenix, Spicy Tuna roll, the sushi lunch platter, the seaweed salad, miso soup, and Hory Fook roll. ALL of which were wonderful! During a prior visit I also tried their wings and Kobe burger, the wings were fantastic ... Though I don't think I would order the burger again. It was not bad, but just not as good in comparison to the rest of their menu.   If you go here be sure to check-in and get 50% off your first draft beer. You will not be disappointed!  Just be prepared to pay at least around $25-$40 per person.",

Only interested in the single girl and talking about how much money he made in old town and getting drugs on the dark web. Food was okay: rockstar roll was really good very spicy! Seafood dynamite roll was terrible, we already paid so good ol Lou did not offer much in terms of compensation other than \"we'll find this a good home\" as he took our uneaten roll away. Which in my understanding of restaurant terms means us employees are gonna smash this in the back. He offered us a free beer in place of the $15 roll. We were ready to leave and declined the beer so he said next time we come in to remind him of this incident and he would \"hook us up\". I'm a manager at a sushi restaurant and this is just ridiculously terrible all around. Poor service ruins the experience. If the food was great I would have looked over Lou's short comings but unfortunately this was not the case.  I will absolutely never come back to squid ink.",

The decor was very nice, clean, & modern and our server was great.  We opted to sit at the sushi bar and ordered a yellowtail roll, tuna roll, garlic edamame, and beef & broccoli. The sushi rolls were good, but a little pricey at $7 per roll. The garlic edamame was very flavorful. However, the beef & broccoli was pretty disappointing. While the beef & broccoli were cooked perfectly, it was pretty much ruined by the sauce. The sauce was way too sweet, and the dish was drowning in it.   Cooked dishes don't seem to be their forte, and the sushi is little bit pricier and no better than a few other sushi places in Phoenix. So I will most likely only return for happy hour, as their regular priced options are not a very good value.",

I'll admit we went there just to get the Yelp deal (50% off draught beer), but it turned out to be an awesome dining experience. Out for drinks morphed into full-fledged late-night meal.   The service was great). Very attentive, friendly (but not pushy), and knowledgeable  (in spite of our server being new there).  The food was wonderful. We had a party of 4 and ordered a variety dishes and rolls, none of which disappointed. Dragon Roll is especially delicious. And we HAD to try the Tootsie roll (just because) and it turned out to be surprisingly yummy and not just a cute name!  Their selections of cold sake are come sable too (tho I can't possibly remember which ones we had)... The details are fuzzy now... But that is a GOOD sign when it comes to the quality of the alcoholic beverages, doesn't it?!  Overall, I highly recommend this place ANY time of the day, but for SURE as a fantastic late option.",

The broth is complex. Add some sriracha and it gets more complex. Open the soft boiled egg to let the yolk mix and you're seriously golden. The levels in this dish are indeterminable, at least to my palate, and they are oh so varied.   Let's talk about the location now. NE corner of Central and Jefferson. Critics will say what they will about the Cityscape development, but this spot they nailed. Most of the restaurant looks out onto the street so you've got the train passing by regularly. Kiddy-corner you'll find the Luhrs Buidling - one of the best structures to look at in the downtown core. Long story short, Squid Ink has one of THE most prime locations.   The murals inside... shut your hole if you dislike them in any way. They create exactly what I want in an establishment: character. The interior is spot-on, from the booths/tables to the liquor bar and the sushi bar.   Yes, parking can be tricky. Cityscape has a garage with multiple entry points but I can't confirm if Squid Ink validates. But it has multiple levels of parking either way. For anyone that doesn't live downtown, perhaps it's time to reconsider your geography.   Summary - YES!",

Delicious, good sized, and the variety of rolls we can try is excellent.  The only off-putting thing about my vegetarian roll was that it included tempura asparagus and cream cheese. I'm under the general assumption that, if I'm ordering something with strictly vegetables, it won't have anything fried in it, and it will mention if it includes a dairy product. So I was a bit disappointed by this. However, I ate it, and it was good - just not what I expected, or wanted at that moment.",

Originally, I was going to go to another sushi joint which I will not name here cause I don't want to start a sushi rivalry but the other joint was closed on New Year Day.   As it turns out, it was a blessing in disguise since Squid Ink is located right next to the ice skating rink so we were able to have dinner then walk right over to go skating- so convenient!  We had quite a feast.  Chicken teriyaki bowl for my son, chicken teriyaki noodle for his friend, edamame, shisito peppers, 3 California rolls, 1 spicy Salmon roll, miso cod.  Oh, did you think the rolls were for me?    Of course not!  My growing boy ate his chicken teriyaki bowl then proceeded to eat the California rolls and the spicy salmon roll. After some gentle reminders, I did get a few pieces from each of the different rolls.   It's a good thing when my son heartily eats (since for a young'n, he has a pretty good palate) and we are fighting,hmm I mean sharing happily our sushi!  Michele M. who also joined us for dinner ordered gyoza, fried tofu, California roll, fried shrimp tempura roll also enjoyed her selections.   My fav out of them all was the miso cod. 4 thin slices, perfectly cooked so the cod was still tender and moist. Hmmm, just thinking about it makes me what to have it again.  Service is amicable. Staff friendly. Glad to have come here- and will come again!",

Squid Ink seems really hip and the young wait staff might enforce that opinion, but I haven't felt more comfortable watching college football in a restaurant that didn't have pitchforks on the walls in a long time.   The seating arrangements are a little goofy, but doable. Like most sushi places if you're a group of two, you should sit at the bar.   The prices are certainly reasonable (some might say you're almost stealing it, considering the abysmal quality of many sushi joints here, which pop up like Subways or McDonalds now.) for what you get.   They also have fresh ground wasabi available, which is a continued rarity. Good stuff. Go for the happy hour, stay because you got drunk and need more salmon.",

The most recent visit they sat us down at a dirty table and served us a cold las Vegas roll which is normally cooked and warm. Dissapointed with the second experience as the place has a great set up with a cool vibe. I'm sure we will be back but talk is there is another sushi place downtown that's all about giving you a great experience and great food period. Try the ultimate Philly roll and the surf n turf.",

It is located in the Cityscape area. Behind Tilted Kilt. Next to Ice Arena for anyone trying to figure out where it is at.   I was extremely impressed with service and food. Had too many rolls to remember. The sashimi platter had several different cuts of great fish.   Pricing was very comparable to what I have experienced at many other locations.   The bottled beer choices were a little disappointing. I enjoy the Japanese Beers and they had limited.  Would love to see them expand this part of menu.   Got so involved, so quickly, we forgot to take photos.   This will be a regular for downtown.  Looking forward to my next trip downtown to return.  Would also be a great place to sit outside before baseball game and watch light rail go by..",

Next time you are downtown for a ball game, or an event taking place, or maybe even a stroll be sure you stop by Squid Ink.",

    "text": "I picked up a takeout sushi order here when I was visiting on business.  I'm a huge fan of creative, fusion rolls so I was immediately drawn to the House Rolls.  I will admit I was a little disappointed there wasn't a wider range (a lot of the rolls seem to use a lot of the same ingredients in different configurations), but I was intrigued by the Dirty Rockstar and Ultimate Phily so I ended up ordering both of them along with a seaweed salad.  Pricing seemed fair for these kind of items.  With each dish there were things I liked and things that just seemed off to me.  In the seaweed salad the seaweed itself was tasty but there was just an odd flavor to the daikon radish.  With the Dirty Rockstar I enjoyed the flavor overall but the sweet chili sauce was too cloying and didn't meld well with the other flavors.  With the Ultimate Philly I really enjoyed the taste at first but there was just a very odd flavor at the end of the taste that lingered into a bad after taste I didn't care for.  I actually left a few pieces of sushi behind and I'm usually someone who loves sushi to the point of overeating.  Overall, this was just okay.  It was a step up from ordering room service but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again if I were regularly in the area.",

The decor and interior of the restaurant is very awesome which makes this place a great place to hangout however the food falls short.  Tried several rolls, poke style bowl and ramen. The dishes are a little deceiving as they look beautifully presented and ingredients are fresh, but they lack in flavor and in the case of the ramen it seemed they tossed ingredients into a bowl but none of it seemed to come together. Bland taste throughout all the dishes.  On a funny side the ramen came in an enormous bowl (the kind you might use for salads at home)!!  In regards to the service, it was definitely not the best.",

Squid's located in the heart of downtown and has a pretty decent happy hour. The theme for our night that night was sweet chili sauce. We started off with the crab rangoons as appetizers and they were delicious- they had real crab in them and dipped in the sweet sauce, it was the perfect combination.  It was hard to choose, but I finally decided to order the Dirty Rockstar roll. The presentation was amazing! The red chili sauce seemed to go on forever, and with the jalepeno, it was a fusion of sweet and spicy that I absolutely loved!  For my cocktail, I even tried a pear-apple-flavored cocktail that reminded me of fall. It was amazing to have the flavors transport me back to the East Coast.  As always the fish is always fresh and the flavors are great. They are under new management as of a few months ago, and this is the first time we ate with the new management. Cheers to them - I love the direction they are going in.",

It was a slow night due to local construction but Greg and Grayson served me well, and had me laughing and enjoying every bit of my time there by small talks and sharing stories.   Review for the food : Sushi and edamame are my favorite Japanese food and theirs, absolutely kept my appetite open. Although many on the menu I had never have, Grayson gave me a great intro of their best selling Sushi's. And I enjoyed what he recommended like no where else. It was a enjoyable experience!",

    "text": "Solid sushi establishment. Good sushi, good service, awesome Sunday happy hour specials, and a unique atmosphere.  I've definitely had better sushi before, but this place definitely deserves credit for fresh and tasty sushi. The two rolls I tried (Philly Roll & Spicy Salmon Roll) were good and totally worth what I paid. Philly Roll was a little heavy on the cream cheese, but they both tasted really fresh, which is always a definite plus at sushi restaurants. I also tried the pot stickers. Presentation was a five - they looked amazing - but, again, they weren't the best I've had and they had much thicker dough than what I prefer.  A negative I had with this place was that the seating outside is actually right next to all of the people walking on the sidewalk, and the table heights put you directly at the height of the people waking by. Weirdly, three guys came up to our table while we were talking & eating and stopped to talk about their beliefs for what was probably five minutes. It was uncomfortable and a weird situation, and the waiter didn't come to distract us so they'd stop talking. (Not sure if he should have or what could have been done to prevent this, but it was uncomfortable and didn't really leave me in a good spot with the layout of the place and ability to be in a private, date-night setting.)  Still overall great service and good sushi. Would likely return if I was in the area, but would probably try to sit inside.",

    "text": "Cosmopolitan sushi spots aren't hard to find in the valley.  Heck, you can find well over a dozen trendy fashion forward sushi spots just within a 5 mile radius of Downtown Phoenix.  The atmospherics can certainly be tantalizing, but sadly too often the sushi itself is not.  Places like Hana and Harumi Sushi are two of my valley favorites for sushi mainly because the focus is on the product, not on the aesthetics.  Squid Ink is a west valley sushi spot which opened a second location in Downtown Phoenix a couple of years back.  I've passed by it countless times on my way to a ballgame or downtown event.  But for sushi, I've almost always gone up the road to Harumi.  But on a Sunday for lunch, I decided I'd give Squid Ink a shot.  Located in the Cityscape development on the northeast corner of Central & Jefferson, Squid Ink's Downtown location strives for a look of urban sheik even before you walk in the door.  Ample street side patio seating outside, with options for seating at the sushi bar, their drink bar, in a booth, at a table, or even a high table against the window as I chose.  Altogether I'd guess the restaurant can seat at least 100 at capacity in this long (somewhat narrow) space.  The interior itself reminds me of a number of trendy sushi spots I've been to in the Scottsdale and Paradise Valley areas.  Its a look that's certainly pleasant to the eye, but does the food match the atmosphere?  Valley chef (and Scottsdale Culinary Institute grad) Schuyler Estes is the proprietor of this business and has honed his craft at valley restaurants like Christopher's, Cowboy Ciao, Four Peaks Brewery, as well as numerous Asian seafood restaurants.  How does his rendition stack up against a myriad of competitors?    Things got off to a rather rocky start when I went to use my Yelp check in for half off a draft beer, but the waitress told me they don't honor that on Sundays.  Odd.  There's nothing on the Yelp check in that states that condition.  Nevertheless the waitress was insistent that they won't honor it today.  Welp, dock off one star for that.  Let's hope the rest of the meal is a better experience.  Sushi is certainly the mainstay here, but the menu also features a fairly robust selection of apps and some decent lunch specials.    For my app, I went with an order of their potstickers.  Five pork dumplings covered in scallions, ginger, and soy sauce.  They also threw in free miso soup alongside.  The potstickers were super tasty.  Plenty of pork inside and the potstickers had a nice smooth clean skin on the outside.  The miso soup was also quite good with a tasty broth, though I think they went way overboard with the number of mushrooms they put in the soup.  Note to Squid Ink: less mushrooms, more miso broth.  For the main course, I went with the sushi lunch special.  A chefs selection of a sushi roll, 4 pieces of nigiri and sides of ginger and wasabi.  I honestly couldn't say with 100% certainty which fish the chef choose, though I'm fairly certain my roll was the Spicy Crab roll.  All of the fish were plated perfectly for easy chopstick pickup (no forks here unless you ask, and I didn't ask).  All the fishes were delish and the lunch portion is pretty healthy.  Still hungry, I went a little off the reservation and ordered their Rice Pudding Brulee for dessert.  They mix vanilla ice cream, coconut milk and sticky rice together, then cover it with a creme brulee style brown sugar crust and seasonal fruit (in this case, strawberries).  An unexpected dish to be sure but I actually really loved the rice mixture.  I think the coconut milk in particular helped to mellow the rice in a such a way that the cold chunky texture was more pleasant.  Total cost for all the food including tax and tip came to about $40.  A pretty reasonable price for all the food I got, all things considered.  As mentioned earlier, I can't give them a perfect score mainly due to the Yelp check in snafu (if you're going to advertise a free check in special on Yelp to lure customers in, you'd better honor it if there's no restrictions listed).  I would still say Harumi is my favorite of the numerous Downtown sushi spots as I'm a fan of the no frills places that dish out high quality stuff.  But if you're looking for a spot with good sushi, good happy hour specials and an urban sheik atmosphere, Squid Ink has you covered (particularly at lunch time).  I've had fantastic sushi, and I've had God awful sushi.  For me, Squid Ink falls somewhere in the upper middle echelon.",

    "text": "I was in the downtown area and decided to go in to squid ink yesterday as it was national sushi day. Went in for their happy hour which is daily from 3:00pm-7:00pm. I was not impressed with the happy hour items they don't have a great selection and the prices on the happy hour menu are still pretty high. I ordered the Vegas roll and the rainbow roll $10 each. They were both tasty and enjoyable. The service was okay only two other tables in at the time we went. I am unsure if I will be returning or heading over to Hana or Nori next time I am in the mood for sushi. Overall it's a nice place downtown to hang out, very modern decor and nice colors. Just not my cup of tea.",

We got the BLVD (white fish + king crab - decent), spicy tuna roll (delicious), crab rangoon (very good), edamame (very good), cucumber sunonomo (okay).    We had better sushi at other places but the location is convenient.  We had a good time despite the place being kinda hot (not sure why).  We were both literally sweating the entire time.",

Another thing is that we had to ask for a refill  on drinks when I good restaurant would know to refill drinks before you're done with it. We also asked for extra ice in our drinks twice and still didn't get it. Also our cold sushi was hot and our hot sushi was cold. One more thing is that they had the sun's game on and the whole staff was just staring at it not paying any attention to the customers. The one good thing about the place was the hostess was extremely nice.",

I got the Ramen bowl, which on the menu said it came with poached egg but it actually came with a soft-boiled egg. This totally was not an issue for me because I love soft boiled eggs but I just wanted to point it out. Everything else in it was delicious and the bowl was a large portion for what I paid! My pals got rice bowls and they reported that they were super filling and tasty. We also split a bread pudding and our bread pudding pro of the group said it was some of the best she's had. Interior is super trendy and the vibe was really fun and upbeat. I thought it was perfect! 4 stars because of the egg and because service was a bit slow for how empty the restaurant was, but everything else was absolutely fantastic. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be a regular here.",

We ordered a salmon roll and a crab roll and split the ramen (pork belly and imitation crab). The sushi was delicious. The boiled egg in the ramen was perfect.

I thought the fish was very fresh, well prepared and very well priced. they even had kids sushi rolls on the menu for the little ones, awesome!  Now the service was clunky, but it's new so I'll give them a bit of a break. The server didn't really have much of a handle on when the food was coming out, was confused about some of the drink ordering (we ordered a large beer and a hot sake and got a small beer and a half filled little sake container..with no sake glasses).   We also  ordered the beignets, which I found heavy but they were okay. All in all, i'll for sure be back. Solid 3.5 stars",

I was contacted right away by someone on yelp with an apology and to contact the GM at a certain email address,  and they would send me a $25 gift certificate.    I sent the first email and never got a reply.  I sent one more follow email 2 weeks later and did receive a reply with about 1 sentence asking for my address.   I sent him my address and nothing was ever sent.   Like I said he before I'm not looking for a hand out so I do not really care that they did not send me anything.  Its still the way it was handled all the way to very end.  Really just got the feeling they wanted to sweep it under the rug and forget about it.   I really enjoy the food squid ink,  but I will not go back to the downtown location again,  I like an aluminum free diet.",

A bit pricy compared to some other places  but it is downtown so that's to be expected. It is worth trying though because its one of the better sushi bars I've been to.",

It was pretty busy that day so we decided to site at the bar outside. Although it was steamy that day, they had the mist sprayers going so it was comfortable. The atmosphere was great and the bartender was awesome.  I didn't catch his name but he was super friendly and provided us a lot of info about what to do in Phoenix since we were only visiting. To drink we started with a taste of the Arizona Peach Ale. I'm not a beer drinker but my boyfriend loved this and I thought it was pretty tasty. To each with ordered the Hory Fook roll which based on the reviews I see is a big hit.  It was delish and you can't beat the tempura jalapenos. We also ordered the Beef Negamaki which I only thought was so so. The pieces were pretty small and some of them were overcooked in my opinion. I would be interested to try more rolls as they all looked good, from what I saw.  This place has great ambiance, great music (90's hip hop) and people seemed to enjoy themselves there.  If you are in the area you should definitely check it out.",

We stopped in around 5pm for some Happy Hour sushi and wine. We sat on the patio, which wasn't the best choice with the constant noise of the Metro buses stopping directly in front of Squid Ink, and the vagrants who could hit you up for fifty cents so they can \"catch the bus\"--but that's not Squid Ink's fault.   I'd like to recognize our server Stephanie for the great service received. She was very personable and timely with everything.  We had the Tempura Calamari appetizer, which was satisfying in regards to the freshness of the squid and the complement of the spicy aioli, but the batter was just bland and lacking in any form of seasoning. We then split the Horry Fook and Philly rolls. Horry Fook roll had great texture with the firmness of the jumbo shrimp and the crunchiness of the tempura breaded jalapeno, but again the tempura just lacks in flavor.   Unlike most places downtown, Squid Ink has Happy Hour seven days a week from 3-7p.",

I have always appreciated the service and the quality of food. The complaint of expensive came up, the restaurant it is not inexpensive, but not over the top as many establishments are.  I usually do not sit at a table but did because of family. A situation arose.....The management was quick to resolve the issue,  and  I thank them for that. I am by myself most the time, but brought my husbands grandparents (who are not easy to satisfy) and the people next to us  offended them,but except for the disruption they really enjoyed the experience, food was great,and I also appreciated the establishment for accommodating and responding to the situation. I don't know everyones names who were working that evening but THANK YOU ALL....I hope you never second guess this place its perfect for young and old. If you are ever unhappy just tell them they will fix it....Don't write negative reviewes  until you have tried to resolve an issue waitstaff work hard to resolve mistakes.... It is how they resolve them is what counts!",

The service I receive here has been top notch lately, even at the sushi bar which is the only place I sit every time I come here. I think the trick is to always dine-in and everything is all gravy. Think twice before you order to-go. I feel the quality lacking when it's to-go in my opinion. They have recently changed their menu. Mostly good things. The biggest change I noticed was in their ramen. Instead of always pork ramen, it is now \"chef's choice.\" I was quite disappointed in their chicken ramen. Not nearly enough flavor for me. For the future, I decided to call in before coming in for ramen from now on because their pork ramen is the #1 reason I keep coming back to Squid Ink. Reason #2: you will get the most bang for your buck with their Spicy Tuna bowl. It is $13 which is pretty pricey but it costs less than most of their House rolls but comes with eggplant tempura, asparagus, and topped with avocado. MAKE SURE they don't forget ponzu sauce (has happened to me before) because it is the icing on the cake in this dish. Squid Ink feels like a splurge every time but portions are fair for the price and it is in a great location downtown.",

The hostess was extremely helpful and made sure to get us a really nice table in timely manner.   Between 6 of us, we ordered so much food. So, I decided to give a sushi yet another try.  And I must say it was a success. I tried a lots of different kinds and it was all pretty good despite my lack of love for sushi.   Server was awesome as well. She was very present and helped us with all questions that we had. She made sure to check on us at all times and was really kind and funny at the same time!   Atmosphere was really good.

It is in hand when you are wrapped up in scarves and coats, battling the cruel Arizona winter, just trying to survive.  I am careful about where I order an old fashioned.  They require more than throwing some maraschino cherry that is an unnatural hue of red in a glass with a slice of orange and some booze.  No no no.  They need a gentle touch.
