We ordered the vegetarian pizza and scamorza with mushrooms.   The pizza was really tasty, a great combo of sweet caramelized onions and peppers. The pizza was fairly large, I could only eat one slice.  The scamorza was basically a skillet of cheese with sauteed mushrooms on top of it. It was really cheesy, but tasty. I'm pretty sure this shaved a year or two off my life expectancy though, so I won't be ordering it again.  I'll be back for a pizza date night!",

When will restaurant owners ever learn people don't appreciate under priced food. They don't see it as a value they just see it as cheap.   As for Grazie they have simply the best pizza you will find. If you are in Old Town Scottsdale and can only eat at one place you must choose Grazie",

The Italian wine selection is excellent, not the junk you find in most places.  This owner really knows his wines.  Most comes from a distributer, Chianti.  I had a bottle of 2009 Unmerto Cesare from Romanga the other day thats was outstanding, 85% Sangiovese and 15% Cabernet, 91 points rated by Parker.  It was excellent and you can buy it to take out for $22.  Oh the nutella.banana calzone for desert with a giant scoop of ice cream tops of the dinner..",

It has the classy but homey feel and authentic pizza. The less you try to eat only mainstream (Like the Americana) the better it gets. We've loved the Complementi, Napoli, and Vegetarian especially. Love the food and love how we never leave filling sick or like there was way too much dairy. It's light but filling.  The literal only complaint I've ever had here is there is one server who is the only one I've been on recent visits, and she is very kind, but not very good at her job. She can be oddly abrasive and distracted.",

But put aside the yummy sangrias and pizza, the dessert is the main event. You MUST get the Dulce Della Casa which is a sweet calzone with nutella and bananas in it, and a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream to go with it! WOW!!

Service was slow, I think because there was only one person working. Good thing it wasn't busy. We ordered brussetta appetizers and they came out burnt black edges. Our entree was the Margerhita pizza and we added tomato. Pizza was burnt also and looked like something from restaurant nightmare. Pizza was overly oily and was swimming with sauce/oil! When we picked up the pizza everything slid off! I had to cut the pizza with a knife which was difficult because it was burnt. Also ice tea was a fresh brew. He didn't give us enough ice so he put a glove on and dipped into our water pitcher to add ice.. Sorry just think this is weird and unprofessional.",

We inquired on the temperature of the wood fire oven and we were told they run it around 6-700 degrees. I love wood fired pizza and was excited to give theirs a try. We ordered the Margarita pizza, but that didn't seem to be what they brought out. What appeared on the table looked like a cheese crisp, with a leaf of basil in the middle. The crust was thin and soggy, the sauce was bland and the cheese poor quality and greasy. After eating half of a large I was still hungry. Perhaps this was an off day for them, the pictures (on yelp) of gorgeous bubbly crusts must mean they know how to do pizza right. I'd be willing to try them again, but the pizza was very disappointing.",

The food. Order anything with the carmelized onions. The \"steak on a stick\" (Speidini al Forno) is insanely good. The vesuvius calzone/pizza thing truly is a giant volcano of deliciousness.  4.

    "text": "I dropped by Grazie Pizzeria & Wine bar to surprise my friend Ebony K. who was attending a wine tasting event put on by the AZWinebats. It was my first experience with Grazie & the Winebats. Thankfully the recent rains had stopped and it made for a pleasant afternoon that could be enjoyed on the patio or inside with the doors open. I loved the interior and decor.   The event was $20 and provided tastings of 8 wines and samples of food. The food consisted of three different types of Bruschetta, two types of salad and about five various types of pizzas. If you left hungry, it was your own fault. The food kept coming! I had the Bruschetta Salsiccia which was loaded with Melted Provolone covering sausage & fennel. I didn't try the Caesar salad, but the Emiliana was excellent. The pizzas were thin crust, and the first was a little soggy. It was a pepperoni pizza and most of the toppings  were slid off - but it was good. A second piece was better. I am not sure all of the varieties, but I do know Vegetariana was one that I remember.  The wine presented a nice sampling. The best for me was the first one, which also happened to be the cheapest - the Orvieto Amabile from Bigi. It was a sweet, white wine.  I liked the Sangiovese Riserva from Umbeito Cesari, a red; and Rosso di Podernovo from Castello Delle Regine. The one most people seemed to not like the most was the most expensive - a champagne Brut Rose' from Hello Kitty.   The owner and the staff were extremely nice and explained each wine selection, they held a raffle for a few prizes and kept the food coming. The atmosphere of the restaurant was excellent. One thing that was distracting was the restaurant seemed to retain sound well and the place was loud, even with the doors open. Sometimes it was a little difficult to hear.  As for the food, the wine, the event and the company - excellent all the way around!",

That was enough to make us miserably full! But of course we had to try that nutella calzone, so we ordered a small one, thinking we'll just have a small bite each.

They tried to expand throughout the Valley but the owner does not have real good business operations sense. His wife brings that to the table but the operational management was farmed out to the owners daughter in DC Ranch and it failed miserably. We went back to the Old Town (original) location last Friday at 4 PM and it was deserted. We wanted to sit at the bar and enjoy a couple of the great Italian wines, but the bar was covered with paperwork and there was nowhere to really sit there. The doors were propped wide open even though it was only in the 50s outside. There were no visible service staff, only the owner Maurizio. We walked around to see where we'd want to sit but he didn't even acknowledge us. We were in there about 5 minutes and never got the sense that the place was even open we decided to leave and go to another pizza place. That place was hopping. The two places are day and night at all levels. Well to be perfectly honest, Maurizio still has the better wine selection, but other than that I can't recommend Grazie. By the way, the Website and the sign out front advertise that they're open from 11 AM to 10 PM Daily but you'd never know it.",

Rude, unattentive, attitude-laden and completely distracted with her own evening.  The food was just as bad: my salad was more soup-y than greens due to major dressing over-load.  Pizzas were undercooked and lacking quality ingredients- barely any cheese.  The bruschetta appetizer was the absolute worse though: blah bread topped with low-quality sausage (I'm talking Jimmy-Dean breakfast stlye!) and smothered in rubbery cheese with no flavor.  Bruschetta is supposed to have some form of tomato, no?  I feel bad giving such a poor review to a local business, but I will not be back.  No wonder there was no wait at 730 on a Friday night.",

    "text": "Grazie?  No Grazie .....  My family and I decided last minute to go out for some great pizza at POMO.  Unfortunately, the recent press they received has caused an influx of patrons looking for the same great pizza we were and the wait was longer than we cared to deal with since we were starved.  We decided to try Grazie based on some fairly decent reviews and the similar pizza style they claim to prepare.  When we arrived I first thought, wow, this appears to be a well put together restaurant.  Cool building and neat colors in the Old Town Scottsdale location.  We were greeted by a \"tween\" age girl in the most ridiculously short shorts.  It's was borderline disturbing.  We were seated at the table that they readied for us when I called ahead.  To my surprise, the table wasn't ready when we were seated because it was covered in flour.  The bus boy told us that he'd wipe it down since that's where they were \"rolling the dough?\"  Really, on a table in the restaurant?  Anyway, I felt good about the cleanliness of the table since throughout dinner and the rest of the evening the bleach smell stayed with us.  The seating arrangement was quite awkward because the table directly next to us was being used as the \"tween\" workers area to store their purses, iPhones and silverware they needed to wrap.  Every few minutes, they would sit down next to us, chat and text.  Isn't there work to do, customers to tend to or something to tidy up?  If not, I'd suggest an employee lounge.  My wife and I ordered a couple cocktails.  She had wine and I had a 'birra.'  Both were nice.  We ordered an appetizer to share -- Caprese Salad.  The waitress delivered the salad and mentioned she asked the chef to add an additional piece of tomato, mozzarella, and basil so that my wife, daughter and I could each have two slices.  Very nice of her.  Unfortunately, the Caprese Salad was mediocre at best.  The presentation was sloppy; the bottom of the plate was puddled in olive oil and the cracked pepper was kinda just all over the place....just looked messy.  The quality of the mozzarella was sub par for an $11 salad.  It was dense and dry, as if I went to local grocery store and bought a slab of mozzarella cheese.  We ordered two pizzas -- Margherita ($13) and the Capricciosa ($15).  They arrived promptly and looked good.  The crust was great on both pies; light, airy, with a nice chew.  The Margherita is a very simple pie.  It was good, but not great.  It could have used a bit more 'freshly' chopped basil right out of the oven vs. the small flower of basil cooked and burnt at the center of the pie.  I really wanted the Capricciosa to be great, but it wasn't.  I've been known to complain when pizza toppings are shorted especially for the per topping prices some pizza restaurants charge.  However, this was the exact opposite.  The Capricciosa had way too much in terms of volume of topping, specifically the kalamata olives.  They overpowered all of the more delicate flavors from the artichokes and italian ham.  The artichokes were a bit hard and not cut small enough for a delicate pie.  It was just ok.  Quite a hefty price tag for what you would think to be a simple dinner.  How much you ask?   2 Beers 2 Glasses of Wine 2 Pizzas 1 Salad  $80.64 inc'd tip  We decided against desert and went to the Sugar Bowl!  Yumm ...",

It's fine if you're looking for a trendy (yet un-stylish) hot spot where young (and arguably hot) boys and girls hang out. But, if you're looking for a tasty meal, devoid of bagged lettuce and pepper that was ground 5 years ago (what self respecting restaurant would not use fresh ground pepper???), I would venture someplace else.",

My wife and I split their spinach salad and our friends split a caesar salad.  These salads easily could have fed 4 people.  We then split a bruschetta appetizer that also was a huge portion and the 4 of us ended up splitting this as well. This had 3 different kinds of bruschetta topping--very good.  My wife and I split a pizza with prosciutto and spinach.  Outstanding with huge slices of fresh prosciutto.  We didn't come close to finishing it.  Our friends had eggplant parmigiana and a combination pizza and calzone.  My only complaint and it is a minor one is that the waitress should have probably told us in advance that we were ordering way too much food.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.  Very good place and will go back next time I am in Scottsdale.",

The service was disappointing, the girls were very nice but didn't really know how to manage their time so I spent a lot of time waiting for my server.. Anyway I got my pizza and walked home, I opened the box to discover a good looking pie, which made me smile but when I went to grab a slice, I noticed my server didn't bother to slice it properly or even at all (even though I saw her slicing other pizzas!)  Luckily, I do have a pizza cutter so it worked out. The pizza was good, crispy crust, light toppings.   All in all it was not what I expected. Give it a try, but I won't be going back.  Happy New Year my darlings !",

    "text": "Really Good Pizza & Service This Time! Great Improvement!  I am writing a second review of Grazie because I have now had a better experience than my first!  In my last review of Grazie, I had stopped in here in June on a day when the lone person working in the restaurant was juggling several indoor tables with a very large party outside on the patio. My experience at that time beyond having to wait for service, was that the pizza, while not bad, really needed to cook a bit more as it was a bit soggy in the center. It was understandable under the circumstances, and we felt bad for the lone server/chef, still, our experience in June was just ok.  My visit this weekend was because I was craving a really good thin crust pizza, and because Grazie came so close last time to hitting the mark. I decided to try it again, and hoped there were no large groups present...  Once again, there was only the lone server/chef working by himself, but thankfully this time, there was no group, and only a few tables of diners. I was seated and brought water immediately, (I picked a spot to sit where there were no air conditioning vents to cool my pizza faster than I could eat it - a problem on my last visit) and settled in to contemplate my order. The smell of pizza baking in the oven made my mouth water...  I decided on the Roma (kalamata olives, capers, and anchovies were calling me) with garlic added, and within minutes, the server came and took my order. My pizza didn't take long to come out, and it looked absolutely perfect. I prepared myself for the possibility of a soggy middle, but was thrilled to find that the bottom of the crust on my pizza was completely crisp!   There was a nice balance of sauce, mozzarella, and toppings so that the pizza wasn't overloaded or too skimpy. There was lots of flavor in each bite, and the crust was so good that I even ate all of the edges.   While I had to take half of the pizza home, I found that evening that it heated up perfectly crisp on a rack in my toaster oven.  I plan to go back again soon - this time for the Marcello or the Marinara since I'm trying to avoid meat (for now). I think a salad would be in order as well!",

The portions are huge. Two of us shared a small Emiliana salad, a Napoli pizza, and pannacotta; which left both of us satisfyingly full. And just as good as the food was the ambiance of the restaurant, with the owner acting as the perfect host who ensured that we experienced an authentic Italian dining experience.",

I called to see if pastas were homemade she wasn't sure and asked does anyone make pasta fresh? Why yes dear they really do. I asked since she wasn't sure if maybe a server or someone would know, she said it's all about the sauces in her mind and suggested we go elsewhere! This convo went on for 3 minutes and  I was seriously appalled and flustered. Thank you thank you for the encouragement to go elsewhere.. because we did.. Craft 64 right next door as fate would have it. If this person worked at our restaurant (yes Im in the industry) she would be so out of there so fast her head would spin. Crazy how a place can loose business before you even get to try their food. Maybe your food is ahhhmazing but I will never know and all I wanted was a good pizza and a pasta dish. I got it too per your recommendation so for that I appreciate your unkindness",

I don't understand why they could not put more than one or two pizzas in the oven at the same time.  I was watching- I think it took him 20 minutes just to put my pizza in the oven..  The pizza was decent but at $15.00, I sort of expected better.  With a drink and tip, I spent over $20.00.  Just too expensive for what you get..",

I decided to skip the Cinque Formaggi (\"five cheeses\") that I \"normally\" order (well, twice in the past, anyway!) and try the \"Complimenti alla Mamma!,\" which came w/ tomato sauce, mozzarella, mountains of ricotta (LOVE it!), ham, salame, and Parmigiano Reggiano.  Grazie certainly knows how to win my heart w/ its thin-crusts!!  And just look at the amount of ricotta on my pizza!  Loved the ham and the basil leaves, but I really did not enjoy the salame.  (I'd wanted to omit it, but thought I might get to like it.  Pfft!)  Even w/ the salame fail, this pie was so good, it will keep Grazie on my list of go-to pizzerias... way to go!  Guess I'll see you next year, Grazie!",

First, it's absolutely beautiful and I love that I can see the brick oven that you're cooking the pizza in and actually watch the guys make the pizzas by hand, press out the dough, and use that giant wooden thing to put it in the brick oven. It definitely makes for an amazing experience, and I love that they were able to get our whole group in.  I just wish the food lived up to everything else! I'm not saying it's not good, it's just not amazing and tastes relatively bland. Some herbs in the pizza dough, or even ON the pizza would go so far because letting the ingredients speak for themselves when you use only average quality ingredients just doesn't make a home run.   The cheese and meat plate to start was dissapointing and obviously was a bunch of pre-packaged cheeses and meats that were laid out on a plate with a few olives. In an environment as beautiful as this, at least cut your own? Have a small deli space for it??  The pizzas themselves ranged from so crispy it was like eating cheese on a cracker to almost chewy in consistency. It wasnt that pleasant and although we all liked our pizzas no one was \"oohing and aahing\" over the flavors. Personally, I much prefer Cibo whenever I go to Phoenix, but I'd probably not demand to go to somewhere else if it was chosen again.",

    "text": "Been going here since it opened. Owner-managed, authentic cooking techniques, with interesting modern variations. The oven is an authentic Vesuvio brick oven, imported from Italy. The owner is there on-site a lot and sometimes even running the oven. Most of the staff has been around for years and years. Love the Emiliana salad, all the pizzas, and the Dolce della Casa is decadent. Try the scamorza if you are a serious cheese lover and all the other deserts are amazing as well. This pizza is just as good as Pizzeria Bianco on its best day, more consistent, and have never had a long wait. Great atmosphere and superb outdoor dining. The servers are really friendly, gorgeous, and the owner's fluffy white puppy sits attentively on a bar stool, watching all the action behind the bar while soccer is probably playing on the TV.",

    "text": "Starting off with three stars for Grazie because I have only had take out pizza there once so I can't speak to service, atmosphere or any other dishes. From this pizza alone I can see the rating will go up. A few of us decided to order pizzas for a late lunch/very early dinner - I ordered the Vegetariana and the second pie was a meat-encrusted thing whose name I don't know. That pizza was devoured so I'm guessing if you like meat-encrusting, you will really love that pizza.   I thought the vegetarian selection on the menu was limited, I really wanted a red sauce pizza loaded with greenery, but Quattro Formaggi, Vegetariana and Margherita were my only options. That's fine, the veg was really tasty and just COATED with cheese which is one of pizza's finer qualites in my book. It was also laced with caramelized onions and red peppers...my only qualm there was that it was more bunches dropped sporadically on the pie than evenly distributed.   All in all a delicious handmade pizza. I love the crunchy AND chewy crust that is thin but holds up to the mass quantities of topping it can hold. And it didn't get wet and soggy from grease which makes for much less mess all over my clothing, hands and face. yay!  I will make a point to dine at Grazie in the near future!",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Grazie for quite some time as I live very close by and I absolutely love their pizza.  My family and I go there and order out quite often, but after our last visit I don't think we will be back, unfortunately.   For the first time, I ordered a cheese platter - I was just in the mood.  When it arrived I was a little disappointed - but the hard parmesan was good so I ate a little of everything.  That's when I noticed mold growing on some of the cheese.  A light bluish/tinted fuzziness that one would not normally catch if they were chatting with someone and enjoying a glass of wine.  I was so shocked.  I literally got this queezy feeling in my stomach like I was going to vomit.  I mentioned it to my waiter who questioned me for a second, looked and took the plate. I informed him I didn't want another one and he took it off my bill.  I honestly thought a manager/owner was going to approach me and say something like \"I'm so sorry for what happened, rest assured I'll be checking everything in the back and please your meal is on us!\" type of thing. But NO! The platter was not mentioned after that.  This was something unsanitary served to a customer and ingested by said customer!  I'm literally getting sick thinking about it right now!  The add insult to injury my knife had a dry piece of residual spinach/basil or lettuce stuck to it.  Talk about unsanitary!  Ugh...at the end of the meal (which we took to go) we got our bill minus the inedible cheese platter, paid and left!   Althought Grazie makes one of my favorite pizzas of all time, I will never again return.  To me - this incident was unforgivable.  I hope they will change whatever policy they have in terms of checking the freshness of their ingredients and produce.  And they also change their policy on customer service in situations such as this.",

Being a finicky Italian I know what good Italian is and wow they are it.  I'm just going to have to tell you that you must try it to believe it. I also tried this crazy dessert with pizza dough, banana's, ice cream and chocolate.  OMG it was amazing.  I love that they have the wood fired oven right there for you to watch what is going on.

    "text": "Went to Grazie's with the family back in May on a suggestion from my sister in law. We took the visiting grandfather and his wife(that's another story), who can be a little hard to please when it comes to food, so we were a little nervous. We got there early on a Friday night and the place was not yet busy. We had a nice table by the front patio and were helped promptly.   We started our meal with some bruschetta and a couple of caprese salads. Both were very good. The table ordered 3 pizzas. All were good sized and delicious. We had the Margherita, the Vegetariana, and one with pepperoni and sausage.  The Vegetarian was my favorite.  It was a white pizza, so no sauce, covered with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers.  Delicious!  The other two were good, but not my faves.  We ordered a couple of the dessert calzones and a tiramisu.  The tiramisu was great, but the dessert calzones were incredible!  A doughy pastry stuffed with a banana and nutella spread.  It was then baked and covered with vanilla ice cream.  Decadent to say the least.  Several people at the table ordered coffee.  They said it was good, not a coffee drinker.  Overall a great dining experience.  I would put the pizza on par with Bianco, mainly because of the wait time.  The patio looked very inviting and would be a great lunch spot in the spring or dinner in the summer.  I'll be back!",

    "text": "Went to Grazie's on Saturday night.  Probably not the best time to give it a accurate review because the place was absolutely packed.  We got the last table inside, tucked in the corner and very hard to access.   I was immediately impressed by the large retail wine rack and the large brick oven in the corner.  The wine list was very good and featured an ALL Italian selections.    We ordered Bruschetta Appetizer that was larger then most offerings I have ever seen.  It arrived very quickly, I was stunned at how fast it arrived.  When we began eating it the bread was soft and soggy in the middle, indicating it had been sitting around a while. I should have sent it back, but I was starving so I tolerated it.    The pizza was good. Not out of this world great, but Ok.  I wanted it a little more well done, but again, I can't fault the wait staff, I didnt specify.  I do feel as if they rushed the pizza out a little early, maybe because they were so busy.    Here is the only thing I did'nt like about Grazie's.  It was very, very loud for a small room.  I am sure it is the concrete floors, minimalist walls and low ceilings but it was so loud I couldnt have a conversation with someone sitting directly across from me.    I was not over impressed with Grazie's but I reconize that the little things I was not happy about were all coeisidental and I am excited to try it again.",

    "text": "This review gets one star in my book, solely based on the ghastly way we were treated by management after already receiving poor service all night.  Here's what happened...  About a week prior to our visit, I called and made a dinner reservation for a table of 12 for the following Saturday night.  I requested a table outside, after confirming that there would be ample heaters should it get chilly.  I was told that would be no problem (on all counts), and the reservation was booked.  The day before our dinner, we had one more decide to join us.  I called the restaurant back, requesting that we add one more.  They again assured me that would be no problem, and confirmed the reservation on the patio, now for 13.  Three of us arrived at Grazie about 30 minutes prior to our reservation time, expecting to get a glass of wine at the bar while we waited for our group to arrive.  The hostess informed us that the table was ready, and we could just sit there if we wanted.  No problem.  When we get to the table, the only heater close to us was off, so we asked if they could turn it on.  The hostess said she would send someone right out, and that our server would be with us shortly.  Twenty minutes later, the server came over and took our wine and appetizer order (mind you, the heater is still off at this point).  We asked her again if we could have someone turn it on, and she said she'd have someone come over.  Ten minutes later our group began to arrive...and we still hadn't even received so much as a glass of water.  After another 10 minutes or so, the wine and appetizers arrived....but no silverware.   We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our waitresses attention and request silverware, and get the rest of our party's drink orders in.  In addition, we asked for the heater to be turned on again.....  Throughout dinner, service was incredibly slow, items were forgotten (my friend ordered a coffee, which came black - with no request of if she would like cream or sugar - and again it took forever to track down the server to get it)...After our 5th or 6th request to have the heater turned on, one member of the table actually went inside to ask someone else if we could get it turned on.  The waitress came back to the table and told us that the propane tank was empty, but they'd have another one moved over to our table (ummm why did they put out a heater with an empty propane tank in the first place??)..again, two or three requests later and the 'new' heater still had not been moved to the table.  All of a sudden, a busboy showed up with a lighter, and lit our ORIGINAL heater - apparently NOT empty, and about an hour and a half late.  When we received the bill, an automatic 20% gratuity was added (due to the party's size) which we felt should be disputed based on the horrible service we had received thus far.  So two of us went inside to speak to a manager about our experience.  The owner, a fairly grumpy man, let us get out two words before he started spouting all the defenses he could think of as to why the service was bad....\"short staffed, not enough silverware, busier than usual, etc\".  Not once was there an apology for the service received.  At one point, he interrupted me (again) to say \"what is it you want from me\"...I said \"i'd like you to at least listen to me.  You haven't let us finish a single sentence yet\"....at which point he threw up his arms and said \"i don't have time for this.  It's not my fault you had bad service, that's your server's fault\".  I have to say, I was incredibly impressed at his quick willingness to throw the server under the bus after already stating they were \"short staffed, etc\".  He then motioned over a woman who I assume was a manager, although her attitude and statements were beyond unprofessional, and said \"you take care of this\" (motioning in our direction).  Up to this point, we had been calm, collected and polite, but this was too much.  The woman asked what we needed, and again (one final time) tried to explain the situation and the service we had received.  Without listening to a word, she jumped in and said \"I'm sorry, but do you see how busy we are??  We are FUCKING awesome.  Maybe this isn't \"Your\" kind of establishment\".  Our jaws dropped to the floor at the rediculous rudeness and COMPLETE lack of professionalism or customer service we were witnessing.  And let me state for the record that our group consisted of several high profile professionals in the scottsdale area that would potentially take clients there as well.  My friend, pissed beyond believe at this point, stated that we would most likely not be returning if this is how they treated their customers, and that our friends would be doing the same.  She replied with \"that's fine with us, clearly you don't belong here\".. And when we mentioned that we would be sharing this experience with others via Yelp and word of mouth, she said (sarcastically) \"Oh please do\"....So here I am.  DONT GO TO GRAZIE.",

Moderately priced, pretty good pizza that also is good reheated (BTW, don't mess up your pizzas using an oven... reheat your leftover pizza on a skillet set to medium low to get that cracker crunch bottom without drying the top)  Ingredients are fresh and the sauce is well balanced. Pizza crust is brick oven style with tasty crispy/chewy texture... about enough for 2 people (perfect!). The salads are also very fresh along with the desserts.  Wine selection is very respectable and service is attentive.  As for atmosphere, lots of beautiful people (hey, it's scottsdale) amongst patrons and staff alike, trendy yet cozy at night with candles and rustic decor. Sit outside to enjoy the arizona night. located in old town scottsdale next to all the happenin' clubs.  Like I said... a fantastic first date place. Ideal as it's cool and won't break the bank.",

    "text": "Haven't been to this place in about 3 years and man has it gone downhill.  The \"young\" servers all need to be trained.  I would say retrained but I don't think they were ever trained to begin with.    We deliberately went on a Tuesday because the place is very small and we didn't want to wait around for a table.  We got seated as soon as we arrived but didn't have a server come to our table for close to 15 minutes.  The servers, 3 of them, were standing by the wine area talking with each other.  Finally I asked if we could order some drinks. The girls all looked at each other as if they were trying to decide who would handle our table.  One finally came over and no apology for waiting just a \"what do you need?\"  We ordered a bottle of wine, salad, and a pizza.    The pizza was heavily burnt on the edges and the salad was good but the lack of service never changed.  I asked for water twice and never got it.  Finally after about ten minutes of waiting i just walked up to the serving station and asked for water and waited till she gave them to me. She didn't apologize or say she forgot about them just rolled her eyes and handed me 2 cups of water.  Keep in mind there were maybe 3 other tables with people and the remainder of the place was empty.    Whatever the girls were talking about was apparently more important than the customers.  This place used to have good service and loyal customers, like me, but i won't be returning ever again.  I also know that they used to have a couple other locations in the valley but those have closed down.  I'm sure that if this place continues treating it's customers like this it to will be closing down.",

The owner is actually Italian, so that gives this place another star on the authenticity alone.

Started with being greeted in a less than welcoming manner by the owner, who made us feel guilty for being at her restaurant. Then it took about 20 minutes to even get water, and she only brought 2 instead of the needed 4. When she finally decided it was time to serve our table, she recommended a wine and seemed personally offended that it wasn't to our liking. All of our food came out burnt, but she never came back to check on the quality of our meal. She then spoke to me with foul language regarding her employees and their drinking habits. EXTREMELY inappropriate, there was a child at the table and I was at dinner with my family. I asked her to not speak that way and she decided to whisper instead. We finished with dessert  (also burnt) and continued to wait another 20 or so minutes for our check. Completely awful service, although burnt the food was still good. However, I will never return to this establishment nor would I recommend it to anyone. For being the owner, I was completely appalled by the lack of tact and professionalism I witnessed this evening.",

They have a tv behind the bar which is nice to catch the score of whatever game is on.  The bruschette miste to start is a must.  Four different kinds of bruschette, traditional tomato, a pesto or white bean drizzled with olive oil, a hearty ragu, and a fantastic sausage topped with provolone. You can each as their own order as well.  The carpaccio salad is also a great start to the meal; it is huge and easily shared between four people.  For the pizza, everyone MUST try the Dame Edna at least once.  Mozzarella that bakes into the delicious chewy, thin, and slightly crispy crust topped with fresh arugula, prosciutto, and shaved parmesan.  Drizzle with olive oil right before you eat and it's heaven.  I don't think I've ever been here and not ordered it.  The lasagna and beef Spiedini are also nicely done if you don't want pizza.  The banana/nutella calzone is out of this world.  Topped with fast melting ice cream you have to eat it quick, but that won't be the reason for scarfing it down.  The panna cotta and tirimisu are also a very good way to end the meal.  The wine list is quite extensive and there are many reasonable bottles of wine to choose from.  They have a very nice Nebbiolo by the glass which is hard to find.  Lunch is also a great deal as they serve smaller pizzas and wonderful panninis.  The patio is great and the restaurant is open air with breakaway doors/walls which adds to the relaxing atmosphere.",

They say the house make the mozzarella, that confuses me because it is super oily?  If you use quality mozzarella its not like that. You use whole milk.  So this is one of the worst pizzas ever. I'm sticking to Grimaldis, better pizza, better salad.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars.   I went to Grazie on a Saturday night with no reservations with about 18 other people. Lo and behold, we were all seated with a bunch of tables lined up diagonally on the patio. That, to me, is impressive, given what everyone wrote here about it not being a group kind of place.  Apparently the owner of Grazie and the owner of Cibo used to be business partners and then they fell out and now have competing pizzerias. Things you learn when natives are in your midst.   Anyway, the ambiance was decent and nowhere near as Scottsnoxious as some nearby environs. I had the Marcello pizza which was pretty basic and was made in typical authentic Italian style. It didn't blow my socks off but I'd definitely eat it again. But the real reason some folks in the group took us there was to experience the calzone.   Not a calzone for dinner. A calzone for dessert. Filled with bananas & nutella, and topped with vanilla ice cream. I thought the combination of salty calzone shell with the sweetness of everything else was interesting and pretty good, but hot damn was it was the hardest thing to cut through. Seriously, within 5 seconds each calzone looked like that one Gremlin which exploded in the microwave (don't remember? Netflix the movie again!). Now I've had better nutella/banana desserts elsewhere, but this was still a tasty morsel. Albeit not the most user-friendly one.  All in all, I found the prices agreeable and on par with similar places throughout the Valley, and the service was fast and really efficient for such a mass of people. I'd give it another shot and come back again - just next time maybe not in a group of 19. N-n-n-n-19.",

The pizza is fantastic as well - light and artisan style with great ingredients. The best part is possibly the dessert - decadent and delicious. If you leave here and don't have the dolce, you're a crazy person.  This is a sweet spot to take a date or to meet someone for lunch instead of Oreganos. I like their wine list - particularly the reds. I've meant to pick some up to take home since they have a retail price as well.   This review is revised as of May 2008. Originally, I had reviewed this and talked about the owners splitting up and all that shit and I had given it a 4 star rating. I think I was feeling peer pressure with that score. I personally feel this is a great restaurant in a great area.",

    "text": "Let me just preface by saying I absolutely love the food at Grazie! The Emiliana salad is fantastic and the Vegiearina Pizza is to die for (the onions are so sweet and the perfect mix with the salty cheese).   BUT... after my experience there a few weeks ago with a large party, I seriously might never go back! The place has a reputation for terrible service, and I guess it fulfilled those expectations. Our party of 13 for a surprise birthday dinner was seated for 15 minutes before the absentminded server came to let us know he'll be with us shortly for drinks. Finally, he came over, took our drink order and I let him know up front that we would need to do separate checks.... his response: \"ummm that takes a long time, can you do at least 4 people per check?\"  What?!?   After pre-ordering the desert calzone, he decided to place the order for a regular calzone and not let the guest of honor order an entree because \"someone else already ordered for him.\"   Half way through the meal, a surprise guest arrive- a Cockroach scurrying across our table! The owner simply said \"oh it's because we leave the patio doors open\" and took the crushed roach in my napkin to the trash.   After 2 1/2 hours it's desert time, we get the Calzone situation straightened out, and before even asking anyone if they would like to order desert, plates and silverware are placed on the table (hello... this is a surprise dinner, the Birthday boy doesn't know they are bringing him desert!!!).   Finally, we get the check, which of course, the server decided to just put us all on one bill (with an automatic 20% gratuity... no wonder why he didn't care about actually serving us) and then proceeded to complain about the number of credit cards being charged.   To all of you Grazie lovers: I have love for the place too, well, the food, but the above is just so unacceptable and disappointing... wouldn't you agree?   Total Time Frame: 7pm-11pm.... for Pizza.",

Our apps were burnt, as was the pizza, typical lack of knowledge about wood fire pizza leads to over and undercooked pizzas.  The calzone was a hot pile of salty awful.  The tomato sauce on everything was super acidic and lacked any flavor other than tomato. And it was more expensive than the parlor.  I should also add, our entrees came out at different times, offset by more than five minutes, and our server, even seeing uneaten burnt apps didn't offer an exchange or removal from the bill.  Four at the table, none wanted the burnt app..she asked it we wanted it boxed when it was clearly burnt.  Quality control needs work at this place, we wont be going back. It gets a second star for ambiance, it could have had three maybe if the prices dropped about 35%. Yes that would make it cheap..but it's cheap food with lacking quality.",

Get seated outside near the fireplace or under the twinkling lights, order an Emiliana salad and a Margherita (or Toscana) pizza and ENJOY!   I've been there -- for both lunch and dinner -- more than 10 times and I have nothing but praise for the consistency, quality (of both food and wait staff) and atmosphere (outdoor; indoors can be a little loud and stuffy). Be sure to save room for the Dolce Della Casa -- a dessert calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce (aka Nutella) and banana smothered in vanilla ice cream.   Note: If you're not doing the sugar thing, order the bruschetta Pomodoro as an appetizer. Yes, it's a little carb-heavy. But you're eating pizza, for crying out loud.",

Inside is quaint but rather noisy, outside is much more romantic and quiet, where you'll find a fireplace, really uncomfortable chairs that may leave a weird pattern of lines on your bare legs, and candlelight. We choose to sit outside.   We started the evening with the Caprese salad. It was good. Nothing more, nothing less, I probably won't remember it tomorrow. Then came our two individual pizzas, don't ask me why we ordered two... These pizzas are huge and one can certainly feed two people.   Presentation was great. I ordered the Dame Edna which was covered in a large mound of arugula and shaved cheese. It was dry, so dry I kept finding myself reaching for my water cup. What saved this pizza was the Prosciutto. I am a sucker for Prosciutto.   My date's pizza was definitely the better of the two. The Sofia pizza, with smoked Mozzarella and Prosciutto. Yum. The flavors were great and I felt a little pinch of jealousy every time he took a bite.... Hmgh   Service was good, ambiance good, prices were fine.

What we received was a plain cheese pizza with no flavor whatsoever.  When I asked about the pizza, our server told us that was their margherita pizza.

Umm...no it's not.  She did take the pizza off the bill so that was a plus; however, the bill was still extremely high. I've never seen house wine cost that much but whatever.  Service wasn't great.

The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isn't huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time.  First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril.  In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef \"medium\" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I don't usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didn't think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didn't even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasn't like I was full, they just tasted bland.  For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, you're outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream.   The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you aren't splitting entrees....",

If you are after pizza it looked okay - but I would walked to doors down to Craft 64 if I wanted pizza.   To Grazie - I say no thanks.  I felt like I was ripped off and was still hungry.",

    "text": "I went to Grazie tonight with my 8 year old son, and our new baby.  Being a Wednesday, I figured it would be a cute and quiet place for us to have a quick bite to eat.  We got there around 6:30PM, and there were two other small parties seated in the entire place.  Our server eventually came to help us, and I ordered what i thought were basic entrees for an Italian place.  My son ordered a ceasar salad with chicken, and I ordered what I thought would be the vegeterian pizza (the one with all the vegetables listed on the menu).  What I was served was apparently their actual pizza called the vegetariana.  It consisted of charcoal burnt \"carmelized onions, oily sundried tomatoes, and a little cheese, all burnt into a blackened and overcooked crust.  My son's salad was drowned in dressing which was very fishy tasting for a traditional caesar salad.  I also ordered a bottle of wine, had a glass, and corked it to bring home for my husband to enjoy with his sadly burnt pizza.  Upon serving myself one slice of the burnt pizza, I started examining it, as all i could see were piles of burnt \"carmelized onions\".  It clearly was NOT the vegetable pizza I was expecting.  Our server was nowhere to be found, so I went inside to ask for clarification as to what pizza I was served.  Inside, I found the server, next to a little dog perched on the bar, in the same room as the kitchen!!!! This is a whole other issue I will address another time.  I told the server that the pizza I received was not the one I wanted.  She informed me that it was the \"vegetariania\" and it was really good, and I should try it.  I was confused, as I had just told her that I didn't want it, and somehow the menu was confusing, as I wanted the vegetable pizza.  Burnt onions on burnt crust does not constitute vegetable pizza to me, for the outrageous price of 16.00!!!!!!   She VERY hesitantly offered to prepare another pizza for me, but again repeated how I really should just try the one I was served, because it is really really good.  At this point, I was in shock that I was being told I had to eat what I didn't want, and what was burnt as it was, instead of being served the actual pizza that I wanted.  I also told her that my husband didn't care for garlic or onions, and the pizza was actually for him once he got home from work this evening.  She then went on and on trying to tell me that the carmelized onions weren't really strong nor was the \"burnt garlic flavor\" I explained to her, that I tasted when I took one bite of the pizza.    After realizing that she really had no sincere intention of trying to make the order right, with her awkward and wishy washy offers to maybe make another if I really didn't like the ONE I NEVER WANTED TO BEGIN WITH, my son and I ate our gross meal and tried to enjoy our evening.    The most disturbing part of my experience at Grazie came after we were about finished eating.  Our server came over to check on us, and my son accidentally spilled his drink all ove the table.  I quickly grabbed a napkin and pushed the liquid into the center of the table.  Our waitress quickly \"sprung into action\" and exclaimed, oh, let me get you a towel for that...and then...the best part....SHE NEVER CAME BACK!!!!!   So there we are sitting at our table, with the only two paper napkins anywhere to be seen, soaked with soda, waiting.   Then, I look across the patio, to one of the other two tables in the entier place that have customers, and I see our lovely waitresss, TAKING THEIR FOOD ORDER!!!!!    She finally returns, apologising for not coming back sooner, and I just smile at her.  Then, she again suggests I order another pizza for my husband, and we can just make it the way he wants, no onions/garlic, etc.  At NO POINT during my interaction with her, after making it clear I didn't want the pizza she brought from the very beginning, did I ever imply I wanted to PAY FULL PRICE FOR A SECOND PIZZA!!!!!!    So, having said that, she returns with a second pizza, which at any other reputable establishment, would have been complimentary, given the series of events that had transpired that evening.    My bill came, and I was charged 16.00 for the disgusting burnt onion and crust pizza, AND for the actual pizza that I had wanted from the beginning, I was charged another 18.00!!!!!!!  Grazie is a poor excuse for a restaurant, and it's customer service is embarassing.  My bill came to over 85.00, for one adult, and an 8 year old.  Next time, my 8 year old and I will be going to the House Brasserie next door to Grazie, as they actually are deserving of the 85.00 tab that I would expect to receive there, because the food and service are 5 stars always.  If I had the energy tonight, I would have refused to pay  tab delivered to my table.  I was already traumatized by her inability to understand customer service, so I paid and left.  I will NEVER EVER return to this establishment, and am considering calling my bank to dispute the charges.",

I was ecstatic!!!!!!!!  My boyfriend and I went for date night. Right when we walked in, we got sat down right away. BUT 15 minutes later,  our waiter was no where to be found nor knew who was our waiter. I had to ask who our waiter was. One, she didn't speak English nor I can comprehend. Two, she kept smiling at me when I was talking to her,  she didn't listen to what I say.  honestly, whenever I had a question or command something,  I had to ask TWICE!!! Smh.  These couple came in 30 minutes after us, THEY GOT THEIR FOOD BEFORE US. I confronted the manager, he did not care, he said don't worry.  It'll come out.. wtf are you serious?    And, Whatttt? No hot sauce or ranch? Yeah. I was bummed out.  Overall. Horrible customer service. But I love my pizza .",

    "text": "Thanks to Groupon, we were able to find this place.  Located in Old Town just West of the Arts District, this Pizza joint is tucked away and kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the area.  The signage is small and hard to read from the street.  Also, the parking here is atrocious....very few spots on the street and a tiny parking lot adjacent to the restaurant.  There's also a few lots across the street, but they belong to other businesses and you might get ticketed there....we took a chance and parked behind Prestige Cleaners across the street....there were no other spots avail, we had no choice.  To enter, you have to walk through a small section of their patio seating.  The indoor dining room is pretty small and tables are tight....I don't recommend for groups larger than 6 people...outside seating is better for that.  Since it was still blazing hot outside, we sat inside.  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:  Americana Pizza (Pepperoni, Cheese), $15 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=-DWyi7nRMAp5fjmTFIgJXw#-DWyi7nRMAp5fjmTFIgJXw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/graz...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=UfuwVsHtCTo_QLyHsPVbNQ#UfuwVsHtCTo_QLyHsPVbNQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/graz...</a>  Complimenti Alla Mamma Pizza (Ham, Salame, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Mozzarella), $16  Caprese, $9  Red Sangria <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grazie-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-scottsdale?select=LsEh4oNsfJCSplVJTsfriA#LsEh4oNsfJCSplVJTsfriA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/graz...</a>  The Caprese came out first and was very good.  The portion size can easily feed 2 people as an appetizer.  Both of the Pizzas we had were very good.  I thought the Alla Mamma Pizza was better than the Americana Pizza...but they were both excellent.  The Americana was a bit soggy for our tastes (too much Sauce)...but it was full of flavor.  The Sangria helped us wash it all down....it comes in a nice sized carafe....can easily satisfy 2 or 3 people.  Service here was pretty good too.  Overall, a nice time out.  Return Factor - 77%",

I really liked the setting and outdoor patio of the place. A really good date spot or even a place to get together with friends for dinner. The downside was that their air conditioner was down! We are in Arizona so you can imagine how hot it was. It was actually cooler outside than it was inside. Thank god for those water misters! lol.   We ordered the Toscana pizza and a pitcher of the White Sangria to wash it down. This place actually reminded me of Sauce. They have the thin crust pizza. I really liked it. Ours was more of a Supreme pizza so it had all the toppings that I loved on it. The Sangria was also tasty. Not too sweet like it usually is.   I felt like the customer service was a bit slow. It was a bit busy when we were there so that's understandable. It took them a while to come over to our table just to get our drink orders. When we requested to get some balsamic vinegar with our bread the waitress forgot about it but she did apologize when she finally brought it to us.   Despite the a/c being down and the customer service being a bit slow I would come back. I really liked the food as well as the ambiance of the restaurant. =)",

Just like before, everything was excellent and I would order it again.  I just wish I remembered to read my earlier review before returning so I would be sure to order something different.  All the pizzas sound good and I want to try each one.  The service was very good.  Our waitress didn't seem to mind that we kept wanting to sample wine before we bought a bottle.  Their wine selection, by the way, is very good and reasonably priced.  Finally, I must add that sitting inside can be a bit noisy when it is crowded.  Temperature permitting, the patio is a better place to sit, eat and chat.",

    "text": "My family and I went to Grazie's for dinner with a Groupon.  On our first attempt, we could not be seated as the restaurant was so busy.  So the following time, we called ahead of time and reserved a table for 6.  We showed up at the reservation time only to be told that they did not have us down.  However, after consulting with a person who looked like the owner, we were told that they had not understood the name and sat us at a table that was appropriate for 4 people, but not for 6!  Anyway, we sat down and waited for a while, until the waiter came to take our order.  The place was so loud that waiters and us had a difficult time communicating.  Meantime, I had discovered that my chair was wiggly beyond my comfort zone, and then my father (an elderly man) showed me that his chair was unglued at the junction of the seat and the leg.  I requested new chairs for the two of us and they were given to us in a not so friendly manner.  When the pizzas arrived, there was no room to place them on the table, because this pizzeria does not use pizza stands and as I said, we were in too small a table!  However, we managed, and ate.  The pizzas were tasty, not great, but not bad either.  One of them had a burnt crust.  During our whole experience (and especially during the chair incident) I kept on glancing toward the \"owner\".  He avoided my eyes and of course never approached our table!  The GROUPON that we presented at payment was applied in the most profitable way for Grazie (a $4 difference that could have made a great difference in customer satisfaction!).  Oh well, we are never going back to Grazie...",

I had booked an evening reservation for a group of nine and after arriving (on time and all together) we were escorted to a back table.  Then, a minute later we were asked to wait outside as that table was actually reserved for a larger party who was running behind.  Although a little confused, we all obliged and waited outside of the restaurant.  30 minutes later, still no table.  The staff weren't exceptionally helpful and after asking to speak with the manager (who didn't seem to care much about the situation) we decided to leave.  It was a shame because we were really looking forward to dining there.  I understand that restaurants are often extremely busy for the dinner rush but if you're already overbooked, don't agree to take on another group reservation.  I imagine the service is better during off-peak hours but after our experience, I won't be going back to try it out.",

It came with two types of cheese (one edible, one chalky and flavorless) and three types of meet (the salami was alright, the other two were not). Although the appetizer platter was generous (which is good because it cost $15) there wasn't much on it worth eating. The sandwich was alright, but the pizza was greasy and ungenerous (it seemed like it was pre-made, frozen, then cooked). The only upshot is the nice outdoor seating and great wine menu, with reasonably priced glasses. If I came back here again, which I doubt I will, I would just stick to the wine. Lastly, the waitress was nice and helpful, but she also complained to us about some of the other customers at the restaurant, which was quite awkward.",

This dog was on the bar most of the time we were there, until a customer, who seemed a regular, picked it up and put in on a bar stool.  There was also another dog comfortably seated on one of the bar stools.  Not sure why we didn't walk out then, but...  After being seated, noticed tabletops were not clean, ditto for the floor.  There was only one other table occupied, so we figured at least we'd have our food quickly.  It's a small, dark place, but has a large, although not attractive, patio.  The service was good, and we had our food in a timely manner.  The Caesar salad was not crisp, and was drenched in dressing. There was no fresh Parmesan or croutons, which at $14, was overpriced.  The Toscano pizza arrived, undercooked in the center, and not visually appealing. There were abundant, but not fresh mushrooms, and the \"fennel\" sausage had no flavor of fennel.  There was not much flavor except of mushrooms.  I would never return to this restaurant, and would highly discourage anyone else from eating there.",

We also ordered a salad which was delish but if you don't like a lot of salad dressing be sure to order the dressing on the side, it was quite a lot.  We were so busy enjoying our food that a little dust storm blew through and we hardly noticed (even though we were sitting outside.)  My only complaint would be that service was a little slow but it's a quaint, quiet atmosphere that is not packed with hostesses and servers jostling everywhere so, in my opinion, the quiet evening (with fantastic food) was completely worth waiting a little longer for service :) This is a great place for a date night or a girls night, check it out!",

We were mid-order, and the waitress walked off before we could finish. She seemed to be very much in a hurry, even though the restaurant was only half full, if that. She barely gave us any time to ask any questions, as she would fly by our table. We asked if she would recommend the white or red sangria, as it was included in the Groupon. She said the red was good, and then said, \"Oh, you must have the Groupon.\" She barely gave us attention the rest of our visit there. Once we got the sangria, which we have ordered before, it seemed flat and tasteless. In the past, there has been a lot of fresh fruit cut up, and this time there was none. The pizza is always so good, and this time, it tasted like it was missed something... with all of the veggies and cheese, it ended up tasting like not much of anything. The owner was there with his dog sitting at the bar too, which seemed a little odd. We love Grazie, and we will give it another try sometime soon. I hope the next experience is better than the last. With so many pizza places around these days, I hope Grazie strives to do better in the future.",

    "text": "Ok, so before I go out to any new spot I always check Yelp. I am honestly surprised by how good a food rating Grazie got on here! We went in on a Sunday at 8, so we were seated promptly. That was nice since we brought our 16 month old son. The atmosphere is cozy, and warm- it feels like a place where you would want to celebrate and enjoy a bottle of wine. They even had a cute patio.  Our server was polite, offered us a taste of the bottle of wine before we decided- and overall was attentive enough to our needs with out being overbearing. Service was prompt, and even though we ordered an app and dinner at the same time we were given enough time in between to not feel rushed.  That is where my experience turned. We ordered the Bruschette Miste, and overall we were disappointed with the quality. The portion was good, but the italian sausage and cheese was overly spicy, the pesto was flavor-less (as was the white bean), and the tomato was only diced tomato. We drenched them all in balsamic and waited for dinner.  For dinner we got the Dame Edna(a pizza) and Melanzane Parmigiana (eggplant) to share. We were pleased with the pizza. It had a fair amount of prosciutto, and arugula piled on top- it looked beautiful and tasted good. All of the flavors were bold and still complimented each other very well. The eggplant parmigiana was sadly a very different story. The presentation, again was very nice, but the flavors were not there. The eggplant was totally overshadowed by the breading which was heavy and thick. The red sauce had good flavor, but was somewhat sparse leaving the whole dish dry and unappealing.   For dessert we had the Calzone.. ok, this was yummy. It came out warm, and the nutella and banana are a delish combination. The regular size was plenty to share between 3-4 people.. even though there was not a bite left on the plate! This was a highlight of our meal- but it is something you could recreate somewhat easily at home.  Overall, there were bright spots in the meal- the pizza and desert were both yummy, but I think I am going to be trying somewhere different the next time we are in the mood for Italian or Pizza.",

I felt bad for him because we one of those obligatory token drunk girls (not the bride-to-be, thankfully) with us being completely loud and obnoxious .. he just smiled pleasantly and did his job - Kudos to Tommy!  The ambiance is nice and it was a nice setting for our little intimate event.  The menu was quite pizza-centric, but when is that a bad thing?  I liked how their crust was really thin and crunchy and they had quite a selection of pizzas and wines.  Note however that when one of my friends ordered 'just a merlot', the waitress (another girl helping out) brought out a $10+ glass of Merlot.. not the 'house' Merlot, but a premium Merlot.  Nice job there.  Here's where the minus stars come in: -1) Ordered a macchiato.  This was bitter and astringent, a sign that the beans were under-extracted. -1) Our Toscano pizza was not impressive with the flavor nor the ingredients... it lacked in unity and harmony of flavor. I think I could give this place another shot, however... since I rarely venture in to Scottsdale for dinner, I'm not sure I'll get another chance in the near future.  In short, I've had better and it was OK for me.",

I'm pretty sure I called at 6:45 on a Friday and they had a table for me at 8...perfect amount of time to fix my makeup and walk over.  We arrived at a very busy, yet almost casual vibe.  I gave them my name, and we were seated right in the middle of the restaurant(and right in the middle of the action).  Now let me preface by saying I am kind of a snob when it comes to seating in a restaurant.  If they put me all the way in the back, anywhere near the bathroom or kitchen doors, I will usually tell them I will wait at the bar with a cocktail while I wait for another table.  But tonight, I felt like we lucked out with the best table in the house!  Once seated, we ordered a nice bottle of Cab, and the sausage bruschetta for $10.  Shortly after, we ordered the Complimenti alla Mamma pizza, which consists of Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Ham,Salame, Parmigiano Reggiano for $15.  After waiting for what seemed like a longer amount of time than normal for an appy to arrive, the pizza came to our table.  When we brought the issue up to the waiter, he had totally forgot to order it, and immediately put it in for us, and on the house.    The pizza is to die for.  Since then, I have ordered this pizza for take out, and it is amazing every time.  The ricotta is fresh and delicious, the salame and ham bring a saltiness to the pizza, and the crisp crust makes it the best pizza I have had in Arizona.    The total came to $36, not bad for a whole pie, appy, and a nice bottle of red.    I will be walking my little arse here again and again to enjoy this lovely, wood fired pizza.  Only thing is, I dont know if I could even try a different pizza than the Mamma....IT IS SOOOOO GOOOD.  OMG Nom I'm hungry now.  Salivating.  Arrrgg.",

Nothing.  A favorite is to grab a table by the outdoor fire place under the twinkling lights this way we can have our service animal with us in her carrier.  Maurizio is a fabulous chef and Sandy makes everyone feel as if she has known you her entire life.  Guests are treated kindly - and recently Grazie added Russell as chef and we are in a food coma from the last three things he made for us; Fra Diavolo, Chicken Masala and tonights ticket to paradise; the chicken Parmesan chased with a real tiramisu!  The desserts are off the chart.  So, come and bring your friends.  Kick back, sit inside or out - and prepare to be transported to a little slice of heaven.",

    "text": "Hmm, a bit disappointed. I had been here several times when I used to live in Scottsdale, but that was 3+ years ago, and I must say that I think things have gone downhill here. The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didn't work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta.   Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know.   I sort of liked the red sangria, but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria, as it was pretty sweet and not very strong.   I am sorry, Grazie. I am spoiled by having had the best pizza on earth in Chicago and am too excited to try the other acclaimed pizza joints in Phoenix/Scottsdale to return to your restaurant.",

    "text": "Meh.. The pizza is barely decent and all 3 times I have been here, part of the crust was burnt to the point were it could not be eaten. Twice with family (they picked the restaurant, once with my fiancee).  The first 2 times with family. The service was decent, until the owner of the place, not only ran out of the wine that my fiancee asked for (Resiling), but in a sad attempt to cover it up, tried to redirect her choice of wines by saying that the Reisling they serve would be much different from what she was used to; as if the owner knew anything about my fiancees experience in wine. After my fiancee declined the few wines the owner kept trying to push, the owner finally admitted that she was out of Reisling. All this over an insulting 3 minute period?  On to the pizza. Burnt Crust and uninspired changes to a centuries old tradition.  We visited this place after coming back from our 3rd trip to Italy (sicily, Rome & Naploli) and wow. Why reinvent the wheel?  Italy has a ton of pizzas, all with individual names. None of the regular Italian named pizzas match up with what they serve at Grazie. They changed everything. An Americana pizza for example has french fries on it. (Strange to us, but normal in Italy. Just an example though) Everywhere in Italy, no matter where you go, if you order an Americana, you will get fries on your pizza. Not so at Grazie. Oh, they have an Americana, but rather than fries, it is completely unrelated to the Italian standard. They made up their own pizzas and named them after typical pizzas found throughout Italy. Nothing matches up.  I ordered the cinque formaggi (in Italy it is the quattro formaggi) Terrible. The entire bottom was burnt, and the cheese was covered in a thin layer of grease. A hint that they use cheap cheese.  Insults, burnt crust and a flare for unoriginal pizzas with the wrong names? No thank you.. I honestly would prefer Papa Johns pizza over this atrocity.",

    "text": "Oh where to start..... Went here last weekend on a Friday and the place was maybe 10% full. Yet I was asked why I did not have reservations. *looking around* are you serious?? They had like 20 plus tables that were not even a third were filled throughout the whole evening. The patio had so much potential, however having no lighting I was not the only one struggling to see the menu. By the end of the night we were lit by a cell phone glow of people around us trying to read their menus. How romantic!  Drinks: The extremely watered down sangria that tasted like white grape juice with A SINGLE canned peach slice stuck to the bottom. Just nasty. Even the water smelled like mildew and I didn't dare touch the dried out lemons.  Appetizer: My fiance ordered the Fiaggi Misti (meat and cheese assortment, supposedly) It consisted of Oscar Meyer look a like garlic bologna, even worse \"sopressatta\" that looked like a hunk of fat, and two choices of tiny pieces of dried out cheeses. Oh yes, let us not forget the store bought bread sticks brought out in their packaging still, on top of the assortment still in the damn wrappers, stuck between 3 kalamata olives. What the hell do I do with all the wrappers now? Beyond disgusting. Worst part is that they charge $15 for the damn thing!!   Dinner: Now I enjoy my pizza well done. I just do. Don't ask, just make it happen, ok??! The Toscana pizza that we ordered, was neither well done, and had Wal-Mart quality ingredients. Terrible mozzarella, soggy whole mushrooms, and bland sausage with zero fennel, whatsoever. The sauce was more of a bland paste than a sauce.   Waiting 35+ minutes for the bill when asked several times ensured the zero likely-hood of us ever returning. EVER. But with two servers for the entire place, what did we expect?",

Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.    Wine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.  I'd be a regular if living in the area.",

Not only did she not know the menu, she offered up a split check when we knew better and were prepared to pay one check. The topper is she couldn't handle splitting the check and freaked out/cried. We did not get it?? Why offer??  Bottles of wine and orders were messed up to a point she started avoiding our table. I am super surprised the owner (yes you behind the wine bar) did not step in sooner. It was a giant mess and an embarrassment to speak so highly and to have the service turn out so terribly.  Your food and wine selection are great, but I hope you fix how you assign new servers. We would have preferred one of your daughters for a big table like ours!  You are not the only place in town with decent pizza. We would appreciate if you could get your service staff together so we can trust your place again!",

They roll out their pizza dough with a rolling pin.   Everything else about the pizza was spot on.  The sauce, the cheese, the toppings.   But,  the dough.  They kill it.  Repeatedly. With a pin. Sigh.  Go for the pasta and bread.  Leave before the pizza.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Grazie while staying at a nearby hotel. Things started off really well, but the fact that we were the only ones in the restaurant should have been a hint.  We each ordered a pizza - the waiter (who was also the one to cook the pizza) repeated back our order, which was not at all complicated...just a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza. However he brought me my cheese pizza and never returned with my boyfriend's pizza. Not only that, but he proceeded to sit at the bar and drink with someone else who I believe was the owner or manager, and they watched a soccer game and completely ignored us.  We finally got his attention and just asked for the check, and went to a different place down the street to get my boyfriend's lunch. If we ever stay in this area again, we will definitely be avoiding this place. Zero customer service.  And for what it's worth, my pizza was burnt.",

They were way ahead of the game years ago with delicious pizzas and salads that smacked of genuine Italian authenticity and could be counted on for a nice meal.  It's been a few years though since visiting snd tonight I ordered a pizza to go. Simple stuff.   We ordered the the \"Sofia\" which the menu said included Smoked Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto. I specifically asked for a well done pizza.   The pie we received for almost $20 however was a tasteless disappointment. The prosciutto was sliced so thick that it was literally like luncheon meat on the pie - heavy and inedible. I've never seen prosciutto on a pizza sliced so poorly. It was globbed all over the pie haphazardly - a mess.   Our pie was underdone - not well done.   The dough was bland and flavorless.  I feel bad because Grazie used to be dependable and was a charming place. Now - it feels like it's winding down and over.   The pizzas at North Italia are far superior.   Cibo downtown (who apparently used to be partners with the Grazie owner years ago) is eons better than this once delicious dining spot.   Ciao Grazie, we won't be back.",

Okay, but could you please slap some pasta and tomato sauce in a small bowl for the toddler at least.?! No, apparently this was too difficult. An hour and 10 minutes later we finally get our food. We were apologized to numerous times, but really?? It's a Friday night in Scottsdale...you should know you were going to be busy. Maybe throw in a free desert or something for our long wait. Food was alright...chicken parm and margherita pizza were tasty. The eggplant parm ordered was already sold out by 730pm. I had to settle for a spicy pasta dish that was mediocre. And the toddler dish seemed like it could have easily been slapped in a bowl 70 minutes prior. For the lack of service, please go elsewhere. Plus, you can find much better pizza elsewhere.",

There was nobody there to greet us, so we sat ourselves after having trouble finding a clean table.  After a few minutes the waiter came by and tossed a couple menus on our table.  We sat for 15 minutes and finally got up to leave.  The waiter approached us as we were leaving, so we told him we had been sitting for 15 minutes with no service.  This is when it got interesting as he proceeded to tell me how busy he was and was confrontational with me and even questioned my intelligence!  Pretty crazy and very unprofessional treatment.  Needless to say, we will not be back and would not recommend!",

I am a big fan of that 5 cheese pizza... the sweet, mild ricotta, provolone and the tangy gorgonzola are a hit with the usual mozzarella and parmesan.  If you see one, pick up the Groupon for a pitcher of sangria and pizza for only $15; its a steal!!  We've had their red sangria on both visits and I'm not sure we'll ever be brave enough to try the white ... the red is that good!  There's no music that I recall and only one small tv, so its nice to not have your date distracted by a sporting event. ;)  Its a small restaurant, but they have lots of patio seating that is sure to be a hit with the weather cooling off!  Highly recommend this spot for date night or casual dinner with a group of friends.",

The Tortilla Factory was closed but Grazie was just down the street. Knowing he'd had his heart set on Mexican, I stood and examined the menu outside trying to decide whether to keep walking. Just then a car pulled up, then a couple got out and walked past me. A second later, though, the gentleman turned around and came back to tell me, \"Everything's great here. You should try it.\" Sold.  I ordered a panino, then went to sit outside on the patio while I waited. There was a fireplace on the far end, and I could see how it would nice to sit outside on a cooler evening. The proprietor brought my check and promised the panino would be ready soon. He was right, and I was on my way back to the hotel after a few more minutes, switching the takeout container from hand to hand because it was so heavy.  The Romano panino was enough for us to share and was really tasty. The pizza crust-like flatbread sandwiched mortadella, provolone, and sliced tomatoes. There was even a little side salad and some olives, which was a nice surprise.   I'd love to go back here to put the rest of the menu to the test, but I have a feeling that gentleman was right when he said, \"Everything's great.\"",

We ordered the Giardiniera but was told they were out of the grilled vegetables as the truck had not yet come in so we had to settle for the Vegetariana.  The pizza oven had not been turned on yet so it was quite a wait.  The pizza was quite bad... crust was soggy in the center and the outside crust started out slightly crispy but turned soft like bread within minutes.  Worst of all, the bottom was caked with a lot of the black ash from previous usage.  We don't mind a little as is atypical of wood-fired ovens but this was a lot that dominated and killed the taste.  The onions were overly sweet like sugar had been added.  There was only 1 other couple in the place but the service was under par as well.  Our water glasses were not refilled.  Thankfully, we were not asked if we wanted a box for the leftover pizza.  There was a large puddle of water in the hallway close to the restrooms.  Frankly, we don't know what the explanation is for this poor experience.  We see all the good reviews.  We will not be returning to or recommending Grazie.  The owner who was serving us was nice and pleasant.",

Endless!!!!  See The AZWinebats and Grazie were hosting a wine event that was only $20 for 8 wine tastings and endless amounts of pizza and salads.  I started off with a free sampling of the Bruschetta Salsiccia, which was Italian Fennel Sausage with Melted Provolone Bruschetta YUM! I then had another bruchetta that was a cream cheese base with some sweet carmelized onions, red peppers, and seasonings which was equally as good as the Bruschetta Salsiccia. From there I moved on to the fabulous pizza that varied from the Margherita, Vegetariana, Americana, and Toscana. With all that pizza plus the yummy salads that they had to choose from where were the Emiliana and the Cesar, see now you realize why I am still full. I pigged out like there was no tomorrow. The Vegetariana won me over because of the sweet carmelized onions. Double yum!  The wine tasting was pretty good with my favorite being the one from Bigi called the Orvieto Amabile. It was a sweet white wine and that is just how I like my white wines. My next favorite was the Rosso di Podernovo from Castello Dell Regine and rounding it out with the Sangiovese Riserva from Umbeito Cesari being my favorite red and was also the last one on the list. The one that I did not like was the Brut Rose from Hello Kitty. Not a favorite but hey you can't like them all now can you?  My favorite part of the day was the fact that my friend Mark T. surprised me by coming to this event. Especially since he lives way in the middle of BFE!! LOL sorry Mark. But seriously, it was a great surprise and I was so very happy that he was there. Mark you rock!!  The owner was fantabulous, the staff were fantabulous, the food was fantabulous, the company was AMAZING!!! (thank you again Mark)What can I say, I am a happy and very full woman. (hmm pizza and wine drool....)  PS! The next event is Feb 28, so if you are in the area, by all means check it out. For $20, you can't beat it!",

The calzone is the best I ever had (and I'm from NY and don't really even love them). The Edna pizza (arugula, proscuitto, and shaved parm reggiano) is wonderful. Great crust, everything is just YUMMY!",

It is somewhere I have highly recommended since and will certainly visit again.",

After we sat down it took 15 minutes before we were greeted. We literally had our order ready and waiting. Anyways, the food was great but the service was sloppy: I was served wine before my girlfriend, they did not bring a chiller for the bottle, and our server was MIA until the check came.   They can definitely be a legit spot, but they just need to clean up there act.",

The wine prices are super cheap, in part because they sell wine for retail prices, and they'll usually let you sample a few wines before you pick your bottle for the evening.  For food, I love the house salad with gorgonzola dressing - I'd buy the gorgonzola dressing by the bottle if I could. For pizza, the vegetarian or the 5 cheese pizza are both great - if you love cheese, definitely go for the 5 cheese (cinque formaggi).  We've been a few times now and will be back again soon.",

I thought I'd order a Sangiovese as it was lunch, and I wanted something light. They brought out 3 wines to try and we ended up going with a Tuscan Cabernet blend which was terrific.

We were hungry late one night and Grazie had been recommended by a friend.  As we arrived we realized they were nearing closing time and asked if we should come back another day.  The staff insisted, \"No, no.  Come in.\"  I'd had a bad experience in a similar situation at another restaurant in the past, so I was still a bit hesitant.  But, decided to give it a shot anyway.  The staff at Grazie was top notch.  My wife and I received great service, the hour being completely irrelevant.  Heck, our server even broke out his smartphone and looked up a nearby late night frozen yogurt shop for us.  Five stars for service, Grazie!",

I was visiting some friends, and Yvonne has lived in Scottsdale since she was a toddler, and she strongly suggested a visit here. She knows I prefer ma n pa places over large shiny corporate owned restos. Well she nailed it on this small friendly family run outfit. We arrived close to closing time on a Friday night, so it was a very relaxed vibe with the few remaining patrons and staff chatting with each other and us. The owner(?) lady overheard a part of our conversation and joined in. Funny lady!   We desired just a late-night pizza, and Yvonne ordered the Capricciosa made with artichokes, Kalamata Olives, mushrooms, spicy salame, and ham. The wood fired crust was cooked perfectly and the crust was very flavorful. All ingredients tasted fresh and of high quality. One very tasty pie!   Great spot in Old Town Scottsdale.

It took over 1 hour to get the 3 different pizzas we ordered & when they finally arrived, 1 was charred to black and all were tasteless.  A person from our group expressed dissatisfaction with an individual believed to be the manager (an older woman wearing sunglasses) and her response was \"well, then don't leave a tip\". Wow! Terrible service and equally terrible food!",

Enough tomato sauce(lately I get too much cheese and not enough sauce very often), right thickness of crust, and stupendous ingredients in the right amount, meaning generous. I had the Capricciosa, which is everything you should want on a pizza...artichoke hearts, excellent Kalamata olives, ham, and salami, just right. The texture was a little \"wet\", as it should be. Truly a standard-setting pizza. My wife had the lasagne, also outstanding. Sat outside by the fireplace. So happy to have found this place. Waitress Jules made it all even better. Only our second night in Arizona, we shall be back here!!",

We had the Gardinera pizza, and they were very polite to to take the cheese off to accommodate our Vegan requests. The marinara sauce was sweet and fresh, and our veggies were delightful.  Our meat eating companions enjoyed a very delicious smoked mozzarella appetizer with mushrooms and prosciutto on top. I would have taken a picture, but the dish was already half-eaten by the time I got my camera out!  All in all, the service was very pleasant. Our server loved chatting art with me, and she gave us very insightful advice as to where else to go for our trip. The food was AHMAZING. Pizza connoisseurs will appreciate the love and craft that goes into each delicious slice.",

She was very clueless about the menu and kept forgetting what we were saying to her. To be quite honest it looked like she was high on drugs. She brought my salad and main course together first. Then she brought my husbands salad and main course together as well. We ate alone with our other 11 family members waiting on their food. She then started bringing one plate at a time with 10 minutes in between each plate. I've failed to mention that we were the only table there. So it took her about an hour to bring out 13 people's food all separate. We were all shocked. The worst thing of all was that the owner was sitting there at the bar the whole time and didn't do one thing about it. He was sitting there counting money and watching tv. Towards the end we waited for our bill for a while and she charged us incorrectly so we had to wait even more time until she got it right. When we finally decided it was time to complain the the owner started yelling at us like crazy. He told us to never come back again. That is exactly what we will do and I urge you to do the same.",

No where on the groupons did it say one per table ( I think they were for a pizza and some wine). The waitress gave us total attitude about using them. She finally allowed us to use 2 of the 3 ( we had 8 people).  It took her almost an hour to take our order and then she told us we could not leave off any of the toppings on the pizza because they only had one cook and she wasn't going to confuse him (we wanted mushrooms left off one pizza, difficult and confusing I know). After another hour we finally received our pizza. We decided to try dessert which took us another hour to get.  Never once did she refill my coke or offer drinks to anyone else at the table. At 9 we had to leave and could wait no longer for the check so we gave the group we were with some cash and left. They said it took another half hour at least for them to pay and leave. 4 Hours for pizza and dessert is nuts!!     The waitress gave us attitude the entire time. So much so that we are still teasing the girl who arrived there first about what on earth she could have done to have angered the waitress before we got there. PS. She didn't do anything, she didn't even have a drink when we arrived.  By the way I love dogs! I have had one all my life and even volunteered at humane societies. However, when I go into a restaurant the last thing I want to see is a dog sitting on a chair at the bar with his head on the bar. Gross!  Never again.",

    "text": "I went to Grazie for Valentine's day, which can often be a difficult time to be a vegetarian (with all the prixe fixe menus full of the romantically dead lobsters and cows).  My boyfriend had reservations for us at a wonderful vegetarian friendly place only to find out that they would not be offering a vegetarian option for Valentine's day.  (Nothing says \"I love you\" like \"you can't eat here\").  This left him scrambling to find another place to eat, and he stumbled upon the vegetarian friendly Grazie.  As we approached the restaurant, you could hear how full of life and energy it was, even for such a typically quiet, romantic night.  I'm not one for an overly stuffy restaurant, so I love it.  There was a beautifully lit patio that stretches around the building completed with a large fireplace on the side.  The wine list was presented first, which was actually something of a disappointment from someplace calling themselves a wine bar.  I'll drink just about anything, and I liked the way it was arranged, but they were definitely lacking in a few more options.  However, we did enjoy a nice glass of Spanish chardonnay that went well with our food for the evening.  To begin, we chose the cheese platter, which was worth every penny of the $15 price.  Unaware of what exactly to expect (the menu did not list the cheeses), we were pleasantly surprised to find the 5 or 6 different kinds of cheeses presented in generous portions.  This certainly was not the skimpy cheese plates I'm used to.  However, because there was SO much cheese, we felt that it was almost overkill without some tomatoes or bread to cut the the richness.  (I'll never complain about too much cheese though).  For our meal, we split the Marcello pizza, which was delicately seasoned with garlic and topped with Roma tomatoes.  The crust was thin and crispy and held up well to the rich sauce.  Overall, Grazie is a place that I would recommend and visit again for some indulgent food and a beautiful ambiance.",

    "text": "First, I would like to say that my husband and I have been here numerous times for dates, group parties, etc. Usually, both the food and service are wonderful, so I am hoping last night was an anomaly.   My husband and children took me to Grazie's last night for my birthday. When we first arrived, it was fairly empty, but it did seem understaffed. When our waitress came to take our drink order, she seemed a bit distracted. I overheard several tables next to us talking across to each other about how she had already messed up their drink orders or not brought them things they had ordered.   It took the waitress quite awhile to get back to us, but when she did my husband and I ordered salads, a Toscana pizza to share and a cheese pizza for our children to share. By this time the clientele had picked up quite a bit, and the waitress seemed harried. It took a long time to get our salads. When they came, my lettuce was limp, as though it had been sitting in dressing for a while, and the tomatoes were mealy and unappetizing. Next, when the pizza came out, portions of our children's pizza was black and burnt. However, we had waited too long at this point I did not want to send it back and so cut around the burnt parts for our children to eat.  As this was a birthday dinner, I wanted dessert, so when the waitress came I ordered ice cream for the kids and and a desert for my husband and I to split. We waited 25 minutes. My children's ice cream came but My husband and I still had no dessert, so I went to find the waitress. I asked her if it was on the way and found out it hadn't even been cooked yet, so I asked her to cancel the order and bring us the check. When she came with the check, she was very rude, at which point I stated it would have been helpful to be advised how long we would be waiting so we could decide if we even wanted dessert in the first place, since we were on our way to the Botanical Garden light display. Then the waitress rudely asserted \"you have obviously never worked in the food service industry\" and began to lecture me. Then she said \"You can just not tip me then!\" And stomped off angrily. When she came back with the check, she proceeded to lecture condescendingly about empathy, at which point I was really angry and just wanted to leave and not spoil the plans my husband had made.  As I stated before, usually the food is very good here, and I can forgive a messed-up meal given that they seemed short-staffed. However, if this is the tenor of service we can expect from the wait staff, I am loathe to return.",

We, and the other patrons ate pizza with our COATS ON. Really? The pizza isn't as good as it used to be. And the service BLOWS.",

Our server was kind of new, but really made a good effort. Service was slow, but ok from that standpoint. But, they did forget my meal, and had to cook it after serving everyone else. Keep in mind a waitress verified our order prior to it going in. The meal came out and was inedible. Chicken Parmigiana was the worst, and others that had this meal had the same issue. Dry, leathery chicken. Our white pizza was not really any better. You could not bite through the crust or the meat. This is a shame since this little place has a nice atmosphere... I left feeling very nauseous. After our drive home, I'm even worse.  I would NOT recommend this place!",

Does not make sense with a wood fire oven that should crank out pizzas very efficiently. Way too heavy on the cheese and sauce. No basil on top. The shining element was the dough; however, it was uneven in flavor and thick/thinness. One slice was good, the other slice bland. I feel the best thing this place has going for it is the decor. I love the rustic feel and vibe of an old Italian restaurant. If only they could fix the food and service you would have a dynamic combo.",

They had great specials, like pear and cheese pasta, which was to die for and mussels which also were very good. Even for those who order shellfish in the desert.   Once the crowds thinned out, the service became so much better. But, it really didn't matter as this is a people watching restaurant.

Both thin crust, well done brick oven pizzas.  The sauce, the cheese and the dough were all very good. I personally liked the Napoli a little better, but both were great.     The dessert was over the top absolutely amazing.  We got their dessert calzone - Dolce Della Casa. OMG.  I wanted to get naked and rub this thing all over myself.  However, my wife and daughter wouldn't approve. I digress, the DDC comes to you in a huge calzone form and it's filled with Nutella, bananas and topped with rich vanilla ice cream.   It was amazing!

    "text": "We went on Friday night about 8:30 and found the place about 10% full... A far cry from my last few visits when we had to wait for a table. It was cold out, so we decided to sit by the fire on the patio. Looked around and none of the candles were lit on the tables... We lit our own. There was already a menu on the table when we sat down, not for us, it just happened to be at the table closest to the fire when we seated ourselves. Eventually our server made her way over to us, with no menus (or waters) and gleefully exclaimed \"oh, there's already a menu here... It's a lunch menu, but it's basically all the same stuff.\" Are my friend and I to share the same menu and choose items hoping they're \"basically the same\" as what's on the menu?? Seriously? Upon request, she brings us dinner menus and we order a coke and a diet coke. A good while later (remember, the place is essentially empty) she returns with our drinks... A diet coke and an ice water. My friend reminds her that she actually ordered a coke, not water. \"Ooohhhh that's right\" and she sets off to get the coke. She returns awhile later to take our order... We order the Bresaola salad and the Capricciosa pizza (first, we ask what kind of olives are on the pizza, she says black. So we ask to have no olives, add tomatoes instead). We also remind her of the coke which has yet to arrive.  About 10 minutes goes by and she comes out with our pizza. Our pizza? She sets it on the table and notices the look of confusion on our faces and asks \"did you order something else?\" I said \"Wow. Yes, the Bresaola\" she says \"that's right... It's on me, I'll be back with that\" I said \"okay, I'll take another diet coke and we also need silverware, napkins, plates and we are still waiting on that coke!\" So as we sit watching our pizza get cold right before our eyes... We notice it's covered in olives. Of coarse it is. But we are okay with it because they are not black olives, like she said, they are kalamata. Once we get everything we need (including the elusive coke, but not my diet refill) and take a bite of our luke warm pizza... Despite not being hot from the oven or what we ordered, it was still pretty tasty. Our appetizer arrives after our entree and it too is d'lish. I remind her about my refill.. \"Oh that's right\" she says. Again, WOW.  We decide on dessert... Tiramisu and a calzone filled with Nutella and bananas topped with vanilla ice cream and 2 espressos. The salad dishes remain on our table as she arrives with our desserts... But there's nowhere to set them down so we start sliding all our dirty dinner dishes around to make room for the new arrivals. Then she leaves, I'm assuming to get our espressos... Now why would I think that? We did only tell her once that we would like them. Indeed, I see her inside not making our coffees and so I get up, walk in and say \"espressos?\" And she again says \"oh yeah!\" (Wow) and brings them out and states that these too are on her. I ask for sugar for our coffees (really?) and the bill... It arrives and the salad and espressos were not on the bill but I do see what went wrong with our no olives request for the pizza, it says right below it \"86 the mushrooms\". Bummer. We love mushrooms.  I know this review is long and detailed, but to say we had AMAZINGLY BAD service is the understatement of the year. I'll be spending my money at Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco instead, where the food AND the service is always great!",

The interior is very small and has a cozy atmosphere, but for some reason the staff left the door propped open all night (and it was one of those rare freezing nights in Phoenix) which made it super cold - all the diners had their heavy outdoor coats still on.  Maybe that's a trick to get you to drink more and warm up?  The vegetarian pizza was very rich and flavorful, although the caramel onions were almost TOO sweet.  The 12 inch is a little small to split between two people, we should have ordered an appetizer to fill us both up.",

All three of the pizzas, my husband's, the one I sent back and the second one they brought me all had at least one-third of the crust burnt. And I mean burnt black. But that wasn't the worst of the taste issues. The cheese on the pizzas was so horribly salty! If we weren't so tired and hungry, we would have sent them back and left. After hearing such great things about this place, I was shocked at the poor quality of the food.",

The mozzarella was some of the best I've ever had.  My issue is with the service. Dinner was at 7. Our waitress, Victoria, failed to clear plates from the table, had to make it a point that they don't offer free birthday desserts because \"they get 2 to 4 birthdays a night.\" That's fine, but I'm sure every birthday table is dropping $200 or more on wine & food and you can't give out a small free birthday dessert?  The worst part of the night was waiting FORTY-FIVE minutes for her to tally 5 separate checks for 14 people. What should have been an enjoyable 1.5 half hour dinner turned into a 2.5 hour nightmare with some of the worst service I've ever received. Even the owner was sitting at the bar with a glass of wine on his laptop and ignoring the 3 birthday tables he had.  In fact, getting the check took so long that by the time we left we were hungry again, so we stopped off at Burrito Express & got great service!",

Came here recently with a large group- our server only took orders for 1/2 of the table- and it took over 30 minutes to get her to come back to take the rest. Literally 30 minutes of arm waving, which then turned into finger snapping (which I know is rude) and then eventually we went up to the bar to see if we could place an order there, which the rude owner said NO that we had to wait for our server(bullshit). We were about to call in and place a to go order at this point. Our entire table had their food and were pretty much done eating by the time we finally flagged her down. At that point, she told us it would still be a few minutes. Anyway, long rant/story short- our pizza arrived cold. I don't think it was necessarily our servers fault- the place is always super understaffed and accommodates too many large groups at once. They need to staff more people. Especially on a Friday night. During spring We will probably return- but only for date night.",

The service can be slow at times, but it's a great spot for a leisurely date night or dinner with friends. I absolutely love the twinkle lights romantically lighting the courtyard and the cozy and quaint vibe inside. The brick oven keeps the restaurant warm and smelling delicious. The customers are typically vibrant which makes this a lively spot but in a way that allows you to carry on a conversation without your neighbors listening in. For the food, I enjoy one of the bruschettas or bread dishes to start and for pizza, I love the Toscana which is mushroom and sausage. The pizza is thin crust and delicious. This is by far one of my favorite pizza spots and date night destinations in Old Town.",

The food: Absolutely delicious. We split an appetizer sampler and for the most part everything that was on the plate was outstanding. The prosciutto covered figs were great, as was the bruschetta. Then our pizzas came out and i must say it might be the best pizza i have had in the greater phoenix area. It was amazing. Desert was also good, but i don't really have much of a sweet tooth.

I have been wanting to go here for a while and finally went tonight.  the website brags about \"meticulously chosen imported italian ingredients\".  which is great, but you need to put in an equal amount of care and preperation.  this is the area grazie seriously lacks.    Ordered the charceuterie plate and a marcello pizza.  here is the problem.  the cured meats were cut extremely lazily.  learning how to use a mechanical slicer requires little training and a small amount of effort.  uneven cuts, on a mechanic slicer!! really??  not executing something so simple shows little care and pride.  when it was brought to our table i asked the food runner what meats we had.  he responded by giving me an akward look and stacking the side plates he had just put in front of us, and walking away.  i understand the cheap labor that is available in arizona but, come on.  at the very least they should be able to tell customers what they are about to eat.  also dont be afraid to top cured meat with a drizzle of quality olive oil and some cracked pepper, maybe a squeeze of a lemon, for the price and claims, i would expect it.    the pizza was fine, until a sliced tomato fell off the pizza and exposed its nasty underside of an uncored tomato.  again showing the lack of care and preparation.  carelesness like this tells me the guy making the pizza saw a huge tomato core he put on a pizza and just turned it over to not expose the core.  and to top it all off with the garnish was a basil sprig, stem and all, in the dead center of the pizza and nowhere else.    overall its ok.  for being in old town it should be better.  there are a lot of quality places to go.  this is not one of them.   grazie, you have a good place, now get your kitchen up to par.",

However, last night as my wife, son and mother-in-law made our way back once again we were disgusted as a baby German cockroach started crawling across our table from where our appetizer sat.  I was so disgusted, but out of respect for other patrons I stopped the waitress in the back and showed her the roach that I had smashed with my napkin.  Her reply was simply, \"oh, sorry about that\".  I was taken off guard at her carelessness and inattention to the situation.  I decided to walk around for a bit with my son and I started to notice the restaurant becoming less maintained. For example, the men's bathroom was destroyed, many of the track lighting was out throughout the restaurant, only half of the candles were lit on the table and dust covered almost every wine bottle at the entrance. I normally would have never paid attention, but the cockroach made me look at everything. Toward the end of the evening I was expecting to be compensated for the meal, but they only took off the appetizer and my beer. I was once again dumbfounded at the disregard for the situation. As I began to sign the check, we see another cockroach crawling down the wall next to us.  This time we all got up from the table and told another waitress who once again was numb to the situation. With that said, I can honestly say I would never eat there again and will take my business elsewhere.",

We ended up sitting on the Patio. Which would be nice in the summer or spring but , a bit chilly for Jan.    They had 2 heaters outside.  However, we were just a little to far away to feel them.     We ordered a pitcher of the red Sangria wine, which they said they were out, but alass when they saw how dissappointed we were they made more!     We were very happy about that so that gives them extra points.        However, the Sangria was loaded with ice and there was ice in the wine glasses as well which made us even more cold.  Skip the ice when it is in the 40's outside.    We had the large Capresse salad which was excellant...The basil and cheese were huge and very tasty. Pizza was absolutly divine! Great crust ,wonderful mushrooms , and excellant Italian Sausage.                                                                                      Bathrooms were clean and parking can be a bit of a challenge.   Lacks a bit of atmosphere. The busboys were very attentive i give them extra points as well they were really working hard.",

    "text": "This is a very popular place, albeit somewhat small, so I recommend either going early or preparing to wait a while for a table. The atmosphere and decor is rustic and interesting. That being said, let me comment about the food.      In a word: wonderful. I frequently begin with the Formaggi Misti, and assortment of cheeses served with grissini and kalamata olives. This is a teriffic appetizer to share!       This is usually followed with the Caprese salad - very simple, but the combination of tomatoes, fresh basil, buffalo mozarella, and extra virgin olive oil does it for me every time.       And if I hadn't had enough sodium, I order the Roma pizza - and extra-thin pizza with more kalamata olives, capers, and anchovies! My mouth waters just writing these lines about it...      Much has been written about the extensive wine list, but let me just say this...you can spend as much or as little; you can find something to satisfy any taste.       I have never experienced a bad meal or poor service at Grazie - in fact, more often that not the evening at Grazie is stellar.       Bottom line: if you're looking for an informal dinner with excellent wine choices, you won't do better in Greater Phoenix.",

I just wanted to let you know that last night was fun....No, really we had a good time and all.  You really shouldn't beat yourself up over last night, you were busy, there was lots goin' on ;) Again, it's no big deal.  Everyone burns a pizza...It happens.  And, yeah I know, bagged lettuce for a salad is easier then freshly chopped.  Hey, don't we all cut corners sometimes to save a bit of time?  Go easy on yourself....I know that you wanted to have better service, but it just didn't happen.  Your head wasn't in the game...Well, anyway, I may as well get to the point: This is awkward...I just feel like we need to go our separate ways....Stop, I know what you're gonna say, it's just better this way!  There'll be plenty of others that will come along and you'll have long forgotten me...These things happen!  I'll get by and try other pizzas and see what happens...We can always still be friends and happy for each other :) Anyway, I won't be seeing you around anymore, so just take care and have a great life....  :(",

It's picked up steam the past couple years and has made a name as a trendy spot to drink wine and eat gourmet pizza, so be ready to squeeze into a table if you come in a large group.   IMHO, it's worth it (don't hate on the acronyms, folks). The food is legit and the wine is good. Considering all the attention it seems like this place gets, it hasn't gotten a big head about it. The prices are more than fair and the ambiance is invariably on point. It makes for a great double date or group outing spot as a precursor to a night out in Old Town.",

    "text": "Ok let me start by saying that I've always loved Grazie and think the pizza is delicious and authentic to pizzas you can find in Naples, but over the years this place has just flat out gone down hill. Went there on a Saturday night and the place was fairly empty, which is odd since it's in old town Scottsdale. The pizza we ordered (just a basic margarita) took 45 minutes to arrive and to top it off, it was undercooked. This is when things got interesting. We told the waitress that the pizza was bad and she informed us that the pizza cook had gotten so drunk that they had to send him home so out pizza had been cooked by the salad prepper. She then offered to take half off the pizza. We were upset, but by this point were also kind of amused by it all and honestly appreciated the girls honesty. As we were leaving we noticed the owner sitting at the bar watching football. He didn't even acknowledge us. You would think in a restaurant that is clearly struggling (empty on a otherwise busy Saturday night) that the owner would have at least tried to do some damage control and talk to us. But no. He clearly doesn't care if his own restaurant succeeds or fails. So why should we? So with that we won't be back again. Which is sad cause it's been a fave of mine for past 5 years.",

I'm not a fan of the burnt taste on crust. Just about everyone at the table ignored the crust... unusual for our group. This does not detract from the pizza itself, which was very good.  2. They don't know how to pour beer. The only have 3 (I suppose it is a wine bar after all), but at least know how to poor it if you're going to serve it. We ordered at least 5 pints and each of them came with half head. Kind of annoying. Luckily the glass was chilled, so it was still cold once it settled.  The pizza is so good, the alla mamma is our favorite. The sangria was delicious, we downed a whole pitcher. I would definitely come back to this place in a second. The owners (I believe thats what they were) were very kind and welcoming. They took care of us very well and we were happy with our visit.",

    "text": "I drove from L.A. to Phoenix for an overnight trip last month.  It was a brutal couple of days.  When I arrived in Phoenix with a couple hours to kill, I decided to spend them with my dog, a book, and some wine, to unwind from the long drive.  I walked into Grazie late on a Monday afternoon and stayed for about two hours.  The place was more or less empty, and I got a nice table on the patio all to myself.  It was a very hot day, and the patio wasn't quite comfortable, but it was as well covered and cool as it could be.  I drank two glasses of white wine from the extensive menu.  Both were quite good, and suited to the weather.  It was a mostly pleasant afternoon, but a couple things turned me off to Grazie.  One, while I was clearly not allowed inside with my dog (never expected, of course), the owner or someone on staff had two dogs inside the restaurant, roaming around.  At one point, the dogs came out, checked out my dog, and then one of them peed on the concrete wall right next my table, a foot away from where I was sitting.  Come on...I love dogs, but that's just gross.  Two, my second glass of wine came with a small surprise - I took one sip and pulled a dead bug from my tongue.  I pointed this out to my waiter, who did, to be fair, offer to replace the glass.  I thought it would be a shame to throw out the wine and I didn't mind drinking it, but I also kind of figured I might get that glass free, or get another glass thrown in.  I guess when I said I didn't want the wine to go to waste, the waiter decided that was that.  That said, the waiter was perfectly nice, and I had a good time drinking at Grazie.  I left with a light buzz, which was great for that time of day.  If I lived in town the dogs and the bug might still deter me from coming back, but I can't say I didn't enjoy my visit.",

When you arrive at Grazie you notice it's sweet and quaint ambiance. It is a smaller place with a nice patio. All the servers and staff are really nice there. It is pretty laid back and casual.   The first time I came here I was with two friends. We opted for the red sangria, a salad to share, and the vegetarian pizza. Everything was really good and flavorful. The crust is amazing on the pizza!   I went with my parents last night and again we got the red sangria. The sangria is very good- not too sweet but not bitter. We got the Americana pizza (pepperoni ) and added sausage on it. We got the bread and oil. The bread was just room temp. bread and I wasn't totally impressed by it- it did it's job though. The pizza was OUTSTANDING! I am so glad we got the sausage as it brought an extra kick to the meal. I like Grazie a lot and can't wait to go back!",

Nice heaps of ricotta, peppers, and sausage on one and tasty prosciutto and arugula on the other.  The service was great--as it should be because the place was dead.

    "text": "I had lunch here, a few years now since my last time. The whole experience was worse than disappointing.  First Impression: a stubborn, moldy smell in the dim and dank dining room.   I ordered a salad, and my friend ordered the Caprese.  The salad arrived in a flash - and no wonder: there was no care taken with it at all.  Bell peppers were clumsily chopped, and I pulled out so many yellowed, thick, and rotting leaves from the baby greens that I finally had to call the owner over and send it back.    I ordered a small Caprese in its place.  The mozzarella was dry and rubbery - not at all the tender, moist, fresh cheese you expect in a Caprese - especially at these prices.  The tomatoes were overripe and breaking down, and the basil consisted of a sprig of tough, oversized leaves. Bland olive oil drenched the whole plate, and there was no seasoning at all.  Nine dollars for a nearly inedible plate of food.     I ordered a beer on tap, which came with a large head of foam, sitting well below the rim of the mug. I chose not to complain, since I never finish a whole beer, anyway.   All the time I ate, the unpleasant odor of the room did not diminish in the least.  It was about as bad a dining experience as I can imagine.  Had the quality of the food been excellent, I'd still have to remark on the prices, which are on the steep side.  But given the poor quality, I felt majorly ripped off.      As we left, I learned that my friend had the same complaint about his Caprese. We both feel the place has really deteriorated in several years' time.  Maybe the pizza is the saving grace, but I'm not giving the benefit of the doubt to an owner who is so lacking in respect for both his establishment and his customers.  I'll never go back.",

    "text": "Great space, our server was lovely, the other waitress who was working was very nice. It's a very clean, cozy spot for a restaurant with a beautiful brick oven. Unfortunately, my food was so bad that it seemed almost like a joke. Like somebody pouring salt in your coffee. Shockingly bad. I was pleased to see that there was a vegan option, (penne arrabiata), unfortunately, it was one of the worst meals I have ever had at a restaurant. How something can be that spicy, but completely lack flavor is beyond me. I don't understand how this person is employed quite frankly. I would be embarrassed to serve that in my home, much less at a restaurant claiming this to be my profession. It tasted like they spooned tomato paste out of a can, dumped in red pepper flakes, and called it sauce. The sauce was very thick and very red, and grainy. If you cook tomato paste long enough, it eventually loses that tinny flavor. They did not cook it long enough, and they forgot some key ingredients: water, SALT, sugar, herbs, spices, a little olive oil, garlic, maybe a little onion... I hope the chef was out sick and the bus boy had to fill in or something, because what I was served was unacceptable. I'm bummed because I really had high hopes for this place. They have a beautiful patio. I will say that my boyfriends food was very good. He ordered the carbonara. So, maybe they just need to put a little more thought into their arrabiata. Perhaps taste it before sending it out and ask themself if THEY would want to eat it. If the answer is yes, they need to get out of the restaurant business, because they don't know anything about food and don't care.",

    "text": "It makes me really sad to write this review as I have always had a pretty good experience at Grazie until recently. We decided to head there for Valentine's Day dinner on Friday night as we have done this now every year for the past 4 years....We arrived at 8pm and noticed it wasn't busy at all. There were about 10 tables or so (maybe less) that had people sitting at them so we got seated right away outside. Our server Johnny, placed our menus at our table and off he went....about 10 minutes later he comes back to take our drink order. My boyfriend had the larger and I had a glass of wine. He delivered those and brought us water and walked away....about 10 minutes later he came back to take our order. I had the Cinque Formaggi as I always look forward to this pizza and my boyfriend had the Margherita. I noticed the prices had increased but I was ok with it because I know it was going to be good. Off went our server and then nothing......he didn't come back to check on us or see if we wanted maybe another glass of wine, beer or even more water! 30 minutes went by and nothing yet....45 minutes went by and still no food! I am at this point starving as it is now past 9 and still no food, no server coming to check on us. Meanwhile, the table next to us (family of 4) ordered, ate and paid their check all since we had ordered. I even noticed the table of 4 behind us said, \"pizza was pretty good but the server has forgotten about us.\" I turned around and said at least you guys got your food! We are still waiting!! Our server came back and said my pizza was almost done...wait, what?!? Almost...this thing should have been done 40 minutes ago! We are going now on an hour ticket time and still the restaurant maybe had less than 20 people. My pizza comes out 5 minutes before my boyfriends so we ate at two different times and I had to ask for more water for my boyfriend as the waiter was walking off. Not once did he ask if he could get us anything, I guess I wasn't wanting to have another glass of wine with dinner because I now don't have anything but water. One thing I noticed is also how bad the pizza looked! For $17 I expect a pizza to have toppings on each piece! There were several slices that were not worth eating! At this point I'm so irritated at the horrible service and food I just wanted to leave. While our server Johnny was nice he didn't do a good job at waiting on tables, offering more drinks or even putting the orders in since it did take over an hour. I always look forward to going to Grazie's but after this experience I don't think we will be back anytime soon.",

The owner, Marcellio, introduced himself and explained his wine purchasing; good wines at a reasonable price....available for purchase by the bottle or case. The house Chianti was very good. Marcellio is from Italy and been here about 15 years. Also, Sandy, the chef helped me pick out a couple pizzas that were thin crust and cooked in a wood fired pizza oven. Really good pizza! The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and reminded me of dining in Rome a few years ago.",

After just a few visits you are greeted by Maurizio, Sandy and the rest of the staff (and some of the customers) as a friend of the family.  The pizza, is thin crust and cooked in a brick oven. I have had each of the pizzas and while I have my favorites (Dame Edna and Vegetriana) they are all really good! This is artisan pizza at its best!  The salads are good sized.  The Emiliana and Caesar are very different from each other and delicious.  The wines are all Italian and reasonably priced.  I have learned to LOVE Chianti!  Who knew it was a really good wine and not just for that stuff in the raffia trimmed bottles!  For dessert try the Dolce Calzone!  Bananas, Nutella and ice cream--WOW!",

I ordered a pizza from Grazie for pick up since its not far from where I live,and wanted to try something new. To my disappointment the pizza I ordered came out incorrect, folded over, and DRY AS A BOARD WHEN I ORDERED EXTRA SAUCE. So, I called the manager to let them know about the order, but was totally thrown off, as he had A COMPLETELY RUDE ATTITUDE, was highly combative, did NOT make any attempt to make it right and in fact said to me that if I were to go to the restaurant to show him the pizza that he would kick me out and call the police on me - and of course then hung up the phone on me. I've eaten out to eat for almost every meal since I was young, and I have NEVER been treated so poorly and for sure never threatened by a manager/owner (who was a male btw..) I don't like being negative, but what happened tonight was NOT OK.. I do NOT recommend this place to anyone. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, POOR MANAGEMENT, HORRIBLE PIZZA!!! Save your money and do yourself a favor by NEVER EAT AT GRAZIE!!!",

    "text": "The worst. !!!! We came not late on a friday so you wouldn't think they would have excuses for everything we asked for. They didn't have majority of basic ingredients (cheese)  therefore a lot of what we ordered we couldn't get. Then no banana either because oh they \"just used our last one \". But we will still bring you that dessert and add extra ice cream! Oh but since \"the freezer was opened too many times throughout the night it's all melted.\"! So it was poured onto the dessert anyway. Looked awful. Terrible presentation. They didn't even offer to comp the desserts or any of our meal!!!  Not great customer service if your wanting customers to return eh? Then took about 45 minutes to figure out splitting the bill   Like they don't do that often. Then finally when our waitress dressed in overalls and converse (not really a wine bar attire) figured it out she commented \"I did you a favor since it said no split checks for Parties over 6 people\". Rude .  Would not to back or recommend to waste your time or money at this place   Wish I had zero stars to give. Then I called to complain to the owner. He was not available of course.  I got a call back finally A WEEK later from our server!!!! She wouldn't let me speak to a manager or owner.  Hahahahaha.  She was instead making up excuses for everything I mentioned above including everything is fresh from a specific place in Italy yadayadayada and we run out of things often. Well if you want customers have what they want especially that early on a Friday . Im sure come Sunday night they have nothing on the menu! She kept rambling on about how hard being a server is blah blah . Yeah well lady im a pediatric RN and it's hard but I don't complain that to my patients like you do your customers!!!! it was a waste of my time to hear her I ended up hanging up. Haha. Would go to McDonald's for dinner over this place any night !!!! Don't waste your time here again.",

Basically, if I see the words \"Carpaccio\" or \"Bolognese\" on a menu, I'm sold.  I never claimed to be a discriminating Yelper.    In this case, the Bolognese in question was the lasagna.  It was so good!  It comes piping hot served in a bowl, so it's more of a deconstructed lasagna.  And there is a little bit of grease that floats up from the meat and cheese that you can mop up with your bread.  Hey, I *walked* to the restaurant, right?  The Carpaccio is also good and I have not had the pizza, but it looked and smelled delicious.  We will be back in Scottsdale next month and I'm already dreaming about that creamy and delicious lasagna!",

About 25-30% of the tables were empty. One man (a manager I believe) told us he would be right with us, so we waited about 5 min. Then a waitress came up to us and said \"I'm sorry, I don't think we can seat you, we are really busy.\" It was so bizarre- there were so many tables open and the kitchen didn't close for over another hour. We went an ate elsewhere, but it was really weird and kind of offensive just being denied like that.",

And its just not any pizza restaurant---their pizzas are made old school the authentic Italian way in a brick wood fire oven like it is done in Italy. We live in CA, but every time we come to visit my parents we make it a priority  to eat at Grazie. Our favorites are the Scamorza  (appetizer), Insalata  Della  Casa(salad), Sofia, Dame Edna, and the Dolce  Della  Casa (dessert). We just came back from visiting Italy and Grazie is the closest place that I could think of for authentic Italian pizza! LOVE THIS PLACE!",

Everyone knows about Pizzeria Bianco and Cibo...but for my money Grazie puts out pies that are just as good, if not better (dare I say).  I came here over the weekend and the pizza we decided on was the Complimenti Alla Mama: red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, ham, salame, and parmigiano reggiano. I'm not over selling this when I say it may have been one of the top three best pizzas I've ever had in my life.  I also enjoy the wine list as its very Italian focused, the service is pretty good, and if you're coming for the first time you can't leave without having dessert. Don't worry about picking one out, you have to order the Dolce Della Casa: slightly charred sweet calzone filled with Nutella and bananas, topped with vanilla ice cream.  In summary: I'm getting hungry just writing this review and I can't wait to go back.",

We ordered Toscana which has saussage as a topping. i found the tomato sauce sweet, the saussage tastless and pulverized, and most importantly the dough to be different than the old bubbly Artisan dough. we probably could have done better with a frozen pizza.  i also noticed the same tomato sauce on the amatriciana pasta. our server was fantastic and running everywhere taking care of all the tables with the owners just chatting. at one point we needed something and although the owners acknowledged this, they waited to point to the server to come and attend to us.  we told our server about the tastless pizza  and she was very appreciative of the comment but once again we were expecting an owner or a manager also to come and acknowledge or respond to the criticism.  this is not the Grazie we were used to.",

Service: the hostess was also our server and it was obvious she had no server experience. when we ordered 2 glasses of red wine she was not sure they had the one we had chosen, then she was sure they didn't have it and then she said she would check. after all that, she brought us 2 glasses of very cold Sangria. $18 for the wrong order done intentionally. but instead of me making a scene in front of family from out of town I decided to yelp this so the rest of you would stay away from this place!  Owner: a very rude man. you know the kind of service you get in Italy, Spain or even Greece? ya, that kind.  hey Mr. Owner, have you heard of the expression \"you can catch more flies with sugar than vinegar\"? perhaps this is why your restaurant was completely empty on a Sunday evening?? and your business is going downhill? perhaps?

    "text": "Ah!!!!!! Another great restaurant in old town Scottsdale. With its modern look and lighting this place is an awesome place to bring a date.    The Girlfriend and I came here for our monthly date night last weekend, after finding this deal on Groupon.  We were seated outside on the patio due to the air conditioner being down.  BOY WAS IT HOT, holy hell - good thing they had the misters out.  Not really a picky eater, I would pretty much devour anything that's enable. We ordered the Tuscan pizza, a pitcher of white sangria for her and a glass of beer for me. Not much of a sangria drinker either, the lucky GF had the whole pitcher to herself! (Talk about alcoholic)^_^  Our thin crust Tuscan pizza was amazing! Full of flavor in every single bite.  Our server was a little slow getting to us, but it was a really busy night.  All and all this place is awesome, and I really enjoyed our visit. Will definitely be back soon. ^_^ KCYE",

We started out with bruschetta to share with the table, then a salad (Emilia) two pizzas to share.  One of the pizza's was called Vegetariana and don't remember the other one.  The meal was fresh and flavorful.  The best thing about the resto is that the patio feels cozy and lovely.  I promise to bring cash on girls night out next time!  of course I did pay back the cash I owed the next day but felt bad that Ebony's friend took care of the entire bill.",

    "text": "This place get negative stars! I had to pick one star but it doesn't even earn one. Awful! We arrived on a Sunday evening, there were 2 other tables seated. There was a gentleman who worked there standing by the bar and another employee standing there and neither greeted us. We stood there for a minute before I asked if we should sear ourselves. The answer was yes.  We ordered a large salad for 3 to split with dressing on the side. Then we ordered 2 gluten free pizzas and asked if the 'classic lasagna' had cheese because it doesn't say on the menu. The waitress said there was.  45 minutes later we get a small salad with dressing on. Waitress apologized and offered to bring another but it took so long we declined.  30 minutes later our pizza came. One burnt the other was fine. A few minutes later the lasagna came without cheese. We never got refills and no one checked on us.  After awhile another waitress asked how our meal was and we spoke up and said, not great. She offered to get the owner. Well, watch out if you have a problem! We planned on just letting him know what happened and we were disappointed. He came to the table with his arms folded  (turns out he was the gentleman that was at the bar and didn't greet us either) asked what was wrong. We told him about the lasagna, the salad and before getting any farther he got defensive telling us his lasagna doesn't have cheese and if the waitress told us that, we shouldn't tip her. What kind boss tells you not to tip his employees??? We told him that's not what we wanted. He started getting defensive telling us it sounds like we do this all the time and HE never told us there wasn't cheese its our problem and kept telling us we don't have to tip the waitress and he's been open for 13 years of business and clearly he's been successful and it's us that was the problem.  I have never in my life experienced that treatment in a restaurant. I will never return here and I will tell people NOT to go here. I have no idea how they are business.",

    "text": "Judging from the prior reviews, I must've come in on a rough night. My boyfriend and I came to Grazie, for it was in walking distance of The Valley Ho. The food was truly delicious! We shared bread as an appetizer, I had salad, and my boyfriend ordered the Lasagna. The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the service was a train wreck, here's why. There were 5 tables outside, one inside (ours), and two people seated at the bar. Our waiter was handling them ALL, besides the bar, which was annoying since there were three other waitresses there who should have given him some help. All three waitresses were speaking to the two guys at the bar, twirling their hair and giggling like 13 year olds. I couldn't believe that they didn't assist the gentleman working. He asked them to bring us our appetizer while he ran food to a table on the patio, and they didn't. So, after staring at our bread sitting on the bar for three minutes, I walked over and grabbed it myself.  Our waiter saw and apologized on his way back to the kitchen, and then took it off our tab. The girls at the bar, weren't apologetic at all. He was so busy with all of his other tables, that the cook was kind enough to deliver our food to our table. Like I explained, the food was great. Then, when it was time to pay our bill, our waiter was still running food to all of the tables, so I asked one of the bar girls if they could grab my check. The response I received: \"Oh, your waiter will get to that when he gets a chance.\" Annoyed, we just left $50 on the table and walked out. I felt really bad for our waiter because, he was so polite and a very hard worker so I hope he enjoyed his $20 tip. All in all, I don't think I'll ever come to this spot again.",

The Salad was normal, served on a nice big plate with what appears to be homemade dressing.  Wine list is extensive, more so then I thought would be for a pizzeria.  It really is a wine bar and I must say I had the best glass of wine in my life, and I don't really care for wine.  The pizza was tastie, a little over cooked.  The crust is super thin, which I love but requires a watchful eye when cooked in a brick oven.  However overall the taste was wonderful.  The chocolate calzone was amazing!  Again a little burnt on edges, that is the main reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.  But a must eat for anyone that is a pizza lover!",

    "text": "Say hello to the place that has the second best pizza in the valley (Bianco is obviously #1).  I'm shocked that I did not know that this place existed and was very excited to have the opportunity to go here last weekend.  A great unassuming building with a great patio and a small interior space, this quaint little place dishes up some great pizza.  Thin crust with a wide variety of quality toppings (including smoked mozzarella, which is wonderful), the pizza comes out of the brick oven absolutely delicious.  If the pizza didn't already hook you, this place has a great selection of wines at reasonable prices.  You can order them with your meal, or order a bottle to go.  What more could you ask for?  The bruschetta was great, their salad was phenomenal, and they had one of the best tiramisu that I have ever had.  Our server was very attentive and friendly (and cute to boot), the atmosphere of the place was perfect for dates and groups, and I can't wait to come back here.",

It's in a great location with great potential but the owner/manager is not doing their job. This place was a complete let down!",

They had no tap beers, which is pretty lame as it is the perfect compliment to pizza. They had a nice brick oven which seemed promising. Sadly they ruined the pizza by busting out a rolling pin on it and thinning it out to a cracker like crust. My wife had the veggie and I had the sausage and mushroom. They were decent. But, again they need to hand toss the crust as it was way too thin.",

There is only one wood-fired oven, so when the place is packed it is illogical to assume the pizza will come out fast.",

The last visit we had some new ones and ended up taking advantage of the retail wine sales end of the business to buy a couple we particularly liked.  The prices are very reasonable. In addition, if you make it clear that you are interested in wine you can have good conversations with owner or staff. The food isn't remarkable though we enjoyed what we had: bruschetta with sausage for me and some kind of dried meet appetizer for wife. Other times we have had pizza or calzone. Last time we had dessert calzone which involved pastry, chocolate, banana and ice cream.  We like the place and will continue to patronize.",

For starters, try the Bruchetta and/or one of their salads. The salads are all great, particularly the Caesar and Emiliana, and are big enough for two people if you are going to order an entree or pizza too. I've enjoyed several of their pizzas and would recommend the Margherita (add garlic if you are a garlic lover), Quattro Stagioni and the Americano.  Along with classic Italian fare, Grazie has a massive wine selection all from different regions of Italy. My girlfriend and I are particularly fans of the Le Cupole 2005, a red wine blend of Merlot/Cab Franc/Cab Sauvignon/Cesanese/Petit Verdot from Tuscany. The servers are usually pretty happy to let you try different wines before buying a bottle. Just ask.   We will continue to be fans of Grazie.",
