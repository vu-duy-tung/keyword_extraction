The atmosphere is ok but it's just like any other quick service chain restaurant, except it seemed over staffed but that didn't help with the food quality or time it took to get our food.   Three of us decided to get breakfast one morning and spent over 40 dollars on stuff that would have cost less than 20 at Denny's, and more like 5-8 dollars at Safeway.   My '12 ounce Americano with room for cream' was filled up just a little past the 4 ounce point. I had to send it back because it's not what I ordered and my friend sent back her Carmel latte.   All our food was cold and took a long time to get to our table, not to mention it was bland and flavorless. How do you mess up 10 dollar eggs, fruit and toast? I'm not sure, but they managed to pull it off.   SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME. GROSS. SAD. EXPENSIVE. SLOW.",

Employees were sitting around eating at tables right out front while numerous empty tables remained unbussed with dirty dishes and leftover food. The servers were completely unprofessional. I mean I couldn't tell what area was designated for customers and which area was the kitchen area for employees only. When I approached the register, none of these same employees ( who were sitting and eating) bothered to try to help. Finally, someone did bother to ask if I needed help. I had ordered ahead for takeout, otherwise I might just have left. I also ordered a hot tea. The hot water dispenser on the coffee maker was painfully slow. So, the server filling my tea cup decided just to fill the rest of my cup with water from a huge plastic pitcher that was sitting under the hot water dispenser!!! What???? I mean it didn't look like a sanitary pitcher. Looked more like something used to collects dripping water. I wish I could better explain the overall feeling that I got that there is a total lack of sanitation or discipline in this restaurant. I'm really not that picky. But, this place is just gross. If this type of stuff is happening in front of customers, I wonder what goes on in the back where I couldn't see. Do yourself a favor and head elsewhere.",

Unfortunately, it was none of those things. Well, first it's downtown Phoenix so I can forgive the small town thing. But no good yeasty smells and the food was below mediocre. I had the broccoli cheddar soup. The taste was ok but it was so watery. I also had the southwestern chicken salad. Again watery. (Interesting phenomenon for the desert...) and tasteless. So watery that I could not taste the ranch dressing that was supposed to be on it and had to get some more and it STILL was watery. Watery and pretty tasteless.  All in all very disappointing.  Will I eat there again? Nope.  Too bad-it's a great location for ASU students and others strolling around downtown but I can't imagine that they'll stay in business for much longer with less than mediocre food like this. Going back to Paradise Bakery for the broccoli cheddar soup-now that is rich and creamy!",

Anywho, the Arizona Center location we went to that Saturday, was inundated with a long line of people, mainly women (found out there was a women's convention taking place, and it was the lunch break). My friend was concerned the quality would not be as good because of the many patrons but I maintain the belief that if you're a good resto, regardless of how busy you get, your quality and service should not slide. Anyways, after a 40 minute or so, wait, we ordered. I got a Southwest salad, the cheddar broccoli soup, and a maple pecan bar. My friend got the Pesto Cavatappi. We opted to sit out on the patio since the weather was gorgeous, and waited for the food to be delivered. Upon receipt of our food, my friend noticed her pasta dish was lukewarm and not hot, so, it had to be sent back. The bread served along with my soup was cold and wasn't worth eating, the salad was not that great especially since it was drenched with dressing, it might have been wrong for me to assume but many other places I've been to, the dressing is usually served on the side as to allow the diner to decide how much dressing they would like to use. The soup was okay, nothing exceptional. The only good thing was the sweet because the maple pecan bar was moist, and not too sweet. It was around 1:50pm and I was gonna go back inside to refill my drink and found the doors leading to the patio were locked, so, I went to the front and found the doors locked and that was at 1:55pm (they close at 2pm). I kept on knocking and even called them through my phone a couple timee, so, I could tell them i was at their patio and wanted in, so, i could refill my drink. After what took close to 7 mins of constant knocking, a customer in the resto saw my debacle and let me in. As I was refilling my drink, I approached the server, who had delivered our food to tell them of the locked patio door. Her excuse was that someone should have told us that sitting on the patio can possibly get yourself locked out if you're there within the last hour before closing. I'm gonna  be honest and I find that it's outrageous they lock their doors without checking their patio to see if they have patrons sitting outside, and I think it's stupid to have a patio and restrict people to where they can sit an hour before they close. Personally the food is not that great, service was lackluster, and the overall quality was just BAD. Will i ever consider coming back? I think not, and lastly, do something about your patio situation, it doesn't make sense. Oh, and this is proof how it's a crap resto when they're unable to maintain food quality, and service at their busiest periods. It's a shame.",

By the time my group got their food - the meeting was over. Called afterwards to speak with the catering manager and was told she wasn't in so they took my info for a call back....called back and she's gone for the day.  At this rate they won't be there long and they've lost a huge book of business from me. I'm not going to say beware, I'm saying DON'T BOTHER AT ALL.",

Once the food arrived we asked for forks and got a very strange look form the server...about 5 minutes later we had our forks. The Anaheim was actually pretty good but the Chicken Apple sausage was straight from the freezer section of your grocery store, yuck!

I ordered a sandwich combo- a 1/2 uptown turkey with a mixed greens salad, a bag of chips came with it and a raspberry tea. My husband ordered a 1/2 chicken salad sandwich and a cup of cheddar broccoli soup with lemonade to drink. The service was excellent, the food delicious, the patio where we chose to sit is a nice place to sit if you don't want to sit inside the restaurant. We chose to sit outside to enjoy the coolness of the weather. My husband returned to buy a cookie and was given one on the house. (My husband always wears his retired Navy ball cap) so I don't know if it was because of his hat or not but it was unexpected and appreciated by us.  My husband has ate breakfast at this location previously and enjoyed the food and service. I should also mention their restroom facilities are clean. The employees that work there care about their customers. The young lady cleaning the tables outside kept the tables bused and came and cleared our dishes away. She was friendly.

The first visit I got the chicken noodle soup and southwest flat combo. The soup was good, pretty standard chicken noodle. The southwest flat doesn't look very impressive (they're pretty small), but it was surprisingly delicious and seemed bigger once I started eating it. Lots of chicken and the bread is really good.   For the other lunch I had an entree version of the Spinach Sweet Crisp salad. Though the $8-9 price tag seemed a little bit hefty for a salad without protein, it was good - lots of fruit, and the goat cheese and toasted cinnamon bread croutons made it more of a meal.   Overall, the food is good and fairly fast. Lots of seating and in a convenient location. The one gripe I have is that I couldn't find an outlet to plug my computer into. For a place that would cater well to the afternoon coffee/working lunch crowd (they have free wifi), it seemed like there would be outlets at some of the tables, but there were not.",

When we sat down to wait for our food, other groups were brought oatmeal. I found something different to order but my latte was very bland and it seemed they forgot to put the flavoring in it. The coffee station did not have the bold flavor available for 30 min. After 25 min, I went up to the counter and asked whether our numbers were ready, they said that they were still making them. Although it was only scrambled eggs and a few pieces of bacon.   Still 30 minutes later, food has not arrived... which prompted me to start writing this review. The corner bakery in Hinsdale Illinois, which I have been to in the past, has never treated customers like this. We ended up going to the counter to get a refund and cancel our orders. Another worker apologized and said they are usually understaffed. She gave us a full refund and offered us some fruit to go. #paneraitis",

When we arrived just before 6pm it seemed strange there was only one other person in the cafe at dinner time for so many. First impression should have told us to leave. The cafe did look clean so I gave it one star for that. We Couldn't get the sandwich we wanted because they were out of chicken. Ok, no big deal, had turkey instead. $18.00. Seemed a little high for two sandwiches and a cup of soup when I saw the sizes of the servings we were brought.  I almost ducked as the server plunked our food on the table and walked away without a comment. With four of us at the table it was a shuffle as we had to figure out what was what and who got what. The servers attitude and sour face told us she didn't want to be there and wished we would leave also. My sandwich looked like a child's size sandwich and came without any dressing or flavor. The cup of soup wasn't hot but the other grilled sandwich was. So now I know why so few stars. I won't be back. It's a shame this restaurant isn't acceptable because it's cute and in a nice busy area.  Oh, I forgot, they were out of the bread my sandwich was suppose to be on.",

Bakeries should smell like delicious food and the place should be spotless. Even in Chicago, it isn't always perfect but it apparently is markedly better than this location.",

When I stopped and spoke to the manager, she was extremely helpful explaining to me the different packages available and what would work best for my situation.    I'm not typically one to use delivery, because I want to know it's there when I need it, but after I told her we'd be picking up a rental and flying by to grab everything at 8 AM the next day, she asked me again if I was sure I didn't want delivery.  I decided to take a leap of faith and it's a good thing I did!   Turns out the rental was not available and we had to Uber to the clients office at the last minute.   The delivery driver called me, I gave her the suite number and she took everything up, so it was ready to go when we arrived.   The client loved what we brought and we loved the service!",

I was excited to try it because it is similar to Paradise(which I like) , is a similar concept and they are building A Corner Bakery near my office in the Biltmore area.  For starters the Panini maker was broken so I ordered the Spicy Chicken Tortilla soup in a bread bowl which pretty much included like two tablespoons of soup, it really needs a side cup of soup as the bread bowl doesn't really hold a whole lot. The Bread bowl was tasty but the soup was just warm. They forgot to give us two cookies that we ordered and we had to go back up and ask for them, then they were out of the M&M cookies my sons wanted. We had to go back up to the counter and ask for forks. The kids meals were reasonably priced @ $4.95, The soft drink for $2.50 was not. The portions were somewhat small, my wife's sandwich & soup wasn't hot enough. Two Stars, would try again but won't be on my radar for dining choices.",

    "text": "Whenever I walk into this Corner Bakery Cafe, I thank my lucky stars that they decided to locate here at the Arizona Center. Previously, the only choice for a quick lunchtime sandwich/meal-to-go was Subway, and one can only tolerate that grub for so long. To this day, I cannot stand to walk into a Subway without getting a little bit nauseated.  So Corner Bakery Cafe fills the sandwich/salad/soup niche quite impressively. I usually get their grilled paninis which are perfectly crunchy and delicious. I also like the customer service here as they really try to greet you with a smile. Their Cinnamon Creme Cake is also truly indulgent--I was blown away when someone brought this to work and we stuffed our faces during a meeting. Shove this in your cake-hole and you won't be disappointed.  My only criticism is the Turkey on Pretzel Bread signature sandwich was not 100% to my liking. I feel that the bread could've been a bit thinner or softer, as not to take away from the other sandwich ingredients. And although it might've been due to the fact that this place was brand-new and hadn't worked all of the kinks out, I detected an off-taste that was a little bit chemical in nature. Maybe the bread, after baking, was wrapped too soon in plastic wrap--or something, but it was a little unappetizing. Other than that, I feel that Corner Bakery Cafe can do no wrong. I love coming to this place for lunch and consider them a welcome resident of the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.",

Are you kidding me?!!!  I've seen 3rd graders make a better sandwich.  It ended up basically just being two big pieces of bread and mayo.

Yeah yeah yeah, I KNOW what they say about those who chew ice. Since I've been chewing ice since I was five years old maybe I should seriously consider therapy.

The place was busy when I entered an I was lucky to find one of two empty tables. Server never came with my order and then the same server came over to ask if I was still waiting on my meal; which I said yes to. He disappeared and never returned. 22 minutes of waiting I take myself to the front to inquire. While speaking to another server, who should I spot, the original server now dealing with take out orders. I finally got my meal after close to 30 minutes and they forget to give me utensils and napkins. My lunch was good, Thank God but the service was totally off the mark for a Corner Bakery Cafe. Time the service wait.",

We also had the Anaheim Scrambler which was an exceptional meal, Great tasting and filling. The cinnamon roll was delicious and the cinnamon cream cake was very moist and not too extremely sweet.

I noted to the cashier that the open sign is turned off and she made no comment. Our table consisted of four people. Two of us were served first. My friend asked for his meal to be sent back so to wait so we could eat. After 5 minutes I was told they don't have bacon. The other table next to us just got up and left because their were being told that their orders were not available either. After they had already paid for them. I can understand though it's 51F and there was a little children with them. I decided to just order something else and it came out quickly however the food that came back from my friend was colder than when he got it. We figured they would've put it under a heat lamp. Who wants cold soup when it's 51 out? My girlfriend ordered a bagel with avocado and I came out with no avocado. Then when she went to go use the bathroom it was closed off. Overall the team was friendly but not being managed properly. The Dickton holds True there are no bad teams only bad leaders, and appears that the leader wasn't even present today. I gave two stars because our server was nice and trying to do her best.",

I brought it back to ask the employees if this was indeed a Chicken Carbonara, and they took it out of the bag and said it was. We've had this dish at other locations and it looked completely different. On their menu they listed the pasta to be linguine but the one we received was cavatappi. It's frustrating how they lied to us instead of admitting their mistake. We later looked at the menu once again and found out they gave us Pesto Cavatappi. What made it worse is the fact that it tastes like boiled noodles.",

However, as you have read in my prior reviews, customer service is my top priority. So lets begin....  The employee at the counter was great.  Friendly, gave suggestions, very helpful to everyone. Now as I was eating I watched as the manager approached a customer at their fountain drink area and aggressively asked him if he had paid for his drink.  I assume that she did this as he wasn't dressed the nicest and the manager gave off an over privleged arrogant vibe.  He started to laugh and said something to her. She then started telling him that he was stealing.  He told her that he did in fact pay and that she should ask one of her employees. She continued to berate him in front of the other customers until another employee approached and confirmed he did pay for a drink. The look on her face was priceless. I watched as he tried to de escalate and ignore her but she continued to verbally attack this guy.  She eventually slithered away.  I tried to catch up to the guy when he left but could not find him.  Coincidentally, another patron said to me, \"I come here all the time, if you thought that was bad, you need to see how she treats the employees.\" Shame on this business for hiring such a despicable manger and human being. I will not be returning and will tell this story to as many people as I know who value customer service.",

So I sat patiently and after a couple minutes an employee asks me again what app I used to order. I told her Yelp and she replied with an attitude that \"that's impossible we don't get orders through Yelp\". But as you can see from my screen shot you guys DEFINITELY take orders through there. So I pull up the app on my phone I walk her through to where it shows my order and she STILL insists that this restaurant has no association with Yelp and that she has no idea. She apologized for the wait but like she really didn't care about the problem. And the way you handle talking to customers is appalling. I cannot stand a restaurant that has no idea what's going on. From now on I and the rest of the office will be going for our daily lunch elsewhere.",

Chic salad was mediocre in quality and there was not enough dressing on my salad. Windows were dirty. Employees behind the counter and in kitchen were loud and obnoxious. It was a Saturday morning and not at all busy. Panera is 10x better!!",

Quite upset at myself for paying $27 for a lousy meal, that i could've cooked at home, with a much better outcome. Definitely don't plan to eat at any CBC again, simply because it's an overpriced shitty meal.",

She told me it'd probably be faster than that. I was still willing to wait rather than walk somewhere else. I really wanted a nice salad after a day at the convention center! I sat down, and not even one minute later, my name was called. Everything was included--a lovely salad, dressing in a sealed cup, a wrapped piece of bread, and a sealed utensil set. I carried it across the street to my hotel room, and oh, the salad was so good. Everything was fresh and the flavors melded in a great way. This salad was a seasonal offering, and a mighty fine one at that.",

I love the sandwiches made on pretzel bread with cheese, tomatoes, etc.   The mac and cheese is pretty tasty.  The salads are small but good.  Desserts are about average for this style of place.   The service?  Not so great.  Maybe three years ago, I do not recall it being so bad. The employees were fairly quick and friendly. Lately, it's general apathy.  Also, the hours are wrong. More than a few times on a weeknight, this restaurant has closed around 6pm, not the 8pm indicated.  This has happened on Monday and Wednesday nights, more than once.  Please change the hours to reflect this.   Not worth the money, time, or attitude.",

First thing, any \"To-go\" order should automatically have plasticware and napkins, in my opinion, and at the very least they should ask when you pick up your food if you need some. This restaurant did neither of those things.... how am I supposed to eat soup without a spoon?!   Secondly, my salad was not fresh. The salad was starting to turn colors.... I uploaded a photo. Also, our panini sand which was stone cold. Needless to say, I'll stick with my panera from now on... or a gas station, quick trip makes better and fresh food for half the price",

    "text": "I have to be honest, this is one of the worst places I've ever eaten at. The food was absolutely terrible and the place is just plain DIRTY.  Came here for brunch last weekend to celebrate my birthday. Since my girlfriends and I were going to a matinee of \"Girls Trip\" at the AMC next door, we figured it was a convenient place to get brunch beforehand.  I wish we'd gone somewhere else. Yikes.  We got there at noon and the floor was blatantly filthy and sticky. Our shoes made sticking noises as we walked across the floor. Yuck! Why is the floor this dirty at noon? I could understand it being dirty in one or two spots if a spill happened, but this is a fairly big establishment size wise, and I'm telling you, from the entrance to bathrooms to the back of this place, the floor was soiled and sticky ALL OVER.  Why I didn't take that as a clue and just LEAVE, I'll never be able to explain. Cue up the standard excuses- I was hungry and lazy after a weekend of birthday celebrating and just wanted to sit with my girls and grab a bite before our movie.  I ordered the Farmer's Scramble sans bacon- it was SUPPOSED to consist of: scrambled eggs with peppers, onions, tomatoes, cheddar, avocado, toast and a side of oven roasted potatoes.   Well when I got it, there were NO potatoes. Not ONE. There was NO CHEESE. Not a shred. And the avocado? Two uber thin slices of BROWN, wilted avocado. EWW and NOOO! I didn't send it back, I didn't pass go. I ate the DRY toast (they didn't even bring butter or jelly), drank my tea, and we bounced never to return again. EVER.",

    "text": "On an average day, in the average town of Averageville, Averagezona, Corner Bakery is your average cafe.   This is the type of spot you don't go out of your way for, but is perfect for lunch if you work in the plaza; don't even consider this place for dinner. In fact, corner is ONLY open for breakfast and lunch. This small, but important, fact has caught me on a number of occasions on weekends and evenings going to the movie theater just next door and thinking I would stop in for a bite. I've been burned more times than I care to remember by their early closing hour. I usually end up at something else nearby.  I've probably been 20-30 times and can attest that they get the order right about 4 out of 5 times. Sometimes they miss removing the mayo, sometimes it's the tomatoes I asked to leave off, sometimes it's a missed item altogether. They're always happy to bring the missed item, or fix it if I request, I usually just pull the tomatoes off if they come along, no big deal.   If you join their email and text list, they send out a promo at least once every week or two, which saves a few dollars here and there. The quality of the food is consistent and I find that I gravitate to the same few items when I go for lunch. The club sandwich panini, chicken pomodori, or the ham and Swiss. Their pastas are decent enough for a lunch, but nothing I would write home about and their salads are decent as well, although I've heard people complain about the avocado and have seen it come out a bit on the brown spectrum myself.  This is the dictionary description of an average restaurant. To be honest, I don't think they'd do too well if it weren't for the scarce food options in the plaza, most everything else is table service and is going to cost you a good $3-$6 more for your meal, with the exception of the national sub sandwich chain a few doors down.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

I called the day before the meeting to ensure everything was fine and they told me they weren't able to complete the order because they were closed for renovations. I told them at no time in the ordering process did it say that they were closed and the system STILL didn't say anything about the location being closed when I clicked the order in their online system. The person on the phone was condescending and basically let me know I was screwed because they weren't able to do anything about their screw up.

They seemed more keen to chat amongst themselves.   Food: we ordered the seasonal oatmeal and a yogurt parfait to go.

It was topped with walnuts and whipped cream.   Atmosphere: this restaurant offers a lot of seating area.   I'll probably be back once school is in session to try their lunch offerings.

They were transitioning from breakfast to lunch as we walked in, so I ditched my egg and toast mindset for a 'pick 2' option, which is similar to the pick 2 at panera. I was really impressed that you could choose anything from the menu as your pick 2, so I got the regular Mac and cheese and a chicken pomodori panini. While the Mac and cheese was a touch salty for me, I was in love with the panini. If I could eat that panini every day for the rest of my life, I would. I was underwhelmed by the mac, but the panini was so gold it didn't matter. I was starving when we arrived, and my carb heaven order came with a side of chips which I happily packed for the long plane ride. I thought it was nice we got a side when there was already so much food on the tray.  My boss got a hot coffee and a tuna salad sandwich. He loved the sandwich and I was impressed at the 4 different coffee options you could choose from.  We also took forever to order and the guy at the counter was really nice about it. The seats at the booths are a little torn up and in need of replacement, but other than that the decor was nice and not unlike any other regular coffee or sandwich shop. This was a great option near the hotel.",

There were lots of choices for: sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads, flatbreads, pastas and drinks. I ordered the 'Choose 2' option and ordered 1/2 roast beef and cheddar sandwich plus a cup of cheddar broccoli soup, plus a drink for $12.03.   The location is nice because there is a park-like area just outside. Plenty of seating inside for the Phoenix summers.   My lunch arrived in 8 mins and came with a bag of kettle chips and a dill spear.   The sandwich was outstanding, with a fresh sesame ciabatta type roll, lettuce, toms and balsamic mayo. The veggies were crisp and everything was fresh.   The soup was thick and hearty, as broccoli cheddar should be.   Highly recommended.",

Both of us got the chicken pomodori and it was SO good. Super flavorful and filling. This place gets super busy, but there is a ton of space so you won't have trouble finding a place to sit. They will bring your food to your table and also grab your plates when you are done. Great food and good service. We will most definitely be going back.",

    "text": "I've been going here for breakfast throughout the week while at a convention. The first day was great - food was delicious. But throughout the week the quality of food decreased as well as the timeliness of the food being made and brought out. Today I waited 45 minutes for a spinach and egg white panini and I opted to dine in because I figured I would have time to eat before getting over to the convention center in a half hour. After inquiring about my order I was told there was still four more orders ahead of mine. I think they pushed all 'to go' orders ahead of 'dine in' orders because many people who ordered to go people after me got their food. Many people had a similar experience to me. I think they were understaffed, which would certainly contribute to the disorganization. I am confused as to why they do not know how to deal with the 'rush' before a convention begins when they should be used to dealing with being that busy based on their close proximity to the Phoenix convention center. I ended up canceling my order after waiting 45 minutes. One of the waitresses was really sweet and had great customer service skills and dealt with everyone's frustrations very professionally.",

The desserts looked so decadent that I just couldn't resist.

And why do I need plastic utensils for my sandwich order?  Oh yeah, because I need to cut it in half myself.  Finally, don't plan to run in and grab a breakfast sandwich for the road- on average it takes 10 minutes by the time you order and get the food.  OK management, smooth out the flow!",

I had lunch here last Saturday and chose the salad trio of tuna salad, cavatappi pasta salad and the toasted sesame kale salad. After ordering a staff member let me know that they were out of kale and asked if it was okay to replace with kale with mixed greens, I was fine with this. After receiving my plate it looked pretty delicious, but after the first few bite of each salad it was only downhill from there. The pasta in the pasta salad was so overcooked to the point that when I would take a bite of it the mushiness would fall apart in my mouth. Instead of the toasted sesame salad, I received a mixed green salad which included a few croutons and tomatoes and an overly sweet balsamic vinaigrette which was just empty calories. Finally I tried the tuna salad which was the most edible thing on the plate. I'm not sure what they put in it but it was very watery and tasted sweet. I maybe had about four bites of the whole meal before giving up. In addition, a few other people I was with had complained that their chips were stale. I have no reason to return.",

The server came up with their food, delivered it, and then softly asked, \"um, how do you say 'thank you' in your language?\" They told him (it's 'xie xie' though my spelling is probably off), and he smiled, bowed, and said \"xie xie.\"  His manners, his approach, and his openness were like a warm hug. He could have been brisk and to the point, he could have just said \"thank you.\" He could even have been surly. He chose to take 20 seconds and reach out to a total stranger.   I'm not saying this makes CB the best place ever. But it sure gave me a smile at the start of a long day, and I am very grateful. In my ancestral language, \"tusen tak.\"",

I feel like because we had our backpacks on, we were treated less than the business people that were coming in. Like Hello?? Our money is just as worthy, so please show a little more attentiveness and care next time!! To other backpackers that is, because WE won't go back!!         Also the food was just okay it seems like they have more pastas and sandwiches than baked items, besides our turkey sandwiches lacked flavor or something. It could have been better overall, waste of time and money.",

As for the Corner Bakery, this location doesn't hop like the one on Bell Rd. So the staff is relaxed. Maybe a little too relaxed ... because the cashier didn't hear me say \"tortilla\" so I got chicken noodle soup served to me instead. The truffle hot chocolate tasted like ordinary hot cocoa.

Without gloves and touching my food bare handed albeit also using tongs they pushed chips on top and closed it. I had enough. I asked for manager and they asked do you want to talk to them? Haha yes please. Explained what happened she said they always use gloves. They didn't this time. Got a refund. No lunch. Should have been handled better in every way",

Today I was running errands on lunch and popped in here to take a sandwich back to the office.    Let me preface by saying that it had been months - nearly a year - since I'd visited here.  This was due to consistenly mediocre food and the final straw being bright blue peices of rubber chopped up in my salad.  I can't beleive that the staff didn't notice but I did - after I'd already gotten back to my office and did not have enough time to go back.  I had no lunch that day...    So today I thought - I'll pick up a sandwich to go.  It's been a while - I'm sure things are better.  The sandwich was an \"Uptown Turkey on Harvest Toast\".  It has turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Well the avocado was so insignificant, I'd actually forgotten it was an ingredient.  The lettuce wilted - not from the toast but from sitting around.  The bread too toasted and burnt in the middle.  What a disappointment.    I really do not reccomend this place at all.  It's not even worth going back to have my messed up meals 'replaced'.",

Space is nice and big with comfy decor.  Think Paradise Bakery or Wildflower, but with a slight upscale twist.  It gives you the feel of a small town bakery.  THE FOOD:  Every time, my hubby and I share a Pesto Cavatappi and Spinach Sweet Crisp Salad. And for me, I always have to have a Hibiscus Lemonade with Iced Tea.  They offer 2 sizes for both the salad and pasta, either cafe or entree size, latter being the bigger size.  It's perfect to share, and leaves you room for dessert, which I always say I will try, but never get to. I just fill up too much on the drink.  The Hibiscus Lemonade can be too sweet for me so, I like to water it down a bit with tea or ice or water. I would never skip on it though. My girls always go fro the Old Fashioned Lemonade, that is also good. Corner Bakery also serves what they call Mac & Three Cheese.  My girls always go for this, but I personally am not a big fan and prefer Paradise Bakery's Mac and Cheese.  THE SERVICE: Fair. The staff are helpful should you need help navigating through their menu, or anything else you may need.",
