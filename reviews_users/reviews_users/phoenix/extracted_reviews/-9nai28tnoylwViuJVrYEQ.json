Our waitress was not able to split the check two ways and extremely rude when asked. And to top it all off we had just finished our dinner and they asked us to leave because they had another reservation after us. Unbelievable !",

A gorgeous space, amazing live Flamenco or Latin music on the weekends, remarkable staff, a Chef Owner who loves interacting with his patrons and just makes a dining party fall in love with food -- and what glorious food!  After three visits and dozens of different tapas orders, I still am making discoveries.  Get five or more friends together, bring your appetites, and don't worry about the bill.  Heaven doesn't care about the cost.  A flawless place.",

We stayed to watch the Spanish guitarists and the Flamenco dancer, Yumi, who is AMAZING! She is so talented and sweet! And yes, Flamenco dancing is loud so don't hold that against the restaurant.   We had an amazing waiter named Vincent. Impeccable service; he gets 5 stars!! He did mention that he was newer to the restaurant, so (in regards to the previous comments about the poor service) it looks like they made some changes.",

    "text": "So we had a table for a party of 18 people, some of us had to drink water or share the pitcher of sangria because the waiter brought the drink menu but never came back to take the order from some of us. He appeared at the table 3 or 4 times to brinks one round of drinks, the food in two separate rounds ( people didn't get to eat together because food arrived at different times) and the 3rd time to take us the check that HAD to he all together and couldn't be broken out. Picture 18 people trying to figure out their portion of the $520 check and adding tax and of course gratuity of 18%! What a major disappointment and disaster!!! The food was not worth the cost (horrible value for what you pay) and the layout of the bar right in the middle doesn't let you see the singer and dancers while sitting down. The place was nice in a nice part of town and that's how they earned my one star review. Most of all the worst service I have experienced in my life. The server was a condescending jerk.",

    "text": "Decent if you're jonesing for tapas. (This is not a paella review. Yet.) I apologize in  advance if this comes off as one of those reviews that makes managers and PR firms cringe. I know you can't do authentic tapas in Southbridge/Waterfront and stay open. But I have to rate it honestly, or not at all.  I remember the original TPF on Camelback, I think where Sportsmans or Tarbell's is now. I recall it being exotic and delicious, with the right intimate atmosphere. My memory could be clouded by lack of experience at the time. But overall, *this* place is a little too big, clean and corporatey to match an authentic tapas experience like you'd get in Barcelona, or Basque Spain, or some of the real deal places like in NYC. I don't think you can be located where they are and pull that off. So it's dumbed down a bit for the market. I think if you're not on the search for a super authentic, intimate experience (small bar, communal tables, etc) it will fit the bill.  ATMOSPHERE Big, open, lively and trying a little too hard, IMHO. The uniforms look like Halloween costumes. It comes off a bit too kitschy. Staff all seemed pretty friendly, if a little harried. The live music is a nice touch, even though pretty low energy when we were there. I'm anxious to catch some Flamenco though.  SERVICE Our server, Timo, was the epitome of charm and enthusiasm. Big thumbs up for him. But timing was all over the place. First round of drinks took  f-o-r-e-v-e-r. We saw other tables clearly looking around for their servers. Not sure if the bar is the hold-up or what. Food took much longer than expected as well, since we didn't order paella or anything that was likely made to order. Once the food started coming, we got it all pretty quickly.  DRINKS Man. Do not order the mojitos. I admit I'm pretty picky about them. I love making them at home. I want them muddled fresh and I want to taste all the ingredients. They have a \"pitcher approach\". It's like they have mojitos on tap. I asked for a fresh mojito, not a whole pitcher. I just wanted to try their mojito, and then move on to an Albarino or some other wine. I got the pitcher anyway. And what came out was refreshing alright. Much like ice water is refreshing. Basically clear liquid with some rum aftertaste. No detectable lime. One sad little shred of mint in each pour. Very little sugar. The pitcher approach works well for sangria, obviously. But do not do this for mojitos. Doesn't do them justice. My wife's red wine choice (a pintoresco by the glass) was very good. A friend who tracked us down there after a Yelp check-in said the sangria was very good. So there you go.  FOOD I'll point out the stand-outs:  Boquerones Fresh white anchovies in light oil. Delicious. Smaller than I've had elsewhere. A little more body to the fillet is nice. But a great light dish.  Rabbit Stew This one gets you bang for the buck, if you're not averse to eating cute little bunny rabbits. Lots of tender delicious sweet meat in a light tomato broth with a nice acid too it. Bone-in meat ensured lots of flavor.  Shrimp a la Plancha (or whatever they called it) Head-on, shell-on shrimp. Messy to eat unless you crunch the whole shell. Not quite crispy enough to allow for that though. So mostly we peeled them. Quality white shrimp with real shrimp flavor. Not the rubber you so often get with grilled shrimp.  Oxtail Stew This should be so up my alley. Classic mirepoix dark stew flavor. Did I detect a little store-bought demi-glace starter? But it could have been braised a bit longer. Like a couple more hours. There was still too much un-rendered fat and connective stuff; not enough meat.  Basque Sausage Not memorable. If you've ever gotten the Spanish Chorizo from Schreiner's, or <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FLaTienda.com&s=22938137d8583eee12c6748119b6e69dc40ad30b92f79d5be6e6f5b3a5d77ba8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LaTienda.com</a>, you'll know what I wish it was like. When we get the Schreiner's, it never makes it through the car ride home.  Mix of Snails, Sausage and something else Didn't do it for us. No individual character to each of the proteins. Just a mash-up of savory chewy bits. Be a pretty good starter bread dip if you were hungry, but not a great dish.  Pan con Tomate (pan boli?) For me, this is a benchmark item. This would have been better if the bread had more chewiness and structure to it.  And of course they have all the stand-bys like Potatas Bravas, Fried Squid, etc. And Paella. Next time, I'm trying the Valenciana for sure. That alone could add a star if the flavors are there. But there better be smokiness, bone-in dark meat chicken and the rice better be crispy on the bottom of the pan.  So, just A-OK for now.  I could see an updated 4 star review once...  a) I've further explored the menu and know what all the gems are, and learn what to avoid, for my taste.   b) they fine-tune the service and hopefully work on the authenticity. the crowd that was there and the location don't give me much hope for tuning toward the more authentic. if anything, i fear it being dumbed down even more.",

With that said, I give them a 4 star because the food was great, and my review is focusing on food.  I enjoyed the gambas al Pil Pil, garlicky shrimp, yum. My friend's Paella Valenciana was excellent.  The only other paella I would prefer is the one in Madrid from La Barraca.  My husband had the Arroz Negre (black rice with squid ink). I also had the salmon, delicious. For desert I had the Crema Catalana, spanish creme brule, creamy custard with a great sugar crust.  We will try them again to see if the kitchen works better next time.",

I would consider coming back for tapas and drinks. Maybe.  My boyfriend and I went to Tapas Papas Fritas for AZ Restaurant Week. Our appetizers came out and were wonderful. And then we waited. And waited. And 30 minutes later, when we would have expected to receive our meals, we were told that they had run out of my entree and I needed to pick something else. After finishing our entrees, there was a significant wait for dessert, which was made even more frustrating by our waitress stopping by three times to let us know that it would \"be right out\". At that point, we just wanted to settle up and go home.  The front of the house is killing these chefs. Busboys were non-existent and plates were stacked on benches throughout the restaurant. I wish this place luck, but I doubt I'll be coming back.  Also, I totally agree with Derek J. about the Head of the House. Awkward city.",

    "text": "OK- so I did actually go back for my birthday. Just a small group this year, myself my wife and two close friends.  Everyone enjoyed themselves and everyone loved the food.  Including my friend Chris, who tends to be a picky eater. We went on Saturday so the evening started with a very good guitar player and that slowly grew into a band w/ two dancers.  I usually don't dig live bands while I'm eating too much, but these guys were great.  They even invited our table up for a little dancing lesson as our waitress had informed them that it was my birthday.  Being generally shy both me and Chris refused, but both of the gals went up and it was really fun.  We had the same waitress as last time, Laura, and she was VERY sweet and knowledgeable.  But, let's get to the important part, the food. Here's what we had-  Again I have to mention the awesome rolls and garlic aioli they bring out to start off.  So awesome and a hit all around.   My friends had never had aioli so they were VERY happy.  Caracoles aioli (glazed escargot in sherry vinegar aioli)- these were awesome.  Usually places try to completely mask the taste of the snails themselves with a strong garlic/butter type sauce or something similar.  This sauce was very light and that awesome earthy/woodsy flavor of the snails really came through.  My picky friend just kept coming back to these.  Usually he'll try something considered \"adventurous\" like snails but rarely has seconds.  My fiend ordered one of  the chicken dishes, but I did not try it.  It was the Pollo a la Cazadora (Garlic chicken casserole with potatoes and carrots).  The other three people at my table tried it and they all liked it.  My friend said it was only slightly spicy. Txistorra (basque sausage with sherry)- This was pretty straight forward.  A hit all around.  Again the picky eater came back to these over and over.  Solomillo de Cordo con Tocino (pork tenderloin with bacon, almonds and spices).  My wife and I liked this.  One of my friends said it was just \"OK\" and one of them hated it.    Someone had a beef dish.  If I remember correctly it was Espada de Solomillo (beef tenderloin with Sherry and sauteed onions) but don't quote me.  It was beef on skewers.  Everyone except me liked this.  In all fairness it's just that I hate cumin and it had a very strong cumin flavor.  The beef was tender and well seasoned, I just didn't like the seasoning.  Pincho Muruno (Moroccan style lamb brochette)- This was really good.  Again, it had cumin, but not enough to turn me off.  The lamb was really well cooked and  very tasty.  Everyone liked this dish.    We had the the Tortillas de Patatas (Spanish potato pie) again.   Just like the rolls with aioli I can't really express how great this really is.   Just eggy potato and onion paradise with aioli.  Under $5 and it was generally agreed to that it was the best thing we got.  You HAVE to order this, especially at the price.  I also got the Ensalada de atun con Tomate, a salad with tomatoes and bonito tuna.  Most people liked it.  I myself found the vinegar WAY too overpowering.  But it was nice to see bonito tuna on a menu, not so common.  We all shared a couple of pitchers of the Vino Verde Sangria- the white wine sangria.  Very nice.   So all that food and two of the large pitchers of sangria came to just over $100.  So awesome.  We also stayed a little to listen to the music so I wandered over to the bar for a 7 and 7.  I was served quickly and I got a VERY stiff 7 and 7 for $8 even.  At a bar in Old Town Scottsdale that's decent.  Can't wait to go back again.",

We went for tapas and found the food tasteless, the service bad and the wine overpriced. We disagree that this food was similar to what you get in Spain. It is disappointing  in relation to what you get even in other tapas restaurants we have been to in other US cities. We had a garbanzo and spinach dip which seemed like frozen spinach was mixed in with a few chickpeas thrown on and garnished with grated cheese! Tasteless and outrageously priced at $6. And the gambas a la plancha was equally unexciting as far as flavor goes. We would have ordered more food but decided to go somewhere else. There are other far better choices in this area. And the waiter disappeared for much of the time we were there.",

The food?  It was great.  Let's see if I can remember what we had:  Pimiento Piquillo con Centollo (crab stuffed pepper): 4/5.  Decent, but not as substantial and epic as this dish could have been.  Tortilla de Patatas (potato pie): Too dry, a bit disappointing.  Almondigas con Tomate (meatball): Eh. Pretty typical meatball.  Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic and white wine): Delicious.  We all agreed that it was the best shrimp any of us have had in awhile.  Caracoles aioli (glazed escargots): I hadn't had escargot before.  It was a good experience, although I had to most of them myself.  Probably won't order them again for risk of that happening again.  Chorizo: Meh.  Not bad, but nothing really to it.  Just sausage.  Rabo de Buey (oxtail): Amazing.  Best thing I've eaten in awhile, period.  Valenciana Paella: Delicious.  This put the meal over the top.  Because we didn't have drinks, the damage was less than $25 a pop.  And we were stuffed.  I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "On Friday October 3rd my family and I made a reservation for 7 pm, in honor of 2 family members that had just arrived from Chile. I personally have lived for years in Scottsdale, and we wanted to offer our guests a nice dinner, assuming it would be a memorable night, and so it was!! We saw the menu and the prices were reasonable. The waiter Eduardo; he recommended us the special which seemed perfect, the special included tapas and paella for the value of $ 45.00; which he mentioned is was ideal to share since we were a group. We decided to order 2 SPECIALS, for drinks sangria's, 1 coke, 2 glasses of wine and water. Eduardo never showed us in writing this so called SPECIAL; we were told did not appear in the menu. When he brought us the food we got TWO PAELLAS AND TAPAS, ( I have pictures) seem to us was exactly what we order, TWO SPECIALS. After we finish eating, we asked for the bill to be divided into 2, one of them was for $ 272.44 and the second for a total of $ 202.06; in total we were charged for 474.50. We believed there was a mistake and asked to speak to the waiter, he went to the kitchen and some man came out claiming to be the owner, started laughing sarcastically when we tried to explain the situation, embarrassing everyone at our table, saying we were drunk, and that we were lairs. This man was arrogant and offensive, accusing us of wanting to take advantage of not paying our bill. We decided to call the police. When he saw us dialing he called the police as well. When the police arrived my niece and I explained the situation and what we were being charged; our explanations were not heard and we were forced under pressure to pay such erroneous bill. My recommendation for tourists and residents is ORDER FROM THE MENU, STAY AWAY FORM THE SPECIALS!! PLEASE SEE WE HAVE NOT BEEN THE ONLY ONES, THERE ARE OTHER REVIEWS WITH THE SAME OR VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE RELATED TO THE SPECIALS!  After all we went through, some of us had to create accounts in YELP to be able to post our reviews and let other people know of our experience, well, the owner or whoever is Nanette G. has replied to some of them, even to ones that are not even us, or related to us, accusing them and us to be lying, that the reviews are False. Mentioning that we struggle to pay our bill, that we had planned since the beginning to skip our bill, that the restaurant called the police first, and so on... who cares who called first, we both called the police; and I answer directly to you Nanette G. of course we struggle to pay our bill, we were not planning on spending almost $500 dollars on food, we never order 7 SPECIALS. Since this is not the first time this restaurant has had this problem, I believe you Nanette G. should approach this issue in a professional way, and not making matters worse, blaming everyone else and not taking responsibility for your staff mistakes, Shame on you!",

The food is incredible. You can fill up on just tapas, but the entrees are great, too. The paella is delicious, and definitely something to split between 2 or 3 people. My favorite tapas are the patatas con aioli verde, and the crab stuffed pimiento peppers (just can't remember the exact Spanish name). You really cannot make a bad choice of food, but those are my favorite. Also, the red sangria is perfect with everything!",

We did request to space out 3 tapas at a time. We got 2 tapas at a time with only 3 servings per tape. So 6 out of 8 of us got a tapa. Tapas came out every 49 minutes. So 8 of us got 1 3/4 app in in 45 min. After 2 1/2 hours we each got 3 small pieces of appetizers.  Remember we asked for 3 apps spaced apart, we only got 2. After the 2nd app we asked to speak with the manager. 1 hour later we got the owner. He was nice at first then went a tad crazy on us. We paid the bill and left out the back door. Crazy experience. Sad for my friend having that be her memory of her 50th. I will NEVER go back.",

The stage is in an awkward location that doesn't allow most of the tables to actually see the stage.   It was nice to have live music and the performer.   I came several years ago and the performances and food were much much better.   The restaurant was almost empty inside.   The patio was pretty busy but the server was horrible.   Super un attentive, didn't help explain the menu.  We asked for recommendations and he basically pointed to an entire section n said nothing.   We asked about a drink menu or wine list and his response was we have a full bar.   Our tab was $200 and included automatic gratuity.  No wonder the server didn't care.   We loved the bus boy.   He came by 3x as often as our server did and was so much more helpful and attentive.",

The ambience is charming and romantic both inside and outside and the tables are spaced well enough to have a good conversation with your crowd and not worry about hearing others nearby.   One of the best sangrias I've had, and I try sangria almost every time a restaurant offers it. There are three versions, we chose the classic. Get a pitcher... it is very generous and totally worth it.  My friends and I started with the calamari in squid ink, and bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese. Both were exceptional! We also had the eggplant pastry which we agreed was worth skipping the next time.  Between the three tapas my two friends and I were almost full, but paella was already ordered so we tried that as well. We splurged on the lobster paella which I don't think was really worth it. The lobster was somewhat dry and hard to pull out. Considering the price was about $10 more than the others, next time I'll just try the mussels and clams one instead, or just stick with the variety of tapas.  We were there on a Saturday and got to enjoy the flemenco dancers and live music. It was beautiful. The stage presence of all performers was electric, you can really feel that they love their country and culture.    All in all, a great evening. I lived in Spain for two different summers. While this dinner could never duplicate the True Plaza Mayor experience, it is likely one of the best you can find in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "Pls forgive short-hand use; Review would be too long, otherwise.  SERVICE: Reserved through OpenTable wks ago.  Checked in w/ host & she told me about a great spot for us where friend & I could hear each other talk & where one of us would have a view of the stage, & told her I appreciated the gesture, but could we both see the show?  She sat me @ a table across the stage & two-steps from the bar.  A great spot, 'til I noticed servers & busboys entering & exiting behind me (front patio dining area).  Soon got used to the clatter, but what eventually annoyed us was that people would block the stage view on their way & back from the kitchen!  (Restrooms were next to kitchen, too.)  It would behoove managers/owners to move the stage to somewhere with less foot traffic.  Was here months ago w/ a group (Irene V. incl.) so knew service could be rude.  Hoped tonight would be better.  Denzel came to greet me & asked if I was going to wait for my friend, or would I like to order anything to drink?  Told him I was going to do the Restaurant Week menu ($44 pp excluding tax & gratuity) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapas-papa-frita-scottsdale#SPCe2DEC5YvywwjqA1h1jQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tapa...</a> & asked to confirm that it came w/ a beverage (glass of Spanish Moscatel), & he immediately became excitable, w/ hand gestures, leaned in & said that it was an after-dinner drink that would arrive w/ dessert.  This was when I noticed he had bad breath.  (If you're in an industry where you have to interact w/ guests in person, you better have ways to keep your breath fresh, yes?)    Friend arrived & soon after, Denzel appeared again.  Already had an idea what to order, but she didn't, so we asked if he could come back in a few.  He came back after 15 minutes & friend proceeded to choose an app & a dessert to be brought together & was looking for one more item she'd spotted online, & while she was searching, he seemed like he was getting impatient, so I said \"How about I place my order while she looks?\" (\"Good idea\" said friend), & Denzel didn't seem to like this for he made a \"whatever\" gesture w/ his hands.  Had previously confirmed w/ him that I could sub out allergenic appetizers (1st course came w/ five items- shrimp, mushroom, beef tenderloin, rosemary goat cheese-stuffed date wrapped in bacon, & crab-stuffed piquillo pepper) for something else, so I told him I'd go for a 2nd stuffed date & the potato wedges he suggested.  I then asked for the pork tenderloin entree & chocolate churros for dessert.  My friend couldn't find what she wanted, so ordered a second dessert- banana-apple bread pudding.  LIVE ENTERTAINMENT: Classical Spanish guitarist already playing onstage @ 6:50p.  Very petite female dancer was a joy to watch (dramatic arm posturings, spins, tap-dancing & rhythmic stomping), but when it came to her partner's time to dance, while entertaining & footwork impressive, he was @ least two & a half times heavier than her, which meant his footwork taps & stomps were many times louder than hers.  My ears hurt every time he did his solos.  Take note & bring your earplugs if you want to keep your hearing intact!  FOOD: Didn't think I ate well for $44 plus tax.  Initially was going to order coffee w/ dessert after persuading Denzel to serve the Moscatel first & coffee w/ dessert, but he didn't come back to take my coffee order ($4-$9) & indeed forgot to place my churros order.  Friend's bread pudding arrived long before my dessert did, & my dessert was given to me by head chef who said that w/ the advent of the dropped plates of food in front of our table, our server didn't know I wanted churros (??).  Of all the 4 different apps, I liked the stuffed pepper & dates best.  The spicy potato wedges were good & the beef skewer was the worst- bland and unappetizing texture.  Puff pastry-wrapped pork entree was delicious, the meat tender, & the rice so fluffy & soft- almost like risotto w/ the saffron & cuttlefish sauces.  Churros weren't good.  Bit dry, heavy w/ sugar, came w/ a caramel filling, & minimal chocolate.  SERVICE WAS AWFUL, so even good food can't make things right for me.  My friend enjoyed her 2 stuffed piquillos & Catalan creme brulee.  Tasty bread pudding arrived cold, w/ ice cream, so that was a disappointment, since we expected hot pudding.  We asked for boxes to take our desserts home, & Denzel arrived w/ what appeared to be a bowl & a lid & placed them in front of her.  When I tried to stop him from leaving so as to avoid  flagging him over for another bowl & lid, he made exaggerated motions of separating the bowls & lids & placing them in front of friend & me.  Friend had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing!  Why didn't he do this in the first place?  Ugh.  Stay away from here if you value service!",

Every person I have taken here (a dozen or so) raves about their fresh bread and aioli.   I dream of that aioli every night. :)",

We had stuffed dates, stuffed pimentos, lamb, beef, cheese, paella, shrimp and churros for dessert. The white sangria was really tasty too (the red was just meh) It was awesome to try all of the different items and will surely bring back friends in the future. The live music and dancing was really fun too.  I will say this wasn't really the right venue for an event like the one I went to since it was very loud, I couldn't really hear the speeches.  However, this place would be super fun to party with friends.  There is a parking garage right by the restaurant which I didn't know until I finally found street parking and walked, so definitely look for that.",

The oxtail dish is delicious 3. The flamenco dancer was very good and kind to the children at our table.  Negatives (Gordon Ramsey would have a field day): 1. Way over priced for the quality of food served 2. The tapas were obviously not fresh, prepared in large quantities and stored under heat lamps. Most dishes were dry (fishes), chewy (sausages), or cold and spongy (tortes). 3. A server belched behind my wife as he passed by. 4. The staff were inattentive, seldom removed our empty plates, or checked on us to see if we needed anything. 5. The sangria was average at best (red) and disgusting at worst (white). 6. The paella was very watery and overpriced for what was received.  Ultimately, this restaurant fails because of the gargantuan menu. They have what seems like 100 or more tapas selections, but they prepared only a very few well. TRIM THE MENU!!  The only reason I give Two stars is due to the kind dancer who invited our friends little girl to dance on stage for a song.  Our party of 8 will not return here again.",

They had live music on the patio and it was excellent.  I was very please with the whole experience and I am sure I will probably return when in that area again.  The only suggestion I would have is if you are sharing the Tapas make sure to ask for some extra utensils to cut them up and serve. We never asked but I am sure they would have brought them over if we had brought it up. The whole staff was great.",

My wife and I had a delicious meal of several appetizers, followed by paella.  Our tapas included:  a portabella mushroom stuffed with goat cheese, a potato pie, and two artichoke hearts dipped in eggand lightly fried.  We had fun debating which one was best....but, that was a wasted discussion once the (vegetarian) paella was brought to the table.  It was authentic and wonderful!  Clearly, we stuck with a vegetarian theme, but diners all around us were equally delighted by their meat dishes.  And here's the thing about this restaurant....we ate outside on a Saturday night in August - usually, not much fun in Scottsdale.   But, the powerful misting system kept us amazingly cool!  We felt like we'd gone on a vacation to escape the heat, but only traveled about 8 miles from our home.  A real treat for us desert dwellers.",

    "text": "I was recommended by my co-worker to try this place out since my girlfriend was visiting and we both enjoy Tapas.  When we got there on Saturday night there was live Flamenco dancing which was very cool!  Unfortunately the staff there was awkward and seemed a bit disorganized because there was no one in the front to greet us and when the hostess found a table for us outside she did not set the table she just kind of pointed to where to go and left.    The ambiance outside was very nice and peaceful and when we went to open the menu, I was a little overwhelmed by how extensive it was.  My girlfriend and I decided to stick with the prefix menu of 6 tapas that were \"their most popular.\"  The food tasted good, but unfortunately everything seemed to have been cold and/or sat out for a little bit.  I say that because nothing that we got, including the bread, seemed to taste very fresh or freshly prepared.  The bread was a little tough, but the garlic sauce to dip it was absolutely delicious (especially if you love garlic).  The sauteed shrimp w/ garlic came after and it was needless to say just basic shrimp.  The 3 tapas to follow were the Manchego, the Bacon-wrapped dates and crab stuffed bell peppers.  Everything tasted good, but like i said everything was cold.  Also be careful, there's a toothpick in the dates that my server failed to tell me so although I did bite into it luckily I wasn't punctured.  The Lamb was delicious as was the tenderloin adobo.  The Final dish was the paella which was good.  They did not skimp on any of the seafood which is always a plus.    Overall I did want to really like this place, but just due to the slightly overpriced items that unfortunately were not as delightful as I would have liked, it was definitely worth a shot.  Cheers",

My family and I walked in and immediately got a rude invite from the hostess. I asked for a table to accommodate a party of four and she rudely told me that there was no room left. Looking around I noticed that the whole inside of the restaurant was vacant and there was plenty of seating outside. I pointed out the empty seats and she responded that they were reserved already. Funny thing is that I showed up today at around 7 pm. I highly doubt that over half of the restaurant was reserved, it is clear that we where just not wanted. What a loss to them, I am scouting for a location for a corporate event in Scottsdale and was considering this restaurant as an option to bring our business to.",

The restaurant is loud and very difficult to have a conversation especially with the kids.  The Flamenco dancers were great as the kids loved to watch them.  So for an authentic experience it was a nice place for the kids.  The Tapas were hit or miss for me.  Some had great flavor like the crab dish, but the calamari was bland as were the meatballs.   I ordered the Shrimp Diablo Paella an it was fantastic!!!   I would go back and have another Paella dish, but I won't be running back anytime soon.   Nice place, but no WOW factor.",

My girlfriend and I couldn't decide from the long list of small plates, so we ordered the chef's special.  Worth every peso.  We started with small peppers stuffed with crab meat, cheese wedges, and my favorite -- dates stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon.  Next came sauteed shrimp.  This was followed by small slices of beef tenderloin in a delicious sauce, along with lamb chops.    After that was cleared away and my friend and I were talking, the server brought new, clean dishes.  Hmm, I wondered, what's this all about?  I had forgotten there was another course -- a dish of wonderful paella!  Oh, arghh, I wished I hadn't eaten that second roll.   We wound up with most of the paella to go, and the server wisely put it into two separate boxes.    My friend had the \"after dinner digestive drink\" (champagne) and I had the flan.  Which I shared.  Then had to control the urge to lick the bowl to get the last drops of the caramel sauce.    As we walked out, we knew we'd be back, and with a larger group of friends.",

If you haven't had tapas before, they're like appetizer/bite size portions meals. $6-10 each.   Located in Stetson plaza center in Old town Scottsdale near the back. Couple people in our group had a difficult time finding this place. Atmosphere was classy. Live music was good but loud.   I only had water but several people in our group weren't very impressed with their mixed drinks. The complimentary rolls and garlic dip were good enough for me to have 4.  I had asked the waiter to \"surprise\" me with the most popular dishes under the seafood and meat tapas section, but immediately asked which ones he'll pick for me.  Whoops. He picked: *Chuletilla de Cordero - lamb chops with spices. Comes in twos. Very flavorful and tender! *Pimiento Piquillo con Centollo - peppers stuffed with crab meat. Comes in twos. The sauce is good!  Overall experience, not that special or different than anything I've had in the past. Portion size is pretty small for the price.",

It's an expensive place, and having been to Spain several times, I had high hopes of treating my family to a really authentic Spanish meal. All I can say is, Spain has a lot better food to offer, and you are better off skipping this poor facsimile.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I was very torn on whether to give this restaurant a 3-star or 4-star review. Honestly, I would have given Tapas Papa Frita a 4-star review if I had never been to Spain and didn't have high expectations for paella. From the moment we walked in, the service was wonderful. Everyone from the seating hostess to our waiter was very attentive to our needs and wanting to make sure we had the best dining experience. Next, there were musicians outside playing all evening and they were great! The music really added to the ambiance.   We ordered a chef's special consisting of 6 selected tapas and the Paella Valenciana to share. This is where the downfall came for me. The tapas were good, but the paella needed improvement. Paella is a signature Spanish dish and if a restaurant really wants to sell me on its Spanish cuisine, the paella needs to be cooked and flavored correctly. When paella is cooked properly, a thick, crusty layer of rice (known as \"soccrat\") is formed at the bottom of the pan. This paella was almost soupy toward the bottom. Also, the paella missed the mark on the saffron flavoring and was instead rather salty. All that being said, the paella did have an abundant amount of shrimp, clams, and mussels!   Great service, atmosphere, entertainment, and tapas, but mediocre paella.",

Restaurant has pretty patio overlooking river. This is why we decided to try it out for our first night out dinning experience in Scottsdale.  I had plenty of tapas in my life, what can go wrong right? We ordered Championes Al Jerez, Patatas Bravas and Pan Boli. The food was awful. I'm sorry to say this but this was the worst food that we ever had. The menu describe Championes Al Jerez as braised mushrooms with garlic and sherry. The mushrooms were blend and dipped in heavy olive oil (or some sort of an oil), no sherry taste whatsoever. Patatas Bravas are reheated soggy potatoe wedges , spicy, however over salted. The worst was Pan Boli. We were not really sure what it was when we got it. I mean I read the description on the menu but it just didn't seem right. The tomato paste was the worst. It looked like very pale pink mush, again heavily over salted, served with a sour cabbage in the middle of the plate as a garnishing? After we left the place, we were trying to recall if we ever had such a poor tasting meal through our travels and honestly we came to conclusion we haven't. So, in summary, getting glass of wine on the patio, sure but eating there no thanks.",

I essentially paid $20 for rice.   Service was slow. And the kitchen didn't seem to know how to do multiple tickets for the same table and our meals came out disjointed. As did the desserts. I asked for iced tea and was given sweet tea. Not a huge deal, but I discovered that the server probably didn't even know because they only make so much iced tea for the evening and when the regular is out, they just give sweet tea to the customer.   Coffee was outstanding. Atmosphere was loud. It was really hard to hear other people at the table. That was even before music and the flamenco dancer (which was very entertaining).  It then took a long time to get the checks, longer to have them picked up. And one food runner knocked my chair every time he passed and didn't acknowledge he had done so.   The place was packed so other people may have had better experiences than I did.",

This place amazed us with the complex and anything but bland flavors of each of the 7 dishes we ordered. From the seafood soup, the lamb chops, stuffed dates, oxtail, and even the creme brulee, we couldn't decide which we loved more. They even started us off with a complimentary bread basket with a delicious garlic aioli. The ambiance on the patio was delightful with authentic and tasteful live Spanish music. Arturo, our waiter, was with great spirits, customer service, and when I asked which vegetable dish he recommended, he immediately said 'I got it', and surprised us with a delightful choice of leek and cheese pockets with a great sauce. Arturo was the cherry on top to our splendid experience at Tapas Papa Frita. Highly recommend this restaurant ! Location is also perfectly walkable to all of downtown shops.",

I didn't find a single item that I didn't like, and we did order quite a few of them. The Paella was great and served in the authentic Spanish way (had enough Paella in Spain to know this), and the tapas were filling enough for me to not even get to an entree' for the night. And then the birthday dance, making this evening one memorable one. Price is not the cheapest, but totally worth it for the experience you get. Totally recommended!",

We went during restaurant week with a pre-decided 3 course meal. The first two courses arrived reasonably on time, but the desert took forty minutes. For fried plantains. Around us, individuals who sat down after us were leaving. And someone ordered a steak after our desert, and it was out before. After my boyfriend talked to management, our deserts came out but we still did not receive the desert wine we should have. And no bill. He had to get up and find the server to request it.  We were there two hours and saw our server maybe 3 times. And the food? Not worth the hassle. Unfortunately, it was very bland. No redeeming factors. I would not recommend.",

Their paella is made with long grain rice, not Arroz Bomba de Calasparra or Arroz Bomba de Valencia or any other variant - but long grain rice!  Why advertise yourself as authentic?  Paella is all about the rice and cooking technique.",

She was nice at first and helped with our drink and food orders after that it went down hill. She never once handed us our food. Think the buss boys helped us more than she ever did. The buss boys gave us our drinks and food. Every time we would ask for our waitress she would show up 5-7 or maybe 10 mins later and ask us what else did we need. Our waitress never checked up on us every so often. We had to consistently ask for our waitress and thats when her light bulb went off and finally became more attentive to us. It was a horrible service experience that night, but everyone else around was getting excellent service from the other waitresses and waiters. we left her a total of 4 dollar tip on almost a 100 dollar bill, cause her service was not up to par. And the food, nothing on the menu had anything that had a even a little spice to it. Its a Spanish restaurant but none of the items on the menu had anything spicy.  Waitress name is Raquel",

    "text": "Recently check out this for my first time with a group of about 10+ for a friends birthday.  Overall the location decor and environment were great, unique in the area and right along the canal in oldtown.  Great Patio and live music made for a wonderful environment.  Food overall was fantastic and the prices where not extreme.  I am right on the cusp of 3 and 4 stars but as they were easily fixable small issues I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  My  complaints where service related, there was nothing major but there were several things that that are small but would have made my experience 5 stars if properly exicuted.    First off I have only been to a Tapas restaurant a few times and for those who don't know you get allot of small plates instead of 1 big meal.  Its fun when properly executed.   The first issue was apparent right away 10+ people lots of small plates, we had asked when reservation was made about separate checks they said no problem.  When brought up during ordering you would think that we asked for the waiters first born daughter.  Its the 21st century if you cant assign seat numbers and teach you staff how to set it up in your POS system there are issues.  Either way be consistent with what you say, anyway ill wrap back to this.  Everyone started ordering small plates and big plates (full meals).  Food started coming out and no one knew where it went because everyone ordered a bunch of stuff and when you look at the menu you will understand why no one remembered exactly what they ordered.  Already back at seat numbers, help you staff and your clients its easy go to a chili's they can teach you how to do it.  Next issue there was 1 server for the whole section of the patio, other tables where clearly upset and we as the big table still did not get service because they where spending so much time with the other 6 tables in there section.  You lost out on at least 2-3 rounds of drinks by not having a second server backing you up or helping in the section.  I am sure some other reviews around this time will reflect the small table perspective of this as they looked pissed.    Everything was going well have been there for over an hour at this point rounds of tapas coming out everyone at the table has eaten and we are getting ready to get the tab.  Except the 3 people who got meals, still did not have their food.  At this point I was very hungry having watched the whole table eat these great little plates people even ordered seconds that came out way before my meal.  If there is going to be a 45 min difference in delivery you should warn clients, clearly the kitchen is not set up to handle both.  Ill leave it at that, simple sentence and would not have been an issue.  Lastly we finally ate now it was actually time for the bill, well just like i said it was a nightmare.  Brought a long bill that took forever to break down manually, then once we did it took them 25 min to process it.  All and all it actually was not a great experience and rethinking it right now I am going to have to change it to 3 star because they said they could split on the phone then refused to leading to allot of the bad experience.  Although with a couple or with one person picking up the check this would not be an issue but i would avoid it if you have more then 1 person paying.  I will be going back though it was a great atmosphere and food, will update this when I do....",

I always read Yelp to see what's good to eat at places and some of the reviews were bad in terms of service for this place.  I experienced the best service.  The hostess was friendly and we were running late for our reservation.  Our table was towards the back but had a perfect view for the live music and flamenco dancer. I unlike some reviews found the music and volume of music to be great.  It was like having a gourmet dinner at a concert.   Our waiter Vincent was amazing!  He recommended the red sangria and the taste of Spain special for dinner.  The sangria was delicious and Vincent never let my cup stay empty.  The tour of Spain was really cool. My favorite small plate was the date wrapped in bacon. The paella was we ate which I think was the valencia or something.  It was very flavorful and I plan to go back and have it soon.  The atmosphere, service and food are worth the dining price. If you're looking to catch up and chat with someone the music could be distracting...I would go here to be entertained and have your taste buds amazed.",

    "text": "I think I have a new favorite restaurant in the Valley.  Our party of 5 started off with tapas.  I'll try to remember them all: manchego cheese with jamon, pan-fried bacala (cod), garlic sauteed shrimp, mussels in a spicy tomato sauce, and my two favorite: the lamb shanks and a special, which I was sad to learn isn't a mainstay: goat cheese-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon.  All were excellent.  The wrapped dates may be the single most unique thing I've ever eaten, and they were absolutely delicious.  The lamb, even though it \"looked\" overcooked, was fantastic.  Full of flavor, perfectly crusted, and very juicy.  For my entree I got the Valencian paella.  Absolutely delicious.  The Chistorra made the dish, as it added a perfect smoky flavor.    My fiancee got the chicken paella, which was very similar to mine, just lacking the shellfish.  The flavor was \"simpler,\" but just as good in a different way.  I will be back, and frequently.  If two people were to stick to a few tapas and then split an order of paella, you could get out of here for relatively cheap and still have a full meal.  Excellent, attentive service, and a great outdoor patio right on the canal.",

    "text": "ok....I will try to make it quick and understandable: my wife and I like the place, that was our first visit. ok greeting (not really \"professional\")....great table, good food (tapas and paella). Here is where I have a problem: we both went with the suggested \"Chef's special\" (not certain that is what they call it) where for $45 each we get a selection of several tapas (Chef's choice), each get a paella and at the end a shot of some Spanish liquor that my wife really enjoyed....back to the \"problem\": the pleasant waiter asked which paella we wanted...the \"regular\" one or the one with lobster? Not aware that there were 2 paellas offered and at the strong recommendation of the waiter, we opted for one of each...both were very well prepared but lacking saffron all together...too bad! When the check came I was expecting the following: 45 + 45 + 60 (wine) = $ 150- (plus tax and gratuity of course) but instead it read: 45 + 25 + 35 = $165........when confronted with what seemed like an error, the waiter went into explanations we could not comprehend and assured us that he saved us a few $$...how so? If the lobster paella (tiny lobster tail) had an extra charge, he should have told us at the beginning. And $15 additional for a tiny frozen lobster tail is not right either. This being said, we will return but we will be more inquisitive. ...I forgot to say: the selection of tapas brought to us was plentiful and well prepared.",

    "text": "After a day of drinking in Scottsdale, a group of my friends and I met here for dinner.  I had never had tapas before, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.  There are a LOT of options!  We arrived during happy hour, and the cheapest drink on the menu was a coke/red wine combo.  It sounded nasty, but I was so curious about it that I decided to order it anyway.  It was... not gross?  I'd never have thought to mix those two things together, but roll with it.  It's unique.  Our server was incredibly helpful in explaining all the dishes to us.  We ordered an array of tapas to share, and they were all quite good.  My favorite was definitely the Txipirones con Almendras, aka stuffed squid.  I used to think I was allergic to squid, but I decided to throw caution to the wind and try it anyway, and I'm glad I went for it.  Absolutely delicious, and squid ink is surprisingly tasty!  I can't recall everything we ordered (there were lots of plates going around!) but it was a good meal.  This is a fun restaurant to visit with a big-ish group of people so you can order tons of things and try them all.",

I had to have one with my Garlic egg drop soup.  It was reminiscent of French onion, but garlicky.  We shared the  Paella Arroz Negre (squid ink and seafood) which we were too full to finish.   We had zombie mouths while we were eating.  Brains!!!  Little cutie pie thought it was way cool!    Too bad we didn't have enough room for desserts, a good excuse to head back over...",

Beautiful lighting, check Miro artwork, check Beautiful bar area and classy place settings, checkity check.  Next up, the food and drink. I ordered the Paella de Pollo and a number of Tapas. Everything was delicious and came out hot and fresh from kitchen. No overwhelming spices and heat in these dishes--the flavors are more subtle and carefully prepared. Pre-dinner rolls were not the best, but I did not want to fill up on that anyway.  There was a decent wine selection and full bar for drinks.  Drinks have nice flavor but are not made strong, so if you are a booze hound, you've been warned.  The prices are medium-high, not outrageous for a restaurant in this area.  Finally the entertainment. This is just an added bonus that takes the restaurant to the next level.  You can enjoy Spanish guitar and Flamenco while dining? Yes. And it is fantastic.  Be aware, some people come just to enjoy the music, so there will be people hovering about the tables during the performance. It can get a bit crowded near stage (bordering on claustrophobic).  And while I enjoyed the atmosphere-some people might not. But if you love live music and the energy that comes with it, you wont be disappointed.  Definitely worth a visit or three. Muy bien!!",

    "text": "The first time we visited this restaurant (September 2013) we weren't incredibly impressed.  The hostess was pleasant but our waitress wasn't the friendliest or most helpful.  We were seated inside and the band was playing.  The band was so loud our table couldn't carry on a decent conversation without feeling like we were yelling at each other.   Someone in our party asked for a recommendation and had some questions regarding a menu item.  The waitress  gave a brief description of the item and basically suggested \"it's up to you\" (most of the time when this question is asked, the wait staff usually answers with a \"my favorite on the menu is....).    At this point we'd had it with the yelling so we asked if a table outside was available.  Luckily, there was, so we moved outside.  It was a little better outside (noise-wise) and the patio has a nice vibe with the lighting and the waterway.  The food was mediocre....nothing special or memorable.  Our second visit was in April 2014.  We thought we'd give this place another chance so we went in for an after dinner drink.  Again, the hostess was pleasant and we asked to be seated outside since we knew it would be loud inside and the band was already playing.  We were seated at the same table as before.  Our waiter, Jorge P., was unbelievably rude from the start.  My girlfriend asked if the restaurant had any cocktail specialties.  In a tone that sounded like he was being put out, he basically pointed to the menu and rattled off the names of common cocktails on the menu.  When my girlfriend ordered a vodka (Stoli) and grapefruit, he SNAPPED, \"This isn't a nightclub.....we don't carry Stoli !!\".  He said \"Grey Goose and grapefruit\" (of course the most expensive vodka) in a \"that's it--I'm ordering for you\" tone.   When my husband ordered 2 white wines, he answered in an annoyed voice, \"Why don't you make my life easier and just order the bottle?\".   He tried to up-sell each one of us.  The only reason they got 2 stars was because the hostess was decent to us both times, the food was mediocre and the outside patio is nice.  We won't return to this restaurant or recommend it.",

I ordered the Gambas al Pil-Pil Sauteed gulf shrimp, garlic, guindilla white wine - it was tasty, but nothing I haven't had before. The Pimiento Piquillo con Centollo - Crab stuffed peppers in a saffron sauce. It was small and nothing special. Sure, I ate it, but it was ok and presentation could be improved. The Pollo Rebozado Thin pound chicken breast with tomatoes and herbs was one of my favorites. Good portion, flavorful, it reminded me of a chicken piccata. The Solomillo Moruno*- Grill Tenderloin of beef with adobo was a disappointment. It was tough and lacked a great flavor. They should focus more on the flavor vs presentation. The Miarmones Open-face empanada with iberico apple bacon, goat cheese and basil was a large portion and it had a lot of great flavors. Similar to a pizza, a must have! Topped it with bacon wrapped dates, just ok, it had a lot of Rosemary cream stuffed in it. I enjoyed my evening, I just had better tapas in the valley, so I'm not quite sure I would return.",

Went on Mothers day, seated promptly and was given a great table outside on the patio. Great view and atmosphere. We ordered several tapas, all were delicious and good portions. Ordered the Paella Valenciana and was just the flavors I expected. But, was rather small. It was certainly enough for one, but if you are thinking of ordering a paella and sharing you may want to think about ordering more tapas. You will not be disappointed with your meal. Service was above excellent!!",

    "text": "I went with a group for Restaurant Week last Saturday during the Flamenco dancing. I made a reservation (group of 10) and I called and changed it a few times and they were very friendly and accommodating.  Most of us ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. They were really hesitant to give us a normal menu and it took several requests before they gave us one.   I chose the Mahi Mahi dish. The tapas that came out before the meal were amazing. There was this goat cheese stuffed date with bacon that might actually be one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. There was also a pepper stuffed with crab that was amazing. The Mahi Mahi, unfortunately, was overcooked. It had a great date salsa on top though and the accompanying risotto was quite tasty.   One of my friends had the Paella special and she let me try some. It was very, very good. Another friend had rabbit and it was dry and inedible.  I chose to go during the Flamenco dancing but I think that was a mistake. There was a singer and it was so incredibly loud we all had a headache by the end of the night and none of us could hear each other. It kind of put a damper on our evening. It would have been so much better if they had cranked the volume down a bit.  And last, but not least, the service. It took 3 hours to get through dinner. My friend with the overcooked rabbit didn't get his meal for almost 10 minutes after the rest of us got our food. Our server was visibly angry that I asked him to split the checks. One of my friends ordered a drink she never got.  So, three stars because some of it was amazing, some of it sucked. I'd like to try again on a weeknight when it's slow.,",

Not a compensated endorsement.  I love me some Flamenco and seek out places who have regular performances.  Watching it at TPF was difficult because sitting at the bar is really the only place to watch it on its small stage and you have to dodge the waitstaff as they come and go to serve the patrons on the patio.   The night we were there there was a bachelorettte party in a large table to the right of the stage and it was really tacky to listen to them yelling \"Shot....Shot...Shot\" as the performance was occurring.    I would have to go back to see how the food compares to what I enjoyed while in Spain.",

We were there for a birthday party, a large group and we had reservation.  But we had to wait for our table for 30 minutes at the bar until I went and complained to the management to get our table. The whole dinner was about 4 hrs, and 3 and a half was for waiting for our orders,  appetizers,  food, drinks, water, even the damn check.  The waiter was flamboyant but kinda rude, did not listen to our request.  He refused to split our bills even though we requested several times. And the long awaited food was complete disappointment.  EVERYTHING was extra salty. There's a live Spanish band with flamingo dancer inside the restaurant,  which was entertaining at the beginning but after 4 hrs, it got extremely loud to the point,  we can't even hear ourselves talk anymore.  Needless to say, we will not be back again.",

They have a wonderful selection of tapas and our favorites are the oxtail, rabbit, anything with chorizo, bacon-wrapped dates, escargot, and the mussels. They also have entrees and their paellas and especially the fideua are AMAZING. Their vegetable dishes are somewhat bland to me, but I've never had a problem with not ordering vegetables the next time around LOL. On the weekend they have live entertainment. The guitarists and the flamenco dancer are so talented and amazing to watch.",

The food here is pricy for tapas, but I'm not going to complain cause I thought overall it's pretty good. I didn't know what my friend ordered, but it was music to my palate while I savor the moment as I watched the Flamenco dancer sway, move, and stomp with a passion!  Must need strong thighs and calves I gather.  We ordered some finger potatoes with a creamy cilantro aioli, escargot in a red marinara, and some cherry tomatoes salad -- Yum Yum and Yum!  The service was pretty good overall, but both host looks like they were hit mans! No disrespect, but tone it down. Suits are great, but I would go with all black with black tie to give that 5 star service flare.  Ambience was great!  What can I say play some Flamenco music and yes you had me at hello! - Enjoy!",

If you are going on a night to see dancing make sure to make a reservation and state that you would like to have a view of the stage in order to get a good spot. The last time we went we were a little disappointed to have been stuck in a corner by the bathroom and didn't have the best view of the flamenco dancer and band but we could still hear the music.",

My problem is that we ordered a bottle of wine. The first bottle I ordered from the wine list they did not have in stock. So I went to a second choice the price of the wine was $75. I had not problem with the price. I buy and collect wine. Curiously I looked up the wine on Vivino. The retail price for the wine is $14.97.  The regular price for wine in a restaurant is double retail. The price of the wine in the restaurant is outrageous. The restaurant should be embarrassed for charging this price.

Unless you want to waste money and time pick from one of the many better options in old town. Not a good choice for business or personal entertainment. I love wine and the wine selection over priced.  TPF you can do better, work on that.",

He has a very positive attitude and was on top everything. Kudos to Domanic! We will come again because of him.",

    "text": "Now, although this can add up quickly, I believe the experience and location are worth the cost.  Visually set on the Scottsdale Waterfront walkway, both the ambiance and setting are awesome!   Most Tappas items are meant to share. Order three or four dishes and compare notes. I went after the Paella with chicken. The portion is large and it was quite enjoyable. There was enough on my entree to share with three people.   If you sit towards the front of the restaurant, you appear to be high above the drag and look down on the Scottsdale ongoing.  Outback aligns you at ground level with those walking the path, exercising and influx of curious tourists.  There are a ton of other venues around you to absorb \"coffee, ice cream, art, pizza etcetera.\" Scottsdale Fashion Square is a short 1/4 mile jaunt over the bridge. More shops there than you can take in and the best people watching in the area. That may actually be the best part! Funny stuff here!  Try out Tappas. Great Chef and Brazilian influence. Do it smart and split dishes. Mucho Comida Amigos!  #Irishcatv2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #Vino2 #Rebelfoodandwine",

    "text": "If you can't swing a trip to Spain and are looking for a chance to get away in a romantic yet lively restaurant unlike anywhere else in Scottsdale- you need to go to Tapas Papa Fritz. Actually... even if you can go to Spain or have no interest go for the food, wine and entertainment REGARDLESS. The restaurant is right on the canal waterfront which adds to the great date night vibe as outdoor seating has string lights and on some nights a band outside. I once went and they had a spanish guitar band that was so good and played such a range of romantic and fun songs I instantly thought of it being a perfect wedding band. The indoor has interesting decor that could be considered spanish or Tuscan and huge candles that have been lit off the remnants of a million other candles that came before it. The different colors of wax make a beautiful visual to take your attention while you check in with the hostess. The stage has flamenco mostly Saturday's i believe that seems truly authentic not hokey. The dancers are extremely serious and talented. The food is phenomenal overall I can't say I've had a bad dish. I usually go with the patatas bravas which are like potato wedges with a spicy tomato sauce and aioli. And then you can't go without having a Paella (I've been happy with chicken, vegetable and seafood. One downside is the service I've gone many times and if anything on a good day service is fair and on a bad day you see your waiter every 20 min which is frustrating. The menu is huge which i love as everyone can find a tapa they like but one downside is most tapas are pretty pricey and genuinely are one or two bites (True tapas). I recommend getting a tapa with a glass of wine then putting in your paella order - they'll also give you bread if you ask ! :) 5 stars for full experience",

    "text": "I have had a long-standing craving for authentic Spanish Tapas and Paella ever since my trip to Spain during my college years.  After researching online for any Spanish restaurants (most google searches will yield Mexican and Latin establishments even if you put \"Spanish\"), I finally found Tapas Papa Frita on the page of a yellow Yelper and decided to give it a shot. As soon as the fiancee and I stepped inside, it was almost like being transported to a hole in the wall place inside the Catalan countryside.  We were greeted with the loud music and dancing of a flamenco band in the center stage and the interior of the restaurant was built to replicate an old Spanish villa.  We were promptly seated and attended to despite it being a busy Saturday night.  For a busy old-town Scottsdale establishment on a weekend night, we received EXCELLENT service from both our servers the first and second times we visited.  Our server from the first visit, Vincent, was very friendly and helpful in helping us choose out which Tapas were the best for my fiancee who was a first-timer to authentic Spanish cuisine.  We ordered the chef's special Taste of Spain which was five Tapas orders and a Valencia Paella for two.  Every Tapa was delicious, but the one that stood out the best were the bacon-covered dates (which were not on the menu but provided to us by the chef).  The Paella was enormous, extremely flavorful, and True to the Paellas I had eaten back in the old Spanish Valencian villages.  We also ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria which Vincent was always promptly filling our glasses with, as he stated that he would not allow our glasses to stay empty.  The ambience of the restaurant was very friendly and warm, and even with the loud flamenco dancing and music, my fiancee and I were still able to enjoy an intimate and relaxed Saturday date night dinner.  Our second visit was what really sealed the deal for us with this establishment.  This time, we were attended to by Laura, who was being kept very busy by multiple tables throughout the evening.  As it was a busy Saturday night as well, not only did Laura take a little time to take our orders, however our food did not come out for at least 30-40 minutes after order.  As my fiancee and I knew how busy it got at this place, we did not mind the wait and ordered some drinks while taking in the flamenco performance.  It was during this time when Laura came over and offered a couple of free drinks on the house; apparently the table next to us was occupied by your typical high-maintenance and snobby Scottsdale family who were giving the poor girl a ton of grief because they were not being serviced hand-to-mouth and sending drinks back.  This same family also sent back multiple food plates and verbally abused Laura for the perceived poor preparation of food in the meantime.   We did not mind the wait and let Laura know to take her time as we both knew how difficult and obnoxiously annoying the typical Scottsdale natives were.  To our surprise, not only did Laura hook us up with putting all of our drinks on the house, but Joseph, who was the chef/owner of the place, came by our table to personally apologize for the wait for the food and to thank us for treating his server so kindly through the whole situation.  He then ordered us a couple of custom liquer drinks that looked like miniature beer mugs and toasted with us for a wonderful evening and to us as a couple.  The paella came out perfect despite the wait (we ordered the Arros Negre) and both Joseph and Laura informed us to ask for them during our next visit.  Overall, this place is one of the best restaurants my fiancee and I have eaten at in the Valley, and one of our designated spots for a romantic date night during free weekends.  It is too bad that this gem is located inside the dung nest of posers and house-poor entitled worthless shells of human beings who live on credit cards that is known as Scottsdale, however it is worth attempting to walk through the hordes of these walking scum to enjoy this piece of Espana inside Arizona.",

All the tables around us were complaining about not getting food or drinks. I think we lucked out. The food was ok. The paella was not good at all. It was salty and wet. Paella should be dry but this was more like wet rice.  I think they heat their paella up by putting it in a pan and then adding broth. Maybe that is the only way to keep up with the demand. Anyways it was not very good. Also the band playing made it impossible to sit inside. You could not hear the person next to you without screaming. That is why we chose outside. It does have a nice patio, but so do a lot of other restaurants nearby. That is why next time I will try somewhere else.",

And as much as you'd think tapas would be a fantastic choice for a meal, for one reason or another the whole concept often tends to get lost in translation with the food barely resembling its Spanish counterpart.  Having been disappointed by another Spanish restaurant in Scottsdale that I won't name here, I was cautious about Papa Frita as I got there for my birthday.    Luckily the place was a pleasant surprise!  The mood was great, great lighting and atmosphere.  Our party of 20+ was accommodated with no problems and set at a large table in the middle of the floor.  Flamenco dancing was in full swing.  We settled for a taster menu and got about half a dozen different tapas each leading up to the seafood paella.  While the bill was pretty pricey (may be 3x what it would have cost in Spain), it was pretty much in line or even a bit less than a typical Spanish restaurant.  Overall, good stuff.  Great for very large parties too, as it's difficult to find places like this in Scottsdale.",

The restaurant is beautiful and the patio is perfect with trees and little lights overhead.  Two of us went for an early dinner and had two-for-one wines and a half-priced appetizer of sherried mushrooms before splitting the Valencia paella at the server's suggestion (\"lots of people order an appetizer or two and then split a paella\").  Along with the complimentary hot bread and garlic aioli, it was plenty of food for a very reasonable price.  The paella was excellent.  If you read down the reviews, several people had sticker shock when they ordered the chef's special.  Maybe because of those issues, the chef's special was listed on a separate menu handed to us with the price clearly listed at $45 per person.  It includes a ton of food.  But, the paella we split was $20 and with happy hour pricing on the drinks and appetizer, our total bill before tip was $58.  Not bad.  We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "My husband and I went for AZ restaurant week and then decided we'd rather order tapas instead. We got five, and they were all very tasty. Small plates, yes, but five of them filled us up (or the two baskets of bread with the delectable, creamy dipping sauce did...probably that). Either way, we liked the shrimp and artichoke/chickpea dip tapas the most. They were a little pricey compared to portion size, but they were very delicious, so I'd recommend.  We loved the white sangria the most. Big, cold, perfect pitcher. The only thing not perfect? The price. $36 for a pitcher of sangria. Alas, it is Scottsdale, so you accept it.  Lastly, we went on a Saturday night. There was flamenco dancing with Spanish guitar. Entertaining and enjoyable. Part of me wishes we sat out on the patio, though, because it seemed more romantic and the weather was lovely.",

Seriously, $10 bottles in the store were priced $40 + here. Ridiculous and shameful. The server did not have much by way of recommendations. She said we should do the \"chef's specials\"- some pre fixe plan- which did not appeal to us at all. We ordered 2 rounds of tapas. Here's the rundown. Gambas al Pil Pil (spicy shrimp)- Decent but way too heavy on the paprika (and I LOVE paprika) and tasted burnt Gambas al Ajillo (garlic shrimp)- Better than the other shrimp dish. I really enjoyed the broth. I'd order this again. Berejenas Con Centollos ~ Layered crab and eggplant tart. This may have been my favorite dish of the night. It was delicious! Albondigas con Tomate ~ Spanish meatballs in a roasted tomato sauce. Pretty good. Way too much sauce though. I think there were 4 meatballs. Patatas Bravas ~ Spicy red potato wedges- I've had better. The sauce was meh and the potatoes had a great crisp exterior but were a bit too mushy in the center. Sopa de Ajo ~Roasted garlic soup, egg drop. This had great flavor but was really salty.  Boquerones ~ Fresh anchovies in a garlic escabeche- My friend loved these but I found them way too fishy. I was not a fan. I love the tapas experience but I would not return here. There are so many more delicious restaurants at your fingertips in Old Town.",

My other dish was a prawn, mango and avocado tapas, which was OK. I ordered a glass of Albarino, which is a white wine. What I received was a rose, which didn't taste anything like an Albarino.

The menu is huge, with plenty of options for vegetarians or for carnivores, but the tapas we ordered were hit and miss. None really blew me away. The most memorable part of the dinner for me was the garlic sauce that came with the bread - I could pour that on everything and not get bored! The sangrias (tried both red and white) were mediocre as was the flan, which was spongey and overlooked. Overall, food was just okay, but not worth what you pay. This might be a decent location for a larger company event, since the dining room is fairly large, but it's not a place I would come for a date or a smaller gathering of friends.",

The only complaint was that there were several very young children, we found out were with the band, running around everywhere and playing under and around surrounding empty tables. Not exactly what you would expect for this type of restaurant at 9pm when you're trying to enjoy a nice date night. Ok for Chucky Cheese, but not here at these prices, restaurant week or not.

The hostess was sweet and accommodating. I asked if they had the flamingo dancers still performing (which is a big reason why I came here ) so she sat us at a table with a view of the stage. The stage is placed in kind of an awkward corner. If a view of the stage is important to you then definitely put a request before hand. We were lucky since there was one table left with that view. The place was packed until about 9 so I would recommend making reservations too. The server recommend the sparkling sangria which was a hit! We tried a few tapas style dishes which tasted great! The meatballs were possibly my favorite! The flavor and softness was amazingness. The patatas bravas was also delicious and made with a great sauce.  We got a random dish that looked like a vegetarian pot pie. We eventually realized we didn't order this dish but we figured eh let's try something new. It was alright.  As for dessert, the creme brulee was wonderful!  For my friend's birthday they brought out the flan with a sparkler as the candle which was sweet and fun!   The food was overall good. The slow service was another thing. We ended up being late for a movie and at this point of the evening the restaurant wasn't busy.  Overall I would love to come back and def recommend this place. I will probably come when it's cooler to enjoy the patio along the canal. It's also pretty pricey so next visit would have to be for a special occasion too.",

There ended up being more people than we originally thought and they took great care of us.  The service was good, especially from the owner/manager. He made sure to ask us how everything was and shake our hands when we left which I found really refreshing. The server took a while to bring our check, but we were having such a good time talking it really didn't matter.  The atmosphere was great as well. They had a flamenco dancer there and the ladies and I really enjoyed oogling him over the course of the night. He also would teach you how to dance if you wanted to and dragged the two birthdays in our party up on stage to dance with them. He was definitely a highlight of the night.  The food was absolutely delicious. I had one of their specials for the day, which was basically a seafood chippino with a side of safron rice. If I could have, I would have licked the bowl clean the sauce was so good. The bread and dip they give you at the beginning of the meal are also very good. It's really easy to fill up on them. I tried the eggplant and crab tapas my friend got and they were so good. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food as well.  The only issue I had here was the bathroom. It wasn't stocked and could have been cleaner.  Besides that, the experience here was pretty wonderful and I'm already planning on dragging some of my friends and family back here.",

Even though the Paella wasn't really spanish( it just had the saffron rice and the seafood, it was obvious that the didn't use fish stock for the rice) I felt like I was in Mallorca again for about an hour and a half. The service was great and the atmosphere was nice,even though it was just a regular Tuesday night.  The prices are a little bit high,but what can you expect from a spanish restaurant in the middle of the desert? I am already thinking about going back during the weekend,since I've heard that they have live flamenco music going on.",

We ordered the Gazpacho, Monk Fish, Beef Tapas and Pappas Aioli. All of the tapas dishes were delicious! I even liked the fish which humored my friend since I usually hate all fish dishes. When I was in Spain I became a little addicted to Cafe Con Leche and it is good here. The Churos were a bit different, not authentic,  but tasty. When I asked if they served them with chocolate I was expecting the way they serve them in Spain. Did not happen but I still enjoyed them. In fact all the deserts here sound awesome. I will have to go back and try all of them. The first being the stuffed apple delight. This place is expensive though.",

We ordered quite a few small plates, all fantastic, and a very tasty bowl of bean soup. The bread and aioli that they brought out for the table was fresh, warm, and wonderful. The live music was the perfect compliment to a great dinner. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I loved the service here. Our waiter was superb. I love the fact that he gave us recommendations. Reasons why he would choose certain dishes and why he'd hold off on others (not because they're not good - more bc others had richer flavors). I like waiters who can make recs like that! So for sure 5*'s for that.   Price wise, it's $$ for the food that we got, but hey, this is AZ, and I guess you figure Spanish food is hard to come by.   Off the happy hour tapas menu (not sure if it's the same all the time). I liked the pork. It wasn't super tender, but the flavor was good, so still enjoyable. The sole was a hit! The stuffed mussels were ok. I wouldn't recommend getting them even if you are a mussel fan.   Other stuff we got:  The special of the day (this was a couple weeks ago)/\"octopus?\": butterflied shrimp stuffed with crab. The shrimp was good, but I'm just not a fan of that crab cake type of crab taste. I like the real, fresh chunks of crab taste. It was interesting that there was a slice of bacon wrapped around. I don't regret getting it and trying it. But wasn't a favorite.  Leek tart in pastry puff/Porrusalda: It was rich and flavorful, but not a favorite of mine. The hubs liked it though.   Berejenas/Layered Crab & Eggplant Tart: Not bad.   Pimiento Piquillo con Centollos/crab stuffed peppers in saffron sauce: Wasn't a big fan bc of the way the crab is prepared (see above comment)  Ok, now for our favorite dish! The Lenguado a la Gabardina! So good! Our waiter said that the owner eats this every day. We understand why. Delicious! but seeing how much we ordered for 2, I was pretty stuffed by the end!  I have a love/hate relationship with the menu. There's so much that it's annoying, yet so much that I would still like to try. We'll probably come back and try some other stuff.",

    "text": "First time going to this restaurant...it was a mom/daughter date.  After looking at the menu, this was the place she picked and we are both glad she did.  We ordered off of both the regular menu and the Happy Hour menu.  Service was nice, if OVER attentive....if there was such a thing.  We ordered Machego cheese, white asparagus, mushrooms, mussels, ahi tuna and cauliflower/zucchini pie--all from the tapas menu.  We couldn't decide which one we liked best.  They were all out extremely quickly, and everything was piping hot or nice and chilled.  The only complaints I had was that we didn't get enough bread to sop up all of the flavorful juices from our dishes....and they took away our plates so fast that we wouldn't have had the chance even if we had bread!  It was like they had a rule of 'no empty dishes' on the table....  When I asked one of the bussers what his favorite dish was he looked at the server for confirmation that he was allowed to answer my questions.  I don't know if he didn't speak English well, if he didn't have a script memorized or what, but it was an uncomfortable moment.    I can see how this place would get crazy loud, especially if they have a show.  I'm glad we went on a dead Wednesday night--and I do mean DEAD...we were one of three tables occupied and two bar stools occupied.  I hope they get more business soon, since it is a fabulous place.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now.  Once for happy hour where my girlfriend and I sat out on the patio and had wine along with an array of mouth watering tapas.  I remember the prices were so reasonable, we ended up ordering one of everything off the happy hour menu just to taste the tapas.  I think we were 95% happy with everything we tried. Last night I met a friend of mine there to watch flamenco dancing which they have on a stage on Thurs, Fri, and Sat. nights. I ordered a vodka and tonic and the bartender asked me as an afterthought if I wanted lime.  I said yes and he proceeded to bring me 3 in a glass cup.  But the limes looked old and dried up.  Small detail I know.  He shoulda thrown the lime slice in my drink then I would never have known! Then I asked for olives which he proceeded to bring to me wrapped up in a cocktail napkin . . . for such a nice place, I think he could have brought it to me in a glass! When the restaurant is nice, in a prime location, I expect the standards to be a little higher.  Tapas Papa Frita is not a dive bar! The other thing I was disappointed with was the stage was set off to the side by the bar area so if you were there to have dinner and to watch the show, you really can't unless you are sitting by the bar area.  In relation to the main dining area, I would say the stage is tucked away in the upper right corner and the performers are performing directly facing the bar. Nonetheless, I like Tapas Papa Frita and I would return again for the food, drinks, and atmosphere.",

    "text": "Last year we went to Spain. We ate a lot of tapas.   Granted I was pregnant so I couldn't enjoy the sangria, the jamon serrano, and the soft cheeses among other things...so I missed out.  Seeing this option in AZ, and looking at the menu, we had to try it. Especially given the above. I wanted to indulge!  Expectations were fairly low--it's in Scottsdale. Authentic tapas we were not planning to find, but the menu had promise. Props for having the offerings in Spanish and English.  Surprise. This place was AWESOME. Is it exactly like what we had in Spain? Heck no, the ingredients we have here in the US *are* going to be different. But it was darn close. The menu was crazily extensive, the red sangria was strong, and the staff was super friendly.   We ordered up a plethora of tapas and skipped the big plates, sad because they also looked promising but it was just the two of us. Split the banana chocolate bread pudding for dessert. Wished they served real Spanish hot chocolate. Had to laugh at some of the ways they served things--aka calamari came with 3 dipping sauces. In Madrid, they looked at you like you had 3 heads if you asked for sauces to dip. It's very American. But I love me some sauce.  Second surprise. The live Spanish guitar and flamenco show on the small stage. We thought it would be all cheese. Wrong. The guitarist was amazing and the flamenco dancers were spot on and had the same passion. You could almost close your eyes and imagine you were back in Madrid seeing it for reals. If it wasn't for the trio of English speaking cougars at the bar, that is.  The outfits the staff have to wear are ridiculously cheesy and it is in a strip mall--typical of 99% of the good restaurants in Scottsdale. Overlook those two things, and keep an open mind and you may be surprised.  Flat out loved it. Wish it was local.",

    "text": "We were here last Saturday for our 45th anniversary .  We had a wonderful table outside and were also able to see the flamingo dancer.  Great atmosphere. We started with a bottle of wine and then told the waiter we would like to start with the escargot  appetizer.  He said most people order three or four plates at a time because they don't know when the kitchen will send things out. We were concerned that everything  would come out at once, so he said he would wait a few minutes between ordering. About half an hour and half a bottle of wine later we had not been served any food. 10 minutes after asking our waiter about our order, we got the lamb plate and potato wedge. The potatoes were very good but the two lamb chops were paper thin and over cooked . There were two bites of meat on each chop and were served with  6 cherry tomatoes....$10.  After that we were served the paella we ordered. It was the squid ink seafood choice. It had 6 shrimp and some squid, but we never saw any crab. When our waiter came to check on our food he asked if we ever got the escargot and we said no...just cancel it. My husband ordered an after dinner drink and I looked at the dessert menu.  Ten minutes later the waiter brought our check. We asked about the drink that had been ordered. He went to check on it and returned saying the bar didn't have the ingredients for it. Needless to say, we spent $80,were still hungry and felt disappointed that we chose this restaurant for our special evening..",

Certain to please everyone & leave your party thankful & full of joy.

    "text": "We started the evening out trying to grab a table at Cowboy Ciao. Walked into a  1/2 empty restaurant and were told our party of 4 would have to wait an hour. We are still convinced it was my buddies Smedium shirt that got us black balled. After crossing the street and feeling bummed about the fashion faux pas we were called out to by Kevin (who will from here on be known as The Champion of the Universe). He said they had tables available and we replied with lead the way. He stationed us right in front of the stage where a band was setting up. Not always the best spot depending on the music, but this group(consisting of the whitest Spaniard I've ever heard, his son and a dude who looked like Munch from Law and Order SVU) brought it. The flamenco dancer definitely spiced the show up. Meanwhile the Champion made sure we had time to peruse the menu and offered helpful hints on how much we needed for the four us. We started with the New Basque tapa which was good, but grabbed the bronze medal on this particular evening. Another starter we scarfed down was beef tenderloin w/ adobo since we did have two Filipinas with us. During this time our beers were timely replaced and the ladies never ran out of water. Being Giants fans we have come to expect this type of excellence and the Champion didn't let us down. Our main course was the De Pollo Paella and we were not disappointed. The quantities were just enough that our friends smedium t-shirt didn't bust a seam. This place will definitely get a return visit on our next Spring Training adventure. Good food punctuated by great service.",

    "text": "I spent a week in Spain, which makes me an expert on Spanish cuisine.  I spent most of my time in Seville, which in no way limits my knowledge of the cuisine as Seville has great food.  Tapas Papa Frita oozes good food in sauces, creams, and oil.  I like to order plates with sausage.  The menu discloses the origin in Spain of each dish.  The vegetarian tapas include the standard fair with patatas bravas, tortilla de patatas, which was tortilla espanola in Spain, and miarmones.  The soups were okay and the gazpacho was nothing special.  The meat was great, and I couldn't stop eating those small plates.  The decor feels luxurious with a giant wooden door as the entrance and a giant wax candle that greets you at the entrance.  The ambiance indoors exudes a street cafe feel with mini trees, votives, a stone like floor, lantern candle holders, and an arched partition between the inner and outer dining areas.  The large window into the kitchen is also a nice touch.  Somehow, I feel like I can trust the food more even though I hardly pay attention to what is actually going on in the kitchen.  We came to see Yumi La Rosa dance and she had the other two males in my party and I perform a flamenco bull fighter dance on stage.  On the edge of Old Town, the restaurant is located next to the Scottsdale \"waterfront,\" a canal that cuts through the city.  When you're in the Phoenix area, I guess that's the best you can do for eating at the waterfront.  Great restaurant and a nice area of Scottsdale.",

The Atmosphere:  very comfortable - great on the patio at sunset!  Wait staff and owner have been very friendly and helpful in suggesting dishes to try.  The drinks:  love the white sangrias  The happy hour: the 2-4-1 deal is great, but ask for your double orders to be plated individually.  We felt that they didn't truly double the portion when plated on a single plate.  Also we were \"allowed\" to share a double drink order the first time we went there, but the second time, we were told that we each had to order the 2 for 1 sangrias.    Overall, we love this place - just have to watch out for those HH portions and \"rules\"!",

We were seated quickly but our server did not greet us for another ten minutes (we were wondering if we would get service at all). For the day and time we went, there were only a few people at the bar and another four-top in the place. The wine we ordered had been sitting wayyy too long, and the teas were so watered down I am sure we were actually drinking water. We ordered from the Tapas menu, a goat cheese filled portobello mushroom, garlic shrimp, and some beef skewers. We were are highly disappointed. I understand what tapas means (small), but boy oh boy was I shocked. I got one stuffed mushroom which was the size of my 4 year old nieces fist. The beef skewers were like rubber mats and to top everything off, the flavor was lacking! We ended our meal and left. Needless to say, I dont understand why there are so many positive reviews for this place, its clear there is some loyalty here- but we will not be returning. Sorry Tapas, Imma tap you out and go somewhere else!",

When we walked in the hostess was not at her post but there were two gentlemen behind the station, talking, conversing and completely ignoring us even though they could clearly see that we were needing to be seated...not a great first impression. We had walk over to the bar to ask if someone could seat us and a nice gentlemen in a Chef's coat sat us in a nice outdoor patio. Our waiter came over without menus and asked us if we wanted Sangrias but really had no idea what was in the drink. We had to ask for menus. We then asked for water with a plate of lemons and he returns holding two small sticks by a paper towel with two small slices of lemon. Our food was decent but really lacked much taste or flavor. The best dish and one we liked was the Garlic/Wine Gulf Shrimp. The Calamari was sub par and the three sauces that came with it again had no taste. The rolls were cold, dry and tasted like day old bread from the sale rack at Frys. This restaurant is truly overpriced for this level of food and service. Our waiter was nice but not trained well by anyone's standards.  The atmosphere was pleasant but we are not planning on returning any day soon.",

Food was very good as well, I have never been to Spain so I could not tell you how authentic it was but it seemed very different.  The warm bread they put out with the white cream sauce was to die for, I think we devoured 2 portions very quickly with my entire family.  We had to come here for my daughters Spanish class so she could get extra credit so I would have never known about this place since I live in the far NW valley.  There was live music and a woman dancing onstage \"wish I knew what kind\".  I would definitely go back.  We also got there late on a Saturday night and they were able to get us outside seating in 15 minutes with a party of 6 which was awesome.  There were some cigar smokers outside that kept getting smoke on us (I'm not one to tell someone they cant smoke near us) but it was annoying.  The service was so great and both our waiter and the manager came over and apologized for the smoke.  This is a very classy place and would like to go back for a date night without the kiddos next time.",

It over looks the canal by the trolley bridge in Scottsdale, which is so pretty at night. We walked up and thought, here we go, a typical \"stuffy\" Scottsdale restaurant, but not even close. One of the waiters walked right up to us, greeted us and let us pick our own table on the patio....which it was the perfect night for! We then are told how it's happy hour (everyday of the week 5-7pm) where all wines are 2-for-1 and all tapas are buy one, get the same for free! SCORE! He was very helpful since we weren't sure we wanted a full heavy meal, so the waiter recommended around 4-6 tapas plates and he would just bring them out 2 at a time. He also recommended a phenomenal wine. We had the meatballs, braised oxtail, aoli papas, croquetas, and lamb chops. Everything was amazing. My husband went in thinking he'd hate this kind of place since he wasn't eating \"a real meal\" but even he was thrilled with the entire experience!! Plus, they have flamenco dancers inside, which just adds to it all! They just opened 2 1/2 months ago, so I hope they keep up the great food and great service, because we'll be sure to get back! Very soon....",

Beautiful lights dry the ambience.  We got a few glasses of wine here--a little steep at $10 minimum a glass--but good quality and all Spain wines.   We decided since it's a tapas place, we would stick to just that! We got tortilla (egg and potato pie--Spanish classic) and escargot. They also brought rolls and a garlic aioli--aioli was delicious!  Tortilla was just as I remembered--a little small for the price, but I suppose it is just tapas...  Escargot was good! We got the one in a red sauce with Jamon.   Waiter was friendly and attentive.

I also tend to judge a Spanish restaurant based on their tapas and it missed the mark. The black ink paella was way too wet/saucy that it started to taste a little gross.. generally not like how paella is made. We won't be back.",

We had a variety of tapas , including the snails, oxtail, sardines, and others. They were all ok. The things that were awesome were- the leek tart , the plate with jamon, caper berries and manchego and the lamb. The oxtail needed another hour braising we couldn't get the meat off the bone with out taking it KFC style. As a marker, i'm a bitchy food snob, so take my rating with what you will.",

    "text": "This place brought back major nostalgia to the year I spent abroad studying in Spain.   Great ambience with lots of Spanish paintings and decor. They offer both white and red sangria, an abundance of wines, lots of delicious tapas, and a number of paellas. A fixed, daily, per person menu option also allows guests to sample various tapas, and includes a paella as well as a digestive (sweet alcoholic dessert drink) ($45/person).   One turn off, we saw our server go outside to smoke and when she came back inside she didn't wash her hands and continued to serve food and drinks. She wasn't the most friendly and attentive but she did an okay job.   Best part of the experience - definitely the live music and flamenco dancing! Ask for a table near the stage so you have a great view of the performances. Prepare to spend a few hours here immersed in music and dancing as it lasts most of the evening. It also takes quite a long time to prepare fresh paella so don't expect to get your food quickly.   Great place to come for a romantic evening with your honey or on a double date. This would also a fun spot to experience with a large group.",

    "text": "I hadn't been here in years and didn't recognize the name until I stepped up the stairs and realized the place. I tried to give it a second chance since it's been so long.  Fail.   First of all atmosphere. It's fun to hear live music and watch a dance. But not for an hour at a volume so loud that I have a headache and have lost my voice screaming at the guy in front of me in lieu of a normal conversation.   Second of all the food. If you can communicate with the waitstaff what you would like to order which you only get 2 min increments (see above) it is a poor mans imitation of Spanish food.   The food is tasteless. The shrimp pili pili was tasteless and not a hint of garlic. False advertising.   The diablo mussels should be called angelo mussels for all the punch they pack. As in none. The sauce was decent but was basically a tomato broth with nothing special.   Finally the grand slam the paella. Definitely not. Ot was also tasteless and we had to add the leftover mussel tomato sauce to make it taste of anything.    The service. We had a big party so that definitely contributed and I understand. However when we asked for more bread instead of saying ok and grabbing some he literally said you have some took one basket that was on the far left of the table and put it in front of us on the far right.   If you are going to automatically charge me 20% gratuity then I would expect a fresh bread roll instead of the leftovers from the other side of the table.  Please don't waste your time or money here.",

    "text": "My family and I came here to celebrate my grandmas 93rd birthday. We made reservations in advance and I specified that we wanted a table that was comfortable for her and would put us near the dancing .   Upon arrival we were seated immediately. Our waiter came and took our drink orders. We ordered a pitcher of sangria. Good sangria, nothing beyond this world .   To our dismay we soon realized that two 15 top parties came in about 15 minutes after us. Both loud bridal parties enabled us from even talking amongst each other . This was frustrating because as I had specified to the hostess weeks ago \" I am celebrating my grandmas 93rd birthday, please give us a table where we can see the music and she can be comfortable \" sitting next to two large parties which then block our view and hinder our ability to converse was not what I meant.    The main reason for 1 star, and I have never given 1 star review before, was due to the customer service . At first our waiter was helpful, but as soon as the two big parties arrived it's as if we had lost our waiter completely. Our orders came and went and he didn't show up to our table for 30 minutes . We had to ask for water 3 times before we were able to get a refill. Being in this restaurant industry myself, this is a HUGE-what not to do. I understand a server being busy, but if he is that double seated that he can't take care of his first table then there  is something really wrong with the overall management and customer care of this place.    It was my greatest intention to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I had read the mixed yelp reviews, but I wanted to believe in the good ones. Unfortunately, it was the biggest mistake coming here for her birthday. It didn't matter that the dancing and music was beautiful when we could hardly see. And what good does the food do if you aren't being taken care of by your waiter?   Lastly, the waiter took so long to return to our table that I had to go get him to ask him to come to our table. I was really looking forward to dessert at this place, but due to the extremely poor customer service we opted out. We did not even receive any happy birthday or congratulations for the fact that we were celebrating my grandmas birthday here, and I had made this an important point multiple times.    In conclusion, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. This place did not deserve to have my dear grandma dining with them on her birthday .",

I've had paella valenciana many times, and this was the worst rendition of all.  The only bright spot was the entertainment.   I definitely will not be going back...ever.",

Reservations were made but where they put us really bit!  We were at a long table right in front of the service area with - in my case - our backs against a rail that separated the two areas.  It was too close for me.   Although it wasn't terribly crowded the servers seemed to be in a constant state of rush rush rush.  We all ordered different tapas plates so that we could eat family style and that's when I realized this place wasn't that hot.  The lamb tapas I ordered was greasy, the ham was tasty but rather dry, the bread was the best thing other than the manchego cheese, tiny little albondigas, and the servings were really small tapas! And then the prices were just ridiculous!  An ice tea was $4.00, the cheese plate was $9.00, and the paella was $20.00 for some meh paella with little bits of meat, etc. in it.    The flamenco dancer was nice and took our little one up on stage to dance with her; she enjoyed the heck out of that.  But other than that I would not go back here.  There has got to be better tapas elsewhere.",

It would take much to convince me that service was even close to okay, because I sure didn't experience that tonight.  My first time was with a party of nine.  Be prepared to share any and all menus. This was difficult because people would forget what they ordered. This takes some time to get everyone satisfied in the groups.  After ordering be prepared to wait.  And wait.  Still waiting  Is that our food? No. Server... Uh no....  Waiting... Then a dish comes.  Then waiting some more.  It is incredibly unorganized with food delivery. One chick finally got her meal after one hour from everyone else. So we watched her eat because that is what friends do.  The bread and sauce is impeccable. I cannot say one bad thing about the food: top notch. The dancing is Great!!!! I loved the love music.  I would go back on a weekday in hopes of better service. Also, if I weren't starving.... If you have four hours to spare this is a great place! Otherwise, be prepared to watch every plate in hopes that it is yours.",

    "text": "This was our second restaurant choice for AZ Restaurant week. for 40 bucks/person, we were able to pick from numerous tasty looking options for an app, an entree, and a dessert. this price also included either a red or white sangria.   i assume the food was cooked to order since it took a while to get to our table, which i really appreciate. my stuffed pepper app was good, but for some reason, looked like it had been made about 30 minutes prior to me ordering it. for my dessert, i had the chocolate churro and it was decadently delicious. it came with 4 cinnamon and sugar coated churros and a small dipping cup of warm chocolate. an excellent, excellent dessert.   my entree was good. they offered seafood paella and just to be safe, i asked our server if there was pork in it. she said yes and then said they could make it without pork. i guess i should've have asked if there was other meat in it as well, but i assumed she would think no pork might also mean no beef or chicken. the dish arrives and along with a scrumptious helping of seafood, was full of beef and/or chicken. she gladly took it back and brought out a new plate of paella with only seafood. by this time, i had eaten so much of the free bread, i was only able to eat about 1/4 of the dish. but yes, it was good.  the cons...the 3 stars wasn't necessarily for the food, but for what felt like a disorganization. we were approached by 2 food runners with the wrong plates, and noticed the same problem with the tables on either side of us. when my wife's dish was served, the server just sort of plopped the plate down on my wife's arm. i didn't care for the sangria...it tasted a little too much like hunch punch i use to make in high school. our main server was fine, not mean, not friendly, just kind of there.   a cute little spot right on the canal in old town, but for the regular menu prices and lackluster service, i doubt we'll be back. btw, they did have a fabulous band and dancers later in the evening.",

It could just have been manchego bought from Safeway, dashed with olive oil. I liked the sangria but at $36 for a pitcher, I don't think it was worth it. I am giving it 2 stars because I had good company which distracted me from the mediocre food.",

Desserts are a must and we had the Chocolate con Currys and Flambe bananas with pistachio ice cream.",

For some reason, we never got the lamb, had to beg to get the Shrimp and the mushrooms and the crab were skipped. The paella was great and made up for the crappy service. We were full, and the embarrassed servers offered us free dessert as they knew they had \"issues\". We passed and they insisted on free \"Coffee drinks\" which we didn't pass up.  I'd go back, but I'd skip the Tapas and go straight to the Paella.   Fairly expensive for the value",

We decided to order paella for the table, and it was excellent.  Niceities included chef's tasting appetizers and a digestive.   We had Estrella Spanish beer and it was tasty.  This was a good place and different but I don't think we will visit it again with so many other choices in the area.  Somewhat difficult to find since it is up the hill and behind other restaurants facing the street.  Better signage could help newcomers.  Got the feeling this was a favorite neighborhood venue for an upper crust night out.",

After receiving our initial order of tapas, which all tasted very good, we sat for almost an hour waiting for the rest of our food to arrive.  Other tables around us were also asking for food that was taking way too long to arrive.  When the paella finally arrived, it had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp or in the oven for a very long time as the top of the rice was burned to a crisp.  That was the last straw and we asked for our bill to just include what we had actually received.  They did recover somewhat by discounting the bill, but it was still a wasted 2 hours for only a couple of appetizers.    Interestingly, we then went to Citizen Public House and had great drinks, food and service.  At least they helped redeem and otherwise frustrating evening.",

Scottsdale has an abundance of eateries with patio dining, but we headed downtown and landed at the Tapas Papa Frita. Wow, what a great experience. We had a great table facing the waterway and the service was solid.   We had the Chef's Selection Tapas Platter, which may rank up there with one of our best meals ever. We started with Sauteed gulf shrimp with roasted garlic, Crab stuffed peppers, with a saffron sauce, Grill Tenderloin of beef brochette with adobo glazed, Flame-broiled lamb chops with seven herbs, Marinated Manchego sheep cheese, and Stuffed rosemary cream Medjool dates wrapped in apple bacon  The  Entree was the ~ Valenciana Paella ~, A masterpiece of saffron rice with clams, mussels, shrimp, chicken, txistorra, peppers, onions & tomatoes. They say the Paella will be cooked in the same pan for the ultimate flavor and it was everything they promised, making for an over the top dinner.  At $45 per person, it was a bit pricey, however it was a wonderful dinner. The fact there was a full moon and a very lovely evening made for a great setting. Highly recommend Chef Joseph Gutierrez Tapas Papa Frita",

Our waiter was from Spain (as I learned); very heavy accent, so it was difficult for Mister to communicate with him. I had no problem...I can speak 'Man' all day long.  Although the place was three-fourths empty, it took a while to refill water and top off our wine. Staff wasn't really attentive...maybe because we were on the patio...out of sight, out of mind.

We heard our waiter complaining to the hostess that we were only 2 people for his 4 top table and he walked away from us. Took 15 mins to take our drink order.  Ordered 4 plates, first 2 came out and were barely warm but the pork tenderloin was good with a lovely sauce but no bread.... That came 15 mins later after we asked our waiter and another server for it,  other server said they were waiting for it to come out of the oven and she would bring it as soon as it was done. Our waiter then brought us cold stale bread and then 2 mins later the server brought us the so called 'fresh out of the oven' bread which was cold and stale but she did offer to heat it up for us! Our waiter didn't check on us to refresh drinks at all. He was also serving at the bar and we saw him carrying a trash can and then serving food to some other people! Yuk! He cleared our plates without asking if we had finished. Overall a bad experience we will not be back. Would have ordered more if the sevice was good but didn't want to spend another penny in this place, won't be back!",

    "text": "*3.5 rounded up*  My heart still tears up when I recall the marvel that was Tapino, and I keep on hoping that a tapas bar would appear that rivaled it one day.    But, July 22nd was not the day, and Tapas Papa Frita was not the much hoped-for rival.    Don't get me wrong, Tapas Papa Frita is a solid choice for tapas in the valley.  The menu, though for the most part unoriginal, contains a few little tidbits for the more adventurous eaters, such as oxtail (oxtail????).    My friend J and I started with a Sangria, and perhaps if we didn't order a *$22* pitcher of Sangria, I might have been more enthusiastic about the value of the place.  However, a mediocre, very fruity Sangria was ordered, and drunk in good time; there was enough in there for a little more than 2 glasses each.    From the tapas menu, we ordered the calamari rings, the spanish meatballs, and potato pie (in English :-), no need to embarass our gringo waiter with our gringo pronunciations.    The calamari rings were friend to a light gold, perfect, and it came with a trio of dipping sauces that consisted of a vegetable compost (mostly eggplant), a spicy marinara (though more spice than marinara), and an aioli, which was disappointing as far as aioli goes.  They were well worth the $6.  The meatball, however, was entirely unoriginal, though entirely soaked in a hearty marinara.  I probably wouldn't order that again.  The potato pie deserves a 4.5 star based on novelty alone!  I love potatoes, and I love pie.  Who knew? :-)  The only flaw, really, in their potato pie was the cream aioli served on top.  If you must have a bland item like potato, at least have an interesting dipping sauce, or something that complements it, instead of being simply a limp bystander.  We also ordered the Valenciana paella.  It was brought to the table still haughty in its pan.  On their menu, they list the the dish as a \"masterpiece\", and, sigh, it's good, just not masterpiece-worthy.  On the plus side, I probably would have given them 4 stars without the $22 Sangria.",

We had the Patatas Bravas - They were ok, maybe too much paprika for my liking, Queso Manchego - This cheese was delicious - Not too strong nor too bland,  Rabas *not gluten free* - one from our group doesn't like calamari & ate 3 and he mentioned they were really good (that says a lot), Salpicon de Mariscos - This was one of my favorites. The seafood was soooooo goood, perfectly marinated, Chorizo - Yummy!, Chuletilla de Cordero - This was juicy and delicious, Rabo de buey - I hate that I even tried this one, but it was delicious as well, and the famous Jamon Iberico - Very, very delicious. I was very content with 2 bites of this, but still had a 3rd.   I had a pitcher of the Salesianos Sangria. Absolutely perfect. Delicious, refreshing, .... made me tipsy. Loved this!  I ordered the Cortado coffee but received the Carajillo instead. Never had a downer in my upper before, but it was good coffee too. I also ordered the flan. I was dissapointed with it. Not much flavor. Pretty bland and stiff. My friend had the Manzana al Horno *not gluten free* but I still took a bite out of it and I must say that was one of the best pastries I have ever had. Lucky wheat-eaters.   You can imagine with a table of six and a lot of liquor the bill was quite expensive. But I must also say how absolutely delicious and satisfying it all was.   My partner and I could of ate another plate (but we had only had breakfast that day). The other four of our group were full.   Oh I almost forgot to mention the entertainment! The flamenco dancers were great to watch and the music was beautiful too. It was pretty loud but still enjoyable. Great place!",

    "text": "Once again, its interesting to see the varied opinions from folks about this place, and quite frankly, I had my doubts before trying it out prior to checking out the \"Capitol Steps\" comedy singers at the Scottsdale Center for the performing arts, but we don't get to old town that often, and wanted something a little different. So it was either this or Iruna, so for no real reason, we choose here.  We got there a little early after meandering old town for christmas gift ideas. Our server was prompt and very helpful in recommending various tapas dishes - Gambas al Pil-Pil (shrimp), Txistorra (basque sausage), Cerdo con jamon (Pork tenderloin) and the Solomillo Moruno (awesome steak, perhaps the most tender that I've had, after Mastro's). All were very tasty.  The only dish we had which we ventured on our own was the Alubia soup. It was a cool night, and a warm soup was well needed - and this hit the spot - very much recommended - black sausage, red beans, flavorful broth.  The other nice aspect from our server was the wine recommendation. I ordered a glass of Tempranillo, which I was quite happy with. Our server actually suggested one of the other labels which was wine spectator rated, and I was resistant - so, he comes by with a sample taste just to prove his point. Sure enough, he was right - so my next glass was his suggestion. Yep, the cost was a few bucks more, but my experience was much better, and it was my choice - his volunteering to grab a sample was the right move.  With no more Lola tapas, I'll still be nostalgic, but will be very happy coming back here - tasty food and great service.",

    "text": "We hit up Tapas Papa Frita for Restaurant Week. First, let me just say that Restaurant Week should represent a deal of some sort. Fortunately, it did here. $29 got you an entree, tapas, dessert, AND a glass of sangria or house wine, so roughly a $10-$12 discount. Perfect.  The tapas were pretty well executed. I enjoyed the Pimiento de Piquillo con Centollo: Crab-stuffed peppers in a saffron sauce. They were incredibly good. The Chorizo just wasn't for me; VERY smoky, but my dinnermates enjoyed it. The Espada de Solomillo left a bit to be desired; nothing was wrong with it, but it just felt uninspired. Finally, the Tortilla de Patatas (Spanish potato pie) was tasty and well-executed, and a decent portion at just $4.50. (The other tapas were closer to the $7-$9 territory, but this was AZ Restaurant week, so we weren't paying attention.)  Our server was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and there when we needed her. She even quietly placed the dessert spoon properly for my left-handed friend; something he noticed, but the rest of us wouldn't have ever caught, since she simply did it and brought no attention to it. Very good attention to detail with something like that.  Our entree were quite decent, but the paella valenciana was a bit lacking for me. It was a bit light on the seafood, and seemed almost hastily put together in a sense. It was tasty, but it wasn't absolutely incredible, and I think I prefer Pepin's, though I haven't tried it in some time.  They rounded things out with a fantastic creme brulee and an incredible apple dish called the Manzana al horno: Chocolate-stuffed apple with a Cider-Chantilly cream. It was absolutely fantastic, and had a bite of mint to it.   The sangria also got good reviews, though I stuck to my teetotaling ways.   Overall, a pleasant experience that left us just the right amount of full. I enjoyed the blend of tapas and entree, and though I wasn't blown away by the paella, I think I'll be back. It was a really enjoyable time, and the live music was great too. (The serving staff costumes were a bit on the nose, but it's part of the ambiance, I suppose.)",

    "text": "Disappointment on a tiny plate. I'm giving TPF 3 stars because the restaurant is exceptionally beautiful, they had live Spanish guitar and a flamenco dancer when I was there and the Sangria is fabulous. The food on the other hand , blah. From someone who cooks and considers eating a sport, I could totally taste that many of the ingredients had been bought pre made and frozen.  I'll give a little run down on what we had. Rolls- were frozen, par baked like you buy at the grocery store for Thanksgiving dinner but they did come with the most amazing garlic dip. They called it aioli ,it wasn't even close to an aioli, but delicious all the same.    Almondigas con Tomate - essentially frozen meat balls sitting in canned spaghetti sauce. Tortilla de Patatas - Potatoes used to make it - frozen   Pisto gratinado~ cauliflower in Iberico bechamel sauce covered in puff pastry - 2nd best dish we had.  The highlight of the meal was an open faced empanada with roasted garlic and goat cheese. I don't see it on the online menu to get the actual name but it was gooey, garlicy,goat cheesy and I could have eaten 3 of them.  Cava Sangria - tasty, tart and a great deal. The Sangria on its own is $8 a glass but by the pitcher it is only $36. We got 6 full glasses out of the pitcher so you can do the math on the value.  We had a few other things but they weren't worth mentioning. I'm also not going to go to detailed into the service because the place was packed and had several large parties of self entitled Scottsdaleites blocking the aisles and demanding much more attention than was necessary but I will say it was about 30 mins before we got our drinks and over an hour before we got our 1st dish. The rest came about 25 mins after that. The waiter was apologetic and we understood that it was more the kitchen and clientele than anything else. I wouldn't go back for the food but I would for the music and the Sangria.",

Last Saturday, my husband and I decided to revisit for an early dinner. We arrived around 6pm and did not have reservations. There was ONE party on the patio and a few parties inside. There were at least 20 or more open tables and nobody at the bar.  The hostess greeted us and asked if we had a reservation. When we told her \"no\", she ROLLED HER EYES and said that she was sorry that she had nothing available. I asked her about the 20-30 EMPTY tables and told her that we only wanted a quick bite, but she told me that they were full and we could sit at the bar, that there was plenty of room there. FULL? (I think she meant EMPTY). Actually there was plenty of room EVERYWHERE and nobody coming up to the doors. so I was surprised. I chose to leave the restaurant and NOT give them my service primarily due to the hostess 'rolling of the eyes' and condescending attitude. Every other restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale would happily seat us no matter how busy they were, so we chose to spend our money elsewhere. Actually we went to COWBOY CIAO, which was full, but they worked us in, seated us immediately in a quaint little table & gave us excellent, friendly service. WIth that, we ordered a whole bottle of wine, pigged out and enjoyed the awesome atmosphere!",

My friend and I had the tempranillo braised oxtail, quail in saffron sauce, and the papas fritas (as well as 2 sangrias). The places are tapas style, so somewhat small, but the flavors were so rich. (for the rarity of these dishes, the prices were agreeable). These 3 dishes were enough to fill us up. The sangria was ok. The patio is great and cozy with lights strung up in the trees. The interior is modern with an old world Spanish flair. There was great live music the night we were there... though it would have been nice to hear more Spanish/Flamenco music (a lot of it was Mexican/ Central American style). The services was great and our server was very knowledgeable.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week Review:  We didn't even know restaurant week was going on but our server filled us in on the options.  We could pick one tapas, one entree, one dessert and a glass of wine/sangria for $29.  The entire menu was fair game.    For the tapas we got a pepper stuffed with crab.  It had a nice cream sauce lightly drizzled on it and the whole thing went together well.  The other one was a lamb skewer and it was nicely tender and quite good.  For the entree I got the Valenciana paella.  It had a nice array of seafood and spanish sausage.  I didn't realize how vibrantly yellow it was until I saw it at home.  This easily serves 2 people.  The gf got Meriscada which was clams/shrimp/scallops in a light wine broth.  Hers was very good and more suited for 1 person.    For dessert we got the Creme Brulee.  It was much wider and the dish was shallower then I am used to seeing.  It didn't have a very thick hard crust like you traditionally see on this dessert.  Either way it was very good.  For my dessert I got the Escoces which was Scotch, warm coffee and vanilla ice cream.  This was phenomenal.  They should serve this by the pitcher.    We also shared a bottle of wine (on top of the included glass per person).  The atmosphere was to take your time, enjoy your meal, and in between dishes listen to the live music and watch the dancing.  We enjoyed the entire experience.",

We ordered the Paella de Pollo and the seafood paella as well. Both were delicious; I would have preferred a crispness on the top though but otherwise it was creamy and flavorful. I was really looking forward to an empanada and am used to the fried traditional type, so I was surprised to find this one was open faced and tasted more like a pizza than anything else. Ambiance: great! Service: spunky and attentive. Overall: enjoyable experience and would recommend it. Keep that sangria coming!",

The ambiance of the place is great.  They must have spent tons of cash making this place look like an establishment right out of Spain.  The waiters all were dressed in all white with red sash thingys and red hats.  They looked like Spanish bull fighters to me.  Anyway, the decor is very interesting to say the least.  I had initially thought the place had just opened because some things were a complete clusterfuc like the staff was still working out opening day problems.  From getting menus, to getting bread and beverages it was a bit rough.  However, the entire staff was very friendly and the food did come out rather quickly.  In total we tried about 7 tapas.  They have tons to choose from and they looked rather authentic to my gringo eyes.  Most of the stuff I've never heard of but they pretty much all looked great.  Most are around $7 and are probably enough for a few people to sample.  Almost everything I tried was very good and the stuff that wasn't was because I had no idea what I was ordering and was trying to be adventurous.  All-in-all it was a fun experience and a perfect thing to do when having dinner with friends.  I regret not getting the sangria after reading the reviews on here but there is always next time.",

We showed up and more than half the restaurant was empty. The decor was great, smell and lighting were also wonderful. The greeter however... That's a different story. We initially came in, stood at the front and weren't spoken to for nearly 10 minutes (again, more than half the restaurant was empty) a very nice young lady (not the greeter) came up and asked us if we had reservations, we did not. But there wasn't anyone else waiting. Greeter came back, didn't ask her, or us if we had reservations, walked to 3 consecutive parties of 2 behind us and say them. The pretentiousness was palpable and needless to say, went around the corner to barrio queen and had amazing Mexican food. It would've been one thing if I actually needed a reservation for a very busy night, but this was not the case.",

    "text": "Well nothing takes you back to Spain like getting on an aeroplane and flying there when the finances are right. But here in Phoenix, if you can settle for watered down sangria for $8 a glass, no bullfight, and no cigarette smoke then dining at Tapas Papa Frita is recommended. On weekends you can enjoy entertainment with dinner.  The menu is large and heavy and of a reddish background color, so it was a bit annoying to read through. But of course being from the Yelp community I pre-read it online and already had an idea of what I would get. Go figure I was asking everybody else if they were ready to order yet.  Other reviewers have complained about the lack of service. That wasn't my experience. In fact I feel like we were over served. I had to give our waitress the evil eye for popping over every two seconds while we perused the menu. And at meals end she insisted on taking our leftovers to wrap them herself instead of bringing containers to the table.  There were several selections of vegetarian tapas. Few were vegan, some prepared with cheese or type of crema, one had ham (which I'm unsure why it would be listed in the vegetable section).   Having tapas is kind of like building your own tasting menu, and we didn't hold back. Here are the uniquely tasty morsels we tried.   1. Pastel a la Porrusalda: Leek tart in a pastry - 6.50 Liked it, but the dough was a bit chewy  2. Champinones al Jerez: Braised mushrooms with garlic and sherry - 6.50 Liked it, but not too flavorful  3. Pimientos a la Riojana: roasted peppers with olive oil - 7.50 Liked.  4. Patatas Bravas: Spicy red potato wedges - 4.95  Liked them, but they had crema on top and were not spicy at all.  5. Tortilla de Patatas: Spanish potato pie - 4.50 Liked, but it was dry.  6. Escalivalda: Peppers, onions, eggplant, tomatoes, garlic over bread - 7.00  The veggies were good, but had a tangy taste. Did not like the bread, it was hard and not garlicky.  7. Cabrales con Menbrillo: Cabrales cheese with quince - 9.00 So-so  8. Setas con Queso De Cabra: Stuffed portabello with goat cheese - 9.00 Recommended by the waitress. Liked it, but it was too small.  I expected a burger sized mushroom, but it was about a third of what I expected.  9. Pollo al Ajillo: roasted chicken thigh in lemon garlic - 7.00  Having gone through the basket of white bread rolls and aioli and all these tapas, we were getting full. But entrees were coming.   1. Pollo con Jamon: Ham and cheese wrapped chicken breast with capers, and guindilla sauce - 16.00  2. Paella de Vegetales: Seasonal garden vegetables with saffron rice - 16.95   Although the paella was tasty I would not order it again. As a rice dish with cooked veggies the whole thing just had a mushy consistency to me. One spoonful was more than enough.  And now for the sweetest ending. No spanish dinner is complete without some churros. But share one dessert? Not at my table! So we also ordered the Pastel de Pan: banana and apple bread pudding with ice cream - 6.00   There's no point in saying another word about the bread pudding. If you like bread pudding then try it.   Cut to the churros. Oh dessert heaven...the churros! Churrrrrrrrros. I felt like dancing around the restaurant stomping my heels like a flamenco dancer and instead of clacking castanets, I would have churros on my fingers.   Churros con Chocolate - 7.00 Served warm, stuffed with hazelnut/caramel filling (??) and with a side of chocolate.  Unfortunately they were coated in a lot of unnecessary sugar, but delicious just the same.",

There are a ton of reviews, so I'm going to make it short and sweet: - food not on the HH menu is expensive and, for what I've tasted (which was actually quite a lot of dishes), there were only a few that deserved that pricing (one I recall was the lamb chops)... and if I don't remember the food I had, it's cuz I didn't find it that memorable. - it is super trendy and thus crowded and you *need* a reservation  This is NOT how I enjoyed having tapas in Spain... things were casual, affordable, simple but tasty, not pompous nor snobbish.  That is the kind of tapas place I would like to go to (and was expecting my first time here).  Short story: not really my kind of place... food wasn't memorable enough (nor was the ambiance enjoyable enough) for my taste.. wasn't worth the money we blew eating here... sorry, bro....",

My boyfriend was very happy with his dishes so it was money well spent. Our server was very informational and super helpful and took great care of us. Small plates are the way to go if you're looking to share and get a diverse amount of dishes.  Live music.. pretty interior and exterior views.",

Overall, I had a great experience. Our service was friendly and available. The food was delicious. Our table split two appetizers: crab and squid. I ordered the black rice and squid paella which I HIGHLY recommend. For dessert, I had a traditional flan -- it was a perfect way to complete the evening.

    "text": "This is probably the best location for a restaurant in Scottsdale. On one side, there's the waterfront, and the other overlooks a lovely little park with its own fountain.  Inside, it's just as attractive. Tables for two are cozy but not overly small and the restaurant accommodates large groups as well.  We went on a Saturday night and loved the band and dancer. They alone were the best part of the meal, closely followed by attentive wait staff.  As for the food, I'm a bit puzzled. I don't have another tapas experience to compare this to but I like the concept. It's sort of like dim sum minus the little carts going around that let you see the offerings. Or closer to home, the kind of tasting experience you get at food festivals like the one in Scottsdale. Except, of course, you can't see what you're ordering.  We tried a cheese plate--Manchega, which was nice--two seafood dishes, and Spanish meatballs. One of the seafood dishes sounded great--crabmeat-stuffed peppers--and it was very pretty but frankly, the crabmeat was underwhelming. Not bad, just nothing to get excited over.  The clams were in a tasty broth and the meatballs came in an tangy sauce. But honestly, the only thing that really wowed us was the sauce served with the bread, a kind of tzatziki.  I hope the veal and shrimp are the menu standouts but we'd made these at home the night before so we didn't try them. Maybe we should have.  Other Yelpers mentioned watered-down sangria. Mine was definitely was. But then, I've only had sangria at other people's homes. Maybe my friends make it too strong? Maybe Spanish cuisine is meant to be subtle? My overall impression from Tapas Papa Frita is underwhelming.  I can't say enough good things about the experience there, though. It was definitely a fun night. If I go back, I'd like to get there early enough to sit at the bar for a direct view of the dancer, who was wonderful!",

While the tapas, serving as somewhat of an appetizer was quite appealing, I was mostly looking forward to the main entree which was salmon with apple bacon and a spicy mango agave coulis with saffron rice. The presentation seemed to promise a burst of flavor, but what I received was lackluster--not only was the saffron rice gummy and mushy and overcooked (and kind of an insult to such a high quality ingredient!), my salmon was overcooked to the point of having no flavor, it was tough and chewy to eat. The mangos, while offering freshness, I didn't get any taste of spices whatsoever. The dish was not \"spicy\" as the description said. There was no depth or various note of any kind but rather bland and unappealing. I didn't taste the agave, which is thought of being sweet like honey. There was no note in this dish and I was sorely disappointed and was expecting a lot more especially for paying $44 which seemed a bit much for what I received. The dessert was also a bit of a miss. You can't go wrong with churros. The churros, by themselves, were delicious but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted like a bar of unsweetened chocolate. I've had dark chocolate before, but this was not smooth but rather very bitter and unpleasant so I avoided dipping the churros in after that. The only real thing I liked about my evening was the goat cheese bacon-wrapped date.",

    "text": "We picked Tapas Papa Frita from the Restaurant Week website for our anniversary dinner on a Saturday. I was hoping for a romantic spot on the patio since it was nice outside and we'd beat the crowd with our 5:30pm reservation. Inside the restaurant was pretty bare so unfortunately we were given an awkward table in the back, facing the bar and near the kitchen...probably to give the inside servers something to do...even though I'd put \"Anniversary Dinner :)\" on our OpenTable reservation/note to the restaurant. I wouldn't have minded this so much since we were isolated from everyone else, but another couple was seated directly behind us, about 3 feet away so it was just plain awkward.   Our server Vincent was actually pretty amazing. My water was never empty and he even went out of his way to ask the chef if we could order an item from the Restaurant Week menu (since we'd strayed onto the regular menu for the paella). We ordered two items from the tapas menu - crab stuffed peppers and the patatas w/ aioli, plus the bacon wrapped dates (RW menu item), and all three were awesome. I ordered the steak + bleu cheese and my SO ordered the diablo paella. The steak was cooked perfectly but the paella was lacking some serious spice considering the title, albeit delicious and well seasoned. I also ordered the sangria, which I thought was great (and even ate the fruit). Overall we left the restaurant stuffed and pleased with our anniversary date location decision.   And now my reasoning for the poor rating. Several hours after leaving TPF I started to get a stomach ache that, at first, felt like my stomach just wasn't agreeing with all of that food I ate, but then turned into something sinister. I'll spare you the gory details but will say that this was definitely food poisoning. Fever, nausea, the whole nine yards. I'm not sure what exactly it was - my mom blames the sangria fruit - but needless to say I don't plan on eating steak, bleu cheese, or any of the items we ordered that night anytime soon.",

We sat with dirty dishes for 45 minutes before we cleared our own plates from the table and had to flag down the waiter anytime we needed anything otherwise.

    "text": "Tapas Papa Frita was just very average. The service was fine. Nothing really to complain about, but nothing was outstanding. The food is just okay. Their menu is way too large and I think that prevents them from being really great. I had the oxtail, stuffed peppers and I also got the paella despite all the complaints here and I have to agree with others I've read. It was oddly watery and not crispy on the bottom as I would expect.   The people there were very nice, but unless there's an uptick in the quality of food, I doubt I'll come back. It wasn't bad, but there's too many good options nearby to not be great.",

They give you bread to start with, the dip they give you with the bread is soooo good. A perfectly creamy garlic sauce. Next we got patatas bravas, they were really good. The ones at the bottom got pretty soggy, but still tasty. I was happy to see some vegetarian options that looked really good. I had never had paella before, so I got the paella de vegetales. It was really good. And HUGE. I almost never bring leftovers home and I got to bring half my meal home. Only complaint was that it was a little too salty. Still good though. It was a pricey meal but not bad for the quality and portion you're getting.",

I took my friend here for her birthday the atmosphere was fantastic with the flamenco dancers and being right by the waterway. Our server Lauren, was very attentive and not trying to oversell us on anything. We had the pitcher of sangria which was strong and not too sweet, just how I like it. They had an abundance of tapas to choose from. The bread they give you to start off with the garlic aioli is so delicious(holy garlic breath, but worth it). We ordered the albondigas, egg dipped cod, potatoes with aioli, garlic shrimp,mussels with garlic sauce and the beef tenderloin. The only tapas I'd suggest skipping is the beef tenderloin, it was nothing to write home about. Overall a fabulous experience and I'd recommend to anyone in the area.",

Needless to say, every time since, I allow them to do it again and again for me.  Even though its a little pricy by the end of the night, I can not say enough good things about this restaurant.  It is great for date night and especially out on the patio when the weather is right.  A definite must dine at establishment in old town scottsdale.",

Our server was very very nice but at the end of the day as soon as we walked in at 10:20 (restaurant closes at 11:00pm) they were even hesitant to seat us. They scrambled around and asked if we had a reservation which we did, who knows what would've happened if we didn't. As soon as we sat down, our server told us the kitchen was about to close -- 40 minutes before the restaurant closes! -- Anyways, we ordered our food and in anticipation of the kitchen closing we ordered out desert at the same time. When our food arrived, our tapas came out and guess what else came out? Our dessert. It sat at the corner of our table while we ate dinner and until we were ready for it. They pretty much rushed us out of the restaurant.   With the location in combination with the ambiance, I would've never expected this restaurants service to be as bad as it was on a Saturday night. The kitchen was \"closing\" 40 minutes before the restaurant did, the food runners literally packed all our food on the table at the same time so we could finish and leave. On top of that, all the servers were sitting by the bar on their phones basically waiting for us and the two other families next to us to finish and leave so they could go home. That's not how good quality restaurants should be!",

    "text": "We had reservations as a part of Arizona restaurant week.  We went into it looking forward to trying a new tapas experience in AZ.  We were huge fans of the late Sol Y Sambra.    Everything was going well, helpful server made suggestions that we chose to follow and ordered one additional tapas to try as well.  When the tapas course arrived I had to ask what one of them was.  The server had mis-heard what I wanted and brought the wrong dish.  OK, he picked the dish up and headed back to the kitchen after saying he thought we had asked for that particular dish.  In a minute the manager appeared at the table next to us with that exact same dish telling the table that there had been a mix up and here is an extra tapas for them to enjoy - HUH?    At no point was it mentioned that the dish had already been served to another table.  We were not offered the dish to try even though it was a mistake nor were we offered any apology or additional dishes for the mistake.  When the incident was addressed to the manager to express the upset, he made no attempt to right the wrong or address the problem.  When the correct tapas finally arrived at the table, it looked like a can of tomato soup dumped over tomatoes - that was my last straw.  The server came over and I let him know that we were not interested in continuing the meal and wanted to leave.  He said he would let the manager know and the manager made no attempt to come speak with me at our table.  They offered to comp the meal if we wanted to stay or we could go.  For the first time in my life I opted to leave.  Inexcusably poor customer service, questionable sanitary food practices and mediocre food from the one dish I tasted.  I would not recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "ambiance: beautiful moorish archways inside, gorgeous al fresco dining, they had a guitarist there who was great, on saturdays they have flamenco performances (i was there on a sunday) service: ok, they had a lot of new servers, they are dressed like they are about to run with the bulls! I gave them 2 stars for ambiance  If you like their food, then you don't know what authentic yummy tapas are supposed to taste like  but when i go out to eat tapas, I expect something better than my home cooking. I knew after I looked at their extensive menu that they food would be so-so, reheated, or something like that. How could restaurant have all those choices, with foods that require lengthy preparation, and the restaurant was only 1/4 full on a sunday.  Highlights: free bread: pan de sal, rolls served with garlic sauce (or what they call aioli). they garlic sauce was yum....but when the dishes started to come out...i was disappointed...they all had the same garlic aoili  I typically order the following tapas at each tapas restaurant I try out to see how each one compares to each other, i've toured spain and ate a tons of tapas places so I know how it should taste:  1) Tortilla espanola 2) Patatas Bravas 3) Pan tomate  4) Paella Valenciana 5) Red Sangria 6) Croquettas (if they are on the menu, very few restaurants serve these) 7) Sepia(cuttlefish)/Calamares (squid)/ or Pulpo (octopus) a la Plancha  I didn't end up ordering the pan tomate or the tortilla espanola this time. They didn't have a \"---\" a la plancha on the menu either.. Duh, becuase in order to serve seafood a la plancha it has to be fresh and everything here tasted reheated.  We ordered:  1) patatas bravas: tasted/looked like KFC potato wedges with La Tapatia sauce.  Don't get me wrong, they still tasted decent but they were not authentic 2) fried artichoke with aoili: luke warm brined artichoke with beer batter  lying in a puddle of the garlic aoili suace (yes, the same one that was served with bread) 3) escargot: basically your average canned escargot in garlic/parsley sauce with drizzles of garlic aoili suace (yes, the same one served with the bread), this tasted good, but when does escargot in garlic butter not tasted good? 4) Paella Valenciana: they did not use paella rice, they had too much green bell pepper saute on it, the chorizo? i thought it was cut up vienna sausage at first, but it was chorizo, just in miniature form, they should have just minced it, the rice was more like a stew because there was tons of broth left in the pan, so no burnt soccarrat at the bottom to enjoy, you could tell the rice was blanced earlier and then tossed together with the ingredients in a pot then placed in the paella pan for service...don't bother ordering this if you like paella...it will just piss you off..and where was the saffron essence? 5) ham & cheese croquettas: 3 luke warm croquettas lying in a puddle of the garlic aoili suaces, again: they inside should melt out of the crispy breading, but because it wasnt' hot enough or because the filling was made with too much flour, it didn't  Definitely DO NOT ORDER:  Sauteed mushrooms: it only took them 3 min to bring it out after we ordered them, they were soooo grey and nasty.  I couldn't eat another bite! they were only warmed through...ugh yuck!  Stuffed squid braised with squid ink: i've had a version of this tapa several times so I know this stuff had to be good. Wrong.  The squid stuffing was luke warm in the middle. The ink sauce was missing something, it was heavily diluted with the flavor of chicken bouillion cube broth.",

    "text": "So I had my first experience with Tapas last night. Our first blunder was with the host. We didn't have reservations and they gave us this look, like we didn't belong. Bad first impression I thought and I was like well we will just sit at the bar then, which I find better anyways, and they complied. The bartender was very informative with the menu and gave us some suggestions, so he made up for the host. After a round of drinks our food arrived and the presentations was very aesthetically appealing. After trying a single bite of each dish, all I have to say is that the food was fantastic!! A friend and myself went here with no expectations and we were delightfully pleased on the type of meal in which we received. We split 4 dishes. We had a shrimp dish, a lamb, a chicken, and a squid stuffed with cuddle fish. The food was divine.  My only real complaint about that place is how loud it is. They have a live band. I'm not sure if it's every night or only on the weekends. Though the band was exceptionally good and they had a dancer it was so friggin loud. My friend and I were pretty much screaming at each other the entire night and we were literally right next to each other sitting at the bar. That's why I will give this place a 4 stars instead of 5. I will definitely be back though. Maybe for lunch instead of dinner though.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I was very excited thinking about a new Spanish restaurant in town as they are few and far between around here. Having traveled quite a bit in Spain we are huge fans of tapas and paella. So we went to Tapas Papa Frita with great anticipation for a delicious meal. I am sad to say that this restaurant was a complete letdown for a variety of reasons.   The restaurant itself is absolutely lovely. I loved the way the place was decorated with representation of Joan Miro's work, since he is one of my all time favorite artists. The restaurant presents itself very nicely.   We decided to try this restaurant also because their website advertised \"During the month of August...everything on the menu will be buy one and receive the second one at no charge\" for happy hour 5-7pm. Our interpretation of this was that you could buy one item and choose another item for free. The reality was that it was buy one item and get a double portion. This was not clearly worded on their website.   We sat at the bar and were immediately met with a pretentious attitude form the bar tender which is typical, but unfortunate, in many Scottsdale restaurants. He became more rude when he found out we did not want to order drinks.  This makes no sense to me because the meals cost quite a bit more than drinks would have so it's not like his tip would have suffered. After that he left us to sit for a very long time before taking our order. So long in fact that the manager had to come around to see why our order hadn't been taken. The bartender finally came around after a prompting from his manager and took our order.   We ordered Txipirones en su Pinto (stuffed squid) and Alcachofa a la Romana (fried artichokes) for our tapas. For dinner we ordered the Paella Valenciana for our entree, to be shared since it was double portion. The fried artichokes arrived on the cool side and the batter was soggy. As I pulled the batter away from one of the artichokes I could taste that it was a marinated artichoke, which was clearly canned or jarred. The appetizer was soggy and unappealing. The stuffed squid arrived and for a \"double portion\" as the happy hour special stated, we received 3 squid. My question is what is the full sized portion? 1.5 squid? The squid was tasty, it was served in what I'm assuming was a blank ink sauce with a spicy tomato sauce on the side. This was the only redeemable part of our meal, it really was quite good. The bread and aioli that was served before the meal was also very good.   On to the entree, our \"double portion\" of the Paella Valenciana. I should say that we've eaten enough tapas and paella in Spain to where we have a very good idea what to expect from these classic dishes. This was not authentic Spanish paella. First it's impossible that it be truly authentic since it came out in about 15 minutes, traditional paella takes at least 45 minutes to prepare. It was served in a cast iron skillet but it did not have that chewy, crunchy texture that paella has when it's actually finished in the oven. The rice was on the firmer side when it should be mushy and there was a flavorless watery broth whereas True paella should be rich with saffron flavor and the rice should have absorbed any liquid that it was cooked in. The sausage that it was prepared with was tasty but incredibly salty. The chicken was dark meat which I found disappointing. The shellfish was fine, albeit the shrimp were overcooked. Overall I am very sad to say that it was a terrible dish of paella, it was not authentic and not even really worth eating which is why we left a third of it behind.   Lastly, the restaurant was very warm and the bathrooms appeared to have no air conditioning or the vents were closed. It was 110 degrees today and they had 2 doors right by the bar where we were sitting propped wide open. I understand that it's a new restaurant and they wanted passersby to know that they were open; however, in this day of eco-consciousness, I found this to be an unconscionable waste of energy. Moreover it made the restaurant very warm and uncomfortable. So in my opinion the doors being open resulted in a lose lose situation.   Thankfully our bill was low due to the \"double portion\" special because I would have been incredibly disgruntled had we paid full price for bad food and bad service. I think Tapas Papa Frita has a nice concept, but they are definitely not ready for prime time.  I can tolerate a pretentious Scottsdale restaurant when the food is dynamite, but this is not the case at Tapas Papa Frita. It's both pretentious and serves bad food. It's a pity because the place is lovely. I hope they pull it together so they can stay in business, but we will not be returning here.  PS* patxi g. who reviewed right below clearly works for this place as he reiterated the same bad wording of the happy hour special and the review seems overly phony.",

The food was great, the service was the perfect amount (not too much and not too little) and the ambiance was great! A few of the favorites from our party of 4's meals... Squid ink tapa, crab meat filled peppers, blue cheese steak, seafood bowl, rabbit, ox tail, and the flan! The best flan any of us had ever had.",

    "text": "Great food, the Head of the House is awkward, lacks passion and personality  I have been anxious for a Tapas place ever since Mexican Stand Still was to open in the space that is now Tapas Papa Frita.  So needless to say I was very optimistic when I saw a new restuarant was taking place of Mexican Standoff.   When we went there, we were in jeans and t-shirts which several other patrons were also wearing.  I don't know if it is because I have visible tattoos or if it is the lack of personality of the front of the house that caused the awkward interactions with him.  We walked in and he awkwardly shook our hands, like he was sizing us up??? It was very odd I didn't know how or what to make of it.  When we told him that there was just the two of us he asked if we wanted a table or sit at the bar.  When we said table, he said he liked starting people off at the bar.  When I asked why he couldn't really give me a reason.    After being sat I began worrying that this was an awful decision.  But then our amazing waiter, Timothy came out and was great! He made great recommendations and was friendly and very conversational.  We each ordered 4 tapas each out of which the oxtail, monk fish were the favorites.   The Head of the House walked around and it seemed almost like he was too shy or embarrassed as he approached tables around the restaurant.  When he came to the tables and asked us how we were doing not trying to engage us, it felt as I should have been at a Olive Garden. Engage me! Talk to me more about the food, the region the Chef is from.  I am at your new restaurant?  Cocktails:   On their website they list the sangrias, specialty cocktails and martinis when I asked about the cocktails and martinis they replied that they didn't have any but there was a full bar.  Not Timothy's fault, he is new and the restaurant so I will let that slip.     Ambiance - I would give it an A+ the views, decor spot on.  When you go into the men's restroom there are the beatnik paintings that were in Digestif by the bar...not sure what that has to do with Spain.   Overall, I would go back even with the head of house who is lacking personality and passion.  When I go back I will definitely ask to sit in Timothy's section!",

    "text": "Even though the food was quite good, I have to give this place a poor review because our overall experience was so unpleasant.  We went on a Thursday night when there was live music and flamenco dancing.  It was so loud - starting rather early at 7:30 p.m. - and completely interfered with our ability to have any conversation at our table.    I will say that the food was pretty good.  I'd characterize it as pretty traditional Spanish tapas.  Our table particularly enjoyed the oxtail, the crab stuffed piquillo peppers and the patatas bravas.  Great sauces on the oxtail, the snails and the shrimp.  I'd go back but only Monday through Wednesday when it would be quieter.",

    "text": "Goodness!  I'm not even sure where to begin!!  What a wonderful, delightful, evening our party of three enjoyed here!  From the moment we stepped through the door the magic began! We were a party of three  -   two males and one female with mixed ages  --  29 to 63 and I can honestly say Tapas appeals to all age groups.  It's both lively and elegant all at once with something for everyone.     The servers are all in white with red sashes around their waists  -  you feel as though you are in Spain and not Scottsdale!!  Not too mention how nice they all are. Our server was soooooo friendly and helpful in explaining everything and also with suggestions. You felt he was excited about being able to wait on YOU!!  Now that is not found in very many places.      We shared many different tapas between the three of us along with two dessests and I can tell you there was not a crumb left on any of the plates.  Plus the ROLLS  -- OMG  --  these are served first along with a dip.  They are made fresh everyday and are piping hot when they come to you.  They are to die for!!  OK  - we may be a little dramatic here because we happen to be three bread lovers but then again who better to critique a good piece of bread???  We had the sangria with lots ice and it was perfect with the meal on a hot summer night.       We are already planning our next trip back and taking some friends. Eventually we hope to try everything on the menu because every item listed sounded absolutely wonderful!!!  I cannot remember the \"official\" name of the one dessert we had but it was a different twist to Creme Brulee ---  I think it was a little caramel drizzled on the bottom,  topped by a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a bit of fresh fruit and then the traditional caramelized sugar on top  ---  I think I dreamed about it last night!!     Oh! Did I mention entertainment??  Incrediable Spanish Guitar players and Flamenco dancing. Between them and the menu nothing we ever had in Spain came close to our experience here last night  --  and this is a lot closer than traveling to Spain!!  Of couse it certainly helps that the owner and cooks ARE from Spain  --  doesn't get much more authentic than that!  No wonder the experience was wonderful.    Now here's a really big news flash  --  Tapas has only been open a few weeks and with the food and service you would have thought it was an establishment that had been around for years.  OH!!  Also the most beautiful patio by the canal  ---  what ambiance this place has - both inside AND out.   You will want to return again and again just to experience everything!    You did good Scottsdale  --  you have a GEM in your city with Tapas!  I have no doubt as more people discover this JEWEL there will be a wait list for tables. We were there on a Thurs. evening and it was busy.  I can hardly wait to show it off to out of town guests!",

He was helpful in recommending some delicious tapas...but then he went over to the other staff and yelled \"someone needs to figure out who is helping that table!\" he never came back either....about 1 hour after arriving we finally got our meal. These were the smallest sized tapas I ever had. They were delicious but only a couple of bites for two people to share per plate. For the price I expected more.

    "text": "Went here last week with two other couples for the Happy Hour.  First, the facility is very attractive, with a rustic, old hacienda feeling.  Because it was a nice afternoon we sat on the patio.  We were fortunate to sit on the east side of the patio because it not only protected as from the afternoon sun but the north side looks over the muddy irrigation canal Scottsdale promotes as \"The Waterfront\" while the east side overlooks Stetson St.  Happy Hour has a limited selection of $3 tapas.  My wife and I shared the meatballs, chix w/ saffron rice, and the pork bruschetta.  We found them okay, nothing special, and a bit skimpy in portion size, except for the rice.  There were 3 small meatballs, which were good.  The pork consisted of 2 small pieces of meat on wooden skewers.  The chix w/saffron rice was the best of the three in terms of taste and quantity.  Of the other four people with us, three felt as we did that the food was okay while the fourth thought the food was horrible.  Happy Hour also has two-for-one sangria and house wines.  Opt for the wine because the sangria, while flavorful is a very small serving.  We would not make a special effort to return here for Happy Hour but if we were in the vicinity would probably stop.  Be very careful of the waiter pushing their paella specials!  Prices are $25 or $45 PER PERSON which is not emphasized by the waiter so you could get a big surprise.",

    "text": "Um.. how about no? Yeah, this place is a horrible disappointment. We were a group of 9 that came in to dine. I asked the server how their Sangria was. I swear he looked at me like I've asked him for his kidney. He replies \"what do you want me to say? Of course its good\". If I wanted standoffish, smart alecky replies to questions, I would've dined with my extended family. Anyway, the Sangria finally arrives and as I guessed, the quality of the drink was almost as terrible as the service. We weren't given menus for like 25 minutes after being seated. Good lord, how they are still in business is something that is beyond me.   We placed our orders for tapas after finally getting the menus. I ordered the special of the day, which was a ravioli in a pesto cream sauce, their version of a Spanish sausage and something else that was clearly so forgettable that I don't even recall what it was. The sausage had enough salt to season food for the state of Arizona. To make it worse, the texture was like rubber. Ugh.. I'm sure it managed to kill three fourth of my taste buds. Moving on to the ravioli with the so called pesto... I couldn't even get a hint of basil up in there. Not sure if there is an alternate definition of pesto in Spanish cuisine. This was however the most appetizing of everything I tasted that night. My friends ordered a wide variety of tapas and all of them were sub par to borderline unpleasant. The lamb chop my friend ordered was like jerky, the clams were overcooked, bacon wrapped dates was overdone too.. the list goes on. To make things worse, I had to pay $65 for the meal.. all this for a couple of drinks and three small tapas. The prices here are outrageous with dreadful food and service! The extra star is for the shrimp I tried from my friend's plate, and it wasn't the worst thing that night. Wouldn't return at any cost.",

    "text": "4 stars for the food, +1 for the service.  Went here last may during an outing with the girls (we were shopping and randomly yelped here cuz the building looked fancy)  It wasn't too busy, and we we seated next to a window overlooking the plaza. They were very accomodating, rearranging tables and seats to seat all of us.   I ordered a lamb chop appetizer and a seafood Valencia paella. The lamb chop ($10?) was expensive for the size, but wow, it tasted great. My standard for lamb  was firm meat with a distinct \"lamb smell\". The one here was very juicy and soft. No tough fibers here!  When my paella came out, somehow the server mistook my request of \"no onions\" for \"no onions and clams\". I told the server, and a few minutes later, the cook himself came out and apologized for the error. He told me that he'll give me a bowl of clams instead of the 3-4 that's usually included in the pan. wow! thanks!  In the meantime, I ate a bit of the paella - the texture of the rice is very soft, like a risotto. the rice was soft, but not mushy. Peas, sausage and shrimp were nicely seasoned. Clams were nicely buttered with a hit of herbs.   Later on, the chef came out to check up on us again, and we reassured him the food was great (we also tried the banana pudding, the fried banana, the calamari, it was great)  This was the first time I tipped so much because of how amicable the staff was and I had such a great experience. If i'm ever in the area again, for sure I'll be coming back - you don't see places that specialize in paella in many places!",

I did not have much time since I had a meeting and they take some time to cook their food. I was offered nothing in return and not even an apology. It was a bad experience. People working in \"In-n-out\" always apologize and fix their mistake right away. Go learn from a fast food restaurant since they know what they're doing.",

Every tapa I've ordered has been amazingly good (and the bread that they bring to the table, with the dip, is to die for) and they have an awesome selection of reasonably priced wines.

I'll keep it short:   Food: Not particularly good. Nothing offensive, but all of the flavor was muddy and dull.   Drinks: Sangria came in a lowball glass (wut) and was a Oliver Twist level stingy serving. Like, dude. I did not pay $10 for 5 oz. of drink.   Service: The waiter was uncomfortably gushy, but after we order we didn't see him again. We were barreled at breakneck speed through our meal and then left to wait on the check for fifteen minutes while our waiter talked with his co-workers at the bar.   Also, the menu design was terrible. But also, they had mints on the way out which is why they got a 2 star instead of 1 star.",

We told our server before ordering that we wanted to pay separately and when it came time for the check it took her half an hour to get us the bill. When she brought us the bill we were told if we wanted to pay separately it was going to \"take her a while\" because she couldn't figure it out. In desperation to get out of there we ended up having to just split the bill between us evenly which was not fair since not everyone got the same thing or drank as much. Neither the server or management was apologetic at all or willing to take anything off our $1500 bill to accommodate us because of such a poor experience. The food was also purely average. I don't recommend this to anyone.",

    "text": "My friends and I love going outside of our comfort zone and try different ethnic food once in a while. We all planned a week ahead of time to eat at this local Spanish restaurant in Scottsdale. Personality, this was my first time trying Spanish food. I was very excited all week looking forward to come here. This general area is almost like a maze. It did take us a while to find out where it was located at. No matter if it was a good restaurant right? When we first arrived, I was impressed by their beautiful decorations and relaxing atmosphere in the patio area. I wanted to sit in the outside. But since it did rain here and there. It was best to sit in. That was when all hell broke loose.   Shortly after we seat down, the hostess gave us total of 4 menus. Two of which involved alcohol beverages. To avoid the clutter on the table since none of us were drinker, I politely asked her to take those two menus away. She looked annoyed and unhappy. Whatever. When our waiter arrived, he also started talking about drinks. I immediately told him the same thing again. Most high end restaurant would be smart enough to pick up all the wine glasses at this point in time, he didn't. We had to ask him instead. He responded by saying \"I will in a minute\" when we were the first table who arrived here. Hmm...r u too busy? He immediately rushed away from our table when we were all ready to order our drinks. This is definitely a bad start for a supposedly nice dining experience. While we were waiting for our drinks, I could hear someone in the kitchen yelling for another person for a minute straight. Really...? Staffs were all loud talking among each other as though we weren't even there. I definitely did not expect that from a nice restaurant in Scottsdale.   The food. Where should I begin? Every other clams that I chewed on have sand in it. My friend bite into one of the few and literally hurt her tooth. Unacceptable. I don't even want to bother with describing the taste of each individual dish. All I could tell u was their presentation was beautiful. But the food was tasteless. The Paella that I tried was covered with grease and the rice was soaked in too much juice. It might have been presented in a steel pan but trust me..it was precooked and reheated back up. I was extremely unsatisfied with the meals and the shitty service that we received. The waiter hardly gave us refill unless he was asked over and over again. He quickly rushed in and out of our tables even when it wasn't busy.   The only reason I still give it a 2 star is because their dessert was very delicious. Especially their homemade coconut ice cream that was served on a coconut. Their churros was served with chocolate syrups. That was heavenly delicious. I don't mind paying for a expensive meal when the food and service was great. But really...it was not worth it. I advice you to go somewhere else and save your money.",

We had dinner reservations some were able to get a table immediately upon arrival.  However, it took 20 minutes for a drink of water to arrive and another 30 minutes for a bread basket to show up. Food took an inordinate amount of time and they even came back to say that they ran out of hummus after a wait of 50 minutes!!  Unbelievably poor service.  I would be prepared to excuse the typical delays on a packed night but tis is the second time we visited the restaurant and the second time that their service failed.  Flamenco and Spanish guitar was great but we will not be going back again.  There are far better places in Scottsdale that are worth the big bucks that this place charges.

Honestly the food smelled pretty good and the place looked nice BUT apparently now in today's society and in this place, you have to be a certain age to order chicken tenders... you call this freedom?! Absolutely devastating. Truly disappointed. So parents. If your child is 11 years old and wants some good o' chicken tenders. This isn't the place for you. I can't believe this. I have to be under 10 years old to order chicken tenders with fries for about $7. I'm better off going to old reliable fast food. I bet they serve chicken tenders to people above 10 years old. This will not stand. The chicken was pretty good though. But was not worth the 1 hour and 30 minute wait and $13. I waited too long for my food. They don't even have lemonade. I don't see myself going here again. Too long of a wait. No chicken tenders if you're above 10 years old and no lemonade. Devastating. They don't even have a menu for the drinks. They tell you what they have but damn I order some sweet ice tea and that thing was as bitter as ripe lemon. They didn't even tell me they had pineapple juice. I would have gotten that but how was I supposed to know if they actually had pineapple juice? I found out when someone near us was served pineapple juice. And lastly one of my friends had to wait 1 hour for a glass of water. That's honestly pretty messed up. It's not like he asked once. He asked 5 damn times. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take that long to serve someone water. I have no idea how it is for other people but for us it was a bad experience.",

    "text": "Unfortunately have to knock off a couple stars after this past Valentine's Day. Perhaps our expectations were too high after our first experience a couple years ago, but I can't possibly leave this place at a 5 star review.  Unlike the previous Valentine's Day, we had a reservation this time so we ate earlier and it was very busy. We were unfortunately seated directly next to the stage with the live music, and they were decent enough but it was sooooooo loud! My boyfriend and I literally couldn't speak to each other while the music was playing because it was far too noisy, and it was near impossible to understand the waiter when he came by which was very frustrating. We considered asking for another table, but since the place was packed there was no chance of this happening.  We still tried to enjoy the night and ordered from the special Valentine's Day menu as before. The tapas were by far the highlight of the night, particularly the crab stuffed peppers, grilled shrimp, and oooh the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese... I still dream about those delicious little things.  Sadly though they didn't have the same choices for entrees as they did previously, which was a real bummer since the ones we had before were excellent. The only thing that really piqued our interest was the paella with clams, mussels, chicken, and sausage, so we got a large serving of that. It was very average, the flavor was decent but nothing really spectacular, and it was very watery as well. Really a disappointment compared to our previous Valentine's Day dinner here, and just didn't feel as special.  Perhaps we'll try again in the future or go on a normal day for their regular menu, but I still wish our most recent Valentine's Day experience could've matched our first.",

    "text": "I give this spot 3 stars because of the flavor in the dishes. However the ambiance was lively and the staff were definitely on point checking on us and refilling water etc. The back room we were in got warm and it started getting uncomfortable mid meal. Mind you we were a large group (20+) so take that into consideration.  Now for the eats:   Starters:  Bread with a dipping garlic aioli ....we called it crack sauce because we couldn't stop eating it!  Campinones al jerez - mushrooms with garlic sauce. The dish ws as definitely served hot and you could taste the garlic. I'd say get some bread on the side to dip the sauce.  Pastel a la porrusalda - leek stuffed pastry...probably one of my favorite items.  Pollo al Ajillo - chicken thigh with a lemon and garlic sauce....the chicken was really tender, cooked well but the flavors didn't soak in well but when you did try the sauce it was delicious!  Other items:  Gambas al ajillo - shrimp was cooked well.and the sauce was tasty. Anotjer favorite of mine  Datiles con tocino - bacon wrapped dates....was alsona favorite of the table however some weren't fans of the \"bbq\" type sauce and some were.  Chuletilla de cordero - lamb chops...while it was flavorful it was slightly overcooked.  Dessert:  Manzana al horno - this one had all the right flavors to end the meal! The caramel drizzle was a bit sweet but with the ice cream it was tasty.  Churros con choclate- definitely a favorite of the room. The chocolate sauce that came for dipping was amazing.   I'll be back maybe a smaller group to try the items again :)",

    "text": "I've been meaning to check out Tapas Papa Frita for years, but have always put it off because I was swayed by mediocre yelp reviews. Well, this restaurant week, the dude and I decided to finally pull the trigger and give it a try. We made our reservations and headed out to dinner on a shockingly chilly May night.   Walking up, we were excited to see that there was live music on the patio. However, since it was a little chilly, we opted for an indoor table. The interior was unexpectedly spacious for a waterfront restaurant, and had a nice ambience to it. All of the staff were friendly and attentive, which seems to be most of the issues among negative reviews.   The restaurant week menu seemed like a great deal, since you get a handful of tapas as well as an entree and dessert. We each went with the original tapas, which included manchego cheese, bacon-wrapped goat cheese dates, garlic shrimp, and crab-mix stuffed piquillo peppers. All of these were gluten free except for the stuffed pepper, so I got both of those since the dude can't have gluten--it was a fair trade though, I offered him my stuffed date because I can't hang with goat cheese. The stuffed pepper was tasty, but incredibly filling for a tiny lil thang. It didn't taste super crabby, but was yummy nonetheless. The shrimp were good but not revolutionary, and same with the manchego. The dude says that the stuffed dates were incredible.   For our entrees, he went with the manchego-crusted salmon, and I opted for the vegetable paella. His salmon had a nice flavor to it, though I wouldn't necessarily call it \"crusted,\" probably closer to just \"melted.\" But it was good. I was not a fan of my paella, which was a super bummer. The flavor was okay, and I loved all of the veggies in it, but it was very very wet. Like, took home the leftovers and reheated them in the microwave the next day and it was still wet. I was very disappointed, as paella is one of my favorite dishes, and generally Spanish tapas places do a great job with it.   He had the fried plantains for dessert, which were delicious. I had the churros which were good but again, not revolutionary.  We got a pitcher of the red sangria, which was very yummy and absolutely filled to the brim. It seemed like an insane amount of liquid, but I was quite happy about it.   Overall, everything probably averaged out to fine. Would probably recommend sticking with tapas here, and definitely recommend treating yourself to the generous helpings of sangria.",

We got here pretty early before the Friday evening rush, which ensured great service for the first half of our dinner.  The food was excellent! We ordered a bunch of seafood tapas, pitcher of white sangria which was light and refreshing on a hot summer evening, Valencia paella and finished dinner with a creme brulee.   Our server was very nice and attentive before the rush. When I saw him inside the restaurant I noticed that every server was slammed and running around with sweat dripping off their foreheads.  Having experience in the service industry, it seemed like the restaurant was understaffed, which is something management should try to address since the restaurant is charming and beautiful and the food was great as well!  Will be back for sure!",

I was able to try quite a bit because we did family style dinning (definitely would recommend this).   The bread came with a garlic-mayo dip which was pretty delicious.   The pitchers of Red Sangria were delightful.   Chuletilla de cordero - Lamb Chops had great flavor.  The Champinones al Jerez (mushrooms in garlic sauce) was okay and needed more zest/spice  The Patatas Bravas was good but pretty much tasted like seasoned potato wedges.   Pastel a la Porrusalda was a puff pastry with leeks/cheese. This was decent and tasted similar to a Spanakopita(leek instead of spinach).  Sarsuela Diablo (shrimp, calms, mussels, calamari) came in a spicy red sauce and had great flavor.   Pollo al Ajillo (chicken thigh) was tender but pretty bland. Do not recommend this one.  Churros con Chocolate - 4 warm churros with a side of hot chocolate and strawberries - just delicious!  Pastel de Avellana Americana (hazelnut nutella cheesecake) - creamy, subtle, not too sweet..mmm!  Definitely enjoyed the variety! A good place to socialize and have tapas/drinks with company(large or small).",

We picked the perfect night to try this place with the Scottsdazzle tree lighting and live orchestra music at the Waterfront. We had an amazing seat on the patio with a view of the water, a beautiful fireplace, and we could see inside to watch the flamenco dancer and musicians.   My family had two different kinds of paella, and they were both great. But I was there for the namesake: the tapas, and most were overpriced and underwhelming. My absolute favorite was the pastel a la porrusalda (leek tart), and I also enjoyed the atun con sandia (rare tuna with watermelon). The waiter recommended pimiento piquillo con centollo (a crab-stuffed pepper), and it was very bland and slimy. Other tapas like the gambas and stuffed portabello that we ordered for the table were average.   Our wait staff were very friendly but also over-extended, so we had to ask for a lot without it coming out (bread, an order that never came, etc.). It also took our dessert over 30 minutes to arrive, but the waiter did take care of that for us by taking it off the bill. I just got the feeling someone called in sick because they seemed like they were rushing from table to table.   My take is come for some vino tinto and paella, but skip the tapas unless you want the leek tart.",

Leave alone the yelp ratings - I should've listened - and didn't because I was too jetlagged and tired and hungry. Hangry actually.  Cold food. Flip flop rubber sepia, an ingredient I cook and can't handle cold and rubbery. HORRIBLE croquettes HORRIBLE. Bad. I'm almost sure it was the bottom of a flip flop.

We made a reservation and asked to be sat near the dancers.  We were sat as soon as we arrived and had front row seats for a great experience.   the four of us ordered about 20 tapas and a couple different types of paella.  When the plates were all finished we went in for dessert.    We have sent a few friends there and they also enjoyed the experience.   My only 'concern' or noted 'flaw' with the restaurant was their wine list.  I expected to see more spanish wines and a larger selection.  If they can get a good sommelier to put together a more complete and rounded wine selection we would be there on a very regular basis.

First glance of the place and I new I was in for a fun night full with Flamenco, Sangria, Paella and Tapas Papa Frita! Nice ambiance Spanish Style with romantic and very fitting live Flamenco entertainment. Prices were reasonable for as much or as little as wished. Your choice of Tapas topped off with a Paella for two! Walking distance to the Casablanca Lounge Outdoor patio.....European fun hopping adventure for sure!",

We got a great seat outside on the patio facing the common area which had a band and was great ambiance. Service was quick, friendly and authentic! We enjoyed some great tapas starters before sharing the signature paella..which was fantastic!! We washed it all down with some wonderful white wine sangria. Would definitely return if we could and maybe sit inside to enjoy the flamenco dancing and music.",

    "text": "I work at centurion restaurant in downtown Phoenix and had one of the servers from here come into my work. She was delightful and recommended I come try it out- what a recommendation it was! My girlfriend and I came here on a Monday evening during happy hour (which is 7 days a week) and sampled the entire tapas happy hour menu and had our fill of the red sangria as well. All of it was phenomenal! Once happy hour ended we were still hungry and decided to share the arros negre paella. This dish was truly authentic Spanish cuisine; calamari and prawns with blacks beans, rice, peas and doused black with squid ink. it looks intimidating but if you can get past the rich black color, the flavor is remarkable. Absolutely delish. We also both enjoyed a glass of wine recommended by our server Laura, who is from chihuahua, Mexico and has an accent that is as enticing as the food. She was very knowledgeable and provided wonderful service. It was obvious she was passionate about her work and providing a memorable experience. This is definitely my new favorite restaurant and will be back time and time again. My only issue is that I can't tell more people about it fast enough. Can't wait for my next visit!!",

    "text": "OK, realllllly did not want to write a poor review of this place.  I even thought about it for week before I did, but they have done themselves in here! My honey and I went last Saturday for \"happy hour\".  I love tapas and haven't been able to find a great spot since Sol y Sombra shut down, so we thought we would give them a try.  It was a beautiful evening, and they offer a 2-4-1 happy hour on the patio or in the bar.     So we spent two hours enjoying their delicious tapas, wine, sangria, and even dessert and coffee.  Food and drink were both amazing, and the service was attentive and gracious.  Sadly, thats as glowing as this review is gonna get because they have royally pissed me off.   Where they really went wrong was with what happened after.  So we got our \"happy hour\" tab, signed the receipt, and left.  I have to admit this was partially my fault because I tend to sign credit card slips with reckless abandon and utter disregard for the total(denial is not just a river in Egypt people), which was in this case, $93 plus a $20 tip.   So we get home, still talking about how delicious everything was, and I casually throw the receipt on the counter.  The sangria has now worn off.... $93? For happy hour? Yikes.  So apparently our server neglected to price our drinks out at happy hour pricing.  And the servings had been pretty small, even for tapas, certainly not the double portions that are supposed to arrive between 5 and 7.  So I called the restaurant immediately.  Having worked in restaurants before, I usually pick my battles, but since we had gone for happy hour intentionally based on what we read on Yelp, this called for attention.   SO I called the restaurant right away, and was apologized to profusely. Yes, I was correct, we had not received the happy hour portions that we should have ( which was probably why we ordered so many tapas) and we were charged double what we should have been for our drinks.  The sweet guy on the phone informed me that there was no manager available as it was a busy time on Saturday night, but that they would certainly make this right, and a manager would call me tomorrow.  Seemed reasonable so I gave them my number and waited.  Sunday, no call.  So Monday I called and left another messgae. Tuesday, still no call.  So I emailed them.    So a week later, no call, no email, nothing.  Like I said, I really don't want to give these guys a bad write up, but this is just about the worst customer service I have encoutered in a while. I personally will not return, despite a craving for their crab stuffed peppers.  If you want to chance it, go ahead, you will have a great time but will certainly pay for it!   It's really a shame because stuff like this is why otherwise great places seem to cycle in and out of this area way to fast.",

I'd blame management for his ingnorance.  The wine list was extensive and reasonable, and dessert was acceptable.  They had an excellent guitarrist playing classic flamenco on the patio, so I'd recommend this place for a glass of wine and live music on a nice day or night, but don't go hungry or you'll be dissapointed.",

I saw a paella that I really wanted to try (paella diablo), but it is typically a very large portion meant for two people to share.  Unfortunately, my wife isn't all that into spicy food, so I thought I would take a chance and see if they could make me a smaller portion.  My waiter went and asked the chef if they could accommodate that request and the chef was very willing to do so!  It was excellent and I was very happy to see that they could take the extra steps to make me happy!  The live music and dancer were also very entertaining.  Definitely check it out.",

When you are part of a group of this size, I give lots of credit to the restaurant staff and kitchen and cut them some slack.  BUT there was ONE service for the entire group.  The server agreed upon arrival he could do separate checks since everyone's bill was the same... almost everyone ordered the $25 tapas special.  Each person ate the same tapas, paid the same for them except of course they had different types of drinks.  I'm not an exaggerator, once the bills came, the server handed some out, collected some payment, 25 minutes later gave the rest of us our bills, ours was incorrect, had to fix it but no joke 90 minutes later we finally walked out. 11 pm. The saddest part was management didn't come around and assist their server, nor show any concern.  We were a large group that brought in a lot of revenue that evening, I wish we would have felt appreciated.  How many servers do you think should take care of a 23 person top? Or atleast have some server assistance and use more than on POSI machine to close us out.",

    "text": "Estoy Apesadumbrado mis amigos!  My wife took me to Tapas Papa Frita to celebrate my 80th birthday.  We always seek out a truly fine place to celebrate special occasions and this restaurant was touted to be one of those places to keep up with our tradition.  First of all the location could not be better, a great location on the Canal with a nice patio.  However, if you go, make sure you are a party of 3 or more else you will be seated at a table for two, pushed up against a wall or in a corner, seated side by side. Larger parties get a nice table out in the dining room where you can breathe and enjoy the people who are with you.  We lived in Madrid for over 4 years and ate out nearly every night of our residence.  I love Spanish food, I cook Spanish dishes, I know Spanish cuisine.  The menu presented before us would be the envy of any Spanish Restaurant.  I immediately ordered a carafe of Sangria.  I thoroughly enjoy both the red and white version of Sangria.  What we were served tasted like a watered down pitcher of cheap wine.  Sorry!  My wife then ordered the Tigres - Steamed Mussels ala Basque, and I ordered the Sopa de Ajo - Roasted Garlic Soup.  Pretty darn good!  We thought that just maybe this place might have potential after all.  While we sat rubbing thighs together, due to the close proximity of our chairs at this small table stuck in an alcove between the bar and dining area, we decided on the Paella Valenciana - Seafood Paella.  Why?  Because it is my all-time favorite Spanish dish.  We would drive the 100 miles from Madrid to Valencia (or another seaside town) just to have Paella Valenciana.  (Don't think that we were hung up on Paella alone, we also enjoyed the Roast Suckling Pig served at Botins or the Slow Roasted Lamb at the Caves of Luis Candel).  We soon realized that we must have chosen the wrong evening to come to this restaurant.  The Paella for two arrived in a traditional looking Paella Pan in which all the ingredients are cooked together at one time.  My wife and I looked at each other and knew immediately that we had been hoodwinked.  Okay, I like sausage and chicken (believe it or not, both ingredients are a part of the traditional Paella) but where the hell was the seafood?  There were a few little cocktail shrimp and something else that we couldn't identify and a lot of non-seafood stuff.  BUT, the worst part was that all this stuff was dumped over WHITE RICE that was only bearable because the juices of the cooked meat mixed with the rice.  REAL Spanish Paella is made with real Spanish Safron, or at least Egyptian Safron, That gives the rice the color, the texture, and the flavor ... the very essence of the dish that sets it apart from any other dish on earth.  Sorry to say, we could not finish the meal.  Still hungry, we ordered desert and coffee, Pastel de Pan - Banana and Apple Bread Pudding that was okay.  So ... as I plod on in the twilight of my life I will continue to search of a really good Spanish restaurant in the New World.  Salute!",

So when I saw this, same name, logo, I assumed somehow same owners or some tie to the place I loved oh so long ago.  Oh how wrong I was..

Please note, it's M-E-M-B-R-I-L-L-O, not m-e-n-b-r-i-l-o (quince paste), so the typo instinctively told me, lack of detail to printing a menu with a typo.  Then the menu my husband had and mine, were not in the same order, so when he was pointing out croquetas, I couldn't find inside, by this time the waitress came by and stated oh, we like to confuse our guest and not organize the menu the same, she had a great sense of humor about it, but again, attention to detail.  I know it sounds super picky, who cares about a typo and order pages are, but again, those first details are a sign of what's to come.   I knew this wasn't an Asturian place, NEVER expected it to be, but FYI, Asturias does have some pretty decent typical (simple) dishes.  World Famous Chef Jose Andres is from Asturias, and he's done incredibly offering alot of cuisine from our province..   So the offering of Cabrales only, well, like I typed, totally biased.   (FYI, I didn't order it, because after you've had Cabrales from the caves of Cabrales, I'm sorry, I'm just not willing to try it anywhere else.)   We ordered the croquetas, cerdo de jamon and boquerones.  We got the croquetas within 5 minutes, so that was a bit disappointing, knowing that even if they were pre rolled/made and all it needed to do was frying, that it would take more than 5 minutes - so I assume that they were pre-cooked at some point.  I didn't know what kind they were, as I didn't find them on the menu, but they were supposed to be ham and cheese.  They had no flavor.  Just fried doughish, with alioli sauce, very bland, very disappointing.  There were 3 on the plate, and I only ate the 1.  Then came the cerdo and boquerones, another 2 mins after we were done with the croquetas.  I immediately touched the sauce with my finger, cause it didn't look hot, and it was lukewarm.  The boquerones were exactly what I expected, canned, oiled boquerones, which, if you've ever been to Galicia, you know some of the best seafood in the world is immediately canned, and a can of seafood can retail for $90.   (oh, I KNOW this wasn't it, but  a $5 can of boquerones is also good).   The pork had been cooked at least a day before - there is no way it was done that morning/day.  It wasn't cooked in the sauce either.  It was dry, almost like a dry pork chop you smother in sauce, but it never absorbed the sauce other than covering it when it was plated.  Besides dry, it was also warm to go with the warm sauce.  Not sure if warm was what they were going for (vs hot), but again, disappointing.  As I stated, boquerones were fine, decent can, so that was the only ok thing.  We were starving, but didn't order anything else but the check to go have lunch else where.  Service was friendly, It was lunch time, about 1 pm on Saturday, 11/12/11.  Sad to say we will never be back.  It wasn't worth complaining to the waitress, I wasn't looking for a freebie or comp, it was just bad food, taken with of shortcuts.",

Also, it costs $18 for slices of cheese...., which is a slightly cheaper than the main dish, paella ($19.99) It doesn't really make sense. Also, paella was over salted, and couldn't taste the seafood and other meat at all.... Including 2 glasses of wine, it ended up $80. Won't visit there again. Oh, two more things to mention: our glasses were covered with wine, which made our hands nasty, and table cloth became dirty. They never light up the candle on our table, then what's the point of putting the candle in the middle of the table?",

Service was prompt, courteous, and attentive.  The restaurant is open and airy, with good views of the neighborhood.  Ordered off the regular and happy hour menu.  Options off both menus were excellent.  Sangrias were smooth and very tasty, not the usual bad wine stuffed with fruit.  We had the spicy potato cake (5 stars), saffron rice with chicken (5 stars), leek tart (5 stars), Tortilla de Patatas (4 stars), Crab-stuffed peppers (5 stars), and Lamb Chops (4 stars - a little underdone for our taste).  An excellent range of well-blended tastes, definitely a welcome taste of Spain.  We'll be back when we can!",

    "text": "The tapas here are authentic.  At least that is what they tell me.  It wasn't like most of the tapas places I have had in the past.  Between the 4 of us that went, there were 11 dishes ordered.  Every single one of them was liked by at least 3 of the 4 people.  In fact, the only thing that wasn't liked was by me, and that was the anchovies.....just not my cup of tea.  Everyone else raved about them.   Other than the food being outstanding, the prices were as good or better.  Nothing on the tapas menu was more than $9.  These prices were very worth it.  So what did we order?  2 pitchers of red sangria, shrimp in a spicy sauce (which wasn't THAT spicy, but very good), calamari, serrano ham, crab stuffed peppers, snails (just wonderful), txistorra (basque style sausage), garlic chicken cassarole, white asparagus with aioli, manchego cheese, and potatoes with serrano ham.  It also came with fresh rolls and homemade aioli.  The aioli alone is worth the trip.  Also, we had to have our server bring more and more rolls because the sauces served with every dish were just amazing, and you wanted to sop it up with freshed baked warm rolls.  It was a very filling experience.   The Sangria was very good, but I am no authority on Sangria.  While we got the red, they also have white, green (made with Portuguese Vinho Verde), and sparkling (made with Cava....Spanish sparkling wine).  I have had better red Sangria's in the past, but this was well worth it, and at $22 for a pitcher, I thought it was a steal!  I encourage anyone to go to this place if you like tapas, Spanish food, a fun, vibrant scene, or a great patio.  It is a little hot for patio seating, but if you go late enough, you can handle it.  In October/November, it will be even better.   Another great thing...they are open late.  As one of the few people in this city that like to eat after 7 pm, I enjoy places that are open well past 10 pm.  I can't wait to go back again and try different items.  We are already getting a group together to try out a few of the 5 paella's offered.  If they are anywhere near as good as the tapas, we will find our new \"go to\" dinner joint.",

Terrible, slow, service paired with auto-gratuity that isn't deserved (the menu says 18% for large parties but our server opted to give himself 20%..), the food is delivered family-style (even if you each order individually) and if you don't pay close attention to what you ordered you'll find yourself missing food that they simply never brought out to your table (until you repeatedly ask where it is and they finally bring it two hours after your reservation time).  On a positive note, everything we ordered was delicious, especially the crab stuffed peppers!  But because of the other factors that occurred I would simply never visit this place again, no matter how good the food was. Working at a restaurant myself it is hard for me to overlook these issues especially since the staff didn't seem to care when we were having issues & still charged us for the food that we had to BEG to get because it was taking so long.",

The owner immediately swooped in like a vulture and went on and on about some wine he got for a steal. He offered it at the same price as our wine during happy hour. When we got the bill, each glass cost more than double!!  My friend and I ended up spending $120 each for happy hour. The food was decent enough but the owner of this establishment clearly took advantage of us. Obviously he's not looking to build clientele but to squeeze as much as he can out of his customers. I can't even begin to tell you how intrusive he was. He was at our table at least six times going on and on about this great wine that he charged us through the nose for. Now add that to the server and bus person's presence and my friend and I never had a moment alone. This was a nice meal that was ruined by a dishonest, overbearing hussler . Shame, shame. Where's your work ethic, Mr. Chef/owner???",

We ate our meal with our coats on until we  finally asked a server if they would close the door. We were told they would TRY to keep it closed.  We wanted to have an after dinner drink and a dessert but decided not to stay because  we asked another server if they could please find our server.

The food simply was not good. The paella was completely unauthentic. It seemed like there was some sort of pre-made rice mix they used (with shriveled peas) and they just threw some seafood or meat in there. We took a couple of bites and couldn't bring ourselves to eat any more.My boyfriend even threw up after we got home. We were so excited that there was an authentic spanish restaurant in Arizona, but it was far from authentic. On the plus side,the tapas were better than the paella. I think that the best part of the meal BY FAR was the bread with some sort of garlic aioli dip. So, if you go here, stick with the bread and tapas and stay away from the main dishes.",

It was definitely a great price for a large group since we visited during happy hour and took advantage of Buy 1 Get 1 Free of anything on the menu.  I do have to say that the best part was the sangria and the cheesecake we brought with us. The atmosphere is good but it is somewhat small in size. The best tapas were the: manchego (you can't go wrong obviously), the shrimp, the meatballs and the chicken pieces. Our server suggested the ham and cheese croquettes which had neither ham nor cheese but potatoes instead. He was sure they were ham and cheese but the whole table wasn't convinced. The paella was good although the rice was a little overcooked in spots and our friend found a completely undercooked piece of chicken. We did send it back and they promptly brought us another portion. The dish was good but that was a little unnerving. I'm open to second chances and will probably give this a second chance just based on the sangria, the large menu  and the amazing happy hour deal!",

Crab-stuffed peppers: Also a favorite; it is a pepper stuffed with pimiento cheese and crab served over a saffron sauce, I believe. I would have ordered more of these if I could.  Manchego Cheese: It was just manchego cheese in an oil (maybe rosemary?) Not that impressive  Spicy Garlic Shrimp: Get this. Just do it.   Pork Tenderloin: Whatever sauce came on top of this is delicious. And the pork was cooked perfectly.  Adobo Beef: Also good, but just tastes like any other adobo beef.  Paella Valencia: This paella had mussels, clams, shrimp, chicken, peppers, onions and more. The flavors married well! If it's your first paella, get this one. I think I'll try the lobster and shrimp paella next time.  Mas Fi Rose Champagne - A little on the bitter side. If you're into bitter champagne, this is the one for you.",

That's a bit much. Our entrees were over priced for the small portions however, they were flavorful. We most likely won't return in the future.",

This is a beautiful restaurant, with sky high ceilings, offering dignified dining in Old Town Scottsdale. The patio space reminded me of a street in Europe. The food is exquisite.   In a heat beat I'd recommend every morsel that touched my lips. - Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic and white wine)  - Pimiento Piquillo con Centollo (peppers stuffed with crab)  - Patatas Aioli Verde (potatoes, cilantro, ham) - Pastel a la Porrusalda (leek tarte)  - Boquerones (anchovies in garlic)  I was \"eh\" on the flan. (Very eggy. Too much air involved.)  I had been very curious to sample the fare as this place is across from The Herb Box. With International Supper Club UYE here I gleefully perfused the menu. (Thank you very much for organizing Ursula!)  I'll probably never visit this restaurant again. EVEN THOUGH the food was spectacular. EVEN THOUGH the decor was wonderful. EVEN THOUGH they have live flamenco music and a happy hour.  Note: They would prefer if the check wasn't split. (Even for parties of five.) Come prepared to share wine menus. There appears to be an inexplicable shortage of these.",

We had made a reservation but there wasn't really anyone there around 3 pm in the afternoon, if that is what you are aiming for. We had come for two things and two things only: tapas and wine. I would say we ordered about $120 or so worth of tapas. We ordered the mushrooms in sherry and garlic sauce, the Patatas Bravas (spicy red potatoes), the Tortilla de Patatas (potato pie), cheese queso, and a bunch of other dishes I can't remember. The queso was the best thing at the top, really creamy, salty, and paired well with the rolls they provided. Highly recommend.   The spicy red potatoes were a close second, think thick wedges marinated in a spicy red sauce, however, very crispy at the same time. Each tapas is just about enough for two people at a time. Some dishes can be split between 4, like the potato pie and we also ordered an open faced empanada. The two most disappointing things were the sherry mushrooms and the mussels. The mushrooms did not have much flavor and were just warm in a butter sauce. The mussels were also lacking in flavor, so I wouldn't order those two again. Service was confusing at times, as the waiters were confused about who had our table. I would recommend ordering several tapas at a time, because it can get tedious having to constantly call the waiter over to order every time. So we ordered about 4 different tapas at a time, and they stayed hot and were enjoyed by all.",

After waiting another twenty minutes feeling abandoned and hungry, we left money for the two tapas that we did receive and then freed ourselves from the constructive imprisonment that was our experience.

The first impression was very good but things went downhill after that. We ordered a bunch of tapas - lamb, tuna and watermelon, mussels, roasted peppers, pork and potatoes. Except for the pork everything else was very good and an excellent start to the evening. Things went really south after that. We were more than halfway with our dinner and our drinks - 2 beers and a house margarita had still not arrived. Finally after reminding our server a couple of times our drinks showed up. The beer was lukewarm and the house margarita should be removed from the menu. The next round of tapas -- tenderloin, lamb meatballs and mini sausages were a disaster. Extremely salty and unappetizing. Not once did anyone come to clear our empty plates and ask about the food. This place gets one star because some of the food was good. Overall a very unpleasant experience and a total waste of money and evening!",

    "text": "I arrived expecting a great night here but due to the horrible Sangria and Paella, mediocre tapas, and lousy service, I left extremely disappointed.   I have walked by this place a few times before and seeing all the people on the patio enjoying the beautiful sunset and listing to the Flamenco music, it just seemed like a cool place. Unfortunately, we did not have reservations and so although the patio was complete empty when we arrived, we were told by the host (owner?) in a very condecending way that all the tables on the patio were reserved and so we would have to be seated inside. That dampened my spirits a little but I was still anticipating an enjoyable evening with my hubby and some good food. To start off, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share and some soup. Sangria arrived first in a surprisingly small pitcher. I could not believe that small pitcher was $22!  It turned out to be a good thing since it was so bad, neither one of us wanted to drink it. It was by far the worst Sangria I have ever had. It tasted like it was 1/2 cheap red wine and 1/2 club soda. Not sweet, not fruity. Instead of bright refreshing slices of citrus and other fruits there were a few bits of orange rind and a couple of pieces of some other fruit that had been diced so small it was unrecognizable. I ordered the gazpacho which was pretty good although I prefer it chunky rather than pureed and my husband got the seafood stew. That had a good flavor to it but the seafood in it was very overcooked.   We decided not to order any tapas with seafood in them after seeing the quality that was in the soup. We selected three Tapas to start with: the beef tenderloin, the leek tart, and the potato tortilla. The beef was pretty good, nothing special about it but it had a good flavor. The leek tart was not so great but the sauce it came with was delicious and we mopped it up with the bread in the bread basket. The tortilla was disappointing. To me this is the quintessential tapa dish so I was expecting it to be great but it was rubbery and tasteless as if it had been prepared hours earlier and then reheated. We had intended to start with only 3 tapas since we had already had the soup and told our waiter that we reserved the right to order more. He pressured us into ordering some paella as well so we did. Now I absolutely love paella, it is truly one of my favorite dishes on earth but since other Yelp reviewers had said to stay away from it I ordered it with some misgivings.   The paella arrived about 20 minutes after we had finished the rest of our meal. Our waiter did warn us that it took a while to prepare but I was not expecting it to take that long. As soon as we tried it, I realized that it was not worth the wait. As other reviewers have mentioned it was way too watery and very bland tasting. In addition, the vegetables tasted like they came from a bag in the freezer section. And the seafood was the same rubbery stuff that was in the soup. The rings of calamari were so tough, you could not cut them with a fork, I had to use a serrated knife. The shrimp had lost all of its sweet flavor and was just as tough. The entire dish was so awful that we didn't even finish it.   So, they were already down two stars for the horrible Sangria and Paella... Also while waiting for the Paella, I visited the ladies room which although beautifully decorated was filthy. Dirty restaurant bathrooms are a personal pet-peeve of mine so that had knocked them down a star as well. Also, the cheesy outfits the servers wear and the overall poor service (we were brought the wrong dishes initially and had to ask repeatedly for plates since we were sharing) had knocked them down another star. The final straw was that as we were leaving I counted four empty tables on the patio that we could have been seated at.  Overall, just a horrible experience.  I strongly recommend staying away from this place.",

    "text": "I was living in Phoenix for a few months and my family was coming to visit so I needed to find a place to take them out. We ate at a different restaurant in Scottsdale, followed by a stroll along the street when we heard some beautiful flamenco music which is what drew us in. We had a few drinks and enjoyed the live flamenco band so much that we ended up making reservations for dinner the very next night.   Our dinner there was amazing! I had never had tapas before and neither had my family but we loved every bit of it! Their menu is wonderful with a great variety of tapas (small plates), and main courses. The service was outstanding. I forget out waiter's name but he was serving us the night before when we came for drinks and came in the next day on his day off to serve us dinner! The chef even came out towards the end of our meal to talk to us. He explained how most of the ingredients are flown in fresh from Spain. And wow what a difference!  All in all, would definitely recommend this place for couples looking for a lovely date night and groups of friends looking to eat, drink, and be merry!",

The food was amazing (I'm writing this as I'm eating leftover Paella). The service was fantastic and the live Flamenco music really set a fun tone for the party. I hear there are live Flamenco dancers there too on certain nights. Would highly recommend. It will be one of our regular places. Not often I give perfect stars, but this place is deserving.",

    "text": "I love reading the reviews on Yelp but always told myself that it was going to take an unbelievable experience to write a review.  This was my first experience in a Tapas Restaurant but boy was I extremely impressed.  The atmosphere was absolutely brilliant, and I even felt that I was dining in a different country.   We walked in without reservations but were treated like we were regulars by the general manager.  We sat at the bar and ordered drinks while we waited.  I am normally a vodka drinker, but the bartender told us we had to try their Sangria.  I can tell you this: It was so worth going out of my comfort level, and I realized that maybe I should listen to the experts more often.    Our wait time was only half the time we were supposed to wait.  We sat down and were entertained with the Flamenco dancers.  When the food got to the table it was out of this world.  We tried things that I never thought to eat in my entire life along with other delicacies.  The owner Joseph came over to introduce himself and it felt like he actually cared that we were dining in his restaurant.  In today's dining very rarely do you ever have the owner conversing with the patrons and making them feel at home.  Best of all, he sent complimentary champagne over because we were dining for a special event.  This great experience led me to schedule my 30th birthday party at the venue.",

    "text": "As an aficionado of Spanish cuisine, I came in hoping to be, at the least, semi-blown, but resulted in a half satisfied appetite.  The biggest draw for me was the seemingly endless count of Tapas, at least a dozen in each category: Seafood, Meat, Vegetables/Cheese.  I always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these \"exotic\" ingredients.  In my humble book, I tend to base my Spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious Paella!  For me, this is a deal breaker!  The pricing was fair and reasonable, but the quality fell quite short! The classic Valencia was simply, too watery! History tells me it should be fluffier, creamier and rich in flavor! On the other hand, the Arros Negre, was more pleasing and entertaining! If you never had squid ink in the paella form, it is a safe try!  The only caveat is it temporarily leaves black marks around your lips, teeth, and tongue.  The list of Tapas we tried included:  ** the best and recommended  - The Spanish Potato Pie: was not as soft and fluffy as I imagined, parts of it were choppy, mediocre taste.  - Mushrooms with Garlic and Sherry: very average, nothing too special here.  ** Rabbit Stew with Bread Sauce: for the first time trying this, it was actually pretty good, tasted like Chicken!  the meat was tender with a rich flavored stew!  ** Braised Oxtail in Paprika Sauce: pleasantly pulled off the bone good!  - Lamb Chops: thought it was somewhat dry, thus not as juicy as I had hoped for.  2 or 3 pieces, I believe.  - Calamari Rings: the batter was light and cooked perfectly, accompanied by three different sauces, that I cannot recall the names to, but nonetheless, tasty.  - Snails: average, nothing to spectacular.  The pitcher of Sangria was too small for my usual liking, it filled just 4 small glasses and lacked the wine taste.  What I liked the most was the atmosphere--live music created a fun mood and the rich detail of the Spanish-esque decor to bring everything together.  Since I was here for my birthday, they did bring out a complimentary flan that I thought tasted a little eggy? The cool part was partaking in a Spanish tradition where the server shoots a long stream of wine into your mouth.    Overall, the experience here was just average with mediocre flavors among the Tapas with some exceptions, thus, I would only return for the Squid Ink Paella, Rabbit Stew, and Braised Oxtail.",

The paella was skillfully prepared with great tasting perfectly cooked rice, authentic chorizo chunks, large pieces of shrimp and chicken all seasoned expertly in a great tasting sauce.  The Sangria had a fresh, satisfying taste, but we thought was exorbitantly priced, at $30 for a small pitcher.  As good as the food is, I'd have to say our meal was over priced, totaling more than $70 per person.  In this price level, I'd have to say there are much better options in the area, unless the group is dead-set on Spanish food.",

I happened to spot this place last week when walking around old town last weekend and it looked so lively and I love Spanish food so we made the trip last night. It was fairly busy when we arrived around 915pm and we were created my an older gentlemen in a t shirt and apron.. he was very welcoming and enthusiastic! He sat us on their lovely patio right where we had a perfect view of the flamenco dancers and live guitarist.   Our waiter took quite a long time to greet us but the busser came out with menus and water. Then our waiter came and got our drink order but kept us waiting a long time. One thing about this place is service is slow and that's how they do it there so expect it.   While we were waiting the older gentlemen came back to make sure we had ordered or been helped. We explained we hadn't put our order in yet, but was not a big deal since we were watching the show. He then introduced himself as Joseph the owner and head chef! Then the real experience started! He told us about his menu and everything sounded so good so we decided to let him order for us.  Everything was absolutely fantastic! We started with bread and garlic aoli, the garlic shrimp so delicious. As we were waiting Joseph was having a down to earth conversation with us telling us about his family, showing us his kids, telling us about spain and his life there. He was a real delight to speak with and was so humble. He was showing us his garden right next the patio where most of their ingredients from. He grows apples, figs, peppers, tomatos, cauliflower, pumpkin, squash, cilantro, basil, and a lot more stuff I can't remember. He uses no pesticides or chemicals. Now I was impressed and hadn't even eaten but one dish yet!   Then the waiter started bringing out out the rest of the food, crab stuffed peppers, lamb chops, beef tenderloin, bacon wrapped goat cheese dates, manchego cheese, then paella which was to die for!  Everything was finger licking good! After we finished dinner Joseph came over again and brought us some dessert which was plaintains with pistachio ice cream smothered in liquor 43 which was so good, dessert shots on the house, and even had our wine taken off our bill. I thought this was so nice of him and was completely unexpected!   In all this place is divine and we were made to feel like family which is above beyond most places. We will definitely be back and will bring our friends and family! This place is a gem and if your looking for an experience this is the place!",

We then mixed up what we got on the second course.  Everything was awesome.  There were two desserts on the menu for restaurant week and so we split those up as well.

The six of us enjoyed the chef's menu and it's the best idea if you're if you're new to Spanish food.  We couldn't have enjoyed it more.  The food was spectacular, the entertainment was out of this world, so much fun and our waiter Arturo had just the right amount of attitude for us.  We enjoyed our experience so very much that we went back the next day!  I recommend this restaurant very highly it's a lot of fun.",

    "text": "Went here on a recommendation as I had a gathering of a large group (8). We were very excited to find a Tapas place. It has been several days since my visit and I am still shocked in the experience. The service was bad, we had to ask for someone the help us as our server was also the bartender. When it came time to order the server kept pushing to do the chef special, when we tried to only order a couple of those place and expand the server insisted we wanted to all get the same thing. Needless to say we we with ordering on our own. I personally had the beef tenderloin, bacon wrapped dates, and garlic chicken. I am thankful they finally brought us bread as I ended up needing that to fill my stomach. I couldn't finish the 2 pieces of meat as it was not good, 2 others tried to help as another person also ordered and they felt that same way. The chicken was ok but nothing to write home about. 2 people ordered some kind of hot dish, they got their food 20 yes 20 minutes after we all received ours. A few of us were kicking ourselves for not just leaving and going down to Bario Queen.  If this place plans to stay around they need to step up their game, there are WAY too many places to eat in AZ.",

    "text": "The restaurant itself is located in a picturesque location and has lovely ambiance. There are Miro-like paintings decorating the walls and in the evenings there is live guitar music.   We ordered an array of tapas (Typically around $6-10 per order) and the Paella Valenciana (About $20 per person). I enjoyed the cured meats (Chorizo, jamon Serrano), the potato dish (Tortilla de Patatas), and the garlic chicken (Pollo a la Cazadora). The clam and asparagus tapas we ordered (Txirlas a la Koskera) had a light sauce but there was a considerable amount of grit in some clams that we ate. One had so much grit I could hear the crunch when my friend chewed! The white asparagus was tender but very vinegary in stark contrast to the very light tasting sauce.  The paella was beautifully presented and had some of the flavor of a typical paella, but I wasn't impressed with the actual execution. It was served in a paella pan, but the rice was all the same texture and had a lot of liquid in it. It didn't have any of the socarrat, i.e., the caramelized crispy rice on the bottom that paellas typically have. Since there were clams in it apparently the grit from the clams dispersed itself into the sauce because there were some bites where I felt like I was eating sandy rice. As with the clam tapas dish, quite a few of the clams I chewed on had a substantial amount of sand in it (So much that I had to spit some of them out). The rest of the seafood was unremarkable, as the shrimp was overcooked and tough, and the mussels were mushy tasting.   The best parts of the paella were the small Spanish sausage chunks in it (Txistorra sausage). It had a piquant bold taste that was unique and went great with the rice.  Dessert was one of the highlights of the meal. We shared some churros, apple-banana bread pudding (Pastel de Pan, $6), and a special coconut ice cream in a young coconut shell ($12). The churros had a crispy shell with a molten creamy center, and was served with a dark chocolate dip. The bread pudding was decent, but the caramelized sauce of the pudding masked a lot of the taste of banana or apple. The coconut ice cream was probably my favorite dessert, as it was rich, creamy, and a very sizable portion to share.  Although the ambiance can't be beat, I'm not sure I'd come here again for paella or for any of their seafood. I would possibly come here again for some tapas and/or dessert.",

Lots of empty tables especially on the patio where we sat.  The ambience is great in this restaurant.  Nice patio and nice decorations.  Service was very friendly but waited for the food longer than usual, which was fine, since we wanted to take our time also on New Years Eve. The most disappointing to me where the small portions and high prices for the small size portions!!!  We had not been to Tapas Papa Fritas for over a year and I was shocked how the portion size had shrunk.  The tapas were a huge disappointment in comparison to what they used to be. Knowing this now I might not be back to this place despite the beautiful location & ambience. Tapas where too expensive for the small portions.",

The taste is non existent. Very bland. We ordered the Patatas, the croquetas and meatballs. The meatballs looked like, and tasted like they were bought from the frozen section, and some tomatoe soup was added. On top of that, the portions were not that big. Real tapas in Spain are meant to be shared. 3 croquetas for 8 dollars is insane. So to sum it all up, the ambience was good. They had a flamenco dancer, nice beautiful bar, and great service. The food is the biggest let down. It was bland, heavily overpriced, and under portioned. It is not what tapas are about.",

She came ask us for a drink and treat us like we didn't know the menu she had another party next to us and she was very polite told them their specials and she was very nice to them we order and she took the order brought us the food didn't say enjoy or nothing just drop the food and left  ( never came back to see how we are doing ) the hostess was very nice a young guy probably 16 or 17 years old brought us bread and smile all the time . But the waitress was not what I will want in my restaurant her name was Raquel and I work as a server and I know how to treat people what makes me mad the she is hispanic like my self and she is racist or I don't know what her deal was but made my Mother's Day the works day for my mom . I been suggesting this place to allot of people cause I like the food but today I was very disappointed and tell my Hispanic friends and  costumers  don't go to this Spanish racist restaurant",

Food- sadly very bland and underwhelming  Very disappointed, lived in Spain for 3 years and this food was the food you would buy frozen at Carrefour (European Walmart)and cook at home, nothing special and cheap. I didn't even want to go down the Paella route. Was not going to waste money being disappointed with ordering it when the easiest tapas to make that we ordered were sadly disappointing. Rabas-must have the same supplier as Olive Garden see below for rabas de verdad de Santander... Albondigas - tasted like the frozen meatballs from Sam's club. Croquettes- no flavor, pretty much tasted like bechamel  was the only filling.  Pollo al ajillo - no flavor. So sad I had high hopes but I will never be back.",

We came here to celebrate our birthdays and left p*ssed off and annoyed.  Absolute cr*p service throughout the dinner.  I had people bumping into my chair as well, which made the night even worst.  Waiters were arguing all night, dishes were being thrown around, must of heard at least 5 times where dishes were being cracked and smashed.  Here's a sample how the night was.  Waiter was no where to be seen, took us half an hour just to get the menu's.  Finally a female, (might of been the manager) comes over and apologizes over and over, finally our waiter came over. She asked him, have you read the specials yet?  He replied No, and she told him to go ahead and name the specials, it was clear, he was agitated and when she left, he didn't even read them off!  Very awkward, I looked at my wife and just gasped...Holy sh*t we are going to be in for a while ride.  I don't blame our waiter, he looked flustered and overwhelmed all night.  Actually everybody did, the service was so bad that they kept on apologizing and offered a bottle of champagne for their incompetence.  Regardless, when the 1st course would come out, half of the party never got what they requested and some didn't even get their food.  When entree's came out, my wife and I didn't even get ours and by the time we did, our party had already finished their meals.  Complete chaos.  I looked in the kitchen and looked like they had two dudes working.  My wife and I come from families that own restaurants, and we completely felt sorry for the wait staff and how poorly they are at their jobs.  At least hire people that \"pretend\" to care, you're better off getting better customer service at Walmart.  Our bill came out to 585.00 and half of us were still hungry and talked about hitting up In and Out afterwards.    I'm not even going to talk about the food, not worth my time.  As I walked out of the restaurant, I ended up throwing the leftovers away in the trash.  I want to completely erase this place from my memory.  I will not go to this place ever again.  NEXT!",

I had my special needs brother with me and he came out immediately to make sure he was comfortable and able to see the flamingo dancer from his seat. But even more above and beyond, we had not ordered him a meal, he was just going to eat a little off our plates but chef Joseph brought out chicken fingers and French fries for him.

Poor service, waiter vanished and never put all our orders in. Nor did he check on us but once the entire evening. Terrible owner. Went there for my girlfriends birthday. Must have told them 15 times it was her special \"50\" and instead of being treated like the awesome person that she is,  the ugly owner and his nose ended up yelling at HER!( for no reason in my honest opinion)!  Telling her that she is \"hard to please\". Simply because she asked him why there were no flamenco dancers there at 7:30 when that is what is advertised by the establishment. Unbelievable. Oh ya the bathrooms were out of soap and there was vomit all over the floor. So if your looking to ruin the romance.. Head on down there!",

The patio area is very intimate with a great ambiance, even if seated next to super obnoxious drunk tourists who pronounce tapas as \"taay-puhs\".  This has been our go to for special occasions such as an anniversary or New Year's Eve. But it's also a great pick me up for a weekday when a craving for sangria strikes. Either way we get great service every time. It's definitely an experience, one that continues to surprise with something exciting or undiscovered every visit. Even the bread and garlic aioli is incredible. Gambas al ajillo is another favorite. I have a garlic addiction, what can I say?  As an AZ native, the thought of fancying up a canal and calling it the \"waterfront\" is hilarious. But the patio does have a really relaxing vibe next to the water and you can forget for a moment that a canal isn't terribly exciting.",

I strongly have to agree with other recent reviewers that the service and management of this place needs a serious overhaul.    Our service was very impersonal.  The hostess was indifferent when we arrived - barely acknowledging us when we walked into the door and struggling to even smile.  We came well before classic Scottsdale rush hour and the restaurant was not even 50% full.    Our service was so slow.  Our waitress had very few tables and barely paid attention to us sometimes disappearing for 30-45 minutes at a time.  As an example, it took us 30 minutes for us to get our desert after they cleared our dinner plates.  She never offered coffee or after dinner drinks.  Our waitress disappeared during the whole time.    We had to ask a bus boy for help.    Our food was average at best including very bland rice dishes and to have that at a Spanish restaurant!?! Come on.  Save your money and try somewhere else nearby.  This area definitely has better restaurants to offer.",

    "text": "It's been a long time since I've eaten tapas, because I generally like big portions, but I was a guest so I figured, \"what the heck.\" The atmosphere was buzzing.  It was crowded but my cousin had the forethought to make reservations, so they sat our party right away. This was the most interesting place I have been to in a long time. They had a menu with tapas and meals. Tapas are like tasting-size portions. Now, they also had a chef's special menu. The special was 5 or 6 different tapas, then a meal, and a digestive (I haven't drank alcohol in 10 years, but it smelled like port.. Of course I looked at the price for the special and it was $45 per person.  I thought. \"Is it New Year's Eve and I've become senile?\" But every special was enough for two people, so it wasn't New Year's Eve. My cousins had shared vegetarian tapas, and I split a regular one with the only other non-kosher family member. My tapas were a small lamb chop, shrimp scampi, a fig wrapped in bacon, a skewer of beef, some cherry tomatoes, and a pepper stuffed with goat cheese. Everything was good. The meal was paella served on a skillet. The portion was larger than I expected, and the authenticity was there. But the thing that really stood out, was the service. Our waiter was in the top five waiters that I've had in my life. He could teach a class on how to be a waiter. Helpful without being obtrusive, smiling, good energy level, happy to explain everything, the works. He also gave us six free ports, which was very generous. I can honestly say that it was worth the price, and I don't say that too often when it's more that $30 per person. When I visit Scottsdale again, I'm sure that we'll go there.",

    "text": "Overpriced American food in Spanish dress with an occasional up sell. I found this place to be mediocre at best (speaking of the food, lackluster service aside). Maybe if we got entertainment it would be worth the price. The aceitunas seem like like grocery store olives ($7) with some herbs on them (the same sauce they put on a bunch of other dishes). Patatas bravas are wedge fries with sauce on them. Having been in Spain, absolutely nothing here tastes authentic. Even the manchego felt like they may have picked it up at trader joes was overpriced and came with an up-sell to a bigger cheese plate.",

Very filling but not too much food. It was all kind of rich as well so don't go in expecting many low calorie options. The service was great and the flamenco was really cool for the atmosphere.",

No thanks, I'll pay $20 for paella for the table and get individual tapas for each person. \"Well the $20 paella usually serves just 1\" he said. Well I'll be the judge of that.

    "text": "Although having vaguely heard of Tapas Papa Fritas, and a connoisseur of excellent Spanish Cuisine - I didn't pay much attention to this eatery, I am very astonished to say, because of its name - Fried Potato Snacks!  Boy was I wrong!  Being of Spanish heritage, I was flabbergasted with Tapas Papa Fritas' traditional atmosphere, an atmosphere emitting Basque, Andalusian, Moorish, Castilian and Asturian regions feel, decor and food!  This appealing and large eatery smacks of being in Spain!  From being almost obscure in its external surroundings, once you step up the path to the front door, past the traditional-style plant-filled veranda, see their fabulous outdoor seating area, you have arrived to the old world of Espana!  Having grown up in a Spanish-Cuban atmosphere, I am well versed in the fare offerings, what I should anticipate both traditionally and in any nouveau prospects.  I was impressed and satisfied!  While absorbing the atmosphere, we were seated near a window whereby we had the opportunity to admire both the inside and outside, as we experienced a fine bottle of Pinetti Notte Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie 2014.  My wife and I were pleased to see some of the old-world as well as fine-dining traditions followed by our Server, Sina who showed his expertise in not only fine proper serving, but old-world rapport, pleasantry and knowledge.  Elegant service from table cloths, silverware and the use of an enoteca for wine.  As newcomers to the establishment, we decided to try something that would give us the widest array of samplings, so we started with their Tapas Deluxe Special which included: Gambas al Pil-Pil, Chorizo, Txistorra, Stuffed Dates, Queso Manchego, Chicken Skewer, and a Lamb Shank - all prepared and served to perfection.  And, just as is in the Old World, no rush... patience, enjoyment and privacy abound.  We then went for the main course.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed (I did too) her serving of Paella Valenciana in a traditional style with saffron rice, fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, tender chicken, extraordinary txistorra, peppers, onions, tomatoes and peas - beyond delectable it was!  I proceeded to have their incredible rendition of Conejo (Rabbit) Romescu Catalan-style, with a soft to the palate peppery tomato almond sauce over an excellent rendition of traditional saffron rice.  If you enjoy rabbit as I do, this dish is for you - amazing!  I believe it needless to say, by the end of our meal, we had no room for dessert of which they have a wonderful assortment of Spanish selections.  It is no wonder why this eatery has received the accolades it has on media, from critics and awards alike -the food, the atmosphere, the staff, the accoutrements and the vibe are magnificent.  Our profound kudos to Chef Joseph Gutierrez and his incredible art.  As unfortunately so many 'Traditional' Spanish in the Valley and across the country tend to do, sway to changing the great things which don't need changing from our past - the only nouveau here is the first time patron.  We look forward to visiting them as frequently as possible to get our taste buds wrapped around more of their fabulously authentic cuisine, Flamenco shows and live Latin music during the weekends.  Can't wait for the next visit.  Excellent ambience, service, hospitality and food - next time I'm going for my favorite: Zarzuela (Seafood Stew - some may know it as Spanish-style Bouillabaisse)!  Bon appetit!",

Fortunately, my friends were smarter & left me some breadcrumbs to find them there.  Speaking of bread, it's ok but the garlic aioli sauce is more than ok. Do ask for it. It goes well with...the bread ;)  I got the entree, sole dipped in egg. Amen. That's all I can say. Always nervous ordering seafood in Arizona. This was great. Very fresh.  My friends did the tapas thing. I tried their croquettes de Jamon. They were good but we didn't find any Jamon in there.  The waiter was from Spain. What a refreshing change of pace. I speak a little Spanish & had a blast trying to converse.  There was a bit of live flamenco, but my eye was more distracted by the flat screen showing the NBA Finals :D  Bring some friends, try a bunch of stuff. I think you'll enjoy it.",

We obliged just to be told by someone else that they were indeed closed to the public and were not allowed to dine anywhere, including their very empty patio.

In addition to the Chef menu we ordered 2 of the special prosciutto dishes one a standard and the second from a walnut fed pig. I'm not a big prosciutto fan but these were outstanding! The walnut fed was exceptionally pricy at 30.00 for the app! Be forewarned this was a bit of a surprise to me.   The service was excellent! The waiter was fun engaged and did a very good job. The bus staff did not speak much English.   Nice wine list, bone up on Spanish wines as they make up a large portion of the wine list.   Bottom line we will go back!

Stuffed squid: thumb size -room temperature - one piece - nothing taste specail Crab Stuffed in peper: thumb size - two piece - room temperature- real crab meat but can't taste the fresh, and texture like mesh potato in pepper... Escargots: a nickle size - about 8 pieces - it is hot - taste olive oil and garlic - it is alright - something can't eat everywhere Lamb rack: 2 pieces, cooked medium well, tender, 3/16\" thick, 1\"x2\" of meat, warm, - worth to order it Ox tail: one medium size of ox tail (as big as 1 yrs old baby's hand), $8?? I believe it is pre-cooked, the outside is warm, the inside is less then room temperature, I really want to ask the waiter to take the ox tail, put in back to the microware to re-heat for another minutes..but the food just too small...just eat and swallow...(don't try to complain, the waiter always not around).

Nick took wonderful care of us from the moment I called to make the reservation.  He personally chose a selection of tapas and paella for our group of 6 based on the things we told him we liked and not a single dish disappointed!  Favorites include the lamb chops, the filet skewers, cheese-stuffed portobellos and bacon/cheese empenadas.  The seafood paella was also incredible!  I also highly recommend the sangria, both the traditional and the white.  Nick comped all the birthday boy's drinks which was a very thoughtful gesture and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine selection.  We were there for dinner, but we will definitely be back again soon for happy hour... 3-6pm every day and the entire menu and sangria are 50% off!

The third , Paella. I even went so far as to tell the server that we were not in a hurry and to not send out the paella as we wanted to enjoy the wine. They brought out the food as soon as I asked them to begin making it.  It was most likely sitting around for a while. Unfortunately when it arrived it was not hot and over cooked.

I have been here three times now (twice for dinner and once for dessert and coffee) and I can say with certainty that this is the best Tapas restaurant in America (that I've been to, anyways). I live in Chicago and have been to countless mediocre tapas joints here, in Miami, throughout the Midwest, NYC, but nothing compares to Papas Fritas. First, the restaurant. Gorgeous, lit like a Sofia Coppola film at sunset. Most beautiful patio I've ever dined on. The service, always been good even one night that was crazy busy they kept our plates coming. Food: wonderful with a belt-busting selection of plates. They even do live Flamenco!!! I have had some horrendous experiences in Scottsdale and elsewhere in the valley (I'm looking at you Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers) especially so I don't want to be one of those jerks that only reviews things when I want to complain. Anyways I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale for some warmth for the winter and some tapas.",

    "text": "The food here is very good.  All of the tapas appear to be good.  Got several and enjoyed them with my wife, and father.  I was at this place last night.  I still miss Iruna's, as it is closed for remodeling.  I would have gone to Iruna's if they were open.    My wife said that the food at Tapas Papa Frita was good, but like me, she wishes Iruna's would hurry up and complete their remodeling, as she likes the food better there.",

What they consider happy hour prices is much more expensive what I consider happy hour prices. However, the food is good, and the service is good. They even have a doggy area for people like me who like to take their dog with them. It is very expensive, but it is a nice treat.",
