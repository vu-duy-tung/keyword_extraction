    "text": "Have been a LOYAL Zeeks customer since we tried this place months ago. We eat out here at least once to twice per month and  tonight they just lost one of their loyal customers. We buy the entertainment books once a year to get discounts on eating out since we do it so often. We buy two at a time and we were told by the female owner that we could use our coupons at one time since we buy 2 books a year at the same time as long as we do separate orders. MIND YOU WE ONLY DO THIS ONCE A YEAR !  So tonight while my wife and I were at Chandler Fashion Place she called and placed one order and immediately called back to do the second order and was then placed on hold for over 10 minutes.   We ended up driving while still on hold from Chandler Fashion Center to the zzeeks location and walked in and ask to speak with the supervisor. We spoke to Mark who immediately looked at his phone and said no one was on hold so then we put the phone on speaker so he could hear that we were still on hold and brushed it off so nonchalantly like it was no big deal!   Then decided to give us trouble about using our coupons. Not ONE APOLOGY! Our order was done by the time we got there so then we had to wait an additional 25 minutes for a 2nd order to be placed while our first order got cold. We walked out very disappointed since this was a great place but customer service like that is just unacceptable! With this being said Jody the owner of Zzeeks has contacted me. I am so grateful to her for her sincerity. Thank you Jody, you get your  back.",

We called ahead to make sure they had slices ready to serve and we got there and it took 30 mins to get our food after our order keep in mind our lunch break is only 30 mins so we pretty much had to rush back and eat on the go. The pizza was really awesome but that's the other reason it got two stars. The workers there looked confused and there was no work flow. Take notes from Barro's how they have their pizza ready for their customer. This place will never be successful during a lunch hour.",

It might be a bit better.  While the beer was served cold, the pizza tasted like a microwaved lunchable. Toppings were over cooked, the cheese was rubbery and flavorless.   It says a lot about a place when a ten year old is in the back prepping food.   Sorry Zzeeks why don't you try again.",

We get a amazing yummy zesty pizza and share out latest essential oils. The staff is super friendly and accomedating to our large group, even letting us taste test the sauces from the kitchen! :) if all that wasnt enough, the owner knows us 411 folks and often slips us an extra small pie to take home, which is great for when we get hungry during our \"Save the Lakes\" meetings! Overall i love mmzesty zzeeks and my mouth cant wait to go back for another slice!",

    "text": "I eat here often because their pizza is delicious! It may sound boring to some, but plain cheese pizza is usually my go-to. Theirs is amazing! The crust is a cross between chewy and doughy, and the cheese is super stringy and they top it off with herbs. I'm a real stickler about sauce, but Zzeeks' sauce isn't too bitter, acidic or generic. Each pizza I've had from there tastes like everything is homemade, like it's made from scratch.  If ordering in at the restaurant, be aware that they sometimes have Karaoke nights. (Last time I ordered for pick up, it was kind of loud because of a group of 11 year olds singing their heart out to Katy Perry haha.) But if Karaoke is your thing, then this might be even more of a reason to come here.  You will not regret eating here. They are always having killer deals, sell delicious pizza and wings and have a friendly atmosphere and workers. I suggest you try their mac-n-cheese bites with their ranch sauce. But be careful, they are extremely addicting!",

She knew it was our first time so she gave us a whole pizza so we could take some home. Great food! I was sad to have moved too far away from my favorite place in Gilbert, but Zzeeks really filled the void for us.

    "text": "We discovered Zzeeks about two weeks ago and have visited four times since. We've loved everything we tried and the friendly staff have always been helpful.   The pizza is incredible. Real hand tossed crust with real toppings. For example, if you order bacon, you get real breakfast bacon crumbled on your pizza. Their dough has the perfectly thin blend of chewy, doughy crunch. The sauce is flavorful yet not overpowering.   Their wings are crisp and meaty with  great sauce variety. Don't miss 50  cent wings all day Sunday. Two people can split a drink, a 12\" pizza and a dozen wings easily for a very budget conscious total.   We haven't tried any of the sandwiches or calzones yet, but those are next on our list. What we've seen go past to other tables looks good.  One thing is for sure, these folks aren't playing around, the calzones look big enough to sink a ship. And the 20\" pizza provides plenty of the best cold pizza leftovers we've ever had.   They do run great specials including giant single slice deals. Friday is karaoke night that's apparently very popular with kids. So, finding a table can be a challenge. However, any other night (that we've been anyway), you'll find that little neighborhood pizza joint that blows the chain pizza places out of the water.    I joined Yelp because of Zzeeks.",

The breadstick bites were alright.  They seemed a little on the burnt side but had good garlic flavor.  I'm glad the marinara served with them was warm and not cold.   The wings had almost no sauce on them at all and just looked like some boneless wings you'd buy at the grocery store.   And the ranch that came with had a really sour, nasty taste to it.  I passed on eating the wings.  The pizza was just okay also.  It, too, seemed almost burnt.  The pizza probably could have come out of the oven a few minutes earlier and it would have been perfect.  Since it was over cooked, I could only eat one slice cause it seemed really dry.  The flavor wasn't bad however.  Over all I don't think I'll be back.  It just wasn't good enough for me to want to give it a second shot.  And it definitley wasn't worth the $40 I spent on all of this food.",

I always get the extreme pepperoni pizza because it's really good. It has all kinds of different pepperoni. I also like that they have Pepsi instead of Coke.",

Delivery guy was super nice and so was the person who took the order. However, for $46. not including tip not worth it.",

My meatball sub was more than one person can possibly consume. I think there were 10 meatballs on it and the sauce came separate so I could sauce according to my liking.   The pizza which I call a supreme had tons of fresh toppings and comes on a light and airy crust that's crunchy too....I could eat it all day long.   Bonus....if you haven't tried an Eegee, make sure you do. Lemon/strawberry combo is delicious.   There's nothing about this order to go that I didn't like. It's a bit warm in the restaurant for me but I wasn't staying.",

The pie was soggy in the middle and sauce was bland. The wings were actually good and flavour was nice. The first girl that helped me was really rude and seemed irritated that I was there. However, the second girl that brought my order was really friendly and accommodating.  Items were a little overpriced for what you get and you'd probably get more, bang-for-your-buck going to Papa Murphy's and wings at Safeway for your evening dinner.  If you love gambling and wanna try a crap shoot, get a pie here.",

The salad I hit with it had fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and olives.. I was expecting the usual old semi decent salad but I'm actually looking forward to reading this salad. I will be ordering from here again.

This space has been a few places since Sammy B's and has not had a decent slice since their departure. We ordered nachos, boneless wings and a large pizza all for under $30 with drinks. Without the coupon that alone would not make this worth it.   Our nachos arrived and were nothing special, the cheese was shredded and melted on instead of a more liquid cheese and the jalapenos were good but not as much heat as I would have liked. The wings were very good but reminded me of the Anytyzers you can pick up at the supermarket and make yourself. The pizza was decent but I was pretty much full by the time it came out. It wasn't too greasy but there was nothing about it that wowed me.    The staff is very friendly, it appeared to be family run and I always try to support family businesses over chains. I would come back, just not without a coupon.",

I get it delivered and it is always timely and looks like it was made with care and consideration, not just thrown together and tossed in the delivery bag. If you are looking for pizza variety that is well made, then go Zzeeks!",

The best thing about this pizzeria is that you can see your food being prepared. The kids love watching their pizza being made. I love seeing the clean environment in which my food is being prepared. This is a welcomed change from the typical greasy kitchen hidden by a swinging door that most pizzerias have.   Every time I've eaten there, the owner comes to personally great us and make sure everything was satisfactory. They are very customer service oriented. We walked in the first time as customers, but felt like we left as friends.  The pizza has a zesty, tastey sauce, and the crust is crisp on the outside, softer in the middle probably as close as you can get to New York style out here. The sausage is very fresh and probably the best I've tasted. I love the buffalo chicken sandwich. They add bacon which surprisingly brings out the taste of the buffalo chicken breast. They have delicious bread sticks which are more like bread bites. This is one of the few places in the valley that offers zeppoles!",

I had never had their wings, so when I asked about the different spice levels they were more than happy to explain the different \"tiers\" of spice they had and let me sample the different flavors. Their suicide spice was the first I've had in the area that actually challenged my taste buds. Apparently they have hotter flavors, but I haven't had them yet.   As a side note, the person I initially dealt with was clearly a trainee as he had to ask someone else if he could give samples. But what stood out was that the other employees were very willing to assist him. While this doesn't have a direct impact on me as a consumer, I feel that it speaks to the culture of the place.   Their pizza was also very good. I've only had one type, but I'd say it is still within the top 10% of pizzas I've tried in the Phoenix area. I will definitely be visiting this place again soon.",

    "text": "I'm not a fan: we have given them three tries ordering through Eat24 - even though we hated the pizza back in February - and yesterday out of an order of $46+, only the boneless wings and salad were edible.   The Chicken Philly had less than 3oz of tiny, cubed chicken, hardly any cheese, and was on burnt bread; the entire sandwich took on the scorched flavor. Scott's meatball parmigiana sando had little to no mozzarella (subbed out for provolone on menu) on stale garlic bread with no marinara, and oddly, sauteed mushrooms?! I hate wasting food, but mine went into the trash, Scott was starving and ate his.   Jody the owner was prompt to offer to replace the sandwiches, and is very nice; I declined. However, since we've had 2/3 experiences with inedible food, including items we had before which were now bad, we will not order again. I'm not a person who accepts free food, or invites from management to \"come back in and we will make it better\" instead, we revisit anonymously to have an average customer experience.   Being community minded volunteers ourselves, we commend this location for their involvement in charitable endeavors, but consistency, pride in what the kitchen sends out, and good, edible product is paramount in the food service industry.   We wish them well, and hope everyone who enjoys their food, keeps supporting them. I'm done.",

Avoiding confrontation on how absolutely rude he was being we just went with the basic honey barbecue. We ordered about 25 minutes before arriving to pick up and had to wait an additional 15-20 for them to be ready. We got home to open the box to the TINIEST wings I've seen in my life. I called immediately and spoke with the manager Jody who apologized profusely explaining it was one of their busiest nights and they'd had size issue with the shipment from the vendor and the cook was supposed to add extra wings to make up for the issue and forgot. She was nice and created an account for us to get 10 free wings on our next visit. Four stars because they have eegee and she was helpful and kind without me having to even get uspet about the issue. Will update once we see if there is a change in the wing quality but the pizza we've had before and isn't good either. This may become just an eegees stop for us ",

If they're going to make honey barbecue it shouldn't be, bring the nuggets and the honey barbecue sauce on the side it should be prepared as honey barbecue wings. The pizza was OK. The spaghetti was cold when brought out. My son never got his pizza but was payed for. The customer service wasn't that great, however, that didn't change the fact that we felt like we had food poisoning for the rest of the night and couldn't sleep because of it. I hope that the cooking portion of this restaurant gets it together which is the most important asset to their business. They kept on getting the orders wrong. Unfortunately the food quality was not good all together. Flavor not good temperature not good. Would not recommend this place to anyone",

Since I love pizza, and the criticisms I provided in my earlier review were minor and easily correctable, it was an easy decision to give them another chance.  First, let me say that Jody was very friendly and assured me that she had spoken to her staff about my experience. It is obvious that she cares deeply about the business and her customers. She made me a small pepperoni pizza for lunch, which was cooked perfectly and very tasty. I love supporting local businesses, and they are very active in our community. I will definitely be coming back and bringing my family with me next time.",

I will never order through Yelp again.",

We ordered a 20\" pepperoni with black olives and pineapple.  While that may be a boring pizza compared to what they offer on the menu, it was what we were all craving at the time. It was promised, via web, to be delivered in approximately 25 minutes.The delivery driver was right on time and friendly. We enjoyed a slight banter while we signed the tab and he was on his way. The pizza covered an area the size of our range top.  When we opened it up, it was beautiful.  There was an abundance of toppings, they did not skimp and we wouldn't have had to order the extra pepperoni that we did. As for the taste... the most important part of this review: it was amazing. We enjoyed every bite and can't waif for the cold version tomorrow at breakfast.",

If you want a decent quick slice just go to Jimmy Joe's down the street. Maybe I was just unlucky and got bad slices but a decent shop would avoid that nonsense!",

Wings were ok but not the best wings I ever had, 1 st time they were quite dry and second time they were good, not great but good.

My bf got the meat lovers, was a bit too greasy but it has greasy meat on it so that is to be some what expected I suppose (so had to knock it down a star thanks to him).

    "text": "This place was not good at all. We went in at 2 pm on a Sunday. The place was pretty empty so we figured we would at least good service but received average service (below average at the end). We ordered traditional and boneless wings and a pizza. The traditional wings were literally the size of my pinky and the flavor was almost non existent. Another reviewer mentioned the boneless wings were frozen Tyson brand and I believed it to be a joke, not anymore. The dough and crust couldn't decide if it was a thin crust or traditional and wasn't chewy or crispy, it was just there. The chicken on the pizza was obviously frozen, probably also Tyson. The cheese was your typical flavorless rubberized mozzarella and even though the pesto was supposedly homemade, they put so little on there was little to no discernable pesto flavor. The tomato sauce had way too much oregano for my liking and was about the only thing I could taste on the Hawaiian pizza. The ham was pretty gross, it was slimy and didn't crisp up like I'm used to. We ordered enough to have leftovers and at the end of it all we didn't end up taking it home with us. The server said she'd bring a box and after waiting 5 minutes in an empty restaurant with still no box we just left. So there's the food and service critique, now let's talk about the actual establishment. Simply put the restaurant was not clean.  When we arrived there were multiple tables that hadn't been cleared and stayed that way for the entire duration of our visit. The floors were dirty, our napkin dispenser was covered in dust, all the glass in the place was covered in fingerprints and dirty, and overall the place just seemed and felt dirty. The worst part of it all is the fact that this place is expensive. We went on 60 wing day but they were so small that it may have been a worse deal then a normally priced wings at any other place. To sum things up, even though this place wasn't offensive to every sense, there isn't any area of this experience I could say was above average. Save yourself and your family the trouble and go to Oregano's up the street.",

I was a little confused when I walked in because there is no signage saying where to order, or if you seat yourself.  The place has \"wings\" and \"pizza\" in the name so it was perfect for the wife and me, until you get the food.  The wings were super tiny.  They may have been half the size of a normal chicken wing.  The sauce was quite good, but I was left disappointed because I didn't have enough actual \"wing\".  The wife had a calzone, and that was pretty solid... very good!  They had drink specials posted for every day of the week and they seemed really decent.  It is just hard for me to get past the itty-bitty wing committee they have going on here.    We will be back, but I am looking forward to trying the pizza with some cheap, cold beer!",

So I ordered 1/2 cheese and 1/2 Deluxe Pizza. Needless to say, when I went to pick it up, it was gigantic and more food than I had wanted since I also got their Fried Mac N Cheese Bites and Small portion of their Wings. The kids each had a slice of pizza so we had plenty of leftovers. The Mac N Cheese bites had mixed reviews. My kids do love Mac N Cheese (whenever they get it) so I thought they'd fall in love with the bites but I was wrong. My youngest thoroughly enjoyed the wings since it wasn't spicy at all and I ordered the Medium spice. Loved all the fresh veggies that came with the meat on the Deluxe. Will definitely come back.",

My heart doctor was quite adamant that I change the things I do. How I eat and what I eat. Although I think he is too strict on his guidelines, I will try to do my best. Which brings me to this review. I like pizza, but not just any pizza, I like good pizza with quality ingredients. Now I know pizza equals carbs. EXCEPT when you get the cauliflower crust. Which is what Zzeeks offers. It is on the menu, but hard to see, because it is in big letters in the middle of the board. How I missed it I do not know. Anyway, it is delicious. I always thought NO WAY. I am not a fan of cauliflower and just thought they were trying to make \"real\" things out of surplus of cauliflower because NO ONE likes cauliflower. While I still believe this conspiracy theory I now know it tastes rather good. Now would I try it from another place? NO. When I talked to Brad about what I wanted to do, he was skeptical too. However he knew if anyone could make this taste half was decent it was Zzeeks. I am very happy this worked out. I do not have to give up pizza. I just can't order their bread bites, but that I can do. We ordered the pizza with red roasted pepper and red onion. It was beyond decent it was appetizing and delicious. The crust was thin and crunchy. Thank you Zesty Zzeeks for making delicious pizza that I can eat.",

They served a full plate of breadstick bites topped with garlic and parmesan. And we ordered one cheese pizza and one pepperoni pizza. All of them were freshly made!!!   One cool thing about this place is that they have little tv's in each booth, which makes it really convenient when there are multiple games going on at the same time.

I'll agree the pizza tasted great, service was really good here (although most were picking up or ordering out while we ate there), and the wings were as expected for the special price point. The wings had good flavor, and the place was clean. Overall good place to go on a Sunday night for some cheap wings and pizza for an average overall cost.",

Jody has treated my family and I with nothing but respect and always has a smile on her face even when she's upset.  People need to respect the hard work that this family puts into their business everyday.  If nobody else has said it, thank you Jody, you are doing a great job and keep up the good work. -Amanda",

    "text": "I TOO HAD A EASY BAKE OVEN!! Can I open a restaurant too?! Funny how it tastes so similar! While strangely nostalgic, I've long since outgrown rubbery, tasteless pizza. Though customers have the ability to draw on the walls and young children are playing with the food behind the counter, this is sadly not chucky cheese. Sorry Zzeek's but I'd rather visit my cousins playroom for more packaged tasting food. At least she knows customer service.  Honestly though, I was not at all impressed with this restaurant. The pizza looked nothing like the picture. The crust was hard and frozen tasting, while the shriveled and sparse toppings slid right off the greasy elastic-like cheese.    The blonde child behind the counter was a bit rude and talked loudly about me and my brother in front of us. It took us forever to get any sort service! I know family comes first, but it's a bit ridiculous when I'm waiting to pay, and everyone is in the back chatting and laughing it up. It's a bit sad when McDonalds has you beat at service. A, \"Hello welcome to Chucky Ch- I mean Zzeeks family own pizza factory\" would have been nice!   I could go on and on about the service, the children working behind the counter, the overpriced food, the lack of pizza boxes that don't fall apart, and much much more.   If you want to find out for yourself what a horrid place this is, be my guest! It's an entertaining place to be :)",

Pulling up I thought \"looks like your run-of-the-mill shopping center type joint\" bit decided it was still worth a stop.  I am sure glad we did. The service was amazing from the moment we walked in the door and the food was fantastic.  I choose to have my calzone deep fried (I know, I know, but it's worth it!) and was quite happy with the result. The texture is perfect and the added crispness was a pleasant surprise. When it was delivered I was asked if I wanted ranch or marinara to dip it in. My reply was \"marinara, no, ranch, well, I don't know. I guess ranch.\" Their reply \"you must mean both. Both it is then!\" Little customer service touches like that are what sets Zzeek's apart from the competition.  Looking forward to my next Phoenix trip which well certainly conclude with a visit to Zzeek's!",

    "text": "Zzeek's Pizza Factory -  I discovered them shortly after they opened.  Frankly, they are one of the best pizza locations I've been to in the Ahwatukee area.  These guys are conscientious of their customers and serve a great product.  Their bread-sticks and Zzepoli's are bar none.  The pizza is quite wonderful.  But the thing that really sets them apart is their customer service.  I have food allergies.  They go out of their way every time I show up to make sure I have a good experience.  Last time I went with my friends - the wrong order of bread-sticks was delivered to my table and the cook dashed out of the kitchen to make sure I didn't eat any of that order.  He then replaced it with no further charge.  The same visit we over heard an incident with a lady who was vegan and the pizza she ordered might have had Parmesan cheese added to it, the worker at the counter went out of their way to make sure the pizza was adequate to the customer's dietary needs informing of the possible error and replacing the pizza.  My friends and I often have a joke about Pizza in Phoenix: \"Flavor is a double topping\" due to places like Nello's or Jimmy's where usually we have to order garlic and basil as toppings to get any decent flavor out of the pizza.  This is not the case at Zzeek's.  The crust is good, the sauce is robust and flavorful and the cheese is very good.  I have quickly become a regular here and will continue to be.",

The pizza tasted like it was from the frozen pizza section in the bashas that is in the same parking lot...and not even one of the decent frozen brands.  The bacon and sausage on top were pathetic looking and tasted the same.  The whole pizza left much to be desired.    I was also not to thrlled about the younger cook using his bare hands to toss the pizza dough in the air.  Hopefully I am not the only one bothered by that.      This was a take out order and after I had paid I asked for ranch.  The manager said the ranch dressing is usually 30cents per container but this time would be free.  I guess I am not a restaurant owner but charging for ranch seems a bit tough.  Especially thinking how much money must be made on that mark up if you do sell a lot of it.",

That was a couple months ago, and we have now been there three times. Obviously, we love it!  You should be aware that the sauce they use on the pizza is a little spicy. We had the opportunity to talk with the owner/chef and he mentioned that they do make it and they used to make it even spicier. We like spice so it is great.  The breadsticks are a must-try. They are small and bite-sized so you end up with more of the crunchy ends. And they do not skimp on the seasoning like a lot of other places do with their breadsticks.  Finally, make sure you save some room for dessert. The zzepoles are awesome. Basically, they are fried balls of pizza dough with powdered sugar. They are surprisingly light.  If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend checking ZZeek's out. We will definitely be returning.",

I was expecting really good pizza, along the standards of Spinatos. Especially when you consider the price. I rank this along the lines of Dominoes or Papa Murphy's for flavor. I ordered a thin crust pizza and it looked hand tossed to me. I can only imagine the hand tossed must be along the lines of a pan pizza. Otherwise, they got my order wrong, which is still bad. The crust is tough and lacks flavor as well. I ordered mozzarella sticks and they look like they were from the frozen section of the grocery. I was expecting a crunchy breading with italian spices in the mix. The marinara isn't flavored much with spices, which I suppose is good for old people with digestive issues. I think the marinara is part of why the pizza does not have much flavor. I really wanted to like this place, but for the price, I will stick to places that really do have thin crust and more flavor like Mod Pizza for quick pizza and Spinatos. I need to go now and drown my pizza in garlic powder and pepper. My twelve inch deluxe and mozzarella came to $23.",

We had a great time and you can tell they are very focused on making the experience great.

They make the basic pepperoni pizza taste scrumptious! I recommend the Caribbean Style wings and a side of breadsticks. Jodi was welcoming and attentive. Thank you, this is just what we needed after a long drive!!!!",

The tables were filthy and employees looked very miserable and the lady in charge was kinda rude to customers! Not a way to run a business! Stay away from this overrated crappy pizza joint!",

Third, the people who work there look depressed and I can see why; the older lady whom I presume to be one of towner is extremely rude and talks back to customers. In conclusion, the food is very under-par and its way too loud with rude employees.  Maybe she is mixing me up with another person? But I don't know why she is assuming I am the person that she is referring to in her reply. Because those statements are unTrue. I actually changed my review a star higher, so I don't know why this warranted a reply. I changed it from 1 star to 2. To me, that's an improvement.",

One half I wanted red onions among other things and they put green peppers on it instead which made that half of the pizza inedible because I'm allergic to peppers. So thanks for that! I'm pretty mad I spent the money and couldn't eat it. Is there any way to compensate for that?  UPDATE: Jody the manager was great at fixing the situation.

I really enjoyed the pizza (I asked for pepperoni and sausage) and the employees were very nice. I thought it was an extraordinary value. $6 with two toppings.  It's less with one topping I think. The portion was more like 2-3 slices in a small Pizza.   I personally wouldn't expect them to make a fresh pizza every time when ordering this special, so maybe it's not quite as good when it's not this fresh?  I'm not sure. But I thought it was terrific.    I'm pretty new to Chandler and have been looking for a pizza spot anyway. So now I've found it. I look forward to eating there more often and sampling some of The other items.",

TVs on the tables for the children, so they don't see you drinking your fifth beer. Kids can count at a much earlier age, you know. I don't have kids so this does not pertain to me, but you know who you are. We saw you. Drinking and singing badly in front of the locals while your kids stayed glued to Sponge Bob. The pizza was extremely average. We thought it a mix between Papa Johns and Pizza Hut. But its something to suck up the alcohol after you sing your lungs out to Fall Out Boy. The wings were heavily breaded and not my thing. Kids probably like those , too. Yelp gets you  a sack of free grease balls, aka zeppole that will test your stomach acids but taste really good, reminded me of the state fair \"we fry everything booth\".",

And pizza in awhatukee in general. It's f***ing delicious. And of the zillion times I have ever eaten here/ordered delivery, I have had a problem ONCE. That was thru a third party app (use them so I can tip our delivery person without my kid having to sign my credit card slip). And even then-they delivered a FREE pizza. They strive for customer service. Their employees are amazingly attentive. They have &2.50 bottle beer all day every day. And they have a decent draft selection. Our first visit to the joint years ago was after moving to the neighborhood and the manager (?owner) gave us free dessert to welcome us. I honestly can't praise them enough. They have teenagers working here but they give better service than half the restaurant staff in the Tuk. The angry mustard Wing are To.Die.For. And I have never met a pizza I don't love. If you eat in-try the challenge. The boyfriemd and teenager won T-shirt's and free food for conquering. Seriously those who review this and say they prefer Dominos or Papa Johns or Pizza Hut have questionable judgement. Trust me. I'm a pizza snob. And really just am all around snob. So there",

My wife went with the Honey BBQ boneless and she said it didn't taste like BBQ sauce. The pizza was on par with peter piper pizza. It was tomato sauce on card board. The ingredients where very cheap and probably frozen at one time. The wife said her plain cheese pizza was ok. I did a split on my pizza. I did half Grand slam and half chicken pesto. This way I could run them up against Venezia's my fav Arizona pizza since that is pretty much my order there. Pesto sauce was weak. The spinach over powered their sauce. I held the sun dried tomatoes and did garlic instead. Still didn't get a hint of garlic. The crust was weak the bread had no flavor. Then onto the Grand Slam this was when I was disappointed really hard core. Like I said before it tasted like there ingredients all had the same flavor. And the flavor was from the freezer. Bottom line is if you want cheap pizza domino's or Pizza hut is way better. If you want Great pizza that costs as much as Zesty Zzeeks order Venezia's.",

I tried to confirm with the cashier what type of cheese was in the jalapeno poppers and she didn't know. That's not a problem but I realized she wasn't going to ask her colleagues for clarification unless I asked her to ask. Also my gf ordered the wings and requested half and half on the sauces. They came out all one sauce, and when we inquired about it we were told they only do once sauce per order. That's not a problem but it's something that we should've known before the food hit the table; we wouldn't have minded but we should've know what to expect. The wings themselves were ordered as all flats which came out correct. They came with the driest most pitiful carrot sticks I've seen. They're are \"just carrot sticks\" but they were still plated with the wings. At that point, don't even serve the carrot sticks. Open a new bag, prep some more, or just say you ran out and let the customer know carrot sticks are 86'd for the night.  Of course we ordered pizza too, and that was definitely the best part. I'd also say it's the most important part. The crust was essentially as non existent as it can be with sauce and toppings going all the way to the edge prior to baking. I would definitely go back again for the pizza and even though the menu is pretty similar to most pizza places, the first experience we had would definitely help the next time around.",

We had a large group coming in to celebrate a milestone birthday for one of those regulars, and received an interesting response.  We were prepared to pay big bucks for food and beverages, yet instead of welcoming us with open arms and helping with arranging things, the staff kept warning us not to take up too much space or over staying our welcome.  There were only 14 of us so I'm not sure why they were so concerned. And although it was a little busy - no one got turned away that night.   The pizza was decent - their large is huge!  We also loved the 10\" cauliflower crust option - it was pretty good.  The beer selection was okay, but not great. Salads are nice size. We got some wings which were a little overcooked. My husband wasn't crazy about them.  We tried the zzeepoles (lots of powdered sugar) - they were good.   Overall, not a bad place. The tables are really crowded together.  The karaoke DJ was very nice and encouraging. The staff were really great once things got rolling.",

My boyfriend and I order here a lot-- the pizza is great and it's a really fast delivery.  The crust, sauce and cheese ratio is spot on and it's absolutely delicious.  We also partake in their wing Sundays!   Hot wings at a heavy discount.  Love the Caribbean style and hot.  They do boneless and bone-in but if you aren't bone-in, I'm judging you.  I believe they're 60 cents each.  I prefer these wings over any I've had in the valley and that's saying a lot.  Everyone is really friendly here.  It's a small business, it's a little pricey but it's worth it!",

You can't go wrong as a pizza aficionado.   The first time we ordered, we did delivery, then take out a few times. With the exception of the most recent experience, every time has been quick, easy and of course delicious. On the last occasion, however, I don't think they even put in my order until we arrived for pickup 15-20 minutes later, and acted very confused. We then waited another 20-30 minutes for the pizza. Maybe it was on off day? Or maybe our expectations had become too high. I'll certainly return but we might try out a few other places first.",

Stop nitpicking this place and appreciate it for what it is. A local gem with great customer service and a genuine concern for the community. I will support this place all day long.

    "text": "My husband, daughter, and I went into Zzeeks around 2 o'clock on a Wednesday. We were excited to try it because my husband had worked with Jody when she was the manager of a Dominoes Pizza several years ago.  As we entered, we noticed that the tables were filthy. They were covered in grease and crumbs that we had to clean off ourselves, and the restaurant was not at all busy.   As we looked over the menu, I heard the manager, Jody Pectol, talking to her crew about how a wing order needed to be perfect for her clients that were coming in to pickup a very large order.  When our waiter arrived, my husband and I ordered a dozen salt and pepper wings and our little one ordered the chicken strip meal. When our wings arrived, they were visibly burnt and after tasting one, our observations were confirmed.  When we notified the waiter that the wings were burnt, he was very rude. He said, \"Maybe the flavor you're tasting is the salt and pepper. We cook all our wings this way. We could put a sauce over them or if you'd like to try us again, you could order them less cooked next time.\"   I told him that I didn't see any option on the menu that stated a \"less cooked\" option in order for them not to be burned and that putting a sauce over the wings would not change the fact that they were burnt.   To which he said, \"Oh, it's not something listed on the menu but you could try ordering them less cooked next time.\"  Like I would ever consider a \"next time\" after this! If they \"cook all their wings this way\" then why did the manager have to tell the crew specifically not to mess up the wing order for the high-profile client that was coming in? Why did this waiter feel the need to go on and on about how it must be my fault that I am tasting a burnt flavor when all he had to do was offer to remake them or refund us our money? I felt completely disrespected by the staff at Zzeeks. We will not be back.",

I decided to give them a try when I was craving pizza while watching the U of A game at home with hubby last Saturday night. I know pizza is no health food but I was happy to have a lower carb option available. We got a 10\" Deluxe and an order of 10 honey hot wings. I didn't really care for the wings since they were breaded but hubby ate most of them and seemed to really enjoy them. We both loved the pizza though! It was a little more expensive that someplace like Pizza Hut but I thought it tasted way better, even with the cauliflower crust. You could tell that all the veggie toppings were very fresh and I also loved the flavor of the pepperoni (I am a little picky on that). I will definitely order from them again!  I also saw in the flyer that they sell Eegee's which I did not partake of this time but also made this Wildcat girl smile.",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch this past Friday. I had never been here, as it is out of my Central Phoenix stomping grounds.   I ordered the \"Big Slice\" Lunch Special with a salad and a drink. The very nice young lady at the counter asked me if I wanted toppings on the pizza, I opted for pepperoni. $10.25 total including a 15% tip.   Then she asked if I wanted a side salad or a \"House\" salad. I asked for the House salad with Italian dressing.   She handed me a cup for my drink and said to have a seat, the food would be out in a few minutes.   After a few a nice lady came out and asked if I ordered the \"House \" salad. When she put it down, I could not believe my eyes.   Thick sliced Turkey, Canadian Bacon, Bacon chunks (not sprinkles, chunks) ,.... way more than would come on any good salad anywhere for twice the price, plenty of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, purple onion, bell peppers, and fresh ground parmesan cheese on top. Really a meal in itself. The only down side was the packet of Newman's Own dressing, I'll bet they could make a hell of an in-house dressing, but you can't satisfy everyone. :)  Then came the \"Big Slice\".... two slices of New York style, thin crust, absolutely perfectly crispy, cheesy, spicy sauced tasty, tasty pizza.   I'm not a fast eater, and due to time constraints, I couldn't finish the salad, though I so wanted to.  I also had to ask for a box for the second slice 'o pizza, which one of my co-workers could not stop complimenting as he ate it.   I don't do many reviews, but this place was SO good, I needed to say it out loud.   Thank you Zzeeks, I will be back, soon.",

Great deal and perfect for watching football games. Every booth has an individual tv and there are larger TVs throughout the store. They have many flavors to choose from and today we got medium and honey citrus pepper. The wings are breaded and fried and I will definitely ask for extra crispy next time. I didn't sense any heat in the medium flavor and will try hot another time. The honey citrus pepper were delicious! The sauce was great and you could truly taste honey, citrus & pepper! We didn't stay long, but we got two pieces of pepperoni pizza to go. Good pizza, reminded us of Barro's!   Zzeeks also carries eegees!!! (Tucson people will know how exciting this is!) eegees is a shaved ice company in Tucson with shaved ice made from fresh fruit. We got guava today and it was so refreshing and tasted just like a guava! Yum!   Looking forward to trying their cauliflower pizza crust which people rave about.",

    "text": "I'm adding a new review, this time reflecting the inconsistency with our 'go to' orders (we still order quite a bit). They've never decided to add anything between the pizza and the cardboard box, so depending on how long it takes to get here, or how many veggies we get, the pizza box gets soggy in the middle and the crust loses the crisp :/ I find it better the next day because I'm not into wet pizza. There is also inconsistency with how done/overdone the pizza is. Not sure of they use a timer or what, but it's always a surprise if we get a crust that's a little chewy if it's over cooked. And most recently we were delivered a pizza with burnt to a crisp roasted red peppers (which are from a jar so they aren't roasting them and accidentally over roasting). While the manager on duty offered a credit or a new pizza, he never once apologized until the end. They sent a new pizza and it was delicious- luckily the staff that night decided to put in some extra effort on their re-do. Meanwhile, my boyfriend sent a photo to their IG with the burnt pizza and the response was that \"well it's impossible to not burn that pizza with sundried tomatoes and no cheese\" lol. Well, we didn't order sun dried tomatoes (or combo was pesto base, ricotta, roasted red pepper), and if you know a combo doesn't work for whatever reason, then tell a customer that their pizza will be burnt if they don't choose a new combo. My point, and reason for dropping a star, is that with more locations open, the quality and consistency is lacking now that the locations may not be as family operated. I won't stop ordering, because if still rather risk it and support Zzeek and Jody while I can, as opposed to Pizza Hut or Dominos, but I do hope things don't change for the worse any more.",

Worst service ever. Manager left early instead of confirming our order was ready on time. Will never visit this location again. No reason to lose an order when the restaurant was so slow and had people standing around. Unprofessional manager and inexcusable service provided.

    "text": "Hello ALL,   I first ate at Zzeeks Pizza about 2 years ago when a good friend Marian referred my Fiance and I to it saying it was the best pizza in town. Little did I know my kids had already been there with their mom prior to me knowing about it and loved it as well.   So we tried it and loved it. They have the best ranch dressing as well. Since then we have gone inside to eat and order delivery. The best thing about Zzeeks is they are family owned and very customer friendly to everyone. There was a time or two where they delivered and forgot the ranch dressing and because it was their mistake, they brought us another cheesy bread for free without us even asking. The owner said it was our mistake and we wanted you to have fresh cheesy bread as well. If you ever have a problem they will take good care of you with no hassle. Great people and great service. If you havent tried Zzeeks then you are missing out! Also what place do you know where the owner sometimes personally delivers to your home. I honestly can't say enough good things about these great people.  THANKS AGAIN ZZEEKS, KEEP UP THE GREAT SERVICE!!!! :)  Sencerely,  Mike and Jordan Knowles",

    "text": "We gave this place a try twice because of gift certificates from my employer. Mediocre prices at best. No real deals.  Pizza was sub par. Dough was not cooked enough, not enough sauce. Cheese was cheap and chewy, similar to chain joints.  Prices on the paper menu were not the same as the over head menu and the prices we were charged where higher than both of the listed menu prices.  I was told they had recently changed their prices. But in reality they did not change their prices they simply started charging people more. None of their prices had been updated and when I inquirws why i was not charged menu prices I was not offered any discounts or compensation.  Move along, this is not the pizzeria you are looking for.",

And they were packed (7pm on a Friday).They do have beer on tap and karaoke on Friday evenings 6-9 (If memory serves). All the kids where singing no adults. Very entertaining. A couple of the kids were quite good. We had the meat pizza and were not disappointed. Very good pizza, nice amount of toppings and tasty sauce. Winds were cooked perfectly. Not too dry, I can't stand over cooked wings. We finished eating and stayed to watch a couple of the kids sing. I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "I placed a phone order for a delayed pickup of a to-go sausage pizza, an Italian Beef (they call it a Chicago Beef) and some hot wings.  I arrived at the store, settled the bill and stepped outside to wait because it was still in the oven which is much preferred over having it waiting in cardboard of course- given I was in no hurry.  Stupendous.  Timed perfectly and hand delivered to my parked car outside the door by a helpful young staffer.  Presented/wrapped nicely for transport...the beef sandwich was exactly to my liking.  Not soggy but with some ajus for dipping.  Sandwich roll would be much better if it was crunchy outside and soft inside.  You know.  Like Chicago rolls that, when opened, leave a handful of crumbs on the tablecloth but this is Arizona and you can't get decent bread here except Safeway (40th St./Chandler Blvd) has great French loaves and bulk hardrolls that you can drop into paper bags provided so they stay crunchy but wait, I'm writing a review for Zzeeks so nevermind that right now)  ...pizza was nicely thin w/ yummy sauce and the wings, although not very crispy (I had asked for well done), were excellent (although not cayenne hot enough for me) and a bit wet from the sturdy packaging sweat no doubt so better after air-drying for a while.  Served w/ ample white dressing and some veggie sticks for a classy finish.  Three menu items.   Three home runs.  Thank you, Zzeeks.  I'll be back.  === UPDATE: um, dummy, you have to hit \"submit\" ===  Yes.  I'm a complete ninny and forget to actually post that review above from several weeks ago.  yelp saves your unfinished entry.  So, I'll continue..  Some weeks later, I thought I'd try the online order process via <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fzzeeks.com&s=d14d3c5a9a1c8768923775fc9e183d2fbb3e118c136b5a56ac969a440a11fc27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">zzeeks.com</a>.  I entered an order very similar to the one above and included CC info to pre-pay online. System tells me the order will be done in like 11 minutes and I should have an email receipt.  I live nearby but, geeze, I don't even have my shoes on and no email has been received yet so I phone the store...   Greeted by a nice young man (I'm guessing prepubescent) somewhat hurried (much activity in the background which is usually a good indication after 35 years of trickle-down Reagan lies leaving a beleaguered citizenry with virtually no disposable income for frilly extras like food but willing to sacrifice other necessities for good pizza ) so I explained the lack-o-email.  He said, \"we probably didn't get the order\".  Well, OK, I now repeated my order over the phone with still, the 11 minute ETA.  [I didn't occur to me to ask for a slight delay while I tried to find my shoes.]  I get there a few minutes tardy, store is busy but not slammed, the order is already waiting for me and, without thinking about my online payment, I pay the kid cash [I was right, he was about 11 but very professional]  and leave w/ my pizza, sandwich, wings.  Food commentary:  Pizza was kinda lame/cooled [admittedly, I was tardy] but how does a pizza get made, baked, packaged and old in 11 minutes?  Hmmm.  But wait.  There's more.  Bottom crust flour burn!  My pet peeve!  I know that Zzeeks knows this so I'm stating only for the casual review reader:  Pizza oven stones have to be scraped throughout the shift.  It sucks, it's hard, it's hot and in a busy store with a crowded oven, it's often neglected.  My first purchase (reviewed above) did not suffer this so I'll excuse a one-off for now but for the record, the overpriced Mellow Mushroom down the street at 50th St./Ray did this to me twice and they lost a customer.  The punchline is yet to come so hang with me...  Some time later, of course, the on-line order charge is debited from my account!  Again, this is on me for not mentioning it when I paid cash but an annoyance nonetheless.  I jot down the date, specs, amount on a sheet of paper and, when passing Zzeeks a few days later, I stop in to talk to the manager.  A pleasant gentlemen greets me:  \"Manager's not here.  Can I help?\"  -sigh-  As I start with my story he interrupts me:  \"How much do we owe you?\"  I try to explain that I've already requested a credit via the website and don't want to make this worse.  He opens the till, hands me $32.20.  I assure him that, if a credit shows up, I'll come back with a check.  He says, \"I believe you would\", and asks, \"Is there anything else you need?\"  I say \"Yes.  May I have your name?\"  He responds:  \"Zzeek\"  Now you know the rest of the story.  Can you see me at the Pizza Hut counter with my lame debit card story?  \"Could I speak to Mr. Hut please?\"  I'd have to hire an attorney and leave my DNA.  I'm looking forward to my next order.  I'll be on time.  The oven stones will be scraped.  I'll order in person and pay with money.  It doesn't get better.  -paul",

    "text": "This place started out with great food and great attitudes. The toppings were chopped up nicely on the pies and the pizza was cooked to perfection. As they gained success the pies started arriving overcooked with bubbles in them and toppings haphazardly thrown on top in unappetizing chunks. The sauce and cheese was far more sparse as well. When I call to place an order lately suddenly I'm getting an attitude projected at me like I'm ripping them off for utilizing a coupon that they themselves had sent me in the mail. Additionally the cost of these pies is several dollars higher than their competitors, as if they were still offering a superior pizza like when they first opened, with the pies no longer being any better than the competitors. In fact, they are overcooked and unappealing and inferior at this point.  It's sad to see as they became successful they forgot what made them successful. I also found a note written in ink on my pizza box in big letters GET THE COUPON...again, acting like I was a thief for using a coupon mailer they had sent me. I never had a pizza place do this to me before. ZZeeks WAS good, they are no longer,now, they just want to grab the money. Plenty of places closer to me with better pies, better attitudes, less cost, no no obnoxious notes written on the boxes. Their pizza has been far from \"amazing\" or even decent  for a long time.",

Just a weird thing. I asked the guy at the front how big of a deal it would be to maybe get the boneless. I was expecting a simple no because it's wasting 20 wings. Instead of making me feel dumber than I already felt, he politely said that if I didn't mind waiting, he'll have them right out. I'm a wing and pizza fanatic, being a Chicago native. This place is definitely going to be my new hang out spot for an ice cold PBR on tap (I know. I'm cheap lol). Can't wait to dine in soon! And shout out to the wonderful staff you have working here.

    "text": "Good pizza, though overpriced.  First of all, in my humble opinion the best pizza for the dollar is at Costco, and the best $20 pizza is at Nello's.  That said, I was interested in trying Zzeek's as they advertised that they were not a franchise, so I figure I'd try it and give the little guy a chance.  I ordered a 16-inch Deluxe ($19.99) for pickup, and it was ready in 15 - 20 minutes, about normal for pizza these days.  The toppings were fresh, the sauce tasty, the bread good and yeasty.  All in all it was a good pie, not the best but tolerable.  It was better than the $10 Costco combo, but not close to the Nello's combo.  It was a decent pizza for $14, but certainly not $20.",

    "text": "Two reviews in one -  Dine in experience - Jody was great, customer service exceptional, great tasting food. Got a discount on another pizza when we left. They serve Eeggee's at this location, a Tucsonian favorite! Great bottle beer specials. Beware of Karaoke on certain nights. First time patrons.  5 stars  Delivery experience - overcharged for delivery. Partially my fault, but was offered a coupon by mail for a free pizza which was originally what we thought we were getting by signing up for their text-to-phone coupon flier we received. Manager did not want to offer the deal even though it said nothing on the text about dine in only. No biggie though! I doubt we will receive the coupon but I was extremely disappointed in their \"boneless wings\" which were no more than Tyson chicken nuggets with a light flavoring of med buffalo. My wife described them as chicken balls. Very chewy and I actually spit out a couple of hard pieces that I couldn't chew through. 2 stars  I think one of the biggest differences between the dine in and the delivery experience was the pizza. My wife is from Boston and the pizza during our dine in experience was very similar to Papa Gino's, a Boston favorite of hers. Our delivery pizza tasted something between Domino's and Papa Johns. Very odd to notice the difference.  Bread stick bites are great, consistent between the two!  We will most likely try Zeek's again but only dine-in.   Hope this review helps!   UPDATE: it's been two weeks and never received a voucher for our pizza. Needless to say we are a little disappointed in the lack of follow through.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were drawn by the 4 star rating and sign saying it was the \"1st place best of 2014\". So walking in our expectations were high.   First impression: prices are -$$$$- and the place was a bit dirty; we had to decide which table was the least messy to eat at.   We ordered 1 fountain drink cup, a 20 inch Hawaiian pizza, 10 honey hot and 10 medium wings. The total came out to be over 30$.   Overall the food was okay. Definitely not the best pizza and wings, more like mediocre. The wings were tiny  and the sauce was average. The honey hot was more like honey bbq and the medium was definitely mild. The pizza was thin crust, but not crispy enough. They put huge slices of ham? on the pizza and the pineapple seemed old. Their fountain drink selection is limited (their brewed teas were just water), I wish I had just gotten a water cup instead.   Also, beware, it seems to be a high school hangout spot. It seemed like the whole senior class was there and the cashier couldn't have been more excited.   Overall, we probably won't be coming again. The price is too high for the atmosphere and taste.",

    "text": "I used to eat pizza regularly, but that was YEARS ago. For the past umteen years, if I eat pizza more than once a year, that's a LOT... until I found Zzeeks.  I got hungry for pizza a couple months ago and went looking for something besides the standard pizza chains. I ran across Zzeeks here and saw lots of good reviews so I ordered.  I've ordered 4 MORE times since then!!   Now, I can only tell you about the pizza toppings, because I'm a low carber. Everything has been super full of flavor. The white sauce is to die for but I still order half and half because I do like the red sauce too. But the Philly Steak is incredible, so that's been on ALL my orders... in fact, I've been ordering extra on that one. The meatballs are awesome too!  As for the delivery, the guys are super fast (first place I've ever ordered pizza delivery where they give you an estimated 25 minute delivery time and then follow thru on it (and that's saying a LOT because my address is tough to find). Speaking of, if you have an off way to your house, they don't have a \"special delivery note\" area on their site yet (I've submitted the suggestion), so you may wanna call and have them add a note for the delivery guy.  All of them that have come here have been super friendly too!! I don't find that ANYwhere on a consistent basis in today's world so when I do find them, I'll keep getting food from them!  Also, you can order online for a later delivery. Today's the first day I've ordered that way, so we'll see how that works out. :)  I'm sure I'll eventually try their wings, but so far, I'm just loving the pizza!",

You must have no taste buds and a shame since most folks are transplants from bigger citys that have REAL pizza.  I have ordered from here on a few occasions always hoping to get a better pie.  Today was my last.  Ordered a large sausage with half black olives and mushrooms and some wings. $40 with tip - could get a much better pizza from Rosattis, Bella Italia or Nellos for that cost.  There were such little toppings it was pathetic but gobs of cheese. I would have to say it was less than a cup of sausage on the entire pizza. We ordered thin crust which is never cooked right, always soggy in the middle and only crusty on the ends.  If you are looking for a good pizza go to Nello's, Rosati, Bella Italia.  I'm all for supporting local chains but you guys need to fix your product.",

Sadly last time I ordered they forgot to put my ranch in the box. I ate 3 wings and tossed them, I couldn't eat the soggy guys with the disgusting blue cheese. The salads! Why why why must you buy the bag mix? Get some fresh lettuce and chop it yourself. The bag shit is grosssssssss and cheap!!!!

First,  my large chef's salad didn't come with the ranch dressing it was supposed to.  Second, normally I have to use two hands to eat this pizza due to being full of toppings and hot.  Tonight, it was barely warm and stiff, like it had sat out for awhile.  I WILL order from them again unless this happens again.    UPDATE: The service and quality has been restored to 4-5 star ratings.  The management reached out to me which was much appreciated.",

I recently tried the meatballs and I swear they are fantastic. I have to note that I do believe they have the very best service in all of Ahwatukee. Totally kid friendly. The delivery service is way above par. I ordered a salad for 12 people on Christmas day and the owner actually delivered it on Christmas. They also have yummy deserts!  This is a wonderful family friendly restaurant. The pizza is fantastic and the customer service is great. They make you feel like family.",

With all the build your own pizza places popping up in the city, I was expecting to be wowed. Sadly I wasn't.   My first hint was it was empty on a Saturday night at 6pm. I hate that you have to order from a counter then sit down, who do I tip? Counter girl? The 2 different guys that brought me my food? I'm confused. I dislike this system. I dislike having to get my own beverage. It's like 1/2 fast food, 1/2 casual dining.   Our appetizer was good, it was just fried cheese. Chicken wings were weird. The breading wasn't crispy, it was soggy. Just a weird texture to a wing. Good size and good sauce, I did not like the breading. Pizza was........just...........o..k. Not a single negative thing, but not a positive thing I can say either.  I don't get the star rating. Apparently there's like 3 or more of these places, so I guess they do well, and I'm a strong local business supporter, but good luck to you all.",

It's decorated pretty cool and has a really good vibe. We went there on a Friday and was pleasently surprised that they had karaoke on. Whilst I won't hold the standard of vocalists against Zzeeks I have to say it was very entertaining.   Will definitely be coming here to hang out and have a slice of pizza with a beer soon. Honestly, beer seems to make all the difference. The staff are always cool and when I order delivery it never really takes too long.",

I called and the phone was answered quickly and enthusiastically. A large can be 16\" or 20\" so I ordered a 16\" ham and pineapple. \"Expect a delicious soft crust with red sauce on your pizza in 20 minutes.   May I call in an hour to be sure you were satisfied ?\"  An amazingly delicious pizza arrived in 15 minutes. Lots of pineapple and larger than expected slices of ham. Wonderful red sauce and soft crust. It was so tasty that I ate four slices before I could stop. I did receive a phone call from Zzeek's inquiring about my satisfaction. Not typical of most pizza shoppes, it was as if my order was special and they would always strive to make excellent dishes.  A 16\" pizza that hit all of the taste buds for under $17  ? delivered ?? The driver earned his tip by arriving while the pizza was still hot and making sure the box stayed level. I hate it when the contents are scrunched in the corner.  Zzeek's, you are my new go to pizza emporium.",

The sauce really stands out from any other we've had in a long time.  So many of the chains have defaulted to an overly sweet sauce.  Leave it to an independent to make it the way it should be!  Zzeeks sauce has a great herby/spiciness that is hard to beat.  While I was happy with the toppings we chose for our pizza, my next one might just be cheese with a extra sauce!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner with my family, and the meal was lovely. Our server was very attentive and helpful with all of our questions about the menu. Overall, our experience was spot on. The problem? When our check came, I tipped our server accordingly, as they worked hard to deserve it. As it turns out, they didn't receive it. This particular restaurant does not allow the servers to keep the tips they make. They don't even tell them how much they have received. At the end of the week, they \"divide it up\" amongst the entire staff. To some, this may sound fair. But in the restaurant business, cooks make an hourly wage to compensate them for their hard work in a consistent manner. Servers make a very small hourly wage, but depend on their tips as their income. The owners make their money in the profits from sales. I was astonished to find out about their backwards approach to compensation. I'm pretty sure this is illegal. Nowhere on the menu, in any sign in the building, or on the receipt does it express that the tip I designate for my server is taken by the owner. Anyone seen Restaurant Nightmare, Amy's Baking Company? Same concept.  I would definitely come back again, however, now I know to always tip in cash and express to my server that it is for them and them alone, not for the owners.",

(Same thing to the people behind me)  and when my order was ready he just handed to me and said nothing... I would  eat there again cause it was yummy and the prices are good! But I will get delivery so u wouldn't have to face that issue again and if the driver isn't friendly there will b no tip and I won't try it again!",

Customer service was super nice, she even gave me a coupon before checking out!, so I saved $1.50.  Clean and sporty place, if I weren't just traveling thru, I would've gone back. Oh!- and there's a patio so me my husband and two dogs enjoyed our lunch outside. She even brought me a water bowl for the pups.",

Excellent atmosphere.  they even let you write (with dry erase marker) on the wall)  How cool is that.  This will definitely be one of our regular places.  P.S.  TV's to watch sports too.  Many +++++ positives.  Too bad all the positive rating are filtered.  Because they ARE AWESOME!!!!",

I love love love that they do the free delivery. I hope they keep that up because it is the main reason we get it when we are deciding whether to go here or somewhere else. Got a delivery zzeeks on the way right now!",

Outside the west valley must mean we're close, right?  Why?  Because he and his buddies think the Zzepoles are the greatest food EVER!!!",

Every interaction I've ever had with their employees has been positive, from the people answering the phone and taking orders to the delivery drivers. I love their barbecue chicken pizza so much I could write a sonnet about it, and I just might.",
