    "text": "I love that we're getting so many more Korean restaurants in the valley! I came here with some friends to check them out and they're located in a pretty good spot in Mesa in a new Asian plaza. The restaurant is pretty big and spacious which was nice because I hate sitting at a restaurant where another table is so close they can pretty much be part of your party. They had a good selection of food and they give you a ton of banchan (side dishes). I got the yookgaejang which is a shredded beef, spicy soup. It was spicy and had good flavor and seasoned well. The meat was really tender and it was probably one of the best yookgaejangs I've had in the valley. My friend got this fish roe soup and that was also really good and had good flavor. All of their soups were really good and I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a Korean restaurant in Mesa.",

Service was a little slow even being two of the few people there at the time.  Overall, I'll be back!",

Myself and a couple of friends had similiar experiences regarding a specific area of service. It has become a pattern that our food is forgotten and we have to remind the waiter/waitress about our order. This issue would be solved simply with the waiter/waitress reading the order back to the customer but we did not see them writing down or confirming the order. The dishes came out at different times which caused an awkward eating experience where my friend just watched me eat while waiting for a dish that should've come out 30 minutes ago. This incident did not happen with one waiter but it occurred amongst multiple visits. But otherwise, great and we will be back.",

The soup was really tasty and you can tell the server how mild to hot (spicy) you'd like it. The banchans -side dishes were pretty standard. The kim chi was really fresh. Also the gongnamul  was made spicy which I enjoyed. The server was sweet and attentive. The food came out fast.  Promising place! I would recommend.",

    "text": "We came here on a whim.  We were checking out the local market and decided to give it a go.  We arrived and the room was about half full.  But they made us wait in the foyer.  Why?  There are empty tables.  At least they gave us a menu to peruse.  So they take us to a table (there are still a lot of empty tables here!), and the waiter explains the menu.  Looking for bibimbap?  It's not there under that name.  It's under \"stone bowls\".  Those dishes are brought out in very hot stone bowls, and those bowls actually finish cooking the food for you.  Stab the nearly raw egg of your bibimbap and start stirring...it finishes cooking really fast.  So my wife orders that, and I go for bulgogi.  This comes with \"side dishes\".  These are small bowls full of weird things.  Some are fine, some not so much.  But of course that's personal taste.  The broccoli was tasty.  The fish strips were kind of odd, but not bad.  I think there was eggplant, and cucumber, but I can't remember them all now.  You can have as much of the sides as you want, which is kinda nice.  Honestly, I'd rather have a soup or something similar.  My bulgogi came with purple rice.  Apparently they cook it with a variety of bean, and that turns it purple.  Don't let it bother you, it's really nice.  My wife stirred in her egg and the bibimbap came together pretty quickly for her.  We both liked our food.  Serving was big enough to take about half home.  Still a bit pricey even with the larger portions and endless sides.  Service was slow and inattentive.  They didn't seem to be slammed (empty tables!), but maybe they were short-staffed?  Dunno.  But we had to call our waiter over or he didn't visit our table.  This is really probably 3.5 stars, but with the mediocre service I can't justify rounding up to 4.  So three stars it is.  The food was pretty good.  We might come back, though I'm hearing about another place I might want to try first (Hodori - not has highly rated as this place though).",

The reason why I'm giving it five stars is because in comparison to the arizona places, it's really good. Service was great and everything was clean. We went in looking for bibimbaps, so we got the basic meat one and the fish eggs. Although both were a little bit pricey, the taste matched the expectations that went along with the high prices. The rice was perfectly crisp with the stone bowl, something that didn't happen often at other places.  They gave a lot of banchans for free and there was also free refills. The place is nicely decorated and super clean as expected of newly opened place. Service was friendly. I will definitely come back to try other food",

I was relieved to find that the service here is relatively fast, considering that a previous visit to another Korean restaurant made us almost wilt from the wait for food. I enjoyed their bubbling-hot seafood tofu soup - it was comparable to the great tofu soups I enjoyed in the Korean areas of NYC and northern NJ. The hot stone seafood dish I ordered on another visit was decent, if a bit on the bland side. Banchan or side dishes came with each meal and were flavorful and adequate. The restaurant is conveniently located at the eastern end of the commercial complex on the northeast corner of Dobson and Broadway. Though the commercial complex is huge, it is not busy so parking is never a problem. The restaurant is clean, well-lit and very spacious. That latter aspect made me wonder why, during a quiet mid-afternoon, the server had me seated next to a table where a couple faced me at an uncomfortably close distance, making us awkwardly try to avoid staring at each other in the middle of a big dining space which was nearly empty at that time. If privacy and personal space are important to you, let your server know you would like to be seated accordingly.",

It came with one small fried fish. Yes the fish was soft on the inside and crunchy on the out. Not too salty neither. My server gave me white rice, I told him I ordered purple. He took the white rice and said Oh you wanted purple? You got it. I'm glad we got the right servers this time.. I had 3 different servers all were very nice and checked on me. I dropped my chopstick and my lady server seen or heard and handed me a new one right away. Guys I just wished you could have done this for my birthday when I had dinner with my family here. Well tonight you guys did an awesome job. Please keep up the good work. I would love to be your regular again!",

We get home to Maricopa and open the bag ... 2 beef bimbops (missing the red pepper paste; which everyone knows ties it together). And no bulgogi ...what!!!!! So I call and tell the guy who answers the phone he says 'oh, sorry'.... Crickets ....okay now I'm upset so I say 'what about the refund'... He acts surprised then places me on hold and I can hear him on the phone say to; I can only assume the manager 'you know those black girls that came in earlier with the to go order....'...what!!!! (That's a bit much)...I'm African American and beautiful at that..: after much of a hold he comes back to the phone says ' we'll refund the bulgogi, I think there was a mix up between u and the waiter when u told him what you wanted.... (3x) What!!!!!! ... That guy knew exactly what I wanted I am not know to Korean food or the culture I was offended ... I have a Korean sister whom when I told this too said one word .. Star Korean word for crazy.... How dare they place their mistake in me the customer , especially when there's a receipt to back it up that it was ordered and well understood ... Beware my fellow African Americans you might get treated like a degenerate when dining here ... On another note we had to go buy our own red pepper paste another five dollars to eat the bimbops... At least the oxtail soup came fully prepared ... Thad something I guess ...Signing off the 'Food Pirate....watch for my other undercover food blogs for a food spot near you!",

    "text": "It was interesting since they have multigrain rice here. Even at Hoddoki, they don't serve multigrain rice. It is really nice on how their ban chan is very flavorful. I liked the bulgogi of course! Very sweet, savory, and light. The spicy chicken though, was on fire!! Like it was so good but it was really spicy. It was bloody red(spice color not meat color) and was very flavorful. Their Army base stew was rather salty. If you don't like too much salt, ask if you can have veggies on the side to take out some salt. This place is closer to any Korean bbq restaurant I have ever been to. Compared to Chodang, Koreatown does much better and I would put Koreatown slightly higher on the ranking than Hoddoki even though Hoddoki is more korean(?) I don't know how to state this but, KOREATOWN HAS KPOP RADIO AND I HEARD MY FAVORITE KOREAN ARTISTS PLAYING. It was heaven. Hoddoki doesn't do that. The smell of an authentic Korean restaurant is very obvious. Very enjoyable for Korean bbq lovers. Sorry about my super long review :)",

    "text": "FIVE stars for the food, TWO stars for the service, THREE stars for the ambiance (which I'm actually giving very little weight to in my overall rating).  The Bulgogi hot stone really was perfection... and easily two meals (even for the hungriest Mike)!  Sides included kimchee, fresh broccoli, and seaweed salad (as well as a handful of other items) and all were VERY good (which I typically cannot state for most Korean restaurants that I have been to).  My ONLY problem with Koreatown was the service (or lack thereof).  Maybe we just arrived at a time when they were understaffed... or maybe they just don't care about actually seating and serving customers... but we literally stood at the host area for ten minutes without anyone ever coming up to say hi or tell us it would be a moment or anything.  I could even overlook that if they did not have such an open floor plan where it was evident that servers and other employees in the kitchen made repeated eye contact with us, but yet still ignored us.  And another larger party walked in about five minutes after us and they were commenting on how long THEY were waiting.  We could only laugh because we had already been waiting so long.  It's really not acceptable for this to happen.  If the \"host\" was not in (or maybe was in the bathroom), then someone else (anyone else, really), just needs to come over, make us feel welcomed, and at the very least get us in the queue to be seated.    And then after we were seated, we waiting at least another five minutes before a server came over to us.  I wanted to just order immediately at that point because we had no idea how long it would take to see our server again after that.  Our dishes came out about twelve minutes after ordered them... which is totally acceptable, but that initial wait was almost unbearable.  I am glad we waited because the food was so good... and I will probably be back because of that one reason... but this dining experience could have been SOOO much better.  ***THREE STARS***",

Definitely was packed but the spaciousness of this place made it feel like everyone can be helped and they weren't overwhelmed.   We went with a bunch of friends so we got bulgogi, the spicy pork (teji bilgogi?), all the side dishes (banchan), and my wife got bibimbap and my other friend got some kind of friend rice cause he's white. Everything was sooo awesome! The portions they give you are BIG! Everything tastes amazing, and even the fried rice that my white friend ordered lol, sorry cause I usually don't order fried rice at any Asian place was so tasty!!!! I stand corrected. Maybe I should order fried rice more! Lol   The service was great too!!!! The only thing about this place was that it CAN get a little more pricey than its competitors like Gogi or Cho Dang. However I feel like he quality and portion sizes of this place is worth it!!!! Don't forget to ask for he purple rice, it's way better than the normal white rice they give you! I highly recommend this place to get your Korean fix on!",

After calling around this restaurant said they could sub purple rice in their bibimbap. Not white rice and interesting, I was sold. I ended up ordering the veggie bibimbap with purple rice (because how can you not get purple rice) and an avocado sushi roll. I asked them to make the sushi with purple rice too, because why not. Everything tasted so good and they brought out a bunch of little pickled side dishes before the meal. Might have just been my imagination because the rice looked so pretty but I thought the purple rice tasted better. The veggie bibimbap was really good, they gave us a huge portion. One of my friends taught me to let the rice stick and burn a little instead of mixing it right away. You end up with crispy rice at the bottom of the pot. The sushi roll was massive. It was a lot of delicious food (recommend sharing the bibimbap) for a great price. Will be coming back here again, it's officially our AZ bibimbap spot.",

The waitresses literally run because they are so understaffed, and tables sit uncleaned for a while.  However, the service is kind, although rushed, and they surprisingly come back to fill your water. The stews are really good, and the sides are quite diverse. I really like the army stew hotpot which can feed more than 2 people. The place is quite large and spacious. They also have multiple TVs showing sports and other shows.  There don't seem to be very many Korean options in the Phoenix area, so I will definitely come back here for the food, but expect to wait and don't expect amazing service.",

Apparently, the owner of this restaurant used to be a co-owner of GoGi Korean restaurant located in Chandler. Ah....my expectation is very high now.   They offered Kim Chi in different varieties....much more choices than many other ones ive been to. For appetizer, we ordered dumplings. For entree, we got Kim Chi hot stone rice and Kaibi. Dumpling tastes similar to the one I've had during my travel in Korea. Kaibi (BBQ ribs) was delicious. The meat was tender and juicy. Portion was generous. The Kim chi hot stone isn't as tasty as I thought it would be...not sure what exactly was missing.   Nevertheless, I will most definitely come back here again.",

When we check, we have to wait for a long time to get a box. While the other Americans sit next to us immediately get their check and boxes... I can't help but wonder they don't welcome Asian people?

The makgeolli came in a large bottle and complimented our meal perfectly.  The seafood pancake was delicous and I enjoyed the tender galbi short ribs.

No hostess so we waited until the young waitress led us to one of their many tables.  2 young servers managing the front.  Somewhat open kitchen with about 4 in the back.  Our waitress was nice, friendly and rushing around trying to take care of everything.  Waiter looked like he was just there and not knowing what to do.  We ordered.  Bulgogi, spicy pork belly, pork tofu soup and the Roe Soup.  Food started arriving, slowly, One by One.  Result?  All the dishes we ordered + the banchan (side dishes) were good.  There aren't too many Korean options around here and most have enough flaws that I wouldn't go.  But that seems to be changing with the expected opening of H Mart next year.  Decor:  4 Stars (Big and clean but looks unfinished)  Food:  4 Stars by Arizona standards (About a 3 if in CA or NY)  Service:  4 Stars (friendly and hardworking but they need better organization & management)",

    "text": "When the waiter took our order, he must've thought we were uninitiated in Korean dining.  We ordered the Korean fried chicken (which was a plate of fried wings for $18), the japchae noodles, and the bulgogi beef and mushroom hot pot (or casserole).  We ordered these dishes mostly for the kids and didn't order the more traditional and spicier Korean dishes.  The ban Chan was decent.  The fried chicken was fried well but a little bland.  The japchae was alright maybe a little overcooked and mushy.  But the bulgogi hotpot was way too sweet.  The bulgogi was a generous but thick clump of meat in the middle of the hotpot.  It tasted a lot like the Costco bulgogi (which is very sweet).  We probably should have ordered the soft tofu soup and the spicy stir fried squid if we wanted more of the spicy Korean flavors we were craving. Service was decent, the restaurant is spacious and clean, but the dishes were disappointing and pricey.  If we give this place another try, we will try the other dishes on the menu but will steer clear of the ones we ordered tonight.",

But they were not dry and came with a dark dipping sauce that was good. The soft bean curd soup was a surprise favorite, wish we had ordered more to take home. It tastes great mixed with rice as well. My favorite of the night, besides the never ending tall bottles of Kirin, was the spicy chicken bulgogi. The portion was huge and I ate it for several lunches afterwards. Chicken was moist with onions in a thick spice pepper sauce. The beef bulgogi was a bit sweet for us. I actually took that home and made some kickass sandwiches the next day. The fish, well while edible maybe they should ask if you want it, poor little guy all uneaten and left for scrap at the end of the night. Our service was so-so, they seemed busy even though the place wasn't packed, we had to wave down servers for refills at times. But the food came on time and was hot and fresh, place was clean and very well lit. Will go again.",

Appetizer: Soft shell crab: serving portion was perfect $7.99  Hot stone: Bugolgi (marinated beef) was so tasty like usual with sliced carrots, daikon (white carrot) cucumber, bean sprouts, greens, onions and rice and a fried served on top served in the hot stone bowl. A nice staple dish with all the food groups! :) 2 people can share this as well. $13.99.   Soft Tofu Soup: kimchee - silky soft tofu, kimch, bulgolgi swimming in the mild Red Sea while the egg cooks in the boiling bowl. Let this sit for a little until the bubble subsides. Munch on the mackerel fish while waiting. Soothing soup for he stomach assuming you choose mild. $10.99  Noodles: Soy sauce soba noodles - cold noodle soup served in a large bowl with daikon, carrots, green onions, boiled egg, sprinkled seaweed and ice to keep the noodles cold! $10.99 Seafood Flour Noodle soup-  served with mussels, squid, shrimp, scallops, ridged carrots and zucchini and green onion  $12.99.   Special entree: Pork belly lettuce wraps- comes with steamed soft pork belly,  napa cabbage, slices of garlic and jalapeno, Korean spiced daikon sliced 2 ways for an added crunchiness and Korean sauce (shrimp and soy bean paste) $16.99  Korean bbq: Bulgolgi - the popular of the bbq section is the marinated beef with sauteed sizzling onions and sprinkle sesame seeds.  Great for sharing! $16.99  Korean alcohol: Makgeolli - milky rice wine $7.00  Service is wonderful with cheerful servers and they actually keep track of who came in first. Food is delicious and worth going back several times. Big and spacious area. Tvs are available if you're needing to watch a particular game.",

As I ate my meal not everything in my stone bowl appealed to me so I just pushed it to the side and continued enjoying the deliciousness of the food.  This restaurant has quite a sushi menu, and many patrons were enjoying sushi as I was eating. As the name suggests Korea Town, is very much about Korean food.

Our table ordered beef bulgolgi and spicy chicken bulgolgi, jap chae noodles, and the spicy chirashi bowl. Tons of food. But delicious. The meat was tender and marinated well. The noodles were the perfect addition to it. The chirashi bowl, wow!  I was shocked at how big the bowl was and there was so much sashimi! Well worth the price.  We tried the purple rice, it was good. Not much different Tasting than the white rice.  Only downside is refills were slow. I never got a refill on my water. Then the side dishes they bring out was on the bare minimum side. We had a table of three and barely had 4 bites of each side. Wish they gave us more because I enjoy eating them with my meal.",

    "text": "Trying Korean food for the second time and found Koreatown with good reviews on Yelp.    Ordered the Beef Bulgogi and chicken bulgogi.   Each came with a choice of white or purple rice.  The chicken dish came spicy as ordered but it had no real flavor.  The chicken needed to be marinated or seasoned properly.  It was nothing more than cooked chicken with a sauce on it.  Hubby said he would never order this again.    The beef bulgogi  came with onions which added more flavor.  Therefore, this was a better dish.  But if you order this dish, get ready to tug on the meat since you will find a lot of grizzle.  What I didn't expect was to find that this beef dish would be sweet.  I particularly asked the waiter BEFORE I ordered that I didn't want anything that tasted sweet or that had seaweed.  I spoke to the waiter after I tasted the beef and he told me that the beef was probably marinated with sugar.  I guess I should have said, I don't want any sugar in any part of my dish including the marinade.  As you can guess, the beef dish was too sweet for me to enjoy.   The purple rice which we chose instead of white rice tasted no differently than white rice.  Don't know if nutritionally it is different.    We were served several sides dishes which included bean sprouts (good), cucumber slices (nothing special), kimchee (ok)  broccoli (Ok), sliced fish cakes (ok).   The prices are high:  chicken 14.99 and beef 16.99 if you compare it to chinese fare.   Service was fine and the place was clean.",

The broth had deep flavor difficult to duplicate at home. They added kimchee to the stew which I thought was interesting. However, still had to take a star away due to missing potatoes. Not sure why they were missing, but it would've made the stew so much better. Other items ordered were pork belly lettuce wrap, bulgogi and kimchee pancake. All were tasty. They made improvement on service and food since they opened. The prices are very reasonable; huge portions. Give them a try.",

Second, I love the bonchon (small appetizers) that they offer complimentary. This also means free refills! My favorite however are the entrees. I personally love the seafood tofu soup (comes with scallops, mussel, tofu, shrimp) and would recommend that. It is about $10. I would also recommend the bbq meats, especially the pork bulgogi. It comes out spicy and is amazing. Although the normal beef bulgogi is available, it is not very memorable.   The only reason I knocked it down a star was that the servers were not very attentive. My table's water was not refilled until the check was given. We also had to go up to the counter and ask for our own to go boxes since no one was walking around our area. However, I would still recommend Koreatown because it is one of the best Korean places around.",

    "text": "We were in the mood for some delicious Korean food, and were on our way to Scottsdale from our starting point this evening, which was in Gilbert.   In particular, I wanted some Korean BBQ, and I was salivating at the possibility of enjoying such a wonderful delicacy.  My sense of anticipation was delayed by the accident that occurred on the 60 just before we got to the 101 interchange. I would have to wait a little longer before I could enjoy this evening's dining experience.  Wait? Me?   I immediately cut through the slowing traffic, and made for an exit that would take me through downtown Mesa, and allow me to take the 202 as an alternate route to our ultimate destination.  As we sat at the stoplight by Dobson and Broadway, my wife eyes this particular restaurant called Koreatown.   What a treat! A new place to try, and I don't even have to experience the aggravation of wading through traffic.   When we arrived and entered into this restaurant, we immediately noticed the great amount of patrons dining here. This heightened our expectation due to the fact that an establishment with this kind of draw on a weeknight can't be all that bad!   As we perused the menu, we were presented with a plethora of delectable dishes that we wanted to try.   Self-control definitely went out the door, and we ordered a myriad of dishes. Our reasoning being that we would have plenty of left overs. (Note: This never works, as we always have left overs, and we nearly always throw them all away!)  We definitely wanted to try their Sizzling Beef Bulgogi, Korean Dumplings, Mixed Tempura, and the Fried Rice. Along with the Banchan, this made for a copious amount of dishes to try in one sitting - especially, for just two people.  The Sizzling Beef Bulgogi's aroma, and delicate flavor was simply outstanding. The Korean Dumplings, Mixed Tempura, Fried Rice, and the Banchan made for wonderful accouterments to this splendid meal.   If you happen to be around this area, and are in the mood for some amazing Korean cuisine, this is a great place to satisfy your wanting palate!",

After visiting Sonoran lights we were in the mood for Korean Tofu Soup. To our delight Koreatown was open .   We ordered Kimchi Pancake and two orders of Korean tofu soup I ordered Mixed. The  Seafood tofu soup had small bits of shrimp and 1 or two mussels and clams. The hubs was hoping for more seafood but the flavor was nice.  My tofu soup was \"mixed\" but had the smallest sliver of beef.  I would suggest going for seafood because mixed is a dollar  extra.    Kimchi pancake came out on a large round metal pizza size plate. The kimchi pancake was good but I would prefer crispier. The sauce we didn't care for,  was VERY salty. Actually dipping the pancake in the tofu soup tasted better.   Our waitress tonight was really great. We didn't get her name but kudos to her cause she was carrying all the trays and checking up tables. Also , the space was very clean and spacious and their AC was blasting which is nice for AZ.   PS. ***Koreatown is better than Hodori. Happy there is a korean restaurant with NICE korean people and food!",

    "text": "Sometimes when I go to a restaurant or when I go shopping someplace I'll have a tune in my head but I'll substitute my own words for the original lyrics. Blame it on my musical upbringing. Today I had Funkytown by Lipps-Inc:  Won't you take me to... Koreatown! Won't you take me to... Koreatown (Cue string instruments)  Anyways, Koreatown is in the newly revitalized shopping center on Broadway Rd in the AZ International Market plaza. You can't miss the giant red letters if you are driving there on Broadway. We ate here for dinner tonight. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated with a relaxing atmosphere.   We ordered the beef bulgolgi hot stone bimbimbap and a spicy chicken bulgolgi to share. While we waited for our main entrees our server presented us with a wide selection of banchan such as fish cake, marinated cucumber, kimchi, bean sprouts, and eggplant. My favorites of all of them were the cucumber and eggplant. The kimchi tasted mild and too sweet for my tastes.  The dishes came out and looked amazing. The hot stone bimbimbap smelled heavenly and had a sizzle that was music to my ears. I found it odd that the beef was hidden in a small mound underneath the sunny side up egg. Wouldn't you want to showcase your main meat in your dish? The bowl itself was colorful with lots of vegetables and pleasing to the eye though and the bits of caramelized rice at the bottom of the bowl are always one of my favorite parts of this meal.   The spicy chicken was coated with a red pepper sauce with onions on top and bottom of the dish. Overall, both dishes were enjoyable, but I wish the bimbimbap had more rice to go with it, and the spicy chicken's taste was a little sweeter than what I've had at other Korean restaurants. I did like how a bowl of rice was automatically included with the spicy chicken plate. At other restaurants they charge by the bowl.  Prices for some items seemed a little higher for some dishes, such as the $29.99 casseroles (Meal for 2) but since I didn't order them they might be a ton of food for your money so I can't really pass too much judgement. I was disappointed that my $1.50 soda was not a fountain drink but by the can. I'll be getting iced tea or plain water next time!  I'll come here again if I'm in the area, especially if I'm also shopping at the international market. Overall 3.5/5.",

No one is up front to greet you when you come in and you are left looking around and wondering why no one has even said hi to you. It took over 20 minutes for our order to be taken and for us to get drinks. They messed up our order and we had to cancel it because we were all done eating before the correct order even came back out. The waitress was nice, but I would rather pay higher prices for better service. The owners need to change something here.",

In LA, you can get AYCE galbi for that price and you get japchae for free, not like $7-10 as an appetizer. Anyhoo, between the gf and I, we ended up sharing the pork belly appetizer, bulgogi, and seafood soon tofu. The pork belly was unique, the bulgogi was slightly sweeter than I liked but it was a generous portion and the seafood soon tofu was on point. Was craving for Asian food and this place hit the spot. Panchan can be better though. The Mekong Supermarket carries some that tastes better. Will go back even if it is a bit pricey.",

Found this place , my husband I went there for early dinner.  Very nice simple clean restaurant, laminate table tops, not a  fancy place. Very clean, all the food was excellent, not as spicy as I would have thought or hoped. The waiter a young man, I think his name was Jen ,  answered any questions we might have had about the dishes, was attentive yet not intrusive.  They have  beer and wine, the parking lot is kind of sketchy but I think that's going to change as the other stores start to fill up ,it seems that part of Mesa is finally  getting more populated again Really delicious food definitely some place to try and go back to.  It was definitely more expensive than my husband or I expected.  I did tell the waiter that maybe they should get themselves on doordash or GrubHub LOL One thing I might suggest is that they give better descriptions on the  menu of  the food for those who have little or no familiarity with Korean food.",

We LOVE beef bulgogi as my husband has grown up with some Korean family friends and ate it a lot growing up and the bulgogi here is fantastic! I love the purple rice and soy bean paste that they have available with all the different sides - so delicious! We know we're in the right place when we walk in and there are a lot of Korean patrons at the restaurant. The staff was very friendly and the food came out fairly quick.

    "text": "My wife and I finally checked this place out after passing by it many times, and hanging out at the Aseana Market and Hodori.  This place is much more modern, and Westernized, compared to Hodori.  That is not bad, as it actually has a nice decor.    As far as the food, my wife ordered spicy chicken hot stone pot, and I ordered seafood hot stone pot.  In perhaps a more standard Korean setting, these would be called different versions of bibimbap.  I would say once you get over the Westernized, and less traditional look, you will find the food quality and price to be pretty good.    It is worth noting that you should take your appetite with you when you go.  The portion sizes can be a bit huge, which is why even with two $$ I still call it reasonable.  If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you will have limited choices, though perhaps there are some.    Yes, you can get food that has a real kick as far as spiciness, but the staff will work with you.    What was particularly good was that my wife's teenage nephew, from Vietnam, only been in the USA for less then two months, who was with us, actually was able to eat the seafood hot stone plate.  He can be particular at times as to what food he eats.  The fact that he ate it, and it was not Vietnamese style, means that it was probably pretty darn good.  He found the food to be good, and even wanted to order something to take home.  This tells you something about the food!!!    few things worth mentioning, and some are repeated:  1) If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you will unfortunately have limited choices 2) If you are looking for traditional Korean, it is there, but the food has a bit of a modern and Westernized twist.  It is done tastefully though.   3) The portion sizes are a bit big.  Come with an appetite 4) If you order something like the seafood hot stone plate, it will be slightly bland if you do not add the appropriate condiment sauce.  Not everything is Korean chilli hot!!!  Of course, respect the notation, when it indicates hot and spicy.",

I called in to check if they were open, but no one answered so I played a fortune by driving all the way from Gilbert to Tempe to check this place out.  The restaurant is located in the International Marketplace Plaza, and it may be difficult to point it out correctly if you have never been there. Once I got in, got seated briefly by staff. We were offered drinks right away even though the restaurant was kinda packed at the time.  So far, I have tried some mandatory Korean dishes like Kalbi and Bulgogi, and all I can say is they were prepared nicely. Bulgogi is very soft with full of flavors, Kalbi is a little too fat, but still eatable. You should try the purple rice that goes along with entree. Squid salad is also another must try, and the tofu soup is very delicious (lots of soft tofu and not too salty). The gal who served us was also friendly and attentive. She checks on our table every 15mins to make surr we got what we needed. I think I have found my new favorite Korean place in town.",

But the food and their banchan were just meh. My friends and I ordered Japchae, Kimchi fried rice and Stir fry Squid. I probably wouldn't try any of those again. Their Japchae was on the sweet side - a tad bit sweeter than our usual taste. Actually, everything was a tad bit sweeter. They offer domestic beers (12 oz for 4 bucks - yikes!) and some imported beers like Kirin, big ones for 6 bucks which was a standard price on korean/asian places. They offer wine and sake and soju as well.   I love supporting local businesses. And I wish they thrive in this economy. However I do hope they offer other outstanding dishes that'll make me crave to be back for more. Maybe one day I'll try Korea Town again but different entrees this time. And so consider this a review in progress. ;)",

I was curious to see if this Korean restaurant was any better than Micky D's of Korean food called Hodori. Being THAT Korean who was raised in Ktwn, LA(Cali) on Korean food like it was the only food in existence, it's hard not to be a food snob when it comes to Korean food. Personally, I think Hodori tweaks their flavors for people with limited taste palettes. That ish is mediocre but I guess dead taste buds don't know the real deal.   The presentation of food is what threw me off. Never have I been to a Korean restaurant that actually took their time to make it presentable until now. Definitely left without feeling disappointed. Will be coming back when I visit again.",

It's a big group and 18% tips were added automatically, which is understandable even though they never came back to refill our drinks. However, they wouldn't allow us to separate our checks. They said they \"updated\" their system and the new system won't allow them to separate checks. After back and forth, they magically \"updated\" their system right away and were able to separate the checks. The waiter told us \"I don't know why you guys are expecting the restaurant can separate the checks\". Excuse me? I guess he has never been to another restaurant. At the same time, there is another big group next to us got their checks individually without any issue. When we asked why they can get separate checks, the waitress told us in face, and I quote \"if you are expecting us to separate the checks next time, then you can't be our customer!\" Well, don't worry about that. We will NEVER come back again.",

Kee in known for his masterful interpretation of Korean Bulgogi and nailed it here. (Try the Bulgogi here) OMG!! Tender Calamari and the Seafood soup is spot on.  Today we tried the Softshell crab (A big plus!) and the Spicy Pork Belly, served with beautiful lettuce leafs to wrap with. All the condiments are authentic and bright and flavorful. Clearly I could go on and on!  Of course each meal starts with 8 classic Korean amuse bouche.  Wonderful food!!",

Now, I'm not a Korean food expert, but I thought it was pretty darn good. It was plenty flavorful, and they definitely don't skimp on the seafood (yay!). I got mine at a mild because I'm a wuss, and it was a solid choice. Not too spicy but not completely spice-less. You get all the small side dishes with your meal, and they were also pretty good. Loved the yellow pickled radish and the kimchi, which was a little more \"mellow\" in taste than most kimchi I've had.  I came around 1:30, and it wasn't busy - 5 parties max. The service was fast and very friendly, and the restaurant and bathrooms were clean. They have a sign in the front for lunch rice bowls and other specials, all of which sounded delicious.  One last comment - the place is freezing! I almost ran back out to grab a sweater, but my food came out before I could. The soup warmed me up haha  All in all, I would back to try some of the other stuff. Looking forward to it!",

For some reason, the set up of the restaurant makes me feel like it's a cafeteria. I love the blown up pictures on the walls, makes me excited to know what's to come.   Prices are typical for Korean food for dinner.   Pros:  + they have purple rice  + spicy pork bulgogi was DELICIOUS! Spicy with a hint of sweetness. Can eat this all day.  + seafood soon tofu soup came out boiling --- LOVE my soups being hot and they gave a piece of fried fish on the side with the soup which I enjoyed a lot  Cons: - kimchi fried rice was bland and there was no fried egg on top ): this makes me very sad!  - seafood soon tofu soup was not soupy at all. Not sure why the soup was so thick but I didn't have any broth to eat with my rice ...   Overall I would come back to try other things. My tumic did leave happy and full!",

The hot Barley tea was just right because I was cold.   The service was very fast and efficient and our side dishes were served immediately. There was kimchee, fish cake, cucumbers, sprouts, broccoli, pickled radish, potato and zucchini.   The soup had four large pieces of oxtail in the soup. We ordered sesame oil/salt to complement the pork belly which was served with onions. The Pork Bulgogi with onions was ordered mild and was not spicy at all and had good flavor. The Seafood Pancake was light and crispy.  We had a party of four and there were leftovers. My father-in-law absolutely loved the purple rice. I believe it was a rice/bean mixture.

But once you get inside its actually really big. I went on a Tuesday night and I was really surprised that it was busy. I saw a lot of families like eating here. I ordered the spicy pork belly and my boyfriend ordered the Korean fried chicken. For dinner time if you order off the Korean BBQ menu they give you the side dishes that come with it. The food was okay. I tried some of the chicken from my boyfriend it was not to bad either. It had like a sweet taste when you ate it. I also like have they gave you French fries. The waitress was very nice. She made she to explain what was in the food. This is place of more of a one time thing for my preference.",

The menu is large, and the server was really nice as well as some other staff to make suggestions. The food is fresh, and brought quickly. What wonderful flavors. And the portions are huge. Another thing I noticed was there were a good amount of Asian's there eating as well. I alway use this as a litmus test as to whether the place is authentic. We will be coming back many times I'm sure. There are so many other items I need to put into my mouth.",

The sauce was way too thick on the spicy and the soy garlic flavor was just meh. The fries were not great either. The beef tongue was so chewy, but the flavor was good. The saving grace for the three stars was the fried rice, gyoza, and seafood pancake. Those were actually very good. The fried rice was so flavorful and the potstickers were nice and crispy. The pricing was pretty expensive too, so overall I don't think it's worth the price.",

Or I guess I shouldn't exactly say little, since the interior of the restaurant is very spacious. No signs of overplayed corporate design here! If you're planning on arriving in a large group, they will definitely have little to no trouble accommodating. The menu contains your typical Korean fare such as kimchi, bulgogi, bibimbap, and plenty of seafood options. After much debate I settled on ordering the seafood hot stone and boy am I glad that I did. All of the flavors blended together perfectly! Fried egg, shrimp, and veggies are a match made in heaven...and all the other elements were just as great.   The only drawback is that because the dish is brought to the table extremely hot, some of the rice towards the bottom tends to become stiff. But the portion sizes are huge anyway, so it's not the end of the world!",

    "text": "I was very indecisive on what to order. I asked the server what was the seafood in the seafood hot stone and she tells me that it's scallops shrimp and squid. When I received the food, I notice that it was shrimp and squid. I try to look for the scallop and it was not there. I was disappointed because I ordered it because I wanted the scallops. I told the server that there were no scallops in my food and she said she will go back and check. She comes back later telling me that they do not have scallops and if I wanted more shrimp or squid. Ok... I should've been told this earlier. So I was disappointed and I was like it's fine. I go to mix up my food and I notice that the rice on the bottom is very hard. It's not like fried rice hard. It's like the rice that gets stuck on the rice scooper and you leave it on for a day. Literally that hard. At this point I am already getting real frustrated. There were no scallops and I wasn't told before I ordered it. The rice is un-eatable. The shrimp and squid is like boiled. No sauce in the dish. So I wanted to change the food. The server tells me that the hard rice is the concept of this dish... BUT WHO IN THE WORLD CAN EAT THIS TYPE OF RICE? It's harder than chips. It's like eating egg shells.... I do have the say the server is really nice and was very helpful on offering to change the dish. I ordered the tofu soup with oysters. The soup was good. It came with rice and a small fried fish. The fish was good and crispy. Their portions are big. One thing I like about this place is that their service is really good. The other food were really good as well. The seafood hot stone was just not my thing. I was not able to take a picture of my other food.",

I can't imagine what the dinner menu would be all about.  There's something about Korean food that's very difficult to describe. It's sweet and spicy yet not overwhelming and the flavors really stay with whatever protein you were having. They use on namely cuts of beef and make them special. From, the richness of short ribs, to the flank but they're cut so strangely but it's hardly recognizable. However the beef is so tender and so sweet that it makes your dining experience all that much better. I had the Galbi, which is nothing more than grilled beef and rice however it taste so special that I could've eaten 10 bowls of the Galbi.  Service, well yes it was excellent the people there are very sweet and the restaurant is very clean. Like I said before I leave this area I'm going to have to go buy one more time and get something totally different.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Koreatown. The restaurant was easy to find with easy access to free parking. The interior was very modern with high ceilings. I knew this place was going to be good because the menu was translated into Korean.  We went on a Tuesday evening and it was relatively busy. I went with 18 people and we were all able to sit together at our reserved time. The waitress was very attentive and speedy. She did a phenomenal job taking everyone's orders and not screwing a single one up! Props!   Note that Korean restaurants usually bring out the appetizer with the main course, or at least this has been my previous experience with Korean restaurants. They brought out the small complimentary appetizers with the meals, including the bean sprouts, fish cakes, squid, cucumbers, fried fish, and etc. Additionally, I had ordered a seafood pancake for a large appetizer, which also came with the meals. The seafood pancake comes on a large plate, cut into 8 pieces. On the side, they have the seafood pancake \"very salty\" sauce. Some people liked the sauce, others thought the seafood pancake was better without the sauce.   Under Korean BBQ, I had the pork bulgogi. This comes with a side of white sticky rice. It was spicier than my liking but still pretty good. Otherwise, this dish was delicious and was well presented on the sizzling plate. Pro tip #1: don't touch the metal part of the sizzling plate - it's hotttt. Pro tip #2: If you try anything bulgogi, ask for a side of lettuce. It's usually complementary. I like to wrap the pork and rice in the lettuce.   Needless to say, I had plenty of leftovers (enough for two meals). Korean meals are generally pricey in nature and this place was no different. I would love to go back and try some of their hot stones dishes.",

Won't you take me to Koreatown? Won't you take me to Koreatown? Won't you take me to Koreatown?  Koreatown is a spacious Korean eats hot spot that is fairly new.  The place is located in the same shopping mall as the International Market where you can find almost anything!  My first thought of Koreatown was the signage wasn't that great and plus you really couldn't see if from the street.  The place itself however is very large and can seem to seat up to 50 plus and great for large groups.    For starters I ordered the Japchae; sweet potato starch glass noodles fried with vegetables and beef.  To my surprise this starter was quite large and can definitely be an entree if you love this dish.  Slippery noodles with a prominent sweetness to it, while the vegetables provided a hint of crunch.  Overall, my favorite bite of the night!  For my entree I went with the  Chirashi sushi bowl; pretty much sashimi cut in cubes served with a salad.  The dressing came on the side which I appreciated; it was sweet with a hint of spiciness.    Overall, my experience was great.  Korean food is starting to pop up around the valley and they keep getting better!  Koreatown is well received in my books and definitely a spot I'll keep attending since the menu is meant for a foodie to explore! - Enjoy!",

I had the bulogogi beef and my husband had the spicy chicken. Had lots of flavor and it was balanced and not too overpowering when it came to the spices. They give you a bunch of different tiny dishes with things such as fish tofu and cucumbers etc. The food are served in a hot clay pot type dish. They give you a lot so one serving could possibly fill 2-3 people up! I like that the environment of the place felt very simple but relaxing. The staff are very attentive and always come by to see how you're doing. It would have been cool if it were one of those cook while you eat type BBQ places but i dont mind it much. I like the place and will definitely be coming back! Kinda pricey, but worth it to come once in a while. :)",

Soon Do Bu was served boiling hot, raw egg cooking on top, and the most perfect fried fish on the side. Stir fried kimchi and pork and the galbi were so good, I can't wait to go back. Plus the soju mixes were fantastic.",

Every single time the same story....outstanding food but lousy service. Once you order(it takes them a long time to come to you so when they do come for your drink order also order your meals at the time) you won't see the server come back to ask how you're doing, offer refills, or just a courtesy check up. I had to ask another server for a refill and guess what.....she never returned. Finally we were done eating and sat for 15 minutes before I grabbed someone there for our check. Just know before you go here the service sucks.",

We lived in SF and had amazing Korean food and haven't had anything near as good since then... until now.  I highly recommend this place.",

She picked up their orders and provided them drinks. I'm not sure why she didn't ask us for our drink orders  or why she didn't serve us. She was not rude or unkind we were just simply forgotten after seated. It was not busy at the time we arrived. I was disappointed as I was very exited to try this new place. We decided to leave and we did let her know we were not satisfied. She apologized and offered to serve us then, but at that point we no longer felt comfortable. I will say I was the only Hispanic person in the restaurant and I felt like we were not being served because of that purpose. It made feel sad that would happen as this restaurant has such wonderful reviews by diverse people. :/",

We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the servers were here.  One time, they made a mistake (which really could have been my fault too) but they offered us a free dessert.  You don't see this often in other asian restaurants.  Anyhow, aside from the service, the food is phenomenal.  We go here just about every other week.  They also have a lot of seating so it's great for large parties, which we have often.  They also have a lot on their menu to choose from and we haven't been disappointed with anything we tried.  My favorite plate so far is the spicy pork belly, bbq chicken, and kimchi fried rice.  This is our new favorite restaurant.  Highly recommend it to everyone.  But please don't all go at once because I don't want to have to wait in line :)",

I am from Orange County in California and have fallen in love with Korean BBQ. After yelping Korean food, this one seemed pretty good and relatively close to KBBQ so we gave it a go. It was delicious.   Ordered the Bulgogi Beef BBQ and my friend ordered the flour noodles with chicken. We also order veggie fried rice and it was amazing. All of it had incredible flavors. Every bite I couldn't help but mention how great it was! The price isn't too much because you get what you pay for. There was plenty of left overs. The menu has lots of options for all kinds of taste pallets.   We will definitely be returning and telling our friends about this place. This place is a hidden gem!",

I ordered the pork belly and squid on hot plate. The flavor was similar to that of the Vietnamese caramelized pork belly, only richer. It's a comfort food dish for sure. Next up is the spicy chicken. The heat gets to you about 3 bites in, but it doesn't get to overwhelmingly hot. It was just the right amount of heat. Saving the best for last, I give you the caviar bowl. If you eat with your eyes, then this bowl is a crowd pleaser for sure. It's stunningly beautiful, healthy, and beyond delicious. All dishes are prepared in the kitchen, so you can just sit back and enjoy.  A great addition to the Mesa food scene. Bon appetit!!!",

Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. We received some of the best food and service that we have ever had! Our waiter took such good care of us. He kept our banchan and water full, answered our questions, took our cheesy Valentine's photo, and even took a celebratory shot of soju with us to help polish off our bottle before we left. So friendly! The food was insanely delicious, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! I'm hooked. We had such a great time celebrating Valentine's Day here.",

Exterior: It is located in an international market area with several stores and restaurants catering to the Asian community. From the outside, the restaurant looks very dark because the windows are covered.  Interior: From the inside, the windows are covered with a film because the restaurant faces west. There is a lot of space so large groups are welcome and I saw several while I was there. Very clean from the moment I entered.  Staff: Wonderful. I had never had Korean food before and the wait staff walked my table through options and made suggestions. They also gave us warning on a dish that was cold as some guests has previously thought it would be hot (noodle dish). Such good service.  Food: I went specifically to try the hot stone soup because it was a featured dish on the Master Chef show. I had the spicy pork and it was very good. Also had the potato noodles and the Korean dumplings. I would eat all of these again. I also saw several other dishes I would try again.  The fact that native Asians ate here and the fact that I overheard a few other tables talking about when they had previously gone, I am definitely wanting to eat here again and show it to others.  Go with friends and split several dishes. Such a great experience.",

My hubby agreed that we'll definitely be going back, he's not huge on Korean food but he really enjoyed it.   We ordered the Jap Chae and Spicy Pork Bulgogi which were both very flavorful. I love that you get big sized portions for the cost, the Jap Chae is an appetizer but it's HUGE. They were out of purple rice but that's okay, maybe next time...  The waitstaff was extremely pleasant, and kind. They got slightly busy so we felt a little neglected but the delicious food and kind staff made up for that.",

I was warned that it was for 2-4 people, but I wanted to give it a shot and knew it'd be great leftovers.  The stew was perfect - so comforting on a cold day, and the leftovers were awesome for days.   The other night I came back and got a tofu soup, which was great, and the short ribs. The short ribs were a very generous portion and really well cooked.   The only thing not very memorable about this place is their banchan. I'm not sure if it changes depending on supply, but the dishes are on the bland side. They're good if you're just looking for light palate cleansers, but if you're more used to elaborate dishes, this restaurant doesn't have a lot of frill. I definitely recommend coming here, especially if you happen to be looking for a spot that could accommodate a larger group. This restaurant is large and the space is open.",

I probably would not go back to this place since I have been to better ones in the Phoenix and surrounding areas.",

I need to echo another reviewer's perfect representation of the atmosphere: \"open and clean...\"  Typically my wife leaves the more authentic Asian fare to me and my friend Brian. The other day I wheedled her into a trip to the awesome little Asia of Dobson Road and Broadway. And stepping into Koreatown I verified they had wine and then waved her in.  A friendly face greeted us at the door and showed us to a table. A Cass and a chard materialized shortly thereafter. We were on our way. We ordered the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), Spicy Pork Bulgogi hot stone pot, and some fried rice. Kimchi and 9 other pickled appetizers came. I'm a huge kimchi and bulgogi fan, been that way since I lived with a Koren family when I was in 9th and 10th grades. I was truly in heaven within 5 minutes of sitting. And then the meal came. Fantastic, all of it. Once again I lament my limited stomach capacity and my waning metabolism. Really looking forward to trying other dishes.  The wife says we're going back. The universe is loving me. Mind you, this is the same wife that makes me sleep on the couch when I eat kimchi. No gonna question or argue.  Oh happy day.",

Very generous portion of rice, vegetables, kimchi, spices, and oil. It came out boiling hot! If you can wait -and I know that's asking a lot- let the rice on the bottom crisp up a little from the hot stone before you eat. Scrape up those crispy rice pieces and savor it. The dish tastes better the longer you stir as well. Good thing chopsticks make you eat slower. They also have several Korean appetizers that they bring to your table. My favorite was the pickled cucumbers.   I only tried one other dish at the table: kimchi cold noodles (Kimchi Bibim Guksu), which was also great.   They ever brought us complimentary tiramisu cake! I didn't try it, but those that did, loved it.   Highly recommend this place! I want more NOW!",

My husband and I were greeted promptly and warmly and shown to our table.  There was K-pop playing in the background, not too loud to be overbearing, but loud enough for us to enjoy and for my husband to sing along without being noticed ;)  Our waitress brought us our menus quickly, and she was very friendly and helpful. The menu had a lot of choice, and looked pretty delicious. My husband couldn't turn down the K-BBQ and ordered the barbequeue pork belly. I ordered the seafood tofu soup. I liked that I could choose the level of spice. I chose SPICY!  The waitress brought out a large number of side dishes for us. There was a lot of variety and they were very generous. They were delicious!  Our meals came out quite quickly, both with large bowls of steamed rice. My seafood tofu soup arrived bubbling hot with a fried fish on the side, which was cooked to perfection. Fried long enough to be crispy, but not to long as to make the flesh on the inside dry. My husband's barbequeue pork belly arrived on a hot plate and was sizzling hot. It smelled amazing!  I am glad I ordered spicy, since I do like a bit of heat. The silken tofu was smooth and delicate, and there was a lot of seafood in my soup. The broth was fiery red in color and it tasted divine! Well seasoned and flavorful.  There was so much food, that we could not finish, but our waitress offered us a container so we could take it home.  Service was fantastic. The staff is attentive, friendly and genuine and did not bother us too much.  I am definitely going to come back - there is so much on the menu I would like to try, and I would definitely have the seafood tofu soup again.  Highly recommend this place if you are after some authentic and delicious Korean food in a restaurant with great service.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Bring an appetite. If you like Korean food, you'll love this place. If you've never had Korean food, stop reading and go try this place out!  This place is unassuming from the outside but it is quite the gem! I went here for lunch with my gf and two of our friends.   I had the *Bulgogi Hot Stone* and my gf had the *Bibim Neng-Myum / Galbi combo*. We also got a seafood pancake as an appetizers. Some general thoughts: - Portions are huuuge! This was a big plus. - Lunch came with complimentary banchan (Kimchi and other pickled appetizers). I was not expecting banchan, so it was a nice surprise. - Service was prompt and there were no issues finding a table for Sunday lunch, even though this restaurant seems to be pretty popular from other reviews.  I have only been here once, but I really liked my bulgogi hot stone. If you haven't had much Korean food before, it's basically a griddle with rice, vegetables, and Korean BBQ beef topped with a raw egg that cooks in the hot griddle. The beef was extremely tender and packed with flavor! I wasn't allowed to try my gfs dish, but she said she really liked it. The only note on her dish is that the noodles are served cold in this traditional Korean dish (in case you were expecting something warm) and the Galbi was served on the side. When she ordered, she wasn't sure if the meat would be part of the noodle dish or separate. This was definitely not an issue, just something to point out.   The seafood pancake app was delicious. In retrospect, we probably should not have ordered it since the lunch portions were so big, but I can totally work that off at the gym later. But since Koreatown is on the way to my gym, I might as well stop there again for lunch...  I would, and will likely go again. Eating Korean food is basically a part time job for me and this definitely hit the spot.",

We overheard our server dismissing a group of two who had arrived at 8:40; the people were pretty confused.

But then.... no refills (and the food was spicy), no check in, and we had to flag someone down for our check. They weren't insanely busy.

Anyways, we were close by and decided to try.   It's in an unassuming shopping center. There isn't any wow factor when walking up to it. Very unassuming. We walk in and wow. Didn't expect this. Very well decorated with wooden tables, black chairs, very modern looking and very clean.   We started off by sharing the Jap Chae which is clear noodles with marinated beef, vegetables, and onions. Surprised tasty. Really good. Most clear noodle dishes I have are not too tasty but they were outstanding. Really enjoy it.   They also bring out these small dishes with different pickled and kimchi based veggies. Really good. Enjoyed this too.   My son's favorite of the Hot Stone dishes so I ordered the eel hot stone. It's comes in a thick stoned dish that they make really hot and it even cooks the dish while you eat. Anyhow, comes with rice, different veggies, large piece of eel, and I sunny side up egg. Really good. It doesn't look that big but it's really filling. Eel cooked perfectly and everything just came together really well. Loved it.   My wife and son got the bulgogi Hot Stone. Same as mine but with bulgogi Beef. They really loved it. Very tender.   The service was pretty good. One thing I noticed the night that we were there, It was all young guys as servers and in the kitchen. They were good. Took our orders, got our drinks and continued to refill our cups. Just not a lot of friendly service. Just doing your job. I'm used to this in Asian restaurants. So not a big deal to me.   So overall great food, actually loved the food, really good service, nice atmosphere and actually clean bathrooms too.   This just might turn out to be one of my favorite Korean restaurants. So for sure I will be back. Enjoy we sure did",

I've gone several times now, and the food and service have been pretty good, and normally I would give it 4 stars. However, I will not be attending in the future as well as others that I know due a recent, extremely unprofessional experience.  My mother had gone to Koreatown for a lunch with her friend and decided that she wanted a soup dish. She picked the order, however, the waitress had stated something that she did not understand. She stated that she just wanted the particular soup and if they did not have it, to let her know. The waitress then took her order.  When the order came out, it was not what she had ordered, and when she stated that it was not the correct order, the waitress snapped at her, behavior to what was described as \"vicious\". The waitress then stated that if she wanted the initial soup that my mother ordered, that she would have to pay for both dishes. At this point she had lost her appetite and wanted to leave, but they made her friend pay for the food (her friend took their dish to go).  I was told this story and called the restaurant the next day to a staff member so that I could figure out exactly what had happened, and the staff member had stated that the manager was out and that they will get back to me. It's been over a week since I called and it's pretty clear to me that customer concerns are not their priority.  Consumer experience is non-existent. Visitor beware.",

When I got it, the bowl was full of mixed greens and a couple of pieces of sashimi. I thought more must have been in there, but there was not. I asked the waitress who talked to the chef, who relayed to her that it is the same amount he always puts in. I explained how I come all the time and I'd never received the dish with less than half of the amount of sashimi. She said she couldn't do anything about it (which is not her fault!) There was an opportunity to resolve this situation and it was not. We got my sister's order to go and left. I will not be bringing my friends or family here anymore, nor recommending it to anyone. I will miss going to Koreatown.",

Galbi tang: One of my favorites. broth is good and comes in a large silver bowl. I can't even finish it.   Boo Dae Jigae (army soup): I like spam, sausage, rice cake, with ramen noodles. It's a large size hot pot so make sure you have a party of three or more to finish the pot.  Dae ji bulgogi (spicy pork): Really good! Must have! The meats are cut to good size portions with a slight kick to it.  Bulgogi:  Has flavor to it, it doesn't have a dull taste to it.  Soju: Pretty good selection. The flavor soju's are good but they have a slightly lower alcohol content. I believe it's around 13%. I'll stick to chamisul (+20%). Can't forget about Somek (soju + hite = 1 shot)   Waitresses and Waiters are super friendly. Seahawks were playing a game on a Sunday, the waiter was able to put the game on for us.   I will return to try their other selections of food : )",

We got the spicy pork hot pot (bibimbap) and pork tofu soup (spicy level hot). The accompanying side dishes were bland, nothing special. A small fried fish came with the tofu soup, which was nice... but not enough to make up for the bland tofu soup and the super fatty pork belly in the soup. The bibimbap was decent and vegetable variety was a plus. We usually go to another Korean restaurant in Mesa, but decided to try Koreatown because of the good reviews. We will not be returning.",

This place has become one of my favorites and at this point, it might top Hodori which is saying a lot. The place is bigger and cleaner than all the Korean bbqs in Arizona and everyone here speaks perfect English so that the majority of my friends aren't as intimidated when they try to decipher the menu. Before you take a seat, make sure to take a look at their specials on the menu. It's probably the one thing that differentiates them from other places since they have specials like octopus, noodles, different types of desserts, etc. The portion sizes are on par with everyone else (maybe not the galbi) but everything has always come out fast, hot and so delicious that I can't complain. Also, it's pretty much mandatory that you have alcohol with Korean bbq so if it's not your birthday, ask for the flavored soju. Our server recommended grapefruit and dear lord, that stuff goes down like Capri-Sun. It is amazing and you'll be in such a fantastic mood that you won't even realize that you've stayed past closing and now you're mildly slow and happy yet confused because the servers are now begging you to leave. Whoops.   To be honest, all the Korean food in AZ tastes the same. They all use similar marinades and have pretty much the same menus so if someone was to recommend you a place, it would more than likely be based on service and environment so I definitely recommend this place, especially for first timers! Koreatown is daebak, at least for Arizona standards.",

Companion and I went for lunch, as we both are very fond of Korean food. On entering, we noticed quite a few people eating their lunch there - hopefully a good sign of food to come.  We were seated quickly, and given menus. Our server explained that they had only been open for several weeks and that many of the recipes were from the owner's family.   After ordering soft drinks, we placed an order for dac bulgagi, which is a variant on the regular bulgagi in that it is made with chicken instead of beef. While we were waiting we were brought about ten banchan or appetizers that we could either snack on then or eat with the meal. We did a bit of snacking and saved the rest for the meal.  The banchan was excellent, and particular kudos for the kimchi, which is made in house. I could have easily finished several portions of it.  In due time, the main course arrived - a large platter heaping with steaming hot dac bulgagi. I've eaten this dish in many places and this was some of the best I have had the pleasure of eating. The sauce was obviously homemade.  It was hard to finish the pile of chicken, but we made a valiant effort and in the end took a small box with us.   The owner visited our table to check on us and to let us know that these were his family's recipes. While we did not have room to eat another bite, the flavor and quality of the food will encourage me to visit again and try some other dishes.  4 stars for good service, good food, and cleanliness.",

The pork pieces were huge in the soup but has huge bones too making it a bit harder to eat.

Expediency of service  was not an issue as we arrived at 5:00pm on a Tuesday and we were the only party at the time.  We ordered Cod Roe Soup, Pork Belly Lettuce Wrap, Beef Fried Rice and Calamari.  Overall the food dishes were decent to good.  Banchan side dishes were good but too sparse.  Calamari was excellent.  Cod Roe Soup was flavorful but not spicy enough for my taste and portion is smaller to other places in town considering the cost.  Fried rice was good and beef was cooked perfectly.  Pork belly lettuce wrap was tasty and good but we ran out of lettuce before pork belly, side stuff that came with this dish also ran out before pork belly.  We specially asked for purple rice but got none, waitress either completely forgot or jus didn't hear us...it's wasn't like they were busy.  Overall, I give this place 3 1/2 stars but took away half for not getting purple rice.  I may come back at some point to try other dishes.",

We decided to get the stone pots kalbi/bulgogi and the Korean BBQ platter bulgogi. The waiter came back and he started to wipe his nose repetitively, while he's sniffling, with his fingers. Gross! Then proceeded to take our food order. I really didn't want to eat anything but I was here with friends.  The Kalbi stone pot came with 3 pieces of meat, the bulgogi stone pot probably a cup of meat. The bulgogi platter could serve 2 people it had a lot of meat. Everything tasted good! Overall, the place was clean, service was fast and the food was good. The management just needs to train the server on table etiquette.",

I don't read korean well enough to read just the Korean but the english was odd enough that I had to ask if the soup was jjigae. Waitress also didn't ask how spicy I wanted it or what rice I wanted. I didn't notice until they brought it out. The jjigae was mild, not even close to hot. And I was really excited for purple rice and had to settle with white.

    "text": "I have not had Korean food before but the food we had at Koreatown was amazing, and paired with the service, it was definitely a 5-star experience! My fiance & I had gotten here at 7:30p on Saturday night. There was no wait time, but most of the tables around us were full. We were greeted immediately, seated, and given a chance to look over the menu. Our server came by and asked if we had ever been to Koreatown. After we let him know that we had not and that we had actually never had Korean food either, he gave us a quick run-down of the menu.  I had seen multiple photos from my Yelp friends of the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi so I ordered that and upon inquiring if it was very spicy our server suggested getting it medium-spicy, so I agreed. My fiance got the Bulgogi Hot Stone per recommendation of our server.  The small dishes that we were given to try out while we waited were very interesting. I didn't realize all the items were served cold but they included kimchi, pickled radishes, zucchini, sprouts, fish cakes, broccoli, potatoes, and squid. I liked the kimchi, zucchini, and sprouts, the other items were also okay.  When our food was delivered to us, both of the dishes were sizzling and smelled phenomenal! The Chicken Bulgogi dish quickly became one of my favorites after only a couple of bites! The sauce had a very unique flavor and tasted great in combination with the caramelized onions and the side of rice. I think that medium spice was perfect for me just because I don't eat super spicy food, but I could myself enjoying it with the normal amount of spice as well just because the sauce seemed a bit on the sweeter side. The hot stone was different in that the rice was served on the bottom (instead of on the side) with meat, veggies, and an egg on top, but sauce on the side. Our server told my fiance that he would recommend adding as much sauce as he wanted into the pot, mixing the contents together, and waiting just a couple of minutes so that the heat from the stone would complete cooking the egg. My fiance really enjoyed his dish as well and commented that in this case, more sauce was better.  The portion size of the Korean BBQ was big enough for two to share, but we liked trying two dishes out and taking some leftovers home. If I had to make a recommendation, I would probably suggest getting the Korean BBQ style over the hot stone only because the stone was so hot that it kept cooking the items. The flavors were so good in both however, that it really is personal preference.  Our server, as previously mentioned, was really helpful and came by to ask if we we needed anything a couple of times. He was prompt in taking our order, bringing us the check, and so forth, as well. Definitely a 5-star place in my book, I will be back!",

Let's start with the ban chan.  8 dishes, each average at best.  They put a little extra seasoning on the dak kwang, the kimchi is fermented a little longer than your usual place, but it's all still pretty average.  Ordered the naeng myun and kalbi combo (kal naeng), and an order of the kalbi dolsot bibimbap.  The naeng myun was alright.  Had to ask for mustard and vinegar to doctor it up a little and even after that, noting special.  The kalbi on the side was pretty thick cut, not too sweet, but there was quite a bit of fat on them.  Also average.  The dolsot bibimbap's main annoyance is that they don't cut up the kalbi - it's left in big pieces on top which looks nice, but makes it harder to eat.  It seemed like you had to add a lot more of the gochu jang sauce here than at other places.  Also, in comparison to say, Hodori, where they give you an extra side bowl of soup, no extras here.  Again, nothing here was bad.  But nothing was amazing either.  We'll be back to try the gamja tang and compare it to Gogi and try some other stuff, but for what we had, just an average Korean meal.",

The server was kind enough to give us more. We ordered the Korean dumpling hot pot, spicy pork belly and hot stone bulgogi which had rice and mixed veggies as well. All dishes were very authentic and flavorable. My brother's favorite was the pork belly and it was pretty spicy but not overwhelming or painful. They also served white rice and purple rice which has more of a brown rice texture.   Lots of leftovers to take home for future lunches and dinners and we will try this place again. We think it'll be good fro groups!",

Me and my boyfriend ordered kalbi, mixed soon tofu and bossam (pork belly lettuce wraps). The broth was beautiful and Spicey for the soon tofu, packed with so much protein. The kalbi was deliciously marinated and sizzling hot when it came out. The bossam was tender and the fresh ingredients that came along were so lovely. Also, the 8 side dishes that came first were fantastic, it was my first time seeing spicey marinated squid within the options and it was amazingg.   By the end of it we were so delighted and full but it didn't stop just yet, the awesome waiter brought out a complimentary piece of cake, ahaha. We could not resist! This place was incredible and we'll definitely be back!",

Give me that boiled pork belly, the salted napa cabbage, the salted shrimp paste, and the radish salad any day and I'll be a very happy girl! Wash it down with some soju and I'm ready to punch the day in the neck! I almost wish they gave out whole cloves of garlic instead of slivers but I suppose you can always ask for more. Also on the spectrum of tastiness, I forgot the exact name but it's also listed under \"Specialty Entrees\" on the menu is the something-glazed salmon. It's in a sweet and slightly spicy (more mild than anything) sauce. The salmon and accompanying daikon is cooked to perfection. I do wish the skin stayed crispy for a contrast in texture as it gets incredibly soggy while bathing in the glaze sauce but it's not bad. I recommend eating your meal with the purple rice as its better for you! The banchan served is standard as well.   Prices are decent, portions are good, the place is spacious and clean, and service is wonderful.  I'll definitely be back again.  I want that Seafood Hot Pot!",

    "text": "Korean food is something that is new on my radar and this place just happens to be right down the street from work. They were happy to help me select what to order and checked on me several times to make sure everything was fine during my visit. YES!  Inside is very clean and there are plenty of tables for those hungry appetites. The decorations are pleasant with some nice modern touchs. They even have a couple of TV's to zombie out on while you're eating your meal.  Ordered the Chicken Bulgogi and had them make it extra spicy. This was my first attempt at this type of dish and it came with a side of Purple Rice. It was very good and the portion was rather large. The sauce was a little on the sweet side. Maybe this is normal. This is a dish the you could easily share with someone special.  Went with the Hot Stone Beef Bulgogi on my next visit and fell in LOVE. It arrived at the table still cooking in a very hot bowl and the sounds and smells were most excellent. They give you some type of red sauce in plastic bottle to squeeze on the top and it really took the dish to the next level.  Their colorful menu is packed with several types of appetizers and entrees. They even serve a good selection of alcoholic beverages for those who wish to partake and get crazy. They also have many yummy non-alcoholic beverage for those who are driving or just do not wish to get sloshed.  Located in the new Asian complex on the NE corner of Broadway and Dobson. Look for me here around lunchtime right when they open. Can't wait to try out some of their Pork Belly dishes and maybe even splurge on some killer Seafood. ORDER UP!  4.5 STARS",

    "text": "I can't get the sound of the sizzle and incredible aroma from the burning hot plate of spicy chicken bulgogi out of my mind! I'll share more on that later, but first let me share some tidbits about dining at Koreatown.  The restuarant is located in a very indistinct strip mall that has been mostly empty until recently (I saw a new pho shop and food market in the same complex). There is a private parking lot and plenty of parking, however I didn't notice bike parking near the restuarant itself.  The interior is casual and clean, with lots of photos of what the dishes look like throughout the restaurant. There was plenty of seating to accomodate a large group or smaller tables for a couple to enjoy dinner. Sound carried pretty well here and there TVs with sports on, so know that it is not a fancy establishment.  The staff was very polite and helpful. They are very proud of the food they serve and were very informative in thier description of the dishes and category of dishes. I was greated immediately upon entering and seated promptly. My waiter offered to help with suggestions and knew a lot about the dishes offered. I decided to go with the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, which was served on a platter which sizzled at my table for a bit while I was busy digging in. The chunck of chicken were small enough to easily be picked up with chop sticks yet not get dried up due to the hot plate. It was a very savory sauce that was a bit sweet and very very spicy. While the level of heat was high, the taste really stood out as the chicken was flavorful and juicy. It came with 5 small sides including a marinated eggplant side, cucumber, beansprouts with spicy condiments, kimchee and one more I cannot remember. It also came with a serving of purple rice that was sticy and flavoful. The waiter explained that it is cooked with a type of bean that gives the rice its purple color. I was glad he suggested I try it instead of plain rice. Note you are given only chop sticks here--I can eat with them so I didn't ask for a fork and I am not sure if the do or don't have forks.  I was offered additional sides and asked for some kimchee to go. They brought over a box (one order at $14.99 can easily feed 2) and I took some leftovers for my hubby to enjoy. They gave me a whole small container of the kimchee and I wasn't charged for it so I left a hefty tip. I saw the Bimbimbap and several of the soups come out and they smelled and looked GREAT. I will definitely be back and I will be sure to bring my friends with me.  A shout out to Mark R. who suggested this location. Your review was spot on!",

I ordered the spicy stir fried squid and the brazen salmon---salmon came out first. It tasted okay, but can taste a lot of burnt ingredients, but it was edible. The stir fried spicy squid came out sizzling in a hot plate almost choking me with the pepper aroma. It tasted like a jar of Korean pepper paste with some sugar, that was what I tasted. It was very hard for me to finish my meal---so I guess I will never come here again (really yummy Korean food I find best in MN is Dong Yang--located inside the grocery store---fresh and very flavorful without the out of the jar taste).   My experience inside the restaurant, I was seated immediately. I was the second table and ordered my dish before table 3 and table four, but got my food last. Not cool.",

The waitress was very kind and she told me Koreans eat the salad mixing in the rice to the salad.  I tried some of the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi from my husband's plate. It came out bubbling hot on a skillet. The chicken was expertly cooked and was very tender and moist. I didn't care for the sauce because it was cloyingly sweet and not so spicy.  I feel because of the sauce on the Bulgogi I would want to give this restaurant 3.5 stars but will round it up because of Service, Atmosphere and Freshness of food.  3.5 stars",

    "text": "My wife & I came here of dinner on a Friday evening. We were greeted nicely, and was shown to our table quickly.  At first, the restaurant was somewhat empty. But shorty after we placed our order, a crowd came in and filled up all remaining tables quickly.  The Korean condiments and kimchi were fairly standard.   The pan-seared brisket salad was somewhat a disappointment. Our expectation of \"pan-sear\" is different than what this restaurant provided. Its beef was cooked in the oven, then thinly sliced. The meat was cooked through, well done. We expected the beef to be crispy on the outside and at least pink on the inside. the sesame-ginger dressing was pretty good and the greens were very fresh though.   The spicy chicken bulgogi was well seasoned but not spicy at all. The sauce was way too sweet for my taste. It was serve with one bowl of purple rice, which was regular rice steamed with cracked red (?) beans. I am not sure what to make of this purple rice.   The menu of this restaurant had no Korean dessert. I was disappointed. I was looking forward to trying out Korean desserts. Instead, there was a small board at the entrance advertising \"Tres Leches\" and 2 other cheese cakes. The \"Tres Leches\" cake was good, light and lightly sweet; it would pair well with coffee.  The service staff was friendly and polite. But the service itself was confusing. Our order was taken by one person, the appetizer was brought out by another, the main dish by yet another. We didn't know who to ask for additional plates, for example.   I am not sure this restaurant earns my recommendation, but I don't want to discourage people from trying it. I hope it will improve with time.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I'm Korean and my hubby is not. Pretty sure I know authentic korean food. Saw this as a hot new restaurant on yelp and had to try it out as my first korean food experience in Arizona. Saw a picture that a fellow yelper had posted showing they had Poke bowls as a special. Hubby loves poke bowls and not so much love for korean food. We drove over and when we walked in, we were greeted by a smiling young server named Eric. Nice guy who sat us and even apologized that they were out of diet Pepsi and offered diet coke which was fine for hubby. I ordered the kimchee stew with pork belly which is my all time favorite comfort food dish. Hubby found out that they didn't have poke bowls today so Eric and I convinced him that the spicy chirashi bowl would be a great substitution.  Found out Eric was Chinese and not korean.  When my pot came out, I realized it was soon tofu soup with kimchee instead of kimchee stew. I had ordered it by the korean name and he didn't understand it. He took it back right away and apologized. A nice lady came out and also apologized for the mix up. I felt bad but I'm not a fan of tofu soup. I was apologizing for not being clearer in my ordering. Hubby's chirashi came out and it was great with flavor and lots of fish. There were 8 banchan dishes of tempura, cucumber kimchee, kimchee, salty fish, broccoli, zucchini and a couple others. Nice variety but I love when they have egg and potatoes and dark on kimchee.  My kimchee stew came out and it was wonderful. Huge restaurant that's very clean, has tvs and a peekaboo kitchen. Huge bar offering which Koreans love. Great menu that has a bit of everything. Good pricing. Kimchee stew: $9.99 Spicy chirashi: $12.99  Thanks for great customer service and good clean food. Hoping someone ate that kimchee tofu the! I will be back!",

I've had their kimchi fried rice, Bulgogi, squid, and pork and it's all been very good!   The noise level is average. On a weekday you'll find it pretty quiet but busy on Friday and Saturday nights. I really recommend this place if you're craving Korean food in the area!",

    "text": "It was our first time here, and Korea Town was QUIET.  It was slightly after 1 pm, and for the 45 minutes that we were there, only four tables were occupied, about 12 people, or so.  (The International Market across the parking lot within the same complex was a ghost town; We later paid it our first visit, and Mom said she would not return to shop there.)  We were promptly greeted, given menus, and served ice water.  It was very chilly indoors, and after we placed our order, I returned to the car to retrieve a couple of sweaters to help keep us warm.  Mom had soup on her mind, since a coworker raved about finding \"very good pho across the street from Koreatown,\" and eventually settled on the Seafood Hot Tofu soup. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/koreatown-mesa?select=cvxFOkXGbXl7PzLhxPoc3A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kore...</a>  While finding it very tasty, with a couple of shrimp, a raw egg, and tiny chunks of chopped up scallops, she commented that it had too much tofu in it.  If we return, she'll try a bowl from the regular soup menu.  I decided to try the bulgogi rice bowl off of the lunch menui, which was described as just bulgogi on top of rice with some spring onions. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/koreatown-mesa?select=LDIhxE2I-TndVGy1IsnmAg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kore...</a>  It arrived with a fried vegetable roll and a mini gyoza.  I gave the egg roll to Mom, since it contained carrots (she said it was OK, but she wouldn't order it again as an appetizer), while I ate the gyoza.  Its pan-fried texture had a nice crisp to it.  Wish it was a bit bigger... TWSS.  As per tradition, banchan- a set of side dishes- accompanied our order. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/koreatown-mesa?select=suhFYiN6LTAQrU-ZWUETmg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kore...</a>  These small saucers contained beansprouts (good; a little bland, could've used some spice!), cubed potatoes (passable; Mom thought it had a gelatinous texture!; I didn't like its tepid temperature, nor its texture), pickled radishes (OK, nice crunch), seaweed salad (good, not too salty), fishcake (Mom said was good), kimchi (good, could've been a little fresher), spicy cucumber (beware- I thought it was zucchini, which I'm NOT allergic to, but it turned out to be cucumber, which I AM allergic to!  Too bad, because the slices had a nice spicy kick to them...), and pickled cucumber (Mom reached out for it once and didn't go back for a second taste).  Our server Sal was friendly, and later apologetic.  After I'd finished asking about the possibility of getting egg noodles on the side (no, but flour noodles are available, and did I want them in a broth?  So I asked \"What kind of broth do you have, because I'm allergic to seafood,\" and of course, it's the only kind of broth they serve here); whether I can get the bulgogi served on the side, and not on top of the rice- \"yes,\" and it arrived served on top of the rice; and what were the veggies that made up their banchan set (\"are these zucchini?\"), he apologized for not telling us what they were.  Oh, well.  I'm still alive, albeit wearing a long-sleeved thermal while sneezing and coughing in between sentences composing this review.  We may return, but not anytime soon.",

    "text": "We took great interest in this Korean restaurant due to a long list of positive reviews on Yelp. We wanted to learn if the food would live up to its name, especially given how it had been compared to those in LA Koreatown. During our visits, the interior was spacious with a red and orange colored setting. There were several TVs available to accompany the wall-to-wall images of Korean home-style dishes. With plenty of long tables neatly arranged across the open floor, the restaurant encompassed all the appropriate characteristics for groups, families, and casual gatherings.   The Mandu ($6.99) came with a number of dumplings served on a bed of vegetables. The appearance of the veggies was odd. The fillings were also too skimpy, and not as plump as I expected them to be. Not recommended.  The Dolsot Spicy Chicken Bibimbap ($12.99) came with a sunny side egg, spicy chicken, namul, and purple rice served in a hot stone bowl. The spicy chicken was tender and delicious, and the charred purple rice came out with a decent amount of crispiness and texture. The overall composition was then underscored by the spicy gochujang sauce with a taste of nutty sesame oil that lingered in the background. We both thought the serving size was noticeably smaller when compared to restaurants like GOGI. The wow factor also did not measure up to the one at Seongbukdong.  The Grilled Mackerel ($11.99) was nicely executed and served with purple rice. The Mackerel was buttery, flaky, and flavorful. The serving size was again smaller than other restaurants, but I did like the fact that it was less salty than the ones I had before.  I was really looking forward to the Galbi Tang ($11.99), but it turned out to be a disappointment. The bulky piece of rib was not fresh at all, and the meat only came off the bone after several struggles. Eggs and glass noodles were also added to the broth, but the profile was too peppery and desperately needed daikon to brighten the flavor. It was a fail.  I tried to order the Ddukbokki, but they were charging $28 for a dish that I can easily get elsewhere for less than $10.  The atmosphere was quiet and subdued on each of our visit. We find the service to be minimal and efficient, and our banchan were refilled upon request. The six to eight item banchan were on the saltier side, but still enjoyable as the flavors were mostly on point. My favorite was the kimchi due to the moist and spicy flavor without it being too sour. The fish cake was also addictive and deserved several refills. Overall, I didn't think this place measured up to the restaurants in Koreatown, or even GOGI in Chandler, which is not saying much given the limited options available in Arizona. I came to visit with high hopes, but I don't think I would return any time soon.",

Seated right way with super friendly staff.   We ordered a ton of food.   Army Noodle Soup, which the menu says is good for 2 but really it's good for 4. Huge and cooked/heated on the table the way it's supposed to be.   Pork belly bulgogi with squid was super delicious and generous portion.   Hot stone beef bulgogi was super piping hot with an egg on top! So yum.   Beef fried rice was huge and very yummy. Nice texture and flavor.   The banchan are good. The kimchi is homemade on site and is very good. Not too sour but fresh tasting     The atmosphere is nice. The place is clean. Food tastes clean and homemade.   I did not get a chance to sample soju but I will I. The future. Good soju goes so well with Korean food   Really the only complaint is soft drinks are not unlimited. Or are they? I was given a super ambiguous response. So I don't know.   Now, they don't serve jjajamyeon or jampyong. But that's ok.   It's a fairly diverse menu with some nice soups and noodle soups.   I will be back. I like good Korean food.    It is more expensive than cheap fast food. But it is a nice sit down and eat lots of Korean food restaurant.",

    "text": "With a name like 'Koreatown' you are sending a message that you are the creme de la creme.  It means you are the total package of Korean cuisine.  From our first experience here, I'm not quite sure if that is True.  The menu was quite extensive from my last recollection.  Not everything I've tried at other Korean joints were on here.  With that said, we opted based on our guts and feeling.  The item I personally enjoyed was their exceptionally good Beef Short Rib soup.  There were approximately 4 pieces of chunky Beef Short Ribs.  It was cooked perfectly tender.  When you can sink your teeth into the meat without fuss, you are on your way to meat heaven.  The broth had a nice balance of sweet and savory.  The glass noodles were cooked perfectly.  The pairing of the meat, the noodles and broth was in sync.  In conclusion, order this, I saved you from reading another review.   The other important element about eating at a Korean establishment is anticipating the petri looking dishes filled with 'banchan' or side dish.  For the most part, not much to complain about.  It was satisfying to say the least.  I love eating my main dish along with these 'banchans.'  In some ways, it helps cleanse your palate while at the same time enhance the main dish.    The interior decor is quite modern with a very spacious dining area.  Its very clean and polished.  The staff is super friendly.  They can help steer your taste buds in the right direction if necessary.  Otherwise, Have a Happy Eating!",

Their galbi bibibop was amazing!! Add the sauce!! Then had the spicy tofu kimchi soup...pretty good and then their seafood pancake was crunchy and salty...very food!!

We had the spicy pork belly, a chicken soup, and the soft shell crab appetizer. The pork came with all of the fun Korean side dishes! They add a lot to your meal as you eat them with your meat and rice they can subtly change the tastes and make each bite a new and refreshing adventure. They are also unlimited refills so careful not to eat so many you can't finish your meal! (Or do if you're looking for leftovers.) the chicken soup was a bit underwhelming compared to the main dish we had, but it was still good. And the soft shell crab appetizer was perfectly done and crisp.  Next time I'll have to try the hot pot!",

    "text": "Do you cringe at nature shows where you spend 25 minutes watching the travails of some baby wildebeast, who towards the end of the show, while pausing for a river drink, is suddenly ripped to pieces by a lurking crocodile?  Do you feel any better when the narrator closes the show with some pithy, wisened words about nature, the life cycle, and evolution?  Well - Koreatown is basically a baby wildebeast.  After spending time there you will become emotionally involved.  The folks that run the place are super nice.  They are doing everything right.  Good service.  Clean.  Friendly.  Good food.  But I think this place is at risk of  a cringe-worthy ending.  The problem is the location - a depressed, half-empty shopping center (very quiet anchor supermarket has huge banner across it advertising they accept food stamps/EBT).   The restaurant is adjacent to 'Superlaundry'.  So despite deserving to survive (kind of like nearby Oma's Place which closed last year) - I fear there is a giant croc in the waters.  The place is huge and surprisingly pleasant inside.  Why these folks opted for such a large space I do not understand.  You could set up a dance floor and pool tables and still have plenty of room for lots of tables.  Why rent such a large space?  And the operators keep everything immaculate - even the bathrooms are huge and super clean.  Foodwise I had a 3.5 star dish of seafood udon ($12), which contained lots of minaturized shellfish like tiny clams, scallops, mini bits of squid, small shrimps, and mussels.  My only complaint was the udon was a bit gritty - too many broken shells created during the stir frying process.  Served alongside were 5 pretty solid vegan banchan items.    Service was attentive.  Everyone really friendly.  This is the type of place and the type of family you want to root for.  They are working really hard to please.  But I think this baby wildebeast is at risk.  A nice interior, great service, and $12 for seafood udon would  work in Scottsdale or some other wealthier locale - but being sited where it is I think the economic crocodile is looming nearby...  I can't watch.",

    "text": "So moving from SoCal, I missed my AYCE Korean BBQ places, or even just the tofu houses that were in abundance over there, to my pleasant surprise, Koreatown just opened by the International Market by my house- and boy am I happy about it!  The food here is delicious. The hot stone pots with bulgogi, seafood ( or your choice of meat) is a safe and delicious bet for anyone. I also got the tofu soup with maximum spiciness and it was AMAZING. The flavor of the broth is on-freaking-point here. All the Korean bbq plates are great too. You'll get it on a sizzling cast iron plate whether it is galbi, bulgogi, chicken bulgogi ( they cost about $14-$20)  They also have daily specials, like cheese kimchi pancakes, or combo meat yakisoba and they are always good price ( $8.99-$15.99) and although some might say that's pricey- it's not when you consider it can often serve two and you get all the traditional Korean sides like kimchi, seaweed salad, potato salad etc).   I also recommend that you do not pass up on the pork belly lettuce wraps. It's about $16 and is not only perfect if you are trying to keep it low-carb, but is a great filling appetizer, or meal for 2-3 people. It comes with 2 types of kimchi ( one is sweeter, and the other more of a pickled vinegary style)  Also, you can get $5 sake bombs with your choice of bomber at this place- that's a steal too! And perfect to go with your spicy tofu soup, galbi plate, or pretty much anything!",

The wait for me to be seated too a while even though it wasn't that busy inside (the crowded parking must have been for somewhere else.). The waitress was very nice. I ordered the spicy stir fry squid, pomegranate soju, and water. The decor and waitresses are beautiful. The soju is pretty good. I liked the metal chopsticks and the side dishes of vegetables. The squid came out steaming hot with rice. The k-pop music in the atmosphere was satisfying. The squid was good and spicy, but not too spicy. Overall it was a very pleasant experience.",

I was surprised by the variety of the menu and 8 of us ordered different menu items and they were all excellent.  I had Cod Roe Soup and Caviar Hot Stone.  Freshness of the ingredients was very evident. I have been going to Hodori for my craving for Korean food past 14 years but this is the place I will be going from now on.",

    "text": "Another one of our go to restaurants, this place has been pretty consistent with their food. We have tried many kbbq in the area and we have noticed that the quality in food goes down after awhile.  So we are hoping the same doesn't happen here. It isn't like other kbbq in the sense of they do not have any cooktops inside the tables.  Instead they do all their cooking in the kitchen.  Unfortunately if they placed this is Korea Town this would probably be a 2 maybe 3 but Arizona kbbq is hard to come by and so far this is one of the better ones so I would give it 3.5 if they had decimal ratings.",

The Galbi was very tasty and flavorful.  My husband had the bulgogi, that was very tasty too.  My son had the Army hotpot for 2.  We had never had that before.  It was spicy, just the way my son likes it.",
