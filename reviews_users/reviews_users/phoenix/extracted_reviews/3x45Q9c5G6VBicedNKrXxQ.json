This is a great place for groups, as the menu caters to Vegans, Vegetarians, Carnivores, those that are health conscious, and others who don't count the calories. Although they do not take reservations for large parties, there is plenty of space to easily accommodate everyone. Meals are priced within reason, service is great, and the food is appetizing. Hipster/ eclectic decor with bohemian looking staff that are welcoming.",

I thought I learned my mistake and ordered it again but for pick up; so I don't have to wait that long. Now I have the wrong order, a cold salad, with meat.. Probably won't go again. Too many inconveniences for something seeming simple. Not to mention I've only been twice. Not a great expectation to start off with. Slow service and wrong orders.",

    "text": "Normally I love Pita Jungle. Still mostly do. The food is always great. But today, with a group of people, we had, by far, the worst service I have ever gotten. And one of the people at our table was friendly with our server. Well, she was served just fine. The rest of us? HORRIBLE!.  It started promising with immediate drink orders and deliveries. And then it spiraled down real fast. It was 30 minutes (maybe more) before she came by to take orders. And if you are wondering why we didn't waive her down, she wasn't anywhere to be seen.   Orders taken and 25 - 30 minutes later we are wondering where our appetizer was. She asked if we wanted it first, we said yes. I am certain if I didn't call her over and ask, we would have gotten it with our main course - something I despise. (It is called an appetizer for a reason!)  5 minutes later, appetizer. 10 minutes after that the very slow bringing of the food and the \"Auction.\" After we all had our food...oh wait, we had that lone person that had to wait a while longer. No, she didn't have a special order. Finally, we have food and drinks. Oh wait a minute - some of the table got refills.  Here is the worst part - I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food at Pita Jungle. but today, my stomach was in such knots and frustration, I really didn't enjoy the food. It was delicious, I just didn't get a chance to enjoy it.  A FEW HOURS LATER - I am very impressed by how fast Pita Jungle got in touch with me to find out more about the issue. I will go back because the food is great and because of the way management is handling this.",

    "text": "Pretty much our go to place in the area if we have 2 hours to kill, are relatively hungry for something that won't clog our arteries, and need to get our toddler out of the house.   Biggest complement I can give: Out-of-town in-laws here months ago, with a few of them pickier than your average bear (for glutein free, organic, etc). We met them here when they first arrived thinking this was the best bet for finding a good match for them, and they kept coming back for nearly every meal. Seems to be a little something for everyone, and we bring a lot of others here for a nice casual meal.  First off the service has always been outstanding. It's obvious they make a real effort to give a good experience, and bringing our little boy here isn't as much a chore as some other places. Very kiddo friendly, always lots of high chairs, by default they give crayons to the kiddies, and the kids menu doubles as an activity page (connect the dots, coloring, etc). Kids menu is also great, you get to choose one thing from each of 4 food groups-think we got mac&cheese, tofu, broccoli, and corn this last time.   Restaurant is bright and relatively clean, and when it's not scorching hot, the outdoor patio is a nice setting. Portions are Mucho large, we're usually taking something home for each of us for dinner. Food is above average, but some aspects are hit or miss (Lavosh bread wraps are too starchy for my taste). I'm a big fan of their flatbreads (especially Chicken Fetoosh) and some salads (Lentil Fetoosh, Falafel, not chicken pasta). Jalapeno Cilantro hummus and most other hummus is a good bet, but the Ahi hummus misses the mark in my opinion. Pretty good handful of local beer options for a healthy place. Overall usually a positive experience, and we'll keep going back as the ol' local standard.",

    "text": "Pita Jungle. I am a pita junkie for Pita Jungle. Let me count the ways I love this place:  1. It's healthy. There is nothing better than giving your body a shot in the arm of nutrition like you do when you go to Pita Jungle. I love feeling good about eating out.  2. It's fun. The decor in every Pita Jungle I've been to (and I've been to a few) is awesome. Bikes for light fixtures? Why not? Rotating chalk art on a giant chalk board? Sure!   3. The employees. Cheerful and helpful employees who are also just cool. So cool I get somewhat embarrassed when I show up in corduroy shorts and a  simple t-shirt.   4. It's delicious. Holy crap is this food good. I dream about their hummus, their lemony vinaigrette, and their lavosh  schwarma wrap.  Which brings me to my one criticism: they screw up my order five times out of ten. Whenever I order a lavish schwarma wrap it seems they inevitably confuse it with their chicken schwarma wrap.  PLEASE, if the Pita Jungle powers that be are listening, change the name of either your lavosh schawrma wrap or your chicken schwarma wrap so that poor Pita Jungle lovers like me don't get disappointed when we get our order! If they did that (or just stopped messing it up all the time), this review will be updated to a glowing five stars!",

I went with the spicy chicken wrap, and was not disappointed.  The portion was HUGE, which was great because I had a flight that evening and figured I wouldn't be eating for the next 6 hours or so.  The wrap itself was so fresh and flavorful.  I also loved the fact that I could eat lunch outside in 68 degree weather, which most of my Phoenix co-workers thought was \"too cold\".  Of course, I had just left 20 degrees, so 68 is pretty awesome, and worthy of eating outside.   Service was top-notch, and they had us in and out quickly.  When I come back to the Phoenix office for work, I'm definitely coming back to Pita Jungle.",

I used to dine at the location on Ray and Dobson, and the only reason I did was because of the view on the patio, and the food! The service was never horrible, I was just rarely impressed. Thought I would try out this location with my boyfriend this morning,(Friday) and I was greeted by a young lady that had the biggest smile on her face actually acting like she loved her job. She introduced herself as Jen. She then asked, \"can I make that smile bigger and start you off with a nice pineapple margarita?\" That made my boyfriend and I laugh, and if his mind wasn't set on beer, and mine wasn't set on a Cosmo, we would have gotten one. We didn't order much, but Jen still had that smile, making sure we were happy and everything was alright. She brought our drinks with waters, which I really appreciated as well. Made sure she took the plates when we were done, and was great on time. She kept small talk, but didn't bombard us, nor neglect us. We will definitely be back there very soon. And probably won't ask for anyone but Jen. I was overly impressed by her service.",

The inside of Pita Jungle is very unique...very hip and very un-Greek.  Most everyone working was white including the amazingly cute blonde hostess at the front.  Wow.

Some things are no longer on the menu, but I've asked for them anyway and they have always been accommodating. I kinda love that in a restaurant.  Our server today was great. Ask for Mariah. She'll hook you up with beverages to go and is fast and sweet.  :)    Take all your out of town guests here. Each location has different decor but the food remains consistently good at each and every one.  Love me some Pita Jungle!",

I tried it with a bit of skepticism because of the explanation that it was mashed potatoes.  In fact, I am one that usually reads every word on the menu description but in this case I just took her word for it because I wanted to try it with an open mind. Anyway, skepticism and hesitancy, be gone! I have never really been that partial to PJ but I will be returning over and over again just for the dip. In fact I'm working really hard at home today and if I complete my projects, guess where I am headed...you got it! As far as PJ itself, I can't really give a fair review because I was so enamored with the dip!  I vaguely recall average service. I had the large greek salad with gyro meat and a pita which brought that to well over 10 bucks....will have to ponder that next time however I did get two meals out of that serving.   Again, two words: garlic dip.",

I almost always order hummus, whether it's regular, bell pepper, or cilantro. So good!   My favorite salad is the tuna honey sesame salad. It has seared yellowfin tuna, leafy greens, fresh strawberries and mangos, topped with a honey sesame dressing. Awesome!  For entrees, I have tried the mahi mahi with pita chips, the chicken del sol, chicken tikka masala, chicken and onion lavosh pizza, and pesto turkey lavosh wrap.   Pita Jungle is a good choice for a fresh, healthy meal. They update their menu with different specials so you can always find something new to try.",

    "text": "Firstly, I was so excited that a Pita Jungle opened in Ahwatukee. I have been going to the Chandler and Tempe locations for many, many years and was always more than willing to make the drive because I love it there. Until recently, I was frequenting the Ahwatukee location on average of 1 - 2 times a week to meet friends for lunch. However, the last four times (in a row!) that I have been there, the service was abhorrent, and the food sub-par.   Here are some basic, common sense rules of thumb that the Ahwatukee Pita Jungle wait staff should learn to adhere to:  1) When customers order appetizers, soup and an entree, a waiter/waitress is supposed bring the appetizer out first, then the soup, then the entree. They aren't supposed to bring it out all at once and crowd it onto the table allowing most of what you ordered to get cold. This happened the last three times I was there.   2) It is absolutely disgusting when you see a waitress wiping down tables then, without washing their hands, turn around and pick your glass up by the freaking brim and refill your drink. NASTY!   3) It really shouldn't take 3 people to wait on a table of two. Especially when wait staff cannot effectively communicate with one another. Things inevitably get screwed up. It isn't a confusing job - I waited and bartended for years and have infinite patience and respect for those in the service industry, but Jesus H Christ, where do they find the staff here? The other locations aren't like this!  Anyways, I could keep going, but why bother? Don't waste your time at this location. the Chandler location on Ray and Dobson is only 10 minutes away and it is soooo much better!",

Fantastic service, some great vegetarian food in Ahwatukee (finally!!!!) and there is absolutely  nothing for me to give it anything other than 5 stars.  The waiter was very fast and friendly, the atmosphere was pleasant, and overall the food was excellent.  I lived in the Mideast years ago and I love falafel...you can't find good middle east food in my neck of the woods...at least not until now. I'm sooo happy they're here; it beats Chinese by a long shot!!!",

You always get a warm welcome when you come here. They have a lot of art on their walls that's for sale supporting local artists. This place has a great bar with some great beers on draft.

Not once have we had a bad experience.  Love, love LOVE that Ahwatukee now has their own PJ with AMPLE OUTDOOR SEATING. Best place for fresh, crisp iced tropical tea or a glass of wine. Great art (often for sale) on the walls and delicious pitas... My fav's for lunch are the Chicken Philly Pita (ask them to add mushrooms if you like), the red pepper hummus plate, and the Lavosh Schawarma Wrap. For dinner, their fresh fish dishes are always prepared in some tasty, unique way...love the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips and the Broiled Chicken Salad is huge and satisfying...yum! Desserts are very tasty too, if you have room for some Baklawa or Carrot Cake.",

Even if the Indian cuisine scares you off, there is something you must realize: by its very nature, Pita Jungle excels at that area of cuisine. The two other people in my party (especially the one who ordered the wood-fired salmon) could not get over how fresh the food was. My dish had flavors that wanted to jump off the plate and right into my mouth.  The mountain of positive Yelp reviews for the Pita Jungle locations in the Valley is a testimonial. It might just be the best fast casual restaurant in Ahwatukee and west Chandler.",

For a party of five (three adults and two children) we had plenty of room on the patio.  Our server was nice and made a suggestion or two.  We opted for drinks and appetizers, we wanted to catch RA for sushi.  Our choice of appetizers were delicious, the tri-flavor hummus plate, falafel platter and mozzarella tomato and basil plate.    We had an odd feeling throughout our meal and couldn't place what it was.  Then right before we left we realized there wasn't any music outside!?!

I ordered the Chicken Lavash flat bread and was really not impressed. My chicken was over cooked and dry and the flatbread was super crunchy (almost like a tortilla chip). There was zero flavor/sauce which made it taste even worse. In the end, I only had about half (since I was hungry) and did not ask for a box.

When we first walked in, we weren't really greeted and had to walk around before people noticed us. After we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food and began eating as it was our first meal after a long drive from Los Angeles, CA. After eating a bit, we noticed a long hair underneath our pita bread which wasn't too much of a problem as had it returned to the kitchen. The server brought out new pita bread which was hot, I guess it was fresh? Fresher than the cold pita bread we received before.   Service isn't very attentive but the food is good, so I can't complain too much. At least they're friendly. Overall, food quality is consistent to the Pasadena location which I have frequented many times. Good healthy lunch to start off our vacation. Location is pretty big, so maybe just have servers keep an eye out for guests walking in so they don't pile up at the door waiting.",

I will not talk about every single stupid little detail.  Plus I will not cry because the hostess did not smile at me when I first walked in.  I only care about how the chefs feel anyways.  If you want long reading.  I suggest you read about how to assemble a Haiku poem.    We stopped by here on Saturday at lunch time.  I ordered the Turkey Lavosh Wrap and it was really good.  The salad was really good too that came with it.  We ordered some fried pastries stuffed with feta and spinach.  It was really good.  I did not notice the green pesto on the plate.  That took it up a notch to awesome.  This place is good and I recommend it.",

The food is good and price is reasonable.    Love the cilantro jalepano hummus! I generally get the chicken pasta salad. The dressing for the salad is zesty and yummy! I also really like the chiptole chicken wood fired pizza. The nachos are yummy as well. I recently was able to go for their Happy Hour and was pretty happy with rhe outcome. The portions were small but for $1-$3 a plate  ...I won't complain! (See pictures).",

Brunch has some really wonderful options, and who am I kidding - the $2 mimosas that's what I really love!! Also, my Mom brings her dog and we sit outside, so overall it is a really nice weekend spot. For lunch have been enjoying some of the incredible salads, and happened to stop in on half price Wine Wednesdays, got a lovely bottle of Estancia Chardonnay for only 13 bucks. TIA and JOE have been our servers lately, and they are both incredible. The host is also extremely welcoming. Looking forward to our next visit!!!",

If we have ever had an order come out wrong (which is VERY rare), the manager RC and GM Christine have been awesome in making sure we are taken care of and our experience is positive. We actually went yesterday with the kids and had Devon as a server...she did an excellent job! No matter what we order on the menu, it's always delicious. Some of our all time favorites are: baba ganoosh, hummus, mediterranean chicken salad, veggie & portobello mushroom burgers and the pesto lavosh turkey wrap!

Some of the food is consistently good, but other items are disappointing. The many, many bussers didn't think to clear our empty plates.

    "text": "I have been eating at Pita Jungle since the original location opened and have never had such a horrendous experience.  I recently met a group of friends at the Ray Rd location. When we arrived it wasn't that busy, but we still waited quite a few minutes for anyone to greet us. Most of the young servers seemed busy hanging out in the kitchen and the drink station areas. This doesn't set a professional atmosphere. Customers are waiting, so the employees can \"hang out\" at work? After waiting around ten minutes our server came to the table, no introduction, and said, \"Drinks?\" We decided to go ahead and order the Hummus with chicken, Spanakopita, and a Greek Salad to start with. The chicken served with the hummus was horrible. Little tiny pieces of burnt dried chicken that looked as if it had been chewed and somehow there was a puddle of grease surrounding the chicken. Pita Jungle usually has some of the moistest, flavorful chicken. The pita's served to us were hard and still seemed to be frozen in the middle. The Spanakopita was very bland at this location and almost has a sourness like it wasn't very fresh. This was also served cold in the middle. The Greek Salad was another disappointment. The spring mix was obviously bad, with a lot of rotten pieces. At this point, it should have been obvious to our server we did not enjoy our appetizers, since we barely ate them. She came to the table, asked if we were finished and took away our barely eaten appetizers. Our mistake for not walking out then. We ordered a Chicken Combo, Salmon, and a Gyro. The chicken was raw this time. I see this is a common occurrence for this location. When we brought it to our servers attention all she could say was, \"Well, what do you want me to do about it?\" We were in shock, she didn't seem to even care we were served raw chicken. We asked for her to do a re-fire, which was a mistake. Apparently the kitchen staff wants to retaliate on customers who send food back. The chicken was cooked this time, but it was as if they add a cup of salt on top on my food. The salt almost made me choke. The salmon was mediocre at best, way overcooked. The gyro meat was still frozen. The meat was not even warm, how did they send this out to be served? Seriously PJ? We finally asked to speak with the manager. I believe her name was Christine or Christina, now I can see why the staff is so unprofessional. She wasn't apologetic to any extent. She became defensive as we described the cold dishes. When we brought up the raw chicken, she exclaimed, \"We would never serve raw chicken to our customers!\" Totally blown away by the treatment of everyone, especially the general manager. She treated us as if we were just looking for something free. She finally offered to take off the chicken combo, and laughed as if it was a joke. Completely appalled at this Pita Jungle, I have even reconsidered ever stepping foot into another PJ. This has left a very very bad taste in my mouth. You should find professional management, who don't argue with customers and laugh in their faces.",

    "text": "Having been to several of the Pita Jungles around the valley (corporate and franchised locations) it looks like the owners have refined their formula for future growth.  While this location lacks some of the funkiness of other, more intimate Jungle spots, it seems this version will be the template for large-scale  Jungle world domination.  The space has ample seating, a good sized bar area and a large patio for Phoenix-style al fresco dining (which,unfortunately, typically means a lovely view of the parking lot).   What sets this location apart, however, is Sam!  If you have the chance, ask for this dude to take care of you.  Sam is perhaps the most accommodating server we've had anywhere in some time.  He even handled my mom (the prototypical high maintenance, special order customer) with aplomb and grace.  He was on the spot and his attitude and knowledge of the menu were exeptional. In all honesty, we may have enjoyed his service as much as the meal, which was the consistently fresh and tasty Jungle fare.   We have only one recommendation for improvement: please. please, please stop serving gyro meat of the stamped and pre-sliced variety.  Good gyros mean meat shaved off the spit (like those found at Haji-Baba in Tempe). Aside from this soap box admonition, score another win for PJ in Ahwatukee.",

He made some great recommendations and I loved the food. The hummus, chicken pasta salad, the salmon, chicken combo, salads and desserts were delicious and amazing. The ingredients were fresh and the portion sizes are large, which makes for some leftovers. :)  I am also a big tea drinker and was shocked to learn how many different tea combinations could be made, thanks to our wonderful server. The service was top notch and and we enjoyed the friendly atmosphere. I can not wait to go back again, and I will definitely request Kyle as my server!",

    "text": "As a Lebanese-American that moved to Phoenix 2 years ago, from Los Angeles via Chicago,  I've been very disappointed with the selection and quality of Middle Eastern.....oh .....uhum .\"Mediterranean\"\"  restaurants in the area.  I finally made it to my neighborhood Pita Jungle.  The location is excellent, right next to a movie theater and other restaurants and shopping.  The restaurant itself, is large and airy and is very hip.  The service was OK, friendly but needs some work with getting the order right.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting an authentic Middle Eastern food experience.  I ordered the Tabooli (Parsley Salad) and a side of Hummus and a side of 3 falafels.  I am pleased to say that I was surprised how good the Tabooli was. Very authentic.  I asked for a side of olive oil and lemons. I like it extra lemony.  The humus was excellent and very flavorful.  The falafels on the other hand need some work...They looked overcooked (falafels are supposed to be a medium brown, and these were almost black). The mixture needs work, maybe a hint more garlic.  The pita bread was warm and tasty.  Overall I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely try it again.",

We went for happy hour recently and ordered quite the spread...how can you not when everything is less than $3?!  The hummus trio ($1) was much less than expected but nonetheless, really good. It was basically a teaspoon of each hummus; even our server agreed it was very little and brought us a second. The jalapeno was my favorite. The baba ganoosh ($1) was soooo good- and there was plenty of that to go around- although I may have eaten most of it myself! We enjoyed the dolmades (2 for $2), and the falafel (2 for $1 were delicious). I ordered the garlic lemon chicken ($2) for myself, and had to shoo away random forks that kept landing it in- it was a very generous portion, so I was nice enough to share a few pieces. Other than the happy hour dishes we ordered, we got a cup of the cocunut curry soup (?) which did not disappoint- in fact, it was so good, we got a second cup!  The restaurant itself is quite large inside, but opted to sit outside. The patio is also a nice size and is shaded, which was perfect on this unusually hot winter day.  Happy hour is definitely worth the trip, and I can't wait to come back and try some of the amazing looking salads and pitas I saw!",

The burger was overcooked and this side of flavorless...under-seasoned. My salmon was ok but the mashed potatoes were real watery and again the whole dish needed seasoning. The salmon was cooked fine but over-all both entrees were very bland. The watery potatoes were really bad.  The service was fine at the bar, hostess and server. The place is way too bright. The patio was a nice dining option. I don't think we'll be back which is a shame because we go to that AMC theater there quite often.",

My girls arrived at 10:30 to setup since we had it starting at 11am and the staff was friendly and helpful even with helping carry things in.  Our server, Valerie, was very attentive, sweet and quick.  The place itself is very cute and since it kind of went with my theme of 'natural/wildlife', it was an ideal setting... all the decor was spot on and we had very little to decorate for the event (the back room is very well decorated in that sense).  We hosted Sangrias and Tea/Lemonade as well as Appetizers and Lavash Pizzas (basically everything) and with the 10 girls, it came out to $13 a person which was pretty perfect, especially since it included alcohol (the girls ordered whatever drinks they wanted).  The girls afterward said they had a great time, especially since the pizzas were so good (and the sangrias)... I'm happy they liked the food.  This was a great place to host a party and the price point was perfect, too... decor was in-line with our theme and the staff was 5 stars!  I recommend this place :)",

So now, instead of enjoying a quiet bite to eat, I'm forced to listen to conversations on both sides.  When I asked the host to seat me elsewhere, I was told that there's no server for that table/section.

I stumbled in because a friend referred a girlfriend and she wanted to try (thank you Janae).   This particular location isn't much on the outside but has a pretty cool environment inside and on the patio especially at night.   It's always lively and a little loud, which I love. The waiters/waitresses don't have uniforms so it's got a pretty laid back feel to it.   This place isn't just a cool nice hangout though, the food is delicious. At first I was apprehensive to try hummus but I tried both red and green with pita chips which are great themselves (I'll get to those next). My favorite is the red hummus but the green is very refreshing.   You've got to try the pita chips, I always see them in the bag at grocery stores and never tried them and still haven't till this day because I'm afraid they won't match the taste/texture of Pita Jungle's. I always get them when I go, a must. They offer them baked or fried.   The portions for each meal are pretty good size so expect to take some home. Oh and try the chicken chipotle pizza! It's to die for.    The bad:   I've gone to the Tempe location twice now and coincidentally got pretty bad stomachache and ended up hurling both times. It seemed a little dirtier than others but it didn't deter me from going to the other locations because I simply love their food.   Five stars because the environment is nice and the food is even better.",

    "text": "I just moved into the area and was excited to see a Pita Jungle so close to home. This location had great service the first 2 times I ordered here. I ordered online the first time and at the restaurant the second.. With my recent visit, the staff were so busy chatting and giggling with each other that my order was mishandled and prepared incorrectly. I would like to think that although my order was remade quickly and without further issues,  I would continue to eat here.  I'm leaning on not. I'm in the customer service field and understand the weight of making the customer feel appreciated and not like they are an afterthought. It's fine to obviously chat with your coworkers,  but don't be so outlandish that it looks like you're not working or have any ounce of professionalism. You all are handling other people's food and drink.  The customer service at this location could be alot better, in my opinion after this recent trip.  2 stars for the first visits. I'll be hard pressed to come back here any time soon.",

    "text": "I really do appreciate good food, great atmosphere and great service. Pita jungle on ray road has been a go-to for my family and I for some time. First, I love the decor and art work. However, I think the space of the tables do not accommodate a family that well. They are small and have to many things on the table to feel comfortable. The bathrooms are somewhat clean and s mirror is missing in the men's bathroom, the paper towel holder was out on one side and water all over the counter-top. My recommendation is there has to be more attention to detail.  The food, is always good, that is what keeps my family and I coming back. On occasion we get stomach aches, but all-in-all I respect the cooks and type of food that is served. I really like the ability to take the drinks home with fresh drink to go.  The service, is always great. I appreciate all the servers and hostess's. For example, the hostess Madison was such a great personality and greeted my family and I with kindness and respect. Her up-beat personality was addictive. She helped my family get to our table in a area that was not in the middle of the restaurant. I noticed How busy today was, but she still made our first 5 minutes at pita a outstanding time. I appreciate great employees.  I never give a 5 star rating. However, I give two thumbs up for great service, good food and good environment.",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW:  The same day as my visit to Pita Jungle, I received a response from Kevin. He asked that I contact him and give him more information. He did indicate to me that lunch is absolutely served at this location at LUNCH time and that he would take some time to educate his employee on how brunch works. Kevin was very kind and considerate, and also promptly sent a free entree card, which I did use, right before my cross country move. When we walked in, we asked for lunch menus and I received my broiled chicken salad. Service was great.   With my current diet, I am limited on my food options, but Pita Jungle has always been a go to for me with their broiled chicken salad. Showed up and sat down, at 12:00, mind you, and noticed that we were only given brunch menus. After waiting for our waiter for a good five minutes, he shows up and we ask for lunch menus. He proceeds to tell us that they do not serve lunch until 2:30. Well... I like to eat lunch at a normal time. Not at dinner time. We decided to leave and the guy acted as if we had offended him by doing so. Shame because their lunch was spot on. I will not be returning.",

While dining in, we used to have a to-go offered of whatever we were drinking (tea or lemonade) - no longer the case. A large order of soup to-go now gets you a large container - half full.

The staff is super friendly (which is typical of all the locations), they look hip (of course) but the best part is they are on top of it! I have not had to wait long here. There always seems to be enough employees, even when it is super busy.  The actual restaurant is artful and visually pleasing, full of fun and whimsy. The bikes on the ceiling are fun and the colorful wall above the kitchen are my favorites. There is a lot of room which is helpful since I have small children.   I enjoy the menu, which is consistent with all locations. The hummus cannot be beat anywhere. It truly is the best available I have ever had.  The kids meals are so nice. I love the options for the kiddos. It helps kids feel like they have a say in what they eat but all of the options are healthful. I don't have to lie and omit options from their choices. It's great! The most touching thing about this location is the management went above and beyond to consider the families with kids and had a small basket of toys the kids could pick from with their meal. It actually was a \"happy meal\" for all. Just such a treat.   Thank you for providing a wonderful dining experience!",

To start with we found the Spanakopita to be incredibly salty, like they used a tbsp instead of a tsp. My wife ordered the Broiled Chicken Pita which I have had before and is good, but this time it was a disaster. The chicken was cold and the pita was cold and stiff. It got sent back and we got a new one which was better but still not as good as the Chandler location that I have eaten at before. I ordered a spicy chicken lavosh wrap. Now I love spicy food, but besides being spicy, this had absolutely no flavor. It seemed as if the mix had been marinating for a few days killing off any flavors that the beautiful ingredients should have had. Again very disappointing.  Not sure if it is because this is a new location or a large location for them, but I have experienced much better, and the food quality was so far off their standard it makes me hesitant about ever going back. It is not complicated food so it shouldn't be that hard to get it right.",

    "text": "We had an incredibly disappointing experience with the bar.  It was my husband's birthday and we decided to go to Pita Jungle for a late lunch. The hostess promptly seated us at a table that wobbled so bad I thought the top may fall off and on the floor was a host of objected to help steady but without success. We asked to be moved. The next table was better but not perfect.   We ordered 2 pineapple margaritas from the drink menu. Our server took our appetizer order and brings 2 glasses of water. The water was non-filtered and had a smell I guess that why they put lemons in it. Now our appetizers arrive and our server is assuring us our drinks are coming. We see her go back to the bar and tell the manager she needs these drinks. But I don't think the manager now's how to mixed drinks because they still aren't getting made. In fact no ones are getting made. The table behind is wondering where their drinks are and the table across from us too.    Drinks finally arrived. It took at least 15 minutes maybe longer to get our drinks. Our food arrived 5-7 minutes before the drinks. Sad but True. It was at this point we decided to go elsewhere. The appetizers were good and the waitress was kind and this is only reason I am giving them 2 stars.   No excuses we watched the hostess get over whelmed, the servers get over sat, tables not getting pre-bussed or even cleaned once the customers left. Did the busser have the holiday off? Did the service bartender have the day off? A manager was present and it didn't make it any better. Is this a fluke?",

This location is missing the Pond they have at the other location past the 101 on Ray Road, but it has a much bigger patio which is always a good thing.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty big and a little more modern than the other Pita Jungles.  The staff was very nice and efficient on my visit.  Since they have only been open two weeks I think that is a very good sign.   This is a busy shopping center so the parking isn't as great as you would assume it to be. A special note to the Minivan that parked in the compact spot next to me, your car is not a compact.  Try:  - Nachos! - Ginger Stir Fry - Lavosh Pizza  - Hummus",

Last week we stopped in for a late dinner and it took any single server about 15 minutes to come greet us. Many staff members looked at us, and saw that we had not been helped (we did not even have menus) but keep walking. My family loves this location because it is very convenient and the food is always on point (my favorite dish is the macro platter). We are both shocked and upset at the lack of customer service we received during our last visit.",

    "text": "Ive been to this Pital Jungle many times. Each time, I get great GREAT service. I eat  a little fish, but mostly vegetables. I can't think of another group of restaurants that cater so greatly to that demographic.   But, if I were to be honest, EVERYthing on the menu isn't great.  My husband.. who is stricktly meat and potatoes, isn't a fan of PJ. It's like the meat options lack something for him.   For a year, I only ordered the Mahi Mahi special. I think that dish, is amazing. That Jalapeno hummus is like crack! I love every moment of eating it. Couple that with some decently cooked grilled fish.. and pita chips... and SALSA.. well I am in heaven. lol   A couple of weeks ago I decided to get the black bean burger. It's good. But, I think I ordered it twice because it really does have the potential to be outstanding!  Here's the problem: 1) It's messy .. BUT most things delicious are, so you look past that  because it's on a  fantastic bun... with hummus.. except 2) it's kind of dry. Like the hummus and the bean burger makes it dryer than it should be.. it's missing a good BBQ or some sort of sauce and 3) some grilled veggies on top like mushrooms or something would have been nice.  But the potatoes  that come on the side area also friggin amazing.. so knowing me.. I will order the burger again and doctor it up a bit.   Like I said, its a greatly made (and large) veggie burger.. it's just missing the extra to make it outstanding.  Other than that one must seriously try:   The Jalapeno Hummus The Ahi Tuna and Hummus.. lol   Oh .. and did I mention there is crack in the hummus??",

I was in there tonight. You basically have to argue with him to be able to sit where you want, even when the whole patio is empty. The funny thing is, he puts you in the absolute worse table possible. It's funny to see which customers will ask for another table and then be unfortunate enough to experience his indifferent and subtlety rude attitude. Worst host ever. He looks kinda like Ray Romano with a tan and his nose is pierced. I would think the owner of this  restaurant would be extremely disappointed to see his patrons experiencing this. Everyone else in that place is fantastic, including the food.",

It may not be fair to say that everyone was rude, but two out of three waiters, managers, have been very rude.  Surprisingly rude in suggesting that we sit outside in 103F weather with small kids, after being asked to accommodate us reasonably with better seating.  Customer service is art, it is a backbone of every service oriented business, so my suggestion is that Pita Jungle management seriously examines their expansion and what they want to become.    We left, 12 of us and took our business elsewhere, and I hope that others will not tolerate low standards at this location.",

    "text": "I find myself at Pita Jungle Ahwatukee once every week or two,  mostly due to lack of other more healthy options in the area and the fact that I can order vegan very easily.  However it is unfortunate that the food almost always far exceeds the customer service standards...  with the exception of a couple of servers, Keith being one of them. It seems like management is too lax and although I can appreciate a casual environment, it shouldn't mean service suffers. It is usually expected that our waiter/waitress will be talking to another server at a POS or by the bar when we are waiting for drinks or even after the food has been delivered, rather than asking if there is anything else we need. We have been on the patio numerous times and it has appeared the servers pick up patio tables so they have some inside then maybe a random few outside, which typically lends to patio tables getting poorer quality service and servers feeling too strained.   Pita Jungle offers great options for children, however when I asked on our most recent lunch visit, which of the food options are organic for the kids meals (i.e fresh fruit) the server said \"I don't think any\".  With the spotlight currently on non-gmo food and organic living, I am very surprised that Pita Jungle hasn't taken the organic plunge yet.  I think the business would sky rocket.  Overall it's not bad,  but it could take steps to hold servers more accountable while still maintaining the artsy edge and definitely introducing organic options.",

I had the chance to go back as the manager was nice enough to reach out and offer to give me another try.   I did go back but this time I went to the location out in Gilbert, I will say this, I got the California wrap and it was awesome it had great flow an awesome filling with the chicken olives and veggies and side salad, I was ready to jump to my pic and update my review in an instant.   The same weekend I went back to the Pita Jungle on Ray road and my opinion again Hit rock bottom.  We ordered the exact same dishes and the food was missing ingredients that were not in the wrap we had had at the Gilbert location.  Not only my food but my guests food as well was no where near what we had from the other Pita Jungle.   I don't know what it was or why but I know there are some Pita Jungles I will visit and others I will pass by.   Hence the three stars for this particular locations.",

    "text": "I ordered the spicy chicken wrap because when I saw a photo posted on this yelp page (it's been removed) it looked appetizing. It was picked up with a bunch of orders placed with coworkers in my office. What I got instead was this open-faced pita that clearly was not wrapped. There was also a swirl of sriracha sauce on top of the aluminum foil it was wrapped in which wasn't wrapped nicely either. I called and was explained that the kitchen \"makes it that way\" because it's \"big\". I get it, but they decorate aluminum foil with sriracha sauce, really? I asked for the manager but they had to call me back because they were busy. They waited so long I couldn't answer anyway since I was off of my lunch hour. Thank goodness I was starving since I had no time to return this ugly mess they call a \"wrap\". Here are a few photos from what they advertise on their menu online vs. What I was given. This was a disservice to pita jungle and I wasn't happy at all with either my food or the person who answered the phone that tried explaining that slop.",

Have eaten here a couple of times before, it was good but nothing great, this time it was definitely above average!  Would recommend for those who have family in town or want to sit out on a patio while our weather is fantastic",

    "text": "I waited at the bar patiently to put in a to go order. The bartender was busy on the phone taking a to-go order which took ages and def not her fault. One guy was at the bar and pulled at his credit card, so I assumed he was ready for something as well...when she got done with her to-go order she then took a couple's order who were sitting at the bar. However, not once during this time did she acknowledge me standing there with a To go menu in my hands...not even a quick, hello! or even a, I'll be right with you, nothing. After serving and bartending for a majority of my life, that is just what you do. Once she took the couples order and entered it in, she walked passed me to the guy with the credit card since he was there before me and took care of him. Again, no acknowledgment. At that point a new guy walks up right between the guy with the credit card and myself. After she finished cashing out credit card guy, she goes right to the new guy who just walked up and starts taking his order. I immediately walked off. After waiting so patiently, I was shocked she'd skip right over me and go to the guy who just walked up. Unbelievable. It's called customer service. If you didn't know who was next, just ask!! Everyone waiting will know. I decided to leave and not give this place my business. As I waited by the hostess stand, a man came by to ask if I was helped. I said, no, that's why I'm leaving. He then said he's the manager and would like to take care of me so I'll return. I told him what happened, he said the bartender is really good and must have not seen me or something.  Either way, at the end of the day, the manager spoke to the bartender, took care of my salad and took the initiative to make things right. That and the fact their food is delicious is why I have this location 5 stars.",

We were surprised the food was pretty good.   The waiter was great he brought us an array of appetizers hummus, pest hummus, falafel and cucumbers with Pita bread. The chicken tikka masala was actual decent and so was the shawarma wraps. It was perfect after a long day.   The waiter was great friendly and great at suggesting what we should have when we had questions. The menu was a blend of different cultures which was great cuz if you can't decide what to eat there are enough choices on the menu.",

The large patio is very nice as well and offer great heaters to stay warm in Arizona's cooler months.    Today I enjoyed the caramelized cauliflower appetizer which was very good.  Definitely going to get that again.  It was light and crunchy, almost like a popcorn consistency in a nice sauce.  I also had the Kafta pizza.  Even though I enjoyed it, next time I will add some jalapenos to the mix and make it a tad more flavorful.  For gluten free seekers, at an up charge you can get gluten free on any pizza.",

The place was packed, a single person walked in front of us, the hostess sat him in the last 4 top. Then she told us we had to wait, we sat for a few minutes, then a couple came in and she sat them imI was irritated as I looked through the place to see many singles in tables with 4 chairs. I think she needs a few \"hostess placement lessons\". We walked out right over to Savor Flavor, and had a delicious fast meal. I will go back to Pita Jungle, but I hope this review makes someone teach their hostesses how to properly seat people when the place is busy.   Update: Kevin mailed me two free entrees for his establishment, I am more than pleased and can not wait to return to the Pita Jungle with my family. Thank you Kevin!",

She reordered after shrimp info. The tapas pizza shouldn't take too long.   I poured refills on teas and waters as servers did not.

There were many empty tables Monday 4:30.   I did speak to manager on our way out, he had reasons for poor service  and offered a comp appetizer next visit. How will that be documented? Most managers give you a business card with item written. I will not ask for free app.  Food was fine.  Lots of dining choices in the area.  Won't rush back.

I always feel when you sit outside, the waiters forget about you or something. It was so lovely out we didn't want to be cooped up inside though. The timeline went as follows:  -Drinks were ordered, took at least 10-15 minutes to get our basic order. Longer for the booze, it came a little before the meal and the waiter had to be reminded. -We ordered several tapas since the waiter pointed out that they were having happy hour specials. They never arrived. -They were busy but the wait was so long for food we eventually ended up trying to find our waiter to see if they had forgotten about our order.  -At long last the food came and we had to remind her we had ordered tapas and we had wanted them before the meal. So we ended up with tapas with our meal which was ideally ordered to go with the drinks.  The falafel platter was a little disappointing as is the case whenever I order it from here. For some reason they always over-fry the balls leaving them too hard. Nothing really beats Haji Baba's or Elie's Deli.",

She constantly had her cell phone in hand at all times and even delayed service to her customers while she took and made  personal calls. Very unprofessional and found it unbelieveable that the management allowed it. I and my wife were there on a Thursday for an early dinner between 4:30-5:30pm. The dining area did not protect you from the blinding Sun since there were no shades. We had to move to another table in the corner of restaurant.",

The best part about it was the grilled red pepper on the side. Some bland potatoes didn't help.   My partner had a trout salad. The fish was kind of smelly which indicates it was too old.   I have eaten here several times and have never been impressed. There are many Mediterranean places in the valley that have far better food and they are way cheaper.  The building has no sound dampening so the eating area is extremely loud. People start yelling at each other in order to be heard so the din was annoying and uncomfortable. I had a tough time hearing my partner or the waiter. There was so much noise I was afraid I was going to get a headache.   As for atmosphere -- it was industrial and not pleasing. They should call it a Concrete Pita Jungle.",

We did call in advance to make sure they could. When we got there our table was ready and we were seated right away. I was very excited to see a glass of water already at each seat. Being over 100 outside, cold water was a pleasant sight.  I ordered the Wood-Fire Chicken. The quantity of the plate was great. More food then I could eat and believe me it was sooooo good, I tried to eat it all. The chicken had so much flavor and was very tender. The garlic tomato sauce was a perfect topper and the potatoes was a good bottom.   The only reason why I'm not giving this review a 5 star is because we ordered a round of alcoholic drinks and it took 15 mins for us to get them. I understand that it was 12 drinks but you could tell they were sitting for awhile cause mine was watered down by the time I got it. This was disappointing.   Check out the pictures.

I've tried to be patient as I know every restaurant can have a bad day. Yet, once again my Togo order was incorrect. We ordered a kids meal and they failed to give us the chocolate milk I specially asked for. In addition, the bun to the salmon burger was burnt. Like on the top fully burnt (photo below), and staff thought it was still acceptable to bag and serve. On the phone, when ordering the person could barely understand which is ok I get it places have background noise, but then set up staff for success. The girls at the door barely greeted me and once they knew I was there for pick up it was like oh go over there. The poor girl running pick ups was by herself and clearly overwhelmed. She made me wait while she put a phone order in. Last I checked it the customer present in front of you goes first. Just common hospitality etiquette, but again she was running phones and orders and pick up orders solo, while there was two hostesses chatting at the front. So I guess this boils down to management. Please just be aware of which pita jungle you go to. I love pita jungle, but this one barley gets two stars. The food is decent and it's closer to my house, but I shouldn't have to drive out of my to get a better experience from the same restaurant company. Pick your battles folks.",

We came yesterday and my sister and I ordered the usual our California beach lavash. It was missing the avocado and was dry. My sister also got an upset stomach we don't know why... we eat here often.  Long story short the waitress gave us vouchers to come back, so we did today.  Today my mom and I ordered the same lavash and this time it was dry (missing the mayo mix) again, missing avocados again, and was cold. The staff is super nice and offer to bring the ingredients but since it was already cold by the time they brought the mayo and avocado my lavash was super cold. Also it falls apart when you open it to place the items inside of it. The staff is always friendly but the kitchen staff is messing up! 2019 has not been off to a great start for them. I hope they fix this because we love coming here! Please see picture the lavash wraps usually have color and mine looks uncooked.  Please please please fix this pita jungle!!",

Thinking it'd be fresh because they just opened.  Got my order, I'm starved, started to eat the gyro, hard pieces of burnt dried up meat crunching in my teeth. I spit them out. Open the gyro to find cold, very very dry meat. Looked days old.  Non satisfactory! The lettuce was wilted and old.  Will not be wasting my money here anymore!  Gross!!  Previous review of 5 stars is a thing of the past.  So disappointed!   Great food! Love that they do door dash. I'm Never disappointed in what I order. The fire grilled salmon is amazing. I love their roasted pepper hummus and grilled chicken. The chicken shawarma is tasty, I add taziki to",

She said \"um, you can try going to the bar and they can help you.\" It was funny how little she or the other host understood or cared about my situation.

I hope it's just a training issue, and can be fixed.",

    "text": "I love Pita Jungle.  There's no denying that. If you read nothing else in this review, read this: Do NOT go to PJ on a Saturday for another couple months.  It is CHAOS.  Now that is out of the way, on with the review.  SERVICE: My server, Ahkil (pronounced like Shaquille, as he pointed out), was friendly, on top of things and as patient with the kitchen as humanly possible.  KITCHEN: The kitchen was so far behind that our order of two Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pitas, which take no more than 10 minutes at every other PJ, took more than 50 minutes to get to us.  FIFTY.  That is FIVE TIMES the normal amount of time (for you math-challenged Yelpers).  BACK TO SERVICE: When we were seated, Ahkil stopped by immediately and said \"I will be right back.  I have to check on some food for the starving kids at the table behind you.\"  A-OK in my book.  Hungry kids = cranky kids.  I know this for a fact.    Later, when DH and I were starting to become the cranky kids, Ahkil asked the kitchen to make us ANYTHING (we found this out later).  I saw that the table next to us got a free order of hummus for waiting so long.  When one of the servers stopped by our table and asked if we wanted complimentary hummus and chicken while we waited for our food (at about 35 minutes in), I practically KISSED her.   DESIGN: I love the new dining room.  Above the kitchen there is an art piece that is reminiscent of the rolled magazine vase on the host stand.  Very cool.  The bar has what appears to be a \"color me in\" wall.  There are a lot of different lampshades hanging from the ceiling in the dining room.  The ducts are exposed and painted white.    FOOD: Typical PJ food, which is to say... AWESOME.  Of course, for some reason the chicken in my pita was cold.  I can't figure that out since it took so long to make it that I thought someone was actually PLUCKING the chicken.  Still, it was yummy and I ate everything except for the appetizer (which was redundant since we got the free \"please don't walk out\" app from the kitchen.  Let me reiterate: Let this place have a few months to slow down so they can figure out how to accommodate all those orders.  In the meantime, I will get my PJ fix at the Tempe location.  The first is really always the best anyway.  ;)",

I asked for a manger and was told the adjustment could be made. 2) Another time I was told they were out of house wine. 3)  Two weeks later I was told they do not have reverse happy hour on wine any longer and was given a wine list.  Watch out for upsales and check your bill as the errors I found were in their favor.  Review your bill before you pay and don't feel pressured ordering something you don't want.

    "text": "So happy to have a Pita Jungle in Ahwatukee.  Went yesterday (Tuesday) and it was very busy for a late lunch crowd. Great view of South Mountain from the patio.  We went during happy hour they have tapas for 1, 2 and 3 dollars speaking my frugal language..... the tomato mozzarella.... FRESH and tasty.  Small but perfect for starters. I normally order the fruit and cheese plate served as a meal but we order as an appetizer then I get the pita pizza perfect for kids or for someone that has devoured half a cheese and fruit platter on her own.    For my husbands birthday they let us bring in a cake ( most restaurants will not allow at all or will charge a plate  / serving fee) no singing...... they are not that kind of restaurant....  my husband would have divorced me if people came out singing and clapping happy happy birthday to our guest.    Great experience LOVE the eclectic decor.",

Whenever I have out of state friends come in, we always go to Pita Jungle and no one leaves disappointed. I normally always get the grilled chicken with hummus as my entree (it's on the appetizer menu) and I substitute the white hummus for their garlic dip. Their lemonade is also amazing. I have been to many locations all across the Valley (Ahwatukee, original Tempe, Ray & Dobson, downtown, Fashion Square, MCC, Dana Park, Williams Field) and they are all consistent in my opinion. Overall the menu at Pita Jungle is on the healthy side, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. I would definitely recommend giving Pita Jungle a shot if you've never been here.",

    "text": "We love the Pita Jungle on Ray & Dobson in Mesa, so when were in the neighbor we stopped at the E Ray Rd Pita Jungle.   The site needs some very serious management attention.  We arrived for a very late lunch and while they were not busy, they had a long wait list.  There were several tables for two available and I asked if we could be seated at one of them and the young man seating people said I would need to wait until he seated some of the larger groups.  We waited about 15 minutes (Not horrible) and then he seated us at the table I originally asked for.   We waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order and then another 35 minutes for our salad and black bean burger both with iced tea to come.   The gentleman at the table next to us vocally said he would need to get up and hunt down the waitress to get their check.  After our food arrived (It was well prepared and tasted good) a different table got up and started to leave.  They were stopped by an employee and they told them they waited over 15 minutes for someone to come and take their order and that they were going to the Mellow Mushroom and had received bad service here before and we never be back to try it again.   After they left the waiter for the table came and asked the employee what happened and he said \"They waited  3 or 4 minutes and left\"  Total LIE!  We love Pita Jungle but will never try this location again.",

Should've stuck with my usual fare because the sandwich is the worst thing I've ever ordered from there. The fish was only cooked and crispy on one side and the other side actually had a fishy smell which I've never encountered with cooked fish before. There really wasn't a lot of seasoning on the fish and was totally overpowered by the dry wheat bun that it was served in. The potatoes didn't have a lot of seasoning and were very bland. My girlfriend had a better experience with the falafel salad and really liked it. If and when we go back, I certainly will not be ordering that sandwich again, nor anything that's paired with the mahi mahi. Our waitress was excellent and very accommodating. The downtown location is always more consistent in regards to excellent service.",

Last night I ordered the portabella burger.  Portabella was overdone, shriveled, with no taste, and the garlic potatoes, which I usually can't get enough of, were inedible and left on the plate.  Last time here I ordered the chipotle black bean burger, which was fairly tasteless.  My husband got the ginger noodles on both occasions, and they were fair.  Service at the bar is good, but I don't think we will be back here soon.",

By that point we had already decided what we were going to eat as well as drink. There were 3 other tables seated after us, all of which received their food before ours. We ordered a gyro and spanakopita, and 2 waters. our waitress finally came back to us and said that they burned the spanakopita therefore they had to remake it. She then came back a second time and said that there were onions and tomatoes in my gyro (which I had asked to please leave off due to an allergy), so they had to remake that. We FINALLY received our meals and my gyro meat was burned. It was burned so badly that it just shattered into crumbles when I was trying to pick those parts off. I was sadly disappointed but didn't have the time to send it back. So I ate what I could.   Needless to say, it's not our waitress' fault but I couldn't eat half my gyro because I couldn't chew it and the time to get everything was terrible. I won't be heading back to this Pita Jungle though for lunch - no sense of urgency nor a sense of how to cook gyro meat.",

The kids meals are a great option! For just $5 you get a huge, healthy meal and a drink.   My favorite appetizers are the hummus and falafel. I also really like the baba ghanoush. They have various types of pita too-I prefer the Greek pita. If you are into veggie burgers, you will not be disappointed with theirs. For a great side dish-try the carmelized cauliflower-it is amazing!  If you aren't sure about what to order just ask your server. I haven't had a meal here that I didn't like. Enjoy!",

I won't spend time with the details, even though I was disappointed with this locations performance on that evening, it was really the recovery that was memorable. I did what most of us would do after a frustrating meal and service experience, I contacted the company through the corporate website and explained my discontent. What occurred next, was a series of  prompt, caring phone calls from the guest relations department, the restaurant general manager and  the Director of Purchasing George Strom. George and I had a frank discussion regarding the opportunities and solutions associated with them. George was genuinely concerned, not listening if the future, but in the present. After our discussion, George ended up refunding the cost of my meal and sent a gift card as well. As much as I appreciated that gesture, more importantly was the time George and his team spent listing to my concerns. George and PITA JUNGLE don't just say they care about the guest, they prove it in their actions which speaks to, and validates a phenomenal culture at PITA JUNGLE, well done and my family and I will again be regular guests at your wonderful establishment! WAY TO GO PITA JUNGLE!!! Signed, A Raving Fan Charles",

I had heard many GREAT, stellar raves about this place that I was really wanting and hoping to have my heels topped......But, unfortunately - NOT.    Now, don't get me wrong, the ambiance is cool, the vibe is cool, the service is cool.....the traditional lamb Gyro, was average.  First off, I had to salt the lamb itself a little more than I'd prefer to bring the flavors forward, and the Tzaziki sauce (which I ordered on the side, Thank God) had more sourness hints to it than it should have, and that I've experienced at many other Greek spots (that KILL and take names) on the Gyro I had today.  So, while I probably won't ever go back to PJ (unless I'm forced to by a mob of friends/colleagues), I don't bash its teeth out....I just turn my nose up to it because I know of a much better place that I'll continue to get my Gyro Pita's from - And, that place remains the Champ!...Crazy Jim's - 15th Ave - The Original! :)  Take my word for it - I'm ELITE!!!

    "text": "Love the food at this Pita Jungle. It's consistently good, every time!   It's strange how different locations vary in terms of quality.. I really don't care for the Pita Jungle closest to my house, for various reasons, but this one I will keep coming back for.   My favorite dish is the Lentil Fatoosh salad and it is very delicious! It's quite a hearty salad, piled high with lentils, rice, cucumbers, tomatoes, and caramelized onions (my fave!), and did I mention the fried pita bread on the side!? (It's really the best part of the salad, IMO!) It's the type of salad that leaves you full, but wanting more bites of it! Not many salads have that effect on me! ;)   Service is always really great too! I don't think I've ever had one bad experience here.",

Everyone can find something that suits them on the menu and they even have yummy cocktails and a bar at this location. Hummus anyone? Yes, please! I'm a big fan of the tzatziki, the Philly Chicken Pita and Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips.    Tip - if you are dining in for lunch either get there early to avoid the lunch rush or opt for a later lunch. This place gets slammed and sometimes you have to wait for a table. No complaints from me though, I enjoy walking around admiring their local artists work on display.",

Some coworkers where headed to Pita Jungle for lunch and I thought it would be  perfect time to try them out, get what I was craving and see how they are, so I placed my order.  I ordered the chicken shawarma pita with tahini & garlic sauce, pickles, tomatoes, onions & some mixed greens, Omg it was just what I wanted. The garlic sauce was not too over powering but you could tell it was there. My friend makes the best garlic sauce made with 40 cloves of garlic it's my favorite stuff, but for days you just sweat out garlic , but keep the vampires away, but this garlic sauce, it was perfect, hint of garlic to let you know it was their but not enough to offend anyone near you.  The pita bread was the perfect texture and the chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. This was a good shawarma pita wrap.  Happy to add Pita Jungle to my lunch rotation.",

    "text": "Went into pita jungle tonight and had the worst service I had ever had. The only thing good was the friendly host who seated us. About 5 minutes later another host gave us a friendly welcome when he noticed we had not been greeted by our waiter, he said he would grab our server. Finally our server came over with water. He was extremely awkward. He did not give us any type of greeting at all. He didn't introduce himself (say his name), and he didn't ask how we were doing. All he said was \"would you want any other drinks\", so my friend asked for a guava lemonade and she tried to finish her sentence by telling him what she wanted to eat but he interrupted her by saying \"hold on\" and proceeded to check a table next to us to see if how they were doing. After being cut off my friend put in her order and I put mine in. All he said was \"okay\" and took our menus and left. When he brought back my friends guava lemonade he quickly dropped it off and walked away (it was not busy). Our food came quickly. He just dropped it off and left, didn't ask if we needed anything else. After that he didn't check up on us how we were doing, never refilled our cups. He awkwardly came out with the check, he didn't ask if we were splitting and when I asked him if he could split it he looked really confused. I repeated what I ordered and what my friend ordered to let him know how to split it and we had to tell him a couple more times. Keep in mind each of us only ordered two very small plates. He came back with the checks and of course handed us the wrong books( easily could have handed us the right ones by checking our orders that we recited to him 4 times). We put our cards in immediately, he picked up the tables books next to us and looked at ours and kept walking, my friend stopped him to hand it to him and he then took it. He came back and dropped it off he didn't say bye to us, and didn't tell us to have a good night. We had to figure out his name from the nice host( or busser not sure) who grabbed the waiter for us. His name was Nick, was wearing a ball cap, stripped grey shirt, and probably really new. Just hope he can improve so people don't get that service again.",

    "text": "A few years ago my son was turning 5, I asked him where he wanted to go for his birthday dinner his reply Pita Jungle. So naturally we repeated our visit to Pita Jungle many times. My boy usually gets a special burrito, all the beans, some cheddar cheese wrapped up in 2 pitas, simple and delicious. Last night we had went out on an adventure and remembered there is a pita jungle on ray we have never been to. We called in our order, we were on our way out of town. I asked for chicken and hummus, that was great. My boy wanted his burrito. I told the girl on the phone, she sounded really put out by all of this and insisted that we get a bowl of beans and cheese and a pita on the side, I thought while traveling this is highly inconvenient for me but what ever, I'd rather comply that get my poor boys food spit on. So we show up after 20 min. of our call, it was ready. However we did get to stand there like idiots for 4 minutes... The damn bill was $5 more than usual, they put salsa on his bean bowl and rice and all of this other stuff he didn't want. I raised my son right, you eat it anyways, but he was disappointed, especially cause it's his all time favorite restaurant. I had to pay more to be rude to, and not get what I want, awesome! (sarcasm) Every other Pita Jungle worth my time, I guess the fancier the neighborhood the worse it is. To make things even better I saw 7 tickets that were ready, getting cold the cooks getting irritated and no one was running anything out. I know my business and this was poor. To make it all the better it wasn't even close to busy lots of open seating, and most of the customers looked hungry. Perhaps new staff is in order, something, I'm not asking for the world to cater to my feet, what I'm asking for all around when I choose to go in somewhere and spend my hard earned money and support other businesses is simply respect. And well I got none, and they made sure to hand me the percentage rate to tip. I left $2, more than I should of ever but hey what can I say, I didn't know it was all so bad.",

    "text": "Today was my first visit to this location.  The location is big but tight.  The outside seating is nice if you are a people watcher!  Inside is decorated with bicycles hanging from the ceiling, colorful lampshades for the overhanging fixtures, painted canvas on the walls.  The bar is made from some sort of metal or tin painted with cartoonish figures and designs.  Seating is tight but comfortable.  The open kitchen and high ceilings bring much space to the restaurant.  All the employees were young and hip with beards and leather jackets and stylish scarves.  The energy was lively and there was music playing but I couldn't tell what.  The volume of the actual room was louder than the music. The hostess was prompt to seat us where we chose.  Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive and smiled often.    Smiles are contagious :)    We ordered the Falafel on a bed of greens , Black Bean Burger (that will make you fart for 3 seconds straight when you get home) with pita instead of bread/bun, Coconut Curry Soup, Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini, and Brown Rice.  Oh yes, these items were fantastic.  It was my first experience with the cauliflower, and it was amazing.  Big chunks of steamed cauliflower drizzled in spicy tahini with caramelized onion strings in the middle.  I really really like it.  I'm going to make it at home now.  The falafel is something I have had here before and I always liked how Pita Jungle makes theirs.  Can't go wrong with the falafel.  The greens were fresh and abundant.  The black bean burger was good.  It had pieces of corn and cranberry in it so that was pretty rad.  Two of my favs.  The burger is just an average black bean burger though.  And if you are vegan you have to order it with the pita instead of bread/bun (according to the waitress).  The burger comes with garlic new potatoes, which are softened potatoes with garlic.  I like them, such a healthier alternative to crispy, deep fried french fries.  Brown Rice is just brown rice with parsley.  Coconut Curry soup was soooo delish.  My favorite out of everything today.  Creamy curry with chickpeas and peppers and cilantro.  Served with two crunchy pita chips on the side.  LOVED IT.  So good for not making it at home.  I gave this location of Pita Jungle 4 stars because the space was a bit tight and I didn't have like an epiphany or anything while eating my food.  I love the Pita Jungle concept of being trendy and hip but also serving fantastic, easy to create, HEALTHY alternatives to the other restaurants near by.  Pita Jungle doesn't break your wallet and you leave with a tummy full.",

    "text": "Had to wait a little for a table.  The first time we were seated was right by the open kitchen.  It was so loud that we asked to be moved.  We had to wait again for a new table.  The waiter wasn't overly friendly or helpful.  (In fact he spilled one of our glasses of wine.  He right away brought over a new glass (in case the first one had a crack in it) but didn't bring a replacement of the wine until we asked and even then he brought like 1 oz.  I'm sure more than that spilled and it seemed rude not to just replace the entire glass of wine.)  I had a cucumber cocktail that was so good I had two.  Also, we shared the sampler of hummus that was delicious.  For my meal I ordered the caprese plate with pita chips.  It was amazing.  Really, really good.  My only complaint is that it only came with 3 wedges of pita chip.  I needed more and was charged $2.99 for a small plate.  Darn!  If the food and drink weren't so good I would never come back!  ;)",

The staff is friendly, although they can be distant if it gets busy, but what place doesn't ? I do prefer to sit outside due to the decor in the restaurant the sound seems to bounce off the walls when the place is busy. My favorite item on the menu is definitely the Sharma wrap ! Their garlic hummus cant be beat!",

    "text": "We were incredibly disappointed with our experience here. We had a friend visiting from out of town and last Saturday decided we'd like to check out a new happy hour around town. We saw that Pita Jungle's happy hour looked pretty promising and waited an extra hour to go out to eat so we could get there at the beginning of happy hour (3pm). Note that this location (Ahwatukee) opened in the beginning of March, and the information on the restaurant website has still not been updated to include this location. We arrived around 3pm and were sort of greeted by the hostess. When we asked for our party of four to be seated on the near-empty patio, she made the \"I'm sorry\" face and proceeded to explain that all the tables out there are two-tops. The plastic, easily-movable tables. We waited for a couple seconds longer for her to say \"Well, I can see if we can work something out.\"  You do that. Don't think too hard.  While we were waiting we looked at the menu and found out that THIS location doesn't do a weekend happy hour. Thanks for updating that website. We almost decided to leave and come back another time, definitely wish we would have done that, but we were pretty darn hungry at this point. After pushing two tables together the hostess came back inside and grabbed four menus, then proceeded to greet another group, then flirt with a co-worker, THEN say \"you can come with me\" to our party with barely a glance in our direction.   We were seated in the very far corner of the large patio, as far away from the door into the restaurant as possible. I imagine this came into play later with our terrible service. Our server came, got our drink and app orders, and did well to check on the apps when we were about halfway through them. Our friend got a strawberry banana smoothie and it was delicious. We ordered the baba ghanoush as we were promised that it was extra smoky, and we love it that way. When it arrived we were surprised to find a pile of lumpy, stringy eggplant that clearly needed another round or two in the food processor. The texture was gross to the point where my SO couldn't eat it, and she is usually crazy about baba ghanoush. It was smoky, however. Our friend ordered the stuffed grape leaves, and they were fine. Comparable to what you would be served at a fast food Mediterranean place - definitely nothing special.  For our entree we ordered the black bean burger. We have had the burger once before (take-out from the Arcadia location) and liked it, but it is SO mushy and hard to eat as a burger. It just falls apart very quickly. We like the cranberries in the burger, very nice touch. The toppings both last time and this time were disappointing - the onions were cut so thickly that the taste of onion took over and it was hard to enjoy the burger. The tomato slice was incredibly thick and included part of the hard center near the stem (again, both last time and this time) and we had to do a lot of doctoring to enjoy the toppings.   Here is where we started to be severely unimpressed. While we were eating our entrees, our server was no where to be seen. Not once did she return to the table until about 15 minutes AFTER we were finished eating. During the meal we had to ask a hostess to refill our four empty waters, and then another server to refill another one later on. At the end of the meal, after we had been sitting for quite a while, we finally had to ask another server if our server was still around. She replied \"Well, I hope so!\" and went to find her. It should be noted again that this was about 4:00 on a Saturday afternoon. It was NOT busy and there were plenty of waitstaff. Our server eventually showed up looking a little sheepish and took our plates. We asked for the bill and lo and behold, it took another five minutes to get the bill out to us. We didn't even consider waiting to have her come back outside to pick up the credit cards - we just walked them into the front desk. We had written clearly on the back of the receipt how much should go on one credit card and how much to put on the second. After waiting for the hostess to track down our server to run the cards, we got them back to find that she had gotten the amounts correct, but the cards switched around. Really? Really?  Yeah...we won't ever be coming back. Left feeling disappointed and frustrated at having spent any money on this dining experience.  EDIT: Changed to three stars. After our last review we were contacted and given $25 credit at the Ahwatukee location. We returned for happy hour since that was our original plan. Our server was fantastic, very attentive and positive, fun to talk with (didn't tell them about our credit until the end). We had a hard time spending $25 at Happy Hour with all the $1-$3 tapas. Good margaritas for $3.50. We had all the vegetarian tapas and they were delicious. The only thing we'll still be staying away from is the grape leaves -unimpressive both times. We'll be back, but probably only for happy hour.",

We usually arrive as a group of 6 after a movie night out with friends when we leave the AMC Ahwatukee. A 30-45 minute wait is common for us. As you'd expect from a Pita Jungle the food is great!",

    "text": "I usually love going to Pita Jungle.  I have frequented both the Apache location and the location in Glendale.  But last night I took my husband to the one on Ray for the first time since it had opened.  I had actually been there two days prior with my family.  I noticed on both occasions that the manager was walking around and making snide comments about the employees.  Huffing and puffing while standing at one of the computers.  Yesterday, though, we walked over from the theater and I heard the manager on the phone standing in the empty patio seating area complaining to someone quite loudly about the staff, again.  This time someone was just standing around when they should have been prepping their station, someone else was late coming back from a break.  I know things like this happen, but it doesn't make me feel very good when the manager feels so poorly of the staff.  I think it would have been better if he would have taken the call in the back ally, maybe in an office..but not some where that incoming customers can hear him.  I just didn't expect that every time I went there I would hear him complaining.    I'll go back...but because of the food....not the management.",

    "text": "I'm sort of torn on this review because when I went to Pita Jungle a few weeks ago pats of it were really good, and other parts were really bad.  First off I guess I'll start with the bad. I went with my BF around 1:30, the lunch rush seemed basically over, there were a good amount of people in there though. When we walked in it took about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us and to get seated. It looked like the manager was standing around chatting with employees. Another 5+ minutes went by and a girl came and took our drink orders, a different girl brought us our drinks then she said she would get our server. 10 more minutes went by and I was wondering what was taking so long since they weren't very busy and she came over and asked us for our drink order, once she saw we had our drinks she took our food order an that was basically the last we saw of her. Yet another girl brought us our food and no one came over for re-fills or anything which was disappointing. Our \"waitress\" did come back to give us the check and ask how everything was. We didn't tip very much since we had like 5 different girls help us..or something like that.  Now the good! The gyro was amazing, a great portion that I could barely finish. My BF got falafel that was also great. Loved the atmosphere and the \"feel\" of this place. I'll definitely go back and try to see if the service is any better. If the service wasn't so terrible this place would be a solid 4 stars! Worth a try for the yummy food...but still, so unimpressed with the professionalism here..or lack there of.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying giving this Pita Jungle location 1 star is generous. When I first heard that this location was opening, I was excited! Not many places around here have healthy, fast, & good food! I decided to take some of my girlfriends out for dinner one night and thought I would try out the newer location on Ray Rd (I live downtown and ALWAYS go to that location) We walked in the door around 6:00 on a Tuesday night, we were immediately ignored by a couple of young girls hosting while talking to some other co-workers. We stood at the front door for 4 minutes before being greeted (I am a server myself so I notice little things like that). When the host came up to us, she barley said anything to us, asked how many and sat us at a table directly infront of the kitchen next to the takeout stand. She put the menus down on the table and left. 8 minutes go by and no server has greeted our table yet, we were about to leave. Right as we were getting up, our server, Halley came by and greeted us and apologized for the wait and explained that she was dealing with a messed up ticket for another customer. As I said before, I am a server myself, so I understand these things. The place was pretty busy and we got to ordering our drinks, it took her 10 minutes to bring us our margaritas! We tried not to get very rude with her, so we then ordered our apps, we chose the Chicken & Hummus as well as the chicken combo. The chicken and hummus came out wrong, we ordered regular hummus and we got the green hummus. Also, the chicken was extremely cold. The chicken combo was cold but we ate it because we were afraid to order anything else and have it be cold too. We just were going to leave and take our money elsewhere. Needles to say, our experience at Pita Jungle will be un-forgettable.... but the icing on the cake to our dining experience was walking by the kitchen to the bathroom and hearing the conversations in the kitchen. I stopped and acted like I was watching the flow of the kitchen, but I was really interested in hearing the big red headed kitchen manager screaming at her employees. I don't know if it was a joke or not, but her employees looked de-motivated.... I wouldn't blame them.  Some other locations to check out: Downtown Phoenix, Arcadia, Tempe & Scottsdale.",
