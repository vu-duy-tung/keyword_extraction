Where the particular item I ordered was strange for my taste buds it was good. I had the Jamaican chicken salad with the jerk chicken. I must admit the chicken was cooked perfectly and the flavor was delicious. I also had a bite of my friends' chilli, also tasty. Finally, it also amazed me to know they accept children before 9pm. I know, I know who brings their kid to a bar? In my defense, I learned this eve that they earn the title bar AND Grill for a reason, that reason? A six page menu with plenty to choose from. I am fairly certain we will return before seasons end. Oh, my waitress was awesome and cooperated in bringing my bill right away so I could be sure we got out before 9 :)",

How romantic, right?!   Anyway, I always have a good time at Dukes. They have about a million TVs, pool tables, shuffleboard, darts, Buck Hunter etc... Definitely a little something for everyone! I find their drinks very reasonably priced - it seems like they always have specials on beers and shots.   The food is pretty decent for bar food. I'm a big fan of the buffalo style wings, they're nice and big and juicy. Nom nom nom!   Dukes also provides a free cab service if you happen to indulge in too many spirits. Don't drink and drive, y'all!  My only complaint is that once or twice I've caught some attitude from a bartender, but that's probably a fluke and service is usually fine for a dive bar.",

People were there to watch the Super Bowl, yet they didn't have all the TVs tuned in for it. We asked, since the ones over the bar had every other TV on another station and it was distracting. Waitress said they are a sports bar so they needed to play any other sports on TV. Watching a story about Allen Iverson or Curling was not worth even having on, but they wouldn't change the stations.  Ordered Chili Cheese Fries that come with cheese and onions. Our server asked if we wanted cheese and onions?!?  So what are chili cheese fries without the cheese? They came, cold and without onions.  I ordered ice tea and found out that refills cost money. Who does that?? Asked for dessert menu and was told they don't serve any desserts because their kitchen is too small. The owner, I presume, had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert because we don't drink?  People who drink, eat desserts. Not a place I will go back too. Wasn't impressed, at all.",

    "text": "There are no words to describe how rude and absurd of a man the owner is. After seeing that Duke's had the channel our favorite football team was playing on, we decided to stop in for some appetizers and sports. For the first portion of our visit, everything was okay. We ordered chips and wings, all of which were average but sufficient. On top of this we had a friendly enough server.   As many do, upon eating we stuck around to watch more of the game. That's when everything turned sour... or more specifically we had the delight of meeting the owner. Now, the owner was someone we noticed from the beginning of our meal, as he sat at the bar eating nachos and cheering against the U of A as they played their game (not for their opponent, just enthusiastically against them). Upon realizing we were Wildcat fans we soon became recipients of many dirty looks, but remained unfazed thinking he was just another restaurant patron. As the half progressed the looks became more frequent, and we realized that despite being quiet and respectful customers, he clearly had an issue with us. During halftime he made it known, as he rushed to our table, angrily grabbed our napkins off the table, and then proceeded to condescendingly yell at us, demanding we order more food or get out. We understood his point (although it could have been delivered more kindly), and began picking out new items to order. We then ordered, only to be angrily reapproached by the owner five minutes later yelling at us and asking whether we had chosen something to order. We explained that we had, at which point he then said, \"WAIT!!! Are you guys 21?!\" We replied that one of the three of us were, promoting him to yell at the top of his lungs, \"STOP. STOP. YOU CANNOT BE HERE WITHOUT ADULTS!\" We had seen many children and had seen no signs explaining this policy, and were left extremely confused, and with an entire restaurant of people turned in their seats to watch him yell at us, with their jaws dropped. He then said our order was cancelled and we had to leave.   In all honesty this review doesn't do the situation justice at all. The owner was an EXTREMELY rude and aggressive drunk man, who singled us out over a sports rivalry (there were MANY other tables of people watching sports without food on their tables, and we had done literally nothing to draw his attention or disapproval). He treated us extremely immaturely and condescendingly, and showed no evidence of skills in customer service. In fact, one of his staff even came up to us and apologized for the owner being a \"drunk a$$hole.\" We left sad and embarrased, not to mention angry. Worst experience ever.",

The buffalo sauce had a good kick and the chicken was grilled strips - it was all stuffed into a tortilla with grilled onions and a few peppers and lettuce. They forgot my side of dressing and the fries were standard frozen, but crisp and the slaw was good, but not homemade. They serve late, so if your in need, try the wrap, you will be filled up.

Pros: (+) $4 mimosas. What a deal! (+) Awesome atmosphere (cool laid back sports bar) (+) A plethora of TVs so you can watch whatever game, wherever in the bar (+) Bartender was friendly  (+) Games as well - shuffleboard and billiards from what I saw, there may be more but I don't know (+) Looked like a sufficient food menu (+) Tons of seating  Cons: None!

The questions were not too easy nor too hard and everyone seemed to be having fun with it. We came in 5th but in our defense, there were only 2 of us playing and all other teams had like 5 -8 people. The only complaint is that the game, the jukebox and the trivia emcee were all playing so it was hard to hear the questions. They should turn off the other stuff when trivia os on.

It's right on the green belt, so it's convenient for cyclists, disc golfers, and dog walkers who use the park. The property kind of has two sections to its patio with both overlooking the park.   There is a lot of space inside with tons of TVs. There are pool tables, shuffle board, arcade games, etc. They have bar trivia twice a week, and the regular emcee is friendly.   I usually just drink beer here as far as alcoholic drinks go. They usually have at least four IPAs on tap which I wish they'd rotate in some other ales. If you order a pitcher, they'll give you an ice chiller.   I think the food is good. It's not fried dive bar food. They have some unique dishes. I usually order the sliders, steak salad, fried shrimp, or chicken tenders.   The service is great. Lots of personable bartenders and waitresses who are attentive and friendly. They'll put on any game you request, too, without hassle. The owner is regular, and he'll say hi to customers.   It's a great spot for catching a game, pit stop for park guests, bar trivia night, or if you live in the area, for pregaming or capping off a night in Old Town or on Mill.",

That's how you get group synergy and get your bar in the national rankings. Helps us drink more, too.",

I walked into the bar and took a seat. I was immediately greeted by a nice lady. She handed me a menu and I was a little overwhelmed with how big it was. I quickly scanned it and saw they had a breaded pork tenderloin! Coming from the Midwest this is a staple I had very frequently coming from Iowa. I placed my order and realized they had a ton of TVs! My food arrived very quickly and I destroyed the pork tenderloin and tator tots! This place was a quick in and out for lunch while the staff was very friendly! They checked on me over 10 times start to finish. Thanks for the great service and excellent food!",

The owner needs to take responsibility of his establishment and not let his staff run his restaurant. Remodeling isn't going to improve sales it's the staff.  Have I mentioned how bad the staff is there. Could be a great place but no one cares there. Don't bother going to this place.

They knew tonight would be a busy night with the asu college game but they still ran out of the daily special. I think this is piss poor management from an owner who has supposedly been in the bar business for 30 plus years. Maybe he should pay more attention to his business instead of if he has a full drink in front of him. The servers are great and friendly. The bar would be dead if it wasn't for his daughter running this place during the day. On dozens of occasions a random non-Arizona sports game has been on the main screen instead of the diamondbacks or coyotes game. This might as well be a dodgers home city bar because the dodgers are always on the big screen. When we ask the bartender if we can watch the diamondbacks they say the owner is at home watching the bar on security cam and wants the dodgers on. Does he think the dodgers will bring more business?  Lol...forget ever coming here if you are a  hockey fan. The owner hates hockey and it's never on the big screen. This bar has only survived this long due to the area lacking good restaurants. Hopefully that'll change soon with the new development happening on McDowell. The only reason I come back to this place is because it's within walking distance. He needs to remember that there's  more on than shitty Montana football.",

    "text": "There's something about sports bars in Scottsdale and Phoenix that's always makes me feel like I'm getting nickeled and dimed. I found Dukes to be the best out of that group though.  Dukes reminds me of a Doc & Eddies North. It doesn't feel corporatized like, say,  Gallagers.  Dukes is kinda divey, feels like your large local bar and it did a good job accommodating our groups for college football games.  I even saw a private area reserved for fans watching the University of North Dakota. If your bar can accommodate fans of an FCS  school, I'm impressed.   TVs are spread throughout the bar, there's a pool table and games and they are consistently open Saturday mornings so you can watch your team's 9:00 am kickoff (unlike some bars).  I haven't been to Dukes in a long while. I once watched a game there when a drunk football fan tried to fight me because I tried to explain to him two teams from the same conference cannot play in the Superbowl. He felt like I was showing up his football intelligence.   He was there alone and I was with a group. When I told him I wouldn't go into the parking lot with him he went to the bar and stared me down   waiting for me to leave. One of the ladies I was with complained to the staff. He offered her a free drink for her inconvenience. She then explained to him that it wasn't her he wanted to fight.  Okay, so the staff isn't brilliant. It's still a good place to watch football. Unfortunately I can't comment on the food because I don't remember eating any. I think Tempe and Chandler sports bars are better values when it comes to food.   I'd go back to Dukes over Upper Deck, Gallagers, Half Moon, Full moon or Blue Moon.",

But don't be fooled by the two pages of salad options, they are all served with the premix iceburg lettuce bags. YUK again!    I really love this place because it looks SUPER small from the outside, but is actually pretty big on the inside!  They have like 10-12 pool tables and they are in pretty good condition. They have 2 shuffle board, 2 electronic dart boards, and at least 4 old school dart boards with the chalk board scoring system!    I definitely recommend this place if you live in the area, the bartendar's and waitresses, or waiters, will get to know you fast,, and your experience will get better every time.  Just don't go there with hopes of having dinner.  Bar food and late night snacking types o' meals!",

    "text": "Not a bad spot.  They have a pretty decent selection of beers on tap, for reasonable prices.  Plenty of TV's.  They have two rooms of pool tables, with more tables than the majority of bars in Phoenix.  Most importantly, they have all of the sports channels.  As a Boston fan, this is the only place that I've found that has NESN.  They are very willing to put on a dedicated TV for you if you ask...not always with sound, but it's better than nothing!  Plus, there usually aren't too many college douche-bags there, so it's generally a chill atmosphere.  Also, their back patio is awesome, as it looks out onto the greenbelt, rather than a parking lot like most places in the valley.",

While having a conversation with the manager about a very small issue (and we where having a pleasant conversation) this old man walked up and stood behind the manager.  I asked the manager, \"who is this gentleman?\"  Turned out to be the owner who proclaimed, \"I OWN THE F*****G PLACE, THAT\"S WHO I AM....WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!?!?!\"  I asked the manager if I'd said something wrong and he stood quiet.  It was clear he deals with this a lot.  Maybe it's because his boss sits at the bar and drinks and then tries to interject when he clearly shouldn't.  The story goes on from here, but I digress.  My friends and I paid out tab for one pitcher of beer (so we where there less than 20 min) and took our business elsewhere.  After spending $286.00 at the other location it has become our new hangout.  There is another post here about the owner kicking out a Kings fan....I find that story COMPLETELY believable after what we had happen.  I wouldn't spend ten cents in this place all because of the owner!",

Pool, Shuffleboard and Darts are available as well as other games. Electronic cards and racing. The service is always amazing even if theyre very busy. I've never had a bad waitress here.   The best part is that they have a giant private room and guess how much it is to rent it out? It's completely free. You just have to book it in advance. They could have easily charged a lot for that private room since it includes its own shuffleboard and pool table.   Also they have a FREE designated driver who will take you home. All they ask is that you tip them. There's no reason to ever go anywhere else.",

    "text": "Lame.....................  So I was looking for a good dive bar near my house. I am not talking Apache Rd in Tempe divey, where the patrons could possibly stab you, but a good low key hang out. I need a Cheers.  When I read the Michael C.'s great review that said they have free car service to pick you up and drop you off I thought I had found my place!  OH how I hate being wrong!  I went here with a friend Saturday night, after waiting 30 minutes for the car to pick us up, the driver told us he had no change so we could tip him. So we ended up giving him in a tip what a cab would have cost us. It was obvious he was scamming us, but what is the point of confronting him? I needed him to take me home later.  Now this one won't be a negative for the guys, but there were way more chicks than guys. I prefer a few more guys in a bar.  But I guess the biggest missing element for me was fun people to talk to. I love going to a bar with a friend, having a few drinks, and meeting fun people to talk to. Those people weren't here. It was a weird crowd, and not in a good way. One weird solo guy at nearby table was actually leaning in and listening in on our conversation, then he would make comments out loud, but to himself, about what we said. His back was to us the whole time. The whole thing was a little One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The music and the karaoke were entertaining, but I prefer a bar that has interesting people who you want to meet.  The waitress was almost completely devoid of personality. The little that was there obviously hated being at Dukes! She sucked, and she screwed up our bill.  One lady who worked there named Cynthia stopped by for a minute, and she was cool and friendly. Thanks for the 5 minutes of friendliness Cynthia!  Another negative was the brightness of the bar. Hello, bars should not be that bright. You needs just the right combo of alcohol and dim lighting to meet your future ex-boyfriend.  Just an overall disappointment! Unfortunately, I won't be back there anytime soon.",

And when we were waiting for our ride (plus on the car service availability) some weird freak of nature walked up to us outside.  He was talking to me in some weird radio announcer voice in my ear.

The odd, also very good, part about that menu is the salad selection. Duke's has two pages of its menu dedicated to salads. While not something you'd expect from a sports bar, it's nice to know that there still is a healthy selection I can choose from while watching a game.

I went to Dukes last Sunday for the Chargers game and it was packed.  I was pretty happy to see a sports bar within stumbling distance to my house that was actually a lot bigger than it looks from outside.  Sure, its in a strip mall but I can overlook that.    What I cant overlook is how downright miserable our server looked when she was actually anywhere near our table, which wasnt often.  I almost deducted two stars for this, since other friends of mine had been there the day before and said their service from another girl was equally as poor.    What I do like about Dukes:  Cheap drinks Bloody Mary bar A billion TVs Shuffle Board The layout and big space Free Wi-Fi (No I did not take my laptop, but for those fantasy football players that must have their scores immediately, it seemed like a good thing)  All in all, a good place to watch the game, whoever youre cheering for.  Maybe service at the bar (instead of at a table) is better.",

But another half hour goes by with  no signs of our food or even a heads up when it might be coming out. Now we are late coming back from our lunch break and we just wanted to pay for our drinks and go. We felt as it was forced upon us to stay and did not feel like it was right.  So long story short. She did not give us any discount on her mistake,  they gave us to go boxes.  Messed up everyone's order in the to go box,  and each paid 13 dollars for a lunch that tasted so un-cooked that half of us ended up throwing it away... If you do go here..

I mean, the friendliest bartender I've ever met. This place has so many things going for it, but so many things against as well. For starters, it's located in a hidden useless strip mall behind a Denny's and a Peter Piper Pizza. It's also trying to be too much. It's like a local dive bar with lofty aspirations and a high self-esteem.  It's totally worth going to, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone unless they asked specifically for something exactly like this... but such a request would be unlikely. They have a long list of things going on here, so if this is close enough to your neighborhood to make it your neighborhood bar - you could do worse.",

Everything you could ever want in a sports bar, right?  Well here is what you don't want. It is SO loud in there you can barely have a conversation.  Our server was missing most of the night and when he did show up he screwed up our orders.    I give it three stars, 1 for the wall of TVs showing different games, 1 for the menu that has a lot of variety including 2 pages of salads, and finally 1 star for the fact that they have a bloody mary bar.  This alone will get me back in there to watch football on a Sunday morning.",

Ordered 2 small fountain drinks for my kids ($3.90 total) and they wanted $1.00 each for refills. We could have stayed there all night getting free refills and Dukes still would not have lost money.  Spoke with the manager but she stood her ground on the rule. Food was average for bar food. Perks were bike parking by the patio so you could sit buy your bike if you're on a ride through the park and free WiFi. In the future we'll be stopping at Zipps instead.  Sorry to see them lose future business trying to squeeze a couple extra dollars out of me on one visit.",

One of the organizers has frequented for a few years and notes that it's never busy one night over the other. You'll see a variety of patrons at Duke's, it's not a typical place for one group or another.  Service is kind of hit or miss, sadly. One evening the server was on point! He knew when to swing by & ask for refills, the food didn't take long to order and be delivered. And it appeared had a bunch of tables- my props to him. One of my more recent trips was the opposite, surprisingly since they weren't terribly busy. The guy seemed very out of it. He walked by our table a few times without acknowledging our attempts to get his attention, and also disappeared the entire time it took for our food to be delivered (25-30min). Cashing out was quite painful with him too.   The food is just kind of meh. I was told they pride themselves on salads, but I've not been impressed- over-dressed, not a lot of anything else. The totchos are decent, nothing else is really worth mentioning. I'll probably return since my friends love it and I love trivia.",

Most servers very friendly and the owner Jacki works hard to ensure customers and staff are happy. It's sad that one server attitude prompts a person to write a response after 4 weeks of 3 or more visits each week to be motivated to put a 1 star on the site. For the second time, the server adds other persons drinks to my bill by mistake. the first time I mentioned it, I ended up just paying, it was minimal, and didn't want to make a scene. He didn't offer to take it off. The second time I stood up for myself and he got angry. He wouldn't even listen to my response...It was his mistake again.  I am writing this review because of his attitude and not the $. He wouldn't even listen and stormed off. My tip for his fellow bartenders would have been 4x the amount of the wrong amount on the bill. I tip very well according to standards. Because of his attitude, they lost their tip AND I will go elsewhere 3x/week and not go back. The ironic part is, 30 minutes prior to my situation, the person next to me asked him to take a charge off his bill he never ordered and the sameserver did with no complaint. So, I know for a fact its just not me for wrong charges. I wonder how many other people this person overcharged, or wrongly charged ??? Me 2x and my neighbor in one week. I haven't disputed another bar bill in 5 years, so I guess it hit a nerve... just sayin'",

    "text": "Duke's was a semi-regular hangout for me and my friends for their trivia and karaoke nights.  We were willing to overlook the meh food (seriously, their food used to better, now it's really not good), outdated decor, too loud TVs because it was fun to participate in those nights.  But after our last experience we are boycotting Duke's from now on.  We came with a group of 10 people.  From the start my friend told our server that we were going to split tabs.  NO mention from the server that she would not split our tab.  After eating my meal, I ask the server for my bill.  NO mention from the server that she would not split our tab.  End of the night there is a beer that has not been assigned to anyone's tab.  We all double-check our bills and they are all correct -- no one at our table ordered that beer.    Instead of the server thinking \"hey maybe it's my mistake\" (after all the restaurant had earlier tried to serve us a Dr Pepper we didn't order and a burger we didn't order.... so it's not like they've got the most organized system in the world) she shot at us \"I'm bringing the manager\" and stomped off.  Honestly, it was like a $4 beer.  I was about to pay for it, even though I hadn't ordered it, until the server started acting like such a brat.  Then the manager comes over and proceeds to berate us and tell us \"this is why we don't split tabs for groups this big\"  Me and my friends are all thinking \"uhhh... okay... then why DID you?\"  My friend even told the manager \"we want to fix this mistake, we just want to figure out what happened.\"  But of course, instead of working with us to solve the problem, the manager just chooses to ignore my friend and keep lecturing.  Instead of talking back to her, which I really felt like doing, we just sat and let her talk down to us (even though we had done nothing wrong) and left and vowed never to return.  In the future we'll probably stick to going to Thirsty Lion for trivia nights.  The food is a LOT better, the atmosphere is nicer, and most importantly we've never been yelled at like we were little children when going there....  We even won a $20 gift certificate for getting 2nd place at trivia, but NONE of us are willing to go back there so looks like it will go un-used!",

I was sharing pitchers of beer with three other dudes and it was all I could do to get more beer. It took about thirty minutes to flag down the waitress and then get the next one delivered. Half an hour with nothing to drink. Add to that that our food took a really long time too. Now, it being trivia night i was prepared to cut the kitchen some slack... But our food came out an hour after we ordered it and it was cold. Even great food isn't that good cool cold and this was just standard bar food.  The trivia on the other hand was a high point. Their announcer is clear and repeats stuff often enough that everyone gets it. The trivia is diverse and interesting and I felt like everyone had a chance to win it. (We got third!)  Ultimately however, we brought a designated driver because we wanted to drink and we left pretty sober.",

My friends sister is 15 years old but my friend is her legal guardian. I asked \"why do we need  and ID when we are just ordering food and water\". She says that's the rules. I said I've been here many times and never carded when eating and ordering food. She said well to bad that's the rules and I can grab a manager of you would like. I said yes please. She sent someone over named Mark. He didn't introduce himself as the manager but said what's the problem. We explained and he said that the rule. We said we understand that but we are ordering a water. He said that's the rule. I said you know I've been here several times and have inconsistent service. I don't understand why ordering a water props a waitress to ask for an id. He said that rule. I asked why is it when I go to Applebee's I can order food and a water and not get carded. Why can I go to Philly's down the street and do the same thing with out getting carded. He said of you don't like it then you can leave. I said I've had several issues with this place and have written bad reviews and corrected them because management has fixed the problem. But this is ridiculous. He said then why do you keep coming back if it's that bad. I said because it wasn't managements fault it was the staff but this time it's management which means that this place is dysfunctional on all levels. We walked out angry and upset and with no resolution. I believe most restaurants would have handled this much differently. I prefer to give them my business and money.  Also forgot to add It was 6:30pm when we went in not 9 where I would understand being carded.",

I got up went to the men's room came back to my table paid the bill left a tip as usual . I stood up to leave when the owner got in my face screaming at me !! He was holding a beer and you can tell he had to much to drink. He was yelling at me at the top of his lungs to get the hell out of his place and never come back. I had my side arm on my hip. Been going there with it on my hip for the last 4 yrs never had a problem . I always look for signs that say no firearms allowed . I have never seen one posted anywhere. He stood there inches from my face yelling at me. Great way to treat your customers . Screaming I don't want packers here!!!!! So I guess I'm a packer fine I am using my constructional rights. I told him if this is his he treats his clients that I'd never return. He said fine I won't let your kind in here. Then proceeded to yell get the fuck out of here!!! I turned and said don't worry I'm not ever coming back to this place. Then yelled what are you going to do ?? You wanna pull in me. I said are you fucking nuts!!! He kept screaming as I walked away.  Sad he could not had been civilized and walked up to me and said sir I guess you did not know we don't allow guns in here. Please do not bring it again. But no he had to be abusive and very mean. This is precisely the type of person I try to stay away from. Reason being they are unstable and you just don't know what they will do .  When he asked me to pull on him this told me just how disturbed this man is. He should be ashamed of himself. I wear the gun to protect myself and other people from crazy nuts like him. I respect the law and abide by the law .",

We waited about an hour for our food.  My French Dip was good and the burgers were good, according to my co-workers.  I cannot give this place more than three stars due to the fact that grabbing a quick bite turned into a two and a half our ordeal.",

The service was bad, but I can't blame it on the servers. Even on a busy football Sunday, you seat yourself. The poor servers are running around and it takes forever to get anyone's attention and to get anything.   Oh... And the no specials on Sunday / during football game is another negative.",

However, while they claim the kitchen closes at midnight, bar at 1AM, the last couple times I've called in they've closed the kitchen well ahead of midnight. This gets frustrating as a frequently returning customer who enjoys their select group of late-night food options.  I will no longer be going to Duke's because of this, sadly. They have some good food options and their attempt to be available later in the evening is wonderful but inconsistent.",

The place is huge, tables to the left, bar in the middle and two rooms with table and games to the right. What i appreciated about it is that it isn't too dark, and since they play the audio or one of the games on it isn't too loud. Too hot to enjoy the large patio but will be out there once it cools down. The TV's, ohhh the TV's, they are everywhere. I loved the wall of tv's because I could zero in on the game I wanted to watch and easily check in on it. The number and visibility of the TV's is one thing that makes this a step above other sports bars in the area.  The service was great. Our waitress was Aubrey and she was working hard for her tables. She was not just pleasant but also had a good sense of humor also.   I'm in a sports bar so I'm expecting good sports bar food, and they met that expectation. The Patty Melt is one of the better patty melts I've had and adding Tots as a side is a bonus. The Nachos were large, tasted like homemade chips and a good amount of beef. The half order of Chicken Cesar was large enough for a single menu.  Would I go back? Yes, and I will!",

Dukes does well because people go for the staff, friendly atmosphere and all of the other great things that they have going for them.

I've had some really great times here over the years AND there've been some times that I wish my friends would just let me forget already.  Karaoke, build your own bloody mary, $6 pitchers and rock -n- roll nachos are all part of why I never mind coming here.  One word of caution, though, if you're drinking said $6 pitchers, it's probably flat beer and not too fresh. Often times, you can see a server dipping a straw into the pitcher and briskly giving the beer a stir, causing it to \"head\" up a bit before bringing it to your table. But it's piss beer anyway, so you pretty much get what you pay for.  My favorite times coming here are during games in which hometown teams are doing well and the owner gives away free shots. Also, the patio is nice during the winter.  Oh yeah, free car ride home if you're too hammered to drive. So please tip the driver!  Cheers!",

A few weeks ago, I was sitting at the bar and I noticed that there was one girl there who is an LA Kings fan. It was the night that the Kings eliminated the Coyotes from the playoffs. She was (needless to say) excited. She didn't appear drunk, nor was she obnoxious nor taunting the many Coyotes fans. However, I witnessed the owner demand her to leave. I felt this was unfair, as it seemed the only reason he had was simply because she was cheering for the opposing team.  I've been to Dukes when the Lakers were the star attraction, so you can't tell me that this is an \"Arizona\" bar. She was treated unfairly. Period.  Because of this fact,I will not be back. There are far too many other sports bars (with better food, better service, and may I say better hospitality).",

They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.  Mixed drinks use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection at a rather high price point. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on special.  The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from freezer-to-fryer or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.  One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons \"how is everything?\" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.  In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere.",

I asked for 2 things of blue cheese and 1 more ranch for the chicken before we tried it, they cost .75 each mind you; we tried the chicken and didnt like it so we asked for something else which she got for us but still charged us for the dipping sauce we didn't even use. I think she should have taken them off my bill since they never got used, but I guess she needed the money.

Everything tasted like frozen microwave food.   Furthremore, the service was not very good.   Our server was very forgetful and non-attentive to us.   I have no reason to ever come to this place again.   I will not provide a recommendation for this place.",

As we sat down the waitress asked us what we wanted to drink. Everyone at the table ordered water. She then asked for ID because \"you have to be 21 to be in here\". She did not say \"21 or with an adult or guardian\". She wouldn't serve us or even discuss what our situation was without sending a manager over. I am 25 and legal guardian of my 16 year old sister who was with us (she was the only under aged person). sitting next to us are two adults with their young child. The manager, Mark, was 10x worse than the waitress. He was a smart ass and after hearing our issue, he laughed and said \"why do you come here then\". This place is absolutely awful. Never in my life have I been treated this way at ANY customer service based place of business. Disrespectful, out of line, judgmental and rude don't even begin to touch on the service we got here.",

    "text": "Hidden in a random strip mall, there's a good chance plenty of people pass Dukes without realizing that they are missing out. Now, this is a dive bar so like all other dive bars, you have to take it for what it is. The floors could be shinier, the bathrooms could be cleaner, but then it wouldn't be an authentic dive bar would it?  Duke's is a solid choice when looking for a place to play some bar games, watch sports and enjoy some drinks. It's spacious and great for large groups. You name the game, they've got it: several pool tables, darts, shuffle board, Foosball, etc. TVs line the walls with your favorite sport teams playing. With the reasonably priced drinks, this is a good place to pregame before a sporting event or set up shop and watch it on TV.   I've hosted a party at Dukes and it's a perfect location because of the size, TVs, games and most importantly, because they don't charge to rent out the party room. So, you can have up to 100 people in a party room without any fees! And, for a girl on a budget trying to throw a low key party, this was a perfect choice.   So I suggest Dukes if you are looking for a dive bar night on the town and you don't want to just sit around when you get there.",

We ordered bloody Mary's, which were very watered down and the only garnishment they provided was one green olive (no chaser either). We also ordered the chicken finger appetizer, which was disgusting.. My first bite, had to be discarded as it had a chewy/rubbery texture.  We decided to give them another chance that evening and stopped in for a beer. The bartender had a pitcher sitting on top of the counter which she used to make his drink, she then topped it off from the keg (probably to add foam and keep it a little cool).  Lastly, they have a tub with bottles of beers, I assume to should be filled with ice however in this case the ice melted and it was just sitting in water (which I would assume is not keeping them at the right temp). Another bartender decided to put their hand in the tub to swirl the water around and then proceeded to help a customer.",

We decided to try them out for Game 2 of the World Series (TVs line the walls/ceilings so you won't miss a view regardless where you sit) and to try our hand at trivia night. Dinner was good- nothing over-the-Top great, but I ordered the BBQ chicken salad ($9 for any salad Wednesday), and my friend orders the buffalo chicken sandwich, which looked delicious. The nachos have actual nacho cheese on them, so I'd likely pounce on that and their wings when we go back. Trivia was a solid time- starts at 7:30pm and lasts about 2 hours. The highlight of our night was our waitress, Tonda. She was involved in our conversation and attentive to what we needed. She also was nice enough to bring us birthday cards to send to ourselves for $10 off on our bdays next year! They also have a cute patio we want to try out now that the weather is getting nice.",

Now let me say that the burger and salad tasted very good. The salad ( cob salad ) was very small for $12, I could of ate 3 of them. They give you a pathetic amount of salad dressing and if you want more ? BAM ! .75 cents un-fricken real. Refill on a tiny glass of coke ? BAM ! $1.00.

    "text": "This dive bar is in the corner of Miller and Mcdowell in a strip mall.Don't be fooled by its shabby exterior this place is Huge with tons of tv's,pool tables,darts and what not. They also have outdoor seating and a smoking patio.  During the day service is slow even when the place is empty. ~Fish and chips $12 served with coleslaw and tartar sauce. ~Buffalo chicken $10 served with a side of tater tots.  I was definitely not a fan of the fish and chips the fish wasn't even fried in a batter and the slaw tasted funny.The buffalo chicken however was delicious,it was an open face burger with lettuce,tomatoes & red onions.The chicken was tender and grilled to perfection also had some heat from the buffalo sauce.  I would say go if you're a fan of dive bars,watch a game or play some pool just not for the food.  Cheers!",

We had breakfast steak and eggs. The rib-eye was fantastic and the eggs were cooked as ordered. The potatoes were pretty sad though - sorry Duke's. They tasted like they had been sitting in a pot for quite some time. Drinks were cold and like I said, the set-up was really good. They even covered the pool tables to make extra seating for fans.

Their food menu is huge too, something for everyone. Great appetizers/finger food, awesome sandwiched and 30 different salad for the healthy minded. The Reuben and Ahi tuna salad are a few of my faves.   The bar backs up to the golf course so you have a great view while sitting on the back patio. Like I said there is something to entice anyone.

This ended up being a lot of shots and definitely some over consumption for some customers. When Cardinals fans became rowdy they didn't blink an eye but if another fan became rowdy they took swift action. I heard them tell non-Cardinal fans that they shouldn't have came to a Cardinals bar when they complained about the aggression of some of the customers. Eventually I was able to meet a very aggressive drunk who was trying to kick some customers out. I was in disbelief but laughed out loud when I realized this drunk was the owner. If you are a Cardinals fan this is a place to get belligerently drunk with the rude staff and drunken owner.",

Once I got upset and just came to the bar it was better until the short thicker brunette girl was whispering telling the bar tender it's her table. I would deff consider looking into re hiring some people. Maybe get some people that care, or have bills to pay. The curly haired kid with a shaved sides trash. Tel him to quit flirting and be there for people who wanna spend money and they tried putting extra beers on our tab. Get it together. Felt like I was imposing to spend money there",

Nothing spectacular about it, just a bit cheapy. The karaoke host was really entertaining but had troubles controlling a packed Dukes bar.  The second time we went with friends for dinner and drinks. This is when I realized this place has a ton of tvs, and was constantly packed.. Our waited was young he was a tad bit horrible. Forgot food orders, forgot to out in food, misordered food. He did buy is a shot at the end of our night so we let most of it slide, but we were almost to the point of asking for a manager. The food was pretty decent and id say 5/10, I few items came out cold.   Id go back to this place for drinks but id roll somewhere else for chow.",

I walk in, take a seat at a high top in the bar area.  3 or 4 waitstaff walks right past and never acknowledges my existence. Tonight I must have been partially stealth like. A woman was walking at the same time I did. I held the door for her. She thanked me. She sat down at a high top in the bar right next to me. She was presented a menu. Ordered a drink, was served her drink and I had yet to be acknowledged.  I waited about 5 more mins and left without a single word uttered.  This is the 2nd time this has happened.    I guess I will try again in 2020.  Maybe my Casper effect will have worn off by then.",

My girl and i came in after a rough day and felt 2,000x better after we left thanks to the the kind words Felicia had for us. She was so incredibly thoughtful, attentive, kind and gave my friend the best advice to get her through this rough patch. We asked for her schedule so we could come back and see her. Exactly one week later we came in and asked for her section and she greeted us with hugs and noticed how my friend's spirits had lifted since the week before. She's incredibly genuine and we will be back to sit on her section only! Ps get the southwest salad, it is AMAZING ! Thank you Felicia for being the best part of our week every week!  -Drea /Bri",

They were having a promotional offer for their 20th anniversary where they were offering a free mimosa with every purchase of food. We didn't see this offer, but we ordered food and drinks anyway. We played disc golf then went to leave but saw their sign offering the mimosas. So we went inside and told them we were just here for food but didn't get the mimosa and because the receipt showed we paid the bill after 4pm they wouldn't honor their promotion per Rebecca the manager.  The funny party is, we ordered other drinks again and only asked for one mimosa. Seems to me a $4 mimosa would be worth a few loyal customers.",

Got in early enough to grab a seat on the couch that made our experenice that much better. Our server(s) were as prompt as they could be seeing it was very busy.   The crowd was upbeat and fun and the atomsphere was great.  We will be back for Weeks 3-17, since I'll be at the game next Sunday here.  Go Lions!!!",

It's a Friday night and they are busy but first thing the guys tried to order bud light draft and they don't have any then they don't have bud draft .  The guys finally decided on a different beer and they stirred the best with a straw to make it look fresher. As we are placing our order we are warned they are busy and it will be about 30 minutes to get food. We decided to stay instead of starting over somewhere else.  30 minutes later my husband and I get our food, 15 minutes later 2 of our friends get their food then another 15 minutes or other friends for their food. One of my friends fries were ice cold another ones order was completely wrong. The other 2 said their food wasn't  worth the wait. We complained to a bartender and they chewed out waitress out and none of it was her fault. They had our waitress in tears. While waiting we also saw 4 servers did in the trash for something and go straight to getting people's food without even washing their hands. Finally we had to be THOSE people and get a manger and they discounted or meals but that was not the point. They need better people in the kitchen better hygiene and better stocking of popular beer.",

So we walked in and politely asked these 2 scummy 20-somethings if someone was sitting on the table between them and the big screen showing the bball game (which also overlooked the temporary kiddie play area with about 8  6 year olds having a birthday party - egad)   One of them said \"yea, they're free, if you don't block my view\". I glared at him with my best  \"as if...\" look (he was puny). So we sat down, I looked at the kids, then my wife, and we both said 'let's go back to Majerles\", so we left.   I just don't like the layout of the place, it's got awkward and uncomfortable seating, and the absolutely worst thing about this dump ?   Kids-in-the-bar. Yes, there are kids in the big section off to the right.  I don't go to a bar that allows kids (Zipps in N.

The past few years we have been fortunate enough to see the game at home on Root Sports or Altitude.  This is one of the weeks the game was on neither. So off to Dukes we trekked from Glendale. First of all when the game is on at noon you should not be waiting till noon to find your satellite feed. As  we have gone  sporadically in the past 5 years this has become the norm. Wait till noon to find the game. Spend the entire 1st quarter trying to find the game. Someone finally hooks their computer up and we see 30 seconds of game and 10 minutes of buffering.  Don't plan on watching the game if you are expecting to. The owner should be offering a discount to all who sat there that ordered food and drinks. Not my idea of watching a game at a sports bar. I will say the food and drinks were great as usual.  Believe me I have eaten there more than once without being able to see the game. I also see you have removed all the booths and put in foosball tables leaving  even less seating. Might I suggest moving your pool tables into that same room and putting all those tables into the middle room which is much lighter and would provide more seating . Also you might want to think about upgrading your satellite if you are going to consider yourself a site for Montana football.",

    "text": "Great spot, friendly staff, good food and drinks with a ton of TVs, pool tables, darts, fooze, buck hunter etc.  Reasonable prices and open floor plan.  Great friendly atmosphere and like the other reviews report its not a \"Scottsdale scene\", this is where you and your friends go for a beer, to watch a game, shoot some pool (or fireball shots..maybe both), or stop in midway through a disc golf game.  Patio is dog friendly so weekends its a great place to walk and enjoy a beer with other dog lovers.  This is a great spot for a casual night with friends, trivia on wed and Fridays is better then most places trivia (actually challenging general knowledge not just filled with crap pop culture questions, its actually good for all ages). One of the few True sports bars on the east side of town.  The owner AL is there most times and takes great pride in his bar and sponsors allot of local teams and charity events!    Food Review (Updated 1/22/16): Well when I had written the original review they had just redone the whole menu and everything was fresh way above expectations for a while.  Although I still go there all the time and love this place I felt I need to update the food part as it was not accurate any more.  The food is still way better but has slipped back to above average bar food, and in the Scottsdale market with gastro pubs and sports bars everywhere if your just going for a great food experience there are allot of choices specialize in food. If you want a great neighborhood sports bar with good food and tons of TVs this is your place.  Quesadilla, Egg McDuke Burger, Chicken Tenders, are still my favorites.  FAMILY?: During normal lunch and dinner hours it is fine for a family but if you take your kids to watch a football game at a bar on Sundays maybe you should read some more parenting books and not be mad that its a BAR environment (a few of other reviews complain about not kid friendly during football, personally i hope they don't come back as they really mess up my football experience giving me dirty looks when I curse the Damn Packers... its a sports bar people).       FOOTBALL:  DA BEARS!!!! Unlike zips and other venues in Scottsdale you can actually watch all the games at once there is a wall of tvs not just scattered tvs.  Get there at least 30 min before your game on Sundays as it fills up and you need to snag a table or grab one from people leaving from prior game.  It is a go to football spot for most people in a 5 mile radius.",

    "text": "Location always plays a role in how a place is perceived, but I think that's particularly True for Dukes. This is about the closest bar to my parents house in south Scottsdale, so I've started coming here more and more when I come to visit. It's located in a random strip mall in a fairly residential area so it's not a place that people are gonna necessarily seek out. That being said, I think if Dukes were located someplace differently (even if it were still in a strip mall) it might be thought of a LITTLE more highly.  I mean, it's big. There's a TON of TV's (they even have them in the bathrooms). The drinks are cheap (especially the happy hour specials, which I believe actually run pretty late). The have pool tables, darts, and I think even a few arcade games. There's a patio. In my experiences, it's clean for the most part. They have a LARGE food menu. To be honest, I've only tasted things here and there when others have ordered stuff, and although it's not great, it's not bad, and like the drinks the food is affordable (I believe they offer a different deal each day). They also offer some sort free car service for those who can't drive home (I believe within 5 miles). The friend I usually come here with lives within walking distance, but we've taken advantage of it before. And like I said, the strip mall where's Dukes is located is in a highly residential area so I'm sure there's a lot of people who can take advantage of this service.  The only complaint I have about Dukes is I have encountered more than one bitchy/slow server. I've never been here when it's that crowded though, so it's generally not been a big deal (might be a different story when this place is packed).",

All the food is good bar food that's not expensive.  Great beer specials nightly and a hilarious crowd of people.  Go in and grab a seat at the bar, you'll see old drunkards, young idiot frat kids......I guess that's pretty much it, but it's still fun.  Go on Thursday for Karaoke, there are these two creepy old guys that sit seperately from one another, and just pass off the mic each song between the two of them.  It is the most awkwardly entertaining thing you will ever see.  Also, Saturday and Sunday morning bloody mary bar that you can't beat.",

This was our first visit to Duke's on McDowell Road, which is pretty close to our home. Great location for a sports bar and a cool place to watch sports on a hot summer day in Scottsdale.   We went to Duke's to watch Game 7 of the NHL Western Conference playoffs, and the owner refused to put it on in the main part of the bar, despite multiple customers' requests.  He told hockey fans to go to the pool (billiards) room to watch the game. No one went.  As we were leaving, my husband told the owner that we would have stayed longer if we could have heard the game. \"What do you want to hear, the puck going into the net?\" he says, laughing at us. And he tells us, \"See ya later,\" telling us if we don't like it we can leave. Who does that??  We weren't asking him to turn off the Dodgers game. We wanted him to turn off the sound for baseball and turn ON the sound for hockey.    We'll never go back to Duke's. Scottsdale has many other, better choices.",

Now, Dukes is a great place to settle in for a Cardinals game because they an official Cardinals headquarters. Not to mention you get a free shot after a Cardinals touchdown if you are wearing gear with the logo on it!   They are also an ASU bar, but let's not get into that. You won't find me there for those games....beardown! They have so many TV's of all shapes and sizes around the bar so I'm sure you'll find a game or sport that you enjoy. Not to mention its a big place with multiple sitting areas, indoor and outdoor...and yes they have a couple tv's outside!  I haven't tried many things on their menu yet but I am a huge fan of their Honey Hot wings. They are delicious!! Last night I tried their Wednesday ribs special and the barbeque sauce is so yummy. Next time I'm ordering their chicken tenders buffalo style! On Sunday's they have a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar that goes till 4pm.   Last night I was also able to experience my very first Trivia Night! It was a lot of fun and the rules are pretty straight forward and simple, however, the questions are not as the night goes on! It was nice to get out on a week night to try something different. I think they have Trivia Night twice a week.   The staff is friendly, our server last night was awesome. It's a sport's bar, with bar food, and sport's bar decor, nothing fancy, nothing special, but it is a welcoming, have a good time kinda place.",

    "text": "Hello my fellow yelpers, please take the time to read this yelp because I'm going to expose the truth about the establishment..  I used to be a employee here at this establishment and I regret it. The food was terrible, the staff was rude and disrespectful(except a few) and the owner.. Don't get me started on how much of an a hole he was.   Now I'll start with the food, working at this establishment, the food took forever to cook.. I would ring in a simple salad and not get it for 20-30 mins.. Now it doesn't take that long to make a salad, the coordination and the communication was terrible.. As a server we would always have a pager on us when the food was done, and there were time food would sit in the window for a long period of time.. Because the cooks wouldn't page us.. Now that being said.. I would ask the cooks to remake my food.. But I guess reheating it in the microwave counts as a \"remake\". Now Dukes signature dish I would say would have to be the wings.. Now, I've eaten alot of chicken wings and this place they're disgusting.. All they do is deep fry them and then extremely sauce them and give them to the customer.. You can say it was more sauce than wings.. Which would incline to a terrible stomach ache the next day.. Another this is alot of the apps were already pre-made.. Other than the mozzarella sticks, everything else was store bought.. The hummus, the cheese, onions rings.. Everything. Do don't be fooled when they say it's all homemade.. Pfft yea, and pigs fly. Also don't go on a busy day either and order food because as I said ealier, you'll wait up to an hour just for your appetizer..  Now for the staff,  Let's start with the bartenders..   MEGAN- very welcoming, very nice and has a great personality.. If it wasn't for her I would of never stayed because she had a heart and that's what defines her.   MONICA- She was ok, I would ask her something and she would give me a straight answer.. Now when I requested a drink from her.. Yea it took awhile to get my drinks..but she's eh ok.   Monique- was there to work and Always gossip about everyone . I hated that about her.. She was always gossiping like a 12 year girl alway talking about someone If it was either a customer or even An employee..like it was some kind of reality TV show. I always came into work thinking it was high school again because I felt bullied.   Mark- oh mark.. This man was in a \"management\" position and was terrible at it.. He would always flirt with the girls, giving them free shots and would rather Stare at a pair of boobs than help his fellow Co workers out.. He was always an a hole to the other workers (other than the girls). As an example, I would ask him for a drink.. His response..no. Or yea hold on.. Then he'll \"playfully\" laugh and say, just kidding.. Like no you weren't.. I heard him talk rude to customers, I heard him make comments that were disrespectful.  So if you go to Dukes and see mark working.. I advise.. LEAVE! just turn around and leave   Now finally Rebecca (crow) she's like Megan, she was nice and very informative.. She always had answer to my questions..so I don't have any thing to say about her..   Now finally the wait staff.   Just a heads up, you walk in there, the majority of the waitstaff are either high, or extremly rude.. There are a couple female staff are just there to work.. Rude to thier tables and rude to their fellow employees.. Like honestly if you see an ad for this place.. DO NOT APPLY!!!!! Unless your a total B*tch or a stoner.. Because that's all what Al seems to hire.  Now to the owner- AL. Word of advice.. DO NOT GO TO THIS BAR WHEN THIS MAN IS THERE!!!! And you'll know it's him because he's either yelling at someone or the only drunk ass old man there at the bar. This man has terrible.. Terrible.. Terrible managing experience.. You get hired the first thing he says is.. Your my family and I treat you like family.. HA LIES. I've seen this man grabbed and PULLED one of the servers hand and yell at her because there was a napkin on the floor.. This man only has three computer systems and  he's yelled at people for not using the one in the area. He's yelled at people for not having drinks on the table when they just sat down..hes very judgemental...towards other people.. You walk into the bar wearing cowboy stuff prepared to be yelled At to leave.. Or even shoved out. Because this man will lay his hands on you, if he doesn't like you, he's even layed his hands on the waitstaff thinking it's ok to shove your finger into someone chest or to grab some girls arm and pull her away to yell at her because there is a napkin on the floor.. One of these days he's going to do that to the wrong person and he's going to lose that bar..",

Review Below:  Ive been to this bar a few times, every time I leave annoyed.  The bar is in a great location, and they have a dog friendly patio - last night I found out why it's so terrible.  While getting a drink my dog kindly walked over to the owner, he then began shouting at me and my dog.  He drunkenly ranted about how the dog 'looked' like it might take a poop, I asked if he hates dogs so much and looses his ability to control his voice to a paying customer, why he would even say dog are allowed.    This place finally makes sense; it's the worst bar around because the owner is an old angry drunkin' man.  I actually feel sorry for his wife, as she stood there in all of the glory that was his anger, ragging at an upstanding military veteran and paying customer, in what must be a failing bar.",

I've been there maybe 10 times and only once did we get decent service. If it's busy when you get there, expect to ask for your server, as they won't notice you for 30 minutes or more. Once, we had a group of 6, and the waitress finally came by and brought us fries. When we had eaten half the fries and she returned, she said \"who ordered these?\" We had all assumed one of us did or she brought them over as an apology for the wait. Wrong! She grabbed them and scolded us for eating another table's fries. The one time we received our food within a normal time frame and had a polite server, made a world of a difference. This won't prevent me from returning for a game and a bloody, but Id go there more if the service improved.",

I understand that the Montana Football game is their busiest day, but seriously. Plan ahead and work at full staff. This bar is huge inside and I'm sure it's packed. We opted to eat in the patio and every table is full. Good thing we packed some string cheese. Very disappointed in the service. We were here 2 weeks ago on Sunday after riding and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. May rethink this spot. Portillos sounds really good right now!!",

    "text": "This place actually has great potential to live up to its self-proclaimed title of \"Scottsdale's best bar'.  The biggest thing holding it back is the tyrannical ownership of Al McCarthy. With the same unapologetic arrogance of a drunk Donald Trump, he rules with an inebriated iron first, consistently using his bar to get loudly and aggressively drunk and assert his \"power\" over everyone around him. He has even been seen inciting violence on a plethora of occasions. Nobody's safe, people who have been loyal to the place for years will get screamed at and even barred from returning, just for being unlucky enough to be caught in alcoholic owners path at the wrong time.  He then proceeds to drive home every day in spite of his intoxication. A deceitful sign that Al displays in front of the bar is an 'A' food safety rating.  Hard to believe a food safety inspector could miss all the cockroaches in the kitchen, keep an eye out there's plenty that often roam there way out to the the bar as well.  Over a decade of corruption is the only explanation for this display of dishonesty. Just about everything else about the place is good, one star for Al and his refusal to allow his bar to be brought into the 21st century.",

For no other reason than there is always a space at the bar and thir wings are respectable. In my many visits (happy hour pitchers are a GREAT deal), we have tried many of the sandwiches, burgers, even fish and chips. Nothing super good or super bad. Standard bar fare. Lots of ASU students working there, lots of sports on the plethora of televisions. Can get really crazy during big games. Trivia Sat nights 8 pm. Also fun. Dog friendly patio and frisbee golf right outside. What more can you ask? Also fun is watching Duke's owner (I think his name is AL) command staff to keep the place to his standards.",

    "text": "Shuffleboard, pool, golf arcade game, foosball and dartboards make for a fun time at this place. They also have a HUGE interior bar with plenty of space for seating. We typically go during the day so it's slow. We've gone a few times at night and there was live music playing, which is awesome. Wednesday nights they do live trivia at 7:30pm and Karaoke on Thursday and Saturday nights.   If you aren't interested in singing or competing in anything.... theres a bunch of TVs so it's cool to go to watch sports games. They have really affordable food and specials everyday.  Here's the breakdown: MONDAY: is a burger, turkey burger or pork sandwich for 3.50 (+1.00 for fries) TUESDAY: is prime rib with salad and fries for 10.75 WEDNESDAY: is ribs served with coleslaw, fries or potato salad for 9.75. Or their healthier option of one of their salads they offer for 8.50 THURSDAY: is the same rib offer from Wednesday. FRIDAY: is the shrimp platter with fries and coleslaw for 8.95 Or Baja fish tacos for 8.95 that come with fries. SATURDAY: Jack Daniels marinated steak! With salad and baked potatoes for 10.75  Another great thing about this place is how accommodating they are if you have a large party, you can bring 50+ people without having to pay reservation fees and all that nonsense like a lot of restaurants/bars will do you in the scottsdale.   Also, I've never had to use it... since I live 10 minutes away walking distance, but they do free \"avoid a DUI\" drives home from here...thats super legit.   I will forever love this place!",

The steak portion was generous, and it was delicious and perfectly cooked.  All of the ingredients were fresh, and when I realized that the kitchen had left off the boiled egg, the bar tender quickly ran back to the kitchen and brought me the missing egg.

I like that they had a couple of books to look at and choose your songs from - sadly the last few times I went it was just luck of the draw whether they had the song you wanted to sing.

Small stuff that I really enjoy, is the fact that you can borrow a phone charger (you have to give up credit card for trade) and have it charge your phone while you do whatever you do. Small stuff that I find very cool.  Also they have this cool anti-drink&drive policy where they take you home if you are inebriated. I don;t know the details, but the fact that there is one is very cool. Very very cool   In the end, it's a like a divey sports bar. And that is OK.",

This place is huge and has a decent patio.  Table to video games in every room.  Nostalgic sports awards to basic sport memorabilia hangs along the ways with advertisement of alcohol.  Large TV screens here and there with random channels playing.    I just didn't get a good feel about this place.  Drinks seem pretty affordable here, but the food wasn't too impressive.  We ordered the burger with fries, artichoke dips and jalapeno poppers.  I didn't eat the burger, but the fries were stale.  Ever ate fries that were in the freezer too long and the left in frying oil that needed to be changed?  Yeah it tasted like that.  The artichoke dips seemed like it came out of a box.  It didn't have much taste and the only thing I ate was the tortilla chips.  Finally the poppers were probably the \"best\" of the night between the dishes.  Nice and creamy once you bit into it and crispy on the outside.    Overall, serve was good since we were the only large group of people in there.  If you live close by and need a drink I would recommend this place.  However, the immature crowd and poor karaoke music doesn't make we want to stay too long. - Enjoy!",

There are plenty of TVs through the bar so being able to see a game is always possible.   They have the main bar area, a dining area, 2 large group rooms which can be reserved for parties and work functions.  There are areas for pool, darts, and other fun games. They offer karaoke nights and team trivia nights.  They also have ample patio seating with both a smoking and nonsmoking sides. The patio overlooks part of the green belt and the Shelby disc golf course.  Dogs are welcome on the patio too.   The food isn't fine dinning quality but it is one of the best bar foods I've had (and I grew up touring sports bar with my pops so I have tried many)  They have a fabulous burger called the egg McDuke in once a fried egg is topping off your burger.  Probably my favorite dish.  Most of their appetizers and salads are phenomenal.   I am never disappointed by their drinks. The beer specials are always great tasting. Their shots are ridiculous in size and always potent.  The best feature about Dukes is their no DUI service.  This is a free cadillac chauffeured ride home so that you don't have to drive drunk. More places should offer such a service.",

The first time I went to watch the Panthers game.. since there are no Carolina bars in PHX. Our waitress was AMAZING! She was friendly and down to earth, and always went out of the way to make sure we were satisfied. The food during that visit was pretty sub-par- I got their strawberry walnut salad, and they offered me every kind of dressing ever except Balsamic Vinaigrette. I feel like that's a pretty basic dressing to have and I'm still confused as to why they have 3 fruit vinaigrettes but no balsamic- but I digress. My boyfriend got a burger medium-rare, and it came out well done. I will say, though, we ordered onion rings as an appetizer and they were SO DELICIOUS. I don't know what kind of crack they put in their breading but omg gimme dat!  The onion rings were actually what coerced me to go back a few days later- I couldn't stop thinking about them! This time I went with the BBQ chicken salad and it was better. On this visit, we met the  owners and they were both really great- we could tell that they truly cared about their business and their patrons. Definitely a plus.  My only other complaint about this bar is the lack of lighting. They have closed shutters over all of their windows. Yes, I understand this is the desert and it gets hot- but it would be nice to not feel so cramped in.",

The hot wings, burgers, sandwiches, and salads are all pretty good!  It is a sports bar so if you are wanting to do an intimate lunch or want to speak without having to raise your voice a bit. This would not be the place for you. If you are a sports junkie than this is the perfect place for you to come and relax and watch various sports on there 15+ televisions and have a cold beer.",

The steak is very tender and Duke's only use the best meat, plus they only use non transfat oil to cook all there food. Duke's kind of health councious on how they cook things. But eating a burger is still bad for you, but at less they are trying to keep it more natural.",

Got the chili - it is good but they put way too much cheese in it.  They should make the cheese an option.  Got a salad as a wrap.  It is ok, but the raw carrots in it add hard cruncy bits you hae to deal with.  Finally, the Guiness tasted strange.",

Their drunk driving thing is great too if you live within 6 miles and it's free.",

    "text": "Well Condor and The Duke go way back, but Sunday was the first time I went for \"Brunch\".  After vigorously exercising along the Scottsdale greenbelt with Scraps, the Wonder Dog (\"SWD\"), for over 10 minutes, we ascended to the patio at Dukes. While I recovered from the workout, Angie, the pet friendly waitress, attended to SWD with ice cold agua fria. The Breakfast Burrito with chorizo was the next undertaking and it was muy bueno. Although no sports were on that early (well the Indy 500 was on, but that is just driving and I can do that locally), the Patio at Dukes was the perfect place for an early morning for a Man and his  Dog.",

    "text": "I am not usually the \"sports bar\" type, so the first time I went to Duke's, it was because of a friend's recommendation for the food.  The daily specials are quite a steal and since we went on a Saturday, getting a decent ribeye for less than $9.00 seemed like the way to go.  We enjoyed the meal, had the patio to ourselves and it was a lovely day.  When we cashed out, the server gave us a birthday postcard to fill out, so we did.  Last week, my fiance received his, so we decided on going Saturday so he could have the ribeye.  This time, we sat inside because it was a bit cool outside.  A bit loud and way too much basketball, but hey it's a sports bar, right?  Again, the food was good, especially considering their really low prices.  My guys vodka tonic wasn't up to par, but all in all, we enjoyed the experience and will go again next month for my free birthday meal.",

It has lots of pool tables and dart boards, two huge patios that overlook the green belt and lots of TVs. My only complaint is the Karaoke they do on Thursday. It is horrible and ruins the whole vibe there. Oh, and they have the no DUI car that will drive you home for free...but don't forget to tip.",

The clientelle at this bar is very \"old school\" and mostly \"older\".  The nachos are really good and the CHILI CHEESE FRIES are quite good also.  They have kilt lifter on tap and a pretty good selection of other beers.   It's fun to look out onto Vista Del Camino Park at the passers by as you nibble on your food and sip your ice cold beer!!  Everytime I see Duke's I think of Fraiser's Dad from that TV show and he the name of HIS bar was also \"Duke's\"",

We're eating, drinking, watching the game, the crowd is into it, when mid way thru the 3rd quarter, a microphone comes on interferring with the NFL broadcast, announcing its time for TRIVIA!!!!   WTF!!!!  Its opening night of the NFL and you're holding a trivia night!!!!!  Unf***king believable!!  This is a \"SPORTS BAR\"?????  I mean...what can I say!!!  I'm so tired of \"sports bars\" playing karaoke, holding trivia night or playing music while the SPORTS are on.  We immediately closed our tab and left.  The most pathetic part was that the waitress advised if we moved to the back where the pool tables were, we would not be able to hear the trivia!  How 'bout you move the trivia back there and let the NFL fans watch the damn game!!!  Very, very sad.  Sports bar??? HA!!  What a joke!  BTW, my wife ordered the \"full\" order of ribs, expecting a full rack, but recieved what would be considered a \"half rack\" anywhere else.  On top of that, she said they were the worst ribs she ever had.  Just sayin'.",

I've recently returned and have to say it had to be the absolute worst crap bar dining experience ever. Hopefully they still have good football Sundays. Otherwise I'd venture to say with the speed the place has gone downhill they should not be around too much longer unless the owner(very rude, drunk?, old man) has deep pockets. Unfortunately south Scottsdale does not have many good choices for sports bars. Good thing I don't live up that way anymore.",
