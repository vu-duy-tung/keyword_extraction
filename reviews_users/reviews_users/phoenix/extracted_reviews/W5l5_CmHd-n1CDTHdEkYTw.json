I wish they gave you more than 1 pita though, make sure you order an extra (if not 2).  Thank you Pita Heaven",

Second visit I encouraged other employees to try the food. I called and asked if we could give them our order the day before so it would be ready before lunch crowd. No?. One of the rude girls there said no you have to call the day of the pick up? So we called in our orders all nine of them as soon as they opened. When we got there we had to stand in line with people who were placing orders-12 of them. Ok our food sat there for over 30 minutes that we knew of.  Friday evening at 7:55 I called and asked what time they closed and one of those girls told me 9:00pm.  I drove 12 miles back to the area. When I arrived at 8:45 pm, I assume the same girl I had spoken with earlier said we decided to close early tonight. Thats enough for me.  The owner needs to send his girls to charm school and they need to know customers aren't coming in because of them.",

Was debating between the hummus pita and the Chicago Gyro (thanks to other Yelpers photos and reviews). Went with the Chicago. Ordered to go, waited about 4 minutes, and the friendly cashier brought it over to me. It was loaded full of beef and lamb. I had requested they add hummus spread, which was divine. Overall, I prefer more veggies than meat, but the meat was tender and delish so I overlooked it. The tzatziki sauce was pretty good too.  Wish it would've come with lettuce or something else, but the onions and peppers were tasty.  Will be here again to try the hummus wrap next time. Prices were decent too for the amount of food you receive.",

Not much more I could ask for in meaty Greek ruffage!   Today, there was a mix up with my order. I paid for a gyro pita. Not only did the staff kindly correct my order with the salad without problem, or accept my offer to pay the $2 difference, (it's worth it), they packed the mistaken gyro pita up with me to take. Who does that nowawdays? My co-worker was thrilled to have the gifted pita and my salad was fantastic!",

Got here during the weekday lunch hour rush. They quickly took my order I requested to go. I ordered the chicken shawarma and upgraded to greek fries meal with pop.  The shawarma chicken meat was under-seasoned and seemed like it was warmed up in a microwave. There was one pickle and one tomato slice on the actual pita bread making it a less of a bland flavor. There were no other sauces or anything else making the flavors connect on the store bought soggy pita bread  that held everything together. I poured the tzatziki dip and sprinkled some feta from the fries onto my pita and that still did not help. As for the \"greek fries\" they tasted stale along with the feta cheese, like it may have sat in a fridge a month too long past the expiration date and absorbed some other smell that baking soda in the fridge could not absorb, the oil the fries were fried in may possibly have needed to be changed cuz they just weren't right Salt couldn't even fix this problem. Perhaps if I went to McD's down the street and brought those fries here I would've been somewhat okay with the whole $12 I paid for this whack of a pita hell meal.  I'm set with this place. No more chances.",

I received $5 off deal when order on Grubhub with the minimum of $10, so I asked my friend if she wanted to try new food and we were pretty happy about the deal.  When I got there to pick up the food, the manager lied to me about $5 already got deducted from the total.

The cucumber salad is dressed well with ample feta and tomatoes and these juicy pepperoncinis. Thank you Frank for making this delicious food. Also the dolma was the BEST I've ever had and the baklava is superp! I could eat this food everyday and for happy :)",

I really do love their pita bread and hummus as it taste fresh and homemade and their double fried French fries are always delicious!! They have redone their menu and it looks so much better then the previous moving menus that most people seem to complain about! The only complain I have about the place is the customer service, they are always in a hurry to get you to order quickly while you are deciding what to get and if they can, they could start greeting customers every now and then instead of have a blank stare in their faces, especially the cook who doesn't look like he wants to be there. But if you can handle that, this is a really great affordable place to eat gyros! The restaurant is always clean and comfortable to dine in.",

Super packed and fairly loud inside but we were served within 10mins! Crazy!!! I was surprised and thankful because we were hungry. I got the chicken shawarma on pita w/fries and he got the beef dip sandwhich w/fries. My chicken had a curry taste to it which I like but was a tiny (very tiny) bit dry. Large portion of meet. $10 for each meal and it comes with fries and a pop. Not bad for the portions at all. Fries were fresh and crispy. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and it wasn't as hectic. I would go here again! Staff was friendly too",

I've tried everything here in the last year and here's my report.  The beef is dry not juicy at all, I think it's a little overcooked.  The chicken is delicious.  The falafel is over breaded and over fried, still decent.  The humous is average at best. They have an Italian beef sandwich, it's probably the best thing they have, order it with extra au jus and extra peppers you'll love it. They would have gotten a 3 star rating but they have a major flaw, phone orders are never ready.  I've given them 5 opportunities to have my phone order ready, I show up, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes, or 15 minutes after I order and I show up and they start making it.  I order by phone because I'm in a rush, they make the excuse that they want me to have fresh food...well then why even take the order? Their take out style is terrible, eat out there, you won't enjoy take out.",

The pita bread was good, the lettuce and tomato were very fresh, the falafel was kinda bland, and the tzatziki had an unpleasant rotten after taste. There were allot of people eating gyros, so maybe that's the better bet?

Now it wasn't very good either. The chicken wasn't Kebob at all, they were two thin cutlets of breast meat. The seasoning was ok at best. The veggies were terrible, they included grilled baby carrots (lazy and nasty), the bell peppers tasted off (is that possible) and the broccoli and cauliflower tasted like they were frozen veggies.

It's one if those restaurants where you order at the front and they bring your meal to you. It took about 10 minutes to get my food. The salad was just okay. The chicken was very good - it was moist and had a slight Indian curry flavor to it. It also came with a delicious yogurt dill sauce. The downside was there was wayyy too much vinaigrette on the salad! The lettuce was drowning. Also the dressing was packed full of spices, which made it doubly intense.   While I was eating lunch around 1:30 pm, they decided to mop the floors with a very strong smelling cleaner, which made me a little sick to my stomach.   All that being said, I would go back to try a gyro since the chicken was so good.",

Lot's of meat and tzatziki sauce to satisfy most critics. The Chicken Pita is something on my \"need to try list\", but every time I come back here, somehow I end up ordering the Chicago Gyro again. The greek salads and french fries here are also good.  I'm disappointed to tell you that their Chicago dog is no longer on the menu (please update the website, guys!). This was another one of my favorites, and since there are not too many Chi-town places around, it makes it a little more difficult to satisfy that craving for a Chicago tradition.  What surprised me was their Italian Beef sandwich. The meat was flavorful, moist, came with giardiniera and some au jus on the side for dipping. I'm picky when it comes to food from my hometown, and not too many places can crank out a good italian beef sandwich. I would probably rank this one second behind Portillo's.  Service here is good, the staff is friendly. This is a great place to grab a quick lunch and some great food. They get busy at times, and the background music sometimes makes me feel like I'm somewhere in a foreign land - a nice escape from work! I will definitely be back!",

In the middle of the meal I looked around the restaurant and thought to myself, \"Everyone here must only be here because they don't know any better\". The staff was friendly, establishment was clean and well dressed, and the kitchen was quick, but the food was utterly disappointing, mediocre at best. I had the gyro with a side salad, and my friends had the chicken which they described as abominably bland. They did not finish their meals which was unusual for a group of 20 year old men. The pita bread was OK, the salad was OK, IMO they lack quality ingredients. You could quickly gather ingredients at a basic grocery store that would trump their pita and greens. The worst offender of the meal was their gyro meat which lacked rich herbs and spices, and had a rubbery, plastic, texture. I felt like it was diluted, not sure with what, but it did not have the dark brown coloring, consistent with all the wonderful, mouth watering, gyro meat I've had in my life. I'd be happy with this meal if I got it for half the price from a kiosk that sells pre-packaged, processed food. Go to Zorba's Greek cafe if you're looking for good Greek in this area.",

I come in almost every Sunday after Church like click work and order the same food the same way. Even if I call they know my order. For some reason the guy who made my food though it was ok to put the sauce I asked on my food instead of in the side which is how it always comes when I order it to go. The look that he gets on his face anytime he messes up an order is as if it is an inconvenience to him to make it right.  Smh. The little things like this keep me doing business again. Especially since it's happened more than three times.",

    "text": "Is this heaven?... no, it's Chandler.  This small counter-style restaurant in a strip mall is a solid choice for lunch.  I've had the gyro and the Greek salad here before, but today I stepped it up for the gyro platter.  It was outstanding.  For $9, I got food served to me on 3 different plates.  There was a generous portion of gyro meat, and french fries served with sliced tomatoes & onions and tzatziki.  Then, there was separate side greek salad and a pita.  That's a lot to review.  The gyro meat was about what you'd expect.  At least it looks legit because they cut it from one of those giant meat cylinders.  The french fries were fantastic, thick cut but crispy with a seasoning salt on them.  The tzatziki was thicky and lumpy, with a strong dill flavor (and I mean all of that as a compliment.  It was good stuff.)  The salad was crisp and fresh with an acidic Greek dressing and some feta cheese.  It was mostly lettuce, but there was tomato, onion, and a single olive & pepperoccini to make it a nice presentation.  And finally, the pita was grilled warm and toasty, as it should be at a place named Pita Heaven.  I ate my entire salad, and about half of the rest.  $9 is a little pricey for lunch, but not when you make two meals out of it.  There is a large menu, but I've never strayed from the Mediterranean choices.  If you like Chicago hot dogs or beef sandwiches, they've got you covered.  If you're on a health kick, the Greek salad with chicken is a healthy, but satisfying option.",

Really made us feel like we were home in Chicago when we were asked if we wanted to add fries and 'pop'! Love the old school gyro meat roasting on the spit too!   My mom ordered the classic gyro and I had the chicken salad. As soon as the food was brought to the table, I knew I should've ordered a gyro. It looked so damn good!  The marinated chicken was to die for - just needed a little more seasoning in the salad dressing. But who am I to complain, I ate the whole plate!   We were skeptical of the tzatziki sauce was made with dill. We're not fans of tzatziki with dill. To my surprise, it was very light on the dill and could barely taste it.  It was actually very tasty!  Need to let all my Chicagoland friends know to visit this place - it's a slice of home in the Valley of the Sun! So good, we're going back tonight for dinner!",

It is an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks putting your food together and there is much steel used throughout - has a modern feel.  The only thing I'll knock if for is having a TV hanging on the wall.  Why do all restaurants feel like they MUST have a TV?  The food This is why you're here - the food.  My wife and I shared a chicken shawarma pita + fries and a falafel salad.  The salad had six generous falafel on a bed of romaine lettuce, feta cheese, tomato, onion, and a tangy lemon vinaigrette.  The falafel were well spiced and came alive when dabbed with the tahini? sauce that came with it.  The pita had many of the same ingredients as the salad, romaine lettuce, onion, tomato, and to top it off well seasoned chicken and a tzatziki that was dill-icious.  The crinkle cut fries were a good balance of crisp and fluffy.  It's hard to mess up fried potatoes.  The bottom line The lunch \"specials\" are really only a few cents off the regular prices, but for under $10 you walk away feeling like you've eaten real-whole-food, not some over processed junk from a tube.  I highly recommend the items that we sampled and I'm sure I'll be back to try the gyros.",

The gyro portions were amazing...I really felt like I got a great value for the $9.95 salad. The tzatziki was awesome too. They have unsweetened tropical iced tea which is awesome too. I got baklava which I'm going to eat at home but the portion is big especially if you compare it to Halal Guys. Overall, I highly recommend this place!",

Kinda pricey,  however, I went out side to chat,  and I threw away my cup,  I was prepared to buy a new drink but he didn't charge me when he probably should have. That was nice.  The only thing that bothered me and I have a sore spot for crap like this,  tipping. When you pay,  he gives you a reciept to sign like a normal restaurant,  with a tip line.  They didn't serve me.  They didn't come to my table to take my order.  It's just fast food. No tip. Especially if I'm doing the work.  So,  my suggestion is bring cash,  cause it's awkward not tipping when it's right in front of them. I felt uncomfortable and kinda don't wanna go back.  Other than that.  Ok place.",

Sigh. 1st visit )  Service: I asked them to separate the sides from the meat.  They told me it has to come in one to go box.  Confused I tried explaining again, I wanted to order two different combos but out the sides together in containers.  No go....?!  So she had me order each item from the combo ala carte so they could be separated in the to go containers. Food: unimpressed. Nothing special. No wow this is so good. Don't get me wrong, I love Mediterranean, and this is near my house, to it warranted another go. 2nd visit)  Service: Stopped in with shopping bags and wanted a quick chicken gyro.  You would have thought I was disturbing them by asking to buy my dinner to go.  Because it was quick and frankly because last visit wasn't tasty and strange service I didn't tip on the chicken gyro.  Oh boy, stare down and comfort level dropped.  All I wanted was a chicken gyro, why is this place so strange.   Food: two stars because the tzatziki was good. However not in the sandwich. The actual chicken gyro? Well nothing special and the pita, fair.   Sadly, although close to my house, I'll pass on this spot due to two rounds of 'less than' in both service and food.  I want to feel welcome to an establishment and experience good tasting food.",

Their ingredients are always fresh, especially their pita, and even the salads, which can be an issue at other places.

As you can see in the pics, the salad is loaded with gyro meat. There is a plethora of veggies and the dressing is ever so yummy. They also give you a side of taziki sauce, and who doesn't love that with gyro meat!?! Due to the amount of meat and veggies, I should eat this salad in two sittings, but I always devour it in one.   Friends of mine also have great things to say about this place. Please check it out. Also, right now they are offering 10% off with a Yelp check in.",

It was entirely meat, tomatoes and onions, which I was told is what makes it \"Chicago style.\"  The pitas were very light and fluffy.  The meat was also very tasty, genuine gyro sausage, not the Steakums everyone tries to pass off nowadays in their gyro simulations.   The baklava was very good, well spiced and not cloyingly sweet.  The decor was also nice, well decorated with original art on the walls, ad the prices were reasonable.  But my wife's chicken pita was just OK, and the hummus was pretty sad, it tasted store-bought and we did not even finish it.  Overall a good choice, but I think you have to pick and choose around the menu.",

What a hidden little gem, never judge a book by its neighbor cover  or reputation, that's what I did. Big mistake. This place probably has the BEST local eats/ food out of this ENTIRE SHOPPING center.  Delish schwarma, tziki and tahini sauce. Owned by locals and a nice, clean, and tasty menu. I'll surely be back every week to try new dishes. The staff were nice and everything I ate was fresh tasting and pretty in colors. They are VERY quick. I would've taken a pic of my food but it was so good I ate it in less than ten minutesm you're stuck w fries. Sorry not sorry.",

The hummus had 0 flavor and was watered down along with the tahini. I've eaten at so many authentic places, this one is the equivalent of American \"Mediterranean\" food.

I have had the chance to speak with the manager, and he is a very cool guy. He is also a vegetarian, and said that he is looking to expand the Vegetarian menu soon. There are nice paintings on the walls, and the is a TV in case you plan on eating in. You can call ahead an take you food to go, and everyone I made eye contact with smiled back at me. Things still seem a little new, which makes sense since they just opened; the lady at the register seemed flustered when I asked her about the falafel, but I'm sure that once they all get settled in, this place will be 5 star worthy:-)",

I'm not very familiar with Greek food, but  we were looking for a quick lunch and at least the opportunity to make a healthy choice for lunch, and Pita Heaven seemed to fit the bill.  I ordered a chicken pita, added feta, and a side salad instead of fries. The pita was HUGE, the chicken well seasoned, and the feta added just the right kick. My friend had the pork loin souvlaki pita and it was very tasty as well. The tzatziki sauce was mild and creamy, though i would probably ask for it (and the salad dressing) on the side next time so i could control the amount that i use.  My meal was $10.00, more than what you would spend at In and Out across the parking lot, but I'm more than willing to spend the couple extra bucks at a local restaurant  that offers me a healthier alternative to typical fast food.",

    "text": "A few day's ago, I  stopped into Pita Heaven for some lunch with a couple of friends. This little spot gets packed really quickly during the lunch hour so I suggest coming in a little early.  We decided to try the vine leaves first and they did not disappoint.  I choose to have the the gyro pita and salad. The gyro meat was simply the most flavorful I have had! A fresh made pita (they make their own in a very cool looking machine) enclosed a generous portion of meat that spilled out from the bread. The bread was soft, warm and spongy, the meat was absolutely delicious.My salad on the other hand was very bland and not very greek. There wasn't enough feta cheese, the dressing was not lemony enough and the tomatoes were unripe and unflavorful, and one olive does not do it in a greek salad! Jose tried the kebaab. It is cooked fresh and they warn you that it does take about 15 minutes to prepare. Well worth the wait! I couldn't resist sampling a few morsels and it was very flavorful. The were beautifully grilled on the outside and still moist on the inside. The presentation was beautiful and they were served with a side of yellow rice. Phil decided to try one of the Chicago offerings, Phil doesn't like trying new foods and was quite apprehensive, finally deciding on the Italian beef sandwich. To our relief he loved it!  He was so pleased he even expressed his pleasure to the staff preparing it.  Our only complaint would be one of the staff members who seemed rather unfriendly, but overall Pita Heaven was a great experience.",

It reminded me of the first gyro I ever had in North Chicago almost 40 years ago.  The ambiance is comfortable and today the young lady behind the counter was very friendly and efficient.  The food came hot and quick and was all tasty.  Very extensive menu, a good choice for a lunch or dinner.",

There was NO feta or lettuce put on Gyro which was a surprise. It was an average Gyro and nothing special. Pita Heaven it is not just needs to be a bit more friendly and include feta and lettuce on Gyros. Homemade Baklava would certainly help. I  had a Very Dry Baklava which was definitely not homemade or tasty. If the Greek Grill on Chandler is closed, it would be the only reason i would go back. Very average but i guess ok.",
