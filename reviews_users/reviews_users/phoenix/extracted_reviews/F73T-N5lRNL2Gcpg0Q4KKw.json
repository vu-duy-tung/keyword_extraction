I'm shocked, because I have raved about this place to other people and recommended it for when they visit Scottsdale. It was my favorite place I came to the last time I was in town. The servers are all really knowledgeable. But I have to say, I was in there recently and found a hair in my food. All they did was take the one dish off the menu and not charge me for it. I thought this was extremely poor hospitality and I've never seen anything like this in my life. Like if you guys have a failure with your hygiene in the kitchen, you make up for it. Bottom line, amazing food, not so great ethics.",

The ricotta appetizer was delicious and such a fun, different then normal app to try. The green tortellini was seriously so good, it was a little sweet but also had an interesting spice on it, loved it! For my main course I had the chicken that came with flat bread/ tortilla, onions, lemon caper sauce and surprisingly my favorite was the hot sauce (not even sure if that's the right word for it because it thankfully wasn't super spicy but had a lot of excellent flavor).   Dessert was the olive cake which was only enough for one which was great because I didn't have to share!  Zach our server took great care of us too! We will be back!",

    "text": "Fat Ox is an upscale restaurant that serves modern Italian Food. The atmosphere is energetic and very loud. The lighting is very dim...for me...too dark. I didn't actually see my food until I looked at my photos I took. Most of the time I had no idea what I was putting in my mouth. Sometimes it turned out to be a good thing and with my dinner it WASN'T a good thing. You will read about THAT latter.  This restaurant offers many small plates of starters and interesting hand made pastas. Our server recommended that we order a starter, THREE pastas (because they are small tastings) and dinners.   I have to say the Charred Taleggio was very good. I couldn't see the pomegranate  seeds on it but I felt them pop in my mouth. This dish was balanced, interesting and tasted great.  The Casoncelli Butternut Squash Stuffed Pasta was AMAZING and by far my favorite dish of the evening. It was a very small portion. It was like eating just three stuffed rigatonis but the Casoncelli was so full of great flavors and texture. The pasta was so perfect I could have eaten this whole plate myself.  At this point I was very pleased with the food I was served and thought this could still be a five star experience.  My expectations were very high and I only ordered the Chicken because I've been to the Chef's other restaurant Zinc Bistro and was served maybe the very BEST CHICKEN in Metro Phoenix there so I was expecting something that compared.  Our dinners arrive and take my first taste. I note again it's very dark and hard to see what I'm digging into. I got some chicken with Rubbery Soft Chicken Skin Covered in a Tangy but tasty sauce. I have to be honest and I tell it like it is. IT WAS LIKE PLAYING MURDER IN THE DARK WITH THE CHICKEN. For me it was too difficult to navigate threw the rubbery skin and bones in the dark. I accidentally swallowed a pile of fennel I had no idea was there. I didn't even know until I looked at the photos I took that my plate had radishes on it.  My husband had the Skirt Steak. I tried a piece and to be honest I don't remember what it tasted like. It wasn't very memorable. My husband complained to me that the food wasn't hot and was only warm. He said his favorite part of his plate was the green part of the roasted carrot. He said the carrot top was the tastiest part.  My waitress seemed nice and tried to be very helpful but neglected to tell me that my plate came with polenta. I didn't think my meal came with anything but charcoal red peppers that the menu states. (P.S. Chicken was NOT over charcoal red peppers,((opening hiccup or menu typo)) So I ordered an extra side that I wouldn't have ordered. Not a big deal but it is the truth.  Maybe because I couldn't see the polenta it didn't taste like polenta to me. Or maybe it contained too many add ins. I don't know. It was tasty and good but the base of it tasted more like farina and not corn.  The Calabrian Roasted Cauliflower might have been missing the Calabrian Chili unless it was powdered but was ok.   In short I thought the pre-dinner courses of Charred Taleggio and the pasta dish of Casoncelli was excellent. Dinners weren't bad but didn't compare to the previous dishes. Service was good. Atmosphere would be better if it wasn't so loud or so dark. They have interesting lighting fixtures all over the restaurant and the decor is eye pleasing.  I note that at the time of this review (12-4-16) this is a newly opened restaurant and they may be still be in the growing stage figuring things out.",

When we arrived we were seated right away but wasn't greater by anyone after we sat. We waited for waters before we started to look at the menu...those didn't come. So we finally looked and after deciding on our drinks, apps, and entrees after having some questions. We still had not received any waters or greetings to let us know they would be right with us. We looked around for a waiter and was not given any attention. So we left...very disappointed.",

    "text": "I would give Fat Ox 2.5 stars if I could. I had reservations with my fiance at 7:45 yesterday. We were seated at a high top table in the bar area; it was not really ideal but better than nothing at all. It took some time for our waitress to come over. She was very nice and personable but I feel like the bar area was understaffed. Another couple close to us waited 15 minutes just to get their tab. We even had to get our own waters refilled at the bar during our dinner because our waitress was no where to be seen. We ordered the meat and cheese board, lamb Verde pasta, rib eye, side of mushrooms, and tiramisu. The food was better than average. It was weird though because on the menu there is no indication the rib eye comes with their polenta side automatically. It came to our table and we were both confused. I had to taste it to realize it was polenta. It would have been nice to know in advance because I have dietary restrictions and would have liked to switch mine out for another vegetable even if it cost me. Overall it was a good one and done experience. When Chick Fil A has better service than this restaurant, it doesn't make me want to return.",

The waiters were very nice but a bit slow, and the food came out a little cold- I think (and hope) mostly due to a large party seated near us. However, they recognized the lapse in service and gave us two desserts on the house. All in all, Fat Ox is a great space for dinner (as long as you don't mind the loud noise on a busy night), and the experience was pleasurable!",

    "text": "Let me start off saying the decor of this place is very beautiful and modern. I was really excited to try this restaurant. The menu is very long and the waiter explained that most of the dishes were small plates. We wanted to try a good variety. I felt like everything needed to be explained and it was exhausting. Everyone around us were saying they were friends of the chef so they got a \"special\" menu.  We started with..  -Calabrian Cauilfower- This was okay, had tons of olive oil on it. -Bellwether Farms Ricotta-The ricotta tasted extra sweet on the bread.  Next we wanted to try a few different pastas. I am a big fan of fresh made pastas.  -Agnolotti- This one was various ground up types of salami type meats, with a chicken broth poured on top. It was okay, very small. -Strozzapreti- This is one of the only pastas they don't make in house. It was okay. It was a very simple dish.  -Casoncelli-This dish looks beautiful but is extremely sweet. Its like eating a pie. I'm glad it was small because anymore would be too much.   I hate to say it but the pasta didn't change my life. I am willing to pay for fresh pastas but this just didn't do it for me.   The bread and butter on the plate was pretty and simple. It had good flavor.  I had the 7oz Creekstone Filetto. This was the best part of the whole meal, the filet was cooked nicely. The cheese potatoes were like a little too rich, but good.   This would be a good place to get a glass of wine and dress up, but not much more. I feel like a lot of the dishes were overrated and underwhelming. The menu will be expensive to pay for the rent at Scottsdale and Lincoln. Nothing I ate makes me want to come back. Loved the decor. That is all.",

    "text": "Food tasted pretty good, not going to front on that, but the portions were tiny and, all in all, the negatives greatly outweighed the positives at this establishment. For starters, my girlfriend had to wait 20 minutes for her glass of wine she ordered the SECOND we got there, absurd. We had a party of 6, most people had cocktails, not all, and we ordered a few appetizers. Once again, flavors were very good, but portions were extremely skimpy. Our entrees came out and they seemed very rushed, as if they wanted to flip our table and get another party in there ASAP. We had the gamut, from pasta, to swordfish, to short ribs, to scallops, and osso bucco. Swordfish, short ribs, and scallop portions were laughable, AND the swordfish was over cooked. Not okay at a restaurant of this \"caliber\". Anyways, the desserts were just okay and literally no one left the establishment wowed. After spending $700 we were all disappointed. We have eaten at some of the finest restaurants throughout the US and do not have any qualms about paying that for a fine dining experience, BUT we expect better quality, better portions, and better service when paying these prices for our meal.  Not trying to be rude at all, I am just giving my two cents. Most of the food had great flavor but lacked greatly in other areas. My recommendation would be to go to Capital Grille, Mastros, or even Buck and Rider before dropping way too much money for way too little at this place.",

Both were perfectly cooked al dente and the sauce was amazing. The gigli had a fresh san marzano tomato sauce with a flavorful pesto and the linguine had a pork sugo which was to die for! Our mains were very nice too, we had a medium rare skirt steak and grilled swordfish. We went with our servers recommendations for dessert and had the tiramisu and pistachio gelato with toasted crumble, both delicious. Service was wonderful, the staff was on-point at every moment.

The hostesses were not welcoming or simply kind! Which is not the way to treat anyone. We asked if there was an open table in the bar and all 3 of the ladies at the hostess stand Pointed to a corner table. It must have been too far for them to show us the table. It took an uncomfortably long time just to get water. The waitress finally showed up and her demeanor was not pleasant, a smile would have gone a long way. We were planning on eating but it was obvious that we were not welcome. We did order a round of wine which was good. To bad that the service was not at a higher standard. The area has far too many choices of eating establishment to waste money on restaurants that aren't trying to make patrons welcome. Being kind, welcoming, & friendly cost nothing, but your business!",

My dish had about 12 noodles on it. Save your money go somewhere else.  We went to In and Out fast food afterwards since we were hungry after our $150 meal. Save yourself..",

We eat out often and were eager to experience Fat Ox, as we love their sister place, The Mission.  I must say, it has been a quick expansion for this restaurant team; servers are not trained as well as before, chefs don't always get it right as they once did, even at our beloved Mission.  Having said all that, my salmon dish was good, nothing special. My husband's pork offering was a large serving, but not memorable. Our guest liked his scallops, and his wife said her salmon was good. The broccoli rabbe was too salty to eat, the waiter had few social skills, and did not apologize for the broccoli or another wrong order. The gelato was excellent.  The old Quilted Bear has been enlarged and modernized, so the space is open and appealing.  After discussing our food experience as we drove home, we agreed it wasn't a place to which we'd return. There are just too many really superb places to dine. We will try a new one, or happily return to our old favorites.",

    "text": "My rating of this restaurant is a 4.0 for the taste of the food, a 4.0 for ambience, but a 2 for portion size, price, disjointed menu/courses, and misleading information on service (described below).  My husband and I went with another couple and we ended up sharing the food (apps and main course) at the recommendation of the server.  First they brought delicious bread bites to the table. We ordered the burrata app and 3 pastas (the Garganelli was def the best) which we ordered first. Since we ordered 4 dishes, we all decided we would wait to see how we felt before deciding on our entres; plus, we wanted to take it slow and not be rushed. Prior to bringing our apps/pasta, the servers came to our table several times asking us what we wanted to order for our entres.  Although we told them we wanted to wait, one of the servers told us if we didn't put our orders in at that point, we would have to wait about 1 1/2 hours for the entres to come.  Although we still wanted to wait, he pressured us and we decided we would order. The server recommended we order the 18 ounce porterhouse to split in addition to another entre since we were all interested in some steak. Instead, we ordered the 18 ounce rib eye and the 7 ounce fillet thinking that would be plenty in light of all of the food we had already ordered.  Within 5 minutes of putting in our entre order, they brought the apps/pasta.  The apps/pasta were excellent but the portion sizes were very small, especially for the price. We each got about 2 tablespoons of each dish and finished them quickly; within 20 minutes our entres came, despite being told we would have a 1 1/2 hour wait if we chose to order the entres after we finished the apps/pasta.  The two steaks were plain with no sides and didn't take long to finish. When we did finish, the men were still hungry but because they felt somewhat misled, we decided to leave. The check, which includes a total of 5 alcoholic beverages, came to $300.00. Although we had a fun time together and the food was good, when all was considered, we agreed afterwards that we probably would not return.  Several other Italian places with really good food and less expensive.",

Tamara, the events coordinator, made sure we had a very special table that was intimate.  AJ, our server, went over the top on making sure we were taken care of in every way.  We started with Prosecco and the mozzarella di bufala with charred radichio.  It took us back to Treviso in Italy.  My husband got Rosso crest di gallo (cock's comb pasta) with duck.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavor was wonderfully rich. I got the cosoncelli pasta.  Beautiful little pasta purses filled with butternut squash.  It could of used a little sauce or butter but if you want to have a pasta primi and a meat secondi, this is the way to go without filling up extremewise.  My husband then had the 25 oz bistecca fiorentina (Italian steak).  The sear on the steak took us back to eating with Dario Cecchini in Panzano Chianti.  I ordered the short rib alla vacinara.  Some of the most tender fall off the bone meat ever.  All of this went so well with the wonderful Italian wines they have on the wine list.  One of the most wonderful surprises were all the amazing vegetable side dishes they kept bringing to the table free of charge.  I could have just eaten the vegetables.  For the desert they provided us with tiramisu but I just had to have the pistachio gelato also.  We were there for at least three hours, just like we would dine in Italy.  Matt Carter, Brian Raab and Mark Drinkwater have done it again!",

Also the tables are just TOO close together. We couldn't have a quiet 'private' conversation due to the extremely close proximity of our 4 dining neighbors (who were also quite loud). Food was really great - nice portions and very well presented. Our waitress & waitress-in-training was lovely - cant remember her name but they were both very attentive. Table-side caesar salad was very nice, but not enough - was a little small on the serve. Could have definitely had a larger serve because it tasted great! Wine list is very good, has a little too much US wine (which is fine, but if you want an international wine listen, don't be afraid to thin the herd a little) but a good Italian range also, limited wines from other great wine countries (2 from Australia only that I counted). After chatting with our waitress, she told us about the happy hour and taster options which sounds pretty good - we will defiantly be back again..",

    "text": "Normally I would give this restaurant 5 stars and a great review but my last dinner changed all of that. I have eaten at Fat Ox multiple times before, and have always ordered the same entree. I have specified to my server each time dining that I do not eat meat, but I will eat fish. I've always ordered the Swordfish entree, which on the menu is described as \"en Brodo, artichoke, fennel, olives, swiss chard\" ( I literally copied this from their online menu). I've also had my server go into the kitchen and double check that there is no meat in this entree. It was confirmed twice prior no meat, great.  We dined at Fat Ox Saturday 6/29 evening. Per usual, we asked for an appetizer recommendation that does not include meat, as I DO NOT EAT MEAT. Literally said those words to our server, which he and our assistant server acknowledged. He suggested the mussel appetizer. Great!  Ate the mussels, they were delicious. Was served my Swordfish entree and per usual again, wanted to double check that there was no meat. There are little peppers in the Swordfish that look like hot dog, so it always makes me feel better to double check. WHAT DO YOU KNOW!? The server nonchalantly, after I had eaten most of the meal, mentions oh yes! In fact, there is PORK SPREAD in BOTH THE MUSSELS AND MY SWORDFISH. Are you kidding me? This instantly upset me and we had to leave. How is your server going to recommend a dish to me that contains meat, when we specify I don't eat meat and ASK FOR A RECOMMENDATION THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE MEAT?! How, knowing this information, is he going to not disclose that the Swordfish has meat?! I am literally appalled that my dietary restrictions were completely ignored. What if I was deathly allergic? My Swordfish was comped, but I find this absolutely unforgivable. I was going to have my wedding rehearsal dinner here, which I will not now.   And to top everything off, I was so upset/ grossed out, I threw it up when I got home :)",

    "text": "We recently went to Fat Ox for a delayed Valentines/ anniversary dinner. We were seated promptly after checking in for our reservation. We noticed quite a few large groups throughout the restaurant. Seems to be a go to bachelorette dinner location. Our server arrived quickly and took our drink order and informed us of their service \"team,\" which is really was. All members of the wait staff were friendly and helpful and took good care of us. We started with the steamed mussels. Overall they were great. A couple tasted off, but the sauce and pesto served with it was delicious and overcome the couple of funky mussels. Next we had a lovely pasta dish with sausage and broccoli rabe. The broccoli rabe was more bitter than i was expecting, but once my palate acclimated, the remainder of the dish was delicious. We then moved on to the short ribs. These were incredible. Tender, full or flavor, and the bursts of pomegranate were unexpected but a lovely surprise. We finished off with the tiramisu which was pleasantly comp'd by the managers. And this tiramisu was incredible. My husband, who does not really like tiramisu commented that it was the best he's ever had, and may go back just for that and a drink.   It was definitely a lovely dinner with great service, ambiance, and decent food. Not my favorite, but definitely a place i will go back to for special occasions or even a trendy drink with my girlfriends.",

We had apps and split an entree, the food was top quality, complex flavors that were elevated, so far I'm in love with anything that Matt Carter is apart of. One of the best things I've ever tasted in my life is the pistachio gelato, it's creamy AF, I can't wait to go back and bring a friend. I'm going to a friends for dinner next Friday night and hopefully I can get the gelato to go and surprise them! Service was avg and slow; I ordered a pelligrino, it took almost 10 min, it didn't seem that busy but maybe the bartenders just couldn't get to it... Can't wait to go back is the morale of the story!",

I could have just had more of the tortellini and been satisfied but then came the Salmon and Felet... topped of with some Martinis... dam fine meals great prices full bar and great atmosphere!

They are either understaffed or just prolong the VERY LONG experience of dining. We all arrived at around 845. Apps were okay nothing to wow you AT ALL. The table side Caesar is okay to say the least. There is nothing special about it except that it is VERY salty. We ordered our food at about 915 food didn't arrive until almost 10!! I think they were trying to get us to order more wine. At that point the entire dinner party was aggravated and getting restless. We wanted no more drinks just our food!! The food arrived. EH! Not special either. The servers seemed annoyed also. I asked for a drink menu 2 times. I m not a fan of the Fat ox and would not recommend this overpriced eatery.",

She still has her Denver cell # since she moved out here a while ago. Needless to say, we not be dining here. Luckily, Steak44 made room for us at 6:00PM.

From the moment we sat down, he took the effort to place a black napkin under my wife's Bag on the table. Then he left us alone while we had our business conversation, only interpreting to get our drink order. After the perfect amount of time, he returned and seeing that we hadn't yet opened our menus, provided some excellent recommendations, so good in fact that we let him order our entire meal for us! His selections were masterful. My wife was given the best cut filet, with seasoned broccoli, our guest was prepared the most delicious short rib I've ever tasted, and I was served the largest and must succulent sea scallops I've ever had. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of Sauvignon blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand. For dessert Canton surprised us with a delectable chocolate mousse with a hard raspberry shell, the likes of which I will be unable to describe.  When the bill arrived, I was amazed at how affordable the price for all that we had was. I couldn't give this restaurant a higher recommendation!",

This was a completely different experience and we also loved it. The atmosphere almost made you feel as if you were in San Francisco or somewhere else wonderful. Beautiful space, open air, all of it. Jennifer and Anthony made our dining experience excellent. Attentive, yet not hovering, allowing us to take our time and enjoy the experience. Anthony made a great table side caesar that we shared. It was delicate and delicious. The white anchovies made it really special. My hubby does a great caesar and this one has him beat. We next enjoyed the white truffle, speck garganelli. SWOON! Absolutely lick your spoon delicious.  We also enjoyed the Filet with the Porcini sauce. It was appropriately crispy on the outside, mid rare inside (perfect) and we loved it.  We  were too full for dessert.  We felt it was the most enjoyable meal out in a very long time and will be back. We will try a whole new set of tastes next time.",

The manager, Darvay, greeted us at the door and showed us to our table.  We sat down and was immediately greeted by Canton, our server.  By far one of the coolest servers we have ever had.  He was very knowledgeable on everything in the menu.  Like this guy explained the dishes so well that it actually made it even harder on us to decide what to get.  Which was a good thing because we just ended up ordering half of the menu :).  We started with the burrata and prosciutto which was exquisite.  Canton also showed us to a couple fantastic cocktails I can not remember the names but one was like a tequila mule and the other was a smokey mezcal drink that was shaken and in a martini class...FANTASTIC!!  Next we had the ricotta pasta with rabbit tenderloin...AMAZING!!  Then we ordered not one, not two, but THREE entrees.  He explained them so well that we couldn't resist.  We ordered the 18oz Ribeye, Half Jidori Chicken, Short Rib and a side of Cauliflower. They were all so delicious that I can't say I like any one more then the other.  Definitely a place you should be prepared to drop some coin if you want to have the WHOLE experience.  We literally almost ordered the 40oz Porter House as well but didn't want to get too out of control. Next time FOR SURE! Canton brought us out an AMAZING red Toscana blend called ARCANUM.  It was a 2005 and one of the best wines that I've ever had.  Paired so well with all the different flavors we had on the table.  They said it was the last bottle so hopefully they get some more in soon please!  We obviously had plenty to box up for left overs tomorrow and we had to save room for dessert.  We finished with a couple shots of Avion tequila that Canton brought out with 2 orange slices that had sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top.  Very smooth tequila but my girlfriend I both agree that the orange slices just made to awesome!!  We will be taking that secret back home with us, thank you!  We also had the tiramisu which was simply to die for.  We definitley finished every bite.  We will be back for sure.  Requesting Canton as well.  He really hit it out of the park!",

My husband and I decided to split an order and were dumbfounded when it came out. The kitchen was very backed up and there wasn't an opportunity to put in an additional order. I sat through the rest of the meal while the other three folks at the table had their own entrees. The waiter seemed to be annoyed and frustrated by our questions about portion size, etc. Good wine and craft cocktails. I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "This is my fourth visit to Fat Ox. I love the look that they have pulled off. The bar is great, awesome cocktails, great wine list, and really good food. The attention we received from the moment we entered, were served a complimentary low alcohol Italian red Brachetto, and through the courses was fantastic. The one mis-step was on the most recent visit, where 4 requests from our server did not bring extra bread to accompany the two tiny pieces that came with the beautiful mussels and were inadequate to blot up the great sauce, until 30 seconds after the bowl and remaining sauce were taken away. Matt Carter's kitchen has a way with the wonderful pastas and meat courses. Like the other good Phoenix Kitchens at Virtu, Tratto, Crudo or Binckley's, expect plates of fantastic food, not giant portions of mediocre food. I have heard complaints about both quantity and wine price.  I found the prices to be appropriate for what I was served. The meat quality was far superior to what I had at Mastro's City Hall when we couldn't get a table for a birthday last week at Ox. The lamb, scallops and skirt steak we have tried were delicious. We didn't enjoy the Calabrian cauliflower appetizer as much as the side dish version, but loved the Brussels sprouts, clams and mussels...except for our bread issue. The pastas, like the Casoncelli and lamb verde, were amazing. A real gem is the wine list. Steve Johnson is a VERY experienced Somm. He has all the big name and Italian cult wines that big spenders will order. Restaurants are in business to make a profit or they disappear. He also has a bunch of smaller production, solid wines known by Italian wine buyers in major markets for their value. But, he has gems that he has selected, and I have done this myself, with other wines. He may be the only person in Arizona bringing these wines in, which is why they are available and well priced on their list. I don't know those wines, because I haven't ever tasted them, but when I asked Steve for recommendations at lower price points he steered me that way, and they were better than some of my old standbys when I can't find any solid recommendations, for half the price.  Use the sommelier! He picked the wines. I have been in retail and importing for 2 decades so I know enough to know that he knows more than me about his own list. I love this place and hope that it can find the same success as Mission and Zinc! By the way readers, don't forget Virtu. It is one of our best food experiences, and I have had no trouble getting a table lately, when new, more expensive and mediocre Scottsdale places are packed.",

Had some potato appetizer which was quite small.  The cavatelli pasta dish was excellent.  The salmon and risotto was good, not great, but there was an awful odor from whatever the hell else was on that plate.  Kept thinking the fish was bad but it wasn't he fish.  And my nose is all congested and I could still smell it.   The service was not great.  Took a while for server to show up then drinks took a while.  They like to take the entire food order at once which is fine but I think he forgot to put in the order.  The appetizer took forever and table next to us who ordered after us, got there's 10 minutes before ours.  They have limited beer section.  Didn't order wine.  Wife and I were both a little tired so ordered a latte after appetizer.  That took a while and didn't bring us any sugar.  After pasta, I wanted another beer which waiter never brought, but didn't charge for either.   Never saw the waiter after the pasta.  Someone brought the salmon dish and our server never came back to the table.  Another server finally got us our check.  Our server was probably somewhat new but someone should have supervising him better.",

Some naysaying reviewers were complaining about portions. Not me. I left full. The Squid Ink linguine was outstanding and unique. The filet mignon was perfectly prepared, and obviously prime with a great smokey flavor that was outstanding. For dessert the olive oil cake was fabulous. Just the right blend of bitter and sweet. My wife had tiramisu which she said was outstanding. Great wine list. This spot will be put in our \"high end\" rotation of restaurants. Yes, its expensive, but I believe the value is there. Also, plenty of self parking. Valet at restaurants is just annoying to me.",

The rest of the decor...clearly alot of money was put into it but it's a mix of 80's and dark decor- not my cup of tea but that's ok.  Service- good but felt like they were consistently apologizing for things.  Sorry we don't have a lunch menu yet, we haven't decided on brunch because the chef can't get it right, sorry no specials. Don't have happy hour but we're thinking about it....REALLY- no happy hour!   Argued when we commented about the RIDICULOUSLY high prices....it's not New York!  They claimed to be inline with Houston's, Steak 44 etc but at least you don't leave there hungry!  I totally agree so many restaurants waste food and go over board- but this is the opposite extreme.  I left hungry and a couple of hundred dollars out of pocket.    The food is very good- can't argue that but THE PORTIONS ARE TINY.  Ordered Caesar salad. It was good...little soggy but good flavor but again SMALL!  Tortellini.....fabulous but 5 MINIATURE pieces. FIVE!!!!  Glass of wine minimum $17   Guys- you run some wonderful restaurants and this has the elements to be one of them but take the prices down a notch and increase the food portions otherwise I'm afraid you won't be around too long.",

We were seated on the patio and waited on by a team of servers (they use the team approach at this restaurant and it works!) consisting of Lindsay and Cantenn and they knocked it out of the park! Lindsay did the Caesar salad, adding anchovies on the side for me, and Cantenn provided the wine selection and menu suggestions. He is interested in restaurant management and it shows. Knowledgeable and affable!! The dinner suggestions were perfect but I really have to rave about the linguine. You wonder how linguine could even be that good but to the chefs credit it was incredibly unique and worth the return just for that. The sauce had a discrete crunchiness to it that is hard to explain but was a homerun. It's right down the street from where we live and honestly, we left wondering why we don't go back more often!!! Great job everyone!!!",

Really cool atmosphere, but be warned, it was loud.  I had to lean in to talk to my bf next to me and it was next to impossible to hear what the group was saying at the other end of the table.  Our service experience was interesting.  They have only been open about a month and I could tell they still had a few kinks to work out.  For starters they ran out of menus.  They told us this off the bat so for our group of 10 we only had 5 menus for the table.  At one point in the evening, a server came up to me and asked if he could have my menu so he could give it to another table.  Not a huge deal, but really?  Not having enough menu's especially on a Friday night? Our server was a little bizarre. He was really over the top and theatrical but in an off putting way.  He was efficient but a little cringey.  We ordered an array of appetizers,pastas and sides to share and yes, the portions are very small.  With the pasta dishes I was able to have exactly 1 noodle per dish. Still very delicious though.  For my main dish I ordered the Creekstone Filetto.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.v  My overall experience here was fine, a nice night out, but I don't think the quality of food matched the pricing.",

We started with the tableside caesar salad (fantastic!), we followed it up with 2 pastas - the garganelli (simply divine) and the strozzapreti (simple, but tasty) - my absolute favorite part of the meal, continued our entrees with the skirt steak, scallops and salmon and ended the meal sharing a beautiful lemon tart.  The dessert took a while to come out, but the server proactively came over and said it was on the house for the delay - what a nice touch!  Fat Ox is a must visit for a great dining experience!",

    "text": "While this is a review about Fat Ox, I must say that as someone who relies on Yelp reviews for many things, I find people who irresponsibly apply 1 or even 2 stars for things like...   \"The prices are crazy and portions are for a toddler. The chef wants the customers to \"share\" their tiny portioned food?!\" -Quote per Phoenix A. Paradise Valley, AZ  ...are doing a disservice to the establishment and really are ones I dismiss as folks who probably should be dining for fast food or staying home with a frozen dinner.  If noise level is high, well, that's a personal preference, but not something that should deter one from visiting.  If you said noise was high because piped in music was blaring or they had a rock band playing behind my table, that'd make sense.  Don't ding them for something others might find a positive.  In fact, Fat Ox has a remarkable vibe and that seems obvious by most people enjoying themselves, which is brought on in part by the overall exuberance of the staff and patrons to the happening experience.  \"The lighting is very dim...for me...too dark.  I didn't actually see my food until I looked at my photos I took.\" -Quote per Pepper T. Phoenix, AZ  Seriously?  Maybe put your damn cell phone away, put your spectacles on, take a deep breath and look at your food!  Then engage your brain and don't do what someone on Faceplant told you to do!!!  I bet you text while driving too.  I guarantee you surely don't use the turn signal you paid for!  Dismiss this \"dim\" nonsense!  There are a lot of complaints about portion sizes.  America is so conditioned to super-size marketing that when served an appropriate portion, somehow value comes into question!  The value of Fat Ox is in the chef's preparation, presentation and servers service!  Side bet: I bet all the \"portion\" complainers leave cheap tips too!  My wife's and my order was as follows: -Navigation (bar) - $15 -Tableside Caesar Salad - $17 -Agnolotti - $16 -Braised Lamb - $32 -Duroc Pork Tomahawk - $32 -Wine (2 glasses) F-rench Press Total with tip, $215.  No problem with portion sizes.  The \"tableside\" in the Tableside Caesar Salad is a borrowed concept from The Mission with their tableside guacamole, another great Matthew Carter/Brian Raab restaurant in Old Town (soon to be a second location in North Scottsdale).  We found our salad quite tasty and well portioned.  The total meal was ample and we finished all our food.  We found the Agnolotti very tasty and representative of what we expected portion wise.  We sampled each other's entrees and found each to be 5-star taste.  My wife and I are not overweight, heavy eaters, nor desire the \"OMG, I can't believe I ate the whole thing\" post dining feeling to call is a great restaurant experience.  Value was perfectly acceptable per fine dining.  Our server Jamar was fantastic in his menu knowledge, attentiveness, and answered all our questions.  Sommelier Steve Johnson gave me, someone who is not a wine connoisseur, a perfectly great and reasonably priced wince choice based on my taste preference.  Apologies for turning my restaurant review in part to a social media rant.  With the likes of Twitterdumb, Gulp, Faceplant and such, everyone now has a microphone, which requires more responsibility with such a platform, which our society of course can no longer resist to display its never-ending stupidity.  As I heard recently, it used to be the dumb kids sat in the back on the class.  Now they all sit in the front row!  Ultimately (no, not \"at the end of the day\"), I highly recommend Fat Ox.  5+ STARS!",

Our waiter was polite but extremely SLOW & very inattentive...Muscles & cauliflower appetizer 2 start our dining experience took 35min to deliver, & rather than explaining that he perhaps forgot to submit the order, he merely said \"the kitchen is so busy, sorry for the delay\"  A swordfish dish ordered was terribly overcooked & the ribs delivered were ICE COLD... (These guests are extremely low maintenance I might add) & in brief mention to our waiter, he elected to \"re-order\" the ribs in hopes they were warmer, & left the swordfish to be literally untouched. The ribs arrived  when everyone else had completed their meal, only to be placed in a to-go box!!! A glass of pricey champagne was served in a wine glass, (the flute glass serves a purpose in retaining the bubbles) We were told the bartender was young & felt like all champagne was Proseco (lame explanation) The server realized our disappointment & offered to comp desert!!! Considering our bill was over $700. (Lots of great wine consumed) it would seem complimentary desert was the least one could do to salvage a bad experience.... Luckily, it was several close friends enjoying each-others company but sadly, not the restaruant. Unfortunate because the ambiance & location is terrific, we won't be returning... I wish now I had paid closer attention to a review I had read in Trends magazine that was not positive.",

    "text": "I came here last night with my family and was really excited to try something new. I had heard such great things with Fat Ox so I went as soon as I could. The interior is really beautiful. The bar was nice and the place was dark. Now for the review. The service was really good. However, I was not impressed. The set up for the portions is to share basically the entire menu and for the price is was not worth it. I'm a small girl but I have a big appetite! haha. So when I go to dinner and the menu is meant to be shared, I think the portions should be a decent size because it was really small. We skipped the antipasti portion of the menu. We had garganelli which was pretty good, the rigatoni lamb verde; decent, and the linguine clams. We did not like the linguine clams at all. The color for the linguine was red which from the salami and only added four clams that were already out of the shell. You couldn't taste the clams unless you got an actual piece of it. The manager came over immediately after finding out we didn't care for it at all and took it off the bill. For our main course I had the scottish salmon which was very bland, my dad had the lamb which he said tasted like a gyro, and we had the filetto which was good, not great. I have to say the best part of the meal was the dessert.",

I'm never huge into these, but if you are, they had good quality meats.  Something to be aware of-  their portions are fairly small - not huge portions that most \"Italian\" restaurants serve.  Definitely worth checking out if you've never been.",

The table side made and served homemade Caesar salad was incredible as was the homemade pasta dish and the glasses of wine and a few sides we split. As if that wasn't enough, we got their lemon and chocolate desserts and could barely walk out.

They sat us in the corner which actually allowed for a quiet start to our dinner so that was great. Then came our server - Amanda - she had wonderful recommendations and was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. My in laws were very impressed with her (as was I). When your server is that well versed it really creates an entire experience that everyone is interested in. Her Assistant whom I did not catch his name (darker salt and pepper hair) was also very attentive. He would listen to our conversation from a distance and start executing the plan before she was done interacting with us. The food was different- interesting for sure. I will most definitely return especially for a girls night. As far as the aesthetics of the venue went I enjoyed them.",

I highly recommend the Brussels sprouts, shrimp appetizer, the Gargenelli was fantastic-the speck was perfectly balanced in the pasta and it was rich and savory.

She went through their whole menu with me and I was able to choose from four different pasta meals and four different meals with meat. The manager was awesome, he came out with two glasses of champagne for my husband and I to congratulate us on our anniversary. He also took time to chat with us and he ended up giving other recommendations on places and restaurants to visit while we are here in Arizona.  I ordered the 25 layer lasagna with asparagus and my husband ordered the ribeye steak with asparagus and a salad that normally contained walnuts. The waitresses was super nice and put a note in with the order to leave the walnuts off so I could share it with my husband. The food portions were large and very filling and well worth the cost. My husband also just had a ribeye steak at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant and said, \"the Fat Ox's ribeye steak was better than Gordon Ramsay's.\"",

We were looking for modern Italian for one of our nights in Scottsdale, and Fat Ox presented our ideal restaurant. With a modern-rustic-chic interior, this upscale restaurant welcomed you to some of the best dining in Arizona.   Practically every dish we ordered was a home run, including presentation. From a delicious Caesar salad made table-side, to fresh mozzarella, to handmade pastas. The ribeye and salmon were also favorites. I honestly don't have enough space to outline every dish, but  just know that everything you order, especially if you like it normally, will be incredible from the Fat Ox. I'm glad I came with a group of 6 so that I had the chance to try as much of the menu as possible!   Our waiter also truly elevated the meal even further. He struck the perfect balance between attentiveness, conversation, and impeccable and professional service. We chose every dish he recommended, and he kept our glasses of both water and wine full without us even noticing.   Overall an amazing meal! We will be back!",

Beautifully lit space with glass walls you can see into the restaurant through. There are various rooms too that look perfect for a nice private dining occasion or group gathering. It definitely looks like a place to impress a first date or celebrate any romantic occasion. The staff again was attentive and knowledgeable- they didn't hover but were effortlessly providing great service never letting our wine glasses or water go empty. Regarding my allergy they made me feel like anything i was interested in they could find a way to give it to me modified so I would be safe. The food gave me no issues and I felt very comfortable in that respect and I genuinely appreciated it. We ordered the linguine that comes with a pork meat sauce and the scallops. I don't think I've ever had scallops at a restaurant that I disliked and the fact that this dish cost about $35 I was shocked at just how bad it was. Scallops usually come in a small portion so that was as expected... (although I'd love a restaurant to surprise me once) and they came with mushrooms and what appeared to be brussel sprout leaves and dots of a dark burgundy sauce. My first bite I was pulling things out of my mouth ...that's how off putting the texture was. The brussel sprouts leaves were burnt and chewy ...the scallops had no flavor that I could tell. Tried the sauce which tasted like bbq perhaps? But made absolutely no sense with the scallops or anything else on the plate. I was honestly so let down...$35!? then the linguine came which upset me at a glance just due to the portion...imagine twirling your fork into a big bowl of pasta, take that fork and put it on a plate - that was the serving size (okay a little bigger but you understand). The pasta itself - great! Good flavor and unique - marinara but it had a fresh almost lemon or something fresh taste and that made it more sad that it was pretty much gone in 2 bites. I left starving - and with tip spent about $128 (including a bottle of prosecco that was average priced). It was very very disappointing. I don't think it's right that a restaurant charges so much for pasta and gives you a ridiculous portion. Or charges so much for any dish and doesn't deliver on taste. I've been twice now and the price just blows me out of the water for the either mediocre food or the small portions. I'm willing to pay for great food but I think it's insane to pay close to $130 anywhere and leave hungry (I genuinely went home and ate pasta there). It's a shame because the staff and ambiance are incredible. I hate to say I wouldn't go back.",

Interior, decor, lighting. 4 stars.   The rest...well... We were sat promptly. Our server arrived quickly. Took drink orders. Awesome. Everyone (including a bottle of wine, martini, beer) all arrived within 15 mins. Seemed long given the restaurant was 40% full (once again being kind). My glass of wine. Glass of wine on the wine by the glass menu. Tick tock. Tick tock. Appetizers hello. How are you? Mr. burrata, what happened? Where is the rest of you? 4 small fig halves for 6 people, and literally a dollop of daisy size burrata. Ummm where's my glass of wine. Super fun watching the rest of the party enjoying cocktails and wine. Server? Beep beep? Finally random person finally brings my glass of wine. Doesn't it all come from the same place?  Whatever, I'm just happy to receive my first glass of wine as the rest of my party is ordering their second.  I'll move along, make this as quick as possible. The swordfish is overcooked, and the size of a poached egg. Pared with what appeared and tasted like frozen spinach, bell pepper and kale. The scallops were more of a appetizer portion. Short ribs may of possibly been the best out of the bunch but still fall short.  Fat Ox is just another sad attempt to oversaturate Scottsdale. The flavors and potions do not justify the price. My purse got a napkin. But still sat on the floor. With tip. $700 Pricetag. And we all needed to get food our way home. Look forward to what takes their place in a year.",

    "text": "I do not understand the negative reviews of this place. My husband and I went here last night to celebrate his birthday and it was honestly one of the best meals that we have ever had. Granted, this place has quite a scene starting at around 8 o'clock on a Saturday evening but it ends pretty quickly. If you can get beyond the half-dressed women and their ridiculous male counterparts that only Scottsdale provides I think that you'll find that this place is actually fantastic. We started with cocktails which word delicious-some of the best that we've ever had. For food we started with the Buffalo mozzarella which had a delicious citrus flavor and progressed to the lamb Ragu which is a must try and the butternut squash ravioli which had flavors that were totally unique. While the portion size of the pastas could have been larger our waitress Amanda was attentive and knowledgeable and guided us appropriately through the menu including the wine list which she knew perfectly. She recommended a bottle of nebiolo which was affordable and fantastic! Apparently you can make a reservation and request a waitress-- I would highly recommend requesting Amanda she was honestly wonderful. For our main course we had the half chicken which was totally unique and delicious and the salmon which was cooked perfectly. They generously recognized my husband's birthday by providing us a dessert on the house, a delicious tiramisu that we devoured. Again it was an absolutely fantastic evening. There's nothing that I would change about this place. If you have time to have a relaxed dinner and you're going out for special occasion I would give this place a try. It's very special.",

    "text": "Disappointing! The front staff is great and the ambience is really nice. And that's all the great things that you're going to experience. We ordered a Caesar salad, which was very bland. Nothing like you would expect a Caesar salad to be.  We ordered the Buratta, and a couple of pastas that were okay. Nothing worth the price of them. We then ordered the filet steak, which tasted like it was burnt, and honestly I feel you could get a better cut of meat from whole foods than this place. With our state came out of side which our waiter never told us about and it tasted like vomit. By this point we were hoping the desserts would be so good that it may make up for the meal. Unfortunately we were wrong. We ordered the olive oil cake and the tiramisu. The olive oil cake had way too much orange flavor to it and the tiramisu was more of a chocolate brownie on the bottom with a cheesecake layering on top then a traditional Italian tiramisu. Then we ordered some cappuccinos and after one and a half sips we were done. I asked the waiter did we order espresso's, he said no they were cappuccinos. The service we got was very poor, they don't tell you about sides to meals and their overall guidance for you for the evening for your first time there is very underwhelming. All in all we will not be returning, even if they paid us to come back! Extremely disappointed, and avoid this place and make the better decision to have True Italian food, because this place does not serve anything like Italy has. Founder must have been drinking too much wine to remember what Italian food should be like. Avoid this place!",

To me, it was really unmemorable and to be honest, vaguely Italian in comparison to Zinc's on point rendition of a 7th arrondisement brasserie. Incredibly loud and super dark even for me and I love good high energy restaurant as much as the next 30 something Scottsdale chick. Way too much meat on the menu - salmon as the only option for fish eating folk? Salmon is the new chicken these days. Portions didn't make sense - mussels starter could have fed 6 people, but two teaspoons of burrata was barely enough for everyone at our table to have a lick. Perhaps I'll try this again in the future as a girlfriend's lunch spot, as lunch is what Zinc really nails for me, but for now its a pass. Bummer.",

    "text": "Being Italian and from New Jersey, I've been to many wonderful Italian restaurants in my life, but Fat Ox was an original  gastronomic experience for sure! I had never tasted prosciutto that was so tender. Squid ink pappardelle with laughing bird shrimp and calamari had more flavor than seems legal. The Garganellii pasta with speck was out of this world. And don't even get me started on the amazingly tender scallops that melted like butter in my mouth. Elijah Davis was working the room and made a Caesar salad that just oozed of his showmanship and love. He made the whole night so special! And our waiter Richie and the manager Darva went out of their way as well and made us feel like VIPs. When Elijah insisted on coffee and dessert I thought I would explode but it was well worth it! Again the BEST tiramisu I have ever eaten. Even the bread with the whipped ricotta and cheesy butter was a special touch. An hour spent after dinner enjoying a top-quality bourbon at the bar with bartender Britney was a most pleasant way to top off a great evening. She is a pleasure to chat with. Run, don't walk, to Fat Ox when you want a meal and an evening that will surely stand out in your memory. And if you're lucky, Elijah Davis will be working that night and amaze you!",

    "text": "Before Fat Ox's much acclaimed open, I called for a reservation for my party of 8. A few days before our dinner, I personally went to the Fat Ox and requested the large table in the back room as it was quieter. I also told the hostess when she called to confirm my reservation that I wanted the back room. Arriving on time for our reservation, our party was given a table in the noisy bar area. Although they were able to give us a table that was located more in the dining room, it was not what I requested not once, not twice, but three times. We were off to a shaky start. As far as the food...we were encouraged by our server to do a family style way of dining on the different courses. The four women of the group decided on our first course of a caeser salad. It was too lemony for my liking, as I enjoy more of a parmesan taste. The second course was the Casoncelli and Strozzapreti. As far as the family style of sharing, the four of us could have two tablespoons of Casoncelli (butternut squash) and two pasta noodles on the Strozzapreit (pasta and tomato sauch). Our entree that 3 of us split (one woman had the ligunine and clams, double portion as an entree) was the Skirt Steak Tagliata, which was presented pre sliced. We could each have two slices, one tablespoon of polenta and a two tablespoons of mushrooms. They were out of our requested tiramisu and comped us some other deserts.  The food is delicious; however the servers need to be clearer with their portion size. And to leave the restaurant feeling full, you will pay for that feeling. For the four of us, our caeser was $34, second course was $30 and the entrees were $38 and $36.  Will we come back? After the problem with the table, it's a bitter pill to swallow. But the food is delicious, but more managable if you go just as a couple portion-wise. ALso, if you are with a group, don't expect to hear anyone at the opposite end of the table. This place is busy and noisy.",

We spent $400 with only 3 glasses of wine, and left hungry!.   We were excited to dine at Fat Ox, being fans of The Mission, Zinc Burger and House Brasserie.    We arrived a few minutes early, and were asked to wait because they didn't have any menus!  The front reception area is chaotic, and the staff, of whom there are many, don't know what is going on.  Once seated, we ordered the Caesar salad.  The flavor was OK, but the portion size was tiny - 4 lettuce leaves.  We ordered a couple of pastas for the table, the tortellini and another pasta stuffed with salamis, etc.  When the orders arrived, our guests burst out laughing - they thought it was a joke.  5 teeny tiny tortellini. Flavors were bland.  The main courses were equally small, and, sadly, quite tasteless.  My husband ordered the 7 oz filet, which wasn't even 4 oz.  The scallops were an appetizer size.  The veal was a decent portion, but shockingly undercooked.   The bread basket consisted of large croutons.  When we asked for me, the server told us we would have to pay extra!  Yikes!!  Don't go!!!",

The service in the dining room was good too, with the waiter and staff being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.   And, the waiter did warn us that the portions were small.   I guess, given the healthy prices, I didn't think he meant THAT SMALL.   The pasta dishes were tasty, but very small.   I mean really, really small plates.  Specifically, the Casoncelli and Garganelli.   What really turned me off on this place though was the entree I ordered, the Costata.   This is a $65.00 grilled ribeye steak.   The menu says it is 18 oz.   It was not even close to that size.   Much smaller.  It came sliced up and was dressed up with peppers and onions, but it was a very small amount of edible meat.  There was a meatless bone, and the slices of beef were absurdly fatty.   I understand a ribeye can be a little fatty and that is part of why it tastes good, but this was way too fatty for my taste.   Bottom line, the food tastes good, but this place is way too expensive for what you get.",

All the wait staff was attentive and pleasant, recommending dishes and drinks.  We started with the mussels in red sauce (amazing), next on to squid ink pasta, and finally on to our entrees - Branzino special and the bone-in ribeye.  Both were to die for.  The ribeye came sliced into several thick slabs and melted in your mouth.  We finished with the olive oil cake and left fantastically satisfied and not uncomfortable.  To top it off, I didn't feel the price was too much for the wonderful experience.  Will certainly be back !",

We began with a prosuitto and mushroom appetizer, followed up with rigatoni lamb verde, and finished with scallops accompanied by mushrooms and pancetta.

My appetizer was a pasta dish I had never had before - and it was most enjoyable  The steak that my wife had was perfectly cooked to medium rare. Fortunately her portions were so large that we shared half of her steak the next morning as steak & eggs. Deserts were lovely and also excellent. I appreciated their by-the-glass wine selections. They offer an extensive selection of excellent Italian wines. I enjoyed s lovely Primitivo  A tad noisy when it filled to capacity / but what the heck - it was Friday night  If you want to give modern Italian a try the Fat Ice is the place to do so. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Pretentiousness at its finest. I went here yesterday for happy hour. I made reservations FOR HAPPY HOUR, as the website appeared to allow this. I arrived 15 minutes prior to my 2 girlfriends, so I sat at the bar. For 10 minutes, the short, stocky bartender with facial hair ignored me; no greeting, no water, no menu...nothing. Accordingly, I went to the hostess stand and asked if I could be seated early, and without the rest of my party because the bartender wasn't interested in serving me. Oddly enough, I got no response to this bit of detail. I was seated though. After being seated I noticed that I didn't get a happy hour menu so I relayed my online reservation story. After which, a nice young man and nice young lady explained that happy hour was in the bar area only. I told the nice young lady that was odd because their website allowed me to make happy hour reservations. At any rate she found a table top for us in the bar area. The Margarita that I ordered was quite watered down and not tasty at all. The Tom Gore Cabernet Sauvignon was delicious. Then we ordered the burrata, the veal meatballs and the calamari. The burrata and veal meatballs were so tiny that the portions reminded me of tapas. Also, the calamari was very non-traditional (fried in black squid ink); our server did not warn us that it wasn't the traditional calamari. At any rate the food was good. Then, because of the small portion sizes, we ordered another round of different food. I had the Gigli pasta, delicious. THEN, the bill came...$136.07! Happy hour, for 3?? I don't think so.",

    "text": "Not sure where to start...we had such an incredible experience here!  First the setting - indoor/outdoor. Perfect warm spring evening. The design is what I might call - modern bistro meets old school steak house. Chic, crisp, and at the same time it carried the old school accoutrements with some booths and the fine attention to detail...all the way down to the restrooms.  Oh, and the bar area had the key TV's showing the right sports action that the men in our group were hoping for. Second - the service. I'm not just taking about our waiter (who was a pro) but also his supporting staff were flawless, smiling all the time. We felt as welcome as if we were at my best friends house. In fact there were layers of supporting and managing staff who continued to look after every detail. Third - the food. Wow. Wow. Wow. Matt and his team in the kitchen turned out dish after dish of exquisite food prepared to order. We had half our table gluten free. They found a way to make essentially every dish gluten free as well (the ladies loved that!). And of course there were a few \"this is on the chef\" surprises which put it all over the top. We never felt rushed - even though I'm sure we took the table for much longer than they had anticipated.  Whether you are coming with your significant other or with a larger group - the Fat Ox will surpass your needs. Highly recommended. Highly!",

However, when we experienced our New Year's Eve dinner, it was very disappointing.  We were enticed to consider an additional menu item on a fixed priced menu and were not told it was an additional up charge.  To our dismay, the up-charge was 125% above the fixed price.  Most certainly, this should have been disclosed and agreed upon.  In addition, the glass of Prosecco, that was included in the fixed menu, was actually nothing more than a taste.    Very disappointed on their deception to their guest on New Year's Eve!!!",

    "text": "My experience at the Fat Ox was a mixed bag of good, bad and just awful (I got food poisoning from their Scallops). The evening started out great, our server Eric was great and seemed attentive (initially), he walked us through the menu and gave some recommendations of what dishes were great and gave a couple cocktail recommendations. He took our order and then basically disappeared the entire evening outside of us flagging him down for a cocktail and the very very seldom \"everything good\" check-in. It kind of seemed like a lot of other staff were picking up his slack.  Per Eric's recommendation I tried the Navigation cocktail which is made with ketel one vodka, chamomile, lemon juice, Chartreuse. It is served up with an egg white foam on top. The cocktail was great but the bartender gave me a cocktail full of ice chips which was frustrating and really took away from the cocktail. I personally find it super unappealing and frustrating to get a cocktail with bits of ice floating when the drink  is meant to be served up. I also tried their Sicilian Sunset (Stoli vodka, Lillet Rose, passion fruit), I really enjoyed it. It was sweet but not too sweet; I found it to be pretty perfectly balanced. I would for sure order that again.   Now on to the food, we ordered the following items from their 4 course price fixe menu   Antipasti: :: Calabrian Cauliflower, Barolo Salami, Fennel and Arugula :: Bellweather Farms Ricotta, Prosciutto, Shaved Trumpet Mushrooms and Hazelnut  Primi Piatti: :: Ricotta Cavatelli, Pulled Chicken, Rosso Vin Cotto, Caper, Olive and Almond :: Squid Ink Linguine, Fennel, Tomato, Pork Sugo, Preserved Lemon and Bottarga  Secondi Piatti: :: Short Rib Alla Vaccinara, Barolo Agrodolce, Celery Puree, Charred Broccolini :: La Belle Farms Duck Breast, Horseradish Creamed Leek, Potato, Blackberry :: Maine Diver Scallop, Fregola, Cotechino, Preserved Lemon, Almonds  Dessert: :: Gianduja Grangelico Tiramisu, Roasted Banana, Espresso Gelato :: Meyer Lemon Semifreddo, Lambrousco Strawberry. Chiffon  For the first course, I really enjoyed both dishes. The Cauliflower was really the True standout, the Bellweather Farms Ricotta was delicious but I felt like it needed some form of texture. The prosiutto and the shaved trumpet mushrooms had really similar constancies and I just felt like they got lost a little bit in the ricotta, it needed some salt too... It would have really benefited from a sprinkling of some Maldon salt.   For the second course both the Ricotta Cavatelli and the Squid ink linguine were both perfectly cooked. The Ricotta Cavatelli was my favorite out of the two dishes, just a ton of great flavors going on in that dish. The Squid ink linguine again kinda lacked flavor, it really kind of fell flat. The couple of squid rings served with it were super overcooked as well.     For the Second Piatti, the Short Rib again was the standout - I felt like I was eating my friends dinner more than mine. They were perfectly braised, fall apart delicious, I wish they had served more of the celery root puree with it!   I initially got the La Belle Farms Duck Breast, but it was so overcooked that honestly it was almost inedible and (again) lacked any flavor. They basically cut up a couple of blackberries and put them on the dish and there wasn't really any sauce to try and add to the duck. Thankfully, a server (not ours) saw that I wasn't really eating the dish and asked if I was enjoying it. He was kind enough to bring me a replacement dish (the scallops). As soon as they brought the scallops out, they smelled fishy and when I tried one they tasted SUPER fishy. Fishy smell and taste with a shell fish is never a good thing. Lo and behold last night.... I got SICK.   The deserts were good, the Tiramisu was great but the Meyer Lemon Semifreddo didn't have any of that tart lemon flavor.   So some of the dishes were great, the portions were adequate - not huge but not tiny like some people have suggested. We did have bouts of great service, but unfortunately it wasn't from our server. Eric was MIA most of the evening, we hardly saw him and when you have a missing server it really is just a bummer. It takes away from the meal, but that's me... I'd eat mediocre food all day long if the service is amazing. I am bummed that I got sick from the scallops, kind of a bad way to end an evening.   Would I come back... I don't know. It's hard to look past the super spotty bordering on bad service and getting sick at the end of the evening. But I am intrigued because some of the dishes were great and I would be interested in trying more (maybe not order fish in the future? IDK).",

Sarah was very attentive serving us in the bar area. When our table was ready we were well cared for by two friendly waiters that were very professional and knowledgeable. The table side prepared Caesar salad is worth coming for alone. The flavors of anchovies, fried capers, and lemon are so amazing that it'll be impossible not to order it every time I go there. Every single dish down to the bread and butter is obviously thought out to the smallest detail and beautifully plated. We followed the salad with the small order of mussels. It is a perfect size for two. They were perfectly cooked  and served in a tomato broth that will make you have to decide whether to dip your bread into it or enjoy the homemade Calabrian butter and ricotta cheese served with the bread. The Rosso Crest Di Gallo is handmade by Chef Steve Chops and incredibly delicious. Finally, we enjoyed the ribeye with brussels for the main course. It was perfectly cooked and served sliced into strips. We shared everything so I'm not sure if they did that for us or if that's how it is always served. I can't wait to try every item on their menu. The dinner was such a wonderful experience but our conversations with Brent who manages the Fat Ox and Chef Chops really made the evening extra special. The only negative is that the entire parking lot is valet. I personally can't stand being forced to use valet services.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Since it was restaurant week, we opted in for the $44 per person menu. We got to choose an appetizer, main course and dessert each. We started ourselves with wine and the complimentary bread. The bread was olive oil, rosemary tasting with a side of spicy dip or olive oil cheese. We were both a fan of the bread and the cheese dip! Yum! We then started with our appetizers: scallops crudo & burrata di bufala which were both good but nothing exceptional. The scallops were really thin pieces and the burrata di bufala was also small bites but the taste was more unique and impressional. For the mains, we had: Ora king salmon & short rib vaccinara. The short rib was god and so was the salmon, but not impressionable either. However, they were still decent and tasted good, so it was solid. For desserts, we ended with: lemon panna cotta & gianduja franjelico tiramisu - the tiramisu didn't taste like the usual moist ones I e had, but I liked it a lot! The toasted banana bits and chocolates weren't overpowering to each other nor was it too sweet, a fan of it and would recommend to order. As for the lemon panna cotta, it was good too so not a bad choice to order either. We got pleasantly surprised with two glasses of complimentary champagne for our anniversary which was very sweet of the restaurant. Overall, solid and decent.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, I really did. I'm from Portland Oregon, and I am a server at a resort in paradise valley, so I work in the industry. I have lived in arizona for less than a year, hense I still have a oregon ID since that is the place I have resigned my 23 years. My first visit, my husband and I sat at the bar, I was told I could not be served due to my oregon ID, When asked if that was a fat ox rule I was told, it was a arizona state rule. Again I have lived here for over a year, I have bought liquor I've gone to a bunch of bars and never once has this been mentioned to me, again I do work in the service industry and this is never ever been something that is True. Fast forward till most three months later, my husband and I to the decided to try and give this place another chance. This time we chose to sit in the restaurant, it was supposed to be a very busy night so the only reservation we could make was at 5 o'clock, when we got there at 5 o'clock there was nobody in the restaurant we were the only table to be sat. My husband and I then ordered drinks, and we were not Asked for ID, no big deal, while our drinks were in transit to our table we were asked by our server if he could see our IDs because the bartender remembered us from three months prior, and that we might be offering fake IDs, I work in the service industry and this is extremely  offensive to us plus our drinks are already almost at the table so if they were fake you've already messed up because you've served us. Then he did serve us, but I have worked in MANY restaurants and this is by far the most UNPROFESSIONAL approach. Our server was very friendly, but our night was dampened by the fact that the same rude bartender was questioning my id! I had a now Arizona and passport with me to prove I am almost 24! The food was mediocre and after this experience, after giving a second chance I will never be back. Plus when guests at my resort ask I will absolutely say to avoid this place. During our 17 dollar table side Caesar the S.A did not once explain what he was doing or even interact with us. I will never be back, joke of a place for the area. There are plenty more WAY nicer places don't waste your time.",

We arrived for our reservation and were shown to a \"table\" that could barely fit two people, placed in the middle of the room. We asked if a different table was a available (several were unoccupied), but were told they were for \"reservations.\" Seems our reservation was not as important as others.  The food may be great, but I won't find out. Sitting in the middle of a room at a postage stamp sized table is not something I am interested in.",

    "text": "First time to this restaurant. Nice venue and intimate feel even though its a big place. The menu looked so very good online but the food did not measure up for several reasons .  There were 6 of us who shared 3 orders of the Caesar salad.  It was well made and tasty but my portion was about 4 forkfuls. This is particularly upsetting and set the stage for what I feel is how they roll at this place. My friend had the \"25 layer\" lasagna which tasted good but was super small at about 4 inch by 3 inch as the name deceives. Two of my friends had the filet and liked their meals. The salmon was also very good.  I had the spaghetti with clams. It was delicious but only had one or 2  small non-tender clam pieces. I am Italian and although the flavors were outstanding I would be ashamed to serve this in my house. It could have been called \" spaghetti with a clam\".   The service was very slow and after  more 1.5 hrs we were ready for desert. My pana cotta tasted like it had refrigerator burn.  It looked pretty, and tasted good but fell short again because it definitely was not fresh.   I was looking forward to a great meal when I reserved. The review I read must have been done on one of their good nights. Personally I  think this restaurant is skimping on things. They charge a lot for their food and do not deliver.",

Also they let us stay after the restaurant closed to take pictures by the tree. They were very accommodating for us and I will definitely be coming back.

They knew how to pair the wine with your entree and what would bring the notes forward for the best experience. I have a terrible pallet when it comes to wine tasting. LoL Give a dry Cab and that's about the extent of my pallet. LoL   The food was well prepared and the sauces were fresh with a from scratch taste. The pasta was delicious, which we had no complaints. You couldn't possibly go wrong. I had the sword fish (amazing) and the classic 25 layer lasagna to try (I planned on taking the rest for a lunch the next day lol) and it was absolutely the best lasagna I've had in a good while. The sauce was consistent and not cheese overwhelming as some lasagna you may find elsewhere.   As for pricing, it's what you would expect and consistent with the quality and atmosphere. If your expecting a budget friendlier fare, you may wanna stick with Oreganos possibly. This is par for the service and overall experience.   Great for a happy hour and the patio is wonderful. Thanks for a great experience Fat Ox!",

I asked our server James if the restaurant ever offered a Chef's tasting menu as we went through the menu with him (thinking it may be a future dining option). James was excited to offer us a family style dining experience which allowed us to taste quite a few different menu items. My personal favorites were the mussels, beef tartare, Garganelli pasta, roasted cauliflower, short ribs, grilled pork and Affogato.  James and his partner (apologies for not recalling his name) were fantastic in every aspect of their craft and are strongly recommended. We really put our menu in he hands of James and the kitchen and we were all blown away with the phenomenal meal, start to finish! I would be remiss if I did not mention that the meal was taken to the next level by the wine pairings selected by Mark, the restaurant's Somm. Mark knocked it out of the park with his awesome (and sensible) selections. This is the sort of effort that separates the good places from the great ones.  Thanks to everyone at Fat Ox for making our evening fantastic!",

    "text": "We've tried this restaurant a couple of times now. I wanted to give it a try again before I wrote a review.  It was surprisingly easy and straight forward to get reservations for a Saturday evening and we were seated as soon as we got there. There were 2-3 servers that approached our table and introduced themselves and said they'd be taking care of us but that changed pretty quickly. Our \"primary\" server Aaron knew the menu well and helped make selections but came across as a little pushy.. never felt that with a server so that takes away 1 star from my review.  Everything else was totally on point - decor, ambience, food, our secondary servers who did take over eventually.  House bread, butter and ricotta is phenomenal.  Table side Caesar salad 5/5 - must try!  While the scallops were a little too buttery and greasy,  the green tortellini blew my mind!   All dishes have a relatively smaller serving size.",

Mine and my daughters was delicious too. Plainly stated, the service was bad. It took 15!minutes just to get water. We asked for an additional water later on and the waiter opening our wine said \"this isn't my table. I am just doing him a favor.\" Our waiter was fine, perhaps a bit smug, but mostly just an infrequent visitor. We would have ordered dessert but we waited so long for the dessert menus that we just decided to pay the bill. This place could become a frequent rotation but not with service like this.  Standout dishes include the 25 layer lasagna and the short rib. Also the lentil side dish was delish. Salmon was good as was the gargonelli but it was really too salty and I don't think I have never said that about a dish. I love salt. The homemade pasta was amazing though. The grapefruit basil martini was a yummy start to the meal. The table side Caesar was a super cool concepts but didn't taste that good. The meat and cheese platter was amazing.",

I arrived a few minutes before our 7:30 reservation and were seated immediately. Their wine list is extensive, and their tables are set with the biggest wine goblets I've ever seen. They have a small but interesting cocktail (or \"oxtail\") menu, and my Bulleits over Bordeaux was strong and delicious. The dishes here are small, but well plated and definitely well done. I had the burrata di bufala, short rib vaccinara, and gianduja frangelico tiramisu. Short ribs are my go to order at most restaurants, and the ones here did not disappoint. The dish here came with three medallion sized pieces, which were perfectly fork tender and came with the most delicious glaze. I also stole a couple bites of my friend's Gigli dish, and the pasta was absolutely amazing. I'm not sure if the portions were smaller due to restaurant week, and I personally left pretty full, but a bigger eater might be left wanting. The desserts here were standard, good but not mind blowing. My tiramisu was creamy and fluffy without being too sweet, though it came on a solid chocolate base that made it a little challenging to eat. I did appreciate that they had espresso options as well as French pressed coffee. Service overall was very attentive, and the employees all looked genuinely happy to be at work, which is a huge plus.   Note: the parking lot by Fat Ox is pretty small and fills up quickly, but there's usually ample space over by Fogo de Chao.",

    "text": "We went for the first time to this restaurant during  Arizona Restaurant week-Spring 2018.(special menu-3 courses for $44/person) They also serve regular menu as well during this special event. We both started off  with the pasta. One of us had the Gigli and the other the Tagliatelle. The Gigli is on the regular menu, but the Tagliatelle is not.They were both excellent in portion,taste, & presentation. The next course we had Ora King Salmon-not on the regular menu, but there is a Salmon with crispy skin. The other Secondi Piatti was the Short Rib Vaccinara which is on the regular menu. Says it has raisins in this dish, but I did not see or taste them and I am not a fan of raisins.  Both second courses were excellent.  Dolce course we had Gianduja Franjelico Tiramisu which looked like 1/2 the portion from the photos I've seen from the regular menu and it also did not include the espresso gelato-which all was ok. The portion served was perfect and it was very good,especially the chocolate on the plate. The other dessert we had was the Bronte Pistachio gelato-2 scoops which is also on the regular menu.  Just a mention the first course on the \"special menu\" had a Burrata di Bufala which was different ingredients from the regular menu and the veal meatballs were also on the regular menu.  Our server Shaun was excellent and we also had another waiter come around and help out, very attentive service from the moment we sat down to the end. We were offered different types of water, we opted for the local Scottsdale water.  Another note we had a Bloody Mary and a Barrel aged(Buffalo Trace) Manhattan from the cocktail list. My DH finished the Bloody Mary the quickest I have seen him, so it must have been good. He usually never finishes a cocktail before I do or rarely finishes his alcohol.  The meats are slow roasted and the pastas made in house. We thought all the portions were a good size and did not leave hungry. Just a note we did not eat our \"normal\" full lunch portion either. We enjoyed our visit to Fat Ox.",

    "text": "My husband and I were so excited to try this place. Our waiter was so nice and he knew what he was doing. Everything was going well until we got our appetizers, which were great. And then we waited almost an hour to get our entrees. The waiter apologized and he said the kitchen sucks I'm sorry. Then the manager came and apologized to our table and then we got a complementary  drink. When we got our dessert my amaretto gelato came with a wrap paper on it.. it was disgusting to feel the paper in my mouth. I was really disappointed about that. I spoke with the manager on duty and he didn't say a word. He took the plate to the kitchen. I think this is a high-end restaurant and you don't expect things like this to happen in places like this. I work in a guest service environment and I'm definitely not recommending this place to my guests.",

My love had the trumpet mushrooms (only $9, really?) and the butternut squash pasta (hand rolled) . Topped it off with tiramisu and tawny port.  Fat Ox is an excellent addition to the Scottsdale restaurant scene. We will be regulars.",

The atmosphere is great, although the music was a tad loud but that's typically of Scottsdale restaurants. The service is exceptional, our waitress was entirely lovely, very prompt and genuinely seemed to enjoy her job. The pasta is above average and the wine list is pretty extensive. It is definitely not a cheap night out, so I'd say its the perfect spot for a special occasion or nice date. We will definitely be returning!!!",

What is this doing in such a classy and refined interior?? Wait...it gets worse! The men's restroom is filled - FILLED - with framed soft core porn. No artist name, no model name, but stock photos of nude and anonymous women. The women's restroom - similar but different. Boudoir style photos in every stall. If there's GOING to be sexy pics - how come women don't get to see boobs as well????? This is pre-WWI attitude about women on display in a way that does NOT vibe with the rest of the restaurant. It's as if the architect, interior designer, executive chef, bar and wait staff are all on one page - a page that is classy, well executed, and delicious - and the owner walked around and hung up some tactless pics to demonstrate HIS views about a women's role in the world.",

    "text": "Wow! This place was wonderful. My husband found the Fat Ox, which was near our resort, on yelp and made a reservation on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating our Anniversary. We went on a Monday evening, so it was not super busy. I love italian food, especially anywhere that serves homemade pasta. The entire restaurant space was beautiful, very classy. We were seated on the lovely patio. The view isn't much, but it's far enough off the street that you can't hear any of the traffic noise. The server mentioned our anniversary and brought us some complimentary Prosecco, which was very thoughtful. I wish I could remember our server's name, because she was absolutely wonderful. She steered us in the right direction for each course selection. We started with the mozzarella burratta, which was simple but fresh and delicious. We then moved on to the pasta course, where we couldn't decide, so again she helped us choose the Garganelli and Lamb rigatoni. They were perfectly portioned and absolutely delicious. We could have probably just kept eating pasta, but we also ordered the scallops to share. This was a good decision because we were quite full by this point. The scallops were perfectly cooked with great flavor. Our server offered a complimentary dessert, but we ordered more drinks instead as we were much too full for dessert. I ordered an espresso martini, which definitely hit the spot. Overall, this was a wonderful meal and we will certainly be back the next time we are in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came here for our engagement anniversary and everything was wonderful. We made a reservation for a Wednesday night and spent about two hours enjoying nearly everything on the menu. The ricotta appetizer, the veal meatballs, the duck sausage pasta, the crab ravioli, the scallops, the salmon, the panna cotta, and the lemon tart - everything was fabulous and the grapefruit basil martini was one of the best drinks I've ever had (strong but sour and delicious.) If my review was based on only my first visit, I'd be giving 5 stars, but averaging out my first and second experience, I am hesitant to give even three stars. My fiance and I came back for happy hour today and felt mostly ignored by the bartender. With three people behind the bar, it's hard to understand why we would not be tended to at a barely half full bar. To start off with, the bartender gave me the wrong wine. I asked for a Sauvignon Blanc and was delivered a Chardonnay. When I asked him if it was a Sauvignon Blanc or a Chardonnay he flat out told me it was a Chardonnay because he couldn't remember which I had ordered and basically just guessed. We ordered the beef tartare, the duck sausage pasta (again), the lamb rigatoni and the veal meatballs. Again, all the food was amazing, but the service was severely lacking. We arrived about an hour before happy hour ended, and wanted to get our food in before then but were ignored for so much of our visit it became irritating. Even when our bartender passed us, it was only to deliver a drink to another guest and he barely even made eye contact. My fiance ordered a gin and juice to start and wanted a second one, but had to flag our bartender down in order to get it in for happy hour, and I couldn't even get his attention to order the same drink a few minutes later, so I ordered from a different bartender.  Not once were we asked if we needed anything else or if we wanted refills as our drinks were getting low towards the end of happy hour. We felt very unimportant. It was clear that the regulars were getting better service as our bartender spent much more time with a clear regular who ordered one beer, which was comped, than he did with us as we racked up a decent bill. The final problem was with my grapefruit basil martini. The only way I can describe it is warm vodka with a basil leaf placed on top. I instantly knew it was wrong as it was not the delicious drink I had enjoyed the first time we visited. This drink was made by a different bartender, who I have assume was new based on what she served me. Again, it took quite a long time to get our bartenders attention (he was talking to another staff member at the other end of the bar, with his back turned to us and all the other patrons) so we could tell him about the problem. When he finally came over I showed him the drink and even he said it looked completely wrong, and he remade it. This was the second problem with one of my drinks and I never spoke to a manager even for an apology. The second martini was much better, and I definitely enjoyed it, but the whole experience was lame. Our bartender dropped off our check before we asked for it as well, before I had ordered my last drink. He quickly put the drink in and gave us a new check, not asking if we wanted anything else. Our bill was already over $100 at this point, I don't understand why he didn't try to sell dessert, or at least wait for me to enjoy my last drink to see if my fiance or I wanted another. We wanted dessert, but being pushed out that way turned us off from staying any longer. Overall our second experience was not impressive and I am extremely happy it was not our first time because I'm not sure the food could have made up for the service if we had not been there before. Fat Ox as we know it has wonderful food, reasonable prices, strong and delicious drinks and great service, but this time was an overall failure. We will try it again, but will be hoping for much more attentive service.",

Everything about the food was spot on; we loved the flavors and how everything was cooked. No complaints at all about the food! The service on the other hard was difficult to understand. Our waiter seemed disengaged and did not really seem to understand what we wanted from him as a server. He continued to talk about the dishes that we did not have questions about and would interrupt at very odd times. I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars because the food was delicious, but the service needs some work. If I could recommend anything, I would say: wait until the guests ask questions before providing suggestions and always ask for drink orders before giving the overview of the food. Overall, it was a good experience, but not great.",

Ayla (bartender) was our server and she could not have been any better. Knowledgeable, responsive and had excellent recommendations. We had several different options the- burrata with the pork belly wow outstanding- not super fatty just super meaty. Had a few of the hh pastas - tortellini was best bite of the night in my opinion. My husband had the brick chicken it was delicious!!!! Moist with lots of cool things that you could add - aioli, hot sauce etc. We also had the gigli which my mom loved, and the skirt steak. We were all highly impressed with the restaurant and couldn't say enough about our food and service. I would come back just for Ayla..... but now we know the food is amazing also!!! Thanks for impressing some tough diners!",

Right away, the manager/host Darvay (probably butchered the name, sorry!) greeted my boyfriend and I at the door by name, ready to take us to our table. We were seated at a pleasant corner table in the back. Our server Canton was amazing. He knew the menu inside & out, as well as drinks & wine. We started off with two tequila/mezcal cocktails & then asked him about switching to a bottle of wine. He recommended a very nice 2005 red blend called Arcanum. We ordered the burrata & the prosciutto to start, then had the ricotta pasta with rabbit tenderloin which was incredible. We then had the 18oz ribeye, the half Jidori chicken with polenta(amazing), & the short rib alla vaccinara(something like that). We ended the evening with two shots of Avion tequila & dessert! We had the tiramisu which had a chocolate mousse like chocolate base, on the side was an espresso ice cream & these chocolate crunchy balls on the side. We also tried the pistachio Gelato which was so good and I'm not very into pistachio ice cream. Every dish was super unique & delicious. My two favorites were the pasta & the short rib. The restaurant itself is beautiful & I will be back. Not your typical italian restaurant...in my opinion it is much much better. Go try it out & request Canton!! He will make your experience amazing!",

The menu also has multiple courses and if you order according to how it's designed, will take you through multiple courses. Portion sizes vary greatly but a single dinner entree is large enough to get full. Service was pretty good. Our waitress walked us through the experience and did a great job explaining the menu. Food itself was good as well, but it is a little pricey, and I didn't feel that it was distinct enough to pay what we did. They do have a large cocktail and wine menu as well.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. We tried 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 main courses and 2 desserts and we probably really only liked 3 of the 8 dishes we paid for. That's not a great ratio for a $200+ bill. (For the record the dishes we liked were the Caesar salad, tiramisu, and olive oil cake. Not really worth that high of a price to only like an appetizer and 2 desserts. Oh and the olive oil cake is TINY FYI) We also ordered a few things that were either the most popular, or the waitresses favorites...  We were seated immediately and we only called ahead by 45 minutes. We liked our waitress and the staff seemed helpful. It was busy and our waitress disappeared for awhile, but overall was very helpful and attentive. Be mindful that they charge for water.   Personally I'd probably give them another shot bc I am pregnant and didn't get to try different varieties of raw food, but I'm pretty sure my husband wouldn't go back. He is a great cook himself and really the problems weren't that the dishes were awful, it's just that each one lacked something to make it truly flavorful. They looked beautiful and tasted \"ok.\" I could easily list out each meal we had and why it wasn't that great, (even small things like salt...) but I'll spare you. But I think trying 8 dishes is definitely giving a restaurant a fair shot before leaving a review.  For us personally, we should have spent $200+ on groceries and had a nice meal at home. (For the record... we aren't cheap.., But if a meal cost $45 then it should taste that way. What I tasted, honestly, shouldn't have been more than $20 a plate) But if you've got money to burn, aren't really a \"foodie\" and just want to try different restaurants in the area, then go for it!  After reading other reviews I see that this is the same chef as The Mission, which I enjoy. We should have just gone there;)",

For example, without advance guidance, we learned that kohlrabi was essentially cannelloni beans with minimal greens and $110 steak meant to serve three was gristly and modest in size. Server assured us she'd alert kitchen, yet we received no feedback.   Upon completion of ordering meal courses, staff presence was sparse.   Tiramisu was to have been accompanied by coffee gelato that seemed more like a crystalline iced coffee.  A part of me craves one more try, but I'm not sure what might merit the effort.",

The portions are tiny and I haven't found anything that's really memorable / \"craveable\". The caesar might be one of the best things and it's nothing special (plus it's lettuce).  The burrata is literally 2 teaspoons of cheese floating in a bowl, really strange presentation and absolutely ridiculous portion. The casoncelli pasta is actually really good but it is 6-7 pieces of pasta lined up on a plate.  Entrees were really expensive for what you get and none of the meat or the salmon that I've tasted has been memorable. Disappointing.",

    "text": "Chef Matt Carter and front-man Brian Raab have knocked it out of the park...again. These are the guys who brought us The Mission (including the new location in Kierland), The House Brasserie, and had a hand in Zinc Bistro as well.  These guys are at the absolute top of their culinary and hospitality games, and it shows the second you walk in any one of their doors, where you will be greeted by professional, friendly, and efficient hosts/hostesses, and then served well-crafted cuisine by True professionals who are knowledgeable and passionate about the food and drink they are serving, prepared and plated by a kitchen brigade that puts out consistently delicious and impeccably presented fare.  Fat Ox is a successful attempt by this team to exceed their already exceptional standards, and it is fine dining at its best: upscale without feeling overwrought; mesmerizing without being ostentatious; and satisfying to every sense and every sense of the word.  The cuisine is inspired by Italian classics, with a modern twist, and includes vegetarian, pasta, beef, poultry, and seafood entrees, along with a substantial offering of charcuterie, cheese, salads, and other lighter plates perfect for small meals and/or sharing as part of a more extensive dining experience. A nice dessert selection is also available, along with coffees and after-dinner liquers. There are also a number of interesting and tasty hand-pressed cocktails to choose from, including some interesting combinations that really work well.  The extensive wine list is fabulous, presented by an experienced sommelier who can guide everyone from the occasional wine-sipping novice to the more experienced wine enthusiast, with equal aplomb (in our case, it was \"Stephen\", who set the table up with a wine flight to go with each course, including a palate-awakening rose in the salad and cheese course, a couple of reds of varying fullness and profile with the pasta plate and entree, and a sweet lambrusco to finish it off).  Highly-recommended for anyone who loves creative food well-prepared, in a setting with an energetic vibe, served by professional and efficient staff.",

Busy to capacity, staff was on point in every regard, knowledgeable, their in house sommelier came over to greet us, as well as management. We left the order entirely up to the waiter, and boy did he wow us. I couldn't name the foods we tried because there were so many, but it's safe to say the most memorable were definitely the Steamed Mussels, the Agnolotti and Garganelli. We finished off with a couple of their 28oz Dry Aged Prime Porterhouse, which was undoubtedly the best I've ever had. Wow. And then, just when we thought we were full up, they bring out this extraordinary Bronte Pistachio Gelato that was to die for. I could have indeed died that night and been utterly satisfied. We will be back, matter of fact, maybe even tonight! Cheers.",

The balance of the menu is fantastic as well. Salads served table side. Deserts and entrees never disappoint. Service is exceptional.  They are attentive, but not bothersome. The environment is lively, but not overly loud. A great place to introduce anyone who has never been to Fat Ox. I have out of town guests frequently that request another visit to Fat Ox. I will be visiting again soon. Thanks Fat Ox for the exceptional experiences.",

But we warned, this is not your Mom's typical Italian home cooking.  Don't go here if your looking for old fashion spaghetti !  This is Modern Italian Cuisine and is it good!  Very complex flavors and textures.  Interesting restaurant design but I would imagine the volume would get pretty cranked up when the place is packed.  Looked like an up scale crowd even during the non-snowbird season.  Service was great, Thanks Canton, and all the staff was very friendly - everyone wished us a good night as we left as if they all served us.    Great food, nice staff - what else could you want ?",

We were seated promptly and the waiter did the usual walk-through on appetizers, specials & featured items.  He took drink orders and (except for one person), all the drinks came right out.  Then we had our apps and placed our entree orders.  After more than an hour - with no check backs, explanations or comments from our waiter - I finally snagged the manager and asked where our food was.  It took them about 2 minutes to bring out all the entrees then, which tells me that they were prepped and sitting under a light in the kitchen.  The next aggravation was that we had to ask multiple times to get all the sides that we had ordered.  After all of our questions, we were comped on dessert, which was appreciated.  In all the 3+ hour experience was not worth the inflated prices.  We will not return there.",

Must try the side of roasted cauliflower. We finished the meal with a decadent Tiramisu accompanied by expresso gelato. After all that our server Canton made recommendations for our next visit and to our surprise brought out a serving of homemade pistachio gelato for us to try.

Thoughtful, helpful, yet not overbearing.  AJ's recommendations were also spot on - including how much food to order.  Second, the atmosphere was gorgeous, sophisticated yet comfortable.  We could hear each other! Finally, the food was freaking delicious. We had the table side prepared Caesar (no raw eggs), which I loved because they used butter lettuces and didn't overdo the dressing.  We also tried the avocado and buffaletta with grilled avocado - I really liked the avocado and added it to my Caesar.  The others loved the cheese (never my favorite anywhere).  Then we tried two pastas - my favorite was the tortellini.  OMG the pasta was cooked perfectly and the inside was creamy and delicious.  I had the meatballs for my final dish (the others had scallops).  Those meatballs (3) nestled in the creamiest, most amazing polenta I have ever tasted we're ... I am running out of superlatives! ... magnificent.  We tried the tiramisu, lemon tart and chocolate tart.  All were very good - consensus being lemon tart was the best.  Very fresh, perfectly balanced sweet and tart.  I cannot wait to go back.  One of the girls is going back Sunday!",

    "text": "We made a reservation at Fat Ox for our anniversary and had a delightful time.   The service was top notch all night long. They even gave us two complimentary glasses of prosecco and a card thanking us for celebrating with them. Our server was great and the manager seemed thoughtful and like he genuinely cared that we were having a good time.   We came hungry on purpose. We started off with the ricotta appetizer. First of all, we were questioning how you even get ricotta this good. Do they have to make a special trip to heaven? Just curious.   So, the ricotta is *whipped* with lemon zest, honey, and the nectar of the gods and then topped with marinated slivers of trumpet mushrooms, herbs, magic, and wrapped with prosciutto with some hidden flecks of hazelnuts. I mean. yes please. The only thing is, it would have been nice to have more bread to go with it all. But eating ricotta with a fork is fine too, I'm not judging.   Next up: Crab ravioli. These bite-sized pockets of love were accompanied by charred corn crumbles and some kind of sweet tomato(?) compote and lots of cute little sauces and radish slivers and pea tendrils or something. Order it, ignore the price tag. Indulge!   For our entrees, I chose the scallops and my date ordered the filet. Scallops are great because they're mysteriously buttery and tender and just ridiculous. They're such a luscious treat that I actually narrowed down my dinner location choices by restaurants that have scallops as entrees. So, three delicate and perfect scallops were sliced in half and served atop a pillow of sun choke puree (of which I entirely cleaned the plate), showered in brussels sprout leaves and marinated mushrooms, and I was in ecstasy.   I only had one bite of the filet, and the porcini mushroom sauce was on point. We ordered a side of the roasted mushrooms - which were delish - but had I known that they would be the same as the mushrooms with the scallops, I would've preferred something else. Their flavor is just a bit too bright to have a lot of all at once - I was expecting more of an earthy mushroom experience.   All in all, Fat Ox was wonderful and treated us super well for our anniversary!",

The food is outstanding. Simply put. They also served me the best grapefruit cocktail I've ever had, and I've had many!   I had the burrata which was AMAZING. The veal meatballs which are tiny, but so worth the flavor! Also best tiramisu - it's very very unique, like the majority of the menu. They do everything differently here and it works amazingly!",

I had the filet which was cooked as requested with a very tasty mushroom sauce. My wife had the scallops which she said were awesome. We stated with the veal meatballs. I'd suggest you do the same if you go. Even the table bread was delicious! It is a pricy night out but we expected that and weren't disappointed with overall value. My only con was that we are brown liquor folks and found the pricing structure around some of the whiskeys and scotch head scratchers. $25 for Oban 14? Doesn't make sense, and not the only oddity. The Ox overall a keeper. Give it a try on for your next \"nice\" dinner date.",

We stumbled upon Fat Ox & what a great find! It's Saturday night & only tables available were on the heated patio. Great!!  The food was amazing & maybe one of the best Caesar salads ever!! Prepared table side by Cody & it was delish!! We each order one of the seafood options; grilled Salmon, Scallops  or Swordfish. We all were pleased w/ our selections.  I got the Swordfish & was so tasty, Seasoned w/ peppers, onions & sausage. Very nice!   The Dirty Martini  was divine, & kudos to the bartender! But it should be @ $20 per! What? I've never paid $20 for a martini! The hostess, Cheyenne was personable & aiming to please. Such a sweetheart & helpful too.   My Boo ordered 2 desserts, Tiramisu & Affagato. We had 4 spoons, a friend had joined us for dessert. I love Tiramisu but this was different than any I've tasted. It was too sweet & sticky. I'm use to creamy & smooth. The Affagato, think Italian float, ice cream & espresso, was super.    The other criticism was our waiter Anthony who lacked follow thru. We saw Cody more. I had to ask another waiter for a cocktail.  We still left a 20% tip.",

    "text": "We had an interesting dinner at Fat Ox the other night...  The rave reviews and accolades brought us in.  Our server was terrific, very personable and helpful in ordering as he steered me to what he thought I would like best on the menu based on my preferences.   I'm not sure what steak I had for my main but it was delicious as was the mussels starter with a scrumptious tomato broth. Most of our table seemed quite satisfied with their meals with the exception of one dish. A pasta selection that was supposed to have truffles on it, possibly as an add on.  When the tray of our mains came out to the table the person delivering the food turned around and went back in the kitchen.  It was a bit of time and then they returned.  After tasting the pasta, my friend, who is a chef and owner of a catering business, asked where the truffles were on her dish.  The server apologized and said that the dish had dropped coming out of the kitchen and that was the last of the truffles that they had.  They offered to bring some truffle oil/butter on the side and did.  For this caliber of restaurant, that was unacceptable to me.  We were having a great time and enjoying the company at our table and just let it go.  However, I feel the restaurant should have 1. Offered her to select an alternate dish before they served the table, or 2. Most certainly should have let her know before she had to ask and also comped her entree.    On their behalf, they may have given us some dessert gratis, however, if it was, we were never told and I believe some of our party ordered from the restaurant week menu anyway which would have included dessert.  With a party of 6 and 3 bottles of wine, things got a bit hazy by the end of the meal!  Nevertheless, overall the food was very good and the service - aside from our mishap - was exceptional.",

When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Canteen R was our excellent server, explaining all the new and existing dishes being offered.  We started off with cocktails: a Cosmo which was excellent and Martinis. We chose to dine off the AZ Restaurant week menu choosing the Tagliatelle, Scallop Crudo, Jidori Chicken, Skirt Steak, ending with the Pistachio Gelato and the Panna Cotta. There was a mix up in drinks and we were offered the Cauliflower side and a comped Cosmo.  The food was wonderful, excellent Tagliatelle and Scallops. The Chicken came with this tangy hot sauce... so good. The skirt steak done to my ordered medium rare. I will say I am not a fan of the new cauliflower trend, but the comped dish made me try and OMG I'm a lover now. The Pistachio Gelato was excellent. The weakest dish was my Panna Cotta dessert.  Great dining experience, I'm glad I tried on the  AZ Restaurant Week. A bit pricey especially cocktails, but it won't deter me from coming back though.

I worked with two event managers (Tamara and Heather) and two servers, and everyone was experienced and top of their game.   We had a 30-minute reception followed by dinner. The event manager met guests at the restaurant entrance and led them to the private dining room, where a server handed them a glass of Prosecco sparkling wine. There were also passed appetizers, and a wine and water station (with a server) with Prosecco and our red and white wines. I'd asked them to have the first (appetizer) course on the tables when people are seated, so they brought that out at our dinner start time, which was a good transition for people to move to the tables. Everything went so smoothly and the staff had perfect timing and professional demeanor.   I did not stay for dinner but I've been to the restaurant a few times and the food is really good. :) I heard good feedback that everyone enjoyed the business dinner.",

I dined here recently with a large group and we were fortunate enough to have the back private room reserved for our dinner. The wine was a-plenty and flowing upon arrival! I felt bad for the staff because initially we came in all at once (just about) and they seemed a little overwhelmed. Drinks from the bar took a little while but I don't blame them because a) the size of our group b) it was happy hour/dinner time.   The pre-selected white wine was delicious and paired well with our family-style meal. Appetizers included the house cauliflower (to die for!), insalata di casa, and an amazing charcuterie board. Our main course plates were gigli, short rib, scallops, and chicken, of which the scallops and chicken I think were the best-liked in our group and for myself. The polenta was so delicious that they brought more bowls of it. There were other sides, but not as memorable. We had a chef's selection for dessert and I'm glad I picked the panna cotta - you cannot go wrong with that at an Italian-inspired restaurant.   My hat's off to the chef for creating an inspiring menu and for the team at Fat Ox for a great evening!",

Slower service than expected, couldn't believe a 7:00 reservation for restaurant week had us finally leaving at after 9:30. Table side Caesar salad - great idea however we were asked if we were ok with several ingredients that were not even in the salad. Where was the cheese, garlic, pepper? Disappointment. It was very hard to converse at our table, the volume inside was so loud. Drinks took ages, the place was not that busy. All in all, there are better places that are cheaper that offer much better service.",

    "text": "After a long decision making process, my party decided to attend Fat Ox for Restaurant Week Spring 17. I mean, this is a big deal for us: we all consider ourselves foodies and are 'well-eaten' haha. Anyway, we arrived promptly for our reservation excited to try out the menu we had previously perused.  Immediately upon entering the door we got the impression from the hostesses that we were putting them out. The hostess at the desk looked me up and down, without a smile on her face, and gave a simple \"Hello\". I did not feel welcome at all though proceeded to give her the details of our reservation.  We received a similar reception by our waiter, particularly once we told him that we were there for Restaurant Week. After this, we were told they were out of the Hangar Steak, which several members of our 8 person party had already decided upon. They were not offering any substitutions for this item. I began to feel regretful about this choice of restaurant, especially since I had pushed for Fat Ox and made the reservation myself. For the remainder of the evening, service from the waiter was very slow. The waiter assistant, however, was actually very kind and on top of things.       On to the food. I ordered the Cavatelli as my appetizer. This was good except for the pieces of hen that were a bit chewy/grissly. The corn was a nice, sweet foil to the saltier pasta. The Jidori chicken was the star of the show, very flavorful and tender. The accompanying polenta was very creamy, and I appreciated the addition of the side sauces. I tried a friend's sea bass and was underwhelmed, as there was not much flavor. I had the affogato for dessert, which was yummy, though more like espresso with a lot of thick whipped cream on top than a traditional affogato. It was served with a side doughnut dipped in a very rich dark chocolate.   Bottom Line: Even though the food was tasty, it did not make up for the way we were treated. Many restaurants, on RW and otherwise, have much better offerings for similar prices with much better service. We will not be back. Two stars.",

    "text": "Have been in town visiting from Chicago for two different bachelorettes. For the first, I recommended it after hearing about the 25 Layer lasagna! We had a large group, about 13 and overall felt food, service and ambiance were all great. That said, I recommended it once again to the next bachelorette group that I was returning with two weeks later. We showed up on time for our 8P reservation but were not seated until about 8:40. Our group was fine to sit outside and have a cocktail (which were on point btw!) while we waited for the table.. as a server, I get that you can't hustle out a large party even if you want to! When we got to the table, we were greeted with flutes of champagne which was a nice touch given that we are all there celebrating and the table was running behind. Honestly, all was pretty great- loved the chicken we shared and the charcuterie board and the wine we had (I want to say Juggernaut but not positive?).  However- the only thing that kind of soured the experience was at the end... we paid our $450 dollar bill, left a generous tip and then as we're about to leave the waiter comes up and said he forgot to charge us for our wine and that he needs to reswipe my card. obviously, we ordered said bottle, we weren't trying to skimp out on not paying but if you are not attentive and observant enough to your checks that you are leaving off a $65 dollar item- that is on you to eat. As i said, I'm a server and have been there before and it would be an unfortunate thing I would have to cough up because it's my mistake which is what I feel should have been the case. All of us felt it was a little weird to have to reswipe my card/retip but in general, did love the food and experience and would go back if I were in town again.",

    "text": "First and foremost, the service blew me away. Our waiter literally gave us a tour of the kitchens/dining areas and had the menu memorized to a tee. He later prepared the most delicious Caesar salad right in front of us.   The modern Italian style of the restaurant promotes a small dish, mix & match concept, meaning that the four of us ordered several dishes (2 pastas and 2 meats), from which we took food to our individual plates. As a little shrimp in a big world, that freedom to experiment and try everything really appealed to me. Not only that, but the food tasted incredible!!   When dessert time rolled around, my friend Bartholomew began saying that this may be the greatest meal he's ever had. Our waiter then brought us a trio of his favorite desserts, of which the tiramisu was breathtaking. I'm a tiramisu fanatic, and I kid you not that it was the best I've ever had. (The waiter didn't even charge us for one of the desserts, and his startling kindness makes me think that he's a beautiful merman of sorts.)   Bottom line: If you want to splurge and try something different, swim over to the Fat Ox and have a mouthwatering time.  Tl; dr: The tiramisu saved me from this cold, harsh world and taught me to live to my fullest potential.",

The owner even threw in a bottle of champagne for us! If that's not treating you guests right, I don't know what is. Finally, the food.

    "text": "I was introduced to the Fat Ox last night for the 2017 NYE celebration with a lovely prix fixe menu.   Our reservation was for 7pm - early enough in the evening to relax through each course and savor our food. And that we did for the first 3!   We were ushered in warmly, like family, and seated in a back dining room, which had a nice, intimate feeling.  From the prix fixe menu, I selected the table side Caesar salad, green tortellini, the Creekside filet, and the Meyer lemon tart.  The Caesar salad is made to order at your table, and they take into consideration all your preferences - if you're squirrelly about raw eggs, don't want anchovies, etc. My salad was perfect - the lettuce was crisp, dressing was tangy yet not overpowering, and dressed perfectly.   The tortellini, too, was flavorful. The pasta was al dente, ricotta filling creamy but not watery, and the presentation was beautiful - colorful & tempting.  My filet was cooked just as I'd requested - medium. It was tender and juicy. The porcini cream and gravy enhanced the flavored of the meat nicely. Everyone was happy with their main courses, except one if us, who ordered the short ribs. (She felt that although the seasoning and glaze was flavorful, the meat was rubbery - it wouldn't cut.) Our other friend, who ordered the guinea hen, loved her meal.  I liked the ambiance as a whole. Up to our receiving our main plates, our service was lovely - the delivery of our food was timed perfectly, the waitstaff attentive but not intrusive, etc. All the accoutrements made for a lovely experience - flatware had a nice weight, lighting felt warm & inviting, there are a lot of airy & open spaces, and the decor a blend of old & new.  As we were savoring our main courses, the live band began their first set. It seemed out of nowhere that the volume in the back dining room exploded - it was simply too loud. My table mates & I couldn't hear those sitting next to us in conversation, and there was no option to speak to anyone across the table, as the volume was too loud. We had to repeat ourselves in conversation constantly (none of us have hearing issues.)  After five or so songs, the lead singer began belting out Jennifer Hudson-like notes, which unfortunately weren't delivered as Jennifer Hudson would.  Nevertheless, the music could've been digestible had it simply been lower in volume.  Sadly, the music volume shifted the tone on our entire dining experience. After serving the first 3 courses and being perfectly attentive, our server went missing. It became apparent why - although we'd preordered our desserts at 7:30, they'd somehow sold out. Three of us ordered the Meyer lemon tarts (evidently most people eating last night did!), one ordered the olive oil cake, and the last ordered the tiramisu.  I assume our server didn't know how to mitigate the issue, thus opted to ignore us until we asked where our desserts were. Finally the olive oil cake and tiramisu were delivered, but with extra random, small bowls of gelato. As she delivered these desserts, our server did not acknowledge our missing tarts, thus we sat there looking at the gelato in confusion and disinterest. The three of us who'd pre-ordered the tarts finally flagged another server down (ours went missing again,) to inquire the status of our promised desserts.   So, as we sat perplexed in the status of our tarts, those who received the cake & tiramisu shared theirs.  The tiramisu was very good - the person in our party who ordered it, loved it. The olive oil cake was dense. The taste and texture reminded me more of a bread than a cake. It was served with orange gelato, which helped offset the density, while also add some much needed flavor. I think I'd have liked the olive oil cake if it had been made with citrus peel. But without such a pop of flavor, the cake to me, tasted too bland.  We were also promised an Amaro in the prix fixe menu, which didn't come until we inquired about its status.   In the end, the gelato sat almost untouched - I tasted them just to test the flavors. There was pistachio, espresso, and amaretto. Pistachio is my favorite gelato, but this one had a faint, almost indistinguishable pistachio flavor, which is a shame. The amaretto, too, wasn't strong, but the espresso was very distinguishable. The gelato was definitely rich & creamy, but alas, I'm not a fan of gelato in the wintertime.  So, the latter half of the evening felt as though we were micromanaging the delivery of an agreed-to contract and being placated with boring alternatives. That's unfortunate, because the first half of the dinner was delightfully phenomenal.  We chalked the negative experiences up to their being a new restaurant, and not yet having worked out their kinks. The bad news is that what went wrong, was handled sophomorically. But the great news is that they got half the evening more than right. And in the end, I'll go back for that Caesar alone.",

    "text": "So where do I begin, disappointment doesn't fully describe our experience. We were a party of four.  The waiter explained that the portions weren't \"overly large\", he was somewhat correct but he should have said they were absurdly small. I don't often leave a restaurant hungry and thinking where can I stop on the way home for a quick bite.   The waiter explained that we should share the meals, but order a number of courses, which is what we did.     We started with a Ceasar Salad, it was very good but small in size , our second course was an order of Barrata cheese, which also was very tasty.  Our third course was pasta, we ordered a Cavatelli with chicken, there was barely two tablespoons of past.  Absurd,  I believe it was $18 and was supposed to be a main course and was barely an appetizer size.  Our fourth course was Flank Steak., $35,  they first brought out steak knives that you could use to butcher the ox with, and then out came the steak. Eight or so thin strips of steak,  I mean thin, it would have been laughable if I wasn't paying for it.   The atmosphere was very nice, and all the dishes were very tasty and well done.  The place was packed tonight but my guess is that they'll be out of business in six months. No Ox got fat eating here.",

We were still waiting for a couple of girls to arrive from the airport, we never felt rushed.  We ended up closing the place down.   We started with table side Caesar salad. Loved it.  Fresh and that dressing so yummy! And who doesn't enjoy table side service.   For dinner I shared 2 types of pasta with one of the other ladies.  We tried the garganille pasta and resso crest di gallo.  Both tasted fantastic.  Daily house made pasta was perfectly made and the sauce was not overly powering.  The garganille was my fave, it was a light cream sauce.  Being in a group of 7 you get to try other food that people ordered.  I had a bite of the swordfish, was delish!  Made me wish I ordered it.  Veal meatball was on the dry side, overall ok.  And the affettati misti, so rich!! That my friend ended up getting a lighter entree.   Overall, we had a great time, service and food! We would go back if we were back in Scottsdale.",

My friend and I made a reservation via OpentTable for 7:30PM on a Saturday night. The only option was for counter seating, but I had placed a request for an actual table if possible. When we checked in with the hostesses they acknowledged our request and said we could have an actual table.   The restaurant was slammed, but the timeliness of everything was perfect. Our server was amazing and timed each interaction perfectly. I wish I could remember her name! She was very refined and we could tell she had been a server for quite some time.   She recommended this homemade pasta appetizer to us which was AMAZING. It melted in my mouth and the flavor was perfect. I would go back just for that! Then I had a steak and my friend had salmon. Everything was perfect. I have no complaints whatsoever.  The ambience is very cool with dark lighting and candles. It's definitely underrated and I 100% recommend giving them a try.",

I agree with other reviewers that the serving sizes were just right - not too large, but not laughably small. I was thoroughly impressed by the bar where I ordered a Oak Barrel Aged Manhattan (very good) to start the evening off. For dinner I had the scallops - definitely would recommend.  My only complain, which is small, is that the restaurant was very loud. At a table of four, only one of us were able to hear our evidently soft-spoken waitress, so much so that we opted to have one person order all of our appetizers for us because we couldn't hear the explanation of the menu - at all. I actually had a hard time hearing the hostess too. I might not go back here for a work dinner again for this reason.",

    "text": "Ewww...I'm not impressed at all.  The yelp page says they open at 4:30pm so shortly after I arrived with a small group only to be told to sit at the bar only because the restaurant wouldn't be opening for at least 30 minutes.  Okay but one friend had a small child and therefore couldn't sit in the bar so we sat in our cars waiting 30 minutes.  This was dumb and we should've left but we wanted pasta so we stayed.  The waiter was trying waaayyy too hard to impress and as soon as he walked away another server was much friendly easier to communicate with and suggested some dishes.  Our waiter returned and took our order.  Based on yelp photos I went with the table side Caesar and a cheese dish and the grilled shrimp.  Umm the salad was okay but nothing special, the grilled shrimp was ice cold and not that great either, and the cheese came as a small salad - wtf?!  Okay onto entrees we all wanted pasta and selected a few to try.  My friend went ahead and also got the scallops.  All in all the pasta again was \"okay\" and nothing special. The final bill was $400 for 6 adults who had the apps listed above and pasta and only two had a cocktail...wow what a joke. $400 for mediocre food that's trying to hard.  The sad thing is I heard about this restaurant from the Andaz who also shows a tv commercial on the welcome channel showing the amazing pasta...no idea where the disconnect is but having experienced Pasta around the world and some of the most amazing Michelin star pasta dishes this place is a waste of money.  Honestly Olive Garden would have been more filling, faster service, better overall and for a fraction of the price.  It's rare when I regret the entire meal, calories, money, etc.",

This is a good Happy Hour and date spot as the noise level is relatively low and lighting and atmosphere was nice.  I'm Celiac and need gluten-free options free from cross-contamination & they were very accommodating. We both got the Gigli pasta as a pasta starter (mine was gluten-fee penne), and both really liked the flavor as it had good tomato and basil flavor to it.    For dinner I went with the short rib and was quite good with the side of polenta.  The pomegranate molasses sauce they put on the short rib had a lot of flavor. My wife got the chicken and it was very good. Both meals with gluten-free (if you remove the tortilla from the chicken plate).  The hot sauce that came with the chicken was very good! It was relatively hot and have a good peppery flavor to it.  We both had dessert as well. I had the pistachio gelato without the crumble and it was phenomenal, highly recommend it!  My wife got the chocolate tart and was happy with. She said you needed to be in the mood for something chocolatey but if you are, this would be a good choice.  We'll be back again likely on another date night!",

My boyfriend and I got a few dishes and shared them so we could try multiple things.  The table side Caesar salad is amazing, I definitely recommend getting this it is like no other. We also got the veal meatballs, half chicken, tortellini pasta & steak with mushrooms. All were outstanding and I would highly recommend all however I'm positive everything on the menu is delicious.   The real reason I'm writing this review is because of the service. I am from out of state and do not have my I.D flipped so they were unable to serve me a drink , completely understandable. Most places would say sorry and continue the service ,  but not here. The manager along with our servers Scott and Anthoney were very apologetic and even served me a non alcoholic cocktail to make up for it, they then put in a pasta dish that was one of their favorites which is now our favorite and brought out a dessert for us at the end. The service was amazing and it truly made our night how attentive they were to us and how personable the manager is.  If they do see this review we want to say thank you for a great dinner service! We will continue to choose Fat Ox for all of our special dates because the food is unreal and the service is there to match it.",

    "text": "Maybe I am just on an Italian food kick, but recently I have been lucky enough to visit a couple of the greatest Italian food restaurants in the Valley.  I had driven by the Fat Ox plenty of times before, before, but I had never stopped inside.  Fortunately, this Friday night I was hungry, with my family, and the restaurant had an open table: we decided to step inside.  Now we did not know what to expect from the food, other than that it was a spin on Italian food. I would consider it a more modern take on Italian food. Not modern in a \"weird food combination way\" but modern in a \"here is a spicy and seasoned olive oil\" kind of way. I started with the Caesar for two made at the table. The crispiness of the lettuce paired well with the taste of anchovy and the parmesan created a wonderful taste.   I couldn't decide between the steak or the 25-layer lasagna (you read that right, 25!).  I decided to go for the lasagna, how could I not?  Interesting enough, it is not an Instagram-bait portion. It's a very reasonably sized slice that is laid down on its side and covered in roasted broccoli. The lasagna had a sweet and savory flavor to it, not Grandma's lasagna, but delicious in its own right.  Now my only criticism of the entire restaurant was that the broccoli used as garnish was roasted directly over a gas stove and just had a tinge of gas taste in it. Not enough to mar the rest of the meal, but definitely noticeable.  The dessert was delicious; I would definitely recommend the tiramisu as you can never go wrong with a good tiramisu at an Italian restaurant. The lemon cake was also incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day, but it was incredibly tart, so make sure you are ready!",

Fat Ox was recommended by our concierge and I could not recommend it to everyone in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area enough. When making reservations you can choose between a high top (bar area) or tabletop (dining area). We chose the bar area with the wonderful window wall. And the food. Oh the food. Unique and classic Italian all at the same time. The food will knock your socks off! The cesar salad was one of the best I've had- perfectly salty and cheesy and tangy. I opted for the anchovies but you can order without. The charcuterie tray was well balanced with a little of everything you want in your meats and cheeses. The pasta was fresh and you can tell. I picture a sweet Italian grandma making it in the back and apparently it's not far from the truth! I tend to order and affogato after a delicious meal and this was no exception. But it's an affogato with a side of donut hole. Yeah. It was a lot.",

They were both very good (tiramisu was better if you're going to pick just one). Wine selection is great and service was super attentive, just a little too quick for us. They brought our main dishes before we were quite finished with appetizer... that was the only issue that kept it from 5 stars (we felt rushed).",

Staff is extremely friendly and nice.  My wife kept her hand bag on the floor and one of the staff promptly ran over with a towel to put under it.  The food was great. They are known for their table side Caesar salad which was amazing. The shrimp and mussels were amazing as well. The pasta which we got to share was delicious. For the entree I got the rib eye which was tender and delicious.  We were too stuffed and did not try the dessert.  This is a great place for a nice dinner. Do plan on spending money when your here.",

    "text": "This Italian spot woes in every way. We picked this restaurant to kick off our vacation here in Scottsdale and to celebrate my birthday. The decor and airy digs really strike a nice chord-fantastic food and service with just the right amount of casual elegance.   We had a two man team of servers who were probably the best servers we have ever had anywhere. They were personable and so obliging... attentive, yet not overbearing. We started with a bottle of Barbaresco. Very good. Their mainly Italian sourced wine list is really nice and well priced. But if you need your fix of the big bold overpriced California cabs, they're there too!   I opted out of the appetizer course to save room for the entree and dessert. But our server must have overheard me remarking how delicious the fresh pastas we and he sent over a small portion of the green tortellini. Wow. Perfectly al dente pockets of yumminess. The flavors were so bright and this starter is incredibly delicate. My husband had the linguini which was also cooked to perfection with a creamy tomato sauce that was to die for.   And right before our entrees arrived, another surprise... the garganelle pasta with duck sausage that I had said I needed to try. I must tell you I never eat pasta in the United States-well almost never... all 3 fresh preparations could go head to head with any of Mario Batali's. Totally worth the splurge and extra hours in the gym.   The scallop entree was beautiful, and the flavors really sang but the mollusks themselves were a bit small and probably should have been cooked 20 seconds less. The Jidori Chicken was supple and juicy. It tasted good but was a bit uninspired. The salmon entree and cauliflower sides ordered by our friends looked good but didn't get rave reviews.   To top off our evening, the server sent out a medley of desserts (we could not decide) and he presented a tray with an olive oil cake, pistachio gelato, affogato and a crazy good sugar donut filled with the an airy hazelnut cream. What a finish to a spectacular meal.   Between the service, the wine list, the pasta and the dessert this modern Italian restaurant surely garners 4 stars. With a few adjustments I could easily award 5 and I will definitely come back to do just that. Thank you Fat Ox for a wonderful meal.   Returned here for another birthday celebration with my husband. It remains one of my fave places in the area. The service is attentive and on point. The wine expert gave us a bottle that was spectacular and newly curated for their ever changing wine list. The Bibb lettuce salad was bright and the dill just shined beautifully.    The rosso crest di Gallo seasonal pasta with red wine and duck sausage is heaven on a plate. They actually cook the pasta in red wine, not water! Totally inspired  cuisine! The scallops and swordfish were both excellent and the Calabrian cauliflower side very yummy.  Too full to order dessert, they did send over a gorgeous Panna cotta with carrot foam and sweet crumbled bits of cake. Stunning presentation and equally delicious even if the custard type dessert isn't your cup of tea.   Can't wait to come back again next year! Thank you Fat Ox. Do you think you can open one in northern NJ?!",

They were quite welcoming and I was pleased with their professionalism as they promptly offered me an excellent table on the patio.  All Fat Ox staff were A Team members!  I thoroughly enjoyed the Caesar Salad made tableside (see photo) - yes I ate both servings and I'm not ashamed.  It's the best caesar I've ever eaten.  Buy it now!  Next I moved onto the Affettati Misti (see photo).  Oh the colors, flavors, and textures of the bread, butter, cheese, fig jam, meats, and olives.  Mark's wine pairings were spot on, he's one of the most knowledgable sommeliers I've met.  For my final course I had the Gigli pasta (see photo).  The housemade noodles were like delicate flowers coated with a deeply flavorful tomato sauce unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I could go on and on about individual ingredients and flavors but instead I'll spare you the details and simply say that my dining experience bordered on emotional.  What an epic restaurant.",

    "text": "Tried Fat Ox during Spring Restaurant Week. We made reservations for a Sunday evening via Open Table. Got 2 text reminders.  Hostess was warm and welcoming; we were a few minutes early, so we sat at the bar -- interesting  and unique drink list. Friendly bartender.  Dinner service was well paced, helpful and pleasant. I think we had a team of 3 working our table. I had the house salad to start, and it was one of the best, most interesting side salads I've ever eaten -- spring greens, frizzled prosciutto, walnuts, blue cheese, pomegranate. Delicious! DH had the veal meatballs and really liked them. For dinner, I had the jidori chicken. It was perfectly cooked and large enough for 2 meals. It comes with a flatbread, caramelized onions and greens. They serve a couple of sauces on the side. DH had the skirt steak w/pan seared mushrooms and onions. He loved it! Serving size was \"appropriate\" --. Not too much food.  He ended with  tiramisu, which featured roasted banana and Nutella. I snagged a bite. Very sweet but a nice riff on the classic. I had lemon Panna cotta w/raspberry sauce. It was thinner than I expected but I enjoyed it. Both desserts were petite sizes, perfect ending to our meal.  They have an Italian-heavy wine list w/very few choices under $100/bottle. We had a Barolo that was $75 and quite nice.  I want to come back to try their pasta dishes. All in All, a very enjoyable evening, both because of the food and the service. I'd go back!",

My first annoyance was, we were a party of 4 with a 5th coming to join us for a drink later in the evening. There were 2 corner tables for parties of 5 and we asked if we could take one of those and were told they were reserved. I waited all night to see if that was True and it was not!! We had to squeeze ourselves in to a small table for 4.  We had several of the cheese platters, the caesars, which was ridicoulously small even for 1 person, several of the pastas and the porterhouse steak with the several sides, one being the polenta, which was dry and the other being overly cooked mushrooms.  The best things on the menu are definetly the pastas, the waiter did say they were house made.  We had 2 bottles of wine and the sommelier was extremly personable. My biggest complaint about this restaurant was our waiter. He was extremely pushy, we really only wanted a couple of things from each course and he was beyond insistent that was not going ot be ok. after getting our first course very quickly he came over once again and asked us if we were ready to put in our order for more food. We said we would put our order in for our 2nd course and if we could have some time eo decide on the next courses. He said no I really need to take it all now. Since we were not quite ready, he stood over our table while we contemplated a good 5-7 minutes on what we wanted. SUPER ANNOYING!!!  We were visinting from Los Angeles, I will definetly not go back, however I hope for the sake of such a beautiful location, they will make it work.",

    "text": "EXPENSIVE! This is a new restaurant in town so I guess they do deserve the buzz? The decor is nice and modern. They served modern Italian food with smaller portions and bigger price tags than some of the other restaurants.   The food was good but not sure if they are worth the price tags. They do try to convince you to order at least 3 courses (4 with desserts) because they are tapas styles and meant to be shared.   $15 for table side Caesar salad - it was good and can be served with anchovies and fried capers.  Ravioli was $15 and it came in 5-6 small pieces.   Black squid pasta $18 - one of the better dishes they have.   6 oz filet $45 was served with potato side dish. The cheapest meat on the menu. They have another cut of meat for $110!   Scallops $35 and it came with 4 pieces. Not worth it in my personal opinion. I had way better scallops in other restaurants.  Tiramisu $8 - it was a small sliver of tiramisu. Decent but nothing spectacular.   Anyways, prepare to spend at least $100/person.",

The bathroom is lovely old school tiles, smells serene (seriously) and has a solid soundtrack thumping. The food was the star - everything was excellent : - Cheese and Meat plate: fresh and interesting  - Veal meatballs - light and flavorful - Pastas - AMAZING and made in house they were unique and really good - Whole chicken - fantastic with grey smiley flavor and hot sauce - Porter House - butter yummyness   The service was very friendly and knowledgeable - especially with wine recommendations and the choices are great - especially a great wine of the glass list. That said it does take time for the service to ramp up and so there are some inconsistent wait times. Overall - great spot!",

    "text": "My main reason behind giving this place 2 stars is because the prices were sky rocket high for a tiny tapa size portions of food. My husband and I went to this restaurant recently to celebrate our 2 year anniversary, and mind you, we love wine and italian food. We have traveled all of Italy multiple times, and we were so excited to try Fat OX.   The service was absolutely bar none. We were seated in a bright area of the restaurant, and when we went, it was not busy at all. There was maybe 3 other dinner parties in the place, so we cannot speak to the place being loud. It was actually a nice atmosphere. The waitress placed my purse on a napkin on the floor, and was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  We decided to order an appetizer a pasta and a fish. While the food was excellently prepared and tasted well, we left so hungry. The wine was over priced for what it was (greater than $15 a glass). We left with a bill over $200 for the two of us.   They need to give you better portion sizes. Even in all of Europe, where portion sizes are smaller than USA, you get more stuff for your money... We likely will not return. For $200 price, we suggest you drive up to Sassi for a sunset view, gorgeous place, amazing food, and great sizes. If we were to compare a restaurant on a busy street in a strip mall to Sassi in North Scottsdale, we would tell you to go to Sassi.   This place has great potential. But they are a little overboard w pricing and not enough food to equal out the pricing. Wonderful staff, delicious food, mediocre wine.",

They sat us at a table that was so close to tables on either side we could hear their entire conversation. The table was so small we had to rearrange it every time we got a plate. This is definitely not a romantic place to be. Definitely should not charge the prices that they charge for food with what I have mentioned above. Wine is expensive compared with other restaurants in their category.",

If you really aren't a foodie and just want a nice social atmosphere with loud music and middle aged scottsdale scene than you will probably like this place.  I had the mussels which were fishy tasting and full of tomato soup broth, pasta with lamb and pesto which was not bad but didn't have the fresh pesto taste at all and way too much salt and then the scallops.  Scallops were rubbery and tasteless.  Just not good food.  Good Luck!",

Our server on the first visit was Ryan and he was so knowledgeable and friendly as always,  we have been following him for years.  Ryan gave us a tour of the kitchens/dining areas which has never happened to us before. He recommended a Brunello which was spectacular. The concept is fabulous gives everyone a taste of all that they have to offer. Caesar salad table side? Are you kidding me, don't miss it. Quite a difficult task to decide what to order but based on all of Ryan's suggestions, we were quite happy and quite full by the end of the meal. The garganelli is not to miss, skirt steak another not to miss, the scallops delish. Great for a group, great for just two.",

One minor critique - on the charcuterie board, I wish they could find a substitute for ham.  Eating San Danielle prosciutto along side of ham is like having a filet minion and skirt steak on the same plate. Overall, you can't go wrong with this place.",

    "text": "My mom and I tried this place for restaurant week last week. First impression was that it's a got a nice vibe with mid-century modern decor. The hostess was nice and saw our reservation and seated us quickly. It was early so they weren't busy which was nice. They didn't ask if we wanted the restaurant week menu right away but when we finally saw our server we asked him for it and he obliged. The menu looks good but is definitely geared more towards the meats and not as heavy on pasta which I thought was strange since it's a modern Italian place. We picked out what to try on the restaurant week menu and ordered. The wait staff at first seemed very distant and too good to talk. But the manager on duty was very nice and answered questions we had, stopped by to check on us was just pleasant to talk to. But still we didn't feel like we really fit in which was unfortunate. When the food started coming though, the flavors just burst in your mouth. It was all amazing starting with the bread you get when you sit down to the meal. Only one drawback was that the skirt steak wasn't done right. I wanted it medium, figuring it'd be closer to medium rare but it came out barely rare on half of it. The taste was still amazing but some was just too rare to eat. The deserts were ok, nothing o wrote home about. The table next to us got a salad and it was made in front of them which looked amazing. And they have a great wine and drink list. Just wish they were a little more welcoming and the steak was on point. Definitely want to try it again since some restaurants just aren't the same during restaurant week.",

The sommelier could have provided more options than just the single suggestion but, I must say, the suggestion was quite good.  The food was delicious. The pastas were exquisitely prepared, especially the casoncelli that was flavorful and almost desert-like. The skirt steak was excellent and the salmon was perfectly cooked. We weren't a fan of the cheesecake gelato but the pistachio gelato was scrumptious.  Many will be disappointed in the portion size or claim pricing is high. We didn't find it hugely out-of-line though. We do suggest they stock Bailey's Irish Creme at the bar...especially for a chilly winter evening. Indoors is very loud.  We'll be back.",

The butternut squash ravioli is amazing and the garganelli is INCREDIBLE. Definitely do it family style, course by course. We started with the mussels and chefs meat board (ask for extra prosciutto, you won't be sorry), then chose 3-4 pastas, then the bistecca which comes with a mashed cheesy polenta. The wine list is great and the service is impeccable. Can't go wrong with any cocktail (although I wish they served the Old Fashioned with one block ice cube, it watered down quickly). The portions are small because it's meant to be served together with other options family style. If you order one of the pasta dishes only and expect to be full, you'll be disappointed - but you'll also be doing it wrong. It's not cheap, but it is more than worth it!! Expect to be rolled out - fat and happy.",

We started with the table side Caesar salad, followed by mussels and shared the whole brick chicken.   Your given bread upon ordering and I have to say it was some of the best bread I've had.    You only get one piece per person which is probably a good idea because if there were more, I wouldn't have eaten every last piece.    The Salad was delicious and the presentation was fun.   The homemade Parmesan crisps were the only thing we didn't care for.  They were a little to hard and not amazing.  The muddled were bursting with flavor and the sauce was so good, we keep the bowl to dip our chicken in.   I could eat that sauce with about anything!   Organic brick chicken exceeded our expectations and was juice, flavorful and just the right amount of crisp on the skin.    The portion was so big we barely finished half of it and believe me, we wanted to eat all of it.    The service was outstanding as well. You are taken care of by a team and checked on regularly.  Super friendly staff and they have additional staff also helping out.  These are the lovely gals walking around, each with a different scarf tied around her neck and s black dress.   They reminded us of flight attendants in the cutest way.    It was also our anniversary so our waiter brought us out a delicious desert that we of course ate every last bite making it a perfect date night.    Can't want to come back here again.",

In a nutshell, the food was tasty, portions on the small side (for the price), and the service just plain bad.    We were seated promptly and menus were place on the table. But it took a while for someone to come over and take our drink orders.   Finally our waiter came over and said \"I am seeing about some regulars so it will take a while\".  And, it did.  Eventually he gave us a very quick run down of the menu and then went to hover over the regulars' table.  We finally got our drinks, ordered, and the food came out.  Our waiter's helper did come over as we were finishing up, and while pouring water, asked if everything was okay.  Our waiter never came back to check on us until dinner was finished.  And he didn't ask about our meal.     Bottom line:  we like Fox restaurants but we won't come back to this one.  We were expecting a first class experience and were sorely disappointed.   If you go, and get seated near a table of \"regulars\", get up and leave.  You will not enjoy your meal.  By the way, it is a bit loud but we can deal with that.  And, they are a little stingy with the bread.....",

The bar and restaurant decor is great and truly invite you in to have a cocktail or glass of wine. The staff is amazing. Super nice and super attentive. But that's where it ends.   The menu is innovative to be sure but, unfortunately Fat Ox fails on execution. The table side ceaser was so salty it was painful. And we knew it was coming, when adding capers, anchovies and a ceaser base to a bowl...there is no reason to add salt. But they did...and it was brutally bad.   The pastas. The crab ravioli had so much potential but there were four tiny little raviolis on a plate with so much other cr*p that it totally took away from the actual crab. On the upside, the tomato jam, smashed peas, cheese and who knows what else was on the plate was actually good. The duck pasta was good. Nice portion size, right amount of spice and rich duck flavor. I would recommend.  The filet entree with potatoes was average with the exception of the mushroom cream sauce that was exceptional. The scallops, a bit undercooked, and just okay.  We skipped dessert.",

Atmosphere is alive and upbeat, but NO privacy. Seats are VERY close!  Listened to the conversation of table next to us all night. Next time I would try the pasta.  I will stick to drinks and appetizers at the bar.   But all and all I love this place. Good people good fun good vibe  At bar :)",

They claim it's tapas style restaurant but their prices are way too expensive for tapas. Their Caesar salad cart doesn't make since to me. What's so special for making Caesar salad I front of our table. I would rather go to ocean club instead. Disappointed.   Went there a week a go. Amazing drinks as well as food. Great service . I guess they got it right after all.",

    "text": "The other night I went to Fat Ox for the first time and my oh my was I impressed! The concept is modern, yet so classic at the same time. I have to admit, I was a little uneasy about trying this place... But thanks to their stellar staff, my visit could not have been better. The idea here is to break up your meal into five courses. If you miss this key point, your experience will certainly lack. With that being said, the prices on this menu can add up fast if you don't share with those at your table. My friends and I chose to share with the table for the starting courses and \"buddy up\" with one other for the entree portion of the meal.  Many told us we HAD to try the table side caesar salad - so that's exactly what we did. The gentleman making it for us had suggested that we don't take the anchovies out like we requested. We went out on a limb with this one and we were all so glad that we did! It was ah-mazing! Next, we ordered the bellwether farms ricotta board for the table... Truly an excellent choice. Being a HUGE fan of all foods involving butternut squash, I made sure to continue our dining experience by ordering the casoncelli pasta dish. It was sweet, light, and super tasty! Like I said before, we all agreed to \"buddy up\" when it came to choosing our entrees. My friend and I shared the short rib dish which came with broccolini and an addicting special sauce on top. I knew after the first bite that I had found one of my new favorite restaurants... It was THAT good.  I truly cannot wait to come back to Fat Ox and explore their menu further. My biggest advice if it is your first time going - keep an open mind the entire night! Many things on the menu may intimidate you, but don't let that happen or you'll miss out on the unique dishes this place has to offer. And last but not least, if you are unsure, ask the staff questions! Our server and wait staff was SO friendly and willing to talk about our wants and concerns!",

The hype did not live up to the experience. The service was pretty good, our server was friendly and explained the menu well, but there were long waits at times. Presentation of the table side Cesar was impressive but tasted generic.  We asked to be reseated after getting a table next to the service station. When we asked if we could sit at the two open tables around us, we were rudely told they were specifically reserved. We were seated on the patio which ended up being wonderful because it was a nice night. However, there was no light outside so we could not see what we were eating.   Overall, we were underwhelmed with the experience as a whole and will not recommend this restaurant.",

I ordered the Duroc Pork Tomahawk - very tender and full of flavor, not to mention a cool dish to look at. The beans that came with it were even better!  While not traditionally Italian, overall, if you're looking for a good, upscale restaurant and want to try something new, this is a good place. On the other hand, there's nothing terribly special about it that would make you want to come back again.",

The menu is supposed to be more family style and that's what we did (party of 5). The table side Caesar salad is a must. Best Caesar salad I've ever had, super authentic. Five of us split two. We skipped the anti pasta section and went straight to the pastas. They are all Mde by hand in house and to die for. We got two recommended by the waitress and split them. We each had an entree. I had the scallops which were divine and a great size. We also got two sides for the table. Then we each got a desert. All 5 deserts were so good and unique but my favorite was the chocolate tart. French press finished off the amazing meal! At first, the portions we got for 5 of the salad and pasta felt small but it was perfect after you ate each course and we weren't sick to our stomachs full. The wait staff was amazing! Lizette was so sweet and gave great recommendations. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "This is the first time I have written a negative review. I am not one to complain often, but this restaurant warrants this review for so many different reasons.   To summarizes our experience in one word: disappointing. I took my mom here because she loves Zinc Bistro, by the same chef Matt Carter. This restaurant looked and sounded so amazing, branding itself as \"modern Italian\".   As soon as we walked in the door, we really wanted to like it. It's modern fixtures and buzzing atmosphere seemed promising. However, our table was late and the hostesses were visibly disorganized and loudly discussing issues they were having. Our table was strangely placed near a party so large, we had to move tables in the restaurant during our first course just to hear each other across the table.  Sadly, the worst part was the food. We got the mussel antipasta (recommended), the burrata, the Rosso crest di Gallo (pasta) and the rigatoni lamb verde. The mussels were immensely over salted, not fresh at all and the sauce had such a high amount of acid it overpowered anything else in the dish. The burrata was severely under salted, with no vehicle on which to eat it, it was a strange dish. Both the pastas were extremely salty, high in fat and way over cooked. The rigatoni had pickles in it which was very strange.   To sum up the atmosphere and food: trying too hard, overdone, confusing.  Our one saving grace was our server Mary, who was nice enough to take our pastas off our bill, and did so with genuine sincerity.   I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, even though it sounds so good. The overall execution of service, food and organization left much to be desired and did not deliver what we expected at all.",

Each one was delicate, flavorful, fresh and just overall outstanding. Each dish was beautifully presented and delicious even if I didn't know what half of the ingredients were. You literally cannot go wrong.  We started with house bread served with fresh ricotta, tried 5 pasta dishes, enjoyed the porterhouse steak, and topped it off with the chocolate tart. All the recommendations from our excellent waiters were so helpful and every bite was delicious. We flew home to Boston with full bellies and were literally in awe with our dining experience.

Headed into this dinner, I thought we had made the right decision, but we walked away pretty disappointed.   Our waiter informed us that he and another waiter would be sharing our table. Great idea as it'll help move things along especially on a busy night. Sadly this didn't turn out to be the case.   We started off our dinner with the table-side Caesar and Garganelli (truffle butter pasta). Really strong start, attentive service and everything was trending in the right direction.   After this our main course order of Waygu Beef (on special) along with the Diver Scallops took almost an hour to come out and our waiters (x2) were no where to be found. On top of this when the main courses finally arrived, they were just warm, not even hot and extremely underwhelming for how much everything ended up being.   With high hopes of a spectacular meal at Fat OX, we walked away pretty disappointed.",

    "text": "This place is phenomenal literally more restaurants should model themselves after this spot.   The vibe is right whether you are meeting a person or two at the hightops by the bar, dining with a large group in the backroom, on front or back garden patio or in the main dining room.   Our booth was half blue leather and half denim, so edgy and comfy. Our wait staff team was pleasant and fairly attentive.   Hats off to the table side Caesar salad maker, it's the most incredible salad I've ever had. Literally you cannot come to this restaurant and not order this. It's an absolute .    Next up, the hand made in house pastas. There is a good variety of shapes, sizes, and flavors for you to order from with and or without meats. I was hesitant with the speck in mine  the Gargelli which  was a truffle butter taste. You could feel the ridges on your tounge with every bite and the perfect parmesan droppings.   My dining partner ordered the squid ink pasta with shrimp. Seafood was fresh with a nice taste that didn't overpower the pasta but complimented it nicely.   The ribeye was delicious. Definitely would go back.",

The service had some lapses initially but finished out quite well, staff was always polite and professional but for the first 10 minutes or so some members of our party were getting ignored it seemed.  The food and wine made up for it.  Salty perhaps, as Italian food seems to be, but delicious.  Melt in your mouth steak, soft chewy mushrooms, salty truffle butter pasta, bread, too much.. my eyes were bigger than my stomach and liver and paid the price for that, but that tells you how good things are tasting when you nibble your way to wheelbarrow stuffed.  Also 4 out of 5 because where we were seated it was super super loud, near the bar and loud speakers.  I would request a better table in the future outside or anywhere else.  Also, it's super dark in there so you can't see what you're eating, and with good food I like to see the texture and oil and everything, reading bottles, etc. it was dark.",

There was so much variety in the menu, our diverse group all found something to love.  Great drinks and wine.  The ribeye and chicken were great.  Amazingly, people loved the cauliflower!  If you can invent cauliflower that people love, that says a lot.  None of the dishes were filler items, casually prepared.  Each dish made a statement and the whole set and sequence of presentation was flawlessly executed.  It's not a cheap place, but high value.",

This was my first time going, so decided to stay and give it a try.  The food was very disappointing, DeFalco's or Maggianos is a way better option (which is sad considering the price point).  The wine wasn't served at proper temp either..  The only positive was our waitress was very nice and attentive (only reason I'm giving more than 1 star).

    "text": "I am finally getting around to writing my first Scottsdale restaurant review since becoming a snow bird down here in February.  While there are many, many great places to eat in this area, I was amazed at how awesome the service and food were at Fat Ox.  The menu is set up in the traditional Italian format of Antipasti, primi piatti (pasta course) and secondi. Though there were so many terrific looking options (I will have to go back), I am a sucker for table side Cesare Salad preparation and the one here is no exception.  I highly recommend you get it, especially with the anchovies.  (They are mashed up and provide a fantastic sea salt taste to the dressing).  The pasta was incredible and we ordered the Gigli.  Our dinner guests ordered the Linguini and that looked great too but alas, I was not offered a taste as they finished it so fast! The best part of the meal was the Brick Grilled Chicken.  Wow!  So good and flavorful!  It came with their house made hot sauce in a small bottle and since I did not use all of it, our server graciously allowed me to take it home.  Can't wait to use it on my eggs for breakfast! The wine list had an expansive Italian selection and I got a kick out of the fact that the California wines were listed under the \"International\" selections - truly an Italian centric menu!  We got the Gary Farrell Pinot Noir and it was sublime. Fat Ox is a great dinner place at a higher price point than most but totally worth it.",

It seemed as if there was no management for the wait staff. Our waiter never came to our table, and had someone training with him (bad example to set). We received the bottle of wine after the appetizers (we ordered the wine before the food). The table side caesar is nothing special, and the famous meatballs were barely warm and didn't have enough sauce. They did remove the meatballs off the bill after I mentioned this. The most entertaining part of the night is when a waiter asked if they could take away an extra chair at our table that my bag was on. I said it was fine, and they proceeded to lay a napkin on the floor for me to put my bag? It was very odd. I guess my expectations were too high coming from NYC for Fat Ox.",

When it came to the main meal the server did a great job of explaining each item and making recommendations. However he didn't do a really great job of explaining how tiny the pasta dishes were. Do not think you can go and have pasta for a meal. One dish had like 7 pieces of bow tie pasta. I am not joking. They intend for the meal to be several courses so it's tiny portions. I got the braided lamb and it was delicious. The dessert was the olive oil cake and it was really good. So overall I would definitely recommend.",

Thank God our waiter, who clearly was even out of his element with this mediocre at best food, asked his comrade about a wine selection. The one saving grace-. . The ricotta tasted like straight Mayonnaise and don't even get me started on the frozen pimento loaf served with the bread as an opening nee amuse bouche. Olive Garden has better flavor. This Fat Ox has none. And no I don't like to get hit over the head with flavor at all times. But something for the money would be great. Will never set foot in there again.

    "text": "While I wasn't able to enjoy the full course sets due to my daughter getting tired, we really enjoyed the veal meatballs, fingerling potatoes and mozzarella da buffala for the appetizers. My picky eater of a son enjoyed an entire helping of Gigli as well as my mother while my wife and I enjoyed the Ricotta Cavatelli as well as some Gigli. Both amazingly delicious along with the appetizers. Then we had to skip to dessert which was 3 Tiramisu and one pistachio gelato that my son was over the moon for and wanted to know why this was so much better than regular ice cream. If you have the time for an amazing course dinner and seeking Italian. This is the place.",

    "text": "Dined here for Restaurant Week, Spring 2017.  Gigli - fresh pasta, but nothing special. There isn't anything wrong with simple, but the flavors in this dish did not really stand out. This seemed like fresh pasta with canned sauce.  Mushroom 'Pasta' - the flavors did not settle into the mushrooms. Overall, bland.  Tiramisu - solid flavors  Sangria was too plain, martini was very strong (which was of course, absolutely fine). Veal meatballs were juicy, but were not very flavorful  Out of the whole experience, I enjoyed the polenta and tiramisu the most.  Two star food experience, Five star service experience.",

    "text": "I will start with the good. Great location! Nice architecture and interior design. Great service and tasty food.   Now for the bad...it's so loud in the restaurant you literally cannot hear yourself think, let alone hear the people you are dining with! Our poor waitress had to yell at us to explain the menu and to tell us her favorites.    I don't speak Italian so I didn't know what the menu meant.    English please!  The food was very good, but way over priced for the serving size. $17.00 for a table side Caesar salad that fit on half of a salad plate? They said it was for two- I'm a girl and could have eaten the entire thing! Pasta dishes to share starting at $15.00 with no meat...? And we were told all their dishes are for sharing? If you shared the dish person could have one bite.    Loved the family sharing concept, but for those prices the dishes should be almost doubled in size.   I wanted to love this place- and it came so close in so many areas...but the noise was a deal breaker for me!! If you want good Italian with a fun vibe- Try Mora!!!",

His attempts at upselling were gratuitous. Food was poor all around for our entire table...from quality to taste to portions. When we discussed our concerns with the waiter we were simply met with contempt. Fat Ox is grossly overpriced for the food and experience  and I will not return.",

It was like he was having us over for dinner at his own house! This meal would be my last if I only had one left to eat. Drink water has founded a local treasure for all to enjoy. I felt like absolute royalty and you will too if you eat here. Please. Please. Please. I you want to feel like kings and queens then you need to eat at the Fat Ox. Wow. Wow. Wow.",
