    "text": "I don't have any pics because I eat it really fast!... What I liked the best about this place is that it's like going to a taco stand in Mexico. They serve you the taco plain (meat & tortilla) then you grab any toppings from the side bar ( guacamole, cilantro, onion, key lime and different salsas from mild to hot) you can buy one taco or as many as you want, they don't restrict you with set combo plates. Obviously they don't have beans and rice because it's not a Mexican restaurant, as it's advertised for what they serve \"TACO PLACE\" so I won't give a bad review for something that it's not part of the menu.. The flavor of the meat was just right for me, the tortilla tasted like the yellow corn tortilla from Mexico. Having open bar to the Guacamole was a PLUS for me, I only had the tacos but will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu. The price was very reasonable, food size portion was good, loved the salad bar, I would encourage them to get spicy carrots for variety sides. The place inside it's bigger than expected, and they DO have regular height tables in the middle and tall pub tables around the windows so pick what fits you the best. Over all Great place to have a quick bite if you're only a lil hungry or for the Big guys with big appetite, you won't go broke with this prices.",

Where they fell short was where they skimped on the amount(a Very Small tablespoon) of meat on both types of tacos but especially on the al pastor! I understand they are street style tacos and aren't very big to begin with but I've had some really healthy street tacos in town,  these were pretty weak! I wouldn't have complained had they costed 99c but $1.75 a piece!!! I for one never hesitate  paying for a meal whatever the price, if it's worth what they are charging. Come on Tacos Calafia! Put some meat in them tacos! There are other places in town I would recommend for a good street taco..",

Corn tortillas tasted fresh and were warm and soft, just like they should be. Quesadilla even had some cheese grilled on outside, nice touch. Got a large horchata which is a cinnamon rice drink, delicious, just the right sweetness for my taste. Then I loaded up at the salsa bar: 4 different salsas, green tomatillo was my fav, red had some bite but not too much, didn't try the other two red sauces. Guacamole sauce, limes, cilantro, and onions to top off your items, couldn't go wrong.   Chose this place due to high reviews, glad I did. Check in using the Yelp app to get a free taco, easy.

    "text": "A great taco spot for anyone craving an authentic Mexican taco. Came here after a Spring Training baseball game. Tacos Calafia did not disappoint. They have $1.75 street tacos that are outstanding. Almost feels like stealing they are so good. Another taco that are \"to die for\" is the Vampiro. Very much like a tostada. A crispy tortilla that is topped with cilantro, onions, meat and guacamole. Again, an outstanding taco. Ordering from the friendly staff. My friends and I, on vacation from San Diego, ordered our tacos to go. Back at our hotel room. No one talked much. Just the sounds of guys eating tacos. You know the food is good when everyone is truly enjoying their meal and no one is really talking. Yes, that good. Support local business especially the good ones. I am jealous I am out of towner. I would eat here every week. Tacos Calafia is a excellent taco spot. If not one of the best I have ever ate. Eat tacos here.",

    "text": "TACOS TUESDAY, EVERYDAY!!!! Thank me later... Come check out Tacos Califa if you want some flavor, some good vibes, and maybe a beer or three. We ordered tacos, a Vampiro(tostada) but no beans, and a quesadilla. All were El pastor and Carneasada as they were out of pollo. The el pastor was amazing, and the Carneasada was on point. I've never personally had a Vampiro before hence why I ordered it. Another reason was I was told it's double meat! DOUBLE! This was awesome, very crispy and flavorful along with the fish and house chile . Now the tacos are made with what seemed and tasted like homemade corn tortillas (not confirmed) but very delicious. If you've never had el pastor please do me a favor and just try one taco, your free taco when you check in...thank me now",

TACOS CALAFIA offers Tijuana style tacos at a reasonable price and again with a customer service that excels. The meats are pastor (pork and my favorite!!), asada and chicken in either tacos, mulitas quesadillas or nachos... yes, nachos!! And for those that are on a Paleo diet, they offer a bowl-like with your meat of choice, a delicious guacamole and some veggies.   Now, for quenching your thirst, they offer soda, water, JAMAICA and HORCHATA. Perfect combos :D You can't go wrong with that!   THIS PLACE IS A MUST!

    "text": "So this is a very unique review. I havent seen anyone else really speak on this...So I dont know if this was an isolated case, or there are other people out there that this has happened to. So here it goes.... My son, daughter in law & 2 yr old granddaughter went on a Monday, when they have All You Can Eat Tacos for $14.99. They place their order for 2 people All U Can Eat, 2 beers & asked if they can order 1 taco A la Carte for their 2 yr old. And the young girl working the register said No, you have to pay 14.99. (Who in the world is going to pay 14.99 for a 2 yr old to eat ONE taco??)  So my son told her \"No, I just want ONE taco for her.\" And the girl said \"You HAVE TO pay 14.99 then or she cant sit with you guys at your table.\"  My son asked to speak to a MGR and he came and explained the situation. And the MGR said they could have the All U Can Eat tacos, but the daughter could not have any of their tacos. And my son said \"that is fine, I will buy 1 taco a la carte.\" And the mgr said she would have to sit seperate, so they can keep track of whos participating in the All U Can Eat special.  ***Who in their right mind is going to allow a 2 yr old to sit by themselves?? People are trafficking kids, abusing kids, raping kids and they want my 2 yr old granddaughter to sit alone. NOT!!! My daughter in law expressed her concerns as a mother, that she was NOT sitting seperate from them. After some more exchanged words, the Mgr agreed to allow their 2 yr old sit with them. But he was going to be watching them. (Like their in prison or something WTH) On top of that, the girl forgot to give them their beer and when my son went up for them, she gave them attitude and he told her he just wanted his beer he paid for, that she forgot to give them.  I was going there every other week, and I have not been back since this has happened. Which was about 2 months ago. I know, its been a while, but I have a life. But also thought this would be informative for some people wanting to have dinner with their children.   **Tacos Caliafa, Shame on you and your mgmt, cashiers!!!  This world is full of sick people, out there stealing children and selling them on the blackmarket and you want your \"customer\" to sit at different tables than their 2 yr old children. Figure another way to keep track, or how bout sell them a pinche taco a la carte!! No wonder you always have posts & signs looking to hire new employees, you have terrible people working for you, representing you, and wearing your name. No bueno con este familia!!!",

The chips are too expensive and so basic... the amount is too small for $2.25.   Overall, this place is overrated and the quality is barely average...",

Like who can complain (unless you don't like beer) the wait wasn't long at all and they had a bar for you to put your toppings in your tacos. The tacos were DELICIOUS!!! We had a pollo, carne Asada and pastor. Our fav was the pastor! Definitely coming back.",

I wanted to give it a 3 1/2 star... they have great service, corn tortillas are freshly made, they have a salsa bar with cilantro, onion, limes, it's a really nice restaurant in a nice area but they're not the best tacos. We have tried so many taco places and there's one that no one can beat so far and that's tacos Ta'carbon on 59th and camelback. It's in the hood but those tacos are the best we've had and that's a 5 star, not trying to bring them down but the tacos here are lacking flavor and the al pastor are just ok....trust me.  For some real tacos you gotta take a drive in the hood lol.... the salsa is ok too, for some really good tacos the salsa has to have a great flavor, I drove a long way to come here and I was a little disappointed bc the reviews are way overrated",

I wish there were some chips that I could take to eat with their yummy guacamole, I always have some leftover after tacos are done and hate throwing it away. I don't know the deals off the top of my head but they have good deals on certain days of the week. Tortillas are corn and flour and both are homemade. They give a generous amount of meat in each taco. I always get full after 5 or 6. The carne asada meat is also very flavorful. You can tell they season it and marinate very well. The chicken is also very flavorful and super tender. I get the chicken for my toddler since it's so easy for him to eat. He loves it and loves to dip it in the guacamole.",

Don't sell them if cooking corn is to much of a problem.  Tacos were good but sometimes when you get to popular you skip on other places.

Tacos are a simple dish but are often messed up. It has been my experience that either the meat is bland and over cooked or the tortillas are sub par.  That is not the case here. The Asada is tender, seasoned perfectly and full of flavor.  The tortillas are fresh, warm and compliment the meat nicely.  The salsa bar is fully loaded with toppings allowing you to truly create the tacos just the way you like them with guacamole, cilantro, onion, fresh lime, green and red sauces.  BEWARE....the HOT salsa here is no joke!!!!  Top off your meal and cleanse your palate with an ice cold cerveza or \"Mexican\" bottled soda, fountain drink and enjoy the night out on the large patio area.  Do yourself a favor and pay this spot a visit, form your own opinion. If you do, be sure to check in on Yelp and claim your free taco!",

    "text": "West siders familiar with famed food truck Tacos Tijuana will likely walk into Tacos Calafia feeling like the menu here is an echo of the Tijuana food truck.  And indeed owner Adolfo Torres Jr operated Tacos Tijuana before branching out and opening this brick and mortar.  I was unaware of this before stopping in, but a Phoenix New Times article on the wall of the restaurant pointed out this fact.  This gave me supreme confidence I'd made the right choice coming here on a Friday during lunch.  You'll find Calafia on the northeast corner of 83rd Avenue and Thunderbird.  You can't miss the place once you're in the parking lot.  There's no fancy signage, just a giant TACOS banner hanging out front.  Walk inside, order at the main counter and they call your number at the pickup window when its ready.  A lengthy salsa bar is right up front to decorate your food as you please and the seating inside is mostly no frills folding chairs and plastic tables with a few high tables mixed in.  Altogether I'd guess they can pack in 60 or so at once.  And today they damn near did.  Firefighters, contractors, construction workers, and suits were all in line ordering up big group portions for dining in and to go.  Fortunately the line moves fairly quick.  In addition to tacos, they offer quesadillas, nachos, vampiros, and mulitas.  But today I elected to keep it simple and order 4 tacos on corn tortillas.  Each taco containing one of their four meat offerings:  Carne Asada (steak), Al Pastor (pork), Pollo (chicken), and Cabeza (beef cheek).  Also got a small horchata.  And yes, they honor the free taco Yelp check-in.   Total cost for everything including tax and the free check-in came to a very budget friendly $8.  I dressed my tacos at the salsa bar with some cilantro, onion, guac, and a hint of salsa verde.  The carne asada and pollo were perfect with just the perfect amount of char and seasoning.  The cabeza was a new one for me, but I really liked it.  Tasted like eating a tender beef short rib in taco form.  The al pastor on the other hand?  A little disappointing.  The flavor was okay, but honestly when I bit into the taco it was oil overload.  The Al Pastor I had at Tacos Tijuana were amazing so I know Adolfo and his crew know how to make these right, so I'm guessing today the sauce was just a misfire.  Better luck next time on those (I hope).  All things considered, I can't knock Calafia for the prices or the quality of their meats.  And dining in a comfortably air conditioned space has almost certainly paid off for Adolfo's business when dining al fresco in the middle of summer is less than ideal.  So good on him for getting a permanent space to call his own.  Next time I'll dive deeper into his other Mexican staples (especially the Mulitas).  Super prices, super simple menu, (mostly) super food.  Proof that if you do the simple things right, you'll get a line of loyal fans dozens deep like there was today.",

Like the carne asada could be marinated more & some more spices added to the guacamole sauce. At a $2.00/taco price you can't complain much, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Maybe some will disagree cause the place was busy at 9PM.",

It was a little confusing with their set up but it took me a good minute to figure it out. You basically order your food at the counter and once they call for your order, then you go over to what they call \"salsa bar\" and start adding your guacamole, onions, pico, salsa sauces, and etc.. I thought the meat was very average. I had better tacos where they add everything for you but I do like the idea of having a salsa bar. The meat was a little bland to me so I added a pinch of salt to each tacos. Guacamole literally taste like avocado and it's more thick consistently. I like my guacamole more on the watery side with flavors like garlic and such. I wouldn't say they are terrible because it's definitely busy. I'm willing to try more items on the menu and explore the salsa bar more. Service was very nice so I'll definitely be back to try different food they offer.",

    "text": "Glendale businesses really need to learn how to train their staff, because I've had similar problems all over the city lately . I came in here to pick up an online order and had an...interesting experience. There was a group who came in before me already waiting for their food. I gave my name to the woman behind the counter and stood apart from that first group to wait for the food. After a couple minutes the woman behind the counter makes direct eye contact with me and holds up a bag, so I start to step forward. Someone from the other group slid in front of me and asked the counter woman 'Is that ours?'. She nodded and handed over the bag, so I assume I misunderstood and continued to wait. Nope. That was my food. The group proceeded to check the order over and realize the mistake so they take it back up to the counter and have to tell the woman THREE times that it's not their food while she insisted that it was for 'her' while pointing at me behind them. Finally they turn around and see me and tell her that I wasn't with them and hand me the bag. Lucky for the counter woman that I don't like to be 'that customer' otherwise I would have demanded they remake my order after those other customers unwrapped and possibly touched my food but I just wanted to leave. We ordered a bit of everything: tacos, a vampiro, a mulita, and some nachos (the Friday special). Everything was fine except the nopal taco wasn't very good. The freebies that you can take with you are guac, cilantro with onions, just onions, limes, and sauces. The mild sauce and guac were really bland and just not very good on anything we tried it on. I'm not sorry we tried this place but I don't think I'm gonna be back. The one plus I can think of right now is the prices, which are extremely cheap. We got a lot of food for just over $20 so that's always nice.",

What got our attention was the $1 street taco advertisement only to find out they were $1.75 a taco (comes with onion, cilantro and green liquid they call guacamole) I asked for just cheese on the tacos and that was $1.99 a taco. The carne tasted good, chicken was mediocre. I would MUCH rather go down the street to Mucha Lucha taco shop and get 5 tacos for $7 and be able to choose from over 6 types of meats and have whatever toppings I want on my taco for NO additional charge. I'm all about supporting businesses like this but I will not be back again. $28 and 14 mediocre tacos later and I'm super bummed. Good luck to them though...",

I would like to see a little more pineapple on the tacos, only had a couple tiny pieces on them.don't know how I feel about the guac. On the tacos..Although it's tasty, for me doesn't seem very authentic, to just slather them with guac, seems to take the focus off the meat.I would order some without the guac. And u will see what I mean. the yellow corn tortillas they make here are great. Also would like it if they came with grilled mexican green onions and a grilled jalapeno like some other places offer. Paying with a card is no problem, unlike some other places.English was commonly spoken here, so no worries about language barriers here for my non Spanish speakers. All in all a good place to come and eat tacos, appears very family friendly,but don't expect ambiance, its all about the food.",

The first issue they had one girl taking orders and getting drinks and it was busy. 3 or 4 other workers were sitting around eating watching her struggle at the counter. After we paid we went to get our drinks and the ice machine was empty. The girl at the register said oh when we told her and went back to taking orders while the rest of the workers still sat there and ate listening to this. My bf got frustrated and went to jimmy johns to get ice. While we were ordering we were informed that the toppings where now in a salsa bar type thing and you can get as much as you like! Sounds great right ? Wrong ! Almost everything was empty or picked over and the guacamole tubs were all brown and gross! The service was awful the food was worse the place was nasty I will stick to the other families Tacos Tijuana spot! I will never return!",

I am first generation American of complete Mexican descent, my palette is a well traveled one that has eaten every kind of taco known to man. With that being said, I came upon this establishment from a very much anticipated recommendation from a fellow taco connoisseur that knows his tacos. He told me this is just the place to be, PERIOD! I came on taco Tuesday, I saw their presentation, and this place has conquered my heart, gastrointestinal soul and the very essence of my heritage. Each bite of every taco I've tried is like walking down a new memory lane that has never been created until I came here. It's truly a religious experience in every sense of the phrase. April attended us at the front end and was more than helpful if you have any questions or concerns, which you really shouldn't. The ambience was kickass coming through with just the right kind of Mexican rock that I grew up with and then some. The lighting is just right and the food will knock your pantalones off. Thank you Tacos Calafia, I will always return and so shall you after coming here",

It was way better than this place. I felt like the meat from this place was cooked in salt. Super salty! Pieces of fat were in the meat as well. I can't stop drinking water. No go for me.",

The chicken is a processed chicken chopped up on a tortilla, the beef is chewy and chocked full of fat, and the al pastor is good, but again full of fat. I've eaten at taco trucks with more attention to quality. No one wants a mouth full of chewy precooked fat and gristle.   The salsa bar is good. Really good.   The lady handing the food out don't speak at all, no thank you, or anything.   I don't post often. But Phoenix is full of these half-good places. These taco places are trendy and fun for white women to have a safe taco for lunch.   It's just my opinion. Backyard taco is MILES better. But they are not traditional either. I haven't had a real legit street taco since moving here. So I've settled for the best of the SW... backyard taco for sure is bomb, and Rito's if you want fried California style but good.",

The concept is cool: Pay $14-something ($16 or so after tax) and load up on as many street tacos as you wish. I just wish I'd have come with an empty stomach, as I was only able to put down about 12. I was told the record was 30...  Anyway, you get a bracelet after paying, and with it, you get to order three tacos at a time, your choice between chicken (polo), carne asada (steak), and pork. I went with a mix of carne asada and polo. Both were good, and the salsa bar gives you some options for toppings. Overall, pretty quality tacos and a great idea for a hungry Mexican food lover.",

I know we live in the US where is all the land of filled with rice, beans and melted cheese, this is not how street food is serve in Mexico.  Another minus was the salsa/condiments bar, was messy and salsa was splatter all over the place, mix with each other's ingredients.  Not a fan of dirty spaces.",

Hole in the walls and trucks for me since I am Hispanic and truly know authentic Mexican food (especially tacos). The looks of this restaurant don't match the taste.

They have a lot of rules for the all you can eat and while we were paying the girl explained them to us, saying we wouldn't be able to sit either it only one of us got the 'all you can eat', so obviously my family wants to sit together, so we both got the deal. She then brought it up before I EVER said anything about it, her words exactly, \"because your kids are little, I won't charge you for them\" I then continued to ask her 3 OTHER TIMES about the kids because of the rules she said, and I advised her, my 1 year old probably won't eat but my 3 year old May have a couple bites or just eat 1 taco, she then continued to say that's fine, and continued to say because they are little we won't charge you for them. So I'm like cool, that's nice. If not I don't have a problem buying them a taco each. But everything seemed to be okay.  Fast forward to ordering our food, we could only get 3 each so we did and I asked one of the cooks for an extra plate because my son wanted SOME meat, A LITTLE bit of meat. Immediately the joke of a manger ran over to ask me why I was needed a plate. I advised my son wanted some meat. That's where everything started, he right away was rude and belittling me saying that i cannot be sharing, if he wants some he needs to pay for the all you can eat, saying I could get kicked out if I give him bites of my food. I understand they have specific rules but then I brought up the fact what the cashier told me, he right away said 'i misunderstood her' I asked her 4 damn times total about the kids and I know I didn't misunderstand. I said, the cashier is right here let's bring her over. Right away she was lying to her manager saying she never mention 1 thing about the kids and that whoever wasn't doing the all you can eat cannot sit in the section. So you want my 1 year old and 3 year old to sit by themself? If not, I need to pay $30 for them to maybe each half or 1 taco. WHAT!  After going back at forth, the cashier continued to lie and the manger in the evening continued to belittle me and talk down to me like I wasn't even a human. My kids were standing right next to me as this was happening and they both continued to attack me right in front of my kids to see, they were both very shaken about what happened and were continuing to ask me, 'if mommy was ok'.  I've never been treated so badly in my life before and for someone to continue to lie about not saying she told us. And for a manager to continue to say I misunderstood her? I had no problem paying for 3 extra tacos for the kids. It's the fact of how it was handled and what took place.  We made sure to get a refund because at this point we were not going to eat there, as I'm trying to collect my kids stuff the manager was basically harassing me to leave and push me out the door.  I will never come back here again and I hope other parents know about how you could be treated on the all you can eat days. Don't plan to sit with your kids unless you want to pay $15 for them to eat maybe 1 taco.  This was a horrible experience and being a Manager myself, I would never treat anyone the way i was treated.  This place and experience was a complete joke.",

This place has tacos from straight Tijuana, Mexico and it's probably the most amazing tacos I have ever had. Meat is of best quality, horchata is non-grainy, salsas are amazing, and guacamole thicker than a snicker. Don't forget to ask for grilled onions, you won't regret it.  -Herman Loredo  P.S. Normally Im too lazy to write reviews but this came from the bottom of my heart. Yum!",

Side note...I'm allergic to onions so most guacamole is filled with onions. Not here, you add your own onions. That alone is why I'm giving this place five stars.   The one issue is I dislike when the staff is more concerned about talking to one another then the customer. I waited at the pick up window longer then necessary waiting for a break in their conversation about music.",

The nachos would be really good if it was fresh made chips but they used the yellow round store brand bagged chip, which made them not so good.

What you get is a about 5 inch tortilla with some meat on it, during the time we waited I had observed others so when we got our food we headed for the extras bar. Here I was a little disappointed. The selections was onion, cilantro and onion, guacamole, several offerings of sauces. I am sure I may of missed something. No lettuce, tomato, cheese. The sauces had no labels on the handles with the exception of one that I believe said mild. The one I chose had no label and it was very hot. I would or chose this one but would of put less on my taco. It was fine though and I enjoyed my meal. I am sure I will be back and try some of their other offerings. More section on the extra bar would be nice. I did deduct on some onion but i am not a fan of cilantro or guacamole.",

Employees worked quickly to try and get everyone's order taken and ready, but still took a little while just bc there were so many people. I would recommend ordering ahead of time or coming at a less busy time",

    "text": "This place is definitely up there. Since moving from LA, I've been looking for the perfect carne asada nachos. I've had basically all other options in Phoenix and wasn't that impressed. I'd actually begun just making my own at home because I need every element (cheese, meat, toppings, type of chips, red salsa) to be just perfect to cure my nacho nostalgia. On that note, sometimes having them made for me, without the time and mess, is a better option. I came across this place by chance because I was in the area. They looked like Tacos Tijuana (which is still my favorite Tijuana style taco in Arizona)  but had the element of actual options. On numerous occasions I've longed for Tacos Tijuana to offer nachos and burritos but alas they keep their menu small (and just delightful). It turns out this place is owned by someone that came from Tacos Tijuana so seeing nachos on the menu made me hopeful. Now the review: they let you put toppings on at a full toppings bar (including guac, yeah you heard me) and that made me very happy. I ordered extra cheese because I like my nachos drenched and when I dipped my finger in the cheese was kind of disappointed. The lack of flavor was quite apparent but I liked the consistency (yeah, totally a nacho snob) so I continued to add my toppings. Once I actually ate them I realized the cheese was perfect. Their meat and toppings  are so damn flavorful that the cheese fit right in. At that point I assumed that if their cheese had been too flavorful it might have distracted from that delicious meat. I get it now and am very pleased. I will definitely be back for them if in the area but it is quite a drive from me, so for now I'll continue to make my own and find reasons to drive out there.   Their free taco at check-in was a tad skimpy but I'm assuming that's because it's free. But I guess that's NACHO problem.",

This is THE no frills, bare bones, vibrant and friendly neighborhood type taco joint. Where they lack in \"decor\" they make up in flavor and authenticity. Best Mexican tacos I've ever had were in Mexico City or Tijuana and the food here is right up there with both. Even the young cashiers was super passionate about the place. If you're a foodie or just looking for some amazing tacos you should check this place out. Simple. delicious. Fun.",

One of my tacos could have been all grizzle by the time I picked out the pieces .  It was near closing so only half the salsa bar was out , which was fine except for most containers were empty minus the overpowering container of onion and the non labeled salsas. The red ( I believe chipotle based) is super hot and a warning should definitely be put there. We waited for the guacamole to come out and the girl got the empty containers that had some of the old guacamole remnants left and obviously had started turning brown and black and put the fresh batch right in! I would also change the trash cans. It doesn't seem sanitary to be opening a trash lid full of trash to pile in more .",

However I feel like that women could have ran the show alone. If she wasn't cleaning she was preparing to go orders or calling out dine in orders. She was always doing something just like it should be. You could tell that place being ran efficiently was important to her. That is what I call a valuable employee. My family and I will be back. Hopefully Tacos Calafia will be there for awhile.",

( not all employees) we asked for a table to be cleaned and we got an eye roll and a scuff like if it was so hard to grab a rag and clean off a table. They should have someone cleaning since they are very busy on TACO TUESDAY and obviously no one wants to eat at a messy table. To top it off no one ever came to clean it so we had to wait for a table to open. Great Service.",

First thing that stuck out was the artwork that is relevant to Tijuana and Baja California. Once you walk in you order from the list of meats to combine on the soft tacos. Today, I went with 2 orders of carne asada & 2 orders of Cabeza(cow cheek) tacos. The \"salsa bar\" had an assortment of diced onions, cilantro, limes, homemade guacamole sauce, etc. I choose all those and topped off my tacos nicely.  The tacos were simply amazingly flavored! 4 street tacos was enough to fill me up! Next time I am in the area I will bring the family!",

There is ALWAYS a line, don't let it scare you away, once you order, food comes out quick. There's good hot sauces and cilantro and guacamole on the taco bar. The Al Pastor seasoned pork has a little kick, just enough for my liking.   Biggest gripes are lack of sour cream, tomatoes/pico, lettuce on the toppings bar, and of course the agony of waiting in line to place your order... also, the placement of the soda fountain machine isn't very convenient if you're getting the extra hot sauce and need refills.",

Don't expect waiters or waitresses, but rather a delicious, very casual meal accompanied by a toppings bar (guacamole, onions, cilantro & salsas). It's a fun place to head to after school or work with a few friends. Not to mention, they have an all-you-can-eat tacos deal for $15 on Monday's and Wednesday's.  Pro tip: I ordered the \"naked\" mulita, which replaces the tortillas with crispy cheese instead.... a greasy, yummy mess! The carne asada and al pastor were perfectly done.",

( braised cheek) extremely delicious, well seasoned, rich in flavor add a little lime, onion and cilantro and some of the super spicy red salsa from the salsa bar and you'll have an out of this world experience!!   We tried one of each taco; nopal ( grilled cactus), asada, al pastor and the cabeza taco. Not a fan of chicken tacos so we skipped it but I can only imagine they are good as the rest of the food items are so good. I'm happy they don't add any cheese to the tacos typically tacos don't have cheese so was thrilled to have an authentic taco.   The quesadillas are so worth it. I'm a purist so only cheese for me and to my surprise it's all white cheese !! So happy. Hate getting quesadillas with yellow cheese. I love love love that they let some of the cheese crips on the outside of the tortilla so when you bite into it you get salty crunchy then soft and gooey !! So savory.   Best margaritas I've had in Phoenix for 4 bucks Thursday is 2 for 1 the Michelada was on fire! My mouth is watering thinking about It.   I just left tacos Calafia and I want more tacos! You won't be disappointed with this place. Be prepared to wait in line it is a popular place and well deserved!   Ask for the Chile's toreados to give your tacos a kick!",

Their meat is diced up so extremely fine that it creates more surface area for seasoning creating an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth! (PARTY)  They also have great deals throughout the week. They have an AYCE taco day! Their tacos are street size so BRING IT ON.  This place is very busy throughout the day. I've never visited without waiting in a fairly long line.  Awesome plus, THEY HAVE FREE GUAC! There is a self-serve salsa, cilantro, onion, lime and guac bar.  If you're still reading this then that means you aren't on your way LOL",

We all got tacos, I only got carne asada and the meat was moist and flavorful, and didnt make my tortillas mush. My friends got a mixture of chicken and carne and liked the chicken better. I also got Mulita Al Pastor, can't say myself or my friends were a fan of it at all. Tasted sweet, but I wouldn't mark that against them, might just not be our preference. Everything else about it was good, so maybe I'll try a different meat. Carne Asada nachos were simple, chips, nacho cheese and meat, yet delicious as well. Salsa bar was fresh and presentable, guac was good not that watery kind. Salsas were flavorful and had good spice. Overall would recommend and go back myself if ever in the neighborhood again.",

Awesome experience and we will definitely be back with our kids who will love it all!!",

Fresh corn tortillas (that are perfectly warm and soft, not kind of stiff kind of stale tasting), quesadilla that's filled with meat and not all cheese, standard \"con todos\" toppings including guac (real, simple guac, not the doctored up premade kind), mulitos also to die for. Casual atmosphere that feels comfortable and pleasantly buzzing. Went on a Sunday afternoon and felt right at home.",

The carne asada is perfectly marinated, it has almost a slightly tangy orange flavor to it, the al pastor is as well just as amazing as the carne asada. The pollo asada is as it should be, have a slight crunch from the crust on the chicken. The cabeza also follows suit with it being juicy, it just needs a little bit of salt to amplify the flavor.  If you're not a taco type of person, they do have other options, their quesadillas are just as good and they are also $5 cheaper than your local Federico's quesadilla when they are pretty much the same size in comparison. They do have other options but I unfortunately wasn't able to try them.  When you receive your order, they have a salad bar available for you to load up your tacos. Their guacamole as well as their salsa are absolutely amazing and if you can stand the heat, I highly recommend the red salsa because it has an amazing flavor unlike most salsas where the heat just takes over and completely ruins the meal. I hope you find this helpful and definitely think about giving this place a shot if you've never had it.",

The quesadilla was stuffed with so much meat and cheese, not like other places where it's mostly tortilla. They also have the best spicey salsa. The only thing I didn't like is that they charge you for cheese on tacos. I dont get how they charge for a little cheese but give guacamole for free? Also, inside on the napkin holder they advertise a free taco for a Yelp or Facebook check in. When I asked the worker at the register he said he didn't know and thinks it is only for Facebook. I wasnt going to bring the napkin holder to him for a free taco. Haha maybe next time",

It was nice that they offered free guacamole. The lime wedges were dry and had 2 dr-5 drops per wedge, and I'm not exaggerating! The margarita was also mediocre and my wife didn't even finish half of hers.   Service: the cashiers were incredibly slow and unfriendly. The people at the taco pick up were very nice and upbeat.   Cleanliness: bad. Tables were sticky. We had to hunt for clean chairs. The floor was a bit nasty as if it hadn't been cleaned all day. Sad to say that one of the \"Berto\" taco shops is better.",

Another one tontrybare the tacos nopales, which is made from Cactus. Dont knock it till you try it. We also had the vampiro tacos, which is much like a tostada with meat and cheese. The kids had quesadillas and said those were some of their favorite. I also like that they are making their tortillas fresh.  It's great to have an authentic place like this in surprise.",

They're known for their el pastor but I love their carne asada. If you haven't tried it here yet, then your missing out. This is the best street tacos place ever. I remembered coming here when they were fairly new still but they've grown so much and so fast.   Recommended?: YES! Food: Delicious! Cost: Super reasonable. $1.75 per street taco! They have happy hour, weekday specials and Taco Tuesday! Pro: They have a self serve station for guac, limes, cilantro/onions, and salsa. \"We could do it your way but don't get crazy\" -Bon qui qui Con: this place is pretty popular since the food is amazing, so expect long lines during dinner time and I'm pretty sure probably busy for Taco Tuesday too.   Let's be honest, the west side food scene isn't as nice as the east side where Tempe is. But this taco place is definitely one of best taco/food place. And this is one of my top favorite taco place too. I normally order the carne asada which tends to be the most popular item on the menu too. Their salsa is pretty good. They have mild, medium, and hot. A few drops of the hot sauce is pretty spicy. The first time I came here is when they first open for a few weeks. And I finally got the chance to go again since this place is far from where I live. I have noticed that they had made a few changes like having weekday specials and taco Tuesday. It's a great price and great food. So I definitely ordered the tacos and I also ordered the quesadilla too. But I like the tacos way more. Knowing that this place is very popular, expect a line during dinner time rush hour haha.",

The tacos themselves are smaller than what you'd see in the American fast food restaurants, but the quality is a thousand times better.   Once you get your tacos, there is an island in the middle of the restaurant where you can get an array of different sauces and toppings. If you don't, the tacos (or what ever else you ordered) will only contain the meat of your choice.  The restaurant itself is easy to spot from Thunderbird Rd due to signage, but traveling down 83rd you might miss it. It's bigger inside than it looks on the outside, and there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. It's often very crowded around dinner hours.",

We went there on Friday at 8:40 and the place was packed- I mean literally could not find a chair and the dining area is huge by taco-place standards. The options are minimal; chicken, steak, pork and beef cheek on corn or flour tortillas. They also offer quesadillas, mulitas (basically a quesadilla but with corn tortillas, and a few others.   The pros: We tried the steak, chicken, pork and beef cheek tacos. Everyone liked the pork (el pastor) tacos. The tortillas are hand made and delicious. I hate flour tortillas- literally cannot stand them. Tried these and they are the first flour tortillas I've ever liked. They're so thin and delicious. There is a large taco bar for salsa toppings and the horchata is great as well.   The cons: I think there was a bit of a hang up in the kitchen, it took us about 35 minutes to get our tacos. Considering they are tortillas and meat and you do the toppings yourself that felt like a long wait. I honestly could not recommend the chicken taco. The chicken tastes like poor quality or poor cutting on the cooks side. There is a lot of gristle and tendon in the chicken taco- we had three of them and every chicken taco had tendon in it- not appetizing.",

We had the following tacos: * Chicken - a bit dry but the salsa helped * Carne Asada - tasty but a bit chewy * Cabeza - juicy delcious * Al Pastor - sweet  deicious * Vampiro Taco - kinda like a tostada topped with Carne Asada  Salsa Bar with 3-4 different type of salsas, cilantro & lime.  Would love to see the salsa bar with roasted jalapenos & spicy pickled carrots.    It was a long drive and was with it. We will def be back",

Al pastor had some flavor. I've definitely had better. Doctor it up with their salsa and stuff and it's decent. I mean they're good just nothing I'd drive out of my way for again. If I were in the area and wanted tacos I'd stop by but there's a taco truck parked at a gas station near my home that has great tacos that I'd go to first.",

    "text": "Hoo boy, I discovered Tacos Calafia a few months ago, and man is it difficult to stay away. The tacos are so cheap, and so delicious, every time I drive through the Thunderbird/83rd intersection, I find myself racking my brain for any reason to stop and get tacos.   Tacos Calafia taco ranking:  5 - Nopales vegetarian tacos - not for me, but if you need veggie tacos, I mean, they have something, that's nice 4 - Chicken tacos - just great grilled chicken, juicy and crispy, but I could make this at home 3 - Carne Asada - you know you make great tacos when carne asada gets 3rd place!! 2 - Cabeza - Cabeza means 'head,' I don't know exactly which head cuts they use, probably some tongue, maybe some other ones, but it's kind of a juicy  raised beef mixture, a unique and delicious taco 1 - Al Pastor - spicy pork, speared with a pineapple topped spit, just the outside crispy bits served to you, this is the star of the show.   Homemade corn or flour tortillas, you can't go wrong, they're both great - I think I slightly prefer the flour, but corn is nipping at flour's heels. Get a classic taco truck beverage - Jarritos Mandarin, or Sangia Senorial, or horchata - then head over to the toppings bar. They have salsas, and tub o' guac, but my recommendation is to skip that and just load up on onions for crunch,  cilantro for freshness, and limes for the acidity - save that salsa for chips, the salsa heat drowns out the spices in the two best tacos, Al Pastor and Cabeza.   Then dig in, I usually get 5 tacos and a drink for about $10, and I can sit outside or inside. The best bite is an Al Pastor taco with onions, cilantro, and lime - Calafia Mafia!!!",

Once inside, you know immediately by the incredible aroma that you are in the right place for great tasting Mexican food.   On this visit I  tried each of the three tacos.  Everything was delicious; the tacos pastor was incredible. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious.j  I would highly recommend a stop for lunch or dinner.  Nothing fancy; but really delicious food,great service, and wallet friendly pricing.",

    "text": "VERY IMPRESSED!!  So, I drove right past this place and had no idea the gem inside! Just a generic sign outside that said \"tacos\" and I thought to myself ...uh restaurant owner that's not nearly enough information to pique anyone's interest!  I've had this place bookmarked for some time but never knew this was that place...not worth losing a star for but PUT UP A REAL SIGN so your restaurant seems more official rather than food truck-y.  FREE TACO WITH YELP CHECKINS!!!  I wasn't too hungry but since I was in the area I thought I'd try a couple tacos. They seemed really small in the pics and they are but so is the price. $1.75 REALLY!?! AND 20% OFF ON TUESDAY!  Possibly the best food value of any restaurant in the state when you also consider the free taco!  I ordered carne asada (cubed steak) and cabeza (shredded beef cheeks).  The carne asada was very tender and delicious. The cabeza taco was out of this world good! Basically tasted like super tender pulled beef.  Last impression was the amazing salsa bar. It has multiple places to stand that all have the same toppings so no need to wait in a line..that is if they're not busy. The salsas are legit! Carefully taste before dowsing your food. The medium left me burning for a while, can't imagine what their hottest is like but the flavor along with the heat of medium was plenty for me.   This value is so good that long lines are to be expected. Go between 2 and 4 if you want to avoid that. Food came out in about 1 minute and was delicious.",

The margaritas only come in the original flavor, but they offer it on the rocks or as a slushie. The slushie version felt refreshing. I only wish they offer more flavors.   The tacos themselves were also solid. I could honestly say that the carne Asada one of the best I've ever had. While the al pastor and cabeza were tasty as well. The  flour tortillas themselves were also an interesting texture. It tasted chewier than I am used to but again not a bad thing.  Salsa bar was clean and the guacamole was delicious. I recommend trying the hot sauce because it is actually hot. It wasn't a too spicy I can't eat hot, but an enjoyable level of spice.",

Salsa bar is serviceable, and even includes a hearty guac. Probably the best tacos in a 15-minute radius, even compared to their spiritual predecessor Tacos Tijuana.  My primary gripe with Tacos Calafia is their poor organization and lack of professionalism. Placing an online order is a real headache, as they use a glitchy third party system and, believe it or not, do not actually have a working phone number. Come on, guys, it's 2019. I had to physically visit the store to modify an order, and after speaking to multiple staff members who all seemed equally clueless, was told I could not add to an order--even days in advance. Again, the food is great, but order online at your own discretion.",

    "text": "Ok so I am straight up when it comes to leaving reviews, so with that in mind let me tell you this place looks ok and might do if you are not an extreme taco lover, but in reality the only thing that keeps my review from being a 1 star is the hand made tortillas. My wife and i went on a Thursday night which was not too packed but they did have a bit of a crowd,  we ordered two tacos de asada, one de pollo, one de pastor and one cabeza. We also ordered one asada vampiero. For a drink we ordered a horchata. First off when our order was ready I went to the pick up window and there was some confusion. They did not know what tacos I ordered even though it shows on the receipt and order slip. They cook had to sort them out and set them straight by this time I waited maybe 5-6Mins at the window. They was still calling numbers to pick up food and a line was forming behind me, by the time I got to my table the food seemed like it cooled down a bit. Second the horchata we received was warm probably not enough ice in the cup. They have salsa bottles you can take to your table, red and green are the choices. You can not taste a diffrence in them as they are both spicy, now don't get me wrong I love some spice but when you can not taste any other flavors there is something wrong. As far as the meats the cabeza was ok had some flavor to it maybe it was the juice they give you to pour on to your tacos. The asada and the pastor was a bit dry and not enough flavor, you can tell when someone has put there heart into cooking and this was missing it. The pollo was ok it did have some flavor and a bit of juice in it but other then that it was nothing to write home about or even justify going out of the way to come back.",

I know \"taco\" but the rest, not so much. The tacos are street taco style (not mentioned in menu) and there are no side items or chips on the menu and there are no fountain drinks. They had 3 big ice chests with bottles in them. The bottle opener was hanging on a string near bye.

Since this was my first time and obviously haven't tried everything. I'll start with the one line strike...the Pollo aka Chicken taco. It had no flavor other than the charred taste. Next, the asada (steak) taco...really good. Nicely seasoned, moist, chopped into thinly sliced, easy to chew cubes. Finally, I had the pastor (pork) Vampiro. This was friggin awesome! The pastor had such a great flavor but then you mix it with cheese, guac and grilled onions all on a perfectly sized tostada! Man! The tostada was homemade so it didn't fall completely apart as you are biting it. All in all I would definitely go back and recommend this place although I would not waste time or money on the chicken. Looking forward to trying the Mulita and the tacos de Cabeza. The Pastor though!!!",

Only thing I didn't like was there wasn't enough cheese in the quesadilla. Depending on what time you go it can be very busy and a line can form. If you check in you get a free taco.",

It is such a simple environment. Simple menu. Two suggestions are offer chips for customers eating in, and maybe add a burrito option too. There was only 1 thing I did not like and even that still wouldn't cause me to lower my rating just wont order it again. I personally don't like the nacho cheese sauce I prefer real cheese.",

Let me just say I've never had any Mexican place do a quesadilla they way they have, and I'm glad they did because it has separated them from all other places I've had before. What i liked about it is they put cheese on the outside of your quesadilla and grills it to provide this nice cheesy crunch that's not overpowering, also they are not greedy with their meat. It was a perfect balance and it's very filling. The taco tortilla is definitely homemade and fresh.... you can taste the difference. My husband said the chicken was nicely grilled and flavorful.   Cons: I didn't know what to do with our trash and tray. I felt awkward leaving it on the table....... otherwise... I'll definitely be back.",

Will compete with Tacos El Gordo out of CALI and TJ.  2) Pastor- 4 stars, needs a little bit more sweetness with a hint of pineapple flavor to take the reign against all other top street type tacos.    3) Horchata - top notch just the way I like it.  4) Costs - 5 Stars at $1.75 per taco.    5) Flavor - No doubt the best I've had in AZ.",

Things we liked: the tacos (nopales, chicken, and al pastor -- all good), we also ordered a chicken mulitas which was like a mini quesadilla sandwich. This was the perfect finger food. Good flavor. The price could not be beat. They also had Mexican Coke!  We will definitely be back. Things we will pass on: Michelada...was salty enough that it ended up going in the trash after a couple sips, the elote was weak..all cheese, wimpy kernels.   As for the salsa bar, wish the various salsas had been labeled since they don't have little cups to sample from. The consistency of the guacamole was off putting, so I passed on that completely.

You walk up to order and the person we had was less than friendly.  She did not take the time to explain the process or repeat our order.  Needless to say our order was incorrect.  She also did not provide our beverages.  We had to go back and wait in the line again.  We also wanted additional chips once seated and yet, you have to get back in line.   They needs an express line for example:  Additional chips or beverages only.  They call your number for pick up.  Got it - but it is so crazy with the long line and lack of direction where you pick up your food.    We had chicken, pork and the Carne tacos.  Chicken and Pork were excellent.   Our table was not really a fan of the Carne.  Would go back but hopes they can streamline the craziness when ordering and picking up.",

    "text": "I think one of the things everybody can agree on is that tacos are great. The only dissent may be the place to get tacos. Tacos Calafia is a great option for tacos, especially when it comes to value. It's a pretty crowded market out here since it's a major city in the southwest, but overall I would recommend this place.   First things first, the price is great. $2 for tacos with cheese, and $1.75 for tacos without cheese. I usually go for the carne asada, but they also have pollo asado, pastor, and tacos vampiros. $7 for a plate of 4 fills you up and is a good value for what the quality of them. Steak is always cooked tenderly, and it's a pleasurable eating experience. Also they have a great salsa bar too, with the hot salsa having a lot of heat to it and the guacamole is plentiful. That's about all you need at a taco shop.  This place is worth a visit if you want to get down on some reasonably priced, quality tacos. Sure there are flashier places, but they're a far drive. Why put off jamming out on your taco Tuesday instead of going here?",

Very clean, staff is fantastic and friendly!! Their music is bring everything together along with the sweet urban Tijuana mural.  Now to the tacos. We had asada, pastor and chicken. All great choices. Their corn tortillas are made by hand, paired with cilantro, onion, and guacamole (a little too much for my liking, but the flavor was amazing). Three different salsas, beware the darker salsa unless you're brave. I'll be coming back here and recommending to everyone and their mamas...literally! Gracias Tacos Calafia!!",

The order area and menu a bit confusing but after a few questions I ordered tacos with chicken, al pastor and Carne asada with everything along with a corn quesadilla al pastor. The flavors were spot on and the touch of guacamole and fresh tortillas were a big hit. The 3 salsas were in squirt bottles but not labled to help know what was in each. Red, Redder and Green were all watered down and bland.  I, like others have posted found it hard to carry the dirty plates while lifting the gavanized rubish bin lid to dispose, maybe a different bin or small table would help. Overall I really enjoyed the food and will be back. Hopefully the managment will address my concerns as I hope to give them all 5 stars soon.",

This place is killer, carne asada, pollo, Al pastor; all on point. I'd you haven't eaten here, you're missing out. HIGHLY recommended. Oh and the home-made corn tortillas? The best I've ever had, warm and kind fluffy, it's hard to explain. Just get down there and grub out.",

They have everything from vampiros (Tostadas with cheese and meat), Mulitas (a double tortilla quesadilla with meat) and regular style tacos(With meat lol) . Jokes aside, carne asada and al pastor as legit and if you come hungry or with friends, order the family pack (27.00)which comes with a tub of guacamole which is not extra, tortillas,salsa, one pound choice meat and all the fixings. It will save you money and you can even bring some home after if left over. Stop by and have some delicious tacos but don't forget the Mexican coke, because you know it tastes better in glass.",

We got our food pretty quickly considering it was dinner time and they were busy. They have 3 tables outside and decided to sit on the very clean tables and chairs. I was not disappointed in any of the food. Good flavoring and the corn tortillas were handmade, not too thick or thin. They never fell apart. I will def be coming back.",

I do not understand the hype, while it's probably the most \"authentic\" in the area there are smaller hole in the walls with better tasting everything.  Actually I lie the consome (broth in a cup) and red salsa were tasty.  I truly wanted to support raza but the trip was not worth it and I'm sooo bummed.   I gave them a 3 for friendly and fast customer service, I didn't wait more then 5 mins for my plate.",

As they can continue to transition from a food truck mentality to a restaurant I could only hope to have great things come from this place especially some nice rice and beans. Tonight I had the tacos cabeza which was outstanding as usual however a little on the greasy side tonight. The tacos al pastor was on point as with that great char. The vampire Taco was another success. I like the salsa bar with flavors ranging from mild to quite hot. I think the only downside still is that when I finish my ice cold beer and I want another there are still too many people in line. I can't go up and get another one without coming back to a cold plate of food. I'm sure they will figure this out eventually. DOn't make a mistake and pass on this place.",

Mulitas was okay but not worth the price. Vampiros was not impressive either and not worth the price. Elotes was horrible. Over cooked, dry and hard. Maybe they thought the toppings would hide how horrible it was. Don't bother ordering elotes. This place is in my neighborhood so I will go back for tacos only.",

They boast being voted Best al Pastor in the Valley and they do make a good al Pastor, but the chicken is better. Carne Asada is tough and chewy.  The salsa bar is a bit of a disappointment. They have two \"medium\" choices and an \"extra hot\", which kind of leaves anyone wanting \"hot\" in the lurch. It also kind of leaves the people wanting \"medium\" a bit disappointed, too, because the \"medium\" choices are a little closer to \"mild\". If they had escabeche, that would be a plus, but that's a minor quibble.",

    "text": "It's no lie that there's definitely not a shortage of taco options on the Westside. That's definitely not an issue. The problem is, however, that few of these places are worth recommending as anything more than just a quick fix with only a few exceptions to note.  Recently opened Tacos Calafia has the potential to change all that. I'm fairly certain that it's owned by the same people that run Tacos Tijuana, only the menu is slightly expanded.   The building used to be home to a sorta-steakhouse called Carvers and probably a few other businesses over the years. It's a pretty big space for a simple taco joint, so you'll have plenty of different seating options available. Calafia specializes in your traditional street tacos that are reasonably priced and executed surprisingly well. They also offer mulitas, vampiros, and the usual quesadillas.  My girlfriend ordered a mulita and two asada tacos. I ordered two pastor and one asada. For some reason, they messed up my order and brought out two asada. Since I didn't feel like battling through the line to complain, I just ordered a couple of extra pastor tacos to sample after I had finished. I also threw in a cheese quesadilla as well.  The asada tacos are fine, although pretty much the same as what you'd find at most places that know what they're doing. Their pastor, however, was excellent - completely living up to the praise that it's receiving from the few reviews this place currently has. I'd still recommend sampling both, but the pastor is clearly the superior of the two in terms of flavor. Additionally, you can have chicken, although I'll save that for another day.  The quesadilla was fine while the mulita actually impressed both my girlfriend and I. It's a great beefier alternative to just the regular tacos. They also were selling champurrado (Mexican hot chocolate) that we both really enjoyed. Although I'm not entirely sure if the item is a permanent staple, it damn well should be!  Are there better tacos in Phoenix? Of course. But in the immediate area, I feel this is probably one of the better options available.  Highly recommended!",

The tacos were basically you choice of meat on the shells (corn or flour). Very tasty!!  Al Pastor was our favorite, chicken least favorite  There was a ripping bar that had a couple different salsa types, cilantro, and some not home-made guacamole. Disappointing there was no pico or cheese.  Price was fantastic. $25 for 4 people, 3 sodas, and one beer. 25% Military discount. Wait was a little lengthy after ordering. Would go again. Not the best I've ever had, but highly acceptable.",

I normally would only eat about 3 maybe 4 tacos. If I go back I will stick with the 3 and not do the All you can eat. If you are a big eater its well worth it.   Since I had the All you can eat I tried all the meats they offered. They were all good. The pastor was my favorite. The marinade was on point with it. The tortillas are homemade fresh yellow corn tortilla regular sized. Toppings are cilantro, onions and guacamole with a half a lime. They allow you 2 tacos at a time.",

It wasn't too busy when I got there so I had a chance to scope out the place and the menu.   It's a pretty simple menu. You pick your entree choice (taco, quesadilla, vampiro, mulita, nachos) and then you pick your meat (carne asada, pollo, el pastor, beef cheek). They also have a whole bar just for toppings. (Salsas, onions, lemons, limes, guacamole and more). I love the options.   I chose carne asada tacos with flour tortillas. My son chose the carne asada quesadilla. The meat was very flavorful and tender. And the homemade flour tortillas were perfect! I ate 5 tacos and I normally am a 3 taco girl. I would have ate more but I didn't want to explode.   By the time I went up to order my 2 extra tacos the place was packed. I will definitely be back to try the other entrees. The mulita looks interesting. Like a taco sandwich.",

The quesadilla had a ton of meat, onion, and cilantro and was very filling. The quesadilla comes with grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno...perfectly complemented the quesadilla.

It takes waaaayyy too long to order and get your food. I know they're fairly new and probably have some kinks to work out. But we've come in a few times to get food to go and are here, at minimum, 30+ minutes. Maybe not enough staff? I'm not sure why it takes so long to order.

I got an asada with nopal thinking it was going to take me back to my childhood, it took me to the bathroom instead. No seasoning and it was chewy. Even my son didn't eat his 5 tacos and he loves tacos. My gf got a vampiro and she kept putting the all the condiments they have ( onion ,celantro, salsa and lime) and it was still missing something. Even the tortillas ripped when I picked it up. The only good thing this place has is free refills. And then I had to go find napkins because they only have 5 dispensers with 15 tables. Overall I will not be coming here. I feel like I've gave it my fair share of chances and each time I regret it. -1/10",

It was a little confusing at first, you get in line and pay, today Wednesday all you can eat Tacos... which I mean come on I had to give that a shot, anyways after paying you have to go up to a different line and get your food, still very much a food truck feel... sodas in cans or bottles... they do have horchata and Jamaica. Two tacos at a time... I tried pretty much all of them except the breakfast taco. Al pastor flavorful, pollo, carne asada, and cabeza... topped with onions cilantro and guacamole which I liked the guacamole it wasn't runny like other places.   Best in the West? In this part of town definitely but I'm in Tolleson so I have my to go to places. But this I will say the corn tortillas are bomb! I would go just for them! Staff were all friendly... if in area I'd come back idk if I would drive out of my way for it though but all in all it was delicious and I wish them much success! Represents authentic street tacos!",

After about a 20 to 25 min wait, the food came out, but the order was messed up. The girl got it fixed promptly though. The elote was awful, prob the worst I have ever had. The corn was not cooked properly and the seasoning was very bland. We ended up throwing it away because the kids wouldnt eat it either. The chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing that great. Tastes similar to El Pollo Locos chicken quesadilla, except this one only had chicken. You have to add your own toppings. The best part was the carne asada tacos. The meat was marinated well, but a little fatty in some parts. Still, with all of the toppings added, this was the best. I am happy they carry coke products to have with the tacos, however their drink machine is very high. Short people may have a hard time reaching it. In all, I would return for the carne asada and a coke. Skip the elote and just find a guy in the Peoria streets for that.",
