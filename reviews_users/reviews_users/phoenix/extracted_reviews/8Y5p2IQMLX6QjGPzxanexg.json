We ordered the pork belly and ribeye which were both delicious. I like to load mine up in lettuce wraps and decorate with the little accompaniments - yum!!! I thought that this place was rather affordable and I will likely try them in the future.",

    "text": "This would be my first Yelp review and my first time trying out this restaurant. I've heard good things about OHYA and I decided to go with my sister to eat there. We love Korean food and Sushi; we were excited that OHYA served both.   We enter the restaurant to be greeted right away and taken to our table. Our waitress brought out the water and menus within a couple minutes (maybe because it was late at night and not busy at the moment). We quickly decided on about 4 sushi rolls and the Katsu Chicken to start (we were expecting to have to order more food). After the waitress took our order, she sent it in and our food came out within 5 minutes tops! That was great because we were tired and hungry. The Katsu Chicken came out first and it wasn't the best Katsu Chicken I've had. It didn't have the crunch that most Katsus would have. I wasn't disappointed though, I still ate it happily.   Afterwards, the sushi came out and they were decently sized portions (a lot bigger sized pieces than most sushi places we've been to) and those four rolls had us full. We ordered the California Roll, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crab and the California Crunch. They weren't super fresh or super flavorful but they were still delicious. We even had some leftovers. We would definitely come back again!",

It seems like the texture is dried out and the flavor is bland. The sauce is probably watered down. It lost the yummy sauce/ flavor/ seasoning it used to have.  The kimchi pancakes weren't that great either.  I used to be so loyal to this place but after being let down the past couple times, I think I might as well just cook at home (and deal with the dishes later)",

The neon sign in the window said open, their hours posted on the front door said they were open, along with yelp. I kindly told them all 3 of these things were indicated they could do business but they just shrugged and said sorry....OHYA? OHNO!!

The waitstaff tend to be pretty hospitable, the food is delicious, and the inclusion of boba drinks on their menu in the last year or so definitely makes this place worth visiting again and again.  A word to the wise, however - while the food here is extremely delicious, the the taste and preparation may vary greatly depending on the chef on duty. So, yes, while the food is good nine out of ten times, just prepare yourself for the occasional dud. Also, if you've never had Korean food before, be prepared to pay a little more than you normally would at an Applebee's or a Chinese restaurant - you will certainly get your money's worth, but be prepared all the same.",

I ordered the K8 - Saeng SaeWoo Gui - Shrimp and vegetables and he ordered the K4 - Daeji Bulgogi - spicy pork. Both were the 'BBQ at your own table' type.    The aroma of the shrimp and the zucchini roasting in the sauce and changing colors really whets your appetite. The food was light, delicious and just the right quantity without making you feel like heavy. I ordered the Hazelnut coffee with boba. The drink itself was yummy but I didn't care too much for the boba.  The seating I would say is a little tight but the food and service are excellent. Very well priced too. And I got to enjoy some Korean TV drama as well :)  We're definitely going back to try a few more dishes!",

Ten minutes in more people trickled in. and then this is where the service started to get slow. We got our appetizer no problem. Then side dishes. Ten minutes later the entrees were ready. However, it took him 5 minutes to get our rice.  Another waitress showed up and we thought things would go smoother. We asked for our bobas and her response was \"he's by himself and working on it\".  I didn't like this response considering we had already been there 20 minutes without any drinks we ordered.

We decided on trying their KBBQ this time. I ordered the LA Galbi. And my friends ordered the bulgolgi. The LA Galbi had definitely been sitting for a while, it was no longer red, it was grey, and 70% fat and not marbled or of the quality in the picture on the menu. Kinda disappointing. Especially when it was 20.95.  We were starving so we pushed through.   Their banchan, is...laughable. We spent over 40 on two small plates of not great quality meat, and we were given 6 small dishes of banchan. One of them being macaroni salad. My gma would laugh at this place. What type of KBBQ place serves macaroni salad?   2 types of kimchi. Spicy seasoned bean sprouts. Regular bean sprouts. Potatoes and the very misplaced macaroni salad. Such variety, right?  At the end of our meal we discovered a very red hair on the new grill our waitress gave us. It ended up being woven into a piece of the bulgolgi. Gross. Before you ask, I have brown hair. My female friend had coal black hair. And the guys had next to no hair.   No point in telling them about it because we had eaten the majority of the meat, so the damage was done. You know?  Go somewhere else for sushi and KBBQ. This is a place for first timers that havent experienced good KBBQ.   Their ramen is good as well as the stone pot dishes.",

    "text": "The only 2 words I know in Korean are \"bulgogi\" and \"bibimbap\" so coming here was quite appropriate. I've been here many times and the food is great! However, bulgogi bibimbap does start to get boring after the 10th time. I should really learn some other words.  Twice a month they have Korean BBQ nights, where they pop open the grills and you order as much meat as you can eat in 1.5 hours. I find that the time limit is less of an issue if you eat it raw, but I also find that eating it raw is more of an issue. The price is more than what you would pay for a normal Korean meal, but less than what you would pay for the actual cow they got the meat from, so I'd say it's pretty fair.  They play Kpop music all the time, which is great because I used to love Kpop. Unfortunately, Kpop is synonymous with Gangnam Style for 90% of Americans, so I try not to break out in dance when GEE GEE GEE GEE BABY BABY comes on. Also I am not a dancer, but that's okay because according to The Killers, I could still be human.  Towards the back of the restaurant are several private karaoke rooms, where you can channel your inner Mariah Carey. The last booth of the restaurant shares a wall with the first karaoke room, so you can hear things coming from the other side. If you are sitting in that booth, you can quite literally hear Adele say Hello from the other side.  I am always satisfied with my experience OHYA. If you are not full by the time you finish your meal, then you need to learn how to order more food. I have had diarrhea after eating here before, but that's just me on a Tuesday.  ------------------  Best Korean restaurant that I know of in the area. Great for friends/family! 5/5",

    "text": "This is easily some of the worst service I've received. Anywhere. Ever. I didn't even come here to eat, I just came for a little get-together that involved a group of 15-20 people, a karaoke room, and lots of sake bombs.   Okay, maybe just A sake bomb. Mostly because it took forever to talk to anyone! There is a bar area that's separate from restaurant seating, but even though there was certainly the demand for a bartender, there was no one designated to take care of a counter with tons of traffic. In between serving tables, someone would come by really fast and take an order. It took nearly 40 minutes and several attempts to get someone's attention to be served.   If I weren't there with really cool people, I would just rage quit, leave, and never come to this establishment again.   After my order was placed, they fumbled around catering to the karaoke rooms, which understandably had priority, even at my expense. They ran out of the beer they'd normally use. They ran out of glasses and had to wash more. These poor young women were really busting their butts, and they were really nice. I don't blame them, they definitely needed one more person, and management that knows how to direct what were obviously some first-timers to the restaurant/bar industry.   My sake bomb was great considering it was only $5. It was huge! Came with a 20 oz. bottle. The karaoke room was fun. I've never been to one before, but if they're all like that...flashing lights, no noise pollution, and ample seating...then I've gotta check out some more.   What's also cool is that they serve food really late. Like, you can order til like 1:30, which seems unheard of for an authentic Korean establishment.   It seems like there are definitely some growing pains here. People definitely love this place, but staff have WAY too much trouble keeping up. Virtually all the credit for enjoying my time here can be attributed to my pals. I will be back some time in a smaller group, but I'll wait a little while for them to figure out what they're doing.",

I was also seated right away (also winter break helped because nobody was at ASU West) with pretty much no delay from the waitress...almost like she was stalking me. XP  Now for the food. I ordered the L3 Lunch Special: A Bento tray with white rice, Korean sides, spring roll (or gyoza), miso soup and the meat that you chose. It was good.  As for the service, it was not that great. Firstly, the waitress never asked me if I would like gyoza or a spring roll. Secondly, she never gave me my miso soup. Other than that, service was not that bad. I do, however, understand that she was the only waitress working today. But still, she should have asked.   Overall, the food was really delicious, and would have been better if I got the choice between gyoza and spring rolls and my damn miso soup. Whatever, it's okay. I hope it never happens again because the food quality outweighed the lacking service.",

We had the bulgogi, which is thinly sliced steak, and it comes with veggies, and rice.  The veggies include Korean pickles, potatoes, onions, and kimchi.  We also had yaki mandu, which is a Korean egg roll.  The service was prompt and couldn't be more friendly.  Very nice people, and the place is clean, too.  I will be back for sure!",

The last couple visits though the service has been lacking, it was me and my daughters boyfriend's Birthday and when my Girlfriend asked where i wanted to have my birthday dinner, Ohya was my top choice . She made a reservation for dinner and we were there on time. we were seated, then proceeded to sit with no way to order no drinks or water for almost 30 minutes finally the manager noticed us looking around for help as we were contemplating getting up and leaving, he came over and asked if we have been helped ,we said no not yet I haven't seen anybody since we were sat. then the waitress who had walked by us 30 times finally came and asked if we wanted drinks. we didn't have a menu as they have a paper menu for their sushi that you mark then she brought four of the five of us our drinks and we had to ask twice to get water for the fifth person after having to ask twice for the paper menus then having to wait for her to come back so we could ask for a pen to fill the paper menu out. when the food finally arrived it was great! then we ordered some to go rolls. even though the rolls we ordered were on the happy hour menu, because we were having them put in boxes, we had to pay full regular price, seemed odd as we were having it added to the same check. anyway,  we sat for an additional half hour or more waiting for the to-go rolls,   When she brought the check they had already added the gratuity $30 for pretty bad service!! their was only 5 of us , and most places only automatically add a gratuity if your party is six or more. I guess not here . I felt kind of ripped off. I wasn't happy about it but I paid my bill took my rolls and we left. I do have to say that for two of us having our birthday dinner, they did give us a frozen Slice of Cheesecake and a couple of little macaroons on a plate that was very nicely decorated and that I did appreciate. I just felt for the service I got I was not happy with having a $30 tip automatically added to my bill for a party of only five.",

One night everything might be decent, with fairly tasty food, late night hours and okay service. The next, the salmon sushi is the opposite of fresh, they bring you the wrong entree altogether, and the waitress abandons you to serve other tables (or maybe to join in on the karaoke, I was never quite clear which.) I have stopped coming here. Cheap sushi that might be horrible just leads to heartbreak, and I am too old to enjoy rolling the dice, especially where my pocketbook is involved. Essentially, unless you really like Karaoke or want to cook your food at the table (and you must buy a lot of food for that privilege) get your Korean or Japanese elsewhere.

    "text": "I'm a recent transplant to the Glendale area, and was anxious to try this establishment.  It absolutely did NOT disappoint.  I lived in S. Korea for two years, and miss the food like crazy.  But not just the food--the feel, the service, the Korea-ness of dining out in Korea.  I went in today for lunch, and it was like I had found a secret portal back to the awesome restaurant in my apartment building in Seoul.  The way the restaurant is laid out, the K-pop on the speakers, MBC on the TV--it's as authentic as you can find in the US.  The food.  I had the dol-sot (hot stone pot) galbi (pig rib) bi-bim-bap (mixed rice) and it was excellent.  The side dishes were regular kimchi, bean sprout kimchi, cucumber kimchi, and pickled radish.  I wish the kimchis had been spicier, but I imagine they're simplified a bit for American audiences.  I'll update my review after I get a chance to have the BBQ.  $8 for samgyeopsol M-Thurs nights is a pretty good deal here in the states, and I'm excited to check that out.",

There is something wrong with the shrimp. Eww, my roommate said, \" it tasted like snot going done her throat.\" Ps. About the sweet shrimp. We got vegas , spider, tootsie, and cali. The only decent food we got tonight was the vegas rolls. I also ordered a coke and never recieved it.  The service was really slow. I mean anyone who had acholic drinks got served more often and faster than we did. Worst dinner ever. Never coming back. Take our suggestion and go elsewhere. Stay clear of this place. Plus, our table had been scratched and marked up by people to the point it looks like a ragged table in the middle of a nice looking place with horrible food.",

Sushi plates were presented very well but it took so long for them to get it to us.  The staff were nice but service was kind of slow.  You have to be aggressive and wave your hand high to get their attention.  We will be returning to this place as the food were very good, but we will have to time it and make sure not to go during busy hours...which is lunch time and dinner time.",

    "text": "While on a recent adventure with a childhood friend, we decided we wanted Korean BBQ.  We normally frequent other establishments but a while back, someone had told me about this place.  So by chance, we stumbled upon Chuhgajib.  During our an hour and a half extravagant lunch, we were the only ones in there.  I normally try to stray away from barren restaurants but we were already spotted by the owner.  He had sat us down in a very artistic yet uncomfortable table and that's when our feast began~  - Haemul Pa Jun [Seafood and Veggie Pancake]:  The haemul pa jun was delicious!  It had the most amazing dipping sauce and was quite a large dish.  I've had various kinds of kimchi pancakes at other Korean BBQ places but I think this place probably tops the cake with better dipping sauce.  - Jap Chae [Stir-fried Glass Noodles with Vegetables]:  The jap chae was pretty standard.  It had a lot of vegetables and stayed insanely hot throughout our meal.    - Bulgogi [Marinated BBQ Beef]:  Like the jap chae, their bulgogi was pretty standard.  I did enjoy the sauce that they marinated the beef in.  It was very flavorful and cooked to perfection!  Overall, Chuhgajib is a pretty nice place --- not my favorite but not too shabby!",

Other than that, the kbbq is pretty good. My gf got the teriyaki chicken, which is probably one of the best one I have had. They usually have AYCE kbbq, but it's selective on odd days of the week. $20 for kbbq and $25 for sushi and kbbq. The next one is April 18 & 28. They have karaoke rooms and all day $5 sake bombers! You can't really beat that. If the service was faster this place would definitely get 5 stars!",

An absolute must try is the hamachi popper- we also really like the crispy tuna. Price is great on sushi is excellent. If you don't have a groupon make sure to order on their happy hour side- there is no time frame on happy hour menu...if u want Korean bbq maybe go to groupon",

This place is pretty small, maybe about ten tables that can seat 4-6 people but I didn't feel cramped at all so that was cool. Be prepared for a little bit of a wait as the few times I've been here there's been only one person tending to everyone.  I ordered a spicy beef stew dish that was freakin' excellent, totally hit the spot! Just don't come here super hungry because your stew will come out to you still bubbling hot in one of those soup stone bowls. I was much happier with this dish than the galbi and katsu dishes I've had here before, so I'm definitely sticking to the stew next time I come here!",

It is enough to feed two people! I included a picture of the portion size but it does not do it justice. I also wanted to try some rolls, so I ordered the dynamite roll (not pictured). After the first bit I noticed it had a little spice and different flavor, but in a great way!   Overall, our waitress was very knowledgable and helpful. Something that we also noticed was how kind and attentive all the staff was on our visit.   Keep up the great customer service and yummy food !",

Boy did they have a huge selection on a ton of rolls!! After glaring through the different rolls I decided to stick with my usual roll... the vegas roll!   It was pretty packed inside so my sushi took around 10 minutes to arrive which wasn't bad considering how busy they were. My sushi was delicious! Now on to what my co workers ordered! My boss decided to go with the big feast! So the cool part about it is that you get to cook it yourself!! I thought that was totally awesome! They bring you the food raw and you cook to however your heart desires!   I highly recommend this place and I will be returning again! 5 star for me ! Excellent service and food!",

We decided to order the big $80 Korean BBQ variety of meat. I think it was combo 7. It says it serves \"5+\" (5 or more ppl) there was 7 of us. When the plate came, it wasn't much meat. To be honest, the serving would of only probably be enough for 3 people to be full. I felt that it was over priced n there wasn't enough food. So we knew that it wasn't gonna fill us all up, my other friends ordered more things such as a sushi roll n two kids teriyaki rice bowls. In addition to that, we had to order another plate of meat too. Our bill ended up to be $151. I should of taken a picture of the plate. It would of been a lot cheaper if I just ordered regular food off the menu or may be even cheaper if I ordered individual plates of meats.",

    "text": "I've come to this place quite a few times. I absolutely love their sushi but after tonight I will not be returning. Service is VERY spotty. It's either hit or miss because they either have 1-2 people serving or 5-6. Tonight was fairly busy and only had about 3 people serving. I got seated quickly with my boyfriend and had our order taken right away and given waters. We order a chicken teriyaki skillet, a golden Alaska roll and shrimp tempura for an appetizer. He read the order back to me and everything was correct. The shrimp tempura was out fairly quick and my boyfriend was given his chicken teriyaki about 10 minutes later. However, he had just about finished his dinner and I still have not received my roll and at least 30 minutes has gone by. It doesn't take 30 minutes to make a sushi roll....our server finally comes back around to our table and asks if we needed to go boxes and I told him I had not received my sushi. He gave me a really confused look and without saying anything walks to the sushi bar and starts going through the little stack of order receipts that they write down your order with. He comes back about 10 minutes later and says \"I apologize, our \"power\" went out and your roll wasn't put in. Do you still want to order it or to take it off the tab?\" I said yes (kinda frustrated because he asked if I still wanted it, like yes I am here to eat dinner). However, I never noticed any any lights and computer screens or the kitchen lights or any power of any sort go out. We were right by the sushi bar and kitchen. It doesn't make sense to me because how does the power \"go out\" yet we received our two other items that were placed?? I think he had just forgot to put in my roll and didn't want to admit it. I'm really hungry at this point and getting frustrated because AT LEAST another 25-30 minutes had gone by. I noticed our server going to other tables and servicing them and it almost felt like he was avoiding our table because he would never glance over at us. A different server had come to our table and asked if we're doing okay and not our original server so that's why I felt strongly he was ignoring us. I told her we were waiting for a roll and she just said okay and walked away. Our cups were empty and were never offered any refills. My boyfriend saw the water pitchers close to us and went and grabbed one and filled our cups up for us because we were being ignored. When he did that a couple employees just looked at him but never said anything. Also, we're by the sushi bar and can see them preparing rolls and one chef is literally talking on his cellphone while making the rolls.......FINALLY, my sushi roll had come out but I didn't even want it at this point because it was taking so long (at least 40 minutes now) and we just wanted to walk out due to frustration. Our server only came to us about maybe four times the whole night. It doesn't take that long to make and since it hadn't been put in because the \"power went out\" you think they'd have it our right away but no. When he walked over with the roll before he could say anything but boyfriend asked for the check and to have the roll taken off our bill. He rolled his eyes and put his head back and just walked back. This was probably the WORST service we've ever had here. Other times we've gone in and waited for at least 20 minutes just for our drink orders to be taken when we've been sat before others and they're being served first... another time I had went in with a family member and we were the only two in there and it took them FOREVER just to bring out our drinks. Truly horrible service. Their sushi is great but I will not be returning anymore.",

I like OH YA because the interior reminds me of LA all you can eat Korean BBQ. This is the only place that has karaoke & a grill where you can self cook with your family and friends. I love the idea of it... but they need to hire servers that pay attention to their customers. Also they just always seemed under staffed.  I came in with my best friend and yes it was crowded on a Friday night. We waited 20 minutes to be seated and it took them 10-15 mins later to even take our order. We raised our hands multiple times so we can order but we were ignored. Our server finally got our orders down.. and she disappeared again. We are 15 mins in our meal and no one brought us water until we had to ask the hostess that our server forgot our water. Smh.   We ordered the green onion salad which is delicious! Soon Soup which was a little bit bland.. We also ordered the combo Kalbi, chadol & bulgogi which was pretty good.",

The daeji is slightly spicier not too much and it gets a nice char on the hot plate. All of the soft tofu soups are great. My favorite is the gut stew, maybe not for everybody but if you've had pho it's the same stuff. My friend orders it and just picks out the intestines it's that good. They also have Korean beer, Cass, which I find superior to all Japanese beers. The only thing I'm not in love with is the sushi. It's not bad but their signature rolls are kind of meh. Come here for the Korean food not the sushi.",

    "text": "There is definitely a cluster of good Korean restaurants in metro PHX and they're on the West Side, people.   Growing up and living in the Washington, DC area gave me ample choices for Korean restaurants and bars. If you ever find yourself in Annandale, Virginia, you'll be in the center of some of the best Korean food outside of Seoul. I've dined on Korean fare enough to know what's good and OHYA reminds me of those Korean barbecue spots from back east. You can fire up the tabletop grill and cook your food yourself or have the kitchen add fire to your beef, pork, seafood, chicken or pork belly. I singled out pork belly because you should definitely order some and you should cook it yourself so you can get it as crisp as you like. Or not crisp at all.  The side dishes that accompany a meal- AKA panchan/banchan are pretty good, although they are more on the sweet side and not as hot & spicy as the deep red color of the kimchi might convey. The cucumber kimchi is my favorite but I'll also ask for seconds of the sprouts dressed in sesame oil.  This is also a great spot for sushi and they have $5 Kirin sake bombers all day.   I noticed two private karaoke rooms so if you feel like partying with a group of friends, here would be a good location to try your vocals out. The one Friday night I was here there were multiple karaoke parties going on and every once in a while when the door would open for a cocktail order to be delivered from the bar, the sound of a cat being strangled with a wire coat hanger over the beat of an 80's power ballad would emanate from within.   Clientele was mixed and you won't feel like you're an outsider if you're not familiar with Korean food or customs. Wait staff will gladly answer questions and guide you along your way.  Korean cuisine is outasight and if you haven't tried some or you've been searching the valley for a spot to enjoy it, head over to OHYA.",

Anyways, this place stays open till about 1am on a Thursday night so it was nice there was food options while most places were closed.  Our waiter was very sweet and welcoming. My fiance thinks she was the owner? We liked her a lot.   FOOD - Galbi: We got two different kinds. The short rib one and the sliced up one. The marinades were great! However, the meat was so chewy. Not at all tender. So chewy that my jaw started to fatigue after chomping on my piece of meat for so long.   - Sides: There were six different sides. They were okay, not our favorite selections.   - Crunchy California Roll: I think it's hard to mess up a Cali roll so this was pretty good.   Coming from San Diego, we have a lot of great Korean restaurants so this was just okay.",

All of us fitted perfectly into the small karaoke room. It was $30 for the first hour, and $10 for every subsequent hour. We must have been terrible at singing since we consistently received a score of zero after every song. Apparently, the scoring system in the small room was broken, but the big room's scoring system was still intact. Darn, the big room was already reserved. At least we have the reassurance that we weren't that bad at singing.   The room has two microphones and a big book of songs. The majority of the songs are in Korean. Fortunately, they have a fair amount of American songs. We stuck to the pop section - our favorite. It was a fun time singing/eating. The food was mediocre, but served its purpose for hungry singers. I\"ll definitely return to do group karaoke here.",

Therefore, when my companion suggested it, I went there with trepidation but thought, \"What the heck.   Why not?\"  I had the six-piece chef's choice nigiri and he had one of the rolled sushis, which I can't remember the name, but, you know, typical rolled sushi, which, if you have read my prior reviews on sushi, I don't really care for rolled sushi that is mixed with heaven knows what.   I did try it, and noticed it had cream cheese in it.   REALLY??  Cream cheese in sushi??   He also ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer, which I found quite good.   The batter was light and fluffy and not overwhelmingly batter and one has to play, \"Where's the shrimp?!\"  My nigiri was good.   It was a fine selection of \"chef's choice\" as far as the product.  For $9, it was a screaming deal.   It came with the six pieces of nigiri, rolled sushi, a salad, and miso soup.   Quite filling for a lunch.   Too bad they don't have a closer location.   I would definitely frequent it more often.",

Like usually when hostess seat you, they give you menus? Confused part.   P.s. the hostess wasn't friendly at all. No smiles, just \"how many\" like dang, can I get a hi or hello.  Then our server took our drinks & food order. She was really nice but the Service was okay. We had to flag down our server a few times to get stuff refilled. Food taste okay,wasn't as great compare to the other Korean BBQ I been too. Side dishes really lack in taste and it wasn't fresh. Well the bean sprouts, my boyfriend said it was still frozen. There ddukbokkie was not good at all, only gave me 6 rice cakes the rest was veggies. I was so disappointed Bc I was excited to try it. But it was just BLAH to me. Nothing special about this place.   I don't think I'll return unless someone pays for my food,l. Hahaha. Also we went because I bought the $7 coupon that's worth $20 of food and drinks. So it wasn't bad at all. Other than that, just come before dinner if you want great service :)",

    "text": "\"Meh.\"  This place expanded, right? Same, familiar furniture which is perfectly fine but the floors have already seen better days.  Lunch specials are reasonable. We went here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch was alright. Dinner prices will at least double for you. They have a happy hour all day thing going on for now. I ordered some sushi. I wanted to try a couple so I ordered some cheaper ones, like salmon (a classic fave for me) and a california.   The weirdest tasting sushi ever. I have never seen a more disappointed-looking salmon roll. It is literally just a teeny bit of salmon wrapped around some rice. It is.. the size of the thumb. California rolls are really ubiquitous and so you don't expect much. But this is beyond that. I couldn't taste anything. I clearly see the avocado but nothing came through. Also, if the restaurant is reading this, get rid of the sesame seeds that the rolls are rolled in. It is so overpowering. So.. if you're ordering sushi, get the more fancy/expensive rolls.  I didn't have much of an appetite so I got something small, pork belly and mushroom skewers. Don't do it. As soon as I saw it, I felt like a total idiot. It's thin cuts of pork that tasted burnt and salty and small, small mushrooms. What is the point of skewering.  Boyfriend ordered an actual entree, beef teriyaki. I wished they didn't cook it so far because it kept on cooking on that sizzling plate and it got a bit tough but was still pretty good. The teriyaki sauce was good but thickened rather quickly.   I know most Asian restaurants charge for extra rice, but being Asian and growing up eating nothing but it, it annoys me to pay extra for a little bowl of rice to accompany even half the size of the dinner. I'll do it, though, but I get even more annoyed (?!) when that tiny, palm sized bowl is only half full.  Waitresses were OK. Not terrible. All three stood around chatting and texting so it felt like you were interrupting social time when you needed something.  I promise, I'm not a terrible, mean person :)   Wow, long review but I won't be coming back.",

If a sushi place claims to be all you can eat, then you should be able to pick and choose off that menu and it be unlimited. This sushi place only allows you to choose 6 rolls for all you can eat, meaning that it is NOT all you can eat. They also only bring out one roll per serving, so we're leafy sitting here still hungry while they slowly prepare our food. If you don't want to get all you can it, its worse. Your paying $10-$12 per roll for small rolls of sushi. It'd absoultly ridiculous. My fiance came to this place to have a date night and its the worst place to come and eat.",

    "text": "Ok so this is my third time there. First time AMAZING CASSEROLE dish! Loved so much I rented the Karaoke room for my team and had a blast. Third time tried the all you can eat BBQ. We were three people and they portion the same amount regardless of party size since couples next were getting same amounts but 3 people eat faster and more than two so we found ourselves waiting quite a bit for them to come offer more meat. There is a 90 min limit on all you can eat  and we were able to barely get two deliveries of food because the waitress hardly came around and this was BEFORE the rush. Turned out expensive for what we actually got and joked about getting something to eat on way home. It seems they control how much you actually eat by not coming around. Left bad taste in our mouths! And I talked this place up soooo much. Ughhhhh",

Otherwise it's pricey to order your meats individually. Great selection of Soju and Korean beer. Would recommend to anyone!",

Got a martini. cant remember which but it was delicious! Ordered the kimchi Chigae, it was also yummy. Ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke dish.. Tuna poke is my favorite dish and usually when i order it at other sushi places its not that great for the price, so i was really impressed. Also got Korean bbq of course, the galbi and samgyupsal was SO good. the food was SO flavorful and delicious!! And our server SIMON was such a sweetheart! Ended up spending around $80 for two ppl or so and i was tempted to order more because I was still hungry but i held back. All in all my favorite Korean restaurant in Arizona! I plan on making many more visits.  Did not get to try the karaoke or the sushi but theres always next time!  My friend was disappointed they didn't have bean sprouts as a side dish but that's about it.",

We did not like one of them and therefore did not finish it. The server and then the manager told us they would have to charge extra for \"excessive leftovers\", meaning they would charge us for the food and then charge extra for the uneaten food (which, in my opinion, was an excessive amount to serve us). We were flat out told \"those are the rules\". Don't go here. It's a scam. They serve large plates probably to over charge people for not finishing.",

The service was awkward, the preparation was awkward, the taste was a little awkward but nobody got sick and most of it was pretty good but the price was high.  Not awful at all, but did just did not meet my expectations in a great many ways. I might go back perhaps to try the sushi instead of the KBBQ, everything was just really incredibly average. The karaoke rooms did look pretty cool though.",

There are a lot more younger staff working here- not sure if it has new owners. I like all the changes. The other night I came here late with my son and it was great since they are open until late. Their menu is varied and extensive. If you don't find something that suits your taste buds then I think you must be an extremely picky eater! My son and I had the bulgogi with four side dishes, six pieces of sushi ($14.95) plus a California roll ($3.95). Plenty of food for 2 people with leftovers.  The waitress was super friendly and took a liking to my son so she couldn't stop smiling when she came over. Which is great cause a smile goes a long way under any occasion! The place reminds of a LA joint now for both old, young, bar, non-bar going crowd alike. I like it. I hope it does well and become more and more successful as the city grows!",

    "text": "I'm so torn about writing this update. I've been to this place more times than I can count in the last few years and I would even say we were friendly with the owners. The food was always good. That being said, I doubt I will ever go back.  Our party of 3 (and a baby) were seated and ordered quickly. My two companions had the meat/sushi combo for $15. One got Bulgogi and Nigiri and my husband got the Salmon Teriyaki and Crispy Tuna Roll. I ordered the small Sashimi plate ($20). For the kiddo, we got the Bulgogi bowl ($6).   I will say that the side dishes were good and we do love the kimchi. The Bulgogi came out first for my friend. It didn't come with rice but he liked it. My husband's Salmon came out next and it was the smallest piece of fish I have ever seen... Maybe 2 oz worth. He had to order a side of rice with it for $1. The baby's Bulgogi and rice bowl had more food than my friend's dish, which was weird. We had about 3 servings of the side dishes. The kimchi was good but the potatoes were flaked with ice.  45 min into the meal, we still didn't have any sushi. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said the Sushi Chef was backed up. A few minutes later, the manager/owner came out - presumably to help. I watched him watch football for a good 10 min before helping the Sushi Chef, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt in case there was something out of his control.  A good 10 min later, my friend got his 6 pieces of Nigiri. The only saving grace was that he did like it. A few minutes later, my husband got his roll.  At this point, everyone had been given their food but me and let's face it - a Sashimi dish  doesn't need to be cooked so almost an hour to deliver seems ridiculous.  The fish was fresh but I was unhappy. I had a $20 LivingSocial deal that I had paid about $10 on so that was deducted from the bill. We asked for boxes and the bill about 3 times before we got it. I'm not sure why - there were a few tables but there appeared to be at least 2 waitresses and a hostess.  When I looked down at the bill, it was not ours. In retrospect, it was only $28 so I should have just paid it. I brought it up to the waitress and she gave me the correct bill - $48 - WITH the $20 discount from my $10 coupon. I mentioned that I was a long time customer and that I was disappointed that the manager didn't even offer an apology or a comp - even on something small like the kids' meal. She said the manager told her no  more discount because we had a coupon.  At that point, I told the manager that I was very disappointed and had a very bad experience that night. He IGNORED me. He didn't even apologize.  I sat and waited for another 10 min for the waitress to pick up my money and to provide change. She never came so I found some smaller bills and left her a tip. I don't blame her for everything, but I was still unhappy.  After so many good experiences here, I am torn about giving this review because of one really bad experience. It would have been so easy to make this right. A heartfelt apology and acknowledgement from the manager would have sufficed as would an apology and a small comp. We got nothing after years of supporting this business. I feel like my business obviously doesn't matter to this establishment and I can't go back after this for a long time - maybe ever.  I know restaurants and people have bad or off days. I get it. We're all human. But, come on, make an effort!",

I usually go with a group of 4 or more and we always order combo #3 with bulgogi. Super good. The meat sometimes seems frozen, especially the samgyupsal but overall it's tasty. I would recommend reserving that table first if you're coming in with a group just because the place has really small tables that wouldn't fit all of your food on it. But overall my experience has been great.",

It took around 5-8 mins just to be greeted and sat at a table, and then another 15 mins just for our server to acknowledge us, and get our drink orders, we saw her tending to all her other tables and she had walked past us about 5 times until I finally got up and asked the hostess what was going on, as we have not even seen our waitress. I've had this same experience TWO times both of which they were not really busy which makes it worse.. No apology either for making us wait nearly 20 mins just to get some waters, which is why I'm giving this place 3 out of 5 stars.   I have not actually tried the Korean BBQ yet as I feel like it's something that should be done with a good group and normally my boyfriend and I just come here as it's so close, the food that we have tried is always delicious, I just wish the service was better as that's the only thing at this point that is making me not want to come back.",

My friend and I ordered a limited combo special where we got to pick one meat plate and one sushi roll.   We ended up ordering 2 combos and got the Galbi and the Daeji Bulgogi for our meats and got the \"Ohya I forgot\" roll and the Dynamite roll.   First, the meats were great. Very comparable to some Korean places in K-town of LA. I would definitely go back there for that. You have the option of cooking the meat yourself or having the kitchen cook it for you in the back. If you don't know how to BBQ well, then I definitely recommend you let the kitchen staff cook it for you. The traditional small plates that go with the BBQ were good too.   Unfortunately, the sushi fell really flat. That's really why I'm not rating this 4 stars! The \"Ohya I forgot\" roll was way too big and the sauce they used on top was too sweet. They also put a lot of the sauce. For the Dynamite roll, the scallops were cooked ok, but they again put way too much sauce. I would recommend asking if they can put the sauce on the side so you can control how much you want to put on it.   So, I will definitely come here for the BBQ and not for the sushi.",

    "text": "Ahh gaaaahh. Third time here. Two times more than I should have. Food is typically average. Only come because my parents are intrigued by their $8.50 lunch box... But this third time was just uuggghh. I try to be an understanding customer and not lash out at waitresses because usually if the food is crap, it's not their fault but I gave these two waitresses my first lashing because they let me sit there and boil for twenty minutes as I waited for them.   The experience (setting: there were only 5 other occupied tables and no one came in after us): 1) it was15 minutes after we were seated before we got water. We had to ask for it. Our glasses were never refilled.. Esp since they didn't come by until I called for them. 2) there were 4 of us. we had to ask for another utensil setting since table only had 3.  3) food took 10 minutes to partially come out. We had to ask for our miso soup since they forgot or didn't know our lunch came with it. Waitress told us that our two cali rolls would take a little bit. Those did not come out til 30 min later.  4) food was beyond poor. My teriyaki salmon didn't have a teriyaki glaze. Seemed like it was just deep fried. Hard - overcooked. My dads teriyaki salmon was   still raw in the inside. My moms bulgogi was flavorless and cold and galbi was hard and not marinated. My bfs tofu soup (soondubu) tasted Ok but not traditional flavor or what I'm used to. Wasn't even red. Daeji bulgogi was Ok. Lastly, the Cali roll was ugh. The rice around the roll just didn't taste right. The insides were standard.  I asked if there was a new chef or something and she just responded, we are a bit unorganized today. My parents have been here more than me and said this time was the worst, too, and  we've never had the same waitress... Sooo.. Yeah.  Done with this place.",

The texture of ponzu, scallions, and presentation on iced bed rivals best restaurants with much higher price tags.  A True gem that deserves recognition.",

Like a few others have stated, the service is sometimes not great even when they are slow. I usually order off the Japanese menu but I've had the BBQ and it was pretty good. Also a reason for the three stars is my husband had the ramen last time we went and it made him sick, I'm not sure if it was something bad or an additive in the food. I really love the kimchee and other extras you get when you eat there.",

I decided on one of the specials that included a meat choice and 2 regular sushi rolls or 6 nagiri. I got the bulgogi for my meat choice, then s spicy tuna roll and a California roll. We also ordered the vegetable tempura as an appetizer.  Everything I put in my mouth that night was super yummy! I hadn't had any Asian food for a while and OHYA really hit the spot!  Just writing this review made me crave them, so I'll definitely be going back again soon to try some other wonderfully sounding option on their menu!",

The place was so tucked away that we almost missed it. Parking in the plaza is plentiful.  Inside the restaurant it was very dim and dark. I suppose it's nice if you're in to the whole lounge-modern thing, but to me it just felt like they just didn't want to turn on the lights until it got darker...  My family was a party of at least 12. Service was DEFINITELY slow. Our drinks got refilled maybe once? The staff here spent their time talking to each other at the front desk and in the back than properly serving their customers.  Food was decent. My aunt ordered for everyone so I can't tell you the exact items we got, but everything was mediocre and nothing was that flavorful. Fried rice, stir fry noodles, bulgogi, pork belly... I think the best thing we tried was the sashimi and cucumber salad which I wish was a bigger portion.",

I know it's a little thing but it's a big issue in the Phoenix heat to have to go out to your car to change your baby and I imagine it's a simple fix for the restaurant. Would love to go back and find this resolved.",

I'm actually quite exited about this place since its so close to home and they have private karaoke rooms for reasonable rates. Not as cheap as in LA, but it will do. I ordered their Ramen, it was tasty. The broth was a little on the sweet side normally, I'm use to a more savory taste, but it was good! Also good portioning size as well. This will definitely become a go to place for us now.",

Usually, the food is so good that the mediocre service isn't even an issue, this time however the food and service were just not up to par with how Ohya used to be. The service starting off was okay, we got our drinks quickly, but after that we didn't really have a particular server, we had to keep asking random servers that passed us for things like, refills, napkins, sauces, lettuce, etc we didn't even get rice with our meal until we asked for it when usually it just comes. We had to ask for the check and ask for the check to be picked up. It just seemed like no one was available to help us with anything. Ohya would be 5 starts for sure if the servers and staff were just trained more. The food wasn't what I'm used at Ohya, the  was cut into weird triangles that weren't good at all, it was way too thick and took almost the entire time we dined to cook and be crispy. Everything else was perfect though. I'm sorry I had to leave a review!!",

The kalbi portion has got to be the smallest beef entree I've ever gotten anywhere.  I felt like I got robbed eating here.  Definitely didn't get what I paid for.  Never again!!    Also, the Kalbi wasn't marinated very well, it just wasn't very tasty.  All the side dishes were of the poorest quality.  Kim chi wasn't good.  This restaurant has dropped down to one of the worse Korean restaurant I've ever been to.",

My yellowtail sashimi was subpar(connective tissue in every piece) and the roll I received was incredibly mediocre like something you could pick up in a grocery store. I don't think it is the fault of the sushi chefs. They did a wonderful job but you can't make magic with bad recipes. The waitress also forgot my husband's order. When we confronted her, she said that the chicken teriyaki takes much longer to cook then the beef teriyaki which someone else at the table ordered(30 min longer??). Everyone else at the table had received their food long before and were almost done eating. We all saw her go straight to the computer and enter in my husband's order after I said something. She would not own up to her mistake and was rude about it. Had she just apologized I would have been more understanding. The second star is only because the sushi chefs made a nice presentation of everything. It's not their fault they have crap servers, materials and recipes to work with. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

When the food finally came out, we were not offered any utensils. I mean NONE! So my fiance had to go up to the bar and grabbed the chopsticks, napkins, and straws himself. We also needed a spoon that was not provided at the bar so we had to flag down a waitress which was no where to be found. The portions are small and way overpriced. We also needed refills for our waters....and never got it. We ran out of water half way through dinner and never got a refill..even though I flagged them down again and asked for a refill.

The hostess didn't know where to seat us and then once we were seated, I looked up and the waitress was in the back, on her phone, PICKING HER TEETH! She then flicked her food particle in the trash, didn't wash her hands, and started to check on every table BUT ours. I am so disappointed because this place was once so delicious and the service was AMAZING! I will never return to this place. It is unsanitary and extremely unprofessional.",

    "text": "Love this place. We've dined in several times for lunch/dinner and have also ordered takeout many, many times. Great selection of hot dishes (our go to is always the daeji bulgogi) appetizers and a wide variety of sushi offerings. Our faves include the sonoran roll, mango pop and the gangster. They have a decent sake (hot and cold) and beer selection. They also have happy hour specials that run all day during the week.  If you dine in during lunch, take advantage of their amazing lunch specials. Two people can easily share a combo (choice of meat with sides and a 6 piece roll) and walk away happy. Also, the majority of tables have a grill in the center so you have the option of grilling your own meat if you'd like. Always fun for a date night or with a group of friends! They have a full bar (about 10 stools) and a sushi bar (both with televisions) and can accommodate large parties. Staff has always been friendly and helpful in explaining the menu (much of which is in korean).  Best thing about this place is they are open late. Real late. 1 am M-Th 2am Fri and Sat and 11 pm on Sunday. Need a late night fix? This is the spot. And again, get the daeji bulgogi. You will not be disappointed.",

The fern in my hot stone bowl was improperly cooked making it bitter and bland, the bowl lukewarm and the food is well, to reiterate, meh.   Go to the Scottsdale location if you want good authentic food.  This location is a pass and we tried it twice before we left a poor review.   First trip was a 2.25 star meh.

This used to be me and my friends' spot for Korean food but for the past few months, the food, the staff and our over all experience went downhill.   Last night I think is the worst experience we've had. Su was our server, the place is about 60% busy, she and Kelly and another busser was there attending but it seemed like service was very slow.   We ordered the Bulgogi and Tofu Soup Regular Spicy combo, the brisket meal and asked for more sides.  The bulgogi came out dry and bland, and the most frustrating part was our soup. It felt like we were served spicy, hot water with orange food coloring with meat in it. We had to tell our server and she took it back to the kitchen and she said she will get us another one. And then 20 minutes later, we followed up with her and she said \"it's coming.\" Another 10 minutes, our friends were done eating, and still no soup so we told Su that we were just gonna pay for the bulgogi and to just cancel the soup because we've been waiting for half an hour and already lost our appetite. She answered back \"but it's ready!\" and insisted that we take it into a to go box but we refused because got frustrated with her attitude and lost interest in the soup.   It took her another 15 minutes to run our payment and to get a glass of water.   I think this place just needs more training on how to treat customers and have some consistency when it comes to how they cook their food. I really wish this restaurant would improve because it does have a lot of potential and we really like the Tofu Soup a lot!",

This was the third time I ate here and it will definitely be my last. I ordered a combo with samgyupsal, dwaeji bulgogi and kalbi. The samgyupsal was extremely thin with zero flavor, and the same could be said about the kalbi. About 70% of what was brought out was bone. Yes, I know kalbi has bones and it enhances the flavor, but I didn't pay nearly $40 to eat bones. The dwaeji bulgogi was OK and it at least provided enough to fill me up a little with the rice. I'd give the taste of the meats a 2/10, the serving size a 3/10 and the service a 7/10. To the casual diner that enjoys Korean BBQ, this place may me enjoyable to you, but for me, who knows what good Korean food should taste like, I wouldn't eat here again, even if the meal was comped. Next time I'm craving some Korean food I'll make the extra drive down to Mesa, Tempe or Gilbert because at least I'll feel full and the food tastes better.",

This is the third time I have ever eaten at a Korean restaurant and I it felt authentic.  From the wooden benches and tabletops to the lightly decorated pieces of art and plants, it felt like a mom and pops' place. The front signage CHK light was either off or not working.  I ordered Nakji Bokum mild.  It is a stir-fried octopus veggie dish.  It came on a sizzling platter and although the veggie assortment (mostly jalapenos and onions) were a disappointment, I loved the octopus.  The white rice was served in a personal-sized metal bowl, which was unusual.  It was really spicy, beyond what I could take, but downing a few glasses of lemon ice water quickly restored the flavors.  Complimentary sides (spicy cabbage, regular cabbage, broccoli, lotus root in heavy syrup, yams) and were always refreshed and the waitress was accommodating.  I give it a notch lower because of the higher price tag and apparently, mild means a bit on the spicy side for them.  Korean food is not my thing, but this place is good for Korean food enthusiasts.",

    "text": "I'll preempt this review by stating that I have no concept of what authentic Korean food tastes like.  I've had a few home-cooked meals, but when it comes to Korean restaurants, my exposure is limited to Chuhgajib Korean BBQ and Takamatsu.  I personally don't care too much about food's authenticity, for me taste reigns supreme.  For example, I prefer artificial strawberry flavoring, but hate actual strawberries.  That being said, I'm not well-traveled enough to tell you how authentic the food is.  All I can tell you is that it's always been a good experience and the food is very tasty.  The atmosphere and staff are welcoming.  Some tables feature built-in grills so you can cook the meat at your table (it's fun once, but I'll let the cooks handle it next time).  As a former waiter, I would cringe if I had to babysit some guy trying to impress a girl by using the table-top grill.  But, on a recent date, the staff was more than helpful with doing just that.  Despite my best efforts I had a hard time finding the sweet spot between thinly sliced raw meat and charred ash, and I have a feeling other restaurants might have been less appreciative of me smoking up the place. :)  As a tragically un-hip white guy, I've been to a lot of ethnic restaurants where I've felt uncomfortable for being unfamiliar with the cuisine or customs of that region, and I never felt that way here.  Like most Korean places, every meal is kicked off with a slew of mini appetizers, which I believe is called banchan. Some are fantastic, some are ok, and some I could skip out on (I'm not a fan of kimchi so I can't tell you if it's any good), but it's free so at the very least you can get a lot of different tastes even if you only order one item.  As for the meals, I just stick to BBQ dishes.  The spicy bulgogi is my favorite, the meat tastes like it's infused with the seasoning, and it's got just he right amount of kick.  The regular bulgogi and the chicken are also good choices for your first visit, and they have a few combo deals so you can try different meats.  Avoid the pork, it was practically inedible, very chewy and fatty.  One last note:  The boba drinks are ok, but consider getting one afterwards at Pho Avina next door, they have more flavors, warmed-up boba \"balls\", and the sealed cups you have to stab with your straw.  Other reviewers seem to think that the only reason this place is getting good reviews is that those reviewers have a limited perspective on Korean food, and that there aren't many options in Phoenix.  That might be True, but my guess is you wouldn't be reading this if you lived anywhere else, and if that's the case then your Korean food exposure is likely similar to mine and so are your options.  I'm sure there's better places out there, but you'd likely have to board a plane to find one.",

    "text": "Overall a big blech...  Is this is the best Korean food that Phoenix has to offer? No way.  I grew up in L.A. and spent my childhood going to Koreatown and know the real deal when I see it AND taste it. This ain't it folks.   Went there with the family on a Groupon - Initial impressions were not so good. The place looked semi-clean, and a young Korean couple next to us seemed to be picking at their food rather than eating it. So I asked them what they ordered and \"was the food good?\" and they sort of both rolled their eyes without much enthusiasm and the gentleman shook his head firmly side to side while looking down... not such a good omen right?  Oh Boy.  We ordered the Bulgogi, the spicy pork and the ribeye steak. The meats were generally fatty and not thinly sliced - they also did not taste like they had been well marinated (the Bulgogi).   The Ribeye was leathery tough and super fatty (even for Ribeye) - the meats overall needed a good trimming before being brought to the table. I've had better meat at Sizzler.   The side dishes were also just so-so, very one dimensional as other reviewers have pointed out. Really disappointing as the sides can be one of the best experiences at a good Korean BBQ in L.A. or San Francisco. Not here though.  One concern was the \"tough as beef jerky\" Ribeye was served as whole steaks, and since there were no knives at the table for after the meat was cooked...we requested a serrated knife and fork.   The waitress then suggested that \"why don't you just use that scissors\" as she pointed at the food scissors that she had previously used to cut some of the raw Bulgogi up before cooking. I responded by saying that \"that was used on raw meat - probably not a good idea,\" to which she giggled and smiled and went and brought something to cut up the jerky - er beef - with.   Would we return here? Never.   I will honestly be surprised if this place is open a year from now - Groupons won't be enough to save this place from mediocre food.",

They took the table next to mines check and I got up and walked out. No one said a word my \"server\" just looked out of the kitchen. Never, ever again. I was at table 12, of of maybe 4 on a slow Sunday afternoon. Could the other servers even come check on us? I guess not.",

    "text": "Reading through Google and Yelp, I see the polarization of views...  However, I can clarify this experience for the people who are lacking praise for this fantastic establishment.  My own experience was a first experience.  My wife and I were in the area and I mentioned this restaurant.  We immediately went there.  The people were friendly and the place looked like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant; which excited us as we have always been used to quality being found in such places.  The servers were friendly and gave the proper time to read the extensive menus.  By the way, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff must be weighed by the customs and cultures of the same.  Knowing cultures of Eastern Asia, I found everything to be fantastic.  Then, we thoroughly enjoyed the best sushi that I have tasted since New Jersey.  We also enjoyed some sample dishes of various sides.  The main course was this unbelievably amazing lamb.  I enjoyed hot sake with my meal, found everything to be beyond expectations, and left a fifty percent tip to the waitress.  As for the lamb, we took some home for the kids to try and got them hooked.  It is simple:  if you find yourself doubting this place, then Korean food will not be for you.  If you find the restaurant or staff lacking, you do not know where to find quality and have never been to New Jersey or New York.  This is the type of place where one must visit to find the good stuff.  If you question my scale of standards, understand that I am a harsh critic and extremely finicky when visiting any establishment.  I will be steering many people in this direction and I see many new people every week.  I have already told dozens of people that this is the spot.",

I've definitely had better Korean food, but this is the only place near me that does take out. Also the rice portions are laughable. They really do not give enough rice for the stew. I asked if they can substitute more rice instead of the side dishes and they said no, and will have to charge me $2 extra. Uh, yeah may only come here minimally when I'm really craving for Korean food. There are much better places out there that have better tasting Korean food and serve more portions without charging more rice. Unfortunately they are all out on the East Valley or in California.",

I really wanted bulgogi but it didn't come in a hot stone bowel or with cooked veggies so I ended up ordering something else. I was really disappointed about this. We both ended up ordering the bibim bap with the short rib. While we waited for food, the waitress brought out the typical pickled small dishes with sprouts, kimchi, etc. That was good.   When the bowels came out, the food was piping hot with the raw egg cracked on top which what I wanted. The bowl is deep. The meat looked like it was slightly skimped on but I don't know if it is because they take the bones out of the ribs. I prefer my meat bring left on the bone. I mixed my bowel up with the sweet red sauce they give you on the side. There is a good amount of veggies, but I was noticing I wasn't super excited about the veggies in the bowel. It was thinly sliced carrots, beam sprouts, a dark green that appeared to be spinach maybe, and a long brown chewy veggie which I thoight was a root or a sprout of some sort. I was disappointed that there wasn't any cucumber or kimchi or any other more crunchy component in the dish. The meat itself didn't have a really delicious short rib flavor either it just was okay. The texture of the meat was good though; it was tender. Overall, the bowel was okay. I have definitely had way better bowels elsewhere.   Service was good though and the restaurant was clean.",

They seem a little understaff so maybe they need to work on hiring more workers.   Spent a little over 100 dollars for 4 people with combo 5 for KBBQ, and sushi combo. The meats was so little.. for that price you should just wait for their Tuesday special for all you can eat. Meat tasted alright, I've had better meats before. Sushi tasted fresh and good, no complaint. After all, this restaurant is pretty decent. They have great deals once in awhile and it's worth trying. Will come back, but won't come back often.",

We try ordering the pork bone potatoe stew but they were out that night. So we decided to order few bbq dishes.  They have all you can eat bbq Monday thru Wednesday here; however, We didn't want to overeat so decided on galbi, beef tongue, and lamb. All the meat were really tasty and they gave us very generous portions.  The staff were very attentive and came by often to check on us. Also noticed the staff were all Korean as opposed to their scottsdale location.  The nakji dolsot was very spicy and saucy. Although i like spicy food, I would pass on this next time and stick with bbq. The grill is also very easy to control as they have knobs on top of the tables. However, I did notice the grill was unevenly heated. One side was hot while the other side was warm. Once we figured this out, it was easier to cook the meat on one side and move to the other side to keep warm.  Enjoy!",

My tangsooyuk came out soggy and undercooked while my jjajangmyun had maybe two chopsticks full of noodles. Then after sending back my unsavory tangsooyuk they made sure to tack on an 18% gratuity. When regarding the kbbq side the meat quality and prices have much to be desired..  On a positive side their sushi and rolls are not half bad. So stick with the japanese dishes!

Maybe because we moved here from Korea I was expecting those flavors that I had there but it just wasn't at this restaurant. I'm still on the search in the valley for that authentic Korean flavor. With that being said, I'd still recommend this place for those that are beginners to Korean cuisine. We also ordered the (mini) mango macaron ice cream sandwich, very tasty!",

I don't usually post a review that's not positive, but this needs to be stated.  The food was far from authentic as it had been in the past. Examples: the rice was noticably not fresh like it was day old rice that was reheated, the kimchi SoonDuBu didn't taste like SoonDuBu but tasted like tofu was just added to Kimchi Jigae (there's a difference), the Udon was overly overly salty, the chicken bulgogi seemed like an Americanized version of chicken stirfried in soysauce. I'm honestly baffeled by the change in quality. If you're looking for authentic Korean, you won't find it here at least at the moment.",

    "text": "UPDATING THE REVIEW AS OF 12/30/2016 - FROM 5 STARS TO 2 STARS:  We have been visiting this restaurant for more than 8 years, before their name changed to Ohya.  This place is no longer the same ever since the Scottsdale location is opened, because the owner, Chris stops visiting this location.  This restaurant at Glendale has been going downhill for more than 2 months.  We thought we would see improvement but so far it's only getting worse.  Their Korean BBQ meat is no longer fresh.  Cups and plates are often dirty as if they are not washed at all.  There is also a supply shortage issue as if they no longer keep their inventories checked.  It looks like Chris is about to abandon this restaurant, so time for us to find a new Korean/Japanese restaurants nearby.  I have also removed some of the photos I posted on yelp, as the foods do not look the same anymore, or no longer available.  End of update.  *This review is for hardcore foodie who is not bound to Americanized-Asian food.  I have tried this restaurant numerous times and I must say I am usually quite satisfied in terms of the value, ingredients' freshness and food varieties.   What I like:  Ingredients - Fresh raw seafood consistently.  I haven't been disappointed so far.  This is one of a few places that actually serves fresh sweet shrimps (raw shrimps) and do it right.  Skewers - They are awesome (in most cases, not always, see below).  Beef tongues and chicken gizzards are my favorites.  Service -  Never have problems, friendly and efficient.  Happy Hour menu all day everyday!!!! - Do I need to say more? ;)  What I don't like:  Preparations - It seems like they recently got a new sushi chef that's still in training.  The preparation and the cutting skill will require significant improvement.  Therefore, even when the ingredients are still fresh, the meat tastes like \"dead meat\" for those who know what I mean.  Skewers - They used to be cook-to-order, which takes a long time and it's understandable.  I suspect the skewers are now pre-cooked in order to achieve faster serving time.  Overall, I will still keep going there on a weekly basis!!",

It might have been something to do at least once in your life or if you're in that kind of thing. Maybe it was because our table was so tiny for a table for 5? There were no room for our food. It was fun but the food was mediocre, including sushi. It seems kinda pricy too for cooking it ourselves. Idk I've had better in Cali. Our server was good and kept asking if we need anything but I think she came up to our table a little too many times. Super nice though.",

I haven't seen my friends for a really long time and we are all sushi lovers so I was hoping to have a nice night with them and try a new place  we arrived at 7:00 and was seated at the tablet by the window next to the Bar, we literally waited a whole hour for someone to come see if we need drinks.  and then wait for about 15 mins for the water and drinks to arrive. Finally then we got the menu.  I noticed that they got all you can eat sushi on that night! I was really excited to give it a try , one of my friend is pregnant so she is trying to eat healthy, she doesn't want to do the all you can eat (understandable). But then we were informed that the whole table have to all get all you can eat or no one can. I was not too happy about it but oh well I'll get something else..a little later, my friends got their order in but I need a few more second so I told the waitress to put in their order first (So my friend don't starve to death) and come back for me.   Then I wait....and wait....and wait...finally! the food arrived before the waitress return to take my order.   At the end, I have to literally go to out there and hunt down a waitress to get our bill.  This is my first ever Yelp review~I don't usually like to write things online but this is just too bad of an experience for us all~ Honestly, do yourself a favor and do not go there",

    "text": "For an easy and quick review read this part. Pros: 1. Place has the atmosphere. Great place to drink I bet. 2. Very clean place. 3. They run some lunch specials. 4. They give 15 percent off. 60 days expiration  Cons: 1. If you're not familiar with Korean flavor stay away  2. Most of the food we ordered is lacking something, there is just that missing flavor. 3. Pricey- I think this should be between 3 to 4 price.  4. A bit rude customer service and slow at the same time. (More on the review)  If you want some detailed review keep reading. I came here long time ago but wasn't using yelp by then. We had a bad experience \" a small friendly critter was on one of our food.\" I was a bit skeptical to come back here but let me put it this way, that previous incident did NOT in anyway affected my review. I was even open on trying everything. And when I say Everything I meant everything, even the sides that most of my colleagues didn't want to touch.  LET me try to do my best to individually give feedback on the food we ate. First the their most tipped food the bulgogi, it was too sweet for me. Just little onion and other than the sweet flavor I didn't tasted any other flavor, however my colleagues stated that I should had tried the pork bulgogi. Teriyaki chicken was lacking in flavor too, even though the meats were soaked with so much sauce. Chicken katsu was so bland, if you have tried any decent hawaiin place that has chicken Katsu, you will understand what i mean. Fried chicken that looks and feels like from Church's , crunchy but covered TOO much with flour. They also have sushi. We tried the Vegas roll  and the tempura. The tempura tasted good. I think that's the only reason why I liked the place, thus the one star. The vegas roll however did not do good on my taste buds. So little flavor. Lastly I also tried the different sides, the only thing that was okay was the cabbage.  So that's for the food's review.  Continue to read for miscellaneous part of the review. The service was quiet odd because the guy who was helping us was a bit slow. He also wanted to make sure WE knew that it was a Korean place when we asked for condiments that they did not have. The price also was a bit on the high price, felt like we dine on Scottsdale when there was only 5 of us and we paid on the high hundreds.   The only thing I could add is that they have a good atmosphere.",

    "text": "We ordered BBQ combo #7 which includes spicy pork, chicken, pork, beef, short rib, steak, pork belly, squid, and beef brisket. We also ordered some beers and two soups -- kim chi stew and bean curd soup  FOOD: 2/5 The meat was decent and plentiful for about 5 - 6 people. The meat quality was pretty good. What gives it 2 stars are the soups and beer. I have no idea who cooks it back there but it does not taste like what it is supposed to taste like.  This is not only the opinion of just myself but also the opinion of 3 other Koreans I was with. The kinchi stew was over powered with pepper flakes and hot pepper paste. The bean curd soup was missing something buy we couldn't figure it out. We did manage to scoop out a glob of bean curd paste that hadn't mixed in well with the soup. That may have been the mixing ingredient.   The beer -- when you order a beer keep in mind that it is a large bottle not the usual 12 FL Oz bottles. One bottle is enough for two.   SERVICE: 5/5 The service was pretty good. The lady was very attentive and made sure to stop by frequently to ensure we were taken care of  they were quick to replace all the side dishes and came by to explain the menu thoroughly till we were satisfied.   COST: 4/5 The cost was decent but slightly on the pricey side especially given the quality of soup.   DECOR/FACILITIES: 4/5 Very clean inside. The bathrooms are also clean. I did not like the electric grills but they do the job. Because it is electric grills, the pans take a little longer to heat up and is easily cooled when meat is placed on top.   Overall, this restaurant doesn't really highlight itself as a GO-TO restaurant. I honestly wouldn't bring anyone new to korean bbq here as it doesn't really have anything special or unique about it. I'm reluctant to give it a 3 star. I would want to give 2.5 but 3 is what I will settle with as the meat was somewhat decent.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to give Ohya Korean restaurant a try since Tuesday is AYCE Korean BBQ and sushi for $24.95.  The restaurant was packed as expected and we had about a 25 minute wait before being seated.  Once at our tables, we started off with the Korean ribs for grilling and a couple of pieces of sushi.  They limit you to only one sushi and one raw meat order per customer per request.  While I understand they're trying to cut down on waste, this is very inconvenient for those of us who do not waste food.  Rather than hindering the majority they should charge any customer who waste food an extra charge.  Then only those who violate the rule would be penalized rather than all customers.  Now the review of the quality of the food and service.  Food: The AYCE sushi menu is very limited compared to other similar establishments.  And when they bring out the nigiri sushi, it's limited to only one piece rather than the traditional two.  The maki rolls were very small in diameter and count.  As for taste, I'd rate them as okay with a few in the 'good' range.  But certainly nothing extraordinary.  The AYCE Korean BBQ taste was mediocre at best.  It wasn't bad by no means but it lacked the flavor that I'm accustomed to from other Korean restaurants.  On a side note, the grills in the table are electric heated rather than natural gas therefore there are no flames.  The electric heating elements takes a long time to adequately heat the metal grill so your raw meat cooks very slowly in fact too slowly.  And without the flames from a gas fire grill the meat lacks the charred texture and taste.  Service: Our waitress was friendly but very slow.  While I understand it was busy that night, I compared her speed and efficiency against waitresses serving other tables and I'd have to say, I'd wish we were seated in a different section.  On several times she didn't show up for 15 or so minutes, either at our table or the others she was servicing.  Thankfully, the manager \"Po\" is very attentive and as he walked around the tables he would personally take our request and check on things for us.  Po really made the service experience of our visit much better.  Overall I'd rate Ohya three stars out of five.  We may go back in the future when its not so busy and if we do I'll provide an updated review.",

My go to Korean is Cafe Ga Hyang, and I wanted to try something closer. Also my coworkers talk about this place having amazing Korean food.The staff was friendly or at least my server was. The others seemed to be involved with the baseball game that was going on. For starter I had Duk Boki, which was disappointing cause the sauce tasted like something I can make at home with the packet you can buy at a Asian market. I also ordered the three oysters special. I asked where the oysters were from no one seemed to know. I still ordered them cause I was enthusiastic about this new place down the road from me. When I ate my first oyster, it wasn't properly cleaned and I swallowed some of the shell. So my next two oysters I cleaned them with my drinking water. They weren't bad. I was bummed cause I washed off all the sauce that came on top of the oysters but I couldn't risk swallowing more shell. My dinner was a Korean hot soup with intestines and tofu. That was decent and had good flavor, which saved this review. I'm hesitant about going back to try something else. For now I will drive a little further for much better food and experience when I am craving Korean.",

    "text": "Without attempting to unfairly compare this place to \"LA-Style\" places, it just fell flat in my opinion and was overpriced (my opinion again). Though the meat is fresh, the electric grilles for the cook yourself aspect just don't compare to regular grilles and you don't get the full selection you would normally see in a traditional Korean BBQ (though they do have many types of food).  Hot sauce/sriracha is an option rather than on the table and on a busy night that took a while to get. There are also no steamed egg soups here or rice paper (I believe that's what they're called). The customer service nonetheless was great, multiple waiters would check on us and maybe just once I had to \"call for attention\". I will perhaps change my review when I eat there on one of the all-you-can-eat nights, but I'd still give 4-4.5 stars at best. It would be great if the all-you-can-eat nights were more than twice per month. As of now though, they're the best around so far in Phoenix (that I've tried).",

She moved us to another table with one broken grill table top. We got 6 waters for 12 of us. Waitress took our order and then walked away but we still needed to order more. How are we supposed to cook Korean BBQ with broken grill tops and feed these kids. Ohya is not able to accommodate to a big party. Horrible customer service, will not go again. Maybe if you have a party of 2 you will be able to eat. Never again!  0 stars!!!",

It was hard to decide what to order because their was so much selection, which is awesome! In the middle of your table they have an inset grill. I looked over to the table on my left to notice a party of four having fun grilling up their meat on it, it did smell great.  I also noticed a tv by the bar that had cute pictures displaying photos of their signature sushi dishes. I wanted to try everything after seeing some of the art of these dishes, everything looked so good. I was in the mood for some sushi.  Well finally I ordered the spicy tuna roll off of the signature menu, and my husband ordered 3 different rolls off of the traditional. We also ordered an appetizer of an egg roll.   The egg rolls were so yummy, we scarfed them down.  Then the sushi started rolling out.  Wow we ordered a ton of food. I really liked everything.  My two favorites were the signature spicy tuna roll, and the tradition Salomon roll.  All was excellent though. We will be making this our new favorite sushi stop.  Next time I want to try a hot dish, just because everyone else's food smelled so great.",

He can make anything you ask for in the spot, no problem. Their happy hour goes on all day, which is great. They have awesome deals on both sushi and drinks. Their Cherry Blossoms are delicious!! I've spent both my birthday and anniversary here because I love everything they make. I've NEVER had a bad experience here, and my hubby and I come by quite often. It's just great food, great people, and great times!! Friends have come to try it out after my raving and they are now regulars too.

After an hour and 15 minutes they seat us at the table that was open the whole time!!!! Didn't even bother to ask what we wanted to drink, and just brought us waters 15 minutes later. We asked for some sodas and both the coke and Dr. Pepper were flat, as if it was an old 2 liter bottle.... Took our order and brought our food 30 minutes later... We never got any side dishes like the other tables there.... The grill ended up going out half way through cooking the meat, took them 10 more minutes to come to the table so we could tell them the food was not cooking. We had 5 guests (one was a 2 year old) and they only brought 4 bowls of rice. They tried to charge us $24.99 for a 2 year old ?? On top of all that... We ordered a spicy tofu soup as soon as we sat down and after an hour we still never got the soup. After all this happened we were just ready to leave. We ended up telling them that we no longer wanted to eat there and that we would pay for the food we had gotten. Which was really only enough for 1 person considering it was \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\". They tried to charge us full price for 5 guests and for the soup that we never received. Tried to give the white blonde girl the benefit of the doubt that maybe she was new but after talking to another employee she had been there for a while... Absolutely horrific experience... Will never return and will definitely spread the word about this awful place!!! Would leave 0 stars if I could....",

    "text": "Lunch today found me in major exploratory mode. I decided for no reason in particular that I wanted Korean food. Now, working where I work, this took some sleuthing, but then I found a potential target, Chuhgajib, and decided to head out that way.  I then asked two of my colleagues if they wanted to join me.  They're vegetarians.  Vegetarians in a Korean restaurant? This might be problematic, but I told them, \"Uh, sure! There'll be lots of things for you to eat!\" I think I sounded convincing, because they still came with me.  So we head out towards one of the many stripmalls that Glendale is blessed with and enter the joint. Packed with a lunch crowd, including many Korean people (a real good sign), we had around a 10 minute wait before being seated at a giant teakish table. I ordered the bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated bbq beef) lunch special, while my veggie cohorts got the bi bim bap (a rice dish with topped with sauteed and seasoned veggies) and the veggie yakisoba (not so Korean, but at least he could eat it). As we waited, we were given regular bowls of salad and then several bowls of banchan (Korean side dishes) - pickled radishes, random assortment of seaweed, bean sprouts, potatoes, sliced marinated lotus root, and of course, kimchi (spicy fermented cabbage).    I looked at my colleagues, who never had Korean food before, nervously, but to my surprise, they both took a good liking to the kimchi, enough so that it disappeared long before our entrees even got there. The rest of the banchan was good, and I noticed that the tables were equipped for folks to grill at their own table if they chose to. Given it was lunch and most folks were in a hurry, no one was grilling, except one table which used it to heat up their broth of something or another.   Eventually our entrees came to us, and honestly, the two veggie dishes looked awesome, especially the bi bim bap, which came in its own hot stone pot filled to the top with good stuff. The yakisoba looked great, too. My bulgogi looked kind of sad in comparison, just a bunch of shredded beef on a plate with three California rolls (?), but it still tasted great.   The service was very acommodating towards my vegetarian colleagues and the hostess/owner was very interested if they enjoyed their meal (they did quite a bit - although they faltered with and soon gave up on using the stainless steel chopsticks). We then ended with dessert - bowls of sikhye (a chilled sweet rice soup) which made for a refreshing end to our lunch.   To close, you get for $10 (including tax & tip) a feast fit for a king. I'd definitely like to come back with a few carnivorous friends for a full-on Korean bbq dinner sometime (I'll save star #5 until then), but until then I'm satisfied that another great lunch option has been found on this here west side of town.   4 solid stars.",

    "text": "Went to Pho Avina (which I could easily recommend to anyone) a few weeks ago with my 2nd dad and he spies the Korean BBQ place (note their signage all says Korean BBQ and not Chuhgajib) and he grabs a menu and we make note to ourselves to check it out (of course, not until after I checked out the other reviews on Yelp)  So we head there for lunch today.  Now, I know this about Korean food...I ate kimchi made by the mother of one of my daughters friends and it was good. Beyond that, I know that when I flip on LPGA on television to watch the hottee Paula Creamer, some Korean chick is depriving her of a victory and I am none too pleased but it does appear that they understand food...but I digress.  Lunch specials $ 4.95 - OK...I'm suspicious. Includes 3 pieces of california roll, salad, rice, vegetable and entree. Too cheap.   We order gyoza and egg roll appetizers. Evidently gyoza in Korean restaurant is different than Chinese restaurant but is scrumptious nonetheless. Egg rolls more typical to my expectations and very tasty - I'm optimistic. Tea is in big weird cup with no handle and waaay too hot to actually pick up but tea bag says Liptons...I'm still suspicious.  Salad, underwhelming but I am impressed with silver chopsticks that work well for me.  Comes the lunch platter... - California Rolls, AOK  - big mound of white rice, perfect - pickled vegables, tasty and interesting - sweet/sour vegetables, tasty and interesting...wishing someone could tell me what it was I was eating but hey, it's all good. - meat (I had bbq pork but forget the name) mildly spiced, nice, a little dry but that may have been intentional...my knowledge of Korean clearly fails me here. 2nd dad got bbq beef and it was very tasty, not spicy, much more moist.  We left stuffed, happy amazed that lunch could be so good and so cheap.  Place was packed and it's obvious why. Inexpensive, tasty, no disappointments and very clean.  Woman who ran the restaurant wears sneakers and reminded me of a track star because she handled a packed restaurant but hardly seemed to work up a sweat and handled a bunch of to go orders as well.  I have to say...49th Avenue and Thunderbird, two excellent Asian restaurants practically side by side and you can't go wrong at either place.  You can gorge yourself for $10 here. You could drink water and have a $6 lunch that puts a Big Mac to shame.",

I have been a frequent diner there myself. They have a variety choice of item in the menu, the prices seems real reasonable and decent portion. As most korean restaurant these days, they also offer serveral item in their menu that is not common korean dishes such as katsu(deep fried pork or chicken).   I'm not a korean food connoiser, however, everytime when i was there, you will surely see a few korean that eat there. So i assumed that's a good sign. I would definately say that it's a great place for small gathering, small family dinner or for those who never tried Korean food before this would be a great place.  By the way, if you don't find the restaurant name along the strip mall, it's because all you will see is a sign that says \" Korean BBQ\" flashing on the wall.   One more thing, when i was enquiring a few Korean friends about the name of the restaurant, they told me it was \"Chuhgajib\" and i really thought that they said \"Cho-co-late-chip\" .. lol ok.. it's not funny .. but it's an internal joke...",

The way I pronounce it, it sounds like 'brothel house' in Korean, it's suppose to mean the wife-side parent's place I believe.  (Please let me know if I am wrong)  My girl is Korean and loves going to this place and I've grown to love it!  I personally love the stone bowl that the bi bim bap comes out in.  Keeps the food hot though if you don't mix it... the rice gets hard on the bottom.  It isn't obvious if you don't eat it often.  the other thing I usually get is the T12 (or whichever it is with the BBQ pork and choice of tofu soup).  I love the BBQ pork, it can't be found in many other Korean places and it's unlike anywhere else that has it... so warning to anyone else who has had it and change your expectations now! The Tofu Soup I get is always the seafood and extra spicy, I like it that way... wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice.  Unfortunately, the food is not cooked consistently... I can tell when the older lady cooks the food or someone else does.  She's clearly the better cook and I didn't give this place a 5 star because of the chance where I don't get her and the food is disappointing.  Last of all, the price is great, it's a well priced Korean place (especially lunch or happy hour) and my favorite Korean in the valley because I can afford to go back.",

We had tuna poke salad, tuna, scallop and sweet shrimp sushi, gyoza and California rolls for appetizer. For main entree, we had bulgogi and pork belly on the grill, hubby had bibimbap and our daughter had a teriyaki bowl. From this visit Bulgogi and bibimbap along with Tuna poke salad get 5 stars while pork belly and California rolls get 3.5 stars. It was probably the way we grilled them but the pork belly was too tough. Bulgogi is definitely the way to go. To cook meat on the table you have to order at least 2 meat orders. 2 orders can be easily consumed by party of 2-3.  I really like the new, updated look. Music was upbeat and friendly and attentive staff made our visit enjoyable. We definitely weren't disappointed with our choice for dinner tonight! We will be back for sure!",

The air in there was so thick and smoky as a lot of people were grilling. So my date and I left and decided to come back another time.  A couple weeks later in November 2012, we came back on a Saturday night and the place was a ghost town! What happened to everyone?! It was my date's first time actually being able to sit down at the restaurant, so we decided to stay. We ordered Ddobuuki, Bulgogi and Galbi dishes. When the food came out and was placed on the table, I knew why no one was there...  First off, I remember the Dukbokki, Bulgogi and Galbi dishes to be bigger, the size has changed but the price has remained the same. Hmmmm. The Bulgogi was bland and not fresh. The Galbi was too fatty and not at all what I remember it to be. The only dish that tasted the same was the Ddukbokki. The only upside was the side dishes. Alas, they have not changed one bit and were just as tasty as I remember. They have the best Kimchi in the Valley, but sadly, the Kimchi couldn't save our experience.  On a side note, I've been happily eating at this establishment for the past 4 years or so and have always had a great experience until my last visit in November of 2012. My experience prior to this was in June or July of 2012.  I may be back in the future, but since I've discovered Yume Sushi in North Scottsdale, which serves amazing Korean food, I doubt that I will be.",

    "text": "Got to try CJB today and man I'm a happy camper. We bought a deal of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbuywithme.com&s=6c130683ae3777a5916aa1d5aea104cee52a5208c3e3c1531a39b02e3f8686d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">buywithme.com</a> where we paid $15 for a $30 certificate. It's great because we normally to to Korean BBQ in Mesa, but this place is now my new favorite. We started with an order of the Gyoza (4.95) They were lightly fried, crispy and just perfect. Paired that with a large Korean OB Beer ($6). We decided to go with BBQ combo #1 that came with bulgogi, daeji bulgugi (somewhat spicy pork) and Dalk Gui (grilled chicken). These are actually the three things we usually get, so it worked perfect. The combo was $30 and easily enough for 3-4 people, with the panchak (mixed side dishes) and rice. The bulgogi was awesome, super thin and great flavor. The Dalk Gui was pretty good, just seasoned chicken. The piece de la resistance was absofrigginlutely the Daeji Bulgogi. Now this is always my fave Korean BBQ dish, but this ranks up with the best I've ever had. While it did lack some of the heat of other Daeji dishes I've had, it made up for it in flavor and just overall awesomeness. The grill they had there was unlike anyone i'd seen, it was better when I had them crank up the heat and let it warm up for a bit. it was this odd round grill thing, but definitely did the trick. We finished the meal with a Coconut boba. All total, using the coupon we ended up dropping a whopping $28 with tip. Even without the tip, it still would have been a hair over $40 which is great. Killer service, great atmosphere and rockin food. Great to have a new fave Korean BBQ spot in the valley",

Its a fun place to hang out and chill.   Food...   Well its a bit on the lower then average.   Im not sure how you can mess up duk-guk (rice cake soup)  but they cant seem to cook soup.   Even the edamame was inedible.   Food is also very expensive for lacking so much flavor.  Its like someone off the street trying to make Korean food.   The quality in taste is not their.   Service is descent.   Although they have 17-19 year olds that dont know the menu very well and have to constantly ask the owner or manager what we are ordering.   We've been going their for about 2 months now and they still dont know whats on the menu... O.o   Just a little suggestion...  Take the menu home and study it...",

Upon entering the first thing i noticed was the furniture made of trees. It's really different and fun! I cannot remember what we ordered but first we were served 6 or so small white bowls with cold vegetables. I was not impressed, although the cold potatoes weren't vomitous. Then came the sizzling strips of beef and THAT was delicious, some of the best tasting strips of beef I've ever devoured.  I would say if you like Korean food, you would enjoy this place. I am not a fan of Korean food but I would eat those strips of beef anyday.",

I'm a long term valley resident, and have been a fan of CGJ Korean BBQ and Pho Avina since their beginnings at the shopping center across from ASU West.  I've tried the other Korean restaurants on the west side (Takamatsu, Seoul Korean Grill) and don't think they compare. I love the tofu soups, the bibimbap, and side dishes (my favorites are the lotus root--when they have them, and the sweet potato salad). I also like the fact that this is a small, intimate family run establishment as I prefer mom & pop restaurants to generic chains.  I would recommend getting a normal menu entree as opposed to the lunch specials on your first visit. The lunch specials are priced cheap for a reason, and don't give you a good idea of the quality & flavor of real Korean food, plus you don't get the delicious side dishes.",

I had the bbq sampler platter that included galbi, samgyupsul, and another meat that I can't seem to remember sorry! I have nothing bad to say about the sampler except that there is not that much meat included and that the samgyupsal is kinda flavorless (except for the ample amount of pork fatty goodness).  I also had the pork kimchi pancakes which were okay, kinda flour-y tasting though. Again lacking on the flavor side but they make up for it (kinda) with a super super salty sauce on the side.  They offer boba and while I was there they were buy one get one half off. I got the green tea boba with no boba and it was okay. Nothing spectacular, I actually prefer Starbuck's green tea frap but I digress. My friend ordered the coconut and it was very watered down. So there's that.   Overall, I would go there again. It's a fun dining experience and nothing beats grilling some fresh meat with some great company.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I am writing this in anger over recent events.  Maybe in a week I would rate my experience as 2 stars.  Tonight, however, 1 star is generous.  Prior to Chuhgajib's expansion I went often, even as a student on a shoestring budget.  Back then, it was small, cramped, and smokey, and yet I would have rated it five stars.  The staff was friendly, and the food was incredible.  Now, Chuhgajib has renovated; they offer more than double their original tables and a bar area, and have staff to accommodate their growth.  Unfortunately, the service of the additional staff leaves MUCH to be desired.  This brings me to tonight's visit and the reason for this review.  I was part of a party of four.  We did not make a reservation, but when the other couple arrived at 6:50, they were told we could have a BBQ table at 7:30.  We met them and stayed at the bar.  The new sushi offerings are fun; they have unique names and combinations, and we all enjoyed them.  Around 7:45, we were still sitting at the bar while two BBQ tables were being cleared off.  A group of six came in and was seated at two of the BBQ tables with little to no wait at about that time...while we were still waiting for a table.  The server that had been keeping us abreast of our wait time went over to the other server, and shortly there was a small group talking, pointing at us and the group that had just been seated ahead of us.  At this point, we no longer existed as far as the staff was concerned.  No water refills, no updates on our table,  no \"Is there anything else I can get you while you wait?\"  We couldn't even get eye contact with a server.  TWENTY MINUTES LATER, over an hour after we had arrived, we flagged down a server and asked what was going on.  At that point, we were told that there was a mix up and the other group had a reservation ahead of us.  If that was the case, they were at least twenty minutes late for their reservation and their reservation should have gone kaput.  If it was an accident that they were seated in front of us and no one had the nerve to unseat them, someone should have admitted to the mistake.  Even that would have been okay in my book.  But the staff at that point simply decided we didn't exist because no one wanted to be accountable for us being stuck at the bar and not eating the BBQ we had come for.  We were told at the same time that another BBQ table had closed out and the staff was waiting for the party to leave before seating us.  Well, at 8:10, there had been enough waiting.  We got the bill, paid, and only left tip because a dollar in change wasn't worth any more waiting on the meek and irresponsible servers.  My disappointment is a reflection of how excited I was to see Chuhgajib after its renovation.  Sadly, the staff does nothing to overcome the extremely poor service.  We received a discount on a future purchase, but that means nothing when I never plan to return.  It's time to experiment with other Korean BBQ in Phoenix.",

I felt that the Kim Chi as well as the red pepper sauce were spicier than Cafe Ga Hyang and they also offer the option to BBQ your own choice of meat unlike Cafe Ga Hyang.

    "text": "I'm a first generation Korean American, and I worship the food my grandmother used to make. Alas I only learned a few of her recipes before she passed and it's really hard to find what I need to make good old fashioned home cooking.  So instead I go to Chuhgajib Korean BBQ. It's a tiny place that has a homey feel right down to the TV playing bad Korean soap operas in the dining room. Most of the servers speak english but there are a couple who are harder to understand, it's called authenticity! At least you know the food is being made by, oh my gosh...Koreans!  Ok as for the food. My biggest test is always the tempura. Most Japanese restaurants in the valley have failed miserably at this, being too oily and heavy. Here the tempura is light, crispy and not at all greasy. Almost as good as grandmas, and I don't say that lightly folks!  Next up is the quintessential dish Jap Chae. Glass noodles tossed with veggies a touch of meat and sauce. The jap chae served here is a little saucier than what I'm used to but delicious all the same!   You must try the BBQ, a big plate over propane in the middle of the table where you then sizzle big chunks of meat. Yum. The galbi is well marinated and boneless which is a nice touch, great flavor. All served up with crisp lettuce and sauce to wrap all the tastiness up in.  My only complaint is that the kimchi is a little weak on the spice. I can eat a whole dish and not feel my mouth warm up in the least. It's very good kimchi, not at all rank or sour like other places I've been. But if you are looking for spice you really must assure the servers you can handle it as they are a little wary of people asking for \"hot\".  All in all this is a nice place to relax, grab a good meal that doesn't leave you feeling gross and stuffed. Just happy with a tummy full of good home cooking!",

There are some great things here. One being the fUrNiTUre!!  I LOVE the wooden furniture here. I'm not just talking about normal wood furniture here, I'm talking about huge single pieces of wooden slabs being used as bench seats and seat backs. This furniture is wicked.   The service is good too. The waitress spoke fluent Korean and English and knew what my friend Justin wanted when he ordered in Korean.  We had a few dishes. One of which was kimchi tofu soup. It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.  My friend Justin (remember, he's Korean) actually blurted out, this was the worst Kimchi Tofu soup he has ever had. We also had some spicy pork which was marinated not in the traditional spicy PASTE that is normally used but in a chopped up dry spicy chili that covered the meat like it was glitter. The spicy pork dish was supposed to have some sauce and the meat was supposed to be nice and juicy. Nope!  The dish was dry and served on a hot plate on a bed of chopped onions.  Add soju and a hot fish plate with some diet cokes and you suddenly have a bill approaching $50.   As the Germans would say...  \"Nicht so gut!!\"  So in the end, the meal was summed up by my friend declaring the meal being the worst Korean meal he's ever had.",

The supposed kalbi they give was just bone with fat. BONE with a small slab or fat around it. That's the part that is usually what is left after the real kalbi is eaten. And the jumulok was not even close to what it is supposed to be. It reminded me of jerky with marinade. That meat is supposed to be tender and juicy. Not dry and tough.   We also had the ddokbokkee. It looked amazing but it did not taste good.   To top it off, I got an upset stomach from it all. We cooked the meat well and it was definitely not our cooking methods.

It's never dry, always fresh. I feel their sushi is such high quality that it could compete with or even beat places like Stingray Sushi.  They also just remodeled their restaurant to have a sushi bar along with karaoke rooms!  This is simply the best Korean restaurant around. They're consistent with service and quality. Never once has food ever been delivered that was less than perfect.  They also do to-go orders which can be a quick fix for people on the move!  Overall, I would give this place 5/5 stars. If you're looking for something new that is the next big thing, then come here! You will not be disappointed!",

Pricing here for sushi is extremely competitive and portions were excellent. We ordered 4 rolls and shared them for more variety. I only rated 4 stars because i wasnt very fond of the \"ohya i forgot\" or the \"spider\" roll. They didnt have much flavor. The vegas roll is a staple among sushi and they had one of the best ones I've tried. The volcano roll was also amazing... A hot roll that was melt in your mouth goodness. They even created a volcano out of orange peels and lit it on fire as they served it to your table... An awesome touch! I would definitely recommend and visit again!!",

    "text": "I asked if the restaurant is owned by the same owner as the CJB Korean BBQ place and the owner has not changed, but  the place looks like they are still under construction.  They still have their old sign up and so I was a little bit confused walking it thinking I had to choose a restaurant.  Inside it looks a lot better and bigger.  The tables are equipped with the round grills you use to cook your own meat if you choose.    I had the current special that was only $14.95 and you get to pick your choice of a meat entree and either 2 traditional sushi rolls or 1 of the specialty rolls.  I picked the Kalbi and the Dynamite roll.  I also ordered the assorted soft tofu soup that had crab (imitation), clams, squid, and beef.  The Kalbi (beef short ribs) was pretty good.  When I tried the Dynamite roll, it was excellent.  It really tops any other place.  I also think the soft tofu soup is okay.  Their food is okay and I was delightfully surprised because I had tried the CJB Korean BBQ place a few times and it was the worst out of all the restaurants.  I highly recommend everyone to try this place out.  They have two rooms for private karaoke.  One larger room that fits about 15 people and the other one that fits about 10.  The waitress said that the smaller room was $30 for 2 hours.  After that it is $10 per hour.  The large room is $50 for 2 hours.  You have to order food and they charge a 18% gratuity.  They have Korean, Japanese, and English songs.  The selection is limited, but not bad.    I am updating my review from a 5 to a 4. I love to have my birthday parties here and rent the karaoke private rooms, but the services and food is just okay. It's still a place I like to go to, but I prefer to get my Korean food at Paradise Hawaiian BBQ because it tastes better.",

Since Melting Pot is one of my fave restaurants I was excited.  We ordered the bbq combo #1 which includes pork, steak, and chicken.  We also ordered sake bombers and an rainbow roll.  Rainbow roll was great.  The bbq was decent, although it left a weird coating in my mouth.  There was plenty left over.  We did have a good time trying to cook everything while doing bombers.  2nd time around we had sushi.  Caterpillar, Spider, and Rainbow.  Rainbow and Caterpillar was good.  Spider was okay.  Service was good and bad.  They are super friendly and nice.  They make sure your water or drinks is filled.  But they forget things like utensils and napkins.  Our server also didn't explain how to use the stove since everything was written in Korean.  Even though we told them it was our first time.  We learned when we got our check how to turn it off or adjust the temperature.  No wonder it was hard to keep our meat from burning.  But they were so friendly that I can let those inconsistencies slide at a low key place like this.  On a side note:  they do have 2 small rooms available for karaoke parties.  Might be fun to get a group together and do sake bombers while rapping or singing.    I give them 4 stars for now because I enjoyed both my visits.  It is more 3.5, so I grade them a B-",

    "text": "My husband and I just happened to find this place on accident. I looked it up on Yelp and the reviews seemed fun and the food sounded well priced. We came in on a Tuesday because of the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi deal that have going on. One thing that didn't sit too well for me were the Rules to the All-You-Can-Eat deal: the whole party has to do the deal individually not just one person, you only get 90 minutes to start and finish the deal, any sushi left gets extra charged on your bill, no signature rolls, and you can only order 3 times. My husband wanted to order his own thing and I wanted to do the sushi deal but the waitress said he couldn't do...that so we both decided not to do the deal and just order sushi regularly. The drink deals they had were well priced - $2.50 for a pint of Blue Moon every Tuesday - and everyday a new drink is specially priced. So the two of us ordered 5 different sushi rolls and udon noodles. The presentation of the sushi was very pretty and looked professional. However, there were some problems I had with the sushi that I think were more opinion based on my side but I have been eating sushi for years and know the basics of what it should be/have/not have. For one, the rolls were either too big to eat in one bite and fell apart or fell apart just picking them up the first time. My husband's California rolls were so lightly rolled they fell into his soy sauce almost every time and splattered sauce everywhere. My Shrimp Tempura rolls were so big you couldn't eat it in one bite and that made me have to bite it in half and thus making the roll fall apart. There was wasabi in the Avocado roll which was a bit strange and in all the other rolls there was lettuce wrapped in. I have never had a basic sushi roll with lettuce rolled in it also - I personally was not a fan of it. The udon noodles were ok but nothing amazing. The noodles themselves were a bit hard and you only get one small shrimp tempura stick on the side. The best thing we ate here and we're really surprised about was the Miso soup. My husband and I lived in Korea for a while and the Miso soup there, which was awesome, tasted just like the one we had here. I will definitely be coming back for the Miso soup. The restaurant itself is very clean, entertaining, and seems very modern in that it caters to the younger 20s crowd and that's great - but in my personal opinion for the amount I spent in sushi there I wish the sushi was a little better.",

I was a huge fan of the food and I really did love the huge wooden tables they used to have. I am grateful the place didn't totally disappear, but I did prefer the old restaurant to this new one. Thankfully, the quality of the food doesn't seem to have been affected.  The new location has much smaller tables which makes grilling harder. Also, the grill isn't gas anymore, it seems to be infrared or something that takes a long time to heat up.  My favorite dish on the menu is the melt-in-your mouth beef brisket. Paper thin slices of this meat are served partially frozen for you to grill table top. Be sure to grill this right away because when it thaws, it is hard to unroll to grill flat. We also had pork bellies, kal bi, and chicken. The chicken was the surprise of the night! It was so flavorful, I will have to order that again next time I come. We also had a combination soon tofu soup to share. This was really flavorful and I recommend it along with all of the food mentioned above.",

Except to be catered with the up most respect. Mindy is an awesome waitress and she knows her stuff, she never leaves me disappointed! And try their sushi, it's to die for!

There are only two women there doing the serving and yes it is a little slow, I will take slow service with a smile and a good attitude any day.  Now to the main event.....the food. I don't know what they use to season the meat but all I can say is YUM. The Korean salad I could have eaten all day long and still wanted more. The kimchi was perfectly delicious and quite the treat.  Now to the experience. It was fun and drew out people that normally sit in a restaurant and eat with very little conversation. Summary: fun, yum, happy service, a new regular is born.",

    "text": "This restaurant continues to be my go to spot for Korean BBQ since my review a couple of years ago. Every time we go, the restaurant is steadily full with a wide variety of patrons.   You can choose to cook at the table or have them cook for you. Usually we opt to cook at the table but a few nights ago, we decided to have them cook it for us. Same price. Usually, we opt for the $30 combo that has the daegi bulgogi, dalk gui, and the Kalbi. If I said it right, it is the spicy pork, chicken, and short ribs. That is more than plenty for the 3 of us...leftovers are the best! This last time, we each ordered a spicy pork plate at $13 each (my favorite and I don't really eat spicy food). I felt like we looked like gluttons when the food came out. Very good portions.   I also love the panckak (sp?) they bring out with various items to enjoy with your meal. My 5 year old demolished the white radishes and I had to fight her over the bean sprouts. So good. As always the service is friendly and attentive. I have been to other Korean BBQs where if you aren't in the same culture, you aren't treated the same. Not so with CGJ. I always enjoy my meal here. Inexpensive and delicious food.",

The sushi \"chef\" literally ignores you and wonders off to do other things besides make sushi! Other places allow you to have 5 ordered at a time which make up 10 nigiri. This place loves to torture you with only 2 pieces!  What difference does it make to them whether I eat in 30 minutes or I am forced to take 2 hours!!!! They are only making there customers angry and unhappy!! Stay away if you don't want to leave disappointed and angry!!! According to the waitress they are more concerned with preventing college students from cheating there system than they are with keeping customers happy.  Update: the sushi chef literally sat down behind the bar and started doing something on his phone rather than make my 2 pieces of sushi! Crazy!!! See photo!! The waitress was wonderful and attentive. It seems she has to defend the restaurant policies from many angry customers. She should be manager! Wow! The owner threw me out before I was finished eating. Evidently yelp alerted him as soon as I posted.  Note to other customers: don't yelp until you leave the restaurant!",

Not to positive on the time, but I know I arrived at the establishment at 6:48pm... and did not get my food until 8:00pm. I say to myself, maybe because it was a big order... but then I look around and the place is NOT busy, and they are serving the guest with raw meat so it can be grilled in front of them So why did my order take so long?!?!  2. We decided to sit at the bar because they said it would be a small wait. Within that hour wait, no bartender or server ever approached us. We had to track down a server to get her to the bar to take our drink order. After that, she checked up on us ONCE! And that was to give us our bill for the drinks.   Pro:  1.  Server remembered us from our many past appearances at this establishment  To sum this up now, was the wait worth it??? I am going to have to say NO. The food was not worth the wait.",

    "text": "This is one of those reviews that just has to be written. This review is for delivery through GrubHub. (PSA for GrubHub Customer Service, they REALLY don't care.)  We order about $120 worth of sushi/sashimi. My first mistake - ordering sushi as delivery in AZ. Second mistake - not canceling the order when it went from a 1-hour wait to 2-hour wait THEN to a 2.5-hour wait. I called the restaurant at the 2-hour mark since my hunger and curiosity was peaking. The wait staff explained to me that the delivery was heading out the door right then and there and would arrive shortly. I google mapped it, 7-min ETA. Ten minutes pass by - no delivery. Twenty minutes pass by - no delivery. Around 2.5-hours after we placed our food order, the delivery driver shows up and shares that he heard the conversation between myself and the wait staff and didn't understand why they told me he would be there so soon. The delivery driver shared that he had merely left the restaurant 7 minutes prior. Either the restaurant staff has a very different understanding of time than I do OR they merely told me something to shut me up. You decide.   We ravenously attacked the sushi rolls and sashimi since we were assured the food had just been made and driven over. Never in a million years did any of us think, \"are we all ready for major bathroom explosion fun-time?!\" WE ALL GOT SICK. Not just a little sick, but full-blown Bridesmaids Brazillian restaurant going to try on fancy gowns scene sick. Those poor bathrooms.   Don't make the same mistakes we made - skip the delivery and just dine-in, but be forewarned your belly may rumble.   P.S. our order:  Gyoza, Macaron 4pc, Yellowtail Scallion Roll, Eel Cucumber Roll, Spicy Yellowtail Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Sonoran Roll, Dragon Roll, Sashimi Combo a, 2 Piece Fresh Water Eel Sushi, Vegas Roll, Meat Jun",

Trust me when I say this because I love spicy foods. I do not recommend getting mild for this dish if you cannot even handle sriracha or Tabasco. The dish had white rice on the bottom, cucumbers and little squid on top. It had a red spicy sauce over it and also hot chili oil. The dish comes out sizzling in your plate. Overall I would say this dish is 7/10.   The tofu soup here is really good. I believe it was in spicy but it was not spicy at all! I'd give this one a 9/10.  Now for my favorite of all... The baked scallop sushi... OH MY GOD this roll is yummy! It is a bit pricy though, it was like $3 for 2 nigiri sushi. Well, I guess for Arizona you cannot complain since we are in a desert.. However, from where I'm from (a island in the pacific), they sell a whole roll (8 pcs) for $12. 10/10 would recommend the baked scallop.",

I've tried most things on the menu and found most to be very good.  The Karaoke room is an added bonus,  fun with a group of friends and family . The service is nice and friendly, especially Sue, she will go out of her way to make sure everything is just right.  I'd recommend this as great place to eat.",

The young waitress didn't even want to give us side dishes since we only ordered two dinner entrees.  And we didn't order Korean dishes.  FOR GOODNESS SAKE YOU ARE A KOREAN RESTAURANT !!! When we asked for our Favorite potato side dish, she said they don't have it.  And later she brought it to the table next to us.  Don't think we will be back again.  If that's how they treat their customers depending how much they spend !!!",

    "text": "Tucked in the corner of an older strip mall, across the street from ASU's West Campus, OHYA Sushi Korean Kitchen delivers solid Korean BBQ at a reasonable price. It's a nice little place for food and conversation....as long as you don't mind the abysmal service.  I've been to OYHA several times over the past year - my son likes the Korean BBQ grill - but I've never been there for sushi (Frankly, the seeing the words \"Sushi\" and \"Korean\" together in the establishment's name is sort of a turn-off) and I've never been there for karaoke (I...ah...nevermind), so this review is strictly based on my experiences with their Korean BBQ.  The atmosphere is casual and the though they've managed to cram as many tables into their space as possible, half-wall dividers do a nice job maintaining some level of privacy. The walls are adorned with wood planks that used to serve as tabletops. Their new tabletops now feature electric grills, which I guess they assume don't require smoke hoods. I've never had an issue with smoke there, so I suppose they know what they're doing.  On to the food - They have a nice selection of meats to choose from. Note: When ordering BBQ there is a two meat minimum. We usually opt for one chicken (dalk bulgogi) and one beef (bulgogi or galbi). You get a decent amount of food and between the two of us we are usually stuffed. Along with the meat, you also get steamed white rice and a rather disappointing array of side dishes. Whenever I have Korean BBQ, I always look forward to the side dishes - here, not so much. First of all, there are only six, mostly bean sprouts and kimchee. Secondly, the kimchee has never really tasted very...fresh (yes, I know it's fermented cabbage and it's supposed to have that old flavor, but it's just not what I usually expect.) Anyway, the food is pretty good (depending on how my son cooks it ;)) and we usually leave very satisfied.  The main problem is the service. The service is beyond bad. With the large number of tables they have, during the lunch rush I have only seen one waitress working at a time. One. The last two times we were there, we have seen multiple parties get seated, then walk out 20 minutes later after never getting served. This seems to be a common occurrence. Yes the service is bad. The last time we were there, we had to ask for rice and a fork multiple times before we finally got them. I don't really blame the waitress here - I blame the management for not ensuring that the shifts are adequately staffed.  Anyway, I give the food 3 stars, minus 1 for the service. Come here for the food. You'll enjoy it. Just don't come if you're in a hurry or expect even marginal service.  Enjoy!!",

We were pleasantly surprised to receive rice bowls for all entrees (even the noodle dishes) and 6 great tasting side dishes. Our waiter even went out of the way to make a toddler straw cup by puncturing a straw over plastic wrap on a plastic cup. Service was prompt.   Only thing is that the galbi was pretty thin and burnt a bit but all the dishes were delicious (especially the tofu soup). There is also no ventilation which created a smoky atmosphere from the grilling at the other tables (my parents complained of itchy watery eyes from the smoke). But overall we had a good experience!",

Perfect. ..It was so good, we went back and was shocked to see the place packed. On Tuesday's they have unlimited sushi for $22.00 and for like 10 bucks more add in unlimited Korean bbq. Too much for me to undertake but we were in the minority.  Came home and bought another Groupon. Can't beat the deal.",

    "text": "I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, and I thought this was exceptional. I already liked the Korean food at the predecessor C J B Korean establishment and now I have a new favorite place for sushi as well.    Black suspended tile ceilings with dark concrete floors, walls of bright green and some modern oriental art in between. Slightly spare, clean, modern feel to the place.  Men's room was spotlessly clean, modern with up to date fixtures, stocked with all the necessities.   Our young server was friendly and attentive and our water glasses never went dry - except when I bumblingly knocked mine over, which was taken in stride by staff, and quickly replaced with a fresh glass. Service, from being seated, to order taking, to delivery food, to delivery of the check, involved no undue delays.  In fact, as Norm R noted,  service was almost too efficient as servers were anxious to whisk away our plates almost before we cleared them, but I'll take that over that experienced by another reviewer any day.  Now as to the FOOD, Excellent in every way.  Beautifully presented, multiple distinct flavors. Best shumai ever tasted. Tongue tantalizing tuna tataki, rich, red, flavorful, and our accidental order, the \"OhYa I Forgot\", was a definite \"no regrets\", the closest thing to a dessert sushi I've ever encountered with its touch of peach.    And finally, we didn't go away hungry, indeed as one should not from a $65 + tip meal for two, but you need not spend nearly so much.  There are considerably reduced happy hour prices and several \"chef's surprise\" samplers at under $20.   The service we received was \"comfortable\", perhaps more friendly than polished, and that's just fine by me.  I highly recommend with the hope the service you receive is as good as we got, and not the indifference experienced by another recent reviewer below.",

I think this place is especially different only because they serve noodles and soups besides just meat like other kbbq places around the valley do. I can't really get jjajjangmyeon anywhere else besides here, unless it's at asiana market all the way in Mesa, which is almost an hour drive for me.  Needless to say, most everything is pretty good. Not amazing because I've had some inconsistent experiences with the food, even with some of the same dishes. I've had my noodles taste great on some occasions, and on others they've left a strange taste in my mouth. The bulgogi is nearly always very good though, and you can never go wrong with their kimchi and other side dishes.  The service is usually not too bad, but every once in a while the waitresses seem to forget my table exists. It seems like whenever I'm waiting for a check, food, or something else that might get me impatient, service takes longer here. But sometimes it's not a problem at all and service is great. Like I said, inconsistent.",

I have no complaints. Service is always good.   One thing is I got lost finding the women's restroom. Alcohol and me trying to find it isn't a good combo. It's located at the back though and it's the first turn to the left. Don't walk too far or you'll end up being lost like myself.   But yes this is prob one of my fave kbbq places in this area!",

The menu has a wide variety of meats and cuts for traditional BBQ. Tables are set up with the personal grills for those who want the Korean BBQ meals. A whole section of Japanese plate selections. Traditional Korean soups and a wide variety of Sushi from their sushi bar. Plenty of dishes for the mixed party.   We went basic with soup and noodles as you see in the pics. Boom! Delicious. I enjoyed the traditional flavors as I remember from Korea. The south part. Didn't visit the north side. It was a little strict.   I'll definitely be coming back and exploring the menu. I'm sure I won't be disappointed. I also enjoyed the ambiance, kind of cozy.",

However, the restroom is in dire need of fixing and updating. Service was okay, our finished plates were not entirely taken away, just pushed to the otherside of the table.  We ordered the \"OHYA Sweet Plate\" ($12), which had 1 cheesecake slice, 2 macarons (cookies n cream and birthday cake), and 2 mochi ice creams. Unfortunately, the cheesecake and macarons tasted old. We told our waitress and she was nice enough to substitute them with 2 more mochi ice creams.  Overall, it wouldn't be our 1st choice if we want Korean food however, they are close and open late (until 1am Mon - Th) so we might be back because there are limited options in our area after 10pm during the weekday.",

    "text": "So this place is great and all, and they have a fantastic selection of food. However a lot of what I need to say stems from my last visit here. I came with the girlfriend and her friends to karaoke. Not only did the waitress take a long time to take our order, and not only did it take a long time for our food to come out, but right when we finished eating and sang a few songs, the waitress rushed in and handed us our checks and urged us to  quickly leave because the next party that made a reservation apparently arrived and was waiting.  First off, if there is another party, at least give the party that is occupying the room a heads up about time limits, and if there is such a rush, maybe there should be more urgency and purpose when trying to take orders and bringing out the food so at least your customers can enjoy the karaoke room.   Sadly I would rate this place more because the food is fantastic, and the selections they have for food range from traditional korean and japanese food, to newer more modern creations. However the fact that the waitress rushed us and was somewhat rude throughout the evening serving us really put a bad taste in my mouth. I know I should not let that one experience ruin everything else, but even on slow nights the wait staff can be pretty slow here, causing the food to still come out later.   Overall it's a 3/5, if the wait staff can be more attentive and not rush customers, the only direction this place can go is up.",

    "text": "Average food, Okay prices, could be Better!  Was craving for Korean, came across this place through Yelp. Thought to give it a go.  For starters, we had garlic edamame, hot wings, and seafood pancake (extra crispy). For BBQ, we had  Salgapsa- pork belly ( sorry for the wrong spell) and chicken Bulgogi, and Kimchi soup. Pls mind that we were a group of six people.  Out of all the items, my Favorites: seafood pancake and Kimchi soup in terms of taste, portions, and freshness. Now coming to the rest if the items, I wasn't fan of the BBQ because I have tasted ones that more flavourful. They had only 5 sides which included, rice, Kimchi, cucumber pickle, raddish pickle, and  fermented greens. From my experiences there are usually more sides like tofu, spicy potato which were missing. When we inquired our hostess about other sides, she got us tofu, broccoli, and macaroni. Surprised to core to see broccoli and macaroni as sides in Korean BBQ.  The proteins were priced below $20 which is cheaper for a Korean BBQ. May be because of this, they limited the sides. As far as the taste is concerned, I wasn't fan of the meat nor sides.   Despite the average food, I like to mention that the customer service was great. Our hostess was very cooperative and took good care of us. She changed the grill continuously, made sure sides kept coming, and was very accommodating to our needs.  One of the things that really bothered me about this place was the hygiene. Our table was sticky. The floors appeared dirty with black patches. Y'all need to work on this. Just a suggestion. Thus,    .",

    "text": "My buddies and I were hungry after playing some games at the nearby Imperial Outpost games and I remembered off a whim that this place was literally in the same complex. I was there once before and it was good, so I suggested it to my buddies.  Appearance: When you arrive, the exterior isn't very impressive. It's a strip mall and it's really hard to make it stand out. The tinted windows hide the interior.  On opening the door, the interior is quite nice.  Upon entering, the visitor is greeted with a host stand, and behind it a normal bar on one side, and a sushi bar towards the back of the room.  Several tables are placed to the right portion of the room, each with their own grills.  The host seated us at a booth with a couple chairs and we proceeded to order. My buddy had the Bibimbap (fun to say, and delicious) and my other buddy and I had the steak and lamb grill top.   Service: They brought our food out, and it was a little out of order, one of us got our raw meat before the other, and the edamame showed up about the same time. That being said, it was delicious. My friend who ordered the Bibimbap ended up stealing some of our lamb, but that was just a sign of good food.  The waitress came by and made sure we always had water and beer. She even asked if we wanted more sides. A plus here.  The food: If you go to Sizzle, they cook the food for you, and the food is of the utmost quality. If you come to OHYA, the food is tasty, but it's definitely not the same caliber.  On the flip side, you could escape OHYA spending about 40$ and include a tip. Sizzle, you would be hard pressed to do so.  I recommend the Beef and the lamb was really tasty too.  So ultimately, would I recommend this place? That would be an absolute yes. The food is tasty, the service is good, and having a grill at your table is a unique experience.",

The server tried to sneak gratuity on the bill. Understandably, there is an automatic gratuity when there is a party of 5 or more but I only had a party of 3. Initially, an itemized receipt was brought over, which the total bill was ~$42; however, when I received the credit card slip that needed to be signed it magically increased to over $49. When I requested the itemized receipt again, I could see the server's discomfort. The new itemized receipt that was then brought over had the line item 'Gratuity' with a $7+ charge added to the bill. When I brought this to the attention of our server, she said sorry but was probably only sorry because she was caught. Who knows how many times I have been duped at this place prior or how many other people have been improperly charged. Definitely keep an eye on your itemized receipt and reconcile it with your charge slip!",

    "text": "My husband and I tried CGJ for the first time tonight! It was so good!! We bought K2 and K3 which are the bbq marinated beef and spicy pork. Since we ordered two dishes for the bbq, we were able to grill it on our table. We also ordered a soju to share :) and I ordered a coconut boba drink. We decided we liked the marinated beef more than the spicy pork because it tasted better with all of the sides they bring out. The spicy pork was very good though too (the other ingredients just got lost in its flavor). If you haven't had Korean bbq before, you grill the meat you select then wrap it in lettuce with your side dish selection.  As we left, my drunk husband said, \"This is the only way to eat lettuce!\" At first it was a little intimidating since we have never had Korean food before, but the waitress made us feel very welcomed and was very attentive (but not in the annoying way). I can't wait to go back and try something else!! :) Also, prepare to be full.",

    "text": "We are in town for the week and came onto yelp looking for places to eat for dinner. We decided to find some good korean restaurants. We were originally planning on going to Seoul Jung but called and the number was out of service and 411 said no restaurant existed. I believe they are out of business. So we went searching for another korean restaurant and this restaurant had good reviews. We also checked out the menu as well and decided to give this place a try, even though it was 20 miles away where we're staying, we're glad we came!  We were debating between doing BBQ style or ordering individually. We decided to go individual. We ordered the Kimchi Chigae, Galbi Dolsot Bibimbap, and Daeji Bulgogi Soft Tofu Combo [got the Seafood Soft Tofu], and OB to drink. The ahjumma brought out some salad to eat, which was lightly marinated with some sesame oil and soy sauce. And then our banchan's came out. The banchan was pretty good, but we've had better banchans in cali. [To True L: there are refills the banchans. just ask her for more.]  The Galbi Dolsot Bibimbap came out first and it looked really good. My Mr loved how it tasted. We've had bibimbap at many korean restaurants in socal, and he thought this one was the best he's tasted. My Daeji Bulgogi combo came out next, and the Bulgogi was very nicely marinated. That was very good and not dry at all. The Seafood Soft Tofu was ok, but the seafood taste and scent was a little too strong for me. My sister got the Kimchi chigae, and she loved it, so did the Mr. The Kimchi Chigae soup was nicely balanced between the spicyness and sourness. I think a little spicier would've been great as well!   They open till 10pm which seems to be pretty late for Arizona. Thank you to fellow yelpers for the recommendation!",

I think the pre-cooked meats (both kalbi and bulgogi) are dry and taste like they have been cooked earlier in the day.  Tofu soup is always good even though I like cracking my own egg in it. hah The Pa jun was my favorite, because it had scallop, calamari, clams, and even shrimp!   Overall, I'll give it 4 stars, but I'm being really generous here.  (mainly because I'm korean)",

The pork was nice, but the beef should never have reached our table. Awful. A smokey place (kinda fun there) that leaves you feeling like a Boy Scout just returning from a two week jamboree in the woods. Yeah, I remember that. Same thing. You might want to do laundry right after the dinner. I've been to a few Korean places in town and probably would not go back to this one. Yes, it's homey and mom and pop, but after that beef bbq attempt, uhhhhhh.....no. Not again.",

    "text": "Some of the best Korean food I've had east of LA! Me and my boyfriend decided to check this out after reading the reviews here and I am so glad we did.   I ordered the galbi dohlsot bibambap and kimchi pa jun, and he got the daeji bulgogi and pork tofu soup. I've had all the dishes before and I have to say they were all very good! the kimchi pa jun was definitely the star of the meal for me. The bibambap was very good (I really liked that they included egg, not all places do), but I can definitely say that my favorite restaurant in LA had better, same with the daeji bulgogi (I actually think that Cafe Ga Hyang over on Olive and 43rd Ave had a better daeji bulgogi - more expensive but a lot more meat, and they didn't skimp on the sauce/marinade, which I felt they did here a little bit). They also didn't serve complimentary barley tea with the meal which was not a huge deal but I always enjoy having it with my Korean food. Price was very good too, only about $40 for a rather large amount of food. If we'd gone for lunch it would've been pretty cheap, from what I could see from their lunch specials, so I'll definitely be going back for that! Service was very quick, and I enjoyed the variety of Korean tv programs they had.   All in all, not comparing to food I've eaten in koreatown, it was a delicious filling meal and fulfilled my korean food craving and then some. Definitely recommend it!  I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "First off, I would actually rate this place 4.5 stars, not just 4.  I don't like beating around the bush and talking about things that don't have to do with why we go to most restaurants, the FOOD!  The restaurant itself was very clean and nice.  This was my first time here, and I moved to AZ about a week ago. I went in for the lunch special, which was an awesome deal for what I got and how everything tasted. Its 4.95 Mon-Sat which is great to include Saturday.  I ordered take-out and just finished the meal. I ordered the beef bulgogi. They give a LOT of beef for the money. They included 2 side dishes. Unfortunately, they did not have the fish cake side dish, no problem though. They also ran out of california rolls which come with the meal (which is already a great deal without the rolls) so they substituted two fried dumplings which were good. I kinda wished they put the beef on a bed of white raw onions, but the cabbage was fine and the beef was really good anyway.  I also ordered a bubble tea and asked if it could be made as a milk-tea and NOT a slushie (I don't like the slushie versions that most places serve). She asked in the back and said they would do it. The drink came out tasting great and was not ridiculously over-sweetened like most places do. Overall, I will definitely be going back here to try the many other things they have on their menu. I've eaten at many korean restaurants around the country and this is a really great place.",

We had a young baby and she wanted to seat us in the middle of the room... not a good idea. 1 person running around + Sleeping infant seat on a chair. I see bad things happening. She wasn't thrilled when I wanted to sit at booth.  She allowed it though.  They were out of the Yakisoba I originally ordered. No problem, we moved on from that. I ended up ordering a dish that usually comes with meat..which apparently could be made with out but switching meat for tofu was a no go. I don't really get it since tofu is much cheaper but I guess not adding tofu and just using veggies that would have originally came is even cheaper...but still...  The noodles veggie mix ended up pretty bland, but luckily my stir fry came with a bunch of cold stuff I could add to my hot meal. The lotus root was a new try and tasty. I added that, seaweed and bean sprouts to my noodles and bland veggies.  Fiance liked it, but I don't think this will be on our favorites lists since the vegetarian options are few and far between and substitutions seems to be an issue as well as seating. It was a neat experiment. They are very decently priced and I agree with other reviewers that the furniture is lovely..just not a great place to be a vegetarian",

The octopus was super tough, which I realized later, must have meant that it was frozen before preparation.  The Bi Bim Bap came without rice, which I had never seen, and barely covered the bottom of the bowl.",

    "text": "I had a date here last night, I am huge korean food fan. I actually introduced my friend/fellow food adventurer to it in the first place (see my last review) When we went to hodori. I will compare Chuhgajib now.  Ambience: About the same as Hodori. Did have more interesting furniture as they has these huge natural wood booth thingies...they also had table top grills which we didn't use because I was feeling lazy.  Service: The server was friendly and attentive without being hovery... This is what I prefer Only things I notice is... she didn't refil lany banchans ( i dont know if that is policy?) and We didn't get a check..we had to just walk up to the register ( again don't know if thats the norm here)  Food:We ordered the T 11 ( I believe) Bulgogi and soft tofu soup (we got the combo with squid mussels etc) my date didn't care for soup. I liked it alot aside from the squid ( which is just me) We ordered it regular spicy and it was fine for my wimpy self.I love how it comes out boiling. The bulgogi was excellent I prefer it to hodori was not dry and the flavor was good. We split one combo because we are both very light eaters.All the sides were good except the potato was either underdone or old. I think the portions are smaller here in general than Hodori as far as meet goes(which is perfect for us). The wine was the only let down. We expected the some milky-served in a bowl-with a ladel- goodness and we got a sealed commercial bottle. The wine itself was fine and a bit stronger than the wine at Hodori but I prefer the wine at Hodori. I like presentation. So In short i would say, the food is better at Chuhgajib( and a little cheaper) than Hodori but the win was not as good. I will be frequently both these spots for their relative strengths.  SPECIAL NOTE: there is no Chuhgajib sign... its in the strip mall and just has a korean BBQ sign.",

The combos are a good start if it's your first venture into korean food, although I will say that if you really like spicy spicy food, ask them to make the soondubu (tofu stew) spicy! it's really mild, and while it isn't my fave soondubu, it's pretty good. I usually get the galbi/soondubu combo. Their galbi tang (beef short rib soup) is also pretty good, and is CHEAP at $8 (usually 10+ at other places).   Anyways, for all you ASU West students, I'd recommend coming here for the lunch specials (11am-3pm).",

    "text": "Happy hour sushi all day!!! Who has that? Such a great place for fresh fish for a phenomenal price! They have a combo of both Japanese and Korean food and of course both are delectable. I pigged out on the deiji (pork) and the dalk (chicken) grilled meats served with the lettuce, spicy flavored Korean paste and loads of garlic - for a garlicky breath to fend the unwanted! We used the open table grill to cook the meats got a fresh BBQ, and munched on the side dishes. Bulgogi (beef) soft tofu soup was also served at your spicy-liking: mild. Also had to devour the fresh salmon and yellowtail nigiri. Minus the multiple servers and confusion and missing of the food here and there for a table of 5, the dinner was quite enjoyable. They also have Korean pop music going on in the background with their karaoke rooms! Maybe they might venture to open one on the east side of town??",

The atmosphere is still youngster up beat and fun but the quality of food is so much better. So I would say they have succeeded at focusing on what they had to improve! I suggest getting the Korean Fried Chicken A.K.A the real KFC! Lol. With the sauce on the side. I don't know what is their secret and I don't even know even though I am Korean, their Korean Fried Chicken is very very close to what I used to have in Korea!  I cannot wait for another karaoke night there. Thanks!!",

    "text": "Having dined here multiple times, I can conclude that the level of quality in their Korean dishes is sub par.  I had high hopes that they would deliver great tasting Korean dishes but having had some great places in Cali, it's just not the same.  Maybe I should scale down my standard when it comes to Phoenician Asian dining? Of course.  Sadly, I've enjoyed their sushi a tad more, but not that much more.   On certain nights, the place can either be close to empty or respectably \"busy.\"  The service is nothing to write home about.  Sometimes they will come by and ask how things are and fill your water cup or sometimes not at all.  This is just one of the few areas that can be improved upon.  Despite all of that, they do have something cool that some folks might enjoy and that is Karaoke! From my understanding, if you come to dine, they will give you the first hour free.  The rooms look great for hosting a get together.  You have surrounding speakers and screen to satisfy your singing crave. Haha.  The overall decor is modern.  It has a clean finish with LCDs playing K-Pop music videos.  The Sushi Bar has sports on, so that's perfect for game day!  Luckily, I live close to here, so if I need a quick Korean fix, I wouldn't mind making a return.  Perhaps, I'll host a Karaoke event one day as well.",

    "text": "I come from Orange County where Korean BBQ places in OC and LA don't come up short and I feel I have a pretty dang decent grasp on Korean BBQ, so finding a place since moving to Phoenix for KBBQ makes me oh-so-happeee. I've tried a couple other KBBQ places in the Glendale/Phoenix area, and this location (Ohya) is the only one that seems to have a good fun atmosphere, bek se ju, and all-you-can-eat nights. Although Cali places have the all-you-can-eat every night, I'm not understanding why places in Phoenix haven't adapted this concept (and for $20 per person at that and free green tea ice cream!).  Anyways, the first table we sat at - the grill wasn't working so the server moved my friend and I to a working grill to eat BBQ (not a problem). She was really nice about it and got us waters right away. The pricing is a bit much when they serve such a small amount of meat when ordering off the BBQ menu. We ordered brisket and bulgogi and the brisket would suuuper fatty. I've never seen such fatty meat. I felt like saying \"want some meat with that fat?\", and considering how much fat there was instead of meat, it shouldn't be priced what it is! The tofu soup I ordered at medium spicy and it was very sour and I never got an egg with it! I won't be ordering that again...  I can tell they cannot accommodate large parties, because they moved two different groups around to different tables and had to squeeze them in - and many of their grills weren't working. It was like playing a game of musical chairs & tables. This location is right across from ASU West campus tucked in a little shopping strip. We didn't have any problems with service, except a few times we couldn't get a hold of our server to order more drinks but it's understandable when a flood of peeps come rushin' in. Overall during this visit, service was good, the side dishes were good mainly the spicy cucumber and kimchi, the bulgogi was good, but the prices were a bit much and the meat was really fatty.   UPDATE: So on 12/8/15, I went to their all-you-can-eat bbq and sushi night. Let me just say, I will never return again for the Korean bbq portion, maybe if I just want all-you-can-eat sushi. They charge $21.99 per person for just sushi, and only $25.99 for bbq and sushi per person. They limit what you order for bbq each round and they only give you 90 minutes from the first moment you place your first order. Once you reach the 90 minute mark, you're no longer allowed to order anything else. During regular bbq nights, they give you six sides and lettuce or salad, but for all-you-can-eat they don't give you lettuce/salad and only give you three small sides (no fish cake, no potato, no bean sprout). The meat portions are half the size of regular bbq (which was already a small portion to begin with). Our server Brian was super nice though...he hooked us up with a salad lol.  If you want to order nigiri sushi, they only bring you one piece per order and they limit how many things you can order per round. Also, they charge $10.00 for a bottle of soju. It was the most disgusting soju I've ever had and I've had some pretty bad soju. Stick with beer, sake, or hot sake. Lastly, if you don't finish everything you order, they charge you extra on top of what you're already being charged per plate that you don't eat. (This is understandable for all-you-can-eat sushi, but not bbq. That's ridiculous.)   Recommendation for the restaurant: Go to K-town in Los Angeles and get some pointers on how to run a Korean BBQ restaurant - or even Korea where they have an entire buffet and charge $20-25 per person and you can pick whatever you want from the buffet as many times as you wish. Also, please stop buying such fatty meat. I felt like that's all I was eating was fat instead of actual meat (bulgogi, brisket, galbi). And stop charging $10.00 for crappy soju. I can get soju at a street vendor in Seoul for cheaper than that and it tastes better. Also, have an option for people who just want all-you-can-eat bbq... if LA and OC can do this daily and give larger portions and not cut the sides down in half for only $20.99 per person, I'm sure you can too. Just saying.",

    "text": "My very first dip into KBBQ was with CGJ, and I hadn't been back in years since its rebrand to OHYA til a few weeks back.  I am a walking social disaster and double-booked dinner plans with two separate groups of friends last night with OHYA being the first of two venues. Afraid to cancel on either, I sucked it up and tried to go for a lighter meal here. Aiming for the lighter bite was futile as I ended up grabbing a Caterpillar Roll, multiple bites of my friend's galbi, and waaaay too much banchan. That damned daikon always reels me in. Inevitably, I ended my meal way too full and had to mentally rally for the next dinner, at Oregano's, on the other side of town immediately after. Also the scent of marinated meat really stuck to my clothes and probably made for a strange and stark contrast for everyone within a 5 foot radius at an Italian place.  Overall, I was pretty pleased with my recent experience here. I've maybe been spoiled over the last few years with some more solidly stellar Korean places (in Rochester, of all places), but that's not to take away from OHYA's quality. The marinated meat options were as solid as I remember them being from days of CGJ yore, and the addition of a sushi portion to the menu while not particularly inspired was chill. VERY interested in the karaoke since I was short on time and didn't get a chance to make the push for it. Will definitely be coming back in the next few months.",

When we got here, there were other patrons waiting in the TINY wait area by the front door and the hostess didn't show up for over 10 minutes, even though there were 4 groups of people by now.   We order the BBQ combo for 2, and a quarter of the way into grilling, the grill breaks. They offer to move us to another table, or fix the one we have.   Are they going to work in repairing it while we're sitting here? Are you kidding? We asked that they grill the food in the kitchen, since other people seem to be having grill issues as well.   15 minutes later, and after asking the waitress what's going on, they FINALLY bring out the BBQ.   it's chopped up meat that cooks in 2 minutes!

Let's start with atmosphere, since in my book it is the least important aspect when I'm looking for good Korean food. Yet, Ohya really has a great look and vibe! I love the solid wood benches and tables, and the decor is tasteful and clean.  The service we experienced was superb. A couple servers attended to our needs, and did a great job at making us feel welcome.   Now. The food. Can I just ask, \"Why does almost every Korean place in America put a FRIED egg on top of dolsat bibimbap?\" But have no fear: Ohya does it right and gives you a raw egg so it can bind with all those yummy veggies as it cooks in your bowl. Thank you, Ohya. I must say, the Galbi dolsat bibimbap was superb and I can't wait to have it again.  I also had some tuna sushi and my wife had a couple rolls. These too were all amazing. In fact, since we've been back in town it was the best sushi we've had!   See you next time when I think I'll go for some (or a bunch of) bulgogi!",

Added a new sushi bar (all day Happy Hour prices on certain rolls) Added two new private Karaoke rooms (a good selections of both English and K-Pop songs)   Added new furniture and mixed of the old ones. I thought the traditional furniture made the restaurant feel more unique. Added a teppan grill bar.       Quality:  It's not the best fish quality you will get on the sashimi, however if you order the sushi rolls, they aren't too bad.  According to my friend that knows her sashimi, the Sushi roller didn't even know how to cut the fish.  That's pretty sad!  I guess you can fool the people that really doesn't know the difference between sashimi and sushi.  Banchan (small side dishes) wasn't fresh and ever shrink the portion size. I still like the Soondubu (Soft Tofu Stew) combos and Seolleongtang.    Price:  Of course, when a restaurant expands consumer always end up paying for the overhead. The price did go up a bit. They do still have the their $4.99 lunch special.  Thumbs up for the Owner!    Service:  One day is good and another time is horrible.  It really depends who you get. Very inconsistent!     Hours:  Yay, finally another Korean place opening late on Friday and Saturday until 2AM. The best hangover stop!",

It's based on the number of people eating that determines the # of selections at a time and then there are only X number of rounds (Sushi, I believe it's 4 and Korean BBQ it's 3...but don't hold me to that).  The food was ok, my biggest concern was the raw meat they bring to you with only one set of tongs.  Personally that's a health hazard, thank the stars we got an extra set of chopsticks.  As for the taste, everything was seasoned/marinated well.  The sushi was fairly decent (that's why I raised their stars to 3.  It's worth it to try on their all you can eat nights, just to try the various meats.  The service was good too, our waitress was really patient as we tried to figure it all out and was helpful.  I'd go back, just not on an all you can eat night.  The restaurant itself is fairly dark but nicely maintained and modern.",

I probably would have never came here if it wasn't for the Groupon but I'm very glad I did. Haven't been to a Korean BBQ in years..so I was completely lost. Ended up ordering the chicken, pork, steak combo and started off with a rainbow roll. Man the rainbow roll was awesome!  And then the meat came...wow! The concept it there is a grill bowl in the middle of the table and you cook the meat yourself. Each of the meats were seasoned great and I had a blast cooking it myself. My favorite was the steak. Super good. With just two of us we had too much food. Ended up cooking the rest and boxing it to take home.   Now about the Groupon..our bill came up to $45 and we tried to use our $25 Groupon but we didn't read the find print. It was for $25 of sushi, not BBQ. The one rainbow roll wasn't enough. Most times I would be upset but I didn't care, I enjoyed the food so much I'll gladly come back and order a few more rolls next time!  I actually can't wait till we come back.   Also we had very good service, everyone was really nice. They stay open to 2am, I don't know what time they stop food service at but we were there till almost 11pm on a Friday night. Great place for late night food especially for the west side! I'll come here over a late night chain restaurant anytime!",

    "text": "This place is completely off my list.  The atmosphere is OK as it looks dim and not the best area to wait for a table when they should be on the look out of guests waiting to be serviced.  Even the hostess walks back into the kitchen when she CLEARLY sees there is a line waiting.  Anyway, the waitress sat us down at a table with grill and we ordered BBQ combo for 2 as it was little worth the money plus an appetizer.  You would think they bring out the appetizer first BEFORE the main entree.  Then, we started grilling and about 10 min later, the grill stopped working.  Hmm....guess they don't do enough maintenance on the grills all the time. They offer to move us to another table or fix the grill....why do you offer to fix the grill in middle of dinner?  The waitress took the food inside the kitchen and cook it but guess how long that took.....15 to 20 min!   This was a very disappointing experience for Korean BBQ grill as I had only been living here for 6 months and this place is for sure going down the drain with the customer service they provided and the hostess not being there to greet customers as they walk in.  Sorry, OHYA you lost business and continue to go down no matter what.",

The manager came and brought us two waters and asked \"anything else\" and I said \"oh my friend needs a water\"(she was in the bathroom) and the manager rudely said \"oh I know and walked away\"   We got the waters with no straws and have yet to see the manager/ waitress come back to ask if we are ready to order or have any questions.   We finally got a nice young woman who came back to get our order and asked if we had any questions about the menu.  We ordered Kalbi combo and we cooked it ourselves. The meat was sweet but good. We each got our own cup of white rice and it came with 6 side dishes.   Overall after we got the new waitress and not the manager we ended having a decent experience.  I just wish we had more Korean bbq options in Arizona besides a couple we have.",

    "text": "I came here for my brother's b-day and didn't have a pleasant experience today. This restaurants been open for a while now and the service is always so sloooooooow. I've been here quite often, even before they expanded the restaurant. But eh..  Today we ordered galbi and tofu soup combo, jajangmyun (black bean paste noodles), pajeole (marinated salad) and nyangmyun with galbi combo. They brought out the galbi first and each one had about five pieces of meat on the plate. The galbi was yummy as usual and then my mom's nyangmyun came out. My mom ordered the spicy one and when I tried it it was so watered down so we had to ask for more spicy sauce. My brother then got his jajangmyun and that was just okay. When I got my soft tofu soup, I took a sip out of it and asked the waitress if she can take it back and add more sauce because it was so watered down and had no flavor.   The waitress wasn't korean so I believe when she was talking to the cook, which is the owner of the restaurant. There was a language barrier and so the owner came out and looked all pissed off and asked what was wrong with it. My mom told her nicely that it needed more sauce and what not. Before my mom could finish what she was saying, the lady just walked off. We finally got our japeole and it was way too salty and was just drenched in the sauce. Finally the soft tofu soup came out and it tasted way better and I was able to eat it.   The lady came back out later and asked us how it tasted and we thanked her for fixing it. That put a smile on her face. Overall, I'm not really pleased with the food this time. I've never had anything bad to say about it before but today it was just, let me put it in a nice way..... Very bland.. But before we left the owner packed up some kimchi for us to take home. That was very nice of her.",

Unfortunately after standing around in the dining area for several minutes being ignored by the four workers on duty, with not even a quick \"Hi, we'll be with you in a few minutes\", we did an about face and left.  We walked over to an adjacent restaurant Pho Avina and had great service and very good Vietnamese food.  So my summary is that the food might be fine, but the service probably would be an issue.  Sometimes customer service is king and hopefully this restaurant will learn this.",

We got there pretty early, which is good because by the time we left, there wasn't a seat to be had. The its a pretty small place, with a total of 8 tabletop cook spots and three that are not.   We started off with these firecracker rolls which was a stuffed jalapeno popper with crab meat. They were so good that once we were done with dinner, we order another order of them.  We ordered the BBQ combo # 2 Galbi, Bulgogi, Daeji Bulgogi, which was Short ribs, beef and spicy pork. It comes with a various sides for you to nibble on when your meat is done or while you are waiting for it to be done.   All in all it was a lot of fun. We got to cook our own meat at the table top. The Pork was a little more fatty than we would have liked, but not bad at all. We left out of there full and smelling like BBQ since you are up close and personal. I have a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon so I will be coming back here again soon.",

Luckily, there was only one other table during the time we were there. I got the bulgogi bento box, and the portion size was filling. The bulgogi itself was pretty good. The only gripe I had about it was that it seemed a little grainy.   Overall, I'd probably go back here again. For the price and the quality, it's worth a try.",

    "text": "Ok. I came here because of a groupon special. The first time I went - i didn't end up using my groupon. The \"happy hour\" food is cheap enough, so I saved it. Here's the thing, the food is amazing. It's absolutely delicious. the service was good. However there wasn't many people in the place at the time.. Which is why I decided to go back, and bring my boyfriend.   This second time around the service was epically terrible. So bad it felt like we were purposely discriminated against. We sat down and there was about 4 tables in there when we walked in and then while we were sitting two more tables were sat. So, about 7 tables in the whole place. To start off, she didn't bring the sushi list, which is no big deal except that when I asked her for it she seemed annoyed. So, she drops it off, and then scurries away. We pick our items and it takes her another 20 minutes to come back and get it. After that she brought our waters, 10 minutes later... we waited, and waited, and waited for our 4 items of sushi. All the while, the other tables were getting their silverware, their waters refilled, their napkins, etc. She finally, after another 30 minutes, brought half the order of food over and dropped it off to go attend to other tables. She literally left the food- no silverware/chopsticks, no plates, no napkins, no soysauce dishes.. nothing. So we sat there for about 5 minutes waiting. She didn't return. She just kept running around to the other tables to check up on them.  I finally asked her if she could bring us some plates- she seemed annoyed. She brought the plates and chop sticks... No napkins, no sauce dish. And we were still missing an order. So I got up and got our napkins and our sauce dishes. She saw me and let out an \"OH\" and kept walking. We ate. The food is great. She never once came by check up on us, fill up water, etc.. nothing. Now, this is the shitty part- the food is delicious... like really good.  But the service is crap. So, we waited a while for her to bring the check. It never happened. Even when we were trying to make eye contact it's like she purposely wouldn't look at us. Then, my boyfriend finally did make eye contact and give her a head nod, she still didn't come by. He had to wave her down and ask her for the check.   Now, I don't know what her problem was- we weren't rude. We weren't demanding. But, we did notice that we were the only table that wasn't of Asian dissent or didn't have at least one person of Asian dissent. I don't know if this is just seeking out an odd reason for this lack of service, but I can't think of any other reason. The last time I went was great, granted it wasn't busy. We left her a good tip. So, it wouldn't be anything that has to do with something I've done or we've done. It was just very poor customer service. So, because of that I will never go back... despite how delicious the food was.",

Okay, regular 15-20% for you!  Okay, so let me put that aside and say, cook the food yourself. The BBQ combos are great. I love the green onion salad it is so addictive and so amazing and I could probably eat pounds of it. It's lame that they charge more for basically everything but it's a nice place to go, and I believe they use a few pieces of charcoal in with the gas grill adding extra flavor.   The restaurant itself is very small, but if you're a nerd check out the gaming store on the same block. They've got magic, board games and warhammer.",

    "text": "A fellow yelper told me I should check this place out.  He noted that from what he remembered it was okay, but that I should give it a go if I haven't been just to compare it to the rest of the Korean places I tried.  So, I took his recommendation and stopped in for a quick lunch with my husband.    They have a good selection of Korean food, from various jigae's (hot pot) to nengmyun (cold noodle soup), as well as Korean-Chinese favorites like Jangpong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and jajangmyun (noodles with black bean past sauce).  They also have a pretty good offering for lunch specials, various bento boxes and combination plates.    I got a nengmyun and galbi (marinated short rib) combo lunch and my husband ordered a bulgogi (marinated thinly sliced beef) and soon tuboo (tofu hot pot) bento.  Both our meals came with a side of california rolls, and banchan (side dishes) placed in a traditional bento tray.  The nengmyun, galbi, bulgogi, soon tuboo, and california rolls were good.  I would rank them fourth in terms of flavor and quality, after Chodang, Paldo Cafe, and Hadori/Takamatsu (tie).  However, I could not bring myself to give them any more than three stars.  Why you ask?  The mark of a good Korean restaurant is the banchan that they offer and, unfortunately, I can't say I liked any of Chuhgjib's banchans.  My criteria for an offering of good banchan is: 1) freshness, 2) flavor and 3) variety, and Chuhgajib missed the mark on all three counts.  We were offered a variety of seasoned veggies (cabbage, bean sprouts, and radish) as well as two kinds of kimchi (cabbage and cucumber).  The seasoned veggies were pretty one dimensional.  The predominant flavor for the bean sprouts and cabbage was salty and sweet for the radish; no garlic, no onion, not spicy, no sesame oil, no vinegar, etc. Both kimchis were okay, but again something was missing.  Also, the cucumber kimchi was too \"ripe\" for my taste.    Note that many Koreans prefer their kimchi to be \"ripe\" or \"aged\" in the pickling process, so this could just be a matter of personal preference.  I like my kimchis to be fresh, newly made, no older than two weeks.  I only eat \"ripe\" kimchi when it is turned into kimchi jigae, which is the way it should be made.  (Never, never use fresh kimchi for kimch jigae.)    The impression I was left with was that banchan was an afterthought, and that was a disappointment.    So, all-in-all, I would have to give them three stars.  It's their banchan that's holding them back.",

The menu offers a wide variety of selections.  They serve at least 2 Korean beers (OB & Cass) and they're both worth trying out and each goes well with the food.  Just be aware of the booths in the center aisle.  The faux word/stone benches have these holes in them by design and it feels awkward if you end up sitting on one.

I did not try any of the Korean BBQ dishes, and will not be returning to try them in the future.  Good: - The nigiri salad was good-ish...the grab bag selection of raw fish diced was generally good and most were tasty and chilled.  Bad -The nigiri salad had an awful, sugary dressing already mixed in that wasn't listed on the menu -We ordered the nigiri combo with the spicy tuna roll, yellowtail nigiri, and eel nigiri. None of the fish was any cooler than room temperature, as if they just store raw fish in the back on a counter; it did not taste fresh (which is odd considering the fish in the salad DID...). The waitress also did not bring out the spicy tuna roll until we were nearly finished and then asked if we still wanted it. -Service was not good. We saw our waitress once to order, again to bring out the sushi, and then she ignored us. I tried to get her attention to get the rest of our order and more water, but she didn't stop by again for some time and never once asked how the food was. There appeared to be three waitresses working, and the place was deserted except for one table of two and one table of two women and a child running around barefoot. Someone who may or may not have worked there was dressed in gym shorts and a t-shirt and kept wandering around an in/out of the kitchen. No idea if he worked there, so we didn't ask him. Getting our check was painful, and we didn't wait for her to return and just gave the first employee who walked by our card. Didn't see her again and we left after paying some random employee.  Not worth it, even with the Groupon deal. I don't like wondering if I'm going to get food poisoning after leaving a restaurant and the service was terrible.",

I ordered two California rolls and two Spicy tuna rolls. At the same time I ordered a beer for my dad, a Combo to grill myself and a noodle dish. By the time our group of 6 finished the sushi, the rest of the food and beer had not come. We waited and waited. We tried to flag down one of the 3 waitresses but they never looked at us. It's the 4th of July and it wasn't that busy. Turns out they didn't put our order in. The waitress apologized and told us she'll be giving us a 15% discount and offered a free appetizer. We ordered the Gyoza. After another 15 minutes they brought us the Combo so we can start grilling. The gas had been turned on since we placed the order 30mins ago and by the time we started cooking the gas ran out. Again, we tried to flag down a waitress and it took another 5 minutes to get their attention and get more gas for the burner. The stir fry noodle came out while they were changing the gas and so did the Gyoza. The Gyoza was fried and was too hard to really enjoy. We finally finished our meal but the beer never showed up. Blah. When the bill came we saw the 15% discount but was also informed that because we were a party of 6, an automatic 15% gratuity was placed on our bill. It was a wash. The meat was marinated well. The sushi was good. However, the lack of service will keep me from coming back. I guess I need to find another place.",

The food is delicious and the serving sizes are decent - not huge, not small, but just right. The decor is very entertaining, with tables literally made from trees. The menu includes food made to order or you can also grill. Either way I love it. The service is good and the people are always pleasant. The two best parts about this place, however, are the fact that they frequently have groupons, and they have a tv in the corner which is always playing Korean tv.   I would recommend this place to anyone!",

The service was excellent, the food was authentic and abundant, the price was good, there wasn't anything even remotely substandard about the place.   We didn't have a waitress...we had four.  They were smart, friendly, accomodating, and fast.  They have about 100 different pieces of sushi on the menu, but I was after Kimbap, like I used to get from the truck in Korea.  Not on the menu, but they made a couple anyway.  They carry Cass beer, the only Korean beer that travels well.  1 liter bottles of it.  As a lover of the spiced vegetable side dishes, I was thrilled to find the girls would bring new treats out as fast as we could eat them.  No extra charge, no sour faces, like at the \"other\" BBQ.  The girls brought out so much meat, we couldn't eat it all.  But they happily cooked it up and put iti n a to go box. When they brought the meat back to the table, she said there was a little extra kimchi and rice for us.  About a quart extra!!!   I've never wanted to hug the staff after a meal before yeaterday.  If you don't go eat here you're screwing yourself over.",

But then we found ohya at 12am! They even had my personal fave yogurt soju!!!! I would have given 5 starts but the prices a little high and they need to get better ventilation in the place because it gets pretty smokey in there with all the grills going. The server was great very attentive and nice. Will definitely be back for one of our late need k bbq cravings",

    "text": "My first trip to Ohya was my first visit to a Korean barbeque at all. Being a bit timid about unknown dishes, I opted for the bulgogi- MY GOD, it changed my life. I couldn't even describe the flavors in my mouth... slightly sweet, savory, faintly bbq, juicy, and oniony. That's not a word, but I digress. I raved endlessly about the bulgogi to my date, and even entertained the thought of returning the following day to order bulgogi to-go. I didn't, but vowed to be back within a week to stuff my face yet again. On my next visit with my girlfriend, we opted to try the spicy bulgogi... and damn it if they didn't serve me an even better dish! I like spice, like, a lot. The same sweet bbq flavor but with a little scorch. Today, the boyfriend and I both had the day off work, so of course I wheedled him into taking me for sushi in the afternoon. The place was nearly empty, except for a couple dudes grilling it up at their table and another solo dude. Anyway, Ohya has happy hour roll prices ALL DAY EVERY DAY and daily beer specials. Everything is super affordable, and the dark wood interior and low lighting really transports me.... to a place I've never been, but I trust this is what a hip joint somewhere in Korea would feel like. Did I mention they have two private karaoke rooms? Don't get me started on my love for karaoke. I got sidetracked, and didn't even talk up the sushi. The Crunchy Cali Roll was cool and refreshing, and the Shrimp Tempura Roll had a great crunch and fresh flavor. I, however, fell in love with the Crispy Tuna Roll. It's basically a Cali Roll tempura'd topped with spicy tuna, a spicy aioli, and I think Sriracha.  Suffice it to say, I'm in love with Ohya!",

    "text": "Seriously I literally just left there its valentines day, and my son is sick so I went there for a togo order of sushi (literally 3 rolls) now I want you to ask about how long should that take for a togo order? 15-20 minutes for a restaurant that isn't really all that busy. I ordered my food (btw the waitress was incredibly nice and the ONLY saving grace at this HOLE of a restaurant.)   And after 20 mintues of waiting I asked the waitress if I could get an ETA, as i was now getting pressed for time. I watched her walk over to the \"sushi chef\" and ask him and then I was FLOORED to see how he reacted, I don't want to cuss on this site for the sake of the readers but to see a grown man start yelling at this poor girl in the restaurant in front of customers was unacceptable. So the server came back and told me that it would take another 30 minutes for my food&^$#%^*&^ are you kidding me. So I told her to cancel the order and refund my money to my card I am not waiting 60 minutes for a couple pieces of sushi...especially after seeing people who came in after me get their meals and their sushi.  This so called sushi chef is clearing and incompetent &^$$wad who has to compensate for his inadequacies by berating a  woman. I have a couple choice words for this place...1 you will never get any business from me again (even though the korean isn't that bad) 2. GTFO of the restaurant business if you are going to treat people this was especially your server.  I have eaten here before and their sushi is mediocre at best but it was the closest sushi place to my house and seeing how I was basically just getting california rolls how bad could they screw up.  Yeah I am man and right now I am giving my opinion on what I saw it was ridiculous.  please for the love of people patron somewhere else",

Service was friendly enough, but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted. We settled on the kalbi, bulgogi and the ribeye? steak meats, with an order of the tofu soup. Everything was a-okay but I think the only thing that stood out was the ribeye. Normally we like to cook the meat ourselves but since we didnt want to stink on our plane ride back to cali, we decided to let them do it for us. Side dishes were standard with the different pickled veggies, kimchi, potato salad, etc. Waiters were pretty prompt in bringing out replacement side dishes for us.     Since we don't know the area very well, the stars are good service, being open at odd hours (I think we got there at 4pm?) clean restaurant, decent food. -2 stars for small portions and no real wow factor.",

They also have cheap alcohol and fair enough sushi, although I wouldn't go there specifically for the sushi. The service is hit or miss, depending on the time of day. It seems that the turn over rate is high since I've been there at least 8 - 10 times and haven't seen the same wait staff twice.   They also play KPop and have private Karaoke rooms that you can rent.   Overall, this is my go to place for Korean food.",

All other Korean restaurant overcharged you but these guys are very reasonable at 20 bucks. I wish they would do this for all days instead of just mon to wed. The only other thing is a good vinegary type sauce. You can also do a half order if you are afraid of wasting food. Waitress super nice. Overall great experience.",

Looks sketch out front (the printer home made signs don't help), but once you walk inside you quickly realize a place like this is more suitable for Scottsdale with a trendy urban feel. Ordered the Black Bean Noodles and some awesome cold sake at the suggestion of my waitress Kelly, and wow. This dish alone will bring me back, but the great sake selection and prices don't hurt at all.   It won't be for everyone, and isl ikely more popular with younger crowds with broader tastes. I assume it helps being a cross the street from ASU. Although I woudnt bring mom for dinner, I'd sure as heck come here for a fun energetic environment where K-Pop and Asian rap is always playing.  I didn't have any sushi, but honestly wouldn't come here for that anyways since the Korean food seems legit.   Keep it up, and thanks Kelly.",

So finally someone comes to ask if we would like water and told us there are no ayce kbbq on the weekend....you would think that it would have been listed on their board at the front or on their menu....because quite frankly I think that's where announcements are made about their specials in regards to food and/or drinks....? Terrible service and unprofessional. Mind you, we stopped by their other location since their hours stated they were opened. Well no signs of explanation, just that the doors were locked and lights were off. So here, we just got up and left since we came for ayce and it was not being served. We will never come back because we've been to enough restaurants to know what we would be willing to pay for.",

I could immediately  see: Dirty tables- understaffed with just 1 server who's really SWEET but probably  a better Hostess.  I sat for almost 7min. Before she brought me water w/lemon.. she didn't ask me just brought it that way  Next something in the kitchen was burning. Since the place is \"cozy\" the smell was everywhere.  The Gyoza for start.. FAIL I can't confirm but it tastes average like the frozen kind you pan fry w/water.   Sushi...took over HALF AN HOUR I was literally putting on my Sunglasses to LEAVE when she came out with it. Not to mention the Whole area is now clouded with Smoke and my eyes were waterig!!  So here it is...the TASTE. .can ALL be Forgiven? ??? Nope. The \"spicy peach sauce\" is NOT spicy and slightly watery. (??) The Volcano roll which was supposed to come out on Fire..water as fully extinguished...which is a match to my soul when the salmon skin was rubbery and under seasoned.    Service... a guy came in and Hugged my server and after her laughing off how she had so many dirty tables ..started bussing!?!?!. Idk if he was a potential BF candidate or a True friend because  his shirt said Los Compadres not OHYA.  Lol  I'm guessing  potential  Boyfriend because there was a double high five and kiss/peck at the end there.   All in all... decent to low on taste and fail on service. The decor was creative and I give them props for effort. I hope the future  Scottsdale location is managed better.",

Up in the bar with my homies, trying get some Korean Seafood Tofu soupy cause you know how it is I saw some kimchi was tasting how spicy? from the smell it was kicking in my nose  you would think that it kill me so I decided to chill Tofu soup is spicy, it got my head feeling like it was ready to blow! I'm saying \"It's spicy! It's spicy!\"  So I had to get some water to cleanse the palate, and said \"man, that felt good\" That's when I yelped and reviewed Ohya, Ohya!  Ohya was originally CJB, another Korean BBQ Joint. Name changed so I gather the owners changed too. At a Korean BBQ joint what else do we order; of course Korean BBQ and some Tofu soup! We ordered the Galbi and it was nicely roasted with some onions. Just the right amount of char and seasoning. Yum!  However, my favorite Korean cuisine is the Seafood Tofu Soup. I can't say it's my favorite here, but it's alright. I need it to be spicy, but not overdone; and super hot in temperature. I need it to scorch my tongue! The smell itself needs to be pungent and the egg visible. Needless to say, it didn't pass my test, but gets an okay. Moreover, the side dishes weren't that great here. Kimchi here is pretty good, but that's about it. Didn't care for the steamed napa cabbage or bean sprouts. Service is on top of things. They do a great job and are very attentive. Overall, the experience of the place is decent and nothing too spectacular. If you need a quick Korean bite and taste then you gotta do what you gotta do! - Enjoy!",

The other menu items are okay if you're really jonesing for some Korean food or quick sushi.   Things I've had here: Bimbim bap: sometimes they run out of the clay pots and then it's not nearly as good. This portion is a little smaller than I'd like and the meat is a little lower quality  Soon dobu: spicy Korean tofu soup. It's hard to get this wrong and they don't. But I've definitely had better.  Korean fried chicken: very very generous with their portions here. It's way too much sweet sauce for my taste though. I would honestly skip this.  Sushi: it's actually not bad to be honest. The cut of fish are average but they don't drown you with rice and their pieces are pretty good sized.  Their menus and tables are usually some sort of sticky which isn't great and the BBQ pits are electric which make cooking a real hassle. I would say you could do better but if you're in the neighborhood and don't want to commit to a drive then you can certainly come here.",

There was some confusion when the salad came out since it was NOT what we got the last 3 times we were there. The cabbage salad we had last time was large, with fresh, crisp cabbage and a light dressing. The one that got brought out to us looked like somebody's leftovers. It was 1/4 of the size we got last time, and it wasn't crispy and airy, it was damp and drenched in dressing. After saying something to the waitress she said \"oh yeah, it does look a lot smaller than usual! Oh well!\" and went along her way...Very disappointing. The meats were good per usual.

Even if the pork belly is actually shade too fatty, and the chicken a wee bit gristly the marinated beef and pork ribs more than make up for any deficiencies. The banchan are on point, from pickled bean sprouts to marinated chunks of potato to deliciously garlicy kimchi. The sesame oil with pepper is a condiment that can pretty much up the game of any meal, but here works best sprinkled on the white rice served with the barbecue right before you top the rice with the meat.   If, as I was on my most recent visit, you crave a little more starch, the bibimbap served in a hot stone bowl is the ticket. The trick is not stirring the toppings into the bottom of the bowl too vigorously. Instead, let that bottom layer continue to cook against the bowl while you eat from the top, and you will be rewarded at the end with a deliciously crunchy rice crust that's better than any dessert. Oh, and there's soju, sake, and beer on offer.   I could eat at this place multiple nights in a row and not get bored. Word to the wise, you will leave smelling like bbq.",

    "text": "Much of what I stated in my first review is still True.  I do enjoy the food here at OHYA.  The karaoke rooms are fun and affordable, too.  This update follows some sorely understated service in our most recent visit here.  We attended a friend's graduation festivities in the large karaoke room.  We all ordered sushi and various dishes.  It was somewhere between 50-60 minutes from the time that we placed the order for sushi that it actually arrived.  The entrees arrived earlier, maybe 30-40 minutes after ordering.  It was a very slow process, which was frustrating.  Beyond this, the wait staff would step into the room, which was loud with karaoke music, and state the name of the sushi roll or dish.  We were seated on the far end of the room.  We'd ask \"What?\" when we couldn't understand what had been said and, in most instances, they'd not notice our waves until someone in our party pointed us out.  In one instance they just set a sushi roll down and no one knew what it was, not even the folks sitting next to the door.  Our water was also never refilled -- fortunately there were extra water cups on our table.  To exacerbate our existing frustration, we asked for our check around 7:55 PM.  Around 8:20 PM we still had no sign of a check, and no staff had returned to our room in that almost half hour window.  We ended up having to hunt down our server to pay, as did another couple in our party.  We had planned to stay about 1.5 hours.  We ended up being there closer to 2.25 hours, with a large chunk of that being time spent waiting for service.  This was a Tuesday night.  There were several full tables, but by no means a full house.  If I give them the benefit of the doubt, it seems they may have been understaffed.  Still....not pleased, OHYA.  And I had loved you, so much.",

Although the wait for food the last 2 times has been longer than average, 15 minutes for a dynamite roll for example, i still i put up with it because it's the only Korean bbq within a 30 mile radius of where i live.    Unfortunately, today was the last straw. I went in for lunch, ordered 2 salmon nigiri, I even checked it on her sheet which she said was not necessary because she has great memory, although when it came out it was a salmon roll. I also ordered a bulgogi bento box as well as a dynamite roll. When the bulgogi bento box came out I took one bite of the meat and it was cold. Whatever happened to fresh food?  Sorry,  you lost a customer today.",

For $7.95 I would expect they peel them. Did not try that \"cook your own meat\" as I am not into that. Probably a good place if you're trying to impress someone for the first time and want to hang around for a while. Not for me. Won't repeat.",

    "text": "This review is just for the food, I haven't tried out the karaoke rooms yet.  Definitely one of the best Korean restaurants in the Valley, from the handful we get to choose from. I like that there is a grill at the table, but I was disappointed to learn that they do not have all you can eat. Back home in California, AYCE can go for $18-25, but here, you can get combos that are around $35-40 for three people. Still, the food is good.   Another thing I wish they had is a larger variety of banchan. Their fish cakes are good, and so is the kimchi. Their Rainbow rolls are pretty good, as well as their sashimi. The servers try to be attentive, but for the night I went, they seemed a wee bit understaffed. Plus, they also play some K-pop! Overall, I think this place is the best Korean restaurant in North Phoenix, and I will definitely be coming back here again.",

Sitting in the bar area, we already know we need to immediately ask someone for service, otherwise they will ignore us and come and go without giving a second glance. It's too bad they do not treat their regular customers better. If you are sitting on the restaurant side, it's a little better in terms of service. We've done both sides but mostly we go to the bar for the happy hour specials, which are quite good. I wish I could give more than 2 star but I can't just help remembering all the times we were either ignored or waited at the bar for a ridiculous amount of time. Our last 2 visits, we ended up walking out and heading to another sushi joint not too far away which also has all day happy hour, $5 sake bombers and fortunately for us, really great customer service.

With a hankering for Korean food and all it's spicy, sweet, and savory goodness I came here to OHYA. To be honest, after dining here it wasn't so much of an OH YA! for me more like OH, OH ... that's it?  Ordered the Dolsot Bulgogi Bibimbap and the Seafood Soft Tofu Soup. The Bibimbap was alright, props to the clay bowl and sauce being pretty decent. Good amount of veggies, but meat seemed a bit lackluster. You can bet I doused my bowl in the Gochujang sauce. The Tofu Soup was just okay, lacking in seafood, they put imitation crab meat sticks in it which is a big no-no for me. You either put mussels, clams, shrimp in it not imitation seafood.  You get a discount for checking in, so be sure to tell your server prior to your bill coming out. The service was good, being that there were only 3 other tables occupied in the huge place with 3 other servers, but only one was serving/helping out. It was interesting. Our waitress was good though, as she kept checking up on us and such.",

    "text": "I used to be a regular here at Ohya for this place is located very close to my school (ASU west). I came here on many occasions with friends and have introduced many people to this spot. I normally get okay service however my last visit was very unexpectedly inappropriate. My waiter found me on social media after my visit just to comment about his tip.  Let me start from the beginning, my friend brought me here on my birthday, a Saturday around 3pm. Before arrival we called and ordered a few sushi rolls ahead of time over the phone because we were in a hurry and they usually take a long time to make your rolls from my previous visits. Since the food was ready by the time we got there, we were in and out within 20 minutes. I wasn't sure if the waitress dining the table next to us was our waitress because no one checked up on us, but by the time we were done eating and ready for the bill our waiter finally came to refill our drinks. (it was surprisingly not busy there for a Saturday however, it was 3pm). My friend tipped according to how much service he gave which was 10% of the bill.   The day after on a Sunday night, I received a comment on a photo I posted of their food on instagram a month ago (with the same rolls I ordered from my last visit). It was from the waiter making a comment about how low I tipped him. I was extremely shocked and have no idea how he found me. I thought it was inappropriate and uncomfortable for him to find me on social media and have to say something just because of a tip. Either way tipping is optional and I usually tip 20%, however my friend tipped according to how much service he gave us. I replied back to him asking what his name was and he deleted his comment. See the photos I posted of screen shots of the incident and his IG profile to avoid him if you visit. I now feel very uncomfortable returning to this restaurant over the situation that occurred and will not be bringing my friends here if this is the kind of service I get back.  EDIT: I reached out to the owner with the same story and after further investigation he let go of the waiter. You are now safe to come eat here without being stalked!",

Our waiter was quick and attentive (we were here earlier in the evening and the restaurant wasn't very busy). We went through 7 rounds and tried the bulgoli, LA galbi, jumuluck, ribeye, tongue, and chadol baegi. The meets were all of good quality except for our last round of bulgolgi. That round consisted of mostly fat. Everything had good flavor and I enjoyed all of it except the tongue. I have a weird avoidance of certain textures and the tongue was too chewy for me. The sides were the standard sides of kimchee, bean sprouts, macaroni salad, potato salad, etc. The only request I would have is to offer a half onion to season the grill (the waiter said it would be an extra charge) and provide shears to cut/trim the meat as some pieces were rather large.",

I decided to have the 3\" cut beef and chicken. Most of the steak was frozen but the chicken wasn't, so that's a plus lol. Side dishes paired well with rice, lettuce wrap and your choice of meat.   Was it a great experience? Yes. Will I be returning? No. Not because it's a bad place at all, I just think the way to go with this style of a dining experience is a higher end place with fresh ingredients.   Blonde server was awesome though!",

I enjoyed my stay within the private area (even if the microphones didn't work for most of the time), but was also, discouraged by the lack of service as it was not performed in a timely manner since there was only one waitress. She also, did not give back the correct change (after the tip was given) when paid with cash and was a bit abrupt in manner. In addition, the Ramen tasted delicious besides the abundance of fat attached to the bits of meat within the murky soup. The prices were also, a bit overpriced for a few of the small pieces/dishes. Overall, I would go again to try something different, but would not try to the Ramen again as it was definitely not the greatest I've had. I would also, pay with card to avoid getting a few dollars taken away. Lol.",

We got one of the combos and it was around $35 for 2 people. Comparable to what you can find in California except for 1 thing. It's not all you can eat. It's just one plate of meat.  Having experienced what awesome AYCE Korean BBQ is ranging from $9.99 to $19.99, I say this place is no good given the amount of meat and the lack of service.  Given that AZ has nothing besides 3 to 4 Korean BBQ places in the entire valley area that spans an hour drive from one end to the other, this is ok. But probably not worth your money.  I didn't try their sushi or their karaoke service but I'm sure one day, I will.",

The staff have definitely changed since then and saying that the service was bad was understatement.   I came today during lunch hour with my sister and had to wait to be seated for about 10 minutes. It was understandable as they were super busy, but I think expecting a welcoming greeting isn't too much to ask for. We only stood there awkwardly and waited to be acknowledged.   After we got seated, we waited another 15 mins until our server came to ask us what we wanted to drink but then she warned us that it would take 45 mins as the kitchen is slammed with orders.   If they were that slammed, why didn't we just warned before we got seated? I could have saved 20 mins and taken my business elsewhere. Needless to say, we had lunch somewhere else.   The server was still very nice but I won't be coming back here again as this was not the first time this has happened.",

We started off with a female server who is petite and of Asian decent, she was not so good, almost rude. Before I could even order a role she said \"I wouldn't order sushi, we have about 9 rolls in front of you...\". Well maybe this shouldn't be named a sushi bar, she later ignored us for a few minutes. we still ordered it and did receive it about 30 minutes later. I believe she got a bad vibe off of us and decided to switch is up with Jade who was a great server! She deserves to run this place!",

    "text": "First time here for husband and I. Wasn't sure what to expect with all the mixed reviews, but had a LivingSocial deal & no desire to cook on Thursday night, so in we went. The lady that greeted us at the door (and took our order) was very pleasant and polite but very difficult to understand with her heavy Asian accent. Decor is not bad, everything is black. Hopefully not to cover up dirt (which was plainly visible in the bathroom.) Table itself seemed pretty clean though. Oddly, hip-hop music was playing the whole time we were there. There were a few Korean (I assume) families dining in the restaurant during our meal (that may or may not mean anything).  The menu is fairly extensive, with many choices of sushi, Korean food, Japanese entrees, and Korean BBQ (which is done at the table if you order that). Every day they had a drink special and Thursday was Four Peaks drafts for $2, which worked for us! We ordered Bibim Bap with Spicy Seafood served in hot stone bowl and Spicy pan fried Squid with Vegetables (Ojing Ah Bokum) to share, and requested a Mango Pop Roll (\"Tempura white fish, cream cheese, fresh sweet mango, avocado rolled in soy paper, drizzled with spicy mango sauce with crunch\") to eat first as an appetizer.  Shortly, the Bibim Bap came out in a very hot stone bowl. A few minutes after that, the Korean side dishes & rice came out. Then a little later, the sushi (which looked incredible). We each had time to eat one delicious, sweet, sushi piece then the squid came out. Oh boy, did my eyes light up when I saw the squid dish - it was so hot, heavy steam was coming off it and it was sizzling like fajitas. I admit I actually said \"OH YA!\" when I saw the feast in front of us. The entrees were just the right amount of spice (we weren't asked how hot we wanted it to be, but we both enjoy very spicy food) and the flavor was perfect - especially in the squid dish. We decided to eat the sushi for dessert instead. It was so good, we ate everything in front of us. It was more than enough food though - next time we won't be getting an \"appetizer\" - we were stuffed! Everything was cleared away quickly when we finished, and our check came promptly.   I give it overall four stars -  5 for the food (It couldn't have been better) 3.5 for the service (attentive and polite but difficulties with communication) 2.5 for the ambiance (because the bathroom was so dirty and the music sucked) 4 for the value (seemed to be priced reasonably)  I will be back...",

The veggie/apps that are a traditional Korean staple were fair except the green beans tasted like they had been prepared in a dirty old sock.  The chigae tasted like they added 20 tablespoons of salt!  The rice was overcooked.  My boyfriend and I could barely eat but I unfortunately ate more than he did.  We ate less than 1/4 of our meal as we both could not stomach another bite.   Our server brought back two 1's and the rest were $5's (hint hint??). Our bill was $18 and I think she was expecting at least a $5 tip.   We paid our bill and did not tip her $5.  30 minutes later I'm in the bathroom and was in the bathroom for the rest of the day as my body obviously didn't agree with the food.  We both agreed that we should've turned around as soon as we walked in.  Ugh!",

    "text": "We were in the area shopping and found this place through Yelp.   The outside of the entrance was a little strange as there were two different sets of signs with two different names on the side of the building and then there was a banner that said \"OHYA\".  When we walked in, we thought the place had a nice setup and then you look left and you see paint supplies and other construction type items in an unfinished area.   We were immediately seated but it took something like 20 minutes for our order to be taken. There was one waitress for 6-8 filled tables so it was obvious why the service was taking so long. The waitress wasn't brimming with friendliness but she was certainly cordial enough.   We ordered some sushi rolls, shumai, a hot tofu soup and the teriyaki chicken. The side dishes were decent but not the best I've ever had. The kimchi though was pretty outstanding and yummy crunchy and fresh. I had to ask for a side of rice which was beyond strange as most Korean places automatically give you a side with your main. The eel on our rolls was pretty fatty (still yummy) as was the chicken teriyaki and the shumai was obviously frozen as it tasted mildly freezer burnt and the shrimp in my husband's tofu soup were still on the raw side.   During our 2 HOUR dinner (told ya, the service is slooooow) we had plenty of time to think about if we would come back and I'm not sure that we will. The food quality wasn't horrible (Kimchi rocked!) but the service was so slow and you almost felt bad about asking the waitress for anything due to how swamped she was.   It was a bit of an awkward environment and with 4-6 other Korean restaurants in a 4 mile radius, this place is not at the top of our list.",

We got the Salmon Lunch Box. Pretty good. Alright size for a 6 dollar lunch salmon. The sides were small and the kind of sides you get with Korean BBQ (Never know what they are, I'll eat them but they are not my favorite and very small.) egg roll was a little squishy... But as far as the salmon goes, it was good and flavorful. Good white rice. Ramen was pretty good. Nice and big, plenty of meat and noodles. Broth was flavorful but not the best I've ever had. You can tell they are really trying with the decor. They've almost got it... The service was really great! Very sweet girls! I just don't think I'll be making any special trip back.

Cheap, gives you the option of grilling, great prices, and great choices. Most Korean places in AZ no longer serve ddukbokki (spelling may vary) anymore, but this place does!  While I'm not a big fan of the lunch menu, it is a very good value if you're okay with the selection. I think the food is generally on point, and I'm a fan of their selection of side dishes (especially the fish cake and cucumber!). Definitely go for a tofu soup + meat combo for the most bang for your buck. The seafood pancake here is also absolutely delicious and huge for what you pay--especially compared to other Korean restaurants.  That being said, the restaurant does lose a star for fluctuations in food and service quality. Last time I was here with my parents, they messed up our order and wanted to give us a different meat dish than the one we ordered. We insisted on sticking with old order and just waiting. On the plus side, they got the correct dish out to us not long after we talked, but on the negative side, I don't think they would have caught it if I hadn't asked the waitress, and my family was certainly not impressed.",

I have had really good attentive services throughout the meal, and other times, had no service at all (in the end, I could've walked out unpaid and no one will ever notice).  The food is good, their sashimi salad is decent, the Korean BBQ is tasty with the accessories that come with the order.",

Our Jajameuyng was had a very smoky aroma, and the moment I took a bite, I could taste the burnt charcoal flakes. I took a closer inspection and found the black burnt flakes floating around the noodle. If a restaurant accidentally burns their food, they should throw it away and make a new one for their customer. Saving a few dimes and skimping on quality of food will cost you a customer. First and last time that I will come here.",

    "text": "Ever since I moved to Arizona in August, I have been a loyal customer. I used to dine in/take out at least one a week. This was before their recent expansion, which includes a sushi bar and karaoke rooms.   The amount of food used to match the price. The ingredients and flavors were fairly representative of authentic Korean food. When I ordered take out, they would pack the boxes to the brim. I'd have to be careful opening the container because it was just that full. Not only was the soup abundant, but the meat to tofu ratio meant more meat than tofu. They would also pack the side dish containers to the brim.  But since their renovation, I've noticed a decrease in their customer service. It takes a while for them to jot down your order when you dine in, which is understandable when they're busy. (But this is a red flag that they need to begin redoing their training so that the waiters and chefs know how to handle a larger crowd.)   When I order take out, they only fill the containers about 1/2-3/4ths full. There are more \"filler\" ingredients now. Any order with noodles means more noodles and less meat. Orders of meat have been about 4 pieces of galbi (for example), and the rest of the container is filled with onions, whereas I used to receive 8-9 pieces. They even changed their container boxes from the long rectangular boxes that was specifically for the meat, to small square boxes that also hold rice. Rice portions have decreased to a small handful as opposed to two to three large handfuls. Soup orders are 3/4ths full, with minimal stock and chunks of tofu. More than half the container is tofu at this point. And the most noticeable change in service is their substitution of actual pork meat for bacon. Because bacon comes with its own flavor, this changes the taste of the soup and noodle dishes, which compromises the authentic Korean flavor.  I am just thoroughly disappointed at the service and the lack of care for quality [ingredients] by this restaurant as I was a customer before they made these decisions. I wouldn't be as disappointed if they didn't also increase their prices. I understand that making a profit is important, but undercutting the quality to increase the gap between cost of goods and goods sold is not the way to proceed.  Sadly, I will no longer be returning to OhYa to get my Korean fix.",

THIS PLACE DOES!! My staples are the Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crab and most of all the Volcano Roll (I dream about this roll). They do happy hour pricing and all-you-can-eat 1-2 times a month. I don't know if i have a stomach big enough to benefit from the all you can eat, so I haven't done it yet. My husband gets their Korean soup and can't wait to try their Bu Dae Chigae, apparently none of the other places we have gone to have offered that dish. Love that they bring sides and keep them traditional and absolutely love their sushi!",

I've been a regular customer since its remodel a couple years back I got to say I'm kind of tired of how often they change their menu and their prices. Even when you use a Groupon it seems very expensive.  I had an uncomfortable experience with one of their servers once. I asked for a refill on my water and she said with a serious face \"No!\" I looked at her surprised and then she say \"just kidding\"....honestly I still don't know how to interpret that situation.  They have so many servers changing all the time I never see the same ones. For example, one time a server honored our Groupon for happy hour sushi. Next time a different server said they could not honor Groupon on happy hour sushi. And the third time we went we saw the sushi menu say \"No discounts or coupons with happy hour sushi\" So which one is which? First they say yes then it's a no.  I wish they had a Groupon for their korean food and not only for sushi.",

    "text": "Whenever I read Yelp reviews for non-American cuisine, I want to know a little something about the reviewer in order to gauge how much weight to give the review.  So first, about me...I am a 1.5 generation Korean-American dad married to a 1st generation Korean woman who travels with two little girls (3 and 6 y/o) who always need at least one Korean meal a day.  TRANSLATION: I think I know a little something about authentic and/or tasty Korean food.  We happened to be traveling to the north end of PHX once last month and thought we would try this restaurant for dinner.  BIG MISTAKE.  Our biggest complaint is that the meals were too salty.  We had orders of ribs, bibim bap, and mushroom soon tofu.  Everything was TOO SALTY.  We got the soon tofu soup for the girls in the white (non-spicy) form.  A non-spicy format inherently makes it less salty, but my wife had to dilute it 1:1 (yes, equal volumes) with water to make it palatable.  We thought it might have been a fluke, but both the bibimbap and ribs were also too salty.  Our next complaint was that the service was very spotty.  Like in the Verizon commercial, we were wondering if any of the staff were there or could hear us.  This became an issue and was noticeable as we frequently needed more water and white rice (to eat the salty meal).    THE GOOD.  We wondered why this place has received such high marks on Yelp.  We came up with 3 possibilities.  FIrst, price.  Their menu consists of many combo items (ie. ribs/soon tofu) which come with smaller portions and lower prices.  Second and third, lack of Korean restaurants in the area in association with patrons that want to experience some form of Korean food and don't know that they could do much better.",

Im not complaining becuase I like my food hot and this place delivers. Could have used a little more rice but had I asked Im sure they would have brought some more. Will def come back again.",

They have delicious Korean BBQ and they offer combination meals that include about 6-8 sizzling plates that is shareable for a big group. Service was quick and always accommodated us. But slowly things went downhill; they started cutting down on portion sizes and charging for extra things, like substitutions and RICE! Recently they have expanded to next door and added a sushi bar and karaoke rooms. I have yet to try either of those, but my suggestion would be to soundproof those karaoke rooms! Diners in the restaurant can hear it all, good or bad :X Guess I'll need to start looking for a new KBBQ place around Phoenix to get my fix!",
