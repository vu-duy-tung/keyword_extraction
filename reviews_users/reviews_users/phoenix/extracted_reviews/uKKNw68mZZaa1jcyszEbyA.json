    "text": "A hangover's best friend can be found inside these four trendy walls. The first thing that brought me here was the fact that they carried Heart Roasters beans from Portland. Once they whipped out some coffee I knew I was in the perfect location for the area. While sipping on some delicious coffee they brought around free dessert samples (FREE!) to everyone. How they possibly stay in business giving away free dessert is none of my business but I will ride that gravy train until the closed sign shows up out front.   The terrible crowd when I was there does stop me from dolling out a 5 star rating... which I get is a GOOD thing that people want to be here but they just don't seem to have any intention of learning how to handle a mass crowd. When you are popular, you need to figure out ways to turn tables better, faster, make room, be faster on your service feet. They also seem to him and cry too much about substitutions which always makes me roll my eyes as I walk away. I wish with my 2.5 years in the service industry I could of told people they couldn't of done that! A dream of mine at night I tell you. With all that said, the place has some room for improvement on the management/business run side but the dessert I sampled and some I stole from my friend were dynamite.   Most of the food I understand is local grown and the presentation is top notch. Their is for sure a reason this place has been very busy every time I step inside the door. Give it a visit but plan plan plan to be there longer than you think. This most likely won't be a hop on, eat, out the door unless you are visiting at some odd hours or are the big asshole sliding in five minutes before close.",

Not only is the food outstanding but the staff is so incredibly attentive, warm and welcoming. The restaurant is tiny and they also have an espresso bar with delicious coffee. I had the crepe burrito which was to die for and my friend had the chicken pesto crepe.   For dessert, we share the \"first time\" which is a crepe filled with sliced bananas and Nutella...I don't need to say any more.",

It's really, really good.  The place was pretty busy for a Friday morning, but I had no trouble finding a table.  The staff were super helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable and not over the top trendy.  I ordered the breakfast burro crepe and it was even better than I thought it would be.  While waiting for my meal they brought out sample size portions of fresh granola, salad, thick toast with nutella and fresh strawberry jam (which was incredibly good), and a cookie slice at the end.  I only spent $7 and felt like I was eating at a place much fancier and more expensive.  I will definitely go back and have already been telling friends.",

When you walk in, you will notice how tidy, clean and quaint everything is. Not ideal for huge parties though, but not sure who would bring a huge party to get crepes. Once you get up to the front and figure out what you want to purchase (which is a feat on its own considering their selection), you will be greeted by wonderful service. I have been here half a dozen times, about half to get take out, and the other half for to stay, and every time service has really been top notch.  While I was waiting for my food, I got a little sample of their granola. After our dine in, we got a little cookie as a thank you dessert. It is small touches like this which really bring customers back.  Outside their sweet (my favorite) and savory crepes, I really enjoyed their selection of beverages. I've had their chai, and their coffee, and both were wonderful.   The only thing I advise is that you come here with a few friends. This way, you can try more than one crepe because believe me when I say you will not be satisfied with only having 1 from their wonderful selection.",

This last time I had something with pork belly and egg.  It was ridiculously good.  I think they only have it at certain times a day so that is a must.  What's funny is that the clientele is a diverse as the menu.  I've seen soccer moms, couples, and a group of dudes ride up on their motorcycles.  If you can bring in people from all walks of life like that, then you must be doing something right.",

    "text": "I just had the best brunch of all time...  I knew of Crepe bar food truck so imagine my delight when I was checking out hot new businesses on Yelp and saw they had opened a store front just a few miles from me! So I high-tailed it over there asap.  They did not disappoint! We were greeted as soon as we walked in. Everyone is friendly and enthusiastic. They asked if it was our 1st time in and explained a bit about the menu and how to order etc. We got the custard with berries and the breakfast burrito, a cappuccino and a pomogranate green iced tea.  I was delighted to see the square pay and iPad they use. It's so easy and efficient. And to me a sign of a modern efficient business.  As we were waiting for our food our server chatted with us a bit, she was great with my kids! We just loved her warm friendly personality.   Then our drinks came out. Heaven. My cappuccino was smooth and rich. I saw on the sign they use Ecco coffee...score! One of the best local coffee guys hands down. My husband got the pom green tea which also was delicious.  Our food came out next. It was beautiful. The breakfast burrito was huge. Bold flavors. Just delicious. My kids scarfed down the custard and berries so fast I was lucky I even got a bite. Those crepes were SO good that we went for another! This time we got the \"first time\" - banana and nutella. Classic and very good. I loved the brulee on top, kind of gave it a roasted marshmellow flavor and texture. Oh my stars it was so good.  While we were stuffing our faces, the owner came over and introduced himself and thanked us for coming in. I LOVE that. Then we had a nice little chat. It was great! We really felt like valued customers and I'm so appreciative of that.  No question, I will be back. A lot. This place is only 1 mile from my kids school. Awesome!",

The crepe  was well flavored with ham and much to my surprise had a  crispy texture at the edges.  The Crepe Bar will be a welcome addition to the rotation of lunch places around the work place.",

But you're luck if you do, because it's really good!  The boyfriend and I went for breakfast on a Saturday. It was busy but not packed. We ordered 2 crepes to share - the breakfast burrito and a banana brulee. The crepes came out to the table pretty fast which was good because we were starving. We started with the sweet crepe. SO good. We could have easily downed a couple of these, they were that good. They had a nice sweet syrup on them that wasn't too heavy, just right, and the sliced up banana complemented the caramely flavor well.  Then we moved on to the breakfast burrito. It was a nice change change from the typical tortilla burrito. It was stuffed with eggs, bacon, cheese and an avocado salsa. It had a little bit of a kick but nothing too crazy. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the flavors all worked well together.   Between the two crepes it was plenty of food for breakfast and it came out to around $12. Can't beat it! We'll be back for more crepes soon I'm sure.",

We definitely be making a return trip!!!  Highly recommended this establishment.",

    "text": "My fiance introduced this place to me a few weeks ago.  I don't care for crepes but the Crepe Bar has to be one of the best culinary surprises I have ever experienced.  I regularly get brunch here and I often have to keep myself going there too often.   Meal:  I typically get the breakfast savory crepe, a cappuccino, and recently, some granola to take home with me.  Taste:  I don't know if there is any place in Phoenix that perfectly combines savory, salty tastes and different culinary styles (Mexican and French) as well as the Crepe Bar.  Granted I have barely put a dent in all the available options in Phoenix, but whatever Crepe Bar does, Crepe Bar does it right. The cappuccino and granola alone are enough to visit Crepe Bar.  10 out of 10.  Value:  The Crepe Bar portions are a little on the same size.  They are the epitome of quality over quantity . . . or maybe I just think the portions are undersized because I could eat their food all day long.  Yes, this does make me sound like a totally glutinous schmuck, but really, their crepes are that damn good. 3 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  Service can be slower than anticipated, but then again this place isn't trying to dethrone McDonalds.  Their staff of what can only be described as sweet natured hipsters are extremely friendly without coming off as insincere.  9 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Simple, easy to get around.  While the lack of furniture and tables may remind you of a fresh-out-college kid's apartment, it works extremely well.  It is eclectic, slightly mismatched, and if there was anymore else in there, it would be too much.  It is kind of humorous that its in a strip mall, which I didn't expect when I first go there.  The walls are decorated with just the right amount of local artists' work.  5 out of 5.  Overall:  If you want to surprise a friend or decided to skip a day at work, Crepe Bar is the perfect place to go.  Hell, its the perfect place to go anytime of the day.  27 points out of 30, 5 out of 5 stars.",

The only reason i didnt give five stars is because the food took 30-35 minutes, and I noticed that was about the going wait for everyone.  The kitchen is very small (i know this, because you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom), so there is probably not a whole lot they can do about turnaround time.  Anyhoo, if you are patient and not on a time crunch during their busy times, its worth the wait.",

I'll just give the facts:  the ambiance isn't my style, but if you like slick, clean industrial, you'll love it. service at all four visits -- friendly, but distracted and overworked.   first visit -- with daughter and friend a few days after opening. not crowded. waited some time for our crepes. my nutella banana was good but not mindblowing. daughter's crepe was \"bruleed\" so hard as a rock. we wrote it off to opening week.  second visit -- no fault of their own, the second time I visited the power had just gone out. actually, the power went out for a mile square radius. while waiting for power to come back on, they served us their homemade granola with almond milk. pure delight.  third visit -- went for late morning breakfast with hubby. i appreciate a good cup of coffee, but it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get it, and it not be HOT. food came another 10 minutes later, so so much for coffee with our breakfast. food was awesome though -- we had a sweet and a savory crepe.   fourth visit -- went on a Friday night for their new dinner service. came with friends. BYOB. Service is friendly, but distracted. food was incredible...burrata with tomato jam and basil oil, swiss chard pierogi with brussels sprouts salad, duck confit arancini with some crazy pesto with cocoa nibs in it, the best pork belly i ever had and some insane sous vide cheesecake thing with maple apples.   we'll keep trying for a better breakfast experience, but wow, those thursday and friday night dinners? i may go back each week!",

Also the food was delicious, very delicious, and portion size was good for the price... although I had to look past the HAIR on my plate under my crepe.  I would have complained, but I had already waited far too long for my crepe to arrive, even though there were only a handful of customers in the place. So, since I was on my lunch break, I couldn't wait around for another crepe to be made.  Because I was running late, I asked for a to-go cup for my coffee, and was forced to grab my own, as the food runner didn't actually remember to bring me one.  So if we count stars..  +2 for excellent service from the girl behind the register and the taste/quality of the food.  -3 for the forgetful hipster server guy, the long wait, and the hair in my food.   Let me just say that again.. HAIR... IN .. MY ... FOOD. To the mgmt.. please give that girl a raise, and have a talk with your kitchen crew.",

Good amount of seats, able to cater to small and big parties. Order first and seat down with a letter while you wait for your food.   What did I order: Lemon Curd, Grand Prix, Cold Brew, and Honey Latte  Lemon Curd: 5/5 - Crepes were cooked perfectly and slightly sweet. Lemon curd is tangy and smooth. Hibiscus gel is interesting because I never tasted Hibiscus before but it's similar to a raspberry pomegranate, where it has a bit of tart, sweet kick and a little soury notes. It pairs very good with the lemon and crepe.   Grand Prix: 5/5  - WOW..... looking at what went into this dish I was curious how the ExpressoMaple would taste with the chili Aioli. I took a bite of everything on my fork. I must say this is one of the best things i've tasted for breakfast. There is multiple layers of flavors here - perfectly cooked pork belly with amazing flavor, soft fried egg, crepe.  After one bite.... all I have to say is AWESOMESAUCE!! give this a go. It's worth it.   Honey Latte and Cold Brew: will wake you up! good Cold Brew and Honey latte is nicely balance. Not overally sweet.",

A nice surprise we're the banana espresso scone tasting bites delivered to my table as I waited.  They were good but more like a little dense.  They had some of the tartness I expect but weren't as flaky as I like, but again, really tasty.    I got the Grand Prix crepe that is one of their special coffee crepes with an amazing espresso maple syrup, pork belly and a sunny side egg.  I tried each of the components separately, supper yum but together.....  I'm is breakfast heaven.    I am always glad to add some indulgence to the start of my day.

    "text": "After reading lots of rave reviews and seeing the number of awards this place has won, I decided to venture over to check out the Crepe Bar.  The place was small and definitely not for big groups.  It was crowded at 11AM, with an almost bar-like atmosphere (think somewhat loud music, dim lights, and people talking over one another to be heard), but with really cute decor.  The staff were super friendly but as for the food, I guess I'm a little disappointed.  The menu was limited but as a coffee-addict, my eyes were immediately drawn to the Pick Me Up - a coffee crepe, while my boyfriend and friend both got the Breakfast Burrito (or was it burro?) - one with an add-on of potatoes, another with chorizo.  We waited about 30 minutes for our three crepes, straining to hear our names being called over the noise of the crowd, and by that time, we were starving.  And the portions were pretty small and not quite brunch-worthy.  The Breakfast Burrito was pretty good and tasted much better than my Pick Me Up but the potatoes were too salty for my friend's taste.  My coffee crepe didn't taste very coffee-like except for the two dollops of coffee-flavored whipped cream on the side.  The crepe itself didn't seem to have anything in it, which was the main source of my disappointment.  In a nutshell, great staff, great service, cute place, rather noisy, but more of a dessert place rather than a breakfast place just because of the portion sizes, and just be prepared for the wait.",

As we were finishing up our crepes, the server came out with a plate of rose marshmallows and a torch. He roasted the marshmallows right in front of our eyes and left after saying \"It's on the house. Enjoy guys! ;)\" I also checked in on Yelp and got my delicious lemongrass tea for free.  It is my second time here and it's just getting better everytime. Love it!",

    "text": "Since my first visit in January, I've decided that whenever I'm visiting Phoenix, I'll dedicate a good hour of my day to my newest quartier general (spot), Crepe Bar. Crepe Bar's carte du jour manifests an aesthetic and novel approach to the French pancake classic commonly known as the crepe. The creperie-cafe ushers in sweet and stirring encounters, both culinary and social.  On that account, I turn the spotlight on to Shelby for the moment. Barista Shelby Moore serves up seasonally harvested Heart Coffee in baby blue and orangesicle- colored cups and suitably signs each brew with a heart. The Arizona native is a connoisseur of good food and surely good coffee; the French title gourmand describes him in every respect. Shelby's penchant for the culinary experience translates into effective editorial columns. The Class of 2014 scholar at ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication recently contributed to the March issue of Bite, a local food and drink magazine.   Each meal on Crepe Bar's menu brings into play the winning features of its cuisine. The creperie's attention to texture is exemplified in each crunch and each chew; hints of masala and vanilla bean prove its palate full-flavored.  I dedicated an hour to this hot spot with my friend Navi, indulging in a heart-to-heart over our jazzy cups of Heart Coffee. The window-side table for two provided a modest breeze and warm glow of sunshine.",

    "text": "Worst Experience. I was looking for a good new place to take my husband for a birthday breakfast. After reading amazing reviews we were excited and not surprised by the lengthy line when we arrived. I was surprised by how small and dingy it was inside, we could hardly just stand in line without bumping into someone. Due to the lack of tables, crying babies, and claustrophic atmosphere we decided to just order the food to go. After waiting 15 minutes we get ready to order and are told there is a 45 minute wait for food and tables!  When I asked about to go orders we were told its a limited menu, but it could be ready in 25 minutes. We tried to get the first time crepe without bananas and with strawberries because my husband is allergic to bananas, but we were informed there are no substitutions. Unfortunately, this meant no Nutella crepe was available to us on the to go orders. With no area to wait I asked if I could provide my number and get a text when the food was ready, they wouldn't do that and stated it would be ready in 25 minutes and to just leave and come back.  We set an alarm and went elsewhere for coffee. I returned 30 minutes later and was told sorry it's no where near ready come back in at least 15 maybe 20 minutes. At this point I almost cancelled the order, but we were starving.  We returned 20 minutes later (so it's now an hour since we had first arrived) and the food is sitting there.  We grab the food and rush home to find the food luke warm and the crepe soggy.  Such a disappointment.",

I had the coffee because it is free when you check in on Yelp (you can also choose tea.) The crepe, as you can see in the pics, was perfectly cooked. Thin, delicate, and slightly browned. The most prominent flavor was the cheddar cheese. My only critique would be that it could use more pesto, but it was still damn good. Also, the Heart (based out of Portland, OR) coffee was delicious and was a medium brew with a light oily layer.   The atmosphere may be just as fine as the food. The music was great and playing from an employee's iPod. I heard the Beatles, Gene Chandler, and Fela Kuti, a pioneer of Afrobeat music, among others. The wall art and friendly faces were courtesy of Andy Brown, who also did the murals on the Cabanas on McClintock in Tempe.   The staff was friendly and helpful. The price and portions are right. I'll be back and looking forward to trying their \"sweet\" crepes.",

    "text": "Came here based on fellow Yelpers reviews on a Sunday about an hour prior to the 2pm closing.  The place was packed, and I mean packed. All the tables were taken and the line was six deep.  The staff was extremely joyous and appeared to be enjoying the rush.  A staff member actually saved a table for us when one became available. The menu was easy to navigate and had something for everyone in my family. Previous reviews mentioned that the menu had lots  pork items, so we were prepared for slim pickings since were are a mostly vegetarian non pork eating (mainly personal reasons not religious) family.   However, there were plenty of items that fit the bill. My sons ordered and devoured the FIRST TIME (nutella, banana brulee) and the VANILLA BEAN CUSTARD with marinated strawberries and salted caramel.  My wife and I ordered the 13 MILE (Steadfast farm veggies plus French masala and buckweat crepes) and the BUCKWHEAT piquantee, mushroom ragout with horseradish havarti. The 13 Mile was surprisingly complex with French and South Indian flavors I certainly normally would not have made a crepe out of on my own, and the Buckwheat was savory, and had the right amount of cheese.  They brought out a granola sample that was light and house made with apricot slices ( fantastic) and also the House Brioche sampler which was too hard to eat-  about three times harder than an old crouton.  I am not sure what that was about.  Checking in on Yelp earned us a free coffee or tea.  Its a big bummer they have no decaf coffee or espresso.",

I remember the Guji by Heart being amazing. They also know how to steam their milk well. No large bubbles in my milk!

    "text": "Not at all impressed.  This is a very limited menu.  We shared a breakfast crepe burrito with cb fries (about 15 very small chunks of home fried potatoes sprinkled on top).  The presentation was pretty, and aside from a mouthful of a heavy salt seasoning that was on the plate, it wasn't bad.  We also shared a dessert crepe with fruit compote.  The crepe was served cold (????) and I didn't have more than one bite. It tasted like raw dough.   It was that bad.  The \"communal\" granola that a server brought over after we had ordered was just odd.   I don't want to eat granola with my fingers as my tablemate dips into the same dish with her fingers.  Weird.    An employee was standing outside the window by our table the entire time we were there.   She was writing the summer hours in the window, and it took her a long time.   We had a view of her underarms while we ate. Seriously.  Additionally, the door was propped open the whole time, and a fly was all over our table.   I think that maintenance work should be done out of the view of customers.  Can't the hours be added to the window BEFORE the place opens?  Shut the door, too.  Common sense, really.  I went to this place at the recommendation of an acquaintance and will not be back.",

Great decor and pleasant people in the restaurant as well. The group I went there for breakfast with stayed there for a good hour after we finished eating. The staff was very friendly. The time between ordering and being served the food was a bit longer than desired, but the wait was well worth it. The breakfast burro is one of the best breakfast items I've ever tasted, particularly because of the avocado and chipotle sauce. The brioche with fresh jam was also delicious, one of the best jams I've ever tasted and the brioche was toasted perfectly. I intend on eating here the next time I am in the Tempe area.",

The restaurant is really small and didn't seem to have any air conditioning and was very stuffy, and we went in December. Ordered 2 crepes and two drinks and the price was just over $20. the place wasn't overly crowded and it took a good 20 minutes before our crepes showed up, and when they did I wasn't overly impressed. We got the Papa K which was a decent amount of food, as well as the maple butter, which was just a plain crepe with some syrup over it. They weren't bad, but not anything to make me recommend the place and to go back. I'd say for what we got a price around $15 would be more reasonable as well.",

Being that my experience w savory crepes comes from the Pacific NW, Portland and Seattle, I've been spoilt apparently. Because it's soo difficult to take common breakfast fixins, like eggs, sausage, cheese, spinach and marry them into a perfect french pancake called a savory crepe!!! These ppl need to take a serious trip to the NW and see the offerings of 20+ crepe combinations AND the \"build your own\" option ALWAYS included on the street fair menus at the farmer's market! I guess as long as ppl in Tempe do not travel and have crepes anywhere else, then this place will do well. Hubby liked his grand prix and wanted me to share that in my review. I'm terribly disappointed in my savory bfast crepe maybe the sweet ones are there niche idk. I won't be back to find out! Place was clean, servers friendly, (except when you ask to alter the crepe your ordering) cappuccino lacking in foam and rich flavor... Blah I'm going to dutch bros for a real damn coffee now. ;-)",

Service on the weekend can be slow, but when I was here on a recent Friday morning, the restaurant was busy without being crowded, and the servers were attentive and prompt.  I've had the breakfast burrito crepe a couple times in the past (four stars - spicy, savory, and very filling!), and decided to get the andouille sausage one this time.  It was good -- generous amounts of sausage, a perfectly-cooked sunny-side-up egg on top, nice spicy kick -- but a little bit too salty.  I mentioned it to one of the servers, and she said it was just that the sausage itself was that salty; they don't salt the dish, except for a sprinkling of sea salt on top of the fried egg.  I ate about 90%, then put it aside to turn my attention to the lemon crepe.  I've had these before with just a simple spritz of lemon juice and a dusting of sugar, but Crepe Bar's version was a little more elaborate: the crepes had a kind of a lemon custard in them that was really good.  It was very sweet (could have been a little bit more tart, but still, I finished every bite!).    Everything here is plated beautifully.  And, every time I've come here, a server has circulated around the restaurant offering free amuse bouche to diners.   This time, it was a maple coffee cake with vanilla custard; very nice!  The food is a little pricy, but it's clear that they care about quality and pay attention to details here. I will be back!",

The cold brew coffee was good coming from a coffee novice, and my girlfriend was a fan of the regular coffee and she is an avid coffee drinker. When I tasted my crepe, I was floored. I ordered the Crepe Burro, chipotle crepe wrapped around bacon, eggs, avocado, and pepper jack cheese. Not to mention the chipotle sea salt and sauce. My girlfriend got the vanilla bean custard with strawberries, and roasted walnuts. We each tried a little of each other's and agreed that we would be back to try the other options and have already found two favorites.",

Food - Everything.  Try everything. But don't try the Banana and Nutella because you will want it every morning after.  Drink - Not much of a latte or cappuccino fan. Only reason due to I was a barista in the past and wore myself out. However that cold brew in the fridge to the right. Oh my god. Really if I could buy it in the 6-pack. No seriously. I'll pay money for that. Damn good.  Service - Hands down the best. I felt like I was at a friends house. They took care of us.  Presentation - You had me blown away. That food presentation was culinary perfection. The granola even on that slate platter was beautiful.  (If I wasn't so heavy,  i would of took it)   Your local. You treated us well. Places like this I don't speak of due to i don't want you get played out. But you, I'm shouting at the roof tops.   Sidenote - Our food did take sometime. But look at that kitchen size.

I wanted to get a custom crepe for breakfast but it seemed expensive when you added ham and eggs to the basic $6.50 crepe so I ordered a breakfast burrito and was very happy with the smokey chipotle flavor.  Agree, the wait is long for such a small restaurant.  Tea prices were a bit confusing and the price is high for something that didn't seem refillable.  Understand why most were drinking free water.

The only downside is the wait after 9am but you get that wherever the food is awesome.",

Having made crepes at home, I knew what I was looking for. This place surpassed my expectations. The crepes are very yummy and not rubbery like the crepes I tried in one of the crepe places in Michigan. We tried sweet crepes, next time we will come to try their savory crepes. Presentations is very appealing too! Love combination of casual atmosphere and sophisticated looking food!",

    "text": "I can very clearly trace back to when I first fell in love in with crepes.  Though it wasn't at a creperie like Crepe Bar per se.  It was at one of Phoenix's best pizzerias.  Cibo in Downtown Phoenix offers a variety of sweet dessert crepes for those still with an appetite after a 12\" pizza (*raises hand*).  The first crepe I ever had at Cibo was their Fresca crepe.  Warm crepe dough (basically a thin sheeted pancake) wrapped around vanilla ice cream, a variety of fruits and then topped with whipped cream, sugar, and even more fruit.  The portion was huge and the flavors were heaven sent.  It was a beautiful (if unexpected) dessert that I never would've expected to see at a pizzeria.  Since then, I've had my fair share of crepes from various restaurants including JoBot Coffee, Vovomeena, Duza's Kitchen, Vincent Market Bistro, and others.  Crepe Bar is my first foray into a crepe specific establishment.  Seemed like a good lunch option on a Sunday so off I went.  The restaurant sits in an unassuming strip center on the northwest corner of Elliot and Rural in Tempe.  It doesn't look like much from the outside (and was a little hard to spot at first), but the packed parking lot gave me some indication that I was in the right spot. Walking inside, the long line confirmed my suspicions.  A line about 20 deep at Noon on Sunday and the tables were packed.  There's probably seating for close to 60 or 70, but I needed some luck to get one.  Here you order at the front and they bring the food out to you.  By the time I ordered at the register, a stool at the front counter opened up so I raced to grab it.  Just prior to that, I examined the menu while waiting in line to make my choices.  No sides or non-crepe items for me this go around.  Today I was going to order one item from the savory crepe menu and an item from the sweet crepe menu.  The \"Limited Availability\" crepes in particular caught my attention thanks to the complex mix of ingredients each offers.  For my savory crepe, it was the Crepe-Stada.  A crepe that is fried like a tostada, topped with paprika chicken, black beans, avocado, greens, a fried egg, cotija cheese and a mix of chipotle and hot sauces.  For my sweet crepe, I chose the Ode To A Sundae (yes I know its Sunday, I'm corny like that).  This one is a chocolate crepe stuffed with bananas and caramel over a bed of vanilla custard, and topped with berries, more bananas, chocolate chips, and candied pistachios.  Total cost for the food and tax came to about $21.  Food took about 10 minutes to come out since they were crazy busy.  The portions for both of these weren't quite on the level of a Cibo or a JoBot (at least relative to price), but the plate presentation for both was quite lovely.  The Crepe-Stada was helped a bunch by the sauces that were poured on the side.  By itself, the beans, egg, and chicken were somewhat benign, but the chipotle and hot sauces both added just what the dish needed for a little extra kick.  Portion was fairly small, but the dish was nevertheless satisfying.  The Ode by contrast was a much more generous portion and had a lovely texture.  I was especially happy with the mounds of pistachios and berries.  Only thing I might've done differently with this dish is perhaps integrate a fruity custard instead of vanilla (say mango or apple or something along those lines).  Otherwise, a solid sweet crepe offering.  Overall, owner Jeff Kraus has done some good work putting his obsession with crepes to good use.  Some of the crepe dishes are better than others, but I can appreciate the creativity and the fearlessness he puts into a number of his crepe experimentations.  I wouldn't quite put Crepe Bar up with my most elite crepe favorites (Cibo's are especially tough to top), at least not yet.  But the place has potential.  And though it might seem like a small thing, it would probably be worth it for them to hire a wait staff rather than let everyone wait in line and fend for themselves for seating (today especially was quite a free for all).  Till then, here's hoping Crepe Bar keeps pushing the envelope on this humble (but delicious) thin sheet of pastry.",

Added the chorizo for a little kick. Was highly recommended and didn't disappoint. Flavors were all there and the burrito didn't stand a chance.   After my burrito tried the popular Nutella/banana brulee. A tad sweet if you're not used to it but delicious nonetheless. Highly recommend it.   Overall great experience and will gladly visit again.

    "text": "When I arrived to Arizona, the first thing that came to my mind was, \"This place is hot as balls! How do people survive here?!\" The weather was a smoldering 107 F and my car was dying a slow, heat induced death. It was only the first full day in the Grand Canyon State and I wanted to punch myself in the face for coming out here. But maybe I was simply this way because of the lack of nutrients in my belly. So I met up a friend at a place highly recommended by the locals and drove my poor car to Crepe Bar.  Deco: 4 stars  The moment you walk in, you're welcomed into a refreshing atmosphere. Not only is the air conditioning keeping this place cool, but the colors and art work also add to the aura of coolness. The colors are hues of blue with white background, the tables are refreshingly cold to the touch, and the front counter has a great homegrown feel to it that is welcoming to anyone, from local to tourist. I found out the scheme for the inside was supposed to feel like your eating outside because Crepe Bar started off as a food truck before having roots in a building. The framed art work on the walls are done by a local artist whom is quite famous but I forgot the name of. There's a lot of personality to just the deco and it was one of many examples I discovered of the creativity and artistic nature of the Arizona people.  Service: 5 stars  The service here was incredible. When I go somewhere new, especially far from my home, I like to talk to the locals and find out their stories. Add that with my unrelenting desire for food and I can get pretty inquisitive. But the staff here was amazing. Not only were they friendly, they were kick back and gave the type of service you only see in movies. Each person had a personality and wasn't only a face. There was pleasure and pride in the work they do and a sincerity that crossed over with their words and actions. It was great to interact with homosapiens who spoke to you without a facade. And the kicker to all this: while I was waiting for my food to come out, they brought out not only one, but TWO complimentary items of food while my friend and I sat and conversed. WHAT SWEETHEARTS!  Food: 4 stars  The food here was quite delicious, especially for the simplicity. They get the most flavors out of the ingredients they use and create something not just pretty, but also tasty. Although I'm not a huge fan of savory crepes, I was coerced to try out the chicken pesto crepe and greatly appreciated the choice. It was a great blend of herbs and chicken. The gooey cheese inside melted perfectly with the above mentioned ingredients and when the cheese hit the edges of the crepe, a delicious, crispy cheesy crust was created; a perfect contrast in flavor and texture to the rest of the crepe. The complimentary items were also small nibbles of what food they were experimenting with. Whether it was coffee grinds added to a cookie or the fresh granola made in house, the food was refreshing and delicious. Even now, I want to wrap my tongue around those flavors once more for there was genuine happiness in each bite.  Conclusion  Crepe Bar is a perfect example of how simple ingredients and amazing service can make a dining experience into one of pure joy. For me, Crepe Bar wasn't only a great lunch spot, but a place that opened my eyes to the creative side of Arizona that never gets mentioned. The people of Arizona have an eye for the artistic, a playfulness in their cooking, and a heart of sincerity. Crepe Bar showed me Arizona is filled with vast amount of stories to discover and I was excited, and still am, to see what more I discover.",

So we had to wait another 30 minutes for the second order to be out. The Heart coffee there is perhaps some of the best I've had. We even purchased a bag to take home. I'll give it another shot, they may just have been short staffed that day.",

    "text": "Crepe Bar had a fun, casual atmosphere with a mix of high top and low top tables in the small and crowded space, which was bustling when we went.  I loved the photo light boxes lining the north wall.  What I didn't love was the wait at this partial-service spot.  Granted, I chose 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday for my first visit, but I doubt it slows down much any other time on the weekends - at least it didn't during the hour-plus we were there.    Forty minutes after ordering two crepes, my coffee mug was empty (Crepe Bar brews Heart coffee, which is a bit acidic for my tastes, but enjoyable nonetheless), I'd downed three plastic cups of the room temperature self-serve water, and we'd long finished the small dish of complimentary granola (which, frankly, is difficult to eat.  I'd rather they rolled them with some honey or peanut butter and made bite-size granola balls - picking up the individual oats, raisins, and nut mixture was messy and unpleasant).  Although the friendly (and hipster (I saw a lot of skinny cuffed jeans, flannel, and thick-rimmed glasses) staff had nothing to do with the delay, as it was clear the small kitchen could never keep up with the demand out front, I was a bit irritated by the time my Andouille Sausage and Pick Me Up crepes finally arrived.  But then, as I said, the crepes arrived.  And they were delicious enough to make my long wait a distant memory.  The Pick Me Up crepe, a coffee crepe with tangy espresso mascarpone, was delightfully rich and the crepe perfectly prepared - I could barely finish my half because it was so decadent, but it was ideal for sharing.  The Andouille Sausage crepe was also perfectly light and fluffy with a fantastic flavor reminiscent of fresh pasta dough.  The savory flavors melded perfectly with the Andouille sausage and egg, although the pimiento cheese sauce was a bit salty.  The accompanying fingerling potatoes were perfectly cooked, tender but crisp, tossed in herbs and what tasted like garlic oil.  I could have devoured a whole plate.  Any lingering annoyance I had from the wait was wholly dissipated by the arrival of two complimentary mini rose marshmallows toasted tableside and served with an artful splattering of dark chocolate.  The rose flavor really shone through in the marshmallows and the sweet treat polished off our meal on a high note.  In sum, prepare to wait - and I mean wait - if you head to Crepe Bar for weekend brunch, but definitely wait - it's worth it.  The best crepes I've had in the Valley thus far.  I can't wait to go back (and wait) to try the rest of the menu.",

I'm not an expert on crepes, but I really enjoyed my \"Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage\"! It was bursting with flavors and beautifully plated! The portion was big for little ol' me, but probably perfect for a hungry adult person's breakfast. My companion's \"Second Time\" Nutella crepe was \"meh,\" too much sweet out-of-the-jar Nutella filling, in my opinion. Next time, we'll stick to their savory crepes instead!  The only negative point I have about this place, is the food did take a while to come to our table, but they compensated that with complimentary scones while we waited (perfect with our tea, btw), and of course we're hoping the time was spent to plate a perfect, artistic and delicious meal! Will definitely come back to this place to try more dishes!",

    "text": "Brunch on a Tuesday???? Yup!!! We were around the Tempe area for an early appointment so we decided to have brunch around Tempe as well. We decided to have crepes. If you want crepes, you go to a place that specializes on Crepes, right? If a place is called Crepe Bar, I guess that means they do good crepes.  We found the place off of S Rural. The place is small but can probably sit 50 people. The vibe of the place was upbeat. Music played in the background but it wasn't very loud. Just kept the place cozy and vibrant. The colors on the walls were appealing. Hues of blue and grey fill the place with accents of green, orange and pastel colors.  Let's talk about their food. It was AWESOME!!!! My first five star on Yelp. From the service, to the place and ofcourse the food... IT WAS AWESOME (it was so awesome I wrote it three times already). We had The Burro (savory), The Grand Prix (savory) and the Vanilla Bean Custard (sweet) crepe. We also had the Maya tea and the Hot caramel latte for our drinks.  The Burro... this is your breakfast burrito on a crepe. Crepe was chipotle flavored with scrambled eggs, chorizo, avocado and pepper jack cheese. I would have wanted a little more of the sauce used for plating. I feel that it really complimented the dish. The little sauce on my plate did not make the experience less enjoyable though. There was a surprising kick on every bite with a hint of sweetness from the crepe and savory delight from the chorizo. The avocado definitely completed that southwest flavor and added a refreshing flavor to the dish.  The Grand Prix was my favorite. I love the creamyness of the fat from the pork belly that was cooked to perfection. It melts in your mouth. There was also the added crunch from the maple glazed pork jowl. The pork glory is placed on a bed of coffee Crepe topped with a sunny side up egg. I would have loved it more if the egg was little runny but overall I would order it again and recommend it to everyone.   We ended our meal with the vanilla bean custard with strawberries, almonds and salted caramel. It wasn't too sweet considering the salted caramel and vanilla custard. The perfect bite would be a piece of crepe, a bite of strawberry, a dash of candied almonds, topped with custard and salted caramel. Everything just goes well together.  We would definitely come back. Maybe we'll bring friends with us next time to share our new found favorite Crepe bar in Arizona.  Certified yum for the buck!  more reviews on  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthemealexperience.blogspot.com%2F&s=8867c350c7aa0cabf43cb9c6f3f4f024c3769b2d907a79470d966a0ba14180f9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">themealexperience.blogsp...</a>",

Also picked up the chocolate chip cookie (theoretically given the size it was practically 2 cookies). It was flaky and oh so chocolaty.   Service was excellent and the waiters/waitresses were super nice. The only downside is given that this place is so popular, expect a wait for your food. My only suggestion is try and beat the rush, your stomach will thank you.",

I had the bacon and egg burrito, and it was the best I have ever had.  The crepe, the salsa and the sauce absolutely heavenly. We also tried the strawberry and creme crepe - deelish.  The crepe with ham and cheese - deelish!  The place is small and the decor minimal, but who cares when the food is that good. The staff - really nice and helpful. They even brought out some new desserts for us to test for free. It may take a little longer than you think it should to get your food...but I am telling you it is because they are working magic in the kitchen to get you their deeeelish crepes!  GO!!!! EAT!!!!!

As I stood at the counter looking over the menu Chef Jeff came out from behind the counter to share the details of his amazing menu. We order the special Duck and a wonder crepe with ham and mushrooms (it was about 2 months ago...so please forgive my lack of memory). We also indulged with a dessert dish that had strawberries, creme, nuts....YUM!  The dishes that Chef Jeff creates are full of flavor and creativity. I highly recommend that you take the time to stop in and try the Crepe Bar. I also heard that they had plans to open for dinner on select evenings and I can't wait to go back to give dinner a try.",

    "text": "Okay so it took me 3 trips to this place before I was able to get a crepe. The first time, we showed up 30 minutes before closing and were denied service of anything except coffee or the small pastries on the counter because the kitchen was closed. In a normal restaurant I can totally understand this, but it only takes 5 minutes and a hot plate to make a crepe so I was a bit turned off by this. The second time we showed up with plenty of time before closing. We were told that we could order crepes, but that it would be a 40 minute wait. We asked if there was a special occasion and they said that this is just a typical Saturday for them. Perhaps they should consider purchasing another hot plate? I love crepes, but not enough to wait 40 minutes. The third time we went was today and we finally got our crepes! My crepe was ice cold when I got it. My fiance's however was luke warm. The crepe, though it was cold, actually tasted good and I think it could have been great had it not been so cold. I've been to Paris numerous times and know what a good crepe tastes like. The service was great and the people were friendly and attentive, but I don't know that I'll be coming back. My overall experience with this place hasn't been the best.",

The Breakfast Burrito is served with a spicy sea salt that pushes it into the stratosphere. The First Time is nowhere near as \"desserty\" as it sounds, but very well done.  Regarding our service, I have mixed emotions. On one hand, I worked in the industry for 12 years, and my wife for 6, so we understand that things happen. We waited 27 minutes (according to our check-in...) before we asked because we're super patient; also, at that point it was completely obvious something was wrong - everyone in the place but us had food. They felt bad enough that they brought us a small bowl of granola to tide us over while we waited, and cookies with milk after we were done. These were very nice gestures. Where the mixed emotions come in is the fact that the waitress over-apologized. She said she was \"so sorry\" about the mixup every single time she came by, probably close to 10 total - once was enough.  We will definitely be back, and I'm sure the service will be much better. I doubt the food could get any better, though.",

Believing that peer-reviewed places are likely to be excellent, Peg and I checked out this place this am. The place was \"uber crowded,but Shelby greeted us cordially and gave us the info and layout of the land.  We knew that we wanted to sample both savory and sweet...and we are both coffee lovers as well..meaning lovers of GOOD coffee!! Heart coffee was wonderful. I had the sausage|local pork ~ pimento cheese~ roasted fingerling ~ easy egg crepe, and my bride sampled the papa k|local ham ~ mushroom ragout ~ pepperjack ~ dressed greens crepe. They were extraordinarily tasty. We did the usual sharing bites, and ended the meal with two sweet crepes: lemon x 3|butter + gel + zest and ^ vanilla bean custard|strawberries (straight up)...meaning you can add other goodies to the custard if you wish.  As importantly, the service and attitude of the people working there was stellar.  Shelby was very attentive and helpful (checking to make sure that our seating arrangement was acceptable) and  Brittney (I apologize in advance if there is a different spelling of your name!!!) and the server in the very nice \"Miles\" ( as in Miles Davis) were on top of things. The background music is a wonderful addition. All in all, this place is definitely worth a repeat/repeat/repeat visit!!!   BTW..it is literally next door to Pcroissant...another excellent choice.

Well I finally tried it today, and I have to say I don't understand why its so packed. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't in that great.  The Decour was cute, the line was long, the food wasn't bad but the portions were pretty sparse. I'm not looking for the grand slam breakfast, but a little bit more would be nice. Wait... I'm complaining about the food not being that great but yet I want more? Anyway...My daughter had the Nutella-banana Brule which was pretty tasty but a bit too sweet for me. I had the chipotle breakfast burro with roasted potatoes, and it just wasn't impressive on any level. The potatoes looked nice sparsely sprinkled on the plate, but they really needed to be in the burrito itself as well. On a bazaar note, at the end of the meal, they brought us out two tiny smidgens of marshmallows, broke out a blow torch, and lite up the mellow specks. Yummy...I love me some some roasted plastic. Not the worst but far from the best.",

    "text": "Crepe Bar is one of those unassuming cafes you drive by all the time and contemplate visiting, but never have.  The exterior is a strip mall without any anchor stores to draw you in. The gas station is there for a quick fill up and reminder that you still have never been to the Crepe Bar.  The interior is Spartan with small tables and metal chairs with cushions and high tops with matching metal stools.  The cash register is an iPad, and the tip jar is a pint glass.  There is also an artful flower arrangement on the counter with birds of paradise, and a cooler with cold drinks off to the side.  Some sweet treats beckon customers from the counter.  There also appears to be a rack with shirts near the entrance for sale.  The menu is also Spartan with a small variety of breakfast, lunch, and desert crepes.  There seem to be as many coffee and tea drinks as crepes, although you can also build your own crepe.  At lunch time on Friday and the place was busy.  I ordered the buffalo chicken.  It was good.  I'll have to try one of the desert crepes.",

Order took a while to serve up, but the waiter gave us some granola to munch on while we waited. My boyfriend got the first timer banana brulee with nutella and that was very good too. Coffee was just okay, not terribly impressive...probably would skip the coffee next time. But definitely would come back here for crepes. This place is very popular and crowded, but their food is worth the wait.",

The crepes were good but I'm not about to deal with that attitude again. If I had an employee like that I'd fire him on the spot.",

    "text": "i was excited about getting some good crepes in Tempe, but alas, was sorely disappointed by the outcome.  Assorted gripes in order of importance were 1) Pesto chicken was in fact 'curried' chicken. I make my own pesto and know the flavor quite well. No basil in the sauce which was basically a creamy light yellow curry sauce. What gives? 2)Plastic cups for drinks, 5 oz. for water and 16 oz. for purchased drinks. and the cheap flimsy cups you get in a hurry at Walgreens. Seriously? 3)No place setting on table, which, when requested only come with a knife and fork. (at least they were not plastic) No spoon, which i needed to stir my coffee. Another trip back to the kitchen.4) No sugar or sweeteners on the table. Had some in my wallet for these situations. 5) limited seating in which at least 3 tables were taken by Apple users with no food on the table. Did not Starbucks address this issue recently? I will just leave it at that for now. Hey, i do not expect the world at a crepe restaurant. But in my many years of eating out there are some BASIC things I have come to expect. When i do not get these basics i am not a happy camper. Had this place been open a short time i would give it  the benefit of the doubt. But i find more and more Phx diners have come to expect the minimum, and in the end, that is exactly what they get.",

We enjoyed the \"Breakfast Burrito\" which is a bit of a misnomer, as it's a crepe, but our other choice was the \"Papa K\" which I'm still dreaming about. Local ingredients, like fantastic local ham. Check out the tiny little 'doughnuts' which are really more like teeny beignets with cinnamon sugar.  OK - some have commented that service is slow.  It's made to order, so yeah, it's gone take a little more time.  So Mr. Cranky, don't come here when you're in a hurry!  But come when you have time to relax with a cup of delicious coffee while your meal is prepared  It's super hard to ding this place.  Worth seeking out, and worth the wait I promise.  Now if we could just convince them to open for dinner...That would be a beautiful thing!",

    "text": "The food at this place is worth 5 stars WOW!  The breakfast burrito is perfect and the nutella and banana crepes are amazing!  They are topped with a sugary crunch that is absolutely addicting. What is not good is the coffee.  It's kind of sour and tastes more like Dunkin Donuts to me (if you're into that sort of thing go for it).  They also don't have cream to add to it which I thought was weird.  They don't have silverware out and I had to maneuver my way up to someone who looked busy and annoyed when I asked for it. The other thing I don't like is that it's too popular for the space.  It is PACKED and the line makes it impossible for the servers to even bring out the food.  Time to expand I think.  I also hate that the menu is not on display and is impossible to get a hold of from the back of the line.  There is however a list of hand drawn cartoons of all the people working there.  Quirky? Yes.  Helpful?  Not so much.   Sounds like a lot of complaints I know, but that food is just that good that you MUST try it despite the setbacks.",

I found this restaurant searching yelp and decided to give it a try do to it's overwhelming rave reviews. It's a bit too small of a place for my taste accommodation wise. I like a little room while I am eating. The lighting is very dim and not very good for a restaurant. Kind of feels like you're in a dark cave. It was a Saturday morning so you can expect a wait time, which ours was about 30 minutes before our food arrived. Unfortunately, mine came with it really long piece of hair all curled up on the very top of it. The server took it back and brought me a new meal in a couple minutes just as the rest of our order was ready. Besides all the lack of attraction to this place & my mystery topping I quite enjoyed my meal. We had ordered 2 breakfast burritos, 2 egg and cheese crepes and some nutella crepes with bananas. The breakfast burritos and the chocolate banana crepes were quite impressive. The egg and cheese crepes were a bit greasy and also had a bit of spice to them. Being that we had typical kids with us, it's hard to find something on the menu that would satisfy picky plain children so if you have these you might want to consider feeding them before or go for the gusto and give them a sugar rush of chocolate. All in all, I really did enjoy the food. I think this place is best if kept for people with a flair for food but probably not children. I will return and flavor this place again but with out the kids",

It was a relatively long wait time, but the super delicious food made up for it, as well as the cool waiters.  Service. For the service, it was a tad bit slow. But we were served some complimentary granola bits thing. That was cool. The waiters also had good personality. I can tell they liked to serve the public by the way they talked and how they constantly checked up on the customers.   As for the food, I ordered a basil chicken crepe. It was sooooo great. I love it. I would eat it again, but I'm gonna try their other selections next time. The two people that went with me ordered a brioche with strawberry jam and lemon drop crepe and also a burro crepe. Those also looked super delicious.   Overall, this place is so nice and the food is most likely made with love and care given the amount of time it took to cook our food. Time doesn't matter when food is this great. You should come here and eat.",

    "text": "After eating at La Creperie Voila in Seattle last month, I developed a hankering for crepes! This place did not disappoint!   We came in around 9am Sunday morning expecting a very long wait. I had my boyfriend grab the first table available as I stood in line. There were about 7-8 people ahead of me. After about 15 minutes, I placed our order for 4 crepes and a latte. As we were waiting, one of the servers brought us a little treat of mixed nuts and granola. Pretty tasty but I wanted real food! Surprisingly, our order came only a mere 15 minutes later! I was skeptical before trying this place out because the wait was the biggest complaint from the majority.  The Papa K was tasty. Unfortunately, I had ham for dinner the night before and there was ham in the Papa K. It was kind of a turn off. I should have actually read what was in this before ordering. BUT the wonderfully marinated mushrooms saved the dish. It also came with a pleasant arugula salad on the side. My bf had the breakfast burro. It was good, but the guac made it very mushy. Add the potatoes.   Time for dessert crepes! I finished the Papa K and I definitely finished the vanilla cream crepe (with strawberries). The maple crepe (with bananas) was also a winner, but because I was so full from my two, I only had one bite. Boo.   I would like to return soon and hopefully I won't have to wait long again :)",

Honestly, all the feelings about this place is all in Brett B. and Joyce W. reviews. This place is AH-MAY-ZING! Cody was such an awesome server, I enjoyed the Chicken Basil Crepe (savory) and the Lemon Crepe (sweet & sour - which I love these combos!) and a free Maya Tea (iced) with my first check-in! We all shared what was on our plates and everything was delicious - from the Salted Radishes with the Cultured Butter all the way to the Homemade Chocolate that you swirl up in their own homemade Caramel Sauce!  Good food, good friends, crisp and refreshing atmosphere - inside and out - it made my Friday brighter, and I went home with a full stomach and rosy cheeks from all the laughter and good times I had with the group and the Crepe Bar staff (they rock)!  Definitely coming back here to try the rest of the menu out, cannot wait till that next paycheck rolls in!",

We were well attended to from the host, to the server, and even the bus boy. Everyone was friendly and smiling, even on a busy holiday.

Even so, when we were up to order the staff helped us make the right choices.  Boy were they right.   Menthol and hazelnut brownie- wow Free granola while we waited for food- tasty  Coffee- some of the best around, honestly Smoked turkey crepe- just fantastic   The staff is on top of things, is friendly, and knows their menu well. The food is incredible. The prices are low. Very low. And the ambiance is good enough. Styled well, (read \"hip\") and is cozy.   Can't wait to go back.",

I unfortunately felt a bit rushed to finish my food fast so that people could have my table.  I ordered a Nutella crepe in hopes that I could add strawberries. The lady informed me that they couldn't add the berries. Grrrr. Not a big deal but I just couldn't understand why I couldn't at least have the berries on the side or something.... I also ordered an iced latte and they served me a hot one. Also wasn't a big deal because I did enjoy the floral design they created with the latte foam.    The atmosphere and food were definitely good. A place I'll want to try again eventually.",

    "text": "Looking for something different and lighter than our usual brunch fare, my husband and I checked out the Crepe Bar. I'm not sure why this place has more than 3 stars except, perhaps, for the concept, or what it once may have been as a food truck.  Right off the bat I had a few problems with this place. 1) We had never eaten there and had to figure out the protocol. Since there were no menus by the door, only at the register, ordering was a slow process. We felt rushed and pressured to make a decision quickly. Not ideal. 2) It is overpriced for a seat yourself \"restaurant\" and had insufficient seating with no organized area or mechanism to wait w/o standing over other diners. They should decide if they're fast food or conventional dining, then price and plan accordingly. 3) Cafeteria-style, grab your own utensils, but no spoons or sugar packets for coffee, which left people to grab the sugar cubes with their hands. Yuck.  Food: I had the chocolate crepes, which were mostly flavorless (chocolate only in color), filled with a lengthwise slice of banana on a barely there bed of whipped cream, topped with the rest of the banana, one sliced strawberry, and a drizzle of caramel. The presentation was nice, but it was very dry. My husband had the burrito crepe, which he seemed to enjoy. We shared the tiniest side of potatoes...I'm sorry, 3 dollars for 1/2 a potato (literally) with thousand island-like dressing - come on. Add 2 mimosas and 2 coffees and we were $50 poorer and feeling just, meh.  All that said, in balance I probably would have given them three stars - we've had better and we've certainly had worse. That is, until a couple came into the restaurant with their dog.  I asked the hostess about their policy with respect to pets, and she confirmed that, excepting service animals, dogs were not allowed in the restaurant, which would be according to Maricopa County health code. She said the couple came in to place their order, and would be sitting outside on the \"patio\" afterwards. No problem, until they didn't, and instead went to the other side of the restaurant and took a table.  I went up the counter and asked to speak to a manager, who refused to come out of the back room. I pointed out the health code (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maricopa.gov%2FDocumentCenter%2FView%2F5895%2FAnimals-in-Food-Establishments-PDF&s=18d1ddce0857e1df2e71f10d6bc3e0a61b4098fada837d1347d58d60f7980b6a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">maricopa.gov/DocumentCen...</a>) to the barista (the poor guy who was left to deal with the now incensed customer) and he graciously went over to speak to the guy. We were advised the couple was \"affiliated\" with the restaurant, and that the dog was a service animal. Right. Fine. Whatever. But even service dogs are not allowed to sit on the furniture and/or eat from non-disposable dishes. When I shared that information with him, he went back over to the couple and asked them to remove the dog from the seat. He returned to our table and advised us that they would comply, so I asked him to turn around so that he could see that they did not.   I recognize that this is a very dog friendly area, and that's why there is a clause in the health code to provide dog-friendly patios if that is a restaurant's preference. Pets should not be in restaurants, unless they are working. Period. People have allergies or aversions, and should not have to share their eating space with someone else's pet. Further, people who characterize their pets as service animals for their own selfish purposes, do ACTUAL service animals a HUGE DISSERVICE. And, the fact that the management did nothing, placing the desire of their friend over the health of their other customers was disrespectful and bad business. That they don't care about violating the health code also makes me wonder where else they cut corners.",

It was perfect, not too sweet and flavorful with a great texture.  Its noisy, like all the industrial designed places are, but it's small, so that helps.  I could tell many people are returning customers,  comfortable with the arrangement of ordering and seating.   There is no cushioning on the chairs!  There are a few tables outside.  The coffee is decent.",

The first time I got the banana Nutella crepe and the second time I got the chorizo crepe, I also got lattes whilst I was here. I cannot remember the initial latte I ordered but I remember them getting it confused with chai about three times and I actually think I got served a chai tea latte instead of what I requested. I like chai so I didn't particularly mind but my only complaint about the chai was that at the bottom of the latte, during my final sip of it, there was so much cinnamon I felt like I did the cinnamon challenge all over again. If they chai wasn't gonna wake me up, that definitely did. The second time I ordered the chorizo crepe and oh my goodness, so good. I would definitely come back!",

Arriving around 10:30am on Saturday, they were busy but found some tables.  You order first then find a table. I don't like the fact they want to tip at the time of order but I didn't have cash with me to tip later. Very clean and casual ambiance inside. Two bathrooms, unisex, very clean as well. I know as I used both during my short visit.  Service was very friendly. They brought some sort of chips while waiting. I ordered Papa-K crepes for my breakfast simply because it was most reviewed dish. I really liked a little salt they put on the side. Not sure what kind salt it was, I tasted just salt by itself and thought it was good one.  Crepe was good but it didn't have that wow factor to it. Perhaps I expected too much based on really good reviews.   It was a quite out of my way to get here, not sure if I would return but if I were in the area, would consider coming back. Really friendly service here, perhaps my tastebuds were off for that moment.",

    "text": "Right now, I am so jealous of Tempe folks and other Eastsiders for having access to the Crepe Bar. I had one of the most delectable meals this morning.  Crepe Bar sports a cool and bohemian decor. Local artists' work are curated in their walls. Sign up to follow them on Instagram (the Crepe Bar) to find out when they have opening receptions.  Back to the artfully crafted meal, after checking out recommendations from my fellow Yelpers, I decided on the Papa K and the Sugar to satisfy my sweet tooth.  As I waited, they brought out a bowl of complimentary homemade granola, rich with dried fruit, grains, cereal, pistachios and almonds with honey. It was moist and was satisfyingly chewy and crunchy!  Now for the spiel on the Papa K. This beautifully designed plate arrived with a crepe wedge that had some crunch on the edge and crepe soft on the inside. They also dress it with a cheese crisp on the edge. Just how do they do that? The filling was divine, eggs, tasty ham and gooey cheese. Each bite flirted on almost being too salty but was perfect when paired with the lightly dressed greens with vinaigrette and caramelized onions. If you really crave salt, the have a spot of dealt salt and pepper at the edge of the plate. I have been forever corrupted, for I intend to serve a side salad with greens from now on.   The Sugar was divine. While the savory was mostly soft with a touch of crunch, this dessert crepe was crunchy with a touch of soft. Lightly powdered with a hint of citrus was how this sweet confection was dressed.  Congratulations to chef and owner, Jeff and the Crepe Bar team for delivering an AMAZINGLY meal. If you live on the east side, please note how to envious this Westsider is of you. Tip: If you don't want to fight the crowds, weekday mornings at 7 is a perfect time to dine.",

Thankfully, they got here before me and were able to get in the long line to order. It was busy but didn't seem to take that long to move through the line and place our orders. We ordered a variety of food; one got the brioche toast, another got the eggs and poached fruit, and I ordered the vanilla bean crepe. We also ordered tea (earl grey and mint) and the Moroccan spiced latte).  After we paid, we found a table in the corner and grabbed another chair from a table that wasn't using it. I love the remodel, they expanded the restaurant which allowed for twice as much seating. There was even a table outside, which was cute. Despite the amount of people ordering and in the place, our orders didn't seem to take too long. The teas came out very quick of course but the latte did take time. My friends and I enjoyed our dishes; I absolutely loved mine and how it was caramelized to give it a marshmallowy flavor. Service was good and the atmosphere was fun yet intimate enough for our conversation. My friends gave this place positive feedback.   Yay crepe bar!",

I've never been disappointed and today is no exception.   I'd like to compliment the expansion! The extended space is much appreciated since so many people demand this deliciousness.   The menu changes with ingredient availability. Today I tried a savory crisp crepe with local burrata cheese, pesto, a chutney, and mixed greens. Everything is painstakingly dressed to let the textures and flavors sing.   I hate that each bite means less food left on the plate.   The complimentary granola is a great touch. I'm not a coffee person and am pleased with their Earl Grey blend!   Love love love the crepe bar! Their hours are limited so plan ahead- you won't regret it.",

We should have known better, as it is Sunday, but we had no idea how popular this place was. For very good reason too! There was no available seating when we ordered our food, so one of the employees assessed the area and kindly asked a table if they could make some room for other customers.   We ordered some drinks, a latte and a quad espresso. The latte was one of the best I have had in Phoenix. The espresso was rather bitter and sour/acidic, which wasn't exactly what we were used to. We asked the same employee about it, which we were slightly hesitant to do seeing as though they were so busy. He was incredibly accommodating, offering to make a double espresso to see if that better suited our taste. He also gave us a cup of coffee to try in addition -- and left us with a to-go coffee to enjoy on the road. We did enjoy the taste of the coffee over the espresso, but that is likely due to our taste buds rather than the skill of their barista, who was also very kind.   Overall, the coffee was good, the food was amazing, and the service was the best I have experienced in a very long while. We are bummed to be moving away from Arizona and we wish we could bring this place with us! We'll definitely recommend this place to our pals and drop in during future travels.",

The cool, hip vibe is reminiscent of something out of San Francisco or Seattle, but with a staff that is both personable and efficient, I'd readily choose Crepe Bar any day of the week. This is a definite must for anyone in the Phoenix area -- or in my case, from DC.",

The only thing I would change is the portion sizes. I think they put a lot of presentation into the dish and not enough food. But, they gave us granola when we were waiting and a lemon bar when we were talking after we ate. That really made up for the small portion. Anyway, really good place. I will definitely return.",

The much raved about breakfast burrito just didn't do it for me (it was pretty to look at, but the flavor was monotone, the amount of cheese overwhelming and only half melted in a layer on the bottom of the lukewarm crepe instead of mixed in with the eggs), and the drip coffee was lighter than I personally prefer.  I'll definitely be back to try their sweet selections and cold brew, though.  Crepe Bar is a really cute spot and a good addition to the area.",

There was not a seat to be found inside or out. Nor is there a waiting area, so get over feeling bad about hovering over someone. And there isn't a wait list, so yes, you might have to slide into a seat before someone fully vacates it. Aaaannnd there seems to be some etiquette lacking--people sitting at tables waiting for to-go orders, people camping out for hours (not really the place to do that, you selfish six top). What can I say? I like some rules, or someone in charge at the restaurant who keeps things moving along.  We waited 40 minutes for our food. I took a phonecall outside and while I was on the phone, a server walked up and asked where I was sitting. She then delivered the dessert crepe to my husband. Starving, I sat down and started in. Then someone else reappeared to tell me I was EATING SOMEONE ELSE\"S FOOD. I was mortified. They brought it to me! She took it away.  10 min later our food appeared. I took a bite. It was pure bliss. I mean, just incredible. Really gourmet taste, beautifully plated. 5 star food, but I give 1 for service (slow and bad) and atmosphere (I should not have to fight for a damn table). We won't be back--the food wasn't worth the hassle and embarrassment.",

I wanted something sweet and something salty, but didn't' want to look like an insane cow for ordering both types, so I convinced my sweet husband into ordering the sweet crepe I was eyeing while I ordered the savory.  He ordered the strawberry creme and I ordered the chicken crepe. To make this simple, we didn't order enough.   The only reason I took one star away is although the employees were kind, they were very unorganized and there wasn't enough seating. The told us that they would find a seat, and so we didn't try to hawk our own table, we waited. A young couple came after us and while one ordered the other stood right next to the table that the server had told us they would clear for as soon as they had gone, so when they left, the young girl sat on the chairs and hailed someone else to clean the table for them. The server looked at us and shrugged and told us he would find another seat.",

We woke up pretty early on a Sunday and I wasn't expecting it to be so packed. So it's the kind of restaurant where you order and pay first then a serve brings you be food.   It has a very hipster feel and if you check in on yelp they give you a free coffee or tea. We got the pomegranate green tea, loved it. The tea wasn't watery as most ice teas are. I  have yet to try the coffee apparently it's all European.   We got the savory breakfast burrito and papa k with scrambled eggs. The crepes were amazing !!!   Breakfast burrito- I thought the breakfast burrito was a bit overwhelming because of all the avocado but my boyfriend who is a big fan of avocado loved it, the chipotle sauce perfectly complimented the flavors. He felt that the avocado balanced the crepe very well resulting in it not being too overwhelming. So I guess this one is open to your own opinion.  Papa k - inside was ham, pepper jack, scrambled eggs, cheese, and mushroom ragout. My first bite was the sides where they crisped up the cheese. Explosion of flavor in your mouth. It was satisfying from beginning to end. Must try !   In past experience savory crepes are always good at the beginning and overwhelming at the end.  Did not feel that here ! I finished every single bite.   Overall a must try, long wait but your stomach will thank you after.",

The food is consistently outstanding and the staff is always friendly. They usually offer a complimentary small bite to eat before your main meal comes out, which is appreciated. This is also one of the best places in town to get coffee as they carry beans from Heart roasters. The only downside is that can get crowded.

There were lots of terms I've never heard of before (like pork jowl), so it took me a while to figure out what to order. I ended up going with the smoky. And, while the coffee was quick to be made, the only sweetener they had was this really weird stuff in a green package. But after about 10 minutes, the food arrived and then I could see why the place got such good reviews, the food was excellent! And the staff was very friendly!  Pros: *  excellent food *  very friendly staff *  an amazingly little surprised treat (see picture) *  coffee refills ARE free, even though that's not obvious  Cons *  pricey, this place is at least $$, if not $$$ *  bad sweetener for the coffee *  confusing menu *  you pay for your good & tip BEFORE you can evaluate how the service is, so, here's a tip, pick 0%tip when offering & leave the top in cash at the table  Overall, the most important part of any restaurant is the tastiness of food, followed by the service you get, and in those 2 categories, this place Rocs the Casbah!",

When you enter, you seat yourself and someone visits to let you know to order at the register. Quick process, though the orientation could have been a bit smoother with a sign up front.  We also struggled to find a table big enough for four-- couple two-tops available in different areas, so we went with a three-top and used a lap.  You also get some snack granola that we liked.  We had the Breakfast Buro, Smokey, Curd, and Vanilla Crepe.  Smokey was the best of the bunch. Habenero sauce I added to the Buro added heat without flavor. The Vanilla crepe had very little vanilla or chocolate (add-on) flavor, but was still worthy overall.  Again, food was good, if unremarkable.  People were super pleasant.  It's one of those places that is really close to fan-worthy, but is one step away.  Just can't find a way to say four stars or higher.",

The staff is super nice and they gave us samples of their treats as we were waiting for our food. They have free WiFi and are fine with you hanging out for a couple of hours as we did.  I was looking for something light as I had too much ice cream the night before and was feeling sorta quesy. I opted for the vegetable curry crepe which turned out to be a tasty crepe full of beets and parsnips with a slight hint of curry. The vegetables were tender but not overcooked. The crepe came with a garnish of some turnip pickle (absolutely fantastic) and a parmesan cheese crisp. The portion size of the crepe was perfect for lunch and my stomach felt miles better after lunch. My husband had the chicken pesto crepe which he enjoyed.  For dessert we had the popular vanilla custard crepe with strawberries. The star of this dish was the crepe itself whose flavor and texture really came through. Many crepes are all about the filling, and this one had a delicious vanilla custard but it wasn't overly sweet. It was almost like a whipped cream.  While we were waiting for our savory crepes, the kitchen sent out a sample of their sage teacake with a fruit compote. The flavor of the sage really came through and was scrumptious. While waiting for dessert, the kitchen sent out samples of their homemade snickerdoodles with little milk tins.  Overall, this place is warm and inviting, The staff makes you feel at home and like you are a welcomed customer. This is rare these days. The only drawback to this restaurant is the bathroom is in the kitchen area so you have to be escorted there.",

    "text": "Yet another place my review is horribly out of date for.  The Crepe Bar is such a fantastic place to go for breakfast ( I should really go for lunch ).  They are small ( but expanding! ) so sometimes it gets a bit crazy there, but it's definitely a friendly neighborhood spot that you just kinda flow with the wait times. They are the farthest thing from a fast food restaurant and the pride they take in what they do is very welcome. Their entire staff are incredibly nice and the few times I have had an issue ( I order the burrito without bacon, I know crazy! ) they have been accommodating and extremely nice. If you ever have an issue do yourself a favor and just say something. They go out of their way to make you happy in my experience. They also bring out cool gastronomic treats for you to try while you wait for your food.  I can safely say most of them I have never even seen before, but are always delicious. I am a creature of habit so I stick with the Breakfast Burrito no Bacon when I go for breakfast. They have changed it up a few times over the years and it just gets better and better. It one of my top things to have for breakfast in the valley. Their coffee is always exceptional., The expresso drinks take a bit of time when they get slammed.  They really take pride in their production, but it is very much worth it if that is your thing. If you are in a bit of a rush the cold brew coffee is excellent and quite a bit faster.  TRY:  - Breakfast Burrito Crepe - Cold Brew - Expresso Drinks",

If you are going to go bigger, please add a cash register (there is still only 1).

Crepe Bar is one of those places that makes you feel like you're almost not cool enough to go there. The coffee is from Portland, the vegetables are local, and there are ingredients on the menu that even a foodie will have to Google. Yes, there's usually a wait. Yes, it's hip. Is that really such a bad thing?   Plus, the recent remodel has seriously upgraded the space and the atmosphere. It has made dining here even better than ever. Not to mention, there are even more non-crepe options like the incredible lemon curd brioche.  This place obviously cares about what they send out on each plate. They take their craft seriously. If you want to eat so fast that you've barely started to digest by the time you leave, this isn't the place for you. If you want to savor a unique food experience, then come here and have one.",

We each ordered the 13 mile vegetarian crepe and I also ordered the butter toast. When I ordered the toast she said they only have marmalade - which to me is fine because it comes with marmalade. It wasn't until I was given the toast that it looked like it was missing the cultured cream. Now I see what was missing! Well...the toast definitely didn't taste as good as it should because it was missing the coolness of the cream.   Prior to receiving the toast we were given a kale bite salad to munch on. This was a lift bite. We were also given fried cauliflower bites.  Looking around the place a customer before received his plate and so we were soon to get ours. After another 15 minutes or so we noticed tray we still have not received our plates. Tables around who came after us received theirs too!! What the hay?! We inquired about our plates and one of the workers told us it was on its way. Another 10 minutes go by and still no plate. My friend went up to the cashier to ask about it again and they said it was on its way. The to-go order of the dessert crepe from my friend came. But still no 13 mile vegetarian crepe!!! Veggies should not be taking this long to cook!!   Almost an hour wait from the time of ordering the server came to our table with 2 to-go boxes! She asked if we would like to eat it here or have it to go. The whole point was to eat it while it's lunch time! Not sure if they confused my friends to go dessert crepe with the rest of the order especially when they brought my toast as a dine in plate. We said we will have a plate. We essentially had to plate the meals ourselves which was kinda weird. The server apologized for the mishap. Unfortunately I ended up only eating half of the crepe and re-boxed it because the whole experience of waiting almost an hour just shut down my appetite.    Also, this place is busy but not busy enough because a line was not forming and it was closer towards closing. A table of 4 behind us (who also came after us) also had 2 orders of the same dang plates! The servers gave away our plates!! No bueno!!   We walked away smelling like we have been the ones cooking in the kitchen all day. I felt bad for my friend because I told her this place was such as awesome place but I don't know if she would agree. What a bummer. Although the food is great the service for this time around definitely lacked. :/ Probably an off day?",

    "text": "My first time here and someone was telling me about a remodel to this place. I was craving some good crepes and followed the Yelp trail to this place. From the outside, it looked like a small shop (it's located in a mini business-park esque area). When you walk in though, you're immediately taken aback by the tasteful decor and atmosphere. It's almost hipster-ish. Felt like a Portland coffee shop.   I thought it would be packed on a Sunday morning, but there were a few free tables luckily! This is one of those spots where you order first and they'll bring your food to you at the table. The menu is very comprehensive and has some very unique and innovative approaches to both sweet and savory crepes. I ordered the Ode to my Sundae and loved it!   Also- get the Moroccan latte. It's a combination of spicy and sweet and I almost bought a second one. Will definitely be back next time I'm around.",

They also brought out a tiny little appetizer of pork rinds before my crepe, that was cool.  I'm very glad we came RIGHT when it opened, because the line was already forming.  My friend and I also ordered the Nutella/banana crepe for dessert.  It was lovely.  It inspired both of us to go buy Nutella and bananas on our way home.  That is a combo that can't be beat!",

Ordered the First Time crepe, Vanilla Bean, and Ode To Sundae and the presentation was very pretty, however, they were just okay.  We ate it since the cost was pricey and didn't want our money to go to waste. Including 3 milks and a coke, our bill was almost $40.00 and the portions small. All of us were quite disappointed and the 4 year old didnt even like the chocolate crepe. To each his own, just not for us.",

    "text": "Excellent breakfast spot in Tempe, AZ. The menu is small, but everything is amazing. Good mix of sweet and savory options, and the prices are reasonable ($9-$11 for a crepe).  A word of warning - if you are looking for a \"typical\" place for breakfast (eggs, bacon, and toast), then this is not the place for you. The flavors are very unique and primarily consist of crepes. My favorite item on the menu is the Pork Chorizo burrito (eggs, black beans, jack, ancho salsa, avocado, cotija ), but the Papa K (Hassayampa ham, eggs, chili jack, roasted mushroom), Grand Prix (pork belly, espresso maple, chili aioli, egg up), and Buckwheat & Honey (lemon curd, Sonoran blossom honey, AZ pecans) are all incredible. Happy Eating!!",

    "text": "\"I want it, oh, I want it Oh, I want it for my own I've got to know I've got to know What is this place that I have found?  What's this?\" - J. Skellington  The lunch bunch had wanted to enjoy Crepe Bar for many months, but had been previously scared away by reports of insane wait times and limited seating (sohwee Janee P).  Realizing that they took reservations, I set aside a table for 6 (really 8) about two weeks prior.  And boy, am I glad I did.  Walking in with Ann R, I didn't see an available table in the place... which is when I noticed J-WoW and Linh were occupying the table of highest honors... the reserved hi-top.  Realizing that our party of 4 was not getting any larger, we shifted to one side of the table to free up four contiguous chairs, because we're thoughtful and stuff.  Our Sep outing found us at Salut Kitchen Bar with the greatest waitress of all time: Keary.  I found her male counterpart: Cody.  This dude embodied the essence of Crepe Bar, fun, witty, timely, and able to turn down a bribe.  I'll be back with more cash...  Being our first time, the table took a while to lock in on palatable entrees, and Cody didn't rush, even though the place was packed.  Even better, since we were at a reserved table, we didn't have to order at the counter.  Dining in a group really is the only way to go.  I paid for one savory crepe, yet was a partaker in four amazing crepe combinations.  I couldn't pick a favorite, they were all so good!  And Cody had the sensibility to hold off on the sweet crepes until our party had completed round 1.  But what's this?  We were being treated to a sampling of paper thin cut radishes on cultured butter.  Hey, it could have been served with ignorant margarine, and I wouldn't have known the difference, but it was nice to feel so froufrou... because, you know.. I'm in the fast lane from LA to Tokyo.  Okay  Upon arrival, I knew J's dessert was going to take the cake.  That crepe was bananas, B.A.N.A.N.A.S.  That crepe was also nutella, N.U.T.E.L.L.A!  One more round of free resplendent Rollos and we were ready for our PhotoOp... which Cody and team made happen.  Overall, it was a FABULOUS lunch.  I'll award the Crepe Bar an: A + + + + + + + + + + !  And I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day",

I'm from Belgium and know how a good crepe taste. The location is nice, remind me of Europe for sure. The paintings exhibition looks cool but beside the decor, there was not too much positive things. The tea was great. Herbal tea, Le hameau and coffee tasted good. The latte looked delicious but did not try it. I feel I wasted my money:-(",

The crepes are very good, although I think the crepes could be a little lighter, texture-wise. Nevertheless, the flavors and portions are good without making u feel heavy afterwards. We started off with the butter toast which is served slightly charred but still soft in the middle. The cultured cream and sea salt was a tasty combination on top. I ordered the breakfast burrito crepe which was very filling and tasted very much like a traditional breakfast sandwich/burrito. I'm not sure it was worth it to add the \"fries\" to the crepe because the fries turned out to be tiny breakfast potatoes scattered on the plate which I didn't really have enough of to enjoy. I also ordered the vanilla custard crepe which was filled with yummy custard, but the custard was light and reminded me more of a very velvety whipped cream or yogurt even. It wasn't overly sweet or dense and was the perfect compliment to our entrees.   I also really enjoyed the attentive and friendly service from the employees. Throughout our meal, we were surprised with a few samples of their yummy desserts. Speaking of desserts, their dessert case looked very tempting (cookies, brownies, sweet buns etc.) and had we not indulged in a sweet crepe, I definitely would have ordered one of the pastries on display. Overall, our experience was divine and I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!",

Same for the staff who are friendly and helpful and seem to like being there and making sure you like being there too.  That said, the baked goods only rate 3-STARS, and were dry and underwhelming, despite their impressive appearance. At the table, I bit into my cookie with disappointment and remarked, \"This is like having the biggest box under the Christmas tree, only to find it full of socks.\"   The real disappointment was the coffee, which is surprising because a bunch of college age kids in a crepe bar serving breakfast should serve a mean cuppa joe. This was not it. 1-STAR on the coffee.  But please remember, the crepes very easily get 5-STARS and after all, the place is called \"CREPE BAR\", so that's what you're definitely going to go there to eat. And probably go back again to eat. And again. And again.",

The crepe batter was great. I particularly like it better than Cupz n Crepes . It's well seasoned and the texture was the right amount of sponginess. I got a a ham and cheese with spinach crepe. (The creative menu name escapes me.) It was okay. My cousin got the Chicken pesto which was stellar!!! I'll come back for that one. :) And to make a good meal even better, you can't go wrong with the First Timer, which we shared.

    "text": "The weirdest/worst place I have ever been.   I had decided to come here one day with a close friend to grab lunch before work. we were extremely hungry and had heard good things so decided to give it a try.   First of all, it has the most AWFUL smell to to store. Once I walked in I lost my appetite because that smell was horrific. then they handed us a menu and I had explained I had never been there before. the menu was very small and extremely confusing. she had us sit down just to get back up again and give our order up into the front, and sit back down AGAIN.  when we had first came up to the line the man behind the counter yelled at us saying we went to the wrong line. it was very rude. the girl who took our order has multiple facial piercings, which I didn't like because it they were trying to represent themselves as a classy restaurant.   i got the \"first time\" crepe which was Nutella and banana and my friend got a creame strawberry crepe. it cost about $7 each which was outrageous compared to the other crepe places we have tried.   we couldn't even stand the smell so we chose to sit outside in the 90 degree weather. although no one was really there (mind you it was a lunch time so that was odd), our food took a while. while sitting in the heat outside the facial piercings girl brought us 3 sweet potato chips \"on the house\". it was very embarrassing that they thought that was a good appetizer and the chips weren't good at all. finally we got our food after 15 minutes.   IT WAS HORRIBLE. there were 3 mini crepes, and I mean very mini. not worth $7. it was nothing special at all. my friend and I were still very hungry afterward and ended up walking to the croissant restaurant next door and spent the rest of our time there. I will never be going back to the crepe bar.",

When I walked in, one of the employees greeted me with a menu and helped direct us accordingly. One would order in the front and once you put in your order, you're given a number to place on the table at which you choose to sit. I was here with my family so we ordered a combination of sweet crepes and savory crepes. The Burrito Chorizo crepe had a very good, almost curry flavor to it. The Maple Butter crepe was perfect level of sweetness. It was not overpowering, and I didn't feel like dying from a sugar rush. Both crepes had a nice ratio of crepe to crepe filling. I was extremely impressed by the crepes. They do also offer non-crepe items for those who are not crepe fans. Service here is mediocre. They were helpful enough and quick! They did a good job keeping the place clean.",

They're simply delicious, bursting with flavor, and perfectly prepared. I had the grilled chicken with onions, cheddar, arugula, and an herb sauce that complimented everything perfectly. Finished with a dash of pesto and a touch of sea salt, you really couldn't ask for more.  I had to razz Jeff a bit about the lack of duck-fat frites, but he told me that was owing to the lack of a hood in their kitchen and that he was hoping to experiment a bit with his oven.  Either way, the price is right, the crepes are absolutely BRILLIANT, and Jeff & co. are just lovely people to visit.  Do yourself a favor and have a lovely crepe lunch or dessert. They're really stick-with-you fantastic.",

    "text": "This place is sort of a victim of its own popularity. It's hard to find a seat, and when you do, you're pretty well packed in. Sometimes, like this morning, it might take 40 minutes to get your food. So, why the five star review?  Here's the thing: I don't care about the wait or the cramped quarters, because the food is so good. Every time we go, my wife and I comment that we've just had the best breakfast of our lives, and then, the next time we go, we say the same thing.  The Grand Prix is my favorite: a coffee crepe covered with a smoky maple syrup sauce. Laced with thick cubes of bacon and perfectly caramelized pork belly. It's also topped with an over-easy egg - great for anyone who can't decide between sweet and savory. Then there's my wife's favorite: the pick-me-up - a coffee crepe with Nutella and chocolate dusting. The duck Cuban is no slouch either.   My kids love it, my vegetarian wife loves it, and the rapacious carnivore in me loves it. We always leave happy and full, even if it took us a long time to get there.",

    "text": "I never really understood what the big deal was with crepes, but the Crepe Bar made a believer out of me.   The menu is basic, but that simplicity also makes it classic. There are three sweet crepes - nutella and bananas, cream and berries, and a house special of creme brulee. The savory crepes include a burrito and a few others (sorry, can't remember!). Husband and I ordered two berry crepes and a vanilla latte. As we waited for our food, we watched the burrito go by and decided we'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split. My latte arrived in a black ceramic cup with a foam heart on top, delivered by a smiling employee. First sip - heavenly. (One of the better lattes I've had recently and I'm a coffee snob.) Quickly our crepes followed, looking beautiful on pristine, white plates. There were strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries dancing over sweet cream with a singular crepe rolled up and sliced into rolls - might have looked skimpy, but definitely filling. Husband requested caramel be drizzled over his, adding a sweeter taste to his crepe. Crepe was light and airy, no crispy edges and just sweet enough. The cream and berries were definitely fresh.  The location is a bit hard to find and for us the drive takes 30 minutes with no traffic. Committing to that kind of drive time just to get some breakfast food, it's gotta be good, right? Damn straight. The inside is a bit sparse, I don't remember any wall art, but there are plenty of tables and chairs. On the steel counter top, instead of a regular cash register, they use an iPad - which gives them cool techie cred. You can also see the chef at work, which is nice to see where the food comes from.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to take your date, relatives, friends, maybe even strangers - just gather them all up and prepare for deliciousness.",

Well, I know one thing, I'm a huge fan of Chef Jeff Krauss and Crepe Bar's former incarnation, \"Truckin Good Food\" and have high hopes for the success of his newest venture.  The space is chill and if the experience at the friends and family pre-opening this weekend is any indication of the quality of the food and service, i'm betting they will be hugely successful.  My first bites included a buckwheat blini with candied almond mousse and strawberry basil, refreshing, light and tasty.  A yogurt parfait with lemon cream, dressed berries, spelt & pistachio fragments and my choice for \"favorite of the day\" a \"breakfast burrito\" in the form of a smoked chili crepe with bacon egg & jack topped with avocado salsa.   All were worthy of note and I'll be back with a full write-up and pictures in the next few days after i've had an opportunity to have full portions of the menu items.",

But that can be easily overlooked.   After you place your order and sit down they bring you something small to snack on. One time it was granola, the next time it was small scones. The lunch crepe I ordered came with a small salad. The first time we ordered dessert we had the banana and nutella. A good option an stand-by. The second time we ordered the lemon. WOW!

I don't live in Arizona, but whenever I visit, it is a requirement that I eat here. It's that good.   The food: Where to begin?  The crepes are presented wonderfully, with a rim of Parmesan at the circumference, and neatly folded. Their taste and texture are sublime.  The fillings are fairly evenly distributed within, so you always get a little bit of everything with each bite (which really pleases those of us who suffer from OCD). The mushroom ragout is seasoned and caramelized to perfection! I could eat it alone and leave delighted and satisfied!  My children are picky to the point of malnourishment, but they scarfed down the amazing banana-Nutella crepe and the equally dazzling vanilla-strawberry-chocolate crepes voraciously. This saddened me somewhat, because I wanted to eat a larger portion of their crepes. :(      The service: No one is dressed up here, but no one is a snob either. Progression through the line to order is slow, but when it's your turn, the always-friendly staff never make you feel rushed, and they are well-acquainted with the menu items, which is great, since this is not mundane wafflehouse fare.  On weekends, it is very busy, and seating can be scarce. Don't come if you're in a hurry, or you will be unhappy.  Once you are seated, you often get a complimentary bowl of their homemade granola, which is outstanding (and truthfully, I normally hate granola).",

The main thing for the updated review is that I tried the Grand Prix and I was so disappointed. I've been meaning to try it for a while and it's been hard for me to get there early (it's served 7a to 11a) mainly because I am incredibly lazy. The meat was tough and dry. There were like, two or three pieces. They're suppose to be the star but they acted as a garnish (figures), as separated from the plate as they are. I did enjoy the coffee flavor of the crepes.

I loved the textures and flavors of all the elements, personally, I truly enjoyed the fondue.  It was delicious and I can't wait to come back to try some more, especially the sweet ones.  With choices like maple butter and pick me up, how can you resist?!  (The only reason I did was because I've indulged a little too much this birthday week already).  The service was wonderful and very attentive.  I'll be back Crepe Bar and you best have some Grand Prix and a Pick Me Up available.",

    "text": "My order was completely wrong. I have no idea how I order a build your own breakfast crepe, list all of the items I want in my breakfast and end up with the breakfast burrito? The waitress was writing for a while when I ordered and I thought she just wasn't short-hand writing my order which is unusual.. I have no idea what she was writing because when my order came out wrong she showed me the order she had written down (like that solved anything) and all that was written was 'burro'. I had to ask 'so when I said I would like to build my crepe and listed off mushrooms, spinach, ham and onions you heard burrito?' (which obviously has none of those ingredients) her response was 'well, that's what everyone orders'. Are you kidding me????   Anyway, I ate the burrito because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for my food. it was actually really good I can see why other people order it but I was really craving mushrooms.  #dayruiner",

    "text": "My amazingly \"in the know\" girlfriend recommended we try Crepe Bar for breakfast and was sold the moment she said \"crepe.\" They did not disappoint!   I ordered the savory breakfast burrito filled with fluffy scrambled eggs, bacon, avocado salsa, jack cheese all tucked inside a chipotle crepe. The crepe was soft, with a spongy texture and with that chipotle flavor, it really made for an interesting twist on the usual breakfast burrito so prevalent in Phoenix.  Keep in mind you will need a fork and knife to eat it, but the quality of ingredients and combo of favors made it a solid option. I also ordered a hot mocha from the counter and it was fantastic.   We arrived around 9:30am and it was already pretty busy, as other reviews say it can be a bit of a wait, so plan accorded. But it is definitely worth if!",

The bar is trendy and well laid out with a mix of tables and high-top seating.  The menu is well sized and simple in the number of offerings.  Don't be fooled, there is sea of complexity and culinary genuis under the surface in each dish.    The staff is very friendly and well versed in what they serve.  Upon ordering our crepes (two savory, and one sweet) as well as a few unique beverages to wash them down with, we were greeted (unexpectedly) with a several courses of small appetizers.  I'm not going to do any of them (or the owners) any injustice by attempting to incorrectly classify them or butcher their names.  I will simply say that each was masterfully prepared and presented.  The component ingredients of each seemed to be hand selected to bring something to unique to the composite dish.  All were very well executed.  The crepes themselves?  Spectacular.  I'm a sucker for anything that contains cheese and avocado, but the proportions have to be right as to not distract from the core ingredients of the dish.  The turkey crepe with chorizo, smoked gouda, and avocado was prefectly balanced and rediculously good.  The duck crepe toped with what appeared to be roast beef and a whole-seed mustard sauce was also perfectly done.  I never though much of crepes before, and they were certainly never on my list of culinary cravings.   My how that has changed.   Well done guys, well done.",

It was different and surprisingly yum. Not super filling. Perfect for my appetite, but left everyone else still hungry. Here was our order: duck Cuban crepe (duck cuban Hassayampa ham, smoke serrano soubise, mustard seed chutney 8.75), papa k (Hassayampa ham, pepperjack, mushroom ragout 7.00), vanilla bean custard crepe (marinated strawberries 5.75 + salted caramel .50 + chocolate fudge .50), rose marshmallow crepe (chocolate hazelnut, rose gel, salted lakrids 8.00 - tasted a bit like soap; the rose, I imagine), and toast egg up (allowed us to substitute cheese for avocado since it was for a kid 6.00). A bit on the pricier side, but you're paying for the inventive combinations and presentation. I really enjoyed the flavor pairings of the savory crepes and the custard crepe, the marshmallow, not so much. We also got complimentary house-made granola while we waited for our order. I really loved the granola, though sweet and not really crunchy. Not super family friendly seating available, mostly tables for 2-4 and bar tops, but excellent service and attitudes. It's a walk-up, so no tips necessary. Good times.",

    "text": "LOVE Crepe Bar!   So excited that this place recently opened in my old Tempe stomping grounds - if only it had existed while I attended high school nearby :)   Crepe Bar offers both savory and sweet crepes and both aspects of the menu are enticing.   On the savory menu, I've had both the Chicken Pesto and Papa K, which were delicious.  The Chicken Pesto has more muted flavors, but is crazy satisfying. The cheddar cheese is delightfully crispy at the edges of the crepe (my favorite part!)   The mushroom ragout that is part of the Papa K has amazing flavor that I can't get out of my head - highly recommend!   I've had the Vanilla Bean Custard with Strawberries for dessert multiple times - I find that the addition of Valhrona chocolate is absolutely integral to a particularly delicious sweet ending to your meal at Crepe Bar.   Something that I really enjoy is their presentation - the plates are absolutely beautiful. Considering that the prices are about $8ish a crepe, that is impressive and lends to the feeling of a very upscale experience, even in such a fun, casual setting.   The service at the restaurant is wonderful - the employees are friendly, solicitous, and accommodating. Keep in mind though, it IS a counter-service restaurant, where you place your order at the cash register and your food is delivered to you. When you order multiple courses, they try to space it out, but on both of my visits our dessert arrived prior to our entrees being completely finished. Also, the food typically takes awhile to arrive initially (even when the restaurant isn't uber busy)   The drink selection is a bit odd... coffee is obviously their deal and they appear to be very committed to the art of coffee, which is commendable. I will say that the non-coffee offerings suffer a bit ... there aren't any fountain drink options, but they do have a few bottled sodas available in a cooler beside the register (the \"microbrew\" rootbeer they offer is very good - tastes just a little herbal and is delicious) This detracts from the experience somewhat because the restaurant is very warm - and the alternative to sitting inside the somewhat stuffy dining room is to sit outdoors, which is also often very warm. The drinks from the case are coolish, at best, which means that, combined with the hot temperatures, there isn't a chance for a particularly refreshing, cold drink (especially after waiting awhile for your meal) Sooo... that's a little disappointing.   Lastly, they don't allow modifications. At all. After working with Chefs for a living, and eating at many, many restaurants where I've learned that it is in my interest to trust the professionals, I am absolutely a proponent of \"Chef knows best\". I also know that with a small kitchen and labor intensive dishes, special requests and changes can be very challenging. So I get it - I get why you would try to be up front and strongly discourage modifications. BUT I think that sticking to that policy without exception comes across as pretty customer unfriendly... especially when it is something basic, like instead of chocolate on the side, requesting nutella (an ingredient that is offered with another crepe)? But again, I do get it...  Anyway, Crepe Bar is great! Such a wonderful addition and I can't recommend it enough - very unique, well executed and just so much fun.",

    "text": "IMPORTANT NOTE  First of all, I stand by my original review of Crepe Bar, which I included below, and I even think Crepe Bar just keeps getting better and better!  UPDATE  A lot has changed since my first visit to Crepe Bar!  Most notably, the new renovations, which are amazing!  I've come so many times since I first found Crepe Bar on Yelp in 2015.  I love trying their daily menu, as well as their mainstays.  I usually get the daily special AND the vanilla bean with strawberries.  I know, I know, I'm a glutton, but I prefer to use my extra calories here.  Since my last visit, I've tried the Breakfast Burrito, the Duck Cuban (hassayampa ham, smoked Serrano soubise, and mustard seed chutney), Grand Prix Crepe (Coffee Crepe, pork belly, maple glazed pork jowl, egg up, espresso syrup), and countless of their counter treats too!  Their free Yelp check-in coffee is so strong and delicious!   The service is usually 100%, and it's a FANTASTIC place to hangout and get free coffee refills!  CONCLUSION  Although Crepe Bar is in an unappealing strip mall in Tempe, Arizona, the food is WORTH THE TRIP!  5/5 RECOMMEND   *************************************************** **************ORIGINAL REVIEW************  I recently started really getting into Yelp and I kept seeing the people I follow rave about the Crepe Bar in Tempe.  I don't even remember how many reviews I actually saw, but it seemed like everyone had been there except me.   Maybe I just had crepes on the brain.  Anyway, I went to try the Crepe Bar and it was closed. I guess they're closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.   I went back a few days later and wasn't even sure I was in the right place.   I had seen so many pictures from Yelp, I was expecting something with a bit more \"wow factor.\" The Crepe Bar, however, is in the middle of a strip mall on the North West corner of Rural and Elliot.  The inside was super busy and reminiscent of a hip European cafe.   It was a little confusing at first how to order, but obvious once you figure out their system.  At the counter, they have amazing homemade daily treats on display.  When I checked in on Yelp, I immediately won a free tea or drip coffee, which was pretty cool.   I ordered one of the meat crepes and one of the dessert crepes each visit.   The first time I had the breakfast burrito crepe and the vanilla bean with marinated strawberries (total under $15).  The second time, I had the Papa K and maple butter with bananas brulee (total under $20). (see pics)  The flavors of the mixtures were unbelievable.   And the quality of the crepes is outstanding:  Light and flavorful.  CONCLUSION   The environment is small and unassuming, but clean and a super cool place to have an amazing breakfast and hangout.  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Hours: Wed - Sat 7am - 2pm Sun 9am - 2pm Mon/Tues CLOSED  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcrepe-bar.com&s=c453f47697917e8a3f133d8c2c6347dad03f9da108b52f94780446903a531218\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">crepe-bar.com</a>",

The only issue I've noticed is some inconsistencies with what the menu says and what ends up on the plate,  specifically with salads on the side.  My friend had gotten a savory crepe that comes with a side salad and never received it. When she inquired she was told the greens were on top of the crepe (it was just cilantro)",

Plus their coffee (Heart coffee roasters from Portland) is really solid.   Food: 5.0 Wow. I'm impressed. I had the Grand Prix--a pork belly crepe with chipotle aioli, espresso-maple syrup, and a fried egg. Absolutely fantastic--a delightful balance of bright sweetness from the maple-chipotle and toasty grounding from the espresso and seared pork belly. Beautiful plating. We also tried the maple butter and the one with curried vegetables--both very tasty. But that pork belly...absolutely the star of the show.   Coffee: 4.5 It's very difficult to successfully put forth such high quality food and coffee...but I was impressed by their baristaship. Despite not being a fully-dedicated coffee staff, they did justice to Heart coffee's magnificent beans and really just made great coffee. Just shy of a top tier coffee shop--which if you ask me, is really impressive given their obvious dedication to food.   Ambiance: 4.5 Fun, open area. Only wish it wasn't so busy...although given that food, I can't say I'm surprised.",

    "text": "Good mix of sweet and savory creeps here.  Before I took my wife here, she didn't even know crepes were a thing.  Now we come here about once a month!  I tend to go for the more savory offerings, such as the Jamaican jerk or the Chipotle burrito.  Last time I went with the chipotle burrito was not disappointed.  My wife tends to play it more safe with the nutella & banana crepes.    The set-up is a bit odd.  You wait in a line that runs out the front door while trying to wait for a table.  What ends up happening is people who are waiting in line will send someone to reserve the table once a table opens up.  This is frustrating to the people who just got their food and are standing around looking at each other wondering where to eat.  Also, there is a barista who makes flavorful lattees such as sea salt caramel, vanilla, and honey.  In my experience, the drinks sounds good on paper but all tend to taste similar.    I recommend coming here as soon as they open up so you are not left doing battle with people to get a table to sit.  Also, the lattes are worth trying out, one should be enough for you and your significant other.  Lastly, if you and your wife are having a tough time deciding what to get, get one savory and one sweet and split them.",

I became a fan instantaneously!  My mom on the other hand is such a picky eater & I was even surprised she LOVED the food! She had their fresh fried pork-skins (chicharron) & the second time crepes and she loved them! The chicharron was so fresh & when the lady dropped it off at our table you can just smell how delicious they were! I ordered the second time crepes also, as well as their side of potatoes & everything was splendid! Their potatoes were tossed in a delicious savory sauce that complimented them very well!  We had such a great time, that we will definitely be back.  They open at 9am & we got there around 9:08am and the line was already to the door & it was very packed. I'd say get there as early as possible because they serve great food & the lines don't lie! Lol Thanks Crepe Bar for the delicious breakfast this morning!",

I also got the pesto chicken and a \"first time\" crepe (Nutella and banana brulee).  The wait was a little longer, but one of the servers brought out a bacon scone for me to snack on. Not a big fan of bacon in scones, but they get points for noticing that I had been waiting. It's that attention to detail that makes me a loyal customer.   The pesto chicken was awesome!  I think I prefer my crepes sweet though so next time I will stick with a dessert crepe, but it was delicious.  The \"first time\" was incredible!  I had the server box up it up after a few bites. Otherwise I would have eaten the whole thing and been ill. :-)  Before I left, one of the servers let me know that he would be brining out something to try if I had time to stick around.  He brought out a mini mascarpone cheesecake-like thing with whipped cream and granola on it.  Wow!  Rich and delicious.  Apparently they serve those only for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights.  Go there with an appetite!  It was excellent!",

And they always have a good seasonal veggie crepe that is mind blowing. I wish there was more seating, but if you come early (or later) you usually don't have an issue. This place.... It's like the binkleys of crepes. So many different little nibbles being passed around! I love.... Lovvvvvve their granola.   Also. They bring around a delicious little rose marshmallow sometimes, it's amazing. Don't ever turn it down, no matter how full you are.",

They have both savory and sweat crepes and all are delicious.  The sauces are complex and unique on their own, the flavors blended perfectly and every bite a delight.  They also have farm to table relationships with local growers and bakers which yields great results.  With that why only 4 stars? Mainly because they are a victim of their success.  This is a order at the counter then take a seat place and on weekends the line can be almost out the door.  They recently expanded their seating space but the kitchen struggles to keep up with the demand.  Thankfully, they don't compromise on quality but the wait can be a bit long (especially when you know what is coming).  I recommend you stop in for breakfast or lunch on a weekday (Wed - Fri, they are closed Monday and Tuesday) and get the five star experience.",

So we decided to go to Crepe bar.  Crepe bar is located in a strip mall kinda place and as we entered I did not expect too much from this place. Seating was open, so we ordered the basil chicken crepe and the banana Nutella crepe.   While waiting for our order to arrive, we were served with a croissant looking amazingly delicious bread!! It was complimentary and I could not believe how delicious a fried croissant could taste!!!! We were also served with a bowl of multigrain oatmeal kinda cereal which was excellent as well!! These two tiny appetizers that they served us were amazing and I started expecting more from our orders!!  When our order arrived, I had the best chicken basil crepe EVER!!! This was by far the best savory crepe I have ever had. I love basil and I loved how nice and juicy the chicken was. It was perfect!!   The banana Nutella crepe was pretty awesome too!! What on earth could go wrong with warm Nutella and caramelized bananas!!!  I had a great experience at this place and I am sure to visit this place again in the future. I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place for crepes!! The service is awesome and their food is the best!!",

    "text": "I have a bit of a \"crepe\" issue.  There is just something about a meal that could technically be breakfast but it tastes like a dessert!   The problem is if you want crepes then your options are IHOP, Village inn, or you have to drive to a far off place  and it's like a trip to never-never land..... And the entire way your thinking do I really want a crepe this bad??? Does this mean I have a problem? My subconscious is telling me that if crepes were illegal then I would have a street corner dealer on speed dial.   First, the crepeier is a modern little place full of hipsters and long haired hippies or in today's lingo the \"bohemian\" look. If you want to see man-buns this is the place.   Well, my very late 30s soccer mom hopped up on caffeine and the thrill of being childless for 25.6 minutes was not a good blend for the \"emo cafeteria\" but I played it cool........I drove 20 mins for strawberries wrapped in a thin pancake then smothered with whip cream and some type of magical sauce.   Well things started to go down hill fast.   Have you ever seen the soup nazi Seinfeld episode? Well.... I just strolled my way into the crepe nazi and my blood sugar was moving into dangerous levels and I had started to sweat.   I'm sure it's because on some primal level my body sensed that \"crepes\" were close by.   Here is the deal. I didn't want to eat this heavenly snack surrounded by people who are wounded with the you don't \"get\" me face and I had to pick up 3 hyper children in exactly 40 minutes so these strawberry delights were coming with me and I had limited time.   I rarely get to eat out and rarely at restaurants with \"rules.\" This joint is in a semi-run down 1982 shopping center. So I wasn't expecting rules like you get at Flemings or Capital Grille!  First, you can only get about 1/2 the menu to go because it has to be plated/presented in a special way.   The strawberry crepes happen to fall under an extremely strict \"no take out\" policy.   As, this was being explained, I dug for more detail on this no exceptions policy.   The Hipster Explained there is a magical way that they smear sauce on the plate however this magic cannot take place in a to-go box. Then she turned away in a aloof depressed silence and I'm pretty sure she was either extremely offended or practicing for a Shakespearean play.   Suddenly I felt like Queen Leer had just run over my cat.  I began questioning about alternatives to my first choice that would not \"break\" the take out code.   After about 5 minutes, I had the options of beets and of something else that sounded unappetizing.   I was ready to leave empty handed when I decided to run a Hail Mary and order the strawberries with an announcement of staying to eat. Wink wink....  20 minutes later in complete Y generation glory ( the place was empty and well they had important things to do like solving all the worlds problems by sending out good vibes to the universe) I finally got my meal.   I have made crepes myself and it takes less time to make a crepe then to mix up some pancake mix and flip a flap jack.   I grab a to-go box and scoop the yummy tart in faster then my kids can brush their teeth.   Then I try to avoid eye contact as I beam for the door.  I dodge the stares of disgust only to get a full wave goodbye and a silent glare from who I would guess to be the hall monitor of crepe rules.   They were good.... Not amazing but good! I might just make them at home next time but if your I the area then try it out but only if your staying to eat!",

I finally stopped by there today, and my veggie crepe *looked* delicious, but the taste wasn't there.  Sadly, the best part about my veggie crepe was the parmesan on top that was baked into a crisp cracker. Without that crunch and salt, the crepe would have been an utter disappointment.  What really bummed me out about the crepe were the choice of veggies for the filling: zucchini and yellow squash. Really?! So lame and cheap! I expected Crepe Bar to focus on seasonal produce. I know they use produce from our neighborhood farm, so why do they use these ubiquitous summer veggies in a vegetarian crepe? There could be so many better alternatives this time of year. Root vegetables, winter greens, or something from the cruciferous family.  I was happy with my cappuccino, It had a very pretty leaf on top, and the taste was great. It reminded me of Cafe Grumpy in New York which is a very good thing.  I'll come back for another try at their savory crepes in hope that Crepe Bar can redeem themselves.",

    "text": "Came here two days in a row!  Yesterday, I met a GF for brunch.  It was her first time.  She noticed that the restaurant ordering and design exuded a European flair-- order at the counter, and self-serve napkins, cups, and sugar cubes.  (She didn't notice this at first, but staff didn't mind fetching the sugar cubes for her.)  She doesn't drink coffee and wanted English breakfast tea, so I let her use my free Maya tea with Yelp check-in.  She ordered the Papa K, while I went with a Mocha, made with 55% Valrhona chocolate and rose essence, and maple butter crepe (no surprise there). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=KPfw5w57yJTw3cudbjIwdw#KPfw5w57yJTw3cudbjIwdw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a>  When Leah (one of the staff members) delivered my mocha, GF immediately ordered one for herself.  While we both thought the rose essence was a bit too strong, I finished mine and she abandoned hers (and ended up asking for just black coffee, instead).  Whether it was the additional food aromas/flavors mixing in with the rose essence, or just the mocha-rose combo mellowing over time, I was able to appreciate the beverage to the last drop.  GF tried another sip and said, \"No.  Still too strong.\"  Her Papa K entree looked and sounded terrific!  I could hear the crunch of the top and edges as she sliced through the crepe with her knife.  She ate every bite of it! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=rQ0RK-WZDIeuPbzmHde01Q#rQ0RK-WZDIeuPbzmHde01Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a>  Her crepe also came with a side salad, dressed with a simple citrus vinaigrette.  I also ordered a choux, made with the same batter as a cream puff/profiterole, accompanied by date butter, and a brioche du jour, which came with date butter and macerated strawberries. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=bc_cBNSEyYy6jo5orkSlNA#bc_cBNSEyYy6jo5orkSlNA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a>  I didn't care for the choux's soft textures, but I very much enjoyed the date butter!  I also loved the brioche.  So much so, that I ordered it again this morning...  Tastings for the day were sweet potato chips with salt, house-made yogurt with crushed hazelnuts and buckwheat streusel, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=CunzDO19CazGPrqPFfXJqw#CunzDO19CazGPrqPFfXJqw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a> and house-made rollos. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=-YruYpBaXfdu_7LxWdUcmQ#-YruYpBaXfdu_7LxWdUcmQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a>  I almost didn't have my share of the rollos, as I was quite full from brunch, but GF made me eat it!  She said it was fantastic and that I had to try it.  Oh-kay!  :)  For this morning's adventure, two GFs and I met and ordered two breakfast burros, minus the guac <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=s8sQ2SOL3L_DN3VnaMr_pg#s8sQ2SOL3L_DN3VnaMr_pg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a> and a vanilla bean crepe with strawberries.  Oh, why did I not take a photo of the sweet crepe??  I went with a pretty and tasty cup o' cappuccino <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=JT-wA12bXITpB92_hX6xeg#JT-wA12bXITpB92_hX6xeg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a>, while the two had Maya lemon drop tea (with lemongrass).  I was able to tell one GF to take advantage of the free tea at Yelp check-in by downloading the app, but forgot to let the other one know, as she ran late and I had no time to tell her.  They both LOVED the tea!  So much so, I'll have to give it a try on my next visit.  I again ordered the brioche du jour, which hadn't changed from the day before.  This time, we all enjoyed it (GFs ooh'ed and ahh'ed!), while GF yesterday must've tried a bite of the toast sans date butter.  She only tasted sour berries, and apparently, she doesn't do sour.  Tastings for the day were sweet potato chips with date butter on the bottom, house-made yogurt and local Agritopia radishes, with fresh-ground black pepper and salt, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=FmFSjGiFVaIpuLi8rEGroA#FmFSjGiFVaIpuLi8rEGroA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a> and two mini-flutes of rose hot cocoa (this time the rose/cocoa ratio was perfect!).  They originally came with popcorn bits, but Leah graciously made another one for me without them! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?start=400&select=8wF7p4-0433ecIEXx6nAMw#8wF7p4-0433ecIEXx6nAMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a>  Thank you so much!  One friend left too early (had to go to work), while the other enjoyed all of the tastings.  She said it was one of the best meals she's had lately!  Kudos to Jeff K. and CB's staff!  We'll be back!",

    "text": "\"You don't win friends with salad.\"   Homer Simpson  I'm not sure how the quote fits but I've been wanting to use it for a while.  Anywho!  Crepes.  Those delicious thinly cooked pancakes with yummy stuff packed into them.  Who doesn't love a good crepe?    So the Lunch Bunch had a long overdue brunch and we've all been dying to try the Crepe Bar for quite some time.  We had a reservation at 11:30am for a party of six.  Two party poopers didn't show but that didn't stop us from having a straight up feast-party.  We all had checked-in and used the handy Yelp check-in offer for some Maya Tea.  After a quick \"Cheers\" or \"Okole maluna\" as twinsie Nadine C. of Honolulu has taught us, we gave our incredibly charismatic and knowledgeable waiter Cody the most difficult 5-minutes of his life.  Seriously, how can four people have such difficulties when ordering?  For savory crepes, we had ordered an Andouille Sausage, Maple Butter with Pork Jowl, Basil Chicken, and the Grand Prix with Duck Egg [thanks for letting me order this even though it was past 11am].  For sweet crepes, we had two Vanilla Bean Custards, a Lemon Drop, and a First Time.  We also got to try a Radish dish from Joe's at Agritopia Farm with cultured butter, smoked salt, and lime; homemade Rolos with vanilla bean custard, caramel, and a banana chip crumble; and some sinfully decadent, salted, dark chocolate with a creamy caramel sauce.    Although we all ended up sharing and picking off each others plates, my dishes were the Grand Prix with Duck Egg and the First Time, all of which were recommended by Cody.  Everybody had some pretty amazing dishes but I felt like I had the best dishes of the day.  The Grand Prix was like something out of Iron Chef Michael Symon's twisted head.  It  was a coffee crepe with giant pieces of juicy pork belly, maple-glazed pork jowl, and an upgraded sunny-side-up duck egg.  It was sooo incredibly rich and so fattening but absolutely delicious.  The pork belly was just literally melting under my fork.  I'm so glad there were three companions I can pawn off my pork belly to because oh lawdy!  Where's my siSTAR Aline N., Marc M., and his cat Flash  to share this with?  I seriously hope a cardiologist doesn't need to be called in because whoa!  Of course I ended up being thirsty all day since it was rich and salty goodness but it was well worth it.  I think I'll have salad until Thanksgiving now.  As for the First Time, that Nutella and banana brulee man...  Enough said.  All in all, I had definitely one of the best damn lunches in a long while and I definitely will be stopping by again.  I promise I won't throw my menu and stuff this time.  The wait time for your food to come out can be a tad of a wait but it's only because it's so busy and because their food is so damn good!  The wait is easily bearable when you have the best group of friends ever.  Feeling so lucky today!",

All I wanted was a Nutella crepe with strawberries. No extra anything. This is largely in part for my food allergies, but also I just wanted a classic Parisian crepe. I was rudely told I could not change anything on the menu. If that's how it is, fine, but the attitude after standing in line for so long I was completely uncalled for. I tried doing a Nutella crepe with a side of strawberries, No. I offered to pay whatever else they wanted to get the side, no. In the end I had to purchase 2 $6 crepes, to create a crepe myself. Total ingredients -was a crepe, Nutella, and strawberries.  Paying the extra was not my main issue. Standing in line for that amount of time, letting them know about my allergy, and the complete incapacity to help or make suggestions. The only way for me to outsmart situation was to purchase the two  completely different crapes, subtracting everything besides the one ingredient. The only reason I did that, but because of the amount of time already wasted. I am someone who would eat a crepe every day, or at least a couple times a week. Apparently a simple change to something is not worth the money they could have made.",

Seriously?  You've been open an hour, and you're out?  Not good planning on the part of the kitchen.  The breakfast burrito was good with the exception of the white bits of \"powdered bacon\" sprinkled all over it. I LOVE bacon but I couldn't even tell what this stuff was. It tasted like baking soda and salt. It was horrible. The little cinnamon sugary donut-y things they brought to the table prior to bringing out our meal tasted like they were deep fried in oil previously used for cooking some sort of meat.  The coffee was bitter. The staff was friendly and the only reason I'm not giving 1 star.",

The lab flasks with coffee beans on the table is a cute little detail we noticed. The staff were helpful and friendly, and even chatted a bit when we instigated conversation. The menu was a bit scarce, but nonetheless, I ordered a breakfast burrito and my sister got the veggie (and added chicken). I didn't try hers, but mine was amazing: I'm huge on Mexican food and breakfast burritos (I mean, what native Phoenixian isn't?) and I loved how light and fluffy the crepe was in comparison to the tough tortilla. The avocado sauce and touch of chipotle pepper was the perfect balance of light and spicy. We were also greeted with freshly made granola as an appetizer on the house, which was absolutely delicious. I had a chai tea, which was yummy, and I quite liked how they didn't carry any name brand soda products. And of course, free wi-fi is ALWAYS a plus. Love this little bar. Can't wait to come back and I'm back in town.",

Music is on point and always diverse, the colors and artwork inside provide a badass way for you to eat breakfast and feel cooler only to leave and  realize the wall was cooler than you.

I'm pretty knowledgeable about coffee. There are fifty ways from bush to cup to spoil it. They choose the highest quality, Heart beans and prepare them perfectly whether by drip brew or v60 pour-over. The staff will be happy to help you choose the blend you'll most enjoy no matter how busy it gets.   The menu is unique and creative, offering a variety of sweet and savory crepes. Of the savory, my favorites are the Grand Prix (order early!) and 13-mi Vegetable, but everything is very good. The plate presentation of everything is a work of art that stimulates and delights the mind before you taste a morsel. Somehow, even during the busiest periods, they manage to deliver complimentary, tantalizing, exquisite little finger-food before and after your order arrives.   Actually the venue, a casual, strip-mall spot, is incongruous with the surprisingly wonderful food and drink, but to me and my wife, this just adds to the charm. The lack of pretentiousness lets you relax, let down, and have a joyful and memorable time.",

Just an interesting side note :)  You might want to get here early, there are always lines and the food takes a little longer than normal to make, so plan on spending 1.5-2 hours here. With that said... it's totally worth the wait! They give you an option to get sweet or savory crepes, all of which will make you drool just reading through the descriptions! I went with their Breakfast Burrito (savory) crepe and would definitely order it again. So delicious!!!  Also, while waiting for the crepes, they started us out with some homemade granola. This may sound odd, but man oh man, it was amazing! So much so, that I asked if it was possible to buy some. Sure enough, they sell a small ish mason jar for $6. And if you bring the jar back, you can get a refill for $3.  I give this place an A++. The staff was super friendly and the food was even more amazing! Definitely give this place a try!",

We had two different crepes; the Grand Prix and the burro. The flavors of the burro - while definitely southwestern - were poorly balanced. The spices were front and center rather than being complimentary. The crepe itself was heavy and doughy rather than light. The Grand Prix was served with an egg sunny side up with grossly under cooked whites. The crepe was also heavy and doughy and the flavors were poorly balanced. Perhaps our expectations were out of line but 24 bucks for two coffees and 2 below average crepes just seems wrong. Sadly, we won't be back.",

The portion is on the small side, but I don't mind, how about ordering more flavor!  They should totally open a full restaurant and serve dinner. More please, not just crepes.",

In a nutshell, Crepe Bar is a very cool place that serves delicious, well presented food with a side of awesome customer service. It's the small things that mean so much; from your decorative coffee foam, to your complimentary granola while you wait for your order, to your cute marshmallow dessert to wrap things up!  My breakfast buddy went for the tried, but True, Bananas & Nutella. Can't go wrong there! When I saw that the Grand Prix was served only at certain times (which fortuitously married with the time of our visit), I knew it was my destiny to experience the wondrous combo of savory pork belly, crisp pork jowl, sunny side egg, and sweet coffee crepe. Yes, you read right! Coffee. Who knew, right??  Upon my very first bite of pork belly, my eyes rolled up into my head and I just had to close my eyes to fully enjoy the ... dare I say it... fatty goodness of the pork! There I said it! My kinda comfort food. I kept saying I should take some photos, even as i chowed down; the chance of a good picture diminishing as fast as the tasty morsels on my plate.  Two thumbs up! Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu, though not sure if I dare face the wait times on weekends as mentioned by the other reviewers.",

It's bustling and noisy inside, which I enjoy but may be a negative to some.  The crepes are reasonably priced, and they come with a salad and an unexpected appetizer portion of granola.  The crepes were good but not excellent, and the portions were a little smaller than expected.  Unfortunately, during peak times, you can expect a difficult time finding a seat, and a long wait for your food.  Also, the options for non-pork eaters such as myself were limited.  This place is ideal for killing time sipping coffee on a weekend, but not for much else.",

Excellent coffee as well. We also were given a little sample of the granola. It was a little salty for my tastes but not bad. Overall, I would say this is a great little breakfast place. It's too bad they don't have a few more tables and possibly table service (this is an order at the counter type place); however, all of the staff were really friendly and helpful. The only real negative was the location, which is unfortunately in a strip mall. I hope they have a lot of success and can afford to move to a place with some atmosphere. Regardless, I will definitely return to try the sweet crepe offerings.",

The line moved incredibly fast and the team that was preparing the food was super efficient.

The First Time dessert crepe is to die for, as well as the Chicken Griddle.  Be sure to try one of the Grown Up Sodas they have in the fridge. I spoke to the owner about them and he just got them and they are fantastic!

The place is small, but nicely painted--whoever designed (& painted!) did a great job!  But the menu is the masterpiece.  There is a savory and a sweet menu.  My friend ordered from the sweet side and I ordered from the savory side.  It was really hard to choose with so many creative combinations!  I chose the Grand Prix, which is a coffee crepe, large cubes of pork belly, small cubes of pork jowl, an \"egg up\" as they call it, with some maple syrup to enhance everything.  My friend got the Cherry French Toast (not the menu name-they have a much more clever name than that).  It was large enough that she shared a quarter piece of the 1\" thick toast with me.  What we both noticed pretty quickly is that this kitchen likes to offset the sweet with a good dose of salt--think of salted caramel.  I ate all of mine but my friend couldn't finish hers.   By the end the flavors were almost a bit too much.  I would give them a second (& maybe a third) try though.",

But it appears that when the wheels fell off the truck, rather than calling triple AAA, they simply set up shop with some bricks and a lil' mortar.  The nutella-banana crepe was as good as I remember, but the star was the breakfast burrito!  This burrito is now the benchmark as to which all breakfast burritos will be compared.  The crepe takes the place of the ol' flour tortilla, and boy, what an upgrade! The crepe was super delicious on its own, but then when you add fluffy eggums and mexican cheese and whatnot, man, I wanted to order a second one...   Also, the latte's were delightful!  We are sure to be back :)",

Awkward as it seems, wouldn't drip coffee be made fresh and served to individuals as ordered?  Not to mentioned, when you offer only a select number of beverages, you would think the quality would be good not mediocre. The guy did offer me an Americano (also served lukewarm) and not good at all. As for my lunch; I had the burro and it was bland, nothing spectacular and I was still hungry 30 minutes later.  Let it be known, I did add the potato on the side  for an additional cost and to my surprise, I could count on my fingers how many pieces were served.  Next time, I'll donate a bag of potatoes from Fry's and maybe I can get 1/2 a cut of potato. This hippy, small joint was busy but I'm not sure why as the food was not very good and the service was slow.",

I suspect they did not have a kitchen floorspace or staff adequate to meet demand.    The staff was friendly and considerate and the decor was pleasant.    While not terrible, it was not really worth the wait or the price.  I doubt I will go back.",

She got the papa k with ham, pepper jack and mushrooms and I got the veggie stack. The expertly prepared high quality ingredients resulted in hard core multiple crepegasms.  We wrapped up our crepe escape with the vanilla bean custard crepe served with berries. They won't give it to you to go but stop crying and just eat it there - it's totally worth the 5 minutes.   I suspect the ambiance in this place is pretty cute but I was so hypnotized by what was happening in my mouth (and a hot chef) that I can't really remember much about the decor.  Even if these crepes were being served out of a dumpster I'd still be back to try everything on the menu.",

Be prepared for a long wait in the order line (10-25 min) and a long wait to receive your order (30-40 min).    This is not Burger King.  The food is fresh and made from scratch so it takes time.  The food was so fresh that I was trying to peek in the kitchen to see if they were harvesting the veggies, milking a cow, and picking eggs from under the chickens.  We ordered the Papa K with scrambled eggs and an entree with chipotle crepes.  Both were incredibly good and served hot.  The coffee was good but I do wish that they offered decaf.  There were quite a few kids there and I did not hear any complaints from them.  We sat outside and it was chilly (ok, it was about 59 degrees.  You get spoiled with the weather.)  For you with small dogs, we saw a water dish outside so I presume that they are dog friendly although we did not see any.  If you are not in a rush to dine, you will be very pleased with the quality of the food.",

Made with cola bean extract, caramel, and cane syrup, it has good flavor and is less sweet.  95 calories per bottle.  Yes, it is different, but a premium product.    I had their brulee desert crepe today.  Tasty mildly sweet crepe with caramelized sugar on top.  Nice.  But, they also served some sliced strawberries, a few blueberries and some candied orange peel as a garnish.  One thing common to all the dishes I have sampled is they are a little better than I thought possible.    Strawberries taste pretty bland these days.  I use to pick strawberries at a local \"you pick it\" farm.  Most of the fresh red strawberries never made it into my bucket.  The days of finding great tasting strawberries that you did not personally grow are over.    At Crepe Bar, the commercial strawberries are infused with flavor by processing in a vacuum (sous vide) with simple syrup, vanilla and other spices.  Result, great tasting strawberries.   And, the blueberries were pickled.  Lots of wow factor.    Expect food that tastes a little better than you thought possible at the Crepe Bar.",

    "text": "I love sweet crepes.  Picked up my mom from the airport, and went to try this place. Being a small restaurant, guests are to stand in line and order at the register with a girl using an iPad.  I saw on the online menu, sugar crepe, with optional $0.50 added for strawberries.  She said I cannot pay extra for the strawberries on the sugar crepe, and I must purchase the vanilla bean crepe for the strawberries.  I didn't want the vanilla creme.  (But I'm glad I did, because it was delicious.)  The problem is, they gave us a small bowl of popcorn (like 8 popcorns...) that were soggy, cold, and UNBELIEVABLY SALTY.  My mom ate it first, and told me they were salty.  So I tried, and within a micro second, I spit it out into my hand.  Revolting; it was unbearable.  I went up to the counter to return those awful popcorn, and let them know it's absolutely inedible.  I got myself some napkins and cups of water (ALL SELF SERVICE, btw).  Then, they brought out a bowl with TWO potato chips.  TWO pieces.  And, it had the SAME seasoning as those disgusting popcorns.  Scared to try, but bit into it; immediately spitted out.  I mean, we didn't ask for these.  Please don't offer nasty freebies.  Don't these people have any taste buds???  Then, the breakfast burrito crepe.  Nasty, with sour garnish.  I wanted to return the item but my mother was trying to be nice and told me it was okay.  It was extremely salty again.  Seriously, the chef's tongue must've been under anesthesia.  The bacon tasted horribly artificial.  Extremely soggy texture, really disgusting.  I must say though, the vanilla crepe was pleasant.  (As I'm reading others' reviews here, I would also be really pissed off if they were out of it.)  Seriously does not make sense that they cannot charge us to add strawberries. Maybe I should order sugar crepes, go to a grocery store & pick up some berries, and eat at home.  NAH, NOT WORTH visiting again.  Oh yea, and the amount of food on the plate is smaller than the size of your hand, for about $8 including tax & tip.  (Someone here wrote it's cheap.  WTF?) I wish I had not tipped but already had, as you have to pay when you order in the line before receiving any service.  Oh wait what service?  There was no service other than delivering the food.  Might as well make us pick up the food at the counter too.  Why bother having servers when we have to order in line, pick up napkins, and fetch drinks ourselves?  And, it is very very noisy inside.  I don't understand the 4.5 stars.  Are they trying to be hip & trendy?  I've had various fine dining.  This ain't it; only looks stupid & pretentious.",

It was hopping - not necessarily full to bursting, but with a steady stream of people - when we visited and our food took a long time to get to us. They brought out a bowl of housemade granola for us to munch on while we were waiting. It was a gorgeous day outside and we brought games with us. No hurry, but thank you for looking out for us.   You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom, so I'm also assuming big group assembly here is tough because they don't have a ton of space.  The menu isn't super expensive but you don't get the portion sizes you would ordering breakfast from a diner or sandwich place, either. An order of potatoes (for a $1.00 upcharge) granted us about sixteen centimeter cubes of potato sprinkled over the crepe. Boo.   The breakfast burro is very salty. The bacon is salty, there's definitely seasoning in the crepe itself and in the eggs. And then the plate is sprinkled with flake salt. That was too much. There was very little of the avocado inside, as well. Now, what it has it in is awesome. It didn't feel like an accurate description.  The drip coffee was nice - they were advertising Ethiopian so I'm assuming that's what I got. Slightly fruity. The only sweetener available was Truvia - I hadn't tried it before and it works differently than other sweeteners. (Not a problem just an observation.)  I may see you again, Crepe Bar. You're a short jog from the highway and both the dog and people watching was nice.",

They always bring out a unexpected appetizer while you are waiting for your food!   They have so many delicious food options that my boyfriend and I can never order just two things... It's always three! One savory and two sweet!   My favorite way to start the day.",

They gave me a crispy crape (very hard and a little bit burn) after I waited for an hour. I went there at 7am to avoid the wait. I do not understand why it took so long when there was only few people waiting for food. I asked for a exchange. They just redo the crepe and gave me the old meat and egg on the top of the new crepe. Therefore, the pork belly and egg are cold. The pork belly is very dry and too salty. Also, pancetta is missing from my plate. My husband got a DLT. It is very very very salty. The chocolate cookie is very dry too. The coffee is too sour. The portion is a lot smaller than before the construction too. I really do not enjoy today breakfast. I hope it is just a temporary thing.",

It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either.   I came in around 10am and it looked like every table was taken but luckily I found 1 table inside that was available.

Coffee is just as amazing as the food and the service has been really improved upon. On more than one occasion, a small plate of food is brought before me as a snack by the chefs in the kitchen. I like surprise snacks that are delicious. Who does this?! To be fair, I frequent during off peak times so be prepared for a full house on the weekends. Prices are reasonable and portions are plenty.

One, slightly awkward jont toward the back, and you will be greeted warmly by the cashier, handed a menu, and invited to stand in line.  We took our order to-go, so whilst waiting, observed a VERY well-run kitchen, wait staff, barista and FOH staff. Upon dining in our home, enjoyed the creative take on what we know as a crepe (The Burrito and Jamaican Jerk), which was super delicious! Congrats on a great restaurant. We'll be back!",

The lemon drop crepe came with a lemon curd sauce that had just the right amount of lemon flavor.   The staff is always super friendly and even give you something to snack on while you wait for your food. This is a restaurant to go to when you're not in a rush (especially on the weekend) because it's pretty small and usually busy. But totally worth the wait. We only waited about 20 minutes for our food today even though it was crowded. Their coffee is also great. I usually get a honey latte and it's perfect!

Regardless, the environment was very modern and made good use of a fairly small space. I would have preferred chairs with backs to stools, but that wasn't by any means the end of the world.   I had the cheesecake crepe ($7.50), and my friend had the nutella and banana ($5.50). My crepe wasn't bad, but I would have preferred a little more of the cheesecake filling. It was good, but not anything spectacular; I was expecting a lot more from this place based on the other Yelp reviews that I've read. I didn't have any of the nutella and banana crepe, but my friend complained multiple times that it was overwhelmingly sweet -this coming from a girl who happily eats nutella straight out of the jar.   I had the heart drip coffee because you get one for free if you check in on Yelp, and I was not a fan. I feel like a place like this should have some pretty solid coffee to accompany the crepes and pastries they serve, but it was mediocre at best.   Overall, it was a pretty standard experience. It wasn't bad, but also not anything mindblowing. Next time, I'll probably just stick to P. Croissant right next door.",

    "text": "This place is seriously yummy! My boyfriend came here a few weeks ago to try a unique breakfast.  I ordered the Grand Prix and a cappuccino. They were both delicious. The cappuccino was served in a cute cup and of course had a nice little design on the top. The Grand Prix is a pork lovers dream. The crepe itself is good but the real star of the show is the pork belly.  It is so tender, sweet, and succulent. And the maple sauce just takes it over the edge. Luckily the portion isn't too big or else you would probably go into a coma after eating this much deliciousness.  My boyfriend had the first time and really loved it. Bananas and Nutella, can't really go wrong. Both crepes were presented beautifully and we even got a free treat to snack on while we waited for our food.   I would highly recommend this cute and tasty cafe!",

We also got a little sample from the chef. After we got our food, he checked on us and our coffee was refilled quickly.   While we waited we shared the \"mole\" cookie which was super yummy with the coffee. Try if you can.   Tried two savory crepes- Breakfast Burro and the Grand Prix. This is the first time I had a savory crepe, just a little FYI. The hubby liked the Grand Prix and would have again. I also enjoyed the burro, except that the menu said it had bacon. There was some \"sprinkles\" in there, and maybe some with the eggs but not enough to taste or see it. I would have the chorizo instead and no potatoes. I wanted a lot more of those too.   I would go back... I have to try the sweet crepes!",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to go on the days I actually wake up in time for breakfast/ brunch. Their crepes are original and full of bold flavors. I like that you can always distinguish each ingredient when you take a bite. Having said that, some times the combination can get a like too salty for my taste like in the smoked turkey crepe. The chorizo and the gouda are a good combo but the smokiness of the gouda adds to the saltiness of the chorizo. But this is one of the few places I have found that does the savory crepes right.   The sweet crepes are awesome with the combination of simple toppings with a twist. My favorite is the vanilla bean with the nut du jour. I also love the fact that most of the time they come around with some of their in-house cereal for you to snack on while you get your food, as well as a small dessert to try.  Next on my list is to try the Grand Prix crepe which they only serve 7am-11am. Either they sell out or I'm too late, but I am determined to try it eventually.",

    "text": "Once again, I'm reminded of a place I visited and that I enjoyed, but allowed to drop off my food radar.  I guess for a while I traveled so much last year that it's not too hard to imagine I'd forget about a few places.  I remember my first 2 stops in to the brick and mortar of what used to be Trucking Good Food.  I really did enjoy the food.  Almost a year since my last visit and today was no different.  I stopped in today for a lunch, solo.  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken savory crepe and I also ordered the Sugar/Bruleed Crepe just to have a taste.  The Buffalo chicken crepe <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#gouRfEaEXqFqRmQbKNUsOw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a> was sided with a shaved pickled carrot mixture.  I don't eat a lot of \"bready\" foods, but by gholly, this is one dish that I can just dig into.  The buffalo-blue cheese sauce was delicious.  Not as spicy as I like, but still good and definitely not to salty as some sauces like this can be.  The sauce was not in a quantity to make the dish messy and hide the texture of the crepe.  The crepe was delicate and thin and moist.  I loved it.  it would have been nice to have some fresh bleu cheese with it though.    I should have gotten something on my sweet crepe.  I thought the Sugar Crepe would  be a little sweeter.  Still, it was delicious for a small taste of something sweet after lunch with a cup of coffee.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr%C3%AApe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#MY2V3YAlEVwkb5yXIhCfgw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/crep...</a>  I discovered that the Crepe bar now carries Hayden Flour Mills products.  The fact that this company is attempting to bring back native grains to AZ is a great story.  If you're not familiar, check it out.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.haydenflourmills.com%2F&s=c0151cf8bcb9c6fe8da3f59aa6d4eb95a0364a23a3bf6739463e8484b3ecb25f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">haydenflourmills.com</a>  You can buy some of their products at CB now.    My last review still stands!!!!  Where are the duck fat fries?  I did ask about the, but it looks like there is no plan to bring them back.  I have to monitor Facebook and Twitter to find out if they are on special.  which pretty much means, I probably won't have theirs again.  *sad face*",

They have a little coffee bar to the side of the cashier. I ordered the Burrito and a caramel sea salt iced latte. While we waited a small sampler of granola was given to our table. It was amazing, very sweet but I have a bit of a sweet tooth myself. Soon the barista called out our names and we went and picked up our drinks. The latte was pretty good, however I couldn't taste the caramel or sea salt very well. The espresso wasn't very strong either. Not too much longer I received my crepe. The presentation was beautiful! Again it tasted pretty good, although I thought the flavor of the chorizo was a bit lacking. With more avocado, and perhaps some pico to brighten the flavor palette the plate would be a lot yummier. There was also a sauce on the plate mainly for presentation, but it was amazing! I wish there was more on the crepe itself. Next time I'll try a sweeter crepe.",

Grand prix - coffee crepe, pork belly, espresso maple, chili aioli, egg up. It's rich and VERY VERY FLAVORFUL. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and the hint of sweet from the maple and accents of coffee makes it the best crepe I've ever had! If I'm anywhere in the Phoenix area, I'm going to make a pit stop here for the Grand Prix crepe!  The brioche is housemade and sooo good! Also highly recommend the French Toast Brioche: caramelized apples & figs, pure maple, whipped cream. It's not overly sweet and the figs are sooo perfectly matched to the bread. Yummy!  My friend really enjoyed her sweet crepe. She's had a several and says they're all good.",

This place is drool worthy. From the moment we arrived, with the smiling attention (verging on too friendly) while we stood in line trying to absorb all the various options and their detailed descriptions, we knew this would be a memorable experience. We decided on the coffee Crepe with pork belly and the chilaquiles as our savory dishes, and the mission fig Crepe for the sweet.   While waiting, they dropped off free samples of their homemade granola. Brilliant marketing move!! This granola is sooooo out of the world. All 3 of us decided to each purchase a bag to savor later at home. I'm still enjoying my bag and wish I had picked up more. Note to self for next time.   The pork belly with coffee was an amazing combo. Slightly earthy combo and the belly was oh so tender. The chilaquiles was tasty and novel in that they fried up the crepe so that it was crispy \"chips\". I'm drooling as I remember eating these. Finally, the fig Crepe was just as amazing on the opposite end. Not too sweet, lovely dollops of local honey, and generous with the figs.   I can't wait to take the fam here. It's worth many, many more visits.",

I found them thanks to Yelp and their redic amount of reviews. It definitely is busy on the weekends, mostly in part to their limited seating and popularity. I arrived a little early to grab seats and luckily was able to get a table for us. One of the employees greeted me as I sat down, and cleaned off the table because I staked claim right after the former claimants got up. The ordering line definitely skews toward long, but it's worth it!   The cold brew is not bottomless, but if you ask for a few cups of ice, you can always make their bottomless hot coffee a cold option. As much as I loved my burrito crepe [dat chorizo tho], I had severe FOMO looking at my friends inhaled ate their sweet crepes.   We were making plans to return as we left - it was that great!

We ordered at the counter, picked an empty table, and then had a couple small appetizers brought out. We weren't expecting the additional dishes but really enjoyed the tempura bread. We had also ordered one of the bread with figs and honey and it was a good combination of sweet with a little savory.  I ordered the chorizo chipotle crepe burrito and my husband had the paprika chicken crepe. Neither of us loved our crepes - maybe we're not savory crepe people. Service was excellent, I enjoyed the ambiance, and the bread dishes were both good. 3.5 stars.",

The outer appearance looks like a regular store but the inside is really cute cafe interior. The walls have nice paintings of coffee and dessert landscape.   There was a waiting line to order and it was fast paced so didn't wait long and the service was pretty quick.   We ordered chocolate sundae crepe, chicken crepe and spiced latte. The chocolate sundae was pretty appealing with strawberries, Banana and nuts. The crepe as such was not overpoweringly sweet but after getting through the plate it kind of went over the top. Chicken crepe was delicious and the chick pea along with it gave a Mediterranean taste. I preferred that over the sweet one. Coffee was a huge disappointment, it costed $4.50 and there was no spices and was a regular coffee.   Overall a good place to have breakfast, price is decent and for two with coffee costs $30",

They serve you a complimentary glass of milk and tea biscuits and house made granola--what could be better??  I will say the options are limited, but I've never been disapppinted. Their savory crepes are some of the best I've E V E R had. Also 10/10 on presentation. You can probably find cheaper crepes around, but you are paying for the quality here.   The location makes it hard to find and you'll want to experience this place when it's not too busy to get the full effect. It's on the smaller side and fills up fast. Also be sure to check the hours because they close early! But I recommend Crepe Bar over every other nearby Crepe spot in tempe. So it's worth the effort friends. IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT.",

The hibiscus jam and lemon curd Crepe is honestly so disappointing compared to how it used to be. There was no form than just a thumb-sized portion of jam on the entire plate. They decreased the portion from two crepes to just one, so now you're paying for one crepe with half a cup of lemon curd and a dot of jam.  The chipotle burrito was completely liquid mush in the center and is half of the size of how it used to be.  Now you definitely need two dishes to be full here. This was really disappointing.",

We used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola, which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor.  Then our savory crepes came out quickly, the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of Gouda, with local ham).  Mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well.  I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs.  As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.  Overall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!",

Like a bleached white hole in the wall bakery with croissants so perfectly wonderful that they sold out almost every day well before noon.   Not we have the Crepe Bar occupying this suite.  An interesting addition to the neighborhood and an intriquing option I felt the need to try, at least once.   After reading reviews and then scanning the menu we decided to share a savory and a sweet crepe from the menu.  Darn good too. May not be worth the price for he papa k with egg.  A three egg omelette will cost you about that much, with toast and hash browns. But this was a welcome change from the usual and darn near ideal for the weather and the day. Will be coming back again to try one of the other options on the menu.  Hopefully soon. I think the yelp symbol for price range should be $$... I guess I'm sort of a fan but I don't anticipate becoming a regular at this place.  Prices just didn't seem reseaonable for the options available. Also, the first time we came in there were no crepes because of an event the were participating in or something.  That wasn't so good. ONLY because of the location did we decide to give this place another try.",

This is my number one place to recommend to friends and each and every one of them loves it just as much as I do. Classic favorite for me is the Papa K, but everything is delicious. Honestly, it's like asking me what my favorite song is...impossible to choose! Oh! I definitely don't want to forget to mention their amazingly creative seasonal goodness...

Unfortunately, I had been there three times but only successfully dine at this cafe once (even they expanded and I came here 7:45 am sharp and there were still no seats!)    Their food was amazing!  Both sweet and savory crepes from their limited availability menu were pretty unique.  We had tried a savory crepe with pork cheek and a sweet crepe with chocolate and rose mashmallow.  Both of them tasted so heavenly.     All crepes made with love and best food took time to make.

I also got a Moroccan latte and a lemon drop crepe to-go for dessert.   That day, the 13mi veg had beets and (I think) leeks. It also had some pickled carrots with a cheese cracker thing on top. The veggies with the french masala was a little tangier than I would have liked. It wasn't bad at all, it just was too vinegary for me with the carrot pickles and everything. I think it would have been awesome with some parsnips in there with the beets. The cheese thing on top was good too.   I got the Moroccan latte with 2% milk (finally a coffee place that has more than whole and skim!). It was good.   I'm usually not a big fan of lemon flavoured foods, but because the guy (whose name I can't remember) highly recommended it, I got it. Plus it has hibiscus gel in it, so that softened the lemon flavour. It was nice. I liked it.   I decided to go back a couple days later, and I got the First Time (nutella and banana crepe) and a vanilla latte. As expected, both were good.   The employees are super nice, and the food is good. I will definitely be going back esp. since I didn't have to go far to get there.",

There weren't even any tables open, we thought we were going to have to get food to go and sit at the restaurant next door! Luckily a table opened up and we snagged it right away. There was also a bit of a line but it seemed to move pretty quickly. It was smaller in there than I had expected but it was cool! It had a coffee house-type vibe which I liked! Was very clean too. I was excited to check in on yelp to get a free tea! I decided on a loose leaf earl grey. It wasn't my fave tea, but it was free so I can't complain. There were two savory vegetarian crepe options. I thought the horseradish on the buckwheat one would be too much for me so I went for the 13mi Vegetable crepe. I also spilt a first time for dessert, which is Nutella and banana! Presentation for both was A+, very fancy, I loved it! One downside is that portions are small though. Would be a good place to come for a light meal, but I wouldn't recommend if you are wanting a good hearty meal, unless you're down to be spending a lot. Something that I liked about the vegetable crepe was the variety of vegetables in it, lots of my favorites too and they all tasted fresh. I also enjoyed the difficult to eat parmesan crisp on top. I appreciate that they use lots of local stuff there too! The crepe was a tad spicier than expected and I wasn't super into the spices used in it and stuff, but it wasn't bad! I did like it overall. The first time was delicious, very simple and tasty. I especially liked the banana on top. Typically when I go out for brunch I personally want a huge meal so for that reason this place wasn't my absolute favorite. However, it was a great introduction to the world of crepes for me and I am glad I had the opportunity to try it out!",

I checked in and got my pour of Heart coffee from PDX (I was told) for free and didn't have to stand in line to get it; they let me show my check in at the coffee bar station and sent me on my way back to my table. The service was friendly and efficient. They make you feel at home with the amuse bouche. A great touch that is thoughtful and classy w/o feeling over the top or like too much. I really wish it was the norm at more places in the US. It shows they care about the customer. (It's the little things, right?)  These guys really have it down. My wife had the breakfast burro (chipotle crepe, chorizo, avocado, I forget what else) and said it was perfect.  She raved and said it was the best breakfast she's had in PHX in several years. I had the andouille (w/ pimento cheese, potatoes and egg sunny side up). I wish my egg was a bit more runny, but the flavor combos and complexity of the dish was top notch. Then we had the lemon drop crepe b/c our cashier said it was a staff favorite; (and I believe her) I would be hard pressed to find another crepe that would beat it. We'll get it again that's for sure. I also had a perfect macchiato.  Finally, the fresh sea salt and chipotle salt and rock sugar they use to finish on the crepes (respectively) is an awesome touch that enhances the flavor profiles.   I am glad we tried Crepe bar and will certainly be back soon. These guys have carved out a niche and do what they do really well!",

Sunday brunch seems to be a very busy time. It was a long wait to order and long wait to get food. Go before the rush if you can.  Smoked olives appetizer was yummy, so that abated my hunger a bit during the long wait. I ordered the veg crepe, boyfriend ordered the breakfast burro. The breakfast burro was too heavy for my tastes, but I enjoyed my veg crepe a lot. It's basically like a samosa in a crepe, with a little fried/baked cheese on top. You get the tamarind and mint sauce you usually get with samosas.  Yummy breakfast/brunch place, but go early if you can to avoid the rush!",

It was Friday little after 11 and the place was busy, but not overly busy, I was able to get my order in and find me a seat. I have to say I love the vibe of this place.  I originally went seeking a savory crepe, but after looking over the menu I went with a savory & sweet crepe. Oh boy, this was not a good diet day. Haha  I ordered the breakfast burrito crepe, eggs, bacon, queso jack, avocado salsa. Let me tell you, this was amazing, it took an entirely different perspective on the breakfast burrito, and the chipotle crepe just made it that much better! The flavors of everything blended perfectly, was surprised when I noticed I ate it all :( where did it go? Who did that?    I also ordered the first time, I was sold on this because it was with Nutella - that stuff is crack!!! Love it!!!.  The crepe was beautifully prepared it was filled with that glorious Nutella (either you love Nutella or you hate it) and surrounded by mind blowing banana brulee OOHHH MMMYYY FFFFFNNNN GGGGGAAAAAWWWWDDD!!! Banana Brulee Who thought of this!! Bananas with crispy sugar coating mixed with Nutella!!! Genius!!!!   Crepe Bar expect to see me on a regularly basis!",

    "text": "We came here almost once a week when we lived in the Phoenix area - and now that we live in Los Angeles, we miss it like crazy. We simply haven't found anything out here that can hold a candle to this place!  The owner, Jeff, is serious about using fresh, local ingredients and combines them to make one-of-a-kind quality dishes that you can't get out of your head. Our favorites were the many different flavors of scones and the savory crepes. I'm not usually a cookie person, but whenever I saw that they had coffee cookies, I had to snag one before it was gone. Also, their toast showed me what the toast craze was all about. Biting into a slice was a delight, and somehow I always came away feeling like it was exactly the right amount of food. Their absurdly good scrambled eggs made me realize that I make mine all wrong; somehow, these taste better than you would ever think scrambled eggs could.  Their coffee is good, but they especially shine in their espresso bar drinks. Their cappuccinos were expertly made, and I also enjoyed their iced special drinks during the summer. The vibe was also perfect - very hip and airy without feeling like a carbon copy of the latest trends. It can be a bit difficult for a big group, but they do have a few larger tables. Their music always put me in a good mood with its mix of indie and oldies, and it was just loud enough to create a fun atmosphere without being so loud that you can't hear each other talk.   Lastly, let me say a good word about the service. They acknowledge you when you walk in the door, remember you when you return, greet you by name, and make you feel like they appreciate your business. Sometimes, depending on how busy they are, they will even bring over little treats like small bowls of granola - it makes you feel valued as a customer and helps keep your tummy from growling too much before your food arrives.  Don't let the long line intimidate you - it is 100% worth it!! Thinking about this place always brings a smile to my face, and if we come back to South Tempe for a visit, this will be at the top of our list! Crepe Bar is the best of the best!",

Indie sounding music, lower than average lighting and minimalist table and chair arrangements contributed to an overall hip and trendy vibe.  I came alone and craved quiet so sat outside at the long tabletop with about 4-5 high chairs. Even though it faced a parking lot, the morning sun and birds chirping in the palm trees nearby contributed to a laid back feeling perfect to greet the day.  Enjoyed an excellent savory crepe called \"Papa K\" with ingredients listed as \"Hassayampa ham, eggs, pepper cheese & roasted mushroom\". I chose to wrap all that in their \"alternative Crepe batter\" made from buckwheat & chickpea. It included a small side salad of mostly arugula. Helped slide that down with sips of their macchiato expresso which completed my overall excellent experience.",

    "text": "Crepe bar has a very relaxed vibe and minimalist decoration. Every piece of art work on the walls is for sale a meal and a art gallery interesting concept.   They have various crepe options savory and sweet we tried a few. Portions were a bit small in my opinion, so this would be more of a light morning meal. Don't expect to find a soda fountain they do offer glass bottles of coke and a few other can drinks. There is a large water pitcher where you can serve yourself and if you want ice, with these hot temperatures I imagine most would, you will have to ask at the counter.    The chilaquiles crepes were tasty it had a unique favor, the second time crepes was sweet. I personally would eat it as a dessert or accompanied with other protein sides such as  eggs or potatoes.   You seat yourself and you can pick up  a menu by the register and when your ready you can place your order at the counter.",

The staff was very friendly and helpful. We settled on Grand Prix and Chilaquiles.   Grand Prix had pork belly which had nice flavor and was not very fatty. It was melt in your mouth texture and it paired perfectly with over easy egg and the crepe wrapper.  I can see this one being ordered along with a vegetarian crepe to round out the meal.   The  Chilaquiles was also nice flavor and it had tasty bean topping along with egg. It is served with tortilla chips rather than crepe wrapper. Good choice if you want something light and healthy.   We also tried their sweet crepe, the Second Chance. It was very good, perfect texture and sweetness. Fresh bananas and strawberries were spot on.   I also tried their Moroccan latte. It was interesting and I'm glad I tried it. It had nice cinnamon flavor. I'd like to try their other flavors next. Enjoy!",

I have actually never had one of their sweet crepes, but I'm sure they are great like everything else.  Crepe Bar tends to be pretty crowded all the time, so you may have to wait for a table. Don't worry though, the food comes out fast and tables turn quickly. I pretty much only get two things here.  Burrito Crepe: If you're on the fence about crepes, but like virtually anything in burrito form, this is the ticket. It's essentially a chorizo breakfast burrito, but has a crispy crepe instead of a tortilla. Need I say more?  Grand Prix: This is what I order when I want to mix it up or am feeling fancy AF. It's a little more out there, but the flavors work really well. It has pork belly and some kind of espresso drizzle. Really good, but rather rich. Great if you're in the mood for that.   Side note: They have really good granola. Consider bringing home a bag as it's delicious. They give you a little bowl of it while you wait to get you hooked.",

Not to spicy and great flavor and felt home made   The crepes alone are award winning we got the burrito crepe and pork belly omg.  Loaded of flavor and taste and just melts in your mouth on every bite. The present it amazingly and just ready to dive in.

I've had the crepe chip one (chilaquiles, or however it's spelt, it's paprika-y and delicious, with Crepe chips, which is just so good!!! ), the tahini chicken (FILLING and wonderful with a tangy crunch from the pickles), the chipotle chicken one (very filling and very good) and the ode to Sunday one (i think that was the name. It was ode to something). In the future I want to try the rest of their crepes, especially their vegetarian ones because veggies are delicious.

We were greeted by a lovely hostess/order-taker girl and I decided on the First Time while my boyfriend had the Breakfast Burrito.  He had a coffee, and I OJ.  Before sitting we asked if there was a bathroom to wash our hands as we smelled of dog.  The owner, clearly a dog lover let us wash our hands in their private bathroom in the kitchen.    (Watching people make crepes is beautiful. Like an art form)   We thank them profusely and sit down.  The food comes and both of our meals are dreams.  I will say I was not prepared for how sweet my meal would be that early in the morning, but it was so decadent and scrumptious. I might not get it again unless I'm in more of a dessert mood, but I like more savory breakfasts. There will be the sweet-toothers out there that will be titalated at the idea.  I smelled a buffalo chicken while I was there and will DEFINITELY be trying that out next time.  Now for anyone that knows me I absolutely detest eggs. I hate them and think they're gross. Then came the Crepe Bar Breakfast Burrito... ::swoon::! This is the ONLY DISH IN THE WORLD THUS FAR THAT I HAVE BEEN WILLING TO EAT WITH EGG BECAUSE IT IS SO DAMN GOOD!!!  I was actually jealous that my boyfriend had it and I didn't, since he has the sweet tooth and I die for savory.  He devoured his meal giving me a few small bites, but that thing is AMAZING!!! I might have one of my own next time dependent on whether or not the buffalo sounds better.  I love this little place, down to the art on the walls and the well decorated walls.  I even love that you pay with a Square card reader and an iPad. It feels like a pop-up art gallery.  Great vibe.  We live all the way out in Laveen, and will make a point to come here WHENEVER we can.  Thank you!!!",

The head chef is truly talented and goes the extra mile to make each crepe an experience. Their coffee is fantastic as well. This is by far my favorite breakfast place I have ever been to anywhere.

    "text": "Just went here for the first time yesterday for my wife's graduation party. First off going to comment on how hip this place decorated on the inside; I wasn't expecting such a clean, slick look.  The food was amazing. I had the breakfast chorizo burrito crepe, half of my wife's ode to a Sunday, and some of my friends avocado toast. The  eggs, chorizo, jack, salsa and avocado were done in a way that allowed them to melt inside of the crepe to perfection. The spicy mayo and cotija laid on the outside of the plate gave a nice dipping option like a traditional burrito and the amount laid out was enough not to overtake what was inside of the crepe. My wife's crepe looked like a dessert tray from the melting the pot. It tasted delicious and I would recommend it for someone who loves sweets. The avocado toast w/ open face egg was also delectable. Our waitress brought out tons of side dishes on the house, including some funnel cake like treats, sweet potato chips, granola, and these crazy dense chocolate house made rollo's that were packed with insane flavors. On top of the amazing service, they allowed us to bring champagne for the celebration and sold us orange juice for mimosas. This is probably one of the better breakfast places in all of Tempe and the best in South Tempe. Looking forward to going back and trying the pork belly and Jamaican jerk sausage crepes.",

I talked about how wonderful this place was & how delicious it is & just the overall atmosphere was so chill. When we went to order, my friend who has server food allergies found a crepe she like & could eat and ordered it, unwrapped without the crepe. I was really taken back when they said they couldn't do that because that have to present the food in a certain manner, REALLY? Completely ridiculous if you ask me, haven't been back since which is a bummer.",

    "text": "Crepe Bar is an awesome place for a culinary experience! I randomly met Jeff (the owner) at another favorite restaurant of mine and as we are both foodies. We hit it off and hung out for a couple hours that evening.  I told Jeff that I would be in some time in the near future to check out his establishment.  As life gets busy and he is not located super close to me some time went by, and I was finally able to make it in today for a glorious meal!  I did not look at a menu, I just asked Jeff to serve me whatever his best dishes are.  He started off with the CB Cereal which is a small helping of home made cereal with oats, almonds, pistachio and stone fruit.  Excellent start to the meal as it was original and very tasty.  The next course was some Noble bread served with Rosemary, Honey, and a house made butter which was outstanding.  I was caught off guard with the next course which was the Octopus Crepes which included a little humus, chorizo, cotija, and adobo and avacado.  Now that dish was a flavor explosion!  My final dish was a Coffee Creme Brulee which was the perfect ending to an awesome meal!  Go check out Crepe Bar, I promise you will be happy!!",

Their FB menu link went live.\" And so we were off - mom, lil sister and I - hungry, hyped, and ready for all kinds of tomcrepery (it's a word now).   The play-by-play:  Breakfast burrito (sans bacon) - egg, cheese, chipotle crepe, avocado salsa. \"The best part is the crepe. I just crunched a huge piece of fleur de sel.\" \"What? I can't hear you over the salsa-egg symphony in my mouth.\" \"Why not everything just be crepes?\"  3 mini crepes - spicy buffalo chicken, carrot slaw, blue cheese.  \"Would have been better as a taco. The slaw needs taco.\" \"The flavor is good, but it's all kinda mushy. It does need the crunch.\" \"Wait... it's not one of each kind of those crepes?\"  Griddled chicken crepe (sans everything) - chicken, cheese, crepe. \"Dude, you ordered a quesadilla.\" \"A fancy quesadilla.\" \"Sorry for eating all the edges... the crispy cheese and fluffy crepe were meant to be together. In my stomach.\"  Vanilla custard crepe - dressed strawberries, caramel, crepe rolls. \"There are three crepe rolls! Perfect!\" \"Omg taste the brulee'd top part.\" \"Why not everything just be vanilla bean custard? Mor custerd!\"  Yogurt parfait - lemon gel, berries, spelt & pistachio granola. \"This granola is salty... it's so good.\" \"Oh, there's fruit and stuff on the bottom. Dig!\" \"What is this stuff? Not quite yogurt... not quite whipped cream. Lemon fluff. Mmm.\"  Almond milk latte + Chai tea - \"What do you mean there's no decaf coffee?\" \"The coffee's sweet. Not intense. Not quite Village Roastery, but still good.\" \"I am still in awe of this Chai. It's perfection.\"  Complementary cookies in coffee milk - \"This is like Cookie Crisp for grown-ups.\" \"I'm putting a cookie piece in the vanilla custard crepe. Brilliant.\" \"They should make that a thing! Cookies and cream crepe.\"  TL;DR- The service is friendly and cheery, the lemon parfait was really something special, and the vanilla custard crepe and breakfast burrito are also worth a re-eat sometime. I'm not usually a huge crepe fan, but consider me a fan of the Crepe Bar.",

The food is good, no question, but they have \"policies\" that you cannot substitute any of the ingredients in their crepes.  At first we were told that they have a policy against that because they have such a limited supply of each ingredient that if they substituted anything then they'd run out of ingredients for the other crepes.   However, when my girlfriend and I wanted to switch some ingredients between the crepes we ordered so that the careful balance of the evidently finite universe of crepe ingredients would not be disturbed, we were then told that they have another policy that you can't switch ANY ingredients at all, even on the same order. WTF?!? I must have missed the Michelin Star rating and James Beard award hanging on the wall of your dilapidated strip mall crepe bar. My apologies to the chef!  Oh, and their coffee is awful.",

Service: The staff here are exceedingly friendly and willing to help you understand any menu item. This is a sit-down type atmosphere, though you will have to order at the front. When you are waiting for the food (sometimes the wait might be a bit long) servers will bring out a delicious starting dish for you. Thus far I have gotten some various exquisite little pastries to munch on.  2. Sweet crepes: Hands down the best sweet crepes in the Valley. Thus far I have tried most of their crepes and coffees, and most of them have blown me away. I have a large sweet tooth so I would definitely recommend getting the sweet crepes, though (most) of the savory ones are delicious as well. The sweet crepes are soft and delicious, without being too sweet or flavorful. They are usually topped with sugar that makes just the right amount of crunch and satisfaction with every bite. I would highly recommend the lemon flavor.  3. Ambiance: The ambiance here is extremely calming. There is natural light streaming through their windows, and their chairs are painted with happy colors. They have funky art lining their walls as well, which serve as good amusement if you have are having an awkward conversation. The outside seating is really accessible as well. The only downfall would be the fact that the place is fairly small and the lines sometimes go out the door.  If you have an hour or two free on your schedule, definitely hit up the Crepe Bar- I doubt it will disappoint.",

The dessert crepe was phenomenal but the other 3 savory crepes were so salty that it was tough to eat. We managed to eat 2 because we didn't want to cause a fuss but left an entire crepe behind. When the girl came to pick up our plates, she didn't even bother asking why we hadn't eaten the other crepe. I guess we could've just told them straight up that the crepes were bad but we had a difficult time ordering in the first place with them unwilling to make any substitutions or let us order any sides that weren't listed specifically as a side on their menu.

I can understand that this place gets busy, but we saw people who walked in shortly after us with similar orders get there food at least 20 mins before us. After 30 mins of waiting, I went to ask if they had forgotten our food. They said it was about to come out, and we waited another 10 mins before the food came out. Eggs and crepe's were cold, burro was the only thing hot. Food overall was not as great as reviews that we had read, and the wait time just killed the experience completely. Will not be returning.",

They even gave me a flower for the ambulance ride.  I loved the food and the service before the incident occurred, now I can't thank the Crepe Bar enough.  Best restaurant ever.",

I ordered a vanilla bean custard crepe, which I've had with both the salted caramel and chocolate, and it was amazing! The portions are perfect for me, although some might think it may be too small (only because other establishments over feed you, anyway). I have brought many friends to indulge at the Crepe Bar with me, and have had the pleasure of trying the lemon drop, buckwheat and the papa K crepes; which all were very tasty in their own right.   I also love that they bring you samples of their desserts, granola, or bread at the beginning, and at times at the end, of your meal. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Being from a family in the restaurant business all my life, I'm quite particular about how service is handled, and they're on top of it! It's a fun, small, comfortable atmosphere as well. I've since become a regular. :)",

I ordered a nutella crepe for take out and after at least 35 minutes of waiting i finally got it. When i took my crepe out of the bag it was literally wrapped in a ball of tin foil. It was a crepe ball. On top of that they had NO plastic utensils even when asked. They are not at all prepared for take out. The food is great tasting but not something i would recommend for take out. Id say its a great place if you dont mind sitting in an extremely small and loud resteraunt, waiting half an hour for food. But yes, the crepes do taste quite good.",

The place is cozy and makes the best of what they have available in limited space, but the long line speaks for itself the great food they have to offer and they are soon expanding.   my best friend was in town from California, so along with my roommate (aka other bff) we decided to have a Sunday fun day before he's flight back home (anyone else watch You're The Worst on FXX?).  Never had a savory crepe before and got the vegetarian Buckwheat with egg, nice bit of spice with the horseradish havarti. If you're a hobbit who loves mushrooms get it. And their in house hot sauce is perfect blend of heat and tangy zest. They could profit selling it in  bottles.   My friends felt the wait staff had a certain air about them but concurred with food this delicious they deserve the attitude. They had that smoked turkey Crepe and breakfast burrito with chorizo.",

    "text": "Waiting for 2 weeks to meet a friend at Crepe Bar. Of course, read all the reviews on Yelp! Was a bit concerned about the size of the crepes after reading one review- really- the size of a business card? And, I do have a good appetite!!! Had pretty much made up my mind to try the Papa K as it pretty much had rave reviews.  Today came... and, geez... I was not disappointed!!! Love this place. Daughter lives in Portland, OR and I have never been to such cool and tasty restaurants as she has taken me to while visiting, Well, Crepe Bar could easily be in Portland and do GREAT business!!! Love the scene...decor is minimalist... which in someways was the only bittersweet part of the restaurant... by noon the crowd was coming, seemed the music picked up, so with the talk and music difficult to hear my friend as it seemed to echo through the room...but we managed. Small detail.  Service-as many other reviewers have said-was great. Young lady discussed the menu... after sitting down, we received a sweet small bowl of tender sweet potato potato chips... If they sold these I could eat a bag in one sitting. Delicious!!! A young man offered more coffee... And, toward the end of the meal, received two taste-size spoons of some sweet mixture topped with a slice of chocolate... Delicious!!!   We both ordered the Smokey... a delicious (how many times can I use this word for the Crepe Bar???) crepe with chorizo, turkey, avocado, and smoked Gouda. Did I say delicious? The combination needed no additional seasoning, and if the chef did, I could not tell. Truthfully, I have never eaten chorizo before, so I am now a convert... The flavors melded together. At times the smokey flavor of the Gouda would hit my taste palate reiterating the deliciousness of the Smokey. And, I was not disappointed by the size of the crepe...just enough. A small side of spring mix salad, with a light oil dressing accompanied the crepe and gave a just right change of texture when needed.  Can't wait to bring my husband here...or just return solo. Am hopeful the Crepe Bar makes it and remains in Tempe for a long time. Wish we had more of this variety of restaurant style and unique food in Tempe.",

    "text": "Been here twice, both times on Sunday and had no problem getting a table- service was very quick.  Came once at 10 am and once at noon.  The first time, my sister and I got 3 savory crepes to share as another review said portions were small.  I don't know what that person was talking about The crepes we ordered were huge and even though 1 each would've been more than enough, we ate Every last bit because everything was amazing.  Got the papa k, duck Cuban, and the one with turkey/Gouda.  I think duck Cuban was the best.  Went back today and was excited to try the Grand Prix but wasn't too crazy about it.  I love anything with pork belly but it was a little overcooked and pretty salty.  I think it needed some cheese or greens to even out the saltiness.  If I had gotten this the first time I went, I probably wouldn't have been back but my husband Loved the pork belly and had no complaints.  BUT due to the 3 other delicious crepes I tried previously, I still want to try more on their menu and I'm sure I will be back.  I love the cute little designs they make in the lattes which are very good as well.   Their drinks are pretty pricey though - I think it was $3 or $4 for a half a cup of iced tea which was super sweet and didn't really taste like Iced tea.   Best to stick with the free water unless you're getting coffee  Overall, really great breakfast place.  I'd give it a 3.5 if we could give half stars",

    "text": "Located off the beaten path in a non-descript Tempe strip mall off Rural Road- they are putting out some very flavorful and creative crepes here! I have yelp to thank for discovering this gem of a cafe! While visiting Chandler for my son's volleyball tournament, I needed to get something to eat. I wasn't sure if I wanted breakfast or lunch, but when I saw Crepe bar, and its nearly 5-star rating on yelp, my curiosity got the better of me...  Apparently, crepe bar got its start as a food truck. Being a former small business owner, I always root for the little guy, so I was happy for their success in opening the cafe. I decided to order the one item on their menu that they had at the original food truck, The Papa K. I got mine with added scrambled eggs, and was it ever delicious! Made with local ham- served fresh and warm with a mushroom ragout, pepper jack cheese, plus a side of field greens (with an olive oil dressing), and crunchy Parmesan cheese around the edges- it was fabulous!   The service here is extraordinarily friendly and efficient... They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and appreciated. In addition to hearty, main course type crepes, they also have sweet crepes, with names like sugar Brule, maple butter, vanilla bean custard, and the one everyone seems to rave about- first time Nutella. I thought the complimentary starter of house made granola was a nice gesture. Full espresso bar and drip coffee, along with teas and beer are offered to complement the excellent food. The vibe here is young and hip- with concrete floors, colorful walls, happy people, and semi-loud music. I would go back in a heartbeat, and look forward to trying the sweet crepes next time.",

Everything I've had is delicious, smokey, papa k, andouille, pork belly, dulce de leche scone, and a coffee sweet crepe. My favorite is the andouille, sooooo much flavor and it compliments the delicious coffee perfectly. The coffee is Heart coffee from Oregon and it's my new favorite. I was told Heart coffee is liked by beer drinkers because of its unique taste. Drink it black the first time you have it and if you prefer cream and/or sugar after trying it straight then go for it.  Finally, the ambiance is upbeat and energizing with a perfect mix of music, mostly oldies and classic rock. Hands down my favorite breakfast joint in AZ. Well done to the staff and owners!",

    "text": "Crepe Bar is a hidden southern Tempe secret that houses great food, affable service, and fantastic coffee. While it may be a smaller store that attracts hipsters like a sale on Pabst Blue ribbon, it's a wonderful place for a quick delicious lunch, and a satisfying cup of joe.  Before I talk about their namesake, let me first mention their coffee. I believe it's locally sourced, but wherever it's from it smells and tastes delicious. I love their cold brew for the sweeter flavor, but their latte's are excellent as well. Their coffee is always a nice pairing with anything else they serve.  I've sampled most of their \"Savory\" and \"Sweet\" menu and can't complain about anything. They have fresh and delicious ingredients and an ever changing menu that when paired with their expert understanding of ingredient ratio's creates a wonderfully balanced and sometimes surprising flavor. Their crepes are light as they should be, so expect a palate satisfying, not \"carb intoxicating\" experience. Despite what others on Yelp think, if you're complaining about a crepe being light, you might as well complain about soup being wet.  I don't have a lot of time off for lunch, but it's more than enough for a trip here. I've never felt that they've taken long with my order, despite the crowds, and the sample treats they bring to their customers always gives me a smile. I can't think of another pace that does this that doesn't also require a second mortage to eat at.  As for the reviews saying that it's too expensive or takes to long, please compare your experience at Crepe Bar to other similar restaurants. I mean, Essence bakery offers similar fare and they cost almost twice as much and always take much more time to prepare. I love Essence dearly; I'm just saying that good food takes time to prepare, make, plate, and serve. Twenty minutes for two crepes is nothing, and two meals out anywhere for less than $20 is an accomplishment. The only place faster and cheaper would be McDonalds, because even Ihop takes longer.  All in all, for a sweet & satisfying or perhaps a savory & satiating experience, check out Crepe Bar. Everything from their food, coffee, and service is wonderful, and as long as you have a well developed sense of reality, you'll have a great time.",

We got sweet and savory offering that were accompanied by a very fresh salad.  The coffee was delicious and the wait staff were very friendly and helpful.  I suppose the only negative was that we weren't sure there would be a table available.  I'm not sure how many the restaurant seats but it is rather small.  They have a few outside tables available but it would be nice if they could expand to an adjoining space.  The food was excellent and I highly recommend the business.",

When a friend suggested we get together for lunch at this restaurant, I begrudgingly accepted, thinking I'd end up with some small plate that would leave me hungry an hour or two later. I was incredibly wrong to cast any doubt on his recommendation. I got a turkey crepe that was both delicious and filling. In addition, we had the chance to try their vegan cereal which was just about one of the best cereals I have ever tasted (and as you can tell by the turkey crepe, I am not vegan). Even the iced tea was delicious and far, far above average.   If you question going out to eat crepes, stop right now. This restaurant is an amazing option for an area of town underserved by good restaurants. The staff is very attentive and, more importantly, friendly. I will most certainly go back and recommend you make a special trip even if it's out of your way. It is well worth it.",

I enjoy crepes a ton and I LOVE JoBot in downtown Phoenix, but this place... it just left so much to be desired.  I ordered a Papa K and my girlfriend ordered the veggie stack. Her crepe, no joke, was the size of a business card. I still remember how heartbroken she looked when the server (who was very friendly) placed it in front of her. She spent all morning trying to find a new crepe place on Yelp and was really stoked when she came across Crepe Bar. It would've been nice to have been able to add egg to her's, but I can see how for her particular crepe, it would interfere with other tastes. My crepe was larger than her's--more of a standard crepe size, but still pretty small compared the other crepes I've enjoyed in Arizona, Chicago, and parts of California (haven't had crepes overseas yet). Coffee was decent.  Now, we're not big fat gun totin' 'Merican eaters--we don't do all-you-can-eat type of stuff, we never \"biggie-size\" anything. But c'mon. We never, ever say that a meal was \"too small\". This meal was measly, even for a 105 pound girl.  Size aside, the crepes were gourmet. Both were. You can tell that time was taken when writing this menu and the chef delivers in all avenues of taste. All two bites were satisfying, but you don't have to make your dish the size of a Gameboy pocket to make it seem more like \"fine dining\" or to make it look like it is out of a magazine. I know that the world of fine dining and culinary arts pushes for quality over quantity (rightfully so), but even quality food should be sized and plated appropriately. You wouldn't serve someone a 1oz Kobe beef steak just because you spent so much time and energy perfecting it.  The search for a new crepe place continues...",

All the crepes and the coffee were great - the maple butter one being my favourite and with the most flavour. The prices ($3.50 - $5) were reasonable for the size and ingredients as well.  The only problem I had was with the slow service. The cashier was writing all the orders down by hand really slowly and I stood there while she wrote the last person's order for a couple of minutes without much acknowledgement from her or the many people working behind the counter. The crepes, something I have experience getting fairly quickly, took a pretty long time. My coffee was brought to my table without creamer or without being asked about cream and there was no cream at the self-serve bar - all of which I found odd. It was a good thing I had no where to be or I would have been pretty upset.   However, the taste of the crepes outweighs any time inconvenience I experienced this visit. All the crepes were exceptional and I might try to come back to sample the savoury offerings.",

The girls at the counter explained the menu, but they were unfortunately out of my first menu option. Had to modify my second choice, since they were out of apples. Oh well. We still came up with two options we were happy with. Ordered a tea, and took a seat outside.   The tea came after five-ish minutes. Chai with almond milk. SO good I had to order another. And then we waited. Silverware came out, and we waited some more. I almost wish I had looked at my watch when we ordered, because it felt like a good 25-30 minutes before we got our food. Normally it wouldn't have bothered me that much, since I was sipping my tea in the sunshine, but I had a 10 o'clock appointment, and I'm not a fan of hoovering my food.   Alas, hoovering was required, and both crepes were gone within three minutes of being on the table. What little I was able to taste while inhaling was pretty yummy.   I wouldn't mind giving them another shot, but this is definitely not the spot if you're not planning on a very leisurely meal.",

Definitely not a place to go to if you're thinking of stuffing your face lol servings are normal sized not super sized the way most of us Americans are use to eating nowadays. Their chai tea was pretty good, you get them in cute cups with designs in your tea or coffee, you know that thing that's super popular on Instagram right now.   Overall the food was great the drinks were great the environment was great, the only thing that made my experience bad was the head cook or manager (not sure what his position was) he was being extremely rude to the girl at the register. I'm not sure if she was new or not but the way he talked to her made a lot of people uncomfortable. You could tell she was embarrassed. He was complaining to her that she kept allowing people order the same thing and I guess they were running out. He could've handled the situation a lot different. Maybe take her to the back and speak in private? Not yell at her while theirs a line to the door of new customers. Won't be going back for that reason. People need to learn how to be kind to one another regardless of the area or situation.",

You can find them at all the festival and usually a cart every other block in the city center. So... I was a bit hesitant if I was going to like Crepe bar or not.  We went there for brunch on Sunday and ordered a savory crepe, sweet crepe, and one of their brioche breads with nutella and fig jam.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great everything tasted.  You can definitely taste the Crepe very well on the vanilla bean.  The brioche was also excellent, and I'll try to order that next time I'm in the restaurant.  The other bonus was ordering a scone to go.  It was fantastic and definitely beats out anything you'll ever find at Starbucks.  All in all the food was great, the restaurant had a nice hipster feel to it with some local artwork.  There was a nice mix of young, old, and families.  I will definitely be coming back.",

I also added chorizo to it. This crepe was sooooooo delicious! I do wish that it came with more avocado though. The chipotle sauce that it comes with was really good. I washed everything down with a chai tea that wasn't too shabby.   I really liked this place except there's a really long wait to get your food. I'm not sure if it's always like this but we waited about 30-35 minutes for our food. Maybe longer. I didn't know what to expect when I came here. I thought it was a full on restaurant. But it's not. You go to the front, get in line and order your dish. The place is really small so seating is also very limited. They should think about expanding the place. I'd come back to try out some more crepes though. =)",

The butter toast with cultured cream and jam was my favorite, great flavor combinations, different and a refreshing change. Out of the entrees our favorite was the Andouille crepe, tons of flavor, savory and satisfying.   If you are looking for a locally owned spot with inspired dishes, you should check out Crepe Bar.",

The space is cool, the food is delicious, the coffee comes from some legendary roaster out of Oregon (not sure that really matters, but the coffee is great!) all of the people that work there are friendly and take exceptional care of their guests. This morning I watched a customer walk up to the counter to ask what happened to the side of cream  he asked for (10 seconds earlier) The server politely replied that they were steaming his cream first so would make his coffee iced cold. Sometimes it's the little things.  The point is if you're thinking about opening a breakfast spot yourself, you should stop in to the crepe bar to see how its done. And also to have a delicious breakfast.   Thought about knocking a star off because they're closed on Mondays but I can't do it. It's too good a spot and besides, everybody needs a day off!",

It is super busy and noisy, and finding a table is difficult. So depends on what you are going for.  Probably due to the popularity, the staff was seriously looking overwhelmed when I was there. The barista was clearly doing the work of two people at once and getting zero thanks for it. The manager was berating his staff all around even as they were moving at breakneck pace, though he did some leading by example so I'll give him that. With the kind of business they're getting I hope they increase the staff!",

We shared the breakfast burrito crepe and the vanilla bean crepe with strawberries and walnuts. The breakfast burrito crepe was delicious, it was spicy, salty, bacon -y, and all around awesome. The only thing I think is a little funny is that it doesn't really need the crepe (I know, blasphemy!), The eggs on their own would have bean equally as delicious. The sauces were wonderful as well. The sweet crepe was also very tasty, but definitely did not hold up to the other. It was much smaller than the breakfast burrito, but it had a subtly sweet flavor....it didn't hit you in the face with the sweetness, I think because of the buckwheat crepe maybe. Anyway, I would definitely return for breakfast! So why only 4 stars? The coffee.....the coffee was really acidic and I didn't love it so much....I was glad it was free with my Yelp check in (thanks Yelp!).",

We used to visit the Crepe Truck at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market, so we knew the crepes would be good. For whatever reason, we didn't go back for quite a while (probably more because we are creatures of habit and usually go to the Good Egg when we go out for breakfast.) We went back recently with 2 friends and were blown away! Everything is delicious, and the presentation of the crepes now is so beautiful and artistic. My husband and I shared a lemon drop and a smoked turkey. The lemon drop was beautiful,  it was wrapped to look like a flower; the flavor was wonderful, perfect combination of sweet and tart. The smoked turkey was incredible -smoky and savory and completely addictive.  I wanted to lick the plate! It came with a nice little side salad as well. We also got two complimentary treats. Before our meal, we were given a small bowl of marcona almonds with rosemary, and after we ate, we were given sea salt chocolates -both were lovely and nice touches. The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the house coffee- I thought it was really acidic, but that's just my taste. Next time, I'll probably get an espresso drink. I can't believe this place is in south Tempe, it would fit in perfectly in Scottsdale or Phoenix. I am so happy to live just a few minutes away from it. Can't wait to go back!",

The owners need to rethink how diners are seated and served, what worked originally no longer works. You stand in line to place your order, you stand in line for a table, and then can wait as long as an hour for your food. I've also seen some folks rudely place keys or coats on tables then get in line to place orders, and then watch others balance their plates and stand & eat while they are just sitting there waiting for their food - the staff should have more control of the flow. The owners need to do something similar to the Farmhouse in Gilbert where folks signin upon arriving so that tables are flowing along with the meals.",

    "text": "First. Aside from the niche cuisine genre, I would venture to say there are few who care more about their craft in Tempe (and dare I say greater Phoenix) than the folks at Crepe Bar. They care more about their food and community than I've seen elsewhere. It's remarkable.  Second, if you've ever watched Andrew Zimmern do that thing where he takes a bite of food, closes his eyes, has a little moment, and nods in agreement with the deliciousness of the morsel he just savored...   This is that sort of experience.   If you've never had a savory crepe (and I would guess there are quite a few of you out there), you'll never forget the first bite of a savory Crepe Bar crepe. It's masterful, and I can *barely* wrap my head around it. This is, by my knowledge, one of the only spots in town you can get premium cuts and preparations of duck, pork, chicken, etc. for a reasonable price, in a nearly anti-grandiose setting.  Highly recommended. Also, Coffee is a must.  Pros: other-wordly food, presentation, service, and fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. Craft. And coffee.  Cons: they're SUPER anti-substitution / omission / addition (which hasn't really ever been an issue for me, personally, but I've heard a few gripes from friends). Craft! They often get terribly crowded around brunch and throughout the morning / mid-day, and seating becomes a real issue because of the size of their space, availability of tables and chairs. I can't knock them for being popular.  Bonus: Oftentimes, complimentary miniature samples of their desserts and sides are delivered to your table mid-way through your meal. The first time I visited, this sample was a house-made rose infused marshmallow cube (brulee'd... at the table.) atop a shard of miso dark chocolate. Divine. Also, some of the staff at Crepe Bar (who knows- maybe *all* of them) are well in-sync with current craft coffee culture and trends. Crepe Bar is one of the only places in town where whole coffee beans from Heart Roasters (Portland) are available, as well as beans from the late local Phoenician roasters Nom de Plume (RIP).",

I'm usually standing by the door when they open for business and usually there are others waiting. Don't go when you are in a hurry ... Go and bring a friend or two ... Enjoy the flavors and relax!   There really is nothing bad on the menu but don't be afraid to ask questions! The staff are so friendly and super helpful! My personal favorite is the Vanilla Bean Crepe with Strawberries (I usually order 2 for myself) and a drip coffee. You won't go wrong with this combo! I promise :-)   If you are really good ... You might even happen upon their CB cereal to munch on before your food arrives or a delicious surprise to finish your meal. I love it when they bring by little samples of their other menu items. It's the extra attention to detail that keeps me coming back!  Great job CB! Thanks for making delicious food :-)",

They took the French recipe for crepe bars and recreated it here.  Very good selection of different crepes too (savory and sweet).  Love it.  The staff was excellent and helpful.  The whole place has a very hip vibe to it.  Great for the 20-30 somethings (I'm much older btw, but still loved the vibe).  Note that this is a \"stand in line to order then sit down and wait for the food\" place, so don't expect to be waited on (although they do deliver your food).  Anyway, I highly recommend if you love crepes and real expresso.  If you are an Eggo and Folgers person, then maybe you won't get it.  If you have never had real French crepes, I think this is the closest you'll get without going to France.  So much better than the American standard interpretation of a crepe..",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Crepe Bar because I LOVE crepes. LOVE crepes.  And Crepe Bar does make a nice, thin, authentic crepe - which I prefer.  I ordered the breakfast burrito sans bacon. The crepe itself was delicious - nay, perfect. The contents, however, were nearly inedible. The inside contents were so oversalted I wondered what it would taste like with salty bacon inside, as it is normally served. Blech. I don't know if it was their salsa that was too salty... Or the eggs.  Perhaps it was both. My lips are still dry from all that salt.  I don't know if someone forgot they had salted it and then salted it again, but it was just yuck.  This is a perfectly fine place to come for a dessert crepe. I tried a few bites of the Nutella crepe and thought it was delicious, mainly due to the caramelized sugar and bananas.  I am not a fan of Nutella because it is too sweet for me, but the crepe was really good.    One other positive?  Kids under 12 get perfectly portioned versions of the crepes for 1/2 price.  My daughter took advantage of this fantastic deal and ordered herself a simple crepe with caramelized sugar.  I snagged a bite of it and it was uber-yummy.  The space was very bare and I feel it could have about four or five more tables without feeling cramped.  There was art on the walls, but I didn't get a sense anyone helped the restaurateurs with their decor.  It did not seem minimalist on purpose.  It just seemed like they found some cool light fixtures they liked and threw some tables in there.  I KNOW it used to be operated out of a food truck; Now that it is a restaurant, I feel it could use some more thought.  Finally, and I know it is kind of gross to mention, there were two hair incidents here today.  First, there was a curly black hair that I noticed to the left of my plate almost immediately after it was set down in front of me.  Second, there was a blondish/white hair stuck to my daughter's caramelized fruit garnish (lemon or orange?).  I don't let these things get to me since I know they can happen anywhere, but I had to mention it since it wasn't just one.  I am not too concerned about the conditions in this restaurant.  It was otherwise very clean.  I just had to mention it.  In sum, I may come here again for a dessert crepe, but I will avoid the savory ones.  P.S. One pet peeve of mine?  They don't have regular soda brands.  I don't mind it when places carry only the Mexican Coke in bottles.  Kinda cool, retro thing going on there.  Crepe Bar only has GUS cola and, as a cola drinker, I found it gross.  It still had 24g of sugar, but it tasted like a diet.  If you're going to have cola soda at all, please consider carrying even a few bottles of Coke!",

This cute little place trumps all coffee shops so far mainly because of their customer service. I can't even remember being treated so well as a customer. I wish I got her name, but one of the ladies brought us a few sample goodies while we waited for my sisters Breakfast Burro (which was so fricken amazing I.just.can't.).   My sister enjoyed her latte, I enjoyed my coffee, I enjoyed their playlist, & I enjoyed the calm but not library like atmosphere. Plus free wifi? Holla. Definitely will be a regular spot.  OH. & first place with free, that's right, FREE, coffee refills. Pure win for an avid coffee drinker like myself.",

That's not a bad thing; I've had great food from trucks. Just be aware of that I'd you're expecting a fancy bistro-ish ambiance.  The menu is pretty simple: Savory vs. Sweet crepes, coffee/tea drinks, and a few other offerings. There are kids sizesI haven't had the coffee yet, but the iced chai wasn't bad at all.  I've only been here a couple of times, but I have yet to be disappointed and will most definitely be back to try the 'Sweet' side of the menu.",

    "text": "My review play by play style:   Came in and was greeted by the staff. Started looking at the menu and decided on a Papa K (spinach, mushroom, ham, pepper jack) and an iced mocha. Paying using Square Pay on the iPad being used as a register is awesome, screw the credit card companies.   As I sit here waiting for my crepe I can only think that if the food is as awesome as the service my mouth is in for a treat. Everybody is helpful, friendly and enthusiastic. The owner is out talking to everyone and letting us know he appreciates us coming in, something I love seeing business owners do.  For my mocha pretty quick and it is really good. I am not a huge coffee fan and don't order them often but this one is good. Maybe it's a bit extra chocolate making me happy but it works. Not to mention its not all ice like Starbucks is.   Holy flavor explosion in my mouth that is tasty. Just got the crepe (maybe 5 minutes wait if that) and took a bite. That is great. I got a first bite full of flavor and the edge of the crepe with a little but of just crispy cheese oozing out. This thing is also a big crepe and stuffed to the max. All the flavors go great and the pepper jack is spicy but not over powering the spinach and mushroom.   The flavors work very well together and it's  fantastic. The crepe itself is just right and takes me back to being in Paris. The crepe is the right density to be filling but not heavy, and light but still be filling.  The density is the biggest problem I have seen with crepes outside of France.   This thing is packed full and filling me up quick. My stomach is saying stop but my taste buds and brain are screaming for another bite. The saltiness of the ham is addictive with smoky flavor.   Ok finished the crepe and totally filled, amazing considering how hungry I was. Pretty quickly the staff sees I am done and  clears the table for me while I finish mocha and this review.   Final thoughts this place is great and I cant wait to come back and try the other crepes. Oh crap I see a strawberry topped one next to me, I need to get out of here before I order a desert.",

    "text": "I discovered this gem in the East Valley by chance. I simply noticed a new sign had gone up in a neighborhood near my home that I was interested in exploring more. They hadn't actually opened yet, but I was able to find out about their soft opening after some on-line research, and dragged a roommate to the venue. This didn't give us a complete understanding of how wonderful their menu is, but we were able to sample some delicious free bites that inspired us to come back again. This was also the first time that I had been served anything in a disposable pipet, which indicated to me that the owners might be attuned to the finer details of a good dining experience.  And that's what the Crepe Bar is all about... subtle but deliberate choices on delivering a delicious meal. The crepes are perfect! There is so much more finesse and nuance to a breakfast burrito that is served wrapped in a crepe than you can imagine. They also provide a small pile of gourmet salt on the plate so that you can apply just the right  sprinkle. I urge you to try this place for breakfast sometime and see how it stacks up to your other favorites. What I like best is that the portions are not overwhelming but satisfying, the finesse and attention paid to fresh ingredients and flavors is spot-on, and it has the feel of a casual coffee shop... but with food that is truly exceptional!",

Took an hour and fifteen minutes to get food. Complained after 45 minutes and they said they'll bring out some complimentary appetizers. The complimentary appetizers were brought out by a young guy who called himself a chef. He explained his experimental apps- torched cocoa powder. It was a dish. With cocoa powder on it. That he pointed a torch at. At first I thought he was making a joke, and then I felt a little insulted. Another half hour later, and our food came out. Which was edible at least.

His burro crepe was wonderful and my Grand Prix crepe may have been the best thing I have ever had for breakfast.

    "text": "Hmm.  Just made my 6th visit to this place in the last couple months.  Needless to say, I am a fan.  The coffee and crepes are excellent - the savory turkey is a favorite.  The house made granola is killer.  They amped up the ambience recently by adding art work which makes for a nice, homey feel.  Prices are absolutely reasonable.    However, they appear to be suffering from some growing pains.  My husband and I visited last Saturday and waited 45 mins (!!) for our meal.  By the time our order came our coffee had grown cold.  When I asked for a refill I was told I'd need to get it myself (\"because if I go get it, they'll charge you\".)  I also ordered a bag of granola at the counter and had to remind the cashier twice before I finally received it.  The food was good, as usual, but overall the visit was frustrating.  Even the staff seemed confused.    My suggestions to the owners are simple.  Figure out your service model.  If you're offering counter service, then develop a system that lets me know when my food is ready.  An even better idea would be to hire wait staff.  I'd rather drink hot coffee with my meal and eat my desert crepe after I've completed my entree.  I'd also suggest losing the t-shirt rack near the front door.  None of the shirts said Crepe Bar (?) so it was hard to figure out what the point was.    I'll definitely be back, hoping for the best.  Good luck to the owners as they continue to work the kinks out.  UPDATE:  Last 3-4 visits were flawless so I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  Go Crepe Bar!",

We've had the maple butter (sweet but SO delicious) the Papa K (savory and amazing) and the Jamaican Jerk (FAVORITE savory one). The flavors are all delicious and wonderfully paired. We've also had the vanilla latte and the mimosas. Both are also delicious.  This place is definitely worth going to! We love it here!",

The breakfast burrito was very flavorful without being too heavy, even with the mayo sauce. I actually really liked the crepe as a substitute for tortilla; it's a lot chewier and moist without being soggy. I gotta try their sweet crepes next!  The service was outstanding as well. I was apprehensive about the staff being snobby hipsters, especially since it was only 45 min till closing time when we got there. To my surprise, they were super friendly. Actually some of the patrons didn't get their food until almost 2pm, but I didn't feel like the staff was rushing them to finish.",

Savory goodness!- so I walked in...  When I entered this restaurant/cafe, it was a different story. Every wall is decorated with a local painter's touch (most likely) and every server I encountered had the biggest smile on her/his face.  AND I had the honor of meeting the Chef Jeff who made delicious dishes that filled me up just right.   Don't forget to try the following: - FREE drip coffee if you check in with Yelp (what a deal!) - Pork Belly dish (forgot the name but ask for it!) with coffee infused crepes!  - Hot chocolate that smells like rose and has a melting marshmallow on top (heaven!) = Chef Jeff's newest creation - AND the maple butter crepe that's so simple that it's perfect.  This was my last meal in Phoenix and I couldn't have had a better meal.  THANK YOU to all the staff members I met today; it was truly a miracle that such a lovely gem was the last place I got to go to on my last day in Phoenix!",

Very welcoming staff that also brought me a little free extra: a housemade scone and I don't like scones, but LOVED this one. Was bacon and blue cheese and mild, not overpowering flavors. Very well done, thank you, I'll be back!",

Instead of your standard tortilla they use a chipotle crepe. And it's only $8($6.75 w/o chorizo), you can't really beat that.   For dessert I went with the \"First Time,\" which is a banana and Nutella brulee crepe, it was perfect. Not too sweet, just right. There's not much room for error when it comes to bananas and Nutella.   Overall it was a great place, highly recommend it.

I seriously consider myself a sweet crepe lover, and lover of anything Nutella, and this crepe will blow your mind!  Papa K is delicious if you are looking for a savory crepe, as well as the Breakfast Burrito. I have yet to have something unsatisfying there, and I truly think it's impossible.  Oh, and the latte art! So cute. Not only do you get to enjoy delicious hand crafted love in a cup, it looks cute too.   And lastly, the friendly staff are always walking around with snacks for you to munch on while you wait for your food, whether it's their house-made granola, or sage tea bread, it's all so good!

From the time my guest and I arrived (11am) we were greeted (with a smile) while in line - which was shorter than I expected for a Saturday morning and given a menu to look over while we waited.   At the register the girl asked us if we had any questions about anything on the menu, which we didn't and we proceeded to order - I ordered the breakfast burro crepe and a vanilla custard crepe for after and my guest had the basil chicken and maple butter crepe. Both options were absolutely amazing I would post a pic but I didn't take one before I had the chance to bite into it.  While seated we were given a sample of granola which was also excellent and we also ordered 2 chai teas..the entire meal came to a total of $42 which for the service, fresh offerings and atmosphere I would gladly pay again. The Grand Prix was sold out but I'm determined to try that my next trip out.  If you haven't been here you must bookmark this spot as your go to for a light breakfast/lunch.",

Be ready to meet some of the nicest servers in the valley 2.  Grand Prix - order it early before they run out 3.  If they do run out you can resort to the Maple crepe and add the pork jowl (similar but not. the. same) 4.  Coffee - just... Yes... To all of it.  5.  Go during the week to avoid the crowds 6.  Or go during the weekend to get your fix of \"Yum\" and a lively atmosphere",

I have yet to try something here that I don't like, and I would venture to say I've at least sampled 80% of the menu.  The maple butter banana brulee blows my freakin' mind every time. The appetizers here are also a mind explosion - they have these smoked sweet potatoes that taste like a campfire in the most delicious way possible.

I've had crepes all over the world and this place definitely makes you feel like you're in France w out having to worry about speaking french! ;p Their recipes are unique and delicious. My absolute favorite is the rose marshmallow hazelnut crepe. Definitely not like anything else out there. It's a mix between Turkish delights, s'mores w Nutella infusion",

The tahini crepe with chicken (savory). Both were really delicious! Had a tough time choosing a savory crepe, the other good choice according to reviewers is the paprika chicken crepe. The paprika crepe is for those who prefer more seasoning and the tahini crepe is for those who enjoy hummus and creamy flavors. The vanilla crepe has the perfect balance of sweetness and can only be described as perfection. Love this place and would have breakfast here every week if I could! We also ordered a vanilla and seasalt caramel latte which were okay, 3/5. The coffee roast didn't have much flavor, and didn't awaken the senses. The crepes are the real stars here!",

I don't understand why crepes have not taken off as a thing around here, but I am sure glad this chef decided to give it a go in South Tempe. The staff is super friendly, but today they truly went out of their way. We were celebrating Father's Day with my octogenarian parents, and the restaurant was packed (as it is often on Sundays). Only high-top tables were available which were not suitable for Mom and her walker.  I asked if they could help us out when a regular table came available, and they were quick to place a reserved sign on one close to being available.  The staff checked on us a few times too. Thanks for the great service.",

Since then we have been there six more times together and she has went with her mom and daughter a few additional times. She loves the strawberry/banana crepe, but I have turned her more toward the savory. The Grand Prix is a definite winner with a great piece of pork belly. I also have ordered the Jamaican Jerk Pork multiple times. The latte is wonderful, and she loves the selection of tea. The restaurant used to be very crowded and it was difficult to find seating, but they have expanded and solved that as best as possible. There is also the option to sit outside. Two savory crepes, a latte, and tea will come in around $26, but it is well worth it.",

    "text": "A delicious update! I haven't been here since they expanded their space and changed up the menu a bit so we decided to try out Crepe Bar for breakfast today. We got here a few minutes after opening (9 AM on Sunday) and there was already a line 5-6 people deep to order! That gave us time to decide what to get at least. There is a good variety of savory and sweet crepes, various coffee and tea beverages, and a small selection of non crepe items. I had the octopus crepe, tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe, and shared the dulce de leche crepe to finish our meal.   While we were waiting for our order the server brought out a small plate of chicharron with dipping sauce. It was a great way to pique our appetite and had a lovely presentation. Our entrees looked even more beautiful, with a well balanced presentation and mix of colors. My octopus crepe was served on 3 small crepes open faced. Because the crepes were thin, and the filling plentiful but crumbly it was hard to get a good bite of filling with crepe. I loved the presentation but I think having a more traditional folded up crepe would make it easier to eat the dish. In general the octopus was tender and flavorful but was slightly chewier than the amazing octopus dish at Virtu and Nico's Heirloom Kitchen. The chorizo in the dish was decent, but after a while I was wishing there were a slightly sweet element in the dish to balance out all the salty flavors. Perhaps a small squeeze of orange would help brighten up the dish.  I tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe which had a lovely balance of flavors and textures. The chickpeas were a wonderful surprise as they were dehydrated so they tasted crispy and light.  Our dulce de leche crepe for dessert was amazing. The fresh slices of creamy banana went well with the soft crepe, lightly sweet sauce, and crunchy candied pepitas. I would definitely order this again (And again, and again)!  I ordered a Moroccan spiced almond milk latte, which had a subtle hint of exotic spice with a light flavor of honey. It was a well balanced drink. Note that the hot drinks (At least with my latte) are served in a cup that has no handle. My hands got a bit sticky since some of the coffee and milk spilled off the side and I had to grip the cup with both my hands to drink it (First world problems, right?).   Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. I will definitely come back again! Upgrade one star.",

I did not read too many reviews because I did not want to be influenced. The one review I did read mentioned the rude kitchen lead and I am guessing that was the same person I said under my breath was a terrible person.  I don't know but almost thinking he maybe the owner?  Seems to me when they remodeled they should have made the kitchen bigger and more feng shui. I also feel like there is a lot of wasted space. They were not busy when I went on Sunday at 9:30am but if they are as busy as it sounds there could be so much more seating. I was watching the kitchen staff and perhaps they need training and a sense of \"team\" to be more effective. Especially since they are visible to the public.  Overall vibe was not rewarding. Did not feel any different from when I walked in.   The food, eh not impressed. I ate it (3 stars) but pretty sure will never have a craving. Maybe they should visit La Creperie in Fort Collins, CO. That I enjoyed.   And no substitutions, you may delete but not add.   Good Luck",

    "text": "I have been here quite a few times and, while the service has never been good, this last visit on the morning of Friday July 27th really showed how poorly the staff at Crepe Bar is trained. A group of friends and I came to this restaurant and grabbed the only open table that would seat all five of us. We all order food and are halfway through eating when an employee comes by and places two cards on our table without saying a word. After he walks away, we take a look at the cards and see that they say \"Reserved\". A few minutes later, he comes back and says that they have a group coming in and basically asks us to leave so that they could have our table. There was nothing that indicated that the table was reserved before we sat down and we had only been there for about 40 minutes before he asked us to leave. We decided not to get up as we were nowhere near finished, and about 10 minutes later, the large party came in. It appeared to be a bachelorette party or something similar and for some reason they had a clothesline with a bunch of pairs of underwear on the table, which was a bit off putting to see in a restaurant.   Overall, this was just a ridiculous experience. If a table is reserved, perhaps it would be wise to say so before a group of customers sits down and gets their food. Also, this same employee rather aggressively said to us \"You didn't eat the granola that I brought you?\" Which might have been a joke, but was said in a rather rude tone and made us all uncomfortable. Don't come to this restaurant if you care about good service. And the drinks are tiny and expensive and the iced tea does not have refills.",

The staff was very helpful, they asked me if I had ever been here before and explained to me how the process works. You order at the front and pick any table that you want. They bring the food to you.  I ordered the \"Say Cheese\" Savory Crepe which is a savory crepe filled with scrabbled eggs and cheese. You have an option of choosing a cheese and it comes with a small side salad with a vinaigrette dressing. Overall the crepe was delicious, simple, cheese had a great flavor and combined with the salad it's great! The chocolate scone was amazing. Not too sweet, which I like. The chocolate drizzle on top made it even better.",

It's an order at the front first type of place FYI. It's cute inside & surprisingly bigger than it appears. I ordered the Papa K crepe & it was pretty good. Not the best crepe I've ever had, but tasty & satisfying. The highlight was definitely the honey latte though! I have a thing for more uniquely flavored lattes. The service is very laid back & casual. If you need anything, expect to grab it yourself. Overall it was a good experience.

Definitely grab a few bites with the berry, crepe, pistachio and caramel! It is DIVINE!! The latte was great too; it had a very unique flavor that compliments the crepe very well.

The atmosphere of the place is very cool and hip and all of the workers are very friendly. They always bring out a little appetizer while you are waiting for your meal as the waits here tend to be pretty long. Don't come here expecting a quick and fast meal as they are always busy and it usually take 15-20 minutes for your crepes to come out.   Never the less the crepes are delicious and they always come out fantastically presented. One thing that does bother me is that they don't do substitutions on the crepes, ex) I can't substitute strawberries for bananas on the Nutella crepe.  I highly recommend the breakfast burro crepe and then the vanilla bean and strawberry crepe for dessert. And of course don't forget to try their coffee, its always made fresh to order and they use super high quality coffee beans, the coffee always turns out fantastic.",

While waiting for our orders, we received a sample of the CB cereal and farro pudding.  The cereal was more than just your typical cereal (some nuts and dried fruits - check out the pics).  The pudding was a cool refreshing treat that I'll have to try more of.  Then the crepes came out.  We tried the chicken pesto and the smokey crepe.  Both offer such great flavors of savoriness.  The dessert crepe was the Pick Me Up Crepe - if you love your share of coffee, this one is definitely for you (packed with espresso marscapone and hazelnut goodness).  I cannot wait to try the other items!",

You can expect a small line and few free tables, but that's just another sign its worth the wait. We were helped even when waiting in line by the friendly staff who gave us some awesome suggestions. We ordered the strawberry vanilla crepe and the toast with avocado spread egg, and sprouts. It was easy to tell the ingredients were of the highest, freshest quality. I also drank my coffee black, which I don't normally do, because it was just that good. While we were waiting, one of the employees brought us out a taste of their granola (easily the best I'd ever had and I'm really regretting not buying a bag!), a bowl of their perfectly crispy kale chips, and two sea-salt mint chocolates after our meal. The atmosphere was charming - a very local feel and truly a hidden gem. I was also able to bring my dog, although we had to wait a bit for one of the outside tables (I wish they had a few more).   Can't wait to come back here.",

The new space is great but they completely changed their menu and got rid of a bunch of their amazing crepes. I am not a huge fan of the new menu and I very nicely asked if they could change out the cheese in my crepe to a less spicy option (not everyone likes spicy). Not only did the manager refuse to grant my request, she basically lectured me about how if they changed out my cheese they would run out by the end of the day. This was on a Wednesday and the place was less than half full. After asking again nicely she still refused. It soured my whole visit and I am not sure when I will be back. Really, really bummed about the changes here.",

But the Staff was super friendly and answered questions and offered  their suggestions when we couldn't decide in which dessert crepe we were gonna have.    I enjoyed the breakfast burrito with no bacon and a vanilla bean crepe w strawberries.  One of the friends I was with got the breakfast burrito with bacon. It had a white bacon powder on it that was a mystery fluff to us before we asked. Apparently is has a subtle bacon flavor. Either way; the idea was creative and original but may have fallen short of its potential.   Before entries came out they brought dehydrated kale chips and a gummy candy treat. It was perfect! After we finished those they brought out a granola mix; which was a little sweet for my palate, but still enjoyable.   The complimentary treats were much appreciated!   Overall vibe of the place is pretty chill with attractive art work.",

There are people waiting by the cash register for their to go coffee and it feels congested. But that's the only downside of this neat place.   When I sat down at the table to wait for my meal I was given a tiny bowl of homemade granola that was a salty and sweet  and the perfect tapas to nibble on before my mushroom Ragu crep was delivered. My crep came out quickly and it was delicious! There was a little serving of beautifully seasoned sea salt on the side of the plate which parred perfectly with the crep.   At the end of the meal I was served a dessert tapas of homemade rose scented marshmallows that are toasted at the table by the server and drizzled with dark chocolate. To die for.   I will definitely be going back! I can't wait to try everything on the menu!",

Today, we had the breakfast burro. The eggs were perfectly fluffy and there was just enough chorizo and bacon to satisfy my savory buds. The iced Carmel latte is so good! It was almost buttery. We finished off with a sweet crepe, vanilla cream with strawberries, chocolate pistachios, and espresso chocolate syrup. Amazing.  The staff really care about their customers. Not only are they friendly but they have also taken CPR courses to ensure the safety of their customers and employees. A customer needed attention of the EMTs and the staff assisted with keeping customers calm and comfortable while help was on its way.  Apparently another incident happened before and they were quick to certify their staff. I'm impressed with them for taking the initiative to have their staff trained.",

I love the latte art - always seems to make the drink taste even better.  Speaking of which, the food arrangements are always spectacular, which adds to the gourmet feel of the place.

Try not to get too addicted, but it's definitely great for a special occasion.",

My coffee was not made correctly but the staff was quick to offer a replacement. The atmosphere and design need a bit of attention, as I think that they are going for modern/artsy, but it comes across as a bit stark. While eating such a comfort food as crepes, I wanted more of a comfortable and welcoming surrounding, I think couches and books would be a nice touch. I would give a four star had the coffee been a bit better. I do recommend for an early morning sweet tooth!",

For crepes you have the choice of 'savory' or 'sweet.' My wife and I both ordered savory and loved our choices.  The menu is reasonably priced - about $4-$5 for sweet and $7 for savory. For two savory crepes and two drinks our bill was $20 and change.  We will definitely be back to eat our way through the menu!",

It was like shaved sweet potato that was deep fried and dosed with salt and pepper. It was pretty greasy and looked like they had been in the fryer for a few minutes too long. The breakfast burrito likewise looked saturated with oil like it had been deep fried. I ordered the honey crepe and it was burnt. The crepe itself was relatively thick and the nuts were also burnt. I don't know if they recently got a new chef but I think you can see a trend in the food we got. Their iced tea was really good though! As an added plus, you get free refills on the iced tea.",

It easily secured the needs of the meal with the sweet but detailed nuances of the caramelized banana and strawberry.

    "text": "So, working right down the street from this place I've been eyeballing it for weeks, waiting for a good time to strike...  Well, that time finally came and I stopped in here for a pre-holiday lunch just a few weeks ago.  I have to brag on them, the food is utterly delicious!  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken crepe for lunch, and a First Timer (Nutella with bananas) crepe for dessert.    (Yes, dessert with lunch.  It was almost Christmas and I was treating myself...  Don't judge!)    Firstly, let me say that the buffalo chicken crepe was light and airy while the chicken was spicy and savory.  It was complemented by julienned carrots and crumbled blue cheese, which perfected it.  The First Timer dessert crepe was like a warm hazelnut and chocolate banana party wrapped in a pillowy soft crepe; amazingly good.  Second, while it all tasted fabulous, the food *was* a bit on the high price for a lunch entree, especially considering that the crepes don't come with any kind of side so really all you get for your money is a delicious crepe.  Also it was a little bit slow in coming out, but still so yummy that I'll easily forgive the wait.  (Plus, as another reviewer perfectly stated, \"It's not as though they are looking to dethrone McDonald's\" so keep that in mind when you are waiting for your food...  Quality takes time, right?)  I edited this to add that as far as pricing goes a miniature, mixed green salad served as a side with the savory crepes (with a simple lemon and olive oil dressing) would easily make me feel the value for the price had been leveled out and would cost very little to provide.    I don't know if my waistline or my wallet can handle visiting the Crepe Bar too frequently, but I'll definitely make it a point to come by as often as the diet and the budget will allow it!",

It's nice that they have a few tables indoors as well as outdoors (although, during the Summer months they probably won't get used much).  We approached the counter and the girl who helped us was very nice and made suggestions to help us decide on what to order.  We each ordered a savory crepe and a sweet crepe.  All of the crepes were really good; my lemon dessert crepe was especially satisfying.  My savory crepe was delicious too - it was a chicken crepe and the edge of it had crispy cheese all around which was a nice touch.  The crepes themselves are perfect.  My one complaint about Crepe Bar is the drink selection.  They have an espresso bar, but, beyond that, your choices are craft root beer (which I have no problem with) or water from a jug on the counter.  There is no soda fountain and no bottled water.  I understand if you don't want to pay licensing to have a soda fountain or, maybe you just don't want soda, that's fine too, but having bottled water in Arizona is a pretty standard option.  The luke warm, non-iced jug on the counter is just not what we were looking for.  Crepe bar was definitely a nice place and I will go back there for sure (my wife has already been back so I'm a little jealous).  But, when we go back, we will take our own bottles of water with us... and we'll buy a root beer too.",

After reading the yelp reviews, I decided to try the smoked turkey savory crepe and the buttered toast.  The toast was fine, and the highlight of the meal was the cultured cream and fruit compote that came with it. The fact that the crepes weren't the highlight is one of the reasons why this place only gets 3 stars. The crepes were ok, but nothing amazing. Mine had chorizo which was overcooked and salty, but the smoked gouda was a nice flavor with everything else. Overall, meh.  The other reason this place gets 3 stars is the service. The people were nice, but it took almost 30 minutes to get our food, and we were after the lunch rush. There was certainly enough staff, but they were terribly inefficient. And if I'm waiting that long for food, it should be amazing. Plus we both had water with lunch, and they brought a chilled bottle for us to split, nice gesture, but it was at the end of our meal. Another miss.   All in all, I was underwhelmed. I won't go out of my way to go back.",

    "text": "Why I'm done with Crepe Bar:  Coming here in general, I expect a wait.  A wait for tables, a wait to order, and at least an hour wait for my food.  Which should say, either how popular this place is, or how unprepared they are to handle demand.  Prior to today, I would have said the former (which is why we've waited outside for them to open before just to get faster service, etc.).  After today's experience, I am going with the latter.    I understand that a crepe is not a quick prepare meal.  And we were briefly warned that they were running \"a bit behind today\".  And finally, in their defense, we came in an hour before they close.  So, I shouldn't have been upset that they were out of basic items like mushrooms.  But, it was disappointing.  After waiting the standard hour for food, I did start becoming a bit antsy.  And the blood sugar started dropping as we watched table after table receive their food, including a couple that came in after us (this despite the fact that we had been assured our food was next).  So, finally, our crepes started seeping in, one to two at a time.  I had ordered a turkey with gouda and vegetables.  That's what the waiter said he had, so I took my crepe, announced to my friends that selfishly I would be eating because I did have somewhere to be afterwards and would need to take off shortly.  As I was eating, I noticed that it was actually a crepe of eggs and ham.  Nothing at all like I had ordered, but it was the order of one of the other girls.  I drew the server's attention to the mislabel and that I had already eaten 1/4 of it.  Ironically he was serving the table with a ham and egg crepe, which was her order again.  So, we received 2 of her orders, but none of my.  I told him that I was in a hurry and needed mine to go because of the EXCESSIVE wait.  And we were still missing one girl's food.    He told me that he was embarrassed and that the wait was excessive, mostly due to a lack of preparedness in the kitchen area and that they would get my meal to go. Finally, the last girl received her food, that was, SHOCKINGLY, missing some of the ingredients, especially guacamole, that it was supposed to have. Another mis-made crepe from our order, that would have to be a correction after she had was almost done with her meal.  As my To-Go crepe was arriving (which I have to give some credit for the speed that they showed crepes COULD come out, although apparently no one offered to refund anyone for slow speed, mis-orders, or general poor service, or to bring us a granola sample like we've had in the past) they were bringing little \"brownie bites\" that at this point, felt like a small bribe for the awful service, prolonged wait, and mis-made crepes.    I took my To-Go bag and as I was driving away, I noticed, that although all meals come with the standard salad, mine did not have this in the bag, just a crepe to go, so, once again, I was \"jipped' on my meal.   And as I finish eating it while I type my complaints, it was a turkey with vegetable crepe, but without gouda, the third ingredient I asked for.  Once again, a mis-done crepe from a HORRIBLE experience.  Let's hope Crepe Bar remembers what made them this popular (from food truck to restaurant) and can channel this again.  But, I , for one, will be finding my crepes in a less stressful, more efficient environment (and one that actually makes the food I paid for).",

Well, to my 1 to 2 crazy readers, this is a confession; I'm going to be with Crepe Bar, for-evs'.  (queue Psycho shower scene)  Seriously I think I've attained regular status here. The staff give me the 'heeeey...you're back...again' look when I walk in.  Not going to lie, kinda like it (and chiggity-check all them 'check ins'!).  You know what they say about creepy, unrequited love though...it's creepy.    Not sure if I stressed this in the original review (or even mentioned it) but get the breakfast burrito.  Damn it's fine n' tasty.  Also, after you've had their coffee, you may decide to cheat on/break up with your current coffee relationship (Seattle, I'm sorry...but it's over. I love Crepe Bar now.  shhhhhh).    And Jesus-H Christ they're serving fresh baked cookies now?; I'm fucked.  Should have engagement ring all set for next Thurs (fingers crossed!).    To the naysayers and ass-bags:  If you don't approve of their 'portion size', can't appreciate these peeps love for food or don't like the fucking rad art on their walls, then hit  up a different restaurant so I can have your table (their busy as crap lately).",

One lady in front of me took 10 minutes to place her order! As I creeped towards the young lady taking orders, I found out why. She was pleasant, but unnecessarily talkative and  socialized with everyone in the line.  As I sat and waited for my food, I noted that all of the employees were pleasant and attentive. My fresh squeezed OJ was great, but very pricey. All of the food they brought out looked very good. We ordered 3 crepes, one with chorizo and egg, one with ham, mushrooms, egg and cheese, and a dessert crepe with bananas. All were very good, but not superior to other crepe places I've been to (Flip Happy in Austin, TX is better and they serve theirs faster out of an old Airstream trailer).  Would I go back? Maybe, if I just had to have crepes in Phoenix.",

    "text": "We Usually always a great dining experience here But was unhappy with our last visit. I understand that the crepe bar takes pride in their prevention on their menu items but when a guest wants to alter, or would like something in addition to what they are ordering; crepe bar should be more accommodating to the customer ordering there food, especially if the customer is willing to pay to have it done.  I usually always ask for more chipotle salt... Really can't have any extra? Always an issue. I know it comes on the side but yes I still would like a little more. The big factor that was upsetting to me with crepe bar this last visit wasn't so much the salt but was trying to order an additional EGG UP on the side. They told me they can't do that. We'll if you don't want to ruin the presentation to the order, then have it come on the side on a separate plate. IM PAYING for what I want! But they still told me NO.  Just because crepe bar thinks their items on the menu are the best served how they come, not everyone is the same or has the same taste. If someone wants to make a slight change or wants to BUY a side of an egg or whatever it may be, they should be more accommodating. I am a loyal guest of the crepe bar I always have invited friends and family to come experience their food with me, but won't be back for a while and won't be talking it up either.    On top of not being able to order what I want, my toast was very burnt and the food didn't have quite the same flavor as it has in my past experiences.  Still enjoyed my food but that why I'm only giving this review a solid 3 stars.    Hopefully their customer service gets better! The gentleman with red hair and glasses is always very kind and attentive to the guest. But other then that hopefully they can start learning how to say YES",

I was very disappointed when I saw that the potatoes were indeed little flakes of squares that's sprinkled on top of the breakfast burro crepe, and that there wasn't any potatoes inside-definitely not worth the $1. Also, this place is way too small to cater to the large amount of people that wants to get breakfast. It was really awkward for our group (and others as well) to try to find a place to stand while waiting for our food.  While waiting, we noticed that another table ordered a bowl of cereal and a few droplets of milk for $4.25. That's outrageous and just doesn't make any sense.
