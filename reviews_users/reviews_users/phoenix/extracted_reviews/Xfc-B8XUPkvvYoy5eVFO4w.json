We snagged a corner table on the pet friendly patio and had a great \"family\" lunch.  I enjoyed a strawberry bellini - man, I could drink way too many of these amazing concoctions!  For our main meal, my hubby thoroughly enjoyed his carbonara and I thoroughly enjoyed my side sampler of cauliflower grits, spaghetti squash, broccolini, and creamed spinach...absolutely perfect!  Great atmosphere inside and out, great food and great service too!",

It can be a little awkward near some of the posts between the bar and the long table space adjacent to the front door, but that's minor.  The drinks are really good!  I had the Sweet and Spicy, and the Collins.  Spicy drinks are often something only I like, but this one had a nice level of heat and overall balance that my wife enjoyed.  The Collins was a solid gin drink, and they use Hendricks, which is always a winner for me.  The food was outstanding!  We had the gnocchi and short ribs, and the crab cakes.  They make the gnocchi with ricotta instead of potatoes, and it is light, silky, and delicious.  The crab cakes were the best I've had outside of Maryland or Florida.  The portions look small, but I think it's due to the plates; we had leftovers of both meals.  Dessert was just as good.  Get the chocolate cheesecake, and the cookies and milk.  You'll never think about either the same way again.  It was so good, we came back with the kids the next day!",

    "text": "Dine with caution ... first off our table was not ready at the requested time after a month in advance reservation. Once seated they seated us in a 6 person table for 8 people. We sat down and ordered drinks in which they served 1/2 of our group who ordered before the others. A couple of us ordered double dirty martinis and there was no issues until we changed our mind and decided a bottle of wine sounded better. However a bottle of wine apparently has more of an alcohol content than two double dirty martinis.... jokes all around because it does not!  Once they wouldn't serve us the bottle of wine I asked for the manager in which it took him over 20 minutes to come to our table. Only after I continued to demand him coming over did he arrive to tell us we would not be served due to someone being \"drunk\" at the table. I have no problem having a restaurant cut off one person at a table however please do not cut off those of us who are sober and then tell a very rationally speaking person they are hostile. We were a group of 8 professionals sitting at a table for a nice dinner I can assure you no one was drunk. However the best part is 8 people all ordering apps, full meals, drinks and bottles of wine are apparently not good enough for this restaurant. I have to say I have never been kicked out , denied or discriminated against in a restaurant nor have I ever acted in a way that has justified such. However the manager at this restaurant does not stop here..... we went next store to grab dinner now 8 pm. This restaurant surprisingly offered us a 10 minute wait time for a table then came back and said oh it will be 1 hour. However when we said no problem we will grab a drink at the bar we got the real story and the manager from the previous restaurant had called to inform them we should not be served due to our group challenging him. Grassroots then proceeded to inform us they wouldn't serve us. Again I have never been treated like this nor do I feel like we ever should have.... moral of the story this company and its sister restaurant have no interest in making money, being in a business of hospitality, or treating customers with one ounce of respect. Again dine with caution!",

    "text": "Great new neighborhood spot.  It's one of those menus where everything sounds good so it's tough to decide what to get.  That's a good thing.  Next time, we may get a bunch of apps to share so we can try some different dishes.  The flatbreads and oysters were great though.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The beer list has some interesting options and I hope they'll rotate some others through.      My only minor nitpick is the open kitchen.  Watching the food be prepared is cool and I get that concept.  What doesn't work, however, is the open dishwashing area.  They really need a door there.  It's unappetizing when seated at the bar and more so, it's crazy bright back there.  Seeing bright florescent light kills the vibe.  Again, minor nitpick and easily fixable.  This place is a welcome addition and I wish them well.",

    "text": "As a pregnant woman, it's already difficult enough to find something on a menu that sounds good to you when you have food aversions, restrictions, nausea and exhaustion and our waiter did not help at all. I just wanted to go out and catch up with a girlfriend at a casual, comfortable spot close to my office. I was able to walk there which was perfect and then as soon as we sat down i asked about the Cesar salad, to see if they make the dressing with raw egg. He insisted there is no egg in the dressing, he didn't even have to ask, so we said great give us a minute. About 10 minutes later he finally comes back to our table and says that in fact yes there is egg in the dressing. At that point, i was frustrated it took him so long to come back to us for our order and now just plain annoyed. I asked if i could just get some grilled chicken breast and order a side or an appetizer with it and he said NO. He insisted they won't just put chicken breast on a plate for me but what i could do is order the chicken sandwich and then just get nothing on it or with it. that sandwich is $13.00 and he was completely serious in his suggestion. I explained to him that i'm pregnant and having one of those days where nothing sounds good to me, can he just work with me here so i can have something to eat but he insisted there was nothing he could do, I would have to order a full entire meal off of the menu.  So i ordered the chicken sandwich had a few bites and took the rest home to my husband. I should have asked for a manager, or if the waiter wanted to be helpful, he should have suggested that he would go ask his manager if he could accommodate my request. I was almost in tears because of how complicated ordering was (pregnant lady hormones and everything) and Twisted Grove seemed to care less. The menu does sound good if I was not pregnant but because of the service here, i'm not interested in giving it another shot, I'll stick to Grassroots, the service there is leaps and bounds above and menu has much more variety.",

The avocado one was delightful (lol on my choice of words), marscapone was heaven and so was the tomato jam and arugula one. Even the green vegetable hating husband thought so.

The dish was served with French fries, and flavored with rosemary, thyme and cheese. I thought a glass of nice Italian red would go really well with the meal. Too bad I had to go back to work after lunch. Instead I ordered iced green tea with splash of pomegranate juice, it had refreshing taste.  My friend ordered salmon entree and from what I can see, it looked very moist inside and tasty. He said it was really good.   Before I decided what to eat for lunch, first thing I saw on the menu was desert. Tres Leches... While it wasn't the best I had (the best I had was at a Columbian restaurant in Florida.), I ate the whole thing in my own. Never crossed my mind about sharing. If you look at the picture I posted here, it was huge! I wasn't sure if I could finish it, but it had that sweet milky taste to it, it was gone before I knew it. It was so light, it didn't give me that heartburn feeling I get from some other desert.  Service wasn't what I was hoping. He said as soon as we walked in, he was swamped. He was walking around constantly and was busy. He was apologetic about slow service and did the best he could. Too bad it was understaffed.   They have other dishes on the menu I think will go well with wine. Would like to come back for dinner someday.",

Twisted Grove has a rustic American feel and brunch here is perfect!  You have an option you make your own Bloody Mary here, but I'm not a big fan of making of my own drinks however I will try next time and see how I feel about it - wink!  I came here with my friend on a Saturday afternoon after a good hike.  For drinks I went for an IPA and she shot for the Sweet & Spicy cocktail; tequila, grassroots sour, jalapeno agave, and cayenne salt around the rim. Overall, a solid drink and I always enjoy a spicy drink, with a full half jalapeno atop!    For our food I ordered the Southern Sunrise; a Green Chile Tamale with house made chorizo and black bean pico.  My friend went for the Twisted Noodle Salad which came with buckwheat soba noodles, kale, avocado, mango, cucumber, arugula, scallions, herbs, coconuts, peanuts, chili-lime vinaigrette and shrimps.  My dish was phenomenal!  I love tamales in general, but the sweetness of the tortilla puree really brought out the taste.  The black bean pico was cooked to perfection with a hint of cilantro spiciness.  The chorizo had an over-easy egg atop; what doesn't go well with eggs these days!?  The salad had a shmorgishborg of ingredients that at the end, jelled well together.  It was crunchy and subtle with a sweet and sour punch to your palates!  Service was on top of things here and again; I love the ambiance!  Overall, the food played music to my palates and this is a definitely a star in my books! - Enjoy!",

But though we had reservations and the place was pretty vacant, they seated us in the very back corner where I stared at the back wall the entire meal., so it wasn't very fun for me. We decided to try happy hour appetizers plus the Balsalmic Glazed Brussel Sprouts. The food was just ok. The Brussels sprouts were my favorite. Overall, not very impressed.",

We shared the grilled artichoke which was very good. It was 1 and a half artichokes and was more than enough to share. We also shared the twisted noodle salad which was very good. It was spicier than I would have imagines but very tasty. We had it with shrimp and it had several large shrimp in the salad and it came in a large bowl so there was plenty to share. It was definitely a good choice for lunch.",

I'm glad I made reservations because it was very busy for a Thursday.    I had to go with the most ordered plate, Gnocchi and Short Rib, which is beyond delicious; all my friends wished they got it themselves. Another crowd favorite was the prime rib, which they mentioned was cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be back for another round of dishes.

We started off with cocktails, I had the first one on the menu (grapefruit vodka drink) and it was good. My cousin got the sweet and spicy which I tried and that was amazing. The cayenne pepper rim is the perfect fit for it.   Yelpers raved about the brussel sprouts so we tried those and they did NOT disappoint! So delicious with a balsamic reduction sauce. I love my brussels crispy and these definitely had a char. For dinner I got the mushroom paparadelle and it was Fantastic! So flavorful and fresh. I would 100% get this again. One of my cousins got the crab cake salad which he enjoyed a lot. The crab cake was crispy. My other cousin got the cobb salad and she did not like it at all. She loves cobb salads which are always so flavorful because there is so much going on, and for some reason this salad had NO taste whatsoever. She said she would not get that again but would come back based on tasting our meals and having the brussel sprouts.  On a side note, they have private rooms for events and we hope they start having live music outside because its a great area for it.",

    "text": "Went to the Twisted Grove this past weekend with family on recommendation of my Brother-In-Law. The place is huge and wasn't particularly crowded for a Friday night. We had great service, since they had plenty of staff on hand and I really enjoyed the meal. We all shared some bruschetta to start, and most of the flavors we got I liked, but my favorite was the honey ricotta one. Some of the others didn't quite hit it out of the park. My sister and I shared the carbonara, and I loved the addition of brussel sprouts, which were a dominate player on the menu. In fact, the whole place smelled of brussel sprouts when we walked in... I didn't hate it.  For dessert, my Husband insisted on trying the tres leches cake, which is a personal favorite of his. I found it to be ok, but could use more moisture, which is what tres leches is known for. I think we will be back, but I love it's sister restaurant, Grassroots a bit more, but we will surely give this restaurant another try.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Twisted Grove.  Great presentation, and the amount of food is definitely healthy.  I thought the chicken flatbread was pretty amazing; really cheesy with a great spicy sauce served on top.    We also shared the grouper sandwich which was pretty much a crispy Kentucky fried piece of really  fresh fish.  It also had the perfect light and airy brioche bun, and excellently crisped garlic fries.  Be sure to ask for a side of their house aioli for the fries and the sandwich to enhance the flavor.  The sandwich really benefits from the added sauce as it is simply topped with their house slaw.  Seriously one of the best fish sandwiches I've had in Scottsdale and this is one week out of enjoying fresh fried snapper in Nassau.      IMO Atmosphere is best described as a hipster sports bar with craft cocktails and a healthy beer selection.  I could see this place filling up during the 6:30 - 8:00 dinner rush, but when we came around 9:00 the rush was done so it made for a really nicely paced meal.  I'll be back.  There's a lot more of the menu to explore.  They are definitely a welcomed addition to the growing Scottsdale food scene.",

She was there when we needed her - without hovering (a big plus) - gave us great recommendations and delivered exactly what we expected. High marks to the staff and chef! Only concern was that our reservation had been lost even tho we had confirmed earlier in the day. However, they accommodated us when we arrived and it was a non-issue. Kudos to all!!",

We started with the Brussels and I wish they had been cut into smaller pieces (some of the halves were HUGE!), they were still plenty flavorful.  As for dinner, I ordered the Crab Cake & Greens and maybe you shouldn't be ordering seafood in the middle of the desert, but the dish was amazing!  It tasted so fresh and paired perfectly with the remoulade underneath.  Everyone else seemed please with their food as well.",

Bruschetta tasted like the same cheese from my toes.

Innovative menu where everything comes together and much thought is put into making sure tastes are balanced and complimentary. Upon learning it was out first visit, Austin sent out a complimentary appetizer, the  Brussel sprouts.  Excellent. We had crab cake appetizer, gnocchi with short ribs and the wild mushroom pappardelle. All innovative, tasty and well portioned. The food was nice and hot when it arrived. Restaurant is clean. Environment is neighborhood folksy Americana.",

    "text": "Very disappointing is all I can say.  We've been to the Twisted Grove many times because we love their food and the atmosphere.  However, our most recent trip proved to be very different, almost as if we were in an episode of Bar Rescue.... before the rescue!  My family and I went for dinner on a Tuesday evening. After we placed our orders, it was approximately 20 minutes later when our waitress Emma came to inform us they were out of chicken. How can you be out of chicken on a Tuesday evening at 7:30PM especially when that is one of your staple ingredients for quite a few dishes on the menu?!  After trying to make another selection, it turned out they were also out of the main ingredient for another  dish.  At this time we asked to speak to the manager.  After 10 minutes one of the managers named Travis appeared at our table.  He was completely disheveled and his shirt was dirty/stained, which did not help the situation.  When we explained our frustration and inquired if running out of food was an occurrence that also happens at their other three restaurants, Travis was quick to respond with, \"it's actually 5 restaurants.\"  Really!?!  Seems to me Travis was completely missing the whole point and most concerning, was he didn't seem to even care.   Needless to say, we had guests with us and had spoken very highly about the Twisted Grove, so this was a very uncomfortable situation!  If we would have known they'd be out of food for some of their main dishes we would have gone elsewhere.  The only thing Travis did was correct the number of restaurants the group owns.  We were not looking for a free meal or anything like that, however we were looking for some acknowledgment or an apology, but at no point did Travis do or even say anything to attempt to rectify the issues at hand.  But wait there's more!  One of the dishes we ordered was the mushroom and Boursin cheese flatbread.  Every time we go, we order it and it's delicious.  When the flatbread was brought to the table we knew right away it was not made correctly because it looked very different and after tasting it, it tasted completely different.  Boursin cheese is a white crumbly cheese with garlic and various herbs in it.  The flatbread appeared to have only cheese on it which resembled Dofino cheese and it was paper thing, with no herbs to be seen and you certainly couldn't taste the garlic either.  In the past you could see the white colored Boursin cheese with its herbs on the top nicely melted, and you could taste it too! Not this time.  We called our waitress over and explained the situation.  Emma was very apologetic and sent the manager over.  Travis once again appeared and this time brought with him a little cup of cheese stating it was Boursin.  After looking at it and tasting it, yes it was Boursin, but that's not what was on the flatbread.  Travis then mentioned that the dish is actually made with Marscapone and 5 other types of cheese, not including the Boursin.  What - Really?!?!  That's the first time we'd ever heard about the dish having those other ingredients and it's not at all how it's written/described on the menu!  It was then very apparent that Travis was not only very unprofessional and uninformed, but judging from his behavior, and appearance, he just didn't care!  Needless to say we will not be recommending the Twisted Grove anytime soon.  The only positive from the evening's events was that our waitress Emma was very professional.  Maybe Travis should take some lessons from her and maybe the Twisted Grove should re-train their managers, including the teams in the kitchen and the chefs, to ensure they don't run out of food and that dishes are made correctly!",

    "text": "Awesome food and great for kids too!    We got the carbonara, burrata, parm garlic fries, cauliflower, and kids steak with broccolini and fruit.    Burrata was served with really tender yet crisp heirloom tomatoes and the accompanying olive oil tasted fresh and good quality.  We thought it needed a little salt for our taste but not much.  More pasty ricotta inside than a smooth creamy liquid but was still good.  Cauliflower surpassed any expectations.  Wonderfully robust flavors that matched well.  Fries were pretty standard but lacked the strong garlic flavor that we love.  Carbonara was so good.  Having sampled some of the best carbonara recently in Rome I have high expectations and this came through ranked near the top with the Brussels sprout addition that was really great.    However, the one thing that stuck out in my mind that was the best aspect of this place that usually gets overlooked even in the most upscale of dining is quality kids offerings!  The steak seemed like filet mignon it was so tender and velvety.  The side pairings were all good quality as well.  Very pleased.  Service was on par and very accommodating to custom changes to a couple of items we ordered.    Wonderful experience.",

Food came before our first drinks did. As we ate our food and were ready for refills on water and more drinks no one came by, even while other tables were being served. Finally we ordered more drinks from another waiter and it took another 20+ min to get them. We got them when we went inside and grabbed them from the bar tender since they were waiting on a serving tray. The nachos were pretty good and bruschetta was good. Drinks were okay...service was awful.",

The atmosphere was lively, yet intimate.  Our server, Amber, was fantastic and her recommendations were on point.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer which was delicious...even though I really wanted the brussell sprouts that she recommended (which is their signature, and has a gorgeous presentation!)  I had he crab cake dinner, and it was one of the best I've ever had.  Fresh, tons of crab meat, and flavor like no other.  The creamed spinach was equally fantastic and I could have eaten a whole plate of just that.  Drink-wise, the cocktail selection was unique yet familiar.  Also fabulous!  No complaints at all....cannot wait to go back and try more from the menu!",

The service was very slow and the order was messed up on the first round coming out. Had to be sent back.  We drove all the way from Chandler to try this place so that made it an extra bummer for us.

They came back with a strong Brussels sprouts or broccoli flavor. We told the waitress. She told us the fries are typically covered in garlic or Parmesan so you don't taste the flavor of the old oil. The waitress said she'd see what she could do. She brought us another batch of fries. This time, they were cooked in the same oil used to fry fish, so they had a strong fish flavor. I had the rotisserie chicken. It was slightly underdone, on the cold side and incorrectly deboned.  We didn't initially receive water with our meals. I requested water. The waitress brought me a glass of water, but nothing for the rest of the table. I could go on and on (the menu itself is goofy; every dish seemed to have at least one ingredient intended to offend the palate). The bottom line is this place should be avoided. It's sad because I like the sister restaurant Grassroots quite a bit. But this place is as close in quality to Grassroots as is the roller grill at 7-11.",

First, i tried a drink...was not a huge fan, but I would have drank it.  Bartender asked if I liked it, said honestly not really, she nstantly made me a different drink.  We started with Oysters...very good.  Then we ordered our main dishes.  I had the gnocchi and short ribs...holy cow it was wonderful!   My wife thought the same of her meal.  Throughout dinner the bartenders were very attentive, interacted the perfect amount, and were more responsive than most servers if we were at a table.  Both my wife and I agreed, it was such a pleasant discovery and we were disappointed we had not been there prior.  We will be back for sure.  Great place for food or just a cool place to have some drinks.  Everyone we chatted with at the bar were also super friendly.  Great area of town as well, and plenty of parking.",

The fish tacos were solid though I would've appreciated some hot sauce or pickled jalapenos w it.  We also got the cookies and chocolate milk.  The cookies were good but I never understood the chocolate milk thing, it makes them not taste as sweet.  Plus it wasn't icy cold.

By 8:10, we still were not seated at a table. We had to awkwardly stand around the bar just waiting until they put us somewhere. The staff continued to tell us that there was nothing they could do. We asked to speak to the manager and spoke to a young woman who again told us that they couldn't do anything to seat us despite our reservation time having come and gone.    We had young children and a couple of elderly people, it was getting late, we were all hungry, and the staff was all but ignoring us save for the few times we asked them when they would seat us. They pointed out the table they were waiting on but said the manager would not allow them to offer to move the table to the bar and buy a round of drinks in order to free up the table we had reserved for our party. While it is certainly not best practice, one of the members of our party went and kindly told them that we were celebrating a family member's birthday, we had reserved a table and we had been there for awhile waiting. The group apologized and immediately started to gather their things and go.   That was when a manager who had been absent up until this point came storming up to us and began to yell at our group in the middle of the restaurant. He sure didn't care that he had kept a large group with a reservation waiting, and he never made an attempt to come apologize or assure us we'd be taken care of as a good manager would, but boy was he happy to chew out a group of customers right there at the bar. After yelling at us he told us he could seat us. ??? What makes you think we're going to pay for food at your restaurant after you let us stand there with no food and nowhere to go for up to an hour and then proceeded to yell at us?   For the record, we later spoke to the table we'd been waiting on and they had seen the manager yelling at us. They offered themselves to go back inside and speak to him because they did not feel that my party had done anything to warrant that and were shocked at his behavior.",

Cocktails were very well crafted and the appetizers delicious. Entrees were ordered and arrived promptly. All were excellent in appearance, quantity, taste and quality.  The wine list, though compact, was comprehensive for the menu choices and reasonably priced. We were treated to complimentary desserts in recognition of the birthdays we had gathered to celebrate. Both the butterscotch pecan pie and tres leches were outstanding. In summary: pleasant, comfortable surroundings, friendly, attentive and efficient staff, good bar and mixologists, pleasing menu, good food that is prepared well, served in ample portions and reasonably priced.

There is a grouper fish sandwich which is to die for. The only thing I was disappointed about is that they serve wine in a stemless glass, which would be ok, but the glass is as thick as a jelly glass. I just love a light thin glass to drink my wine in. Also, the pours are stingy. I also want to add, the customers were such a diverse age which I love. I loved the restaurant and will definitely go back!",

    "text": "I started off with the summer style shandy. I'm not sure why I ordered it as I am not a big beer drinker. It was a good drink but a bit too tart for my liking. I moved on to the homegrown shandy which was also a bit too tart for my liking, I ended up sending it back as I wasn't going to drink it. Again, I do not blame this on the restaurant as much as my desire to try something new and different. They even left it off of the bill which I wasn't expecting at all since it was my fault for ordering it. I finally ordered something more in my wheel house and got the blueberry smash. This drink went down quickly, it was so GOOD! I highly recommend this light and summery drink.  As far as food goes we ordered the prime rib slider, grilled cheese board and the crispy fish tacos. We even strayed off of the happy hour to get their Brussels Sprouts as I am a huge fan of Brussels Sprouts.   The grilled cheese with the spicy tomato jam was excellent. The jam is not spicy (as I am not a spice lover I was very happy about this). This was a simple grilled cheese but touched up with the great jam. Also, this portion was quite a bit bigger than we were expecting. There were only two of us and I would say we probably should've ordered once less dish due to this portion size. This would be a good appetizer for 3 or more people if you are going to order more than one appetizer.  I enjoyed the fish tacos the best. I really enjoyed the pickled slaw and lemon aioli. Well done here.   The prime rib slider was a bit of a disappointment but we order too much food anyway so I wasn't disappointed to have less food to eat.     Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with the Brussels Sprouts as I've had them much better at other restaurants. I will say, their presentation of the Brussels Sprouts was cool, though.   Our server started out very personable and helpful but ended up neglecting us towards the end when we were looking for an additional drink. We ended up not ordering the drink. She was very helpful with our food choices in the beginning and she was very personable.   I would visit here again and give it another shot.",

The spinach salad was wonderful -- the pickled onions were perfect and the mustard dressing was a nice change. The cavatelli carbonara was perfect. Rich, but not filling. I am not surprised it is the owner's favorite.  Back to the service. The server at Sweet Provisions (owned by the same company, across the parking lot) put the staff at Twisted Grove to shame.

The potato error was rectified by them bringing out an entirely new entree which.was nice. The pork was not asked by the server for a requested level of doneness and was slightly overcooked. Due to the sweet glaze this hid the slightly dry pork, I would have prefered the pork more medium than well done.The spaghetti squash was very good. Cocktails were of decent quality for the price.",

The portions were about average but everything on the plate was white. No garnish or decoration of any  kind. I found this very unappealing. The meal was cold and I found the chicken very bland. Based on that experience I would never go back or recommend this restaurant. My husband ordered a mushroom dish. Though I found the description to be very different than what was served, it was served warm,  and was reasonably attractive. He would not return either. There are so many restaurants in the area you may want to try a few others. I have tried most of them. Twisted Grove was indeed disappointing.",

I've been twice, and the bartenders are awesome. They make one of my favorite cocktails I've had lately, the sweet & spicy! It's a spicy margarita that's really well balanced. Garnished with half of a red jalapeno and a chili pepper rim.... I'm craving one now just thinking about it! We also had the Brussels sprouts, delish.  The second time I went, we were seated in a side room. The ambiance wasn't great and the service was slow and indifferent. I had to get up to find the server. That being said, the drinks and food were good. We tried the fish tacos and bruschetta off of the happy hour menu. The tacos were great! Crispy, hot, flavorful. And I think only $5? Bruschetta board was good too, you can pick from a variety of flavors.  Overall, recommend, but sit at the bar!",

Picnic chicken was okay, my son liked everything , but Sazerac for $9 was his reason for stopping here.  Since it's my review there's nothing I had that would make me return. I thought the Shishito peppers were too hot for my liking. The Prime rib slider was okay. No garnishes like a little lettuce or carrot for the chicken.   We did get a coup for a free ice cream next door for the baby.",

We enjoyed charred brussel sprouts with roasted garlic and balsamic vinegar....these were heavenly and so tasty.   Gotta have these.   We all enjoyed fresh Caesar salads, I opted to add blackened shrimp to mine.  The shrimp were huge and six added to salad.   One in our group had the spinach bacon salad which got rave reviews too.  So glad we took a business associates recommendation to eat here.  Will come back if in the area.   Service by Zoe was on point and very pleasurable.   She made sure we were well taken care of and enjoyed our lunch.",

Crab and greens: nice amount of fresh crab lumps throughout the cake; light breading which is preferable and fresh greens such as the arugula nuttiness. $17 perfect light salad.   Angry bird: crusty crispy flatbread made with a delicious noice at every bite; with white and dark meat of a rotisserie chicken, basil, cheese and tabasco sauce. Cut into 8 pieces.   4 Sides: spaghetti squash was cool and refreshing side with shallot lemon butter reggiano but didn't taste any of the lemon butter; roasted cauliflower was smothered in  garlic tahini sauce and charred onions and it on the salty side; smashed potatoes had bacon bits and scallions and cheese which gave a good carb; creamed spinach had artichoke and creamed reggiano cheese which tasted like any other creamed spinach and could have some pita chips to compliment this. $16  Water were always filled except towards end. I was about to take a pic of the menu but the server grabbed it and took it away! Too funny! Sorry no picture for this but at least there are plenty others.   Overall great casual experience and good food.",

    "text": "It makes me kind of sad to sit and write this review. We have been to Twisted Grove a number of times and have really enjoyed it. As a matter of fact 2 years ago my husband ordered the Pork chop for  dinner and he was hooked. It became the standard to which no other pork chop could come close and they never failed to live up to expectation. Well, until  last night that is. We have out of town friends and family here this week. After Dan couldn't stop raving about how perfectly prepared and delicious the chop has always been, everyone decided that we would make a reservation for the 6 of us on Wednesday night. We arrived and were seated. Our waitress, who never actually greeted us or introduced herself asked if we wanted a drink. She failed to listen to someone in our party who was very specific on how they wanted their drink prepared but was not made at all as requested. That aside when she came to take our orders she was not helpful when asked questions or suggestions. It seemed that she either wasn't very familiar with the menu or that she wanted us to just shut up and order. Our appetizers came and they were ok. The bruschetta was good, but not outstanding. The ceasar ok, nothing special. Then came our entrees. Obviously , restaurants change the manner in which things are prepared and adjust the accompaniments  accordingly to combine flavors and ingredients that go well together so even though it may not be exactly the way you remember, it is equal in quality and flavor.  Well, that has been our experience here over the past 2 years. Tonight when entrees arrived 3 of the 6 of us had ordered the pork chop. From the moment the plates were placed on the table, it looked nothing like the chops.we have had here before. It was dry, not plated nicely, and it seemed that the sides were thrown on as an after thought. Our server never came back to check on the table and all 3 of us who had  the chop were very very disappointed. It was fatty,  full of gristle, undercooked and basically not edible. The spaghetti squash was tasteless and the blistered tomatoes not much better. The other 3 in our party said their food was fine but nothing outstanding.  When our server was walking by the table, my husband called her over and spoke with her very quietly and nicely and just inquired if this was a new chef, or had they changed purveyors for the meat served. She said she was unaware of any changes but never even asked why he was inquiring. He proceeded to tell her why anyway, very disappointed yet very politely what a big let down the meal had.been. she just gave him a blank look, while proceeding to clear the table.  She never asked anything about why the 3 pork chops had gone basically uneaten. She never asked if anyone wanted coffee or dessert, and proceeded to just drop.the check on the table without being asked for it. Now we had only been in the restaurant for maybe an hour at most.and we were not the only customers in the restaurant. When we asked her if we could have coffee and dessert she actually had another tables dessert in.her hand on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fway.to&s=f84e6423f14f2d557358413010fe04ad08eac9ea667fc8e208248a325e7d9b71\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">way.to</a>.drop it off to them so she said she would be right back.  She was. So we ordered coffee and a couple of chocolate chip cookies (which have also been yumny on past visits). She told us  the kitchen was closed and we could only have coffee. We told her to.forget it.and we would go.somewhere else for coffee and dessert , which is exactly what we did. All 6 of us in agreement that was the best part of our dinner last night.   I'm sorry to say to the twisted grove that although we have had many a wonderful meal and pleasant evening with you, tonight was unpleasant and disappointing enough  that it will be a very longtime, if ever ,that we visit again.",

Upshot-kids eat free from 2-6pm daily, so you get what you pay for!  Healthy pours on drinks.

    "text": "Came here Tuesday night for dinner.  The parking lot of this entire strip mall is pretty busy and walking up to the restaurant we noticed it was pretty busy inside, especially for a Tuesday night.  The hostess was speaking with someone else on staff but attended to us promptly.  We were seated and I'm not sure which came first, us sitting down or our server coming to ask us if she could get us any drinks.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  She then said she would go bring us some waters and give us a few minutes.  She returned promptly.  We did not specifically order drinks, just hot water with lemon.  Needless to say the service was great the rest of the evening.  There was only a stretch of time where she disappeared for a while but it was due to her getting a few large groups all at once.  For food between our party of 3 we ordered the arcadia club, angry bird flat bread, and 4 sides, cauliflower, broccolini, spaghetti squash and loaded smashed potatoes.  The sandwich came with parmesan-garlic fries.  Taste-wise everything was delicious.  The fries were crispy and the seasoning was perfect.  The cauliflower had a nice roasted flavor.  The potatoes were nice and cheesy and had a great balance between the different elements, and I was able to get all of the flavors in each bite I had.  I would've given 5 stars but I took 1 star off for the flat bread.  This might be a definition difference.  The flavor on it was great, it was just the flat bread itself wasn't really what I was expecting.  I expect flat bread to be about a quarter of an inch thick, maybe even half an inch thick.  This flat bread was probably an inch and a half to 2 inches thick.  Very bready.",

Being from the east coast, I Know what real crab cakes should taste and look like. These were the best I have seen and tasted. They had a nice,even browned outer layer that wasn't to breaded, so you could taste the wonderful crab mixture inside. They weren't stuck together by breading and mayonnaise, but rather flaked easily because they were all crab with just the right amount of seasoning to make them delicious.  If you have been searching for the perfect crab cake, this is the place!",

We started with their brussel sprouts in which both presentation and flavor were great. For entree, I got their cobb salad which was full of fresh flavors. It was also topped with onion straws, which was a nice touch of crunch to this salad.  After eating our entrees, although we were full we had to try the hot cookies with a shot of chocolate milk. What a great dessert, yet again with wonderful presentation. The service was awesome. If we are ever in the area again we would be sure to make time to eat at this establishment again.",

I was dining alone so I took a seat at the bar. I was pleased to find the bat had purse hooks, small detail but much appreciated. I was promptly greeted by a friendly bartender. Ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and the portion was huge and the taste was delicious with bacon and roasted garlic cloves. Fun presentation as it was served on a wooden board with a tipped glass jar. So many tasty sounding dishes made it hard to decide on a meal but my bartender recommended the fried chicken sandwich with apple slaw on a brioche bun. It was the special so I gave it a try. I was not in the mood for french fries so he suggested substituting the tahini and grilled onion roasted cauliflower, what a great suggestion!  It was delicious and the cauliflower alone will bring me back to this place again!",

Both dishes were well executed and worth having a second time!  Nice wine list - we ordered a great white blend that complimented the entire meal.

This last time I ate there I noticed that the refills are constant and almost appear out of nowhere- something that stands out in comparison to other restaurants. What really made this experience great is how friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable the manager Travis was. He checked in on my group a couple times and was very helpful when we were deciding what to order! I will definitely be back 1. For the Brussels Sprouts (literally the best I have ever had) and 2. Because of the great service from our server and the manager Travis!! Thank you!!!",

They had candied bacon, olives, blue cheese stuffed olives, horseradish, celery, pepperoncini and many hot sauces.  The frozen glass was a nice touch.  My wife ordered the crab cake and salad.  They didn't have any dressings without dairy in them except for oil and vinegar.  When she asked if she could have a different side instead of the salad, the bartender said they won't substitute in the lower priced items but if she ordered a high priced item, they would substitute the side.  Really Twisted Grove??  Anyhow, the crab cake was delicious.  I ordered the Cavatelli pasta.  It was good but could have used more sauce.  The portion size was more than enough.  Overall, would have been a great experience had the staff responded in a way that said they wanted us to enjoy the experience.  Saying no to a substitute side because they don't have any dressings that don't have dairy in them is a turn off.  Not sure we will be back.",

So far Twisted Grove has been a great evening out with my hubby (minus our toddler, although it seems kid friendly) as well as for a lunch business meeting (not to loud and service was on point, both key for business meetings.) My only critique would be enhancing the Cobb salad, just needs a little more zest and/or chop to it. The bruschetta, on the other hand, was dynamite!!",

We also ordered a prime rib to share between my boyfriend and I. We ordered medium rare but it came out really rare. It was pink. Our friend accidentally mistaken the prime rib for salmon because it was so pink. The service was great though. They immediately took corrective action and it tasted great after. I also got to try the oysters. Most of it was pretty fresh but it wasn't consistent since we had some weird tasting ones. Overall, this is a really good place to hangout and have fun with friends.",

I am so glad we ended up here! The menu is a bit broad, but everything we ordered was wonderful! We started with the artichoke appetizer, which I highly recommend for a not so filling appetizer and one that's easy to share. For entrees (after much deliberation), we ordered the gnocchi w/ short rib and the crab cake entree. The gnocchi was pillowy while also being crispy. My mom always talks about Maryland crab cakes that are \"no filler, just crab.\" And that is exactly how I would describe this crab cake. See picture for the huge chunks of crab! We sat at the bar, and the service was great. My one complaint is that they have the \"False bottom\" wine glasses that make it seem like you are getting a huge glass of wine- when really it's just a normal size! A bit tacky, but truly that was my only very small complaint.",

    "text": "I am updating my review from a good one to a bad one. I was very disappointed in the service I received tonight. I come to this place all the time and always get great service. This was the second year I decided to have my birthday dinner here and we made reservations 5 days prior through open table requesting a booth.  We walk in and the hostess was short with us. We told her we had a reservation and it was for a booth. The hostess told one of the other girls to seat us in the very first booth, well I had asked before we got seated if we could have a booth a few tables down because I didn't want to sit right by the door and we made these reservations in advance so I assumed they would reserve a nice table for us. The hostess was mad that we asked and even rolled her eyes as she sat us at the new table.   Our server Heidi, seemed annoyed we were there. First off she took to long to greet us and second when she did get there we weren't sure what we wanted to drink and instead of giving us recommendations she just said she would be back. While we ordered food I asked for a substitution of goat cheese for my salad and she made it seem like it wasn't doable. She just seemed so annoyed we were there and wasn't very warm. When the food I came I got my order the way I wanted and it was great! But then she never came around to refill our waters.   When they brought out the dessert they didn't bring us any utensils my boyfriend and to find two of them on the ledge by where we were sitting. So the four of us had to share two forks for the dessert. Heidi never asked us if we wanted separate tabs and brought one check. When we told her we needed two separate checks she looked confused and wanted us to split it down the middle. You can clearly see it's two couples dinning together, like why wouldn't you ask from the get go? Well she messed up the separate tabs regardless and only gave one couple their itemized receipt. We had to ask for the other one and she was so rude about it.   I feel like she thought we looked young and we weren't gonna tip so she decided to give us poor service. Well that reflected in her tip. I'm also disappointed a manager wasn't making rounds at the tables to see how everyone was doing. I would've addressed all of this with him. I've been working in the food industry for years so I know how things go. The server and the hostess were so snobby and acted like we inconvenienced them.   I'm truly dissatisfied and disappointed that I chose this place for my birthday and probably won't recommend them any time soon.",

Service is somewhat slow, but that's easy to overlook with great company. The menu has something for everyone, and while there are some eclectic choices, picky eaters can do just fine here.  Dinner tonight was the salmon entree - cooked to perfect! The broccolini was slightly under cooked but the green goddess sauce over it was delicious.   We always get the Brussels sprouts - these are some of the best in town! We always order them well-done. The bacon pieces in the mix are thick and hearty. So good!   My boyfriend always gets the carbonara with an over easy egg - he's the picky eater, but this is one of his most favorite dishes! We definitely recommend this, and also the gnocchi with short rib. Yum!",

I ordered a medium well burger and it came rare. When I cut it in half the juices ran out all over which wouldn't have been an issue if it was cooked to my request. When the server took it back to the kitchen they took the meat off the bun and incinerated it then returned it to the soggy bun. The manager dropped the now awful burger with aged side at the table without uttering a word. I should have refused the lousy attempt at \"making it right\". He never touched the table again or apologized. He seemed clueless. Topher should be ashamed of his staff's performance today.",

The food here is so well done, all the flavors so nicely compliment one another. The cocktails here also on point. My personal favorite is the Fleur Du Lis. They environment of this restaurant is what I would describe as 'rustic'. It has a south western vibe to it, but it's really done in such a nice way. Every waiter(ess) I've ever had here has been extremely personable, kind, and very knowledgeable on the menu. My biggest recommendation for this place is to head over during happy hour and get a couple things off the happy hour menu. Specifically, the Brussel sprouts and picnic chicken are delicious! Don't like brussel sprouts? Just try these! They will absolutely change your whole view on the vegetable! Amazing place, can't wait to come back again and again!",

Coming to the food, we ordered iced green tea with angry bird flat bread which is yummy and eggplant stack for vegetarian guys accompanied with some French fries topped with parm cheese and herbs. We also tried roasted cauliflower which is ok for my taste buds. Allover our experience is nice and YES!! recommended place who are looking to hang out on weekends.",

Both were set up nicely, but we also brought our own decor. The food was delicious and prompt. Maya was great to work with and accommodated our last minute changes. She was great with communication and responsive throughout the process which was an immense help to our wedding planning. The service and bartenders were attentive and the drinks were excellent! The only issue (but not that big of an issue) was only the popular drink selections could only be ordered at the patio bar. All others had to be ordered at the restaurant bar. The Boardroom came with a private section of the front patio that included a fireplace. Overall I would highly recommend Twisted Grove for an event!",

    "text": "I drive by the Hayden location at least twice a day, but until last month had never stopped in for a meal. The first visit - we really enjoyed the food!   So, for Father's Day, I ordered my husband's favorites (takeout) - grilled artichokes, roasted cauliflower and Brussel sprouts (MINUS bacon).    When I called in the order, I specifically requested 'no bacon' and confirmed that none of the items were cooked in bacon grease or any other animal fat. My husband was thrilled when I got home...until we (both vegetarians for 20+ years) realized that the crispy, yummy Brussels in our mouths were accompanied by thick chunks of BACON!   It wasn't the end of the world, so I called the restaurant and asked to be credited back for the brussel sprouts. The woman who answered - Maya - offered to make a new order. We were already home and eating dinner, so I again asked her to just credit me back for the order of brussels.    To me, this seemed like a reasonable and logical solution...as i wasn't requesting a full refund, just a credit for the item that was wrong. However, she explained that it's against 'company policy' to refund customers for mistakes on to-go orders, and the only option is to pick up a replacement order. She then went on to say that this policy is the reason people should thoroughly check their order before leaving the restaurant. Wow, so now it's my fault that I didn't receive the correct order?!?!?!  I asked for a manager, and Maya stated that she was the manager, and repeated the \"company policy\" - and added that there are 'no exceptions.'  When I said how ridiculous this sounded, she replied, \"I'm not sure why you feel that way.\" At that point, I was DONE. DONE. AND DONE.  My husband was so annoyed that he jumped back in the car and \"returned\" the bacon-filled order of brussels. He told the manager that he intended on writing a review, to which she replied \"if that makes you feel better, you should.\"   In short, I just discovered this restaurant and loved the food. I live nearby and would've been a long-time customer...but now have no plans to return.",

We responded and said, \"About 45 minutes we're here for lunch\". She stated we were not allowed to park there due to taking up too much space. We choose another place to eat in the plaza.

    "text": "Ok so this is the first time I've written a second review on a restaurant. I really wanted this restaurant to be great tonight. I made a reservation a few days in advance for myself and hubby, 3 sons and one teenage son's girlfriend. I have tried making  his published short rib recipe before and it has come out wonderfully.. was anxious to taste it again .  Hostess was friendly, smiled asked for a few minutes and  and then within minutes sat us...awesome. That's why there is one star. Then unfortunately Heidi our waitress came over but the only way we knew her name was from the bill at the end. No \"hello\" , no \"introduction\" No small talk. Just \" What do you want to drink\". My husband and I immediately tried to be extra friendly to win her over since our last visit here had bad service. She slowly started to get a bit more friendlier as the night got on and we asked her opinions of the menu choices. Here were the major problems... we noticed there was a gluten free bread option so we asked if the bruschetta could be made on gluten free bread. She had no idea. The answer back from the kitchen was \" ok but it won't look pretty\". We were totally fine with that. Appetizers were brussel sprouts which were good but a little dry . GF bruschetta was good. Then we ordered. The special was sea bass and mushroom risotto and it was bland. Two kids had salmon and said it was ok. My son's prime rib was dry. I of course asked for the short ribs which I always order if on a menu and since I make his recipe at home Had to try it again. The short ribs come with gnocchi which I said they could just keep off or substitute with mashed potatoes.  You would've thought I asked for oil to be mixed with vinegar. The answer from the kitchen was an absolute no and I am very easy going and said no problem just bring me a side of mashed potatoes which for some reason she wasn't understanding. So I slowly said ok just bring me the dish with a side of mashed potatoes.  I'm not celiac at all just sensitive . Well I was glad I had the short ribs because now I know for sure mine are way better!  I was surprised that they cut the ribs into smaller pieces from last year and some were fatty. Well we all ate and left full but never had that great experience that made us want to stay and linger with coffee and dessert. Unlike the first review I wrote, the dishes were picked up timely. Just lacking that smiling waitress, that great food experience and that kitchen that wants the local business. Sorry! Too many other great restaurants here to try. Won't visit again.",

Our server Tony was at our table within minuets taking our drink orders. I got the Blueberry Smash.....so good! Others had the Fluer Di Lis & Strawberry Martini. We started with the goat cheese bake & Brussel sprouts, both delicious! Dinner consisted of the sausage flatbread, crab cakes & steak gnocchi. As if that wasn't enough food we ended with their French press coffee, chocolate cheesecake & ricotta desert. This place is a must try! Sit in Tony's section, he's the best! We all will definitely be repeat visitors! Check Twisted Root out!!!!",

I had asked for outdoor reservations, we waited a few minutes but not bad considering how busy they were. They have a really large selection of draft beer,  wine not as much but OK for us.  The food was very good.  The flatbread was nice and chewy, toppings really flavorful.  The caulifower \"grits\" very tasty as well.  The blackened redfish was a tad or the dull side, as was my husband's fish sandwich.  If not for that, I would have given them 5 stars. The service was pretty good, especially for a new place.  We'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "Viva la brussel sprouts! Do yourself a favor and get them. Perfectly charred and fantastic. Even the presentation was the best I've seen yet for brussel sprouts! Our waitress said they are the number 2 selling item on the menu, the number one being the grouper sandwich.  Everyone in our group this evening loved their meal! We all had those \"oh my gosh this is good!\" moments. Even our friend from Italy gave two thumbs up on her Wild Mushroom Pappardelle, which is a big deal coming from her. She said order it as is, do not add meat, as the flavors were perfect and balanced!  She then lamented that Italians don't put chicken, shrimp, etc on their pasta the way Americans do!  My husband really enjoyed his grouper sandwich. Our friend loved his Gnocchi & Short ribs, but he wished the dish had a larger portion. To be fair, he was warned by our waitress ahead of time about the portion size. My salmon and spaghetti squash was excellent. My piece of fish was really fresh, large, and well prepared. Our side of cauliflower grits were delicious as well and worth getting.   Twisted Root, Twisted Grove, I don't care what they end up calling it... we will all be back! We also all decided that we preferred this over Grassroots. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. For me, I have to crave and day dream about going to a particular restaurant to make it 5 stars.  Side note: The owner was the only person smart enough to convince the landlord to construct a wall in the restaurant reducing the enormous square footage by 50%. I believe that's part of the reason why all other restaurants failed in this space, way too massive of a footprint which caused them to always look empty!",

I ordered the same entree consecutive times: the Beef Short Ribs and Gnocchi with the lemon buerre blanc. It is bliss, it melts in your mouth, the pan seared Gnocchi is soft and crunchy at the same time. The buttery sauce accompanies the beef's au jus so well. The chocolate and cherry cheesecake was so rich and smooth. My favorite place by far.  The service my boyfriend and I experienced so far was also wonderful. I can't remember the first server's name, but Amber was our server the other day. She had a great attitude and was very helpful and friendly. My only complaint is at the very end of the meal she announced how much the bill was for, which displeased my boyfriend who has traditional values in that the lady shouldn't have to worry how much the meal cost. She was also very eager to get the final check back and asked for my boyfriend to hand it to her after the tip had been accounted for. Her service was great, but just those things I think the business should be mindful of.",

The server was friendly and gracious with our kids. We appreciate good food, as do our kids, so we are always on the lookout for place like Twisted Grove that has tasty high quality food, laid back atmosphere and does not just offer chicken fingers for kids! In fact we loved that the kids dishes came with broccolini (which happens to be their favorite vegetable). I am also glad we came at an off hour and didn't bother anyone with our kids in the patio--the inside looked more formal so we will have to try that on a date night. We ordered a bit everything on the recommendation of our server and veteran friends so tried the short ribs and gnocchi, eggs in a hole, noodle salad, and crab cakes. Great selection of beer and wine by the glass too. Happy to have found this spot!",

In December, we called them up (as we planned our wedding in 4 days) and they just happened to have a holiday party cancellation that allowed for us to reserve the entire outside area for  40 people for our reception dinner. Karen and her team went ABOVE and BEYOND our expectations. We met with her and planned out all details just two days prior. They we're extremely accommodating, from setting up all of our decorations the day of to packing them up that night for us. The food was outstanding as always, and my husband, being the soup lover that he is, was really looking forward to having it on our menu. Prior to this, Twisted Grove did not have soup on their menu. They took this special request and made an absolutely delicious shrimp bisque!! You've got to try their food anytime you have the chance and when it comes to a lunch or dinner event, this is the place to host it!!",

If I didn't have to pay $35/person, put up with the Country Kitchen dated decor and awful lighting that makes everyone look ghastly and generates so much glare you can't read the menu, and acoustics worse than the auto auction I just left --  I would definitely return for the very good cocktail and the best brussels sprouts I've ever had.  If Twisted Grove had a food truck I'd be their first customer.    If you don't mind bad atmosphere and high prices in order to get amazing food, you might really enjoy Twisted Grove.  I can't imagine I'll be back anytime soon, however.",

    "text": "Big 5 for this one. Absolutely great. Why have I not been here before to this little gem. Totally up my alley in terms of food, ambiance, and atmosphere.  Came here for lunch for the first time and I will be back for sure. They had a totally cool front door entrance. And very welcoming inside. The hostess was right there smiling and it started off very well from there.   We got seated promptly in a long nice comfy booth and cool table. We had a bunch of items.  First we had the Brussel sprouts with bacon and a balsamic glaze. Wowoweeee. This was good. Loved the crispy bacon and glaze. The presentation was awesome as well. Check the pic I posted. Then we had the spinach dip. Nachos came with a crema sauce and peppers to add to the flavor. The spinach was hot and also in a cool display not just a normal jar. I like that.   For the main entrees my buddy got the gnocchi with braised short rib and I got the twisted noodle salad with steak and extra dressing. I tried some of the gnocchi and it was so good. The salad was perfect. Not too heavy and filled me up and didn't feel bad after. Great flavor, steak was done perfectly.  Our server Teghan was super friendly and nice. Very prompt with follow up and checked on us multiple times. She got it.   Overall great and well deserved 5 all the way from me. I will be back.",

We were provided a server just for our party and he (Ron) was very attentive and considerate.

Went here for happy hour and in two hours, few drinks and two appetizers came to $100, certainly not your cheap happy hour spot that's for sure :)  The service is always attentive and I really like the ambiance, the rustic decor. They have tvs playing assorted sports which is cool. The crowd is the typical Scottsdale folks so you can make your own assumptions ;)  The drinks are well made. Appetizers are ok - the salmon poke and Brussel sprouts were good, although the sprouts were a bit too big. I had been there before on lunch time and had a procciuto flatbread, and that was exceptionally good. I think they have two different menus because I didn't see the flatbreads when I went there for the evening.  It's a cool spot for a casual weeknight date and I'd go back.",

    "text": "I wasn't too impressed with Twisted Grove. There are a lot of similar, modern American places in Scottsdale so it's hard to stand out through all the competition. While the food was pretty good - we tried a variety of appetizers and entrees - there wasn't anything that would make me come back in particular, and we also had a problem with bacon in the vegetarian plate.   The vegetarian soba noodles had a random piece of bacon, when it's not part of the dish; and the Brussels sprouts also had a random piece of bacon mixed in, when we had explicitly asked for it without the bacon since we had vegetarians in our group. It seems like the kitchen doesn't do a very good job separating meat and vegetarian, unfortunately. Our server was also unfriendly - she seemed annoyed with our presence - but she did keep filling our water. We got mixed vibes from her.   Overall, I wouldn't come back since I didn't love the food and the cocktails were kind of boring. However, one upside to this place is that it's very big, with plenty of space between tables, and seating for larger groups. If I had to plan something for work, without vegetarians, I might consider this place since it would get the job done, but that's about it.",

The picnic chicken was yummy! I'd get a full serving of this if they had it. From the regular menu, we also ordered the roasted chicken BLT (comes with a side of fries) and the twisted noodle salad. Both the BLT and the salad were a generous serving size and tasted great.  I'd come back here again for nicer occasions and try their drinks!",

For drinks, we felt like ~treating ourselves~ to some of their \"fine cocktails\". I had the Strawberry Bellini and my boyfriend tried the Sazerac. The Bellini was okay, nothing special. Strawberries aren't really in season right now, and you could tell by the taste of the puree in the drink; it was kind of sour. But at least then you know it's fresh fruit lol. They also had a bartender-in-training that night, who accidentally made my boyfriend's a double so we weren't complaining about that :)   For the appetizer we tried the Bruschetta Board with the mascarpone, prosciutto and sweet pepper relish, the ricotta, candied bacon and crispy onion salad, and the burrata, jammin' spicy tomato, arugula and sea salt. All were yummy, but not the best bruschetta I've ever had. The ricotta with bacon and onions was definitely our favorite. The one with sea salt was a little too salty for my taste.   Then, for dinner, I had the Cavatelli Carbonara, which I really enjoyed. I like that they add brussels sprouts, which isn't something I normally get in pasta. A little saucy, but very good! I really enjoyed the leftovers. My boyfriend got the Grassroots Caesar Salad with chicken, which was also very good (I kind of wished I ordered that!). The croutons were humongous, lol I took some snapchats but wish I saved a photo. I did think at $16 it was a bit expensive for a Caesar salad, but that's okay. Overall, this place was quite good! :)",

I can confidently say 50% of our experience was pleasant, the other 50% was a total miss. While the Yelp favorites were tasty (Brussels Sprouts and the grouper sandwich) my mom's order of the French onion soup and bruschetta were totally off. The soup was full of bread and cheese, she sent it back, while the bruschetta was made with almost stale, tough bread that hurt to chew on. The waitress took her dinner break while we were eating so there wasn't a second opportunity for us to really provide feedback on it. For the prices paid we won't be returning, and we're disappointed considering the relation to such a hit restaurant like Grassroots.",

Since we didn't have a reservation, we were seated at one of the community tables (otherwise it would have been a 40 minute wait). The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the staff were all very kind, and we are so happy we decided to stop in and give this place a try.   We ordered the brussel sprouts and a bruschetta board to start. The brussel sprouts were awesome... truly some of the best that I have tried in a while. And out of all of the places in Scottsdale/PHX currently trying to rival Postino's bruschetta, these guys did it. It was all delicious.   My husband and I opted to share the wild mushroom pappardelle. I wish I had just kept this order to myself. I did NOT want to share it. If we weren't at a community table, I would have licked the plate with zero shame.   We finished up with the tres leches cake. Truly... no words.   The beer selection was really good, and they have Schramsberg Mirabelle Rose. So they win in my book. ;) I thought that this place would be overpriced bar food. Absolutely not the case. Great atmosphere with super reasonable pricing for such amazing food! This is going to be a go-to spot for us.",

    "text": "Made reservations on Open Table for my daughter's 19th birthday - they only had tables available on the patio (was a little worried about it being too cold but that is where she wanted to go so we went for it).  We arrived, the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded - they put the 3 of us at a round table for 6 which was a little awkward.  We weren't offered any other options (inside or otherwise).  When our waiter arrived, she told us about the specials and we ordered an appetizer (which she offered to comp since we were first timers), a lemonade and 2 glasses of wine.  Water was brought out for 2 of us, so we asked for another and never received it.  The appetizer came out after a decent wait - still no wine.  We were nearly finished with the appetizer when the waiter came back to ask us if we were ready to order.  We pointed out that we were still waiting for our wine - she seemed confused and went away to see about that.  Another wait.....then we ordered and THEN our wine appeared.  My husband had finished his glass by the time the meal came - our dinners were dropped off without any ask on refills for anyone (daughter's lemonade was also empty and we still didn't have the 3rd water).  My daughter and I each had an entree that was $32 - both were ok - definitely not exceptional.  I got the crab cakes which were very mayonnaise laden and came with coleslaw and French fries.  Was it worth $32 - definitely not.  My daughter had the prime rib and said it was good.  My husband had the gnocchi and short ribs which wasn't actually gnocchi but ricotta \"puffs\" which were good but not gnocchi.  There was no mention of the birthday we noted on our reservation.  We had been there for quite some time by the time we finished our meal (still no offer of an additional glass of wine or anything) so we decided to cut our losses and take her out for ice cream on the way home.  So much for \"special occasion\" or \"birthday\" being noted.  I don't think I'd go back.",

    "text": "Twisted Grove is a new American restaurant with a truly well curated atmosphere. The food is the star of the show, though. If you're looking to spend $20 on lunch, Twisted Grove is at the top of my list in Scottsdale. But it's hard to ignore the heavy wood entry doors, the community library inside the entryway, and that anything that can be put in a glass jar is certainly in a glass jar.    Unless it's the Brussels sprouts, which were artfully spilled onto a board. The sprouts were crispy and not greasy. The pepper-glazed goat cheese was absolutely sinful. I took one bite and realized what gluttony truly meant. I felt like a king. The wild mushroom pappardelle was phenomenal: light, savory, and rewarding. I found myself thinking like the first grader that wants to eat his M&M's at a proportional rate, but then stuffs his face with M&M's because chocolate is sinfully addictive. Here's a bit of arugula, and now a mushroom, oh how about some pasta... and before you know it, all control is lost and I'm inhaling the rest.   My colleague asked me why I was writing down the music that was playing. I explained knowing Twisted Grove played Mr. Brightside, Spoon, Hang Me Out to Dry, but also Christmas music was useful for folks trying to understand the vibe. She told me that knowing they had a private dining room for group seating would be helpful. So if you're wondering, yes, they play alt rock and holiday music during the holidays, and they do have a room in the back.   Our server was cool. She knew we were in a rush, and her execution was as flawless as it was fun. If everyone visibly exuded optimism and cheerfulness like she did, I think we'd all live in a more pleasant world.   I would certainly come back. I actually took a chicken sandwich from Twisted Grove to my manager, who exclaimed that it was the best chicken sandwich he'd had in months. I hate that this restaurant with its quality and pricing is in the fru fru part of Scottsdale, but the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was inviting.",

The sun was going down which was rather uncomfortable, but the hostess quickly noticed our squinting faces and lowered the blinds.  GREAT JOB!  You would be surprised how some people don't notice things like that...  The place already won my heart as I scanned the drink menu... Sazerac!  If you are a bourbon lover, and you haven't had one yet... you are missing out!  Any place that offers them, I'm all over it and Twisted Grove prepares a nice one!!  My wife ordered up the Arcadia Club and I went with the Angry Bird flatbread.  Both food items came out promptly and well prepared.  The club was a good sized sandwich and didn't fall apart.  The flatbread had a great texture from the dough and nice flavors.  Thanks for a great experience!",

Service was good, the atmosphere was very welcoming! $3 for a 10oz green tea.  Yes, the food is good, but it is way too expensive for what you get, especially the salads!",

    "text": "Their buckwheat noodle salad is amazing ... the taste was spot on.  Loaded with kale, noodles, avocado, mango and a chili-lime dressing, I could probably eat that once a week and not get sick of it.  My only gripe is that I got it with shrimp, which were inside the salad, with their tails on.  =/  If your going to put shrimp in something, the tails should be off.  I don't wanna put my fingers in my salad pulling off tails.  The drink menu is good, lots of wine, nice beer selection.  Mixed drinks are fairly priced.  I was here with a group of 8 and on a week night it was fairly easy to get a reservation. My group also enjoyed the carbonara, gnocchi with short ribs, cauliflower grits ... the charred brussel sprouts were good, but a tad too charred for some at our table.  The salted chocolate chip cookies with chocolate milk was a big hit for dessert.  I would definitely eat here again though based on that salad alone.  If in the area, happy hour here would be great too!",

Literally everything from the bruschetta to the Gnocchi & short ribs, then cookies were mouth watering and full of flavor. Gnocchi and Short ribs with grilled cheese is simply amazing. Cooked to perfection and so many flavored in every bite made this lunch fantastic. Bruschetta was cooked to perfection and also mouth watering. My friend has the crab cake entree and he too said it was fantastic. Prices seem pretty normal for this type of food, presentation and amount of food so I was extremely pleased. I will definitely be coming here again and recommend that if you haven't been yet you REALLY need to try it. 5 stars all the way and some!!!!!",

As a big fan of Grassroots Tap & Kitchen I was excited to take my mother, wife, and two kids to try out it's new sister restaurant Twisted Grove for Mother's Day.  This is no Grassroots Tap.  At best maybe an evil step-sister.  Nothing came out hot or even warm.  Everything we ordered ranged from room temperature to downright cold when it hit the table.  That is what made it to the table as not everything we ordered actually arrived.  Despite our dinner we WERE going to order some dessert to celebrate the holiday.  That never happened as the bill arrived and was dropped on the table without asking whether or not we wanted dessert or how our we liked the dinner.  This place has a lot of work ahead of it to be acceptable.  No thanks.",

The Brussel Sprouts got my attention and the Cauliflower Grits pulled me in the door.  The food did not disappoint.  Brussel sprouts were crispy goodness, Cauliflower was creamy goodness.  Also got the Cobb Salad and ended with the sweetened Ricotta/Cherry Compot/Buttermilk biscuit Crisp.  The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.  And for all of this the price was VERY REASONABLE.  I'd highly recommend going.  They've only been open for about 3 or 4 months, but the food felt well thought out and very tasty.  if you are in the area make a trip here, I think you will be happy you did.",

I read a number of reviews and decided to meet there. The building is spacious and very warm.  Large booths and the staff was very friendly.  We started off with their build your own bloody mary. Several different types of olives to choose from and other items but had I tasted the bacon before I went back to the booth I would have cleaned out the jar.  It was amazing.  We asked the waitress her suggestions so she named several but when she said Crab Cakes she didn't need to say another word. All 4 of us ordered the crab cakes.  It's not lumb crab it's more shredded but it's all crab with just a little binding and a light coating. My cousin who is from NY said it was the best he's ever had. We were there visiting for two hours and never once did we feel rushed. If we are ever back in that neck of the woods we will definitely go back.",

    "text": "OMG - best place ever!!! Service at the bar was wonderful, as Joseph was our bartender.  He was attentive and very helpful when he found out this was our first time here. He helped us during happy hour and pointed out the specials and great food values.  Tried the brussels sprouts and they were great - bacon makes everything better and the balsamic reduction was awesome. Ventured onto the short rib gnocchi and thought we had died and gone to heaven!  Tried the oysters, they were the large variety and nothing to brag about.... Joseph the bartender definitely helped elevate our experience - also try the fish tacos at happy hour - in house made pickled onions on them - sounds weird but delicious!!!",

Initially gave this place four stars but updating to a five since I have tried a few new things.  Prime rib sliders are amazing (this coming from someone who normally won't touch prime rib), as is the Angry Bird Flatbread and the crab cakes.  I didn't think the bruschetta or mushroom pasta was anything to write home about.   As for drinks, the Fleur de Lis has become my favorite drink in town.  The Paloma was good (fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, but could not taste any alcohol).  The Collins tasted like vodka soda with a splash of lemon if you like that kind of thing (I prefer a little more fruit flavor).",

Very pleased. I would have given it 5 stars if our server had been a bit more experienced. She was very sweet though. I ordered 2 raw oysters but sent them back because they were too small. They were $2.50 a piece. So I guess they were worth the price. We got a gift certificate for a free scoop of ice cream at the store down the block. Every table got this. I think it was called Sweet P's? Great ice cream. What a nice touch to end the meal.",

Somehow being alone in a busy restaurant with good food gives me the reflection-time I crave after especially stressful days at work.    If you're lucky enough to get there in time for happy hour, spoil yourself with the oysters! You won't be disappointed. They are fresh and shucked right in front of you. It is not the weird Arizona--seafood?? feeling that I find sometimes at other establishments, these are fresh and delicious and make me happy when I can get there in time.   I vary between the crab cake and salmon with Cesar salad, though I've experimented with most items on the menu. It is just an easy feel-good salad, order the small and you'll be satisfied without being overly stuffed. Again, these options are fresh and delicious seafood options, you can taste the quality in the first bite.   My favorite bartender is Stacey, she is super sweet.  She is the perfect bartender who knows how to chat while still taking cues if I'm not quite in the mood or busy flipping through work emails.   The cocktails are wonderful, the crowd is always happy, and the service is always spot-on. I'm so lucky to live nearby!",

The short ribs were so tender and the sauce was very good. I thought the entree was very filling though and my friend felt the same way about hers.   They also have really good cocktails here and the service was really good. They have a brunch menu as well as happy hour. I'd come back to try some other items!",

No line, no waiting just friendly service. Our server Tristyn was super.   The kids had some awesome breakfast meal with ice cream soaked French toast. Doesn't that just sound like heaven.  I had the cowboy hash. I didn't know breakfast could be this good.  Refills on fresh orange juice and lemonade. We even got a card for a free scoop of ice cream at Sweet provisions.  Hands-down one of my top five breakfast ever!  As if the great food and service weren't enough, I turn my head and what did I see, Notorious B.I.G. on the wall paper. Mind blown",

The lobster roll lives up to the coleslaw and the fries are awesome too.  There are so many yummy options I want to go back and try them all.  I also had the blueberry smash cocktail and it was also awesome!  It was refreshing with just the right amount of sweet.  I could easily knock a few of those out enjoying some time on the patio!

My husband got the salmon which was cooked to perfection - the brocolini was over cooked.

Then we ordered appetizers for our first appetizer we ordered the charred brussel sprouts just the presentation alone was absolutely beautiful to the eye. Then we also ordered the bruschetta board which comes with a variety of different choices and you get to pick 3 out of the many choices that they have to offer, my three choices where the Jammin spicy tomato, the goat cheese, and the candy pecans. Talk about amazing and delicious to the taste buds I was fully fully impressed with this place, I will definitely be back here again.",

Tristan was also super sweet and got us a free Creme de Leche cake for my bf's birthday. She recommended checking out other locally owned spots Wally's and Grassroots which we definitely will! Very open and a great wine/beer/cocktail selection. Not many know about their brunch they offer but Erica said dinner is busiest so maybe call for reservations. Will definitely be back, thanks Twisted Grove!",

We were resting on our laurels from last year and decided to crush unbelievably large portion sizes and exercise extreme gluttony.  I'm glad we chose Twisted Grove.  My only negative quip was the service.  You could tell it was a bit unorganized, but they eventually ironed everything out and finished strong.  Mealtime:   C1 - We started with the Brussels.  Roasted and tossed in a balsamic reduction, served with sugar cured bacon and an elegant plating that probably makes the staff nervous.  Perfecto.  C2 - The prime.  A succulent steak served with a horseradish aioli and mashed potatoes.  I'm an Idaho boy, so I love me some mashers.  This entree was melt in your mouth hole certified.  C3 - Pecannnnnnn pie.  What a nice treat.  I was 4 cocktails deep and started forgetting things, but did I mention they made a hell of an Old Fashioned?  I'll be back, you can count on it.",

Both were very good, crab cakes could have been seared a bit more to give a crispier outer layer, but the roasted cauliflower with tahini side was best she ever tasted.  Creamed spinach side also very good.  The short rib gnochi was fabulous with plenty of meat and a balanced amount of pasta with a great dark sauce and a variety of veggie and spice bits mixed in.  Had the caramel pecan pie which was good but not as wonderful as the name implied.  Overall a very nice dining experience and I would recommend it.",

Three things make us give it only 3 stars: the food was only room temp when it got to the table, they turned off the misters though it was warmer than when we arrived, and it was ridiculously loud as the music volume was way high.  The table next to us complained, too, but the waitress said the owner doesn't allow for any adjustments.  Won't be back. Too many places with good food in Scottsdale.",

Impeccable service down to the tiniest detail, incredible food that makes you salivate at every bite, and an intense atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Each and everyone of my needs were met, and one of the bussers (Peter) was very accommodating to my several tedious requests. Definitely get the Mushroom and Bourssin Flatbread, so good. Also, make sure you inquire about desserts - as they were fantastic. Just woah, I am utterly speechless.",

We used to go to this location when it was a great BBQ place; but now it is totally changed.  Some yelpers complained about the price.  I thought it was pretty right for 2016!  Portions were just fine.  I liked that they had two sizes of salads and that they were also delish!  Last time I had a flat bread with mixed cheeses and a variety of sauteed mushrooms.  It was so big, I brought half home and actually ate it the next day!  I usually don't eat left overs and end up throwing them out.  Not this time.  As far as service, they are weak with their hostess or host.  however; we had Maya, and she was nice, adorable and a good attentive server.  For a lite lunch or lite dinner, I think in it's category of casual restaurants, it is excellent and would not hesitate to recommend it! I almost forgot to mention that their parmesan fries are fresh, crispy and excellent!  They came with my husband's club sandwich, which might have been the best one he's ever eaten!  I agree.  It just worked!",

I had an absolutely wonderful salad with noodles, avocado, mango, shrimp, and more. It was very unusual and I could have eaten a double-bowl of it!  My only complaint is that they don't have a website. I asked for and was given a card, but both the website and the phone number on it were not good. I know they just opened so I won't hold that against them, but they need to have an accurate Internet presence pretty soon. I eat lunch with several other people and was dying to show them the menu, but it's nowhere on-line ... yet.   I will definitely go to this restaurant again.",

    "text": "I have been to Twisted Grove 4 times in the last month. First stopped in looking for a place to have a near future Birthday Happy Hour (3-6) at. Was hoping it would be good and I was not disappointed! My bartender Joseph was super welcoming and knowledgeable with the drink menu. I had given wine up for Lent and was looking for a beer comparable to Kiltlifter. He knew exactly which beer to suggest for me (Abita amber) and it was yummy and ice cold. I had the Tri-tip sliders off the Happy Hour menu. The meat was shaved thin and melted in your mouth. Awesome on the toasted pretzel roll. After a few beers, I also sampled the zucchini chips. Thin, crispy and like a certain potato chip, you can't eat just one. I decided right then that my Birthday party would be here. I texted everyone as I sipped my last beer. On my 2nd recon visit (gotta try some other items to recommend to my friends-don't I?) Reggie took good care of me. I had the Bruschetta and so should you. It is hands down the best I have ever eaten. You get to pick 3 from the selection of 5. I had the ricotta with cherry jam, the one with burrata, candied bacon and crispy onion strings and for the third it was goat cheese, dates, candied walnuts and a little honey. The bread they use is absolutely perfect for bruschetta. Nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside. All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Could not leave without trying the charred Brussels sprouts. OMG! Charring them brings out such depth.  Pairing it with a few bits of candied bacon is brilliant and then you get a little tang from the balsamic reduction. It just makes your mouth say \"Wow, more please!\". Now it's Birthday Happy Hour time! Got there right at 3 with my designated driver. By 4, we had about 10 people. Our waiter Tony was absolutely amazing! Separate checks was not a problem at all for him. Never once saw him write anything down. Had it all perfect. Since some people had arrived sooner than others we were all of different time schedules as far as who was ordering food and who needed another drink. Tony never missed a beat and we never went thirsty or hungry! Thanks, Tony! Everybody loved everything. Lent being over I was able to sample the wine menu. Love the Roth Cabernet. Tried a different bruschetta this time. Sounded a little strange since I had never seen anything like it. Avocado, pickled onion, cilantro and jalapeno? Not a fan of raw onions but I love me some Mexican flavors so why not try it? Another OMG! The creaminess of the avocado with the cilantro and the bite of the jalapeno on the toasted bread was outstanding. I even very much liked the thin pickled onion. Who knew? We tried some other items off the regular menu (salads, pepper glazed goat cheese, parmesan-garlic frittes, hot coco, tres leches cake) and they were all great.  The last time I was there it was more beer and bruschetta. This time 2 avocado ones and 1 burrata and candied bacon. More excellent service. Thanks, Kimmy for your special help. Actually starting to get a little hungry now. Been thinking about trying the sausage and onion flatbread for a while now. Cocktail hour is not too far away...... and from where I live neither is The Twisted Grove! Think I'm going to finish my chores and head on over.",

It's been sad watching restaurant after restaurant fail in this space so really hope this one takes.  The ambiance and food are perfect so hope it's a home run for them.

Twice I was served a ginger beer with something colorful in it. First glass had something red. Second glass had something orange. We made fun of how it appeared to be crawling, hopefully from the carbonation. But, if a drink is sent back because the customer saw something it it try to make sure the second one is clean. Just sayin!",

We got cocktails, the bruschetta board & the crispy fish tacos. For the bruschetta board, we got the burrata, avocado & goat cheese. Our favorite was definitely the avocado bruschetta, it was bursting with flavor and extremely tasty. Each piece of bruschetta is cut into 3 large pieces, so you're getting a lot out of each kind. The bread was toasted perfectly and was crispy & soft at the same time. Perfectly done.   Really looking forward to returning here for dinner in the future, it's a great new addition to the Scottsdale dining scene!",

BTW, the restaurants interior is very well put together. Patio has misters and shade screens to block the sun. It was hot (what you would expect summer to feel like) but with the shade and misters it made the patio feel nice and comfortable, but probably to hot for some, you know who you are.  The food looked and smelled fantastic. We were not in the mood for meat that evening so we ordered all vegetarian dishes. They had enough to feed a table of four. Needless to say, everything we ordered was delicious which made us not even miss the meat.  I would definitely go back with my significant other or as a group. The atmosphere seemed fun and a good place to have some drinks with your mates. I would give it five stars but I've only been there once and I think it takes a few times to really know a place, so who knows, maybe next time my rating will change.",

The short rib & gnocchi is simply the best I think I've ever had anywhere , the only problem was there was not enough of it with my delicious short rib that was cooked to perfection! My husband had the French dip that looked delicious and my picky kids loved theirs so it's a win all around. Plus did I mention kids eat free from 2-6 as well as they have a great happy hour. The kids meal menu has a great selection and comes with a scoop of ice cream next door at the most adorable ice cream parlor with great service.

Both dishes were good, the pizza was more memorable. Inside the place is really nice, upscale & they wait on you well. Inside a strip mall, but isolated it's cool place. They have plenty of room & they keep the air conditioning cold. I wasn't blown away by anything but everything was good, from the food to the ambiance to the service, all in all I'd say they earn a pretty solid 4 star. It could cost you a few bucks to go here it isn't a cheap option. This place is nice enough for a date, but also good for families, a work luncheon, basically all of the above check them out if in Scottsdale. Happy eating",

The cook went to town on making sure they were charred super well!! Too charred for my taste, sorry!!!  On the flip side, the short rib with ricotta gnocchi was an absolute hit! The short rib was nicely tender & had an abundance of flavor. It was just slightly salty, but the flavor in each bite took me to another dimension that I soon forgot any bit of saltiness. The gnocchi had just the right touch of soft doughy chewiness and was an excellent complement to the short rib!  The oreo cookie cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake was the perfect ending to a fabulous meal. Wish I took some pics, but when the cakes came out, we all had our forks ready and there was no stopping us!   We were there for a friend's bday and our waiter was kind enough to comp the cheesecake for us! Thank you for a lovely dinner; I'll be back!!!",

Literally, if you look up the tips for this place, you will see my happy mug there. But you get the gist of tipping that I am referencing. Twisted Grove is a perfect brunch choice or in most cases, my fave place for lunch meetings. How have I not gushed about you??  Staff is always friendly despite its bustle of regular patrons, myself included. I used to come at least three times a week when I lived in the area, but good thing my office is close and this is my go-to for client entertaining. The front entry is cheerful and you can be a do-gooder and donate a book. You're welcome to snag a good one too.  I prefer to snag a seat at the bar and chat up with the staff. Where should I begin on what you should choose? It would end up being longer than some trilogy. I am a big fan of appetizers and the presentation of the charred brussels sprouts is in itself so inviting. Bits of bacon can be pretty persuasive. I will admit I am a creature of habit because I am in love with the Caesar salad with grilled steak and open egg, no dressing. Trust me, you'll thank me for your gains. If somehow, I managed to venture differently, the sunny cobb is bound to make your belly happy. The unexpected sweet fried onions and moist chicken make this salad an entree. Another top candidate is the cowboy style two potato hash. I want to wake up to the world every day if I could devour this for breakfast daily. If it is on menu and in season, order the crab/lobster Mac'n'cheese because who wouldn't? Weekends are popular here, as well as the holidays when pie orders go in. Plan early for a pumpkin or pecan pie for sure.  Last but not least, always first on my list, their starlight is the dessert menu. If it's on the menu, I have probably had it three to four times to be exact. I am unwilling to share the Tres Leches and pretty much will break the golden rule of sharing. There are simply no words to describe this uhmazing piece of heaven, other than my pictures. Try it and you will understand. That creaminess and milky goodness is not to be found elsewhere. I certainly believe the fresh berries somehow deflect the calories. Again, have you not seen the pictures? Anyone can be the type that works out and loves dessert. Never ever skip dessert.   I will return for brunch, lunch, dinner, you name it and I'm going to be eating here. A very happy face makes for a very happy belly. All I can say is, I stinkin adore you Twisted Grove. You have my heart.",

I had a Caesar salad and French dip with fries.  The roast beef was sliced thin and piled high. Just the right hint of horseradish, and the au jus was perfect.  Fries nice and crispy.    We ordered dessert - I shared the tres leches cake and the butterscotch pecan pie. Both were amazing- one was light and fluffy, the other dense and delicious.    You must try there Rose 76 beverage.  Bombay, sparkling Rose - a perfect refresher.    Really happy!  I will be back, and I live 65 miles away!",

Social, spacious and a little loud, but not overly. Great layout, big bar, tables and booths all around.  Service: both times our service was great. Attentive and friendly. Knowledgeable and social. Okay, after the place closed and we were still there, it was tough to even get a water refill, but, we had been there for several hours. And, it was very odd that on a Saturday night this place closed at 10pm. Pretty early. Once the staff was cleaning, they were on a mission to get out of there. No points off for this, just odd.  Food: here's where they really shine. They have a great selection of drinks!! Tons of choices and all of them seem like they're made with the highest quality fresh ingredients and really inventive, unique blends. We tried several and all were stellar! Then the food; wide selection including appetizers. We lived the apps so much we actually ordered a second round of them! The roasted Brussels sprouts with thick cut maple bacon were unreal!! The second order hit the spot!! The guys both ordered the short ribs and house made gnocchi, unbelievable!! So rich and thick, tender and delicious!! The girls both ordered the soba noodle salad, one shrimp and one chicken. Super fresh, perfectly cooked and spiced. All the meals were plentiful and made with care and fresh ingredients. Food is a good value at just over $15 per person and great drinks are about $10 each.  Overall this place is great! It's a bit odd that they own the restaurant next door and I didn't like it at all. But Twisted Grove is excellent. I recommend it and look forward to a third visit, worth the drive in my opinion.",

My only gripe was that the special of the day was described as swordfish with green beans and instead I received swordfish with a cold beet and goat cheese side with crushed cashews and balsamic which I didn't find appetizing, and for $35 it was a bit disappointing they didn't share the market price with me or serve what was described.    Apparently the artichokes were a huge hit! We will still be back!",

Tender meat, exquisite gnocchi and beautiful, creamy sauce. So satisfying. I paired mine with the Broccolini & Green Goddess side. Perfect together.

Sat at the bar and was greeted quickly by the bartender who took my order. Bloody Mary came quickly and was very good. That's where it stops. A buddy of hers sat down next to me and while she had plenty of time to chat with him, my drink sat empty for 25 minutes. I was literally right in front of her and she never glanced over. It's not my job to flag a bartender down, especially when the bar was barely half full. I had to eventually flag her down for the check - she brought it and dropped it. No thank you or anything.

The patio outside looks really nice, there's a fireplace and they allow dogs. Joseph our bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. I would call it sophisticated comfort food. The chef has creative ideas and I'll have a hard time deciding what to have when we go back. We also had the tres leches cake which was amazing!",

Service has been superb at lunch and dinner.  I will have to give my nod to the crab cakes as being my favorite.  Outside of Maryland these are the best I have had.  My recommendation would be to get the salad with the crab, because the entree is two cakes so you better think about sharing it is so much food.  The bruschetta board is a must.  You definitely want to same some space for desert that can be as novel as it comes...........chocolate milk and cookies; seriously.  The wine list is adequate with some very nice selections.  I think any but the most ardent wine snob would find something very acceptable to enjoy.  This is probably my favorite Common Ground property.",

The Asian Noodle salad with steak was phenomenal... an explosion of flavor. The brussel sprouts app was better than I ever thought they could be. The decor and setting of the restaurant is very well done. Another success for the Collins family!",

Amazing take on new American cuisine this place is definitely worth checking out and not only for the amazing vibe! I'd highly suggest starting with one of their homemade shandys or cocktails then either the brussel sprout or artichoke apps. We had the lamb chops and chicken carbonara (pasta's all made in house btw) and they were to die for... Don't miss the chance to try out this cool new spot!",

We have tried many things on the menu but the flat bread with borson cheese and mushrooms and the bruschettas stand out the most ! The only reason I'm  giving 4 stars is because one experience there ( on my husbands birthday ) was not pleasant . They brought us out sides and never brought us our  entrees and server took a long time to acknowledge anything . But  it was also super busy and it was a very new resteraunt , and they were vey apologetic and made up for it . Other than that it's a great place to go for some good apps and has good environment !",

Not your average presentation, with it's large pieces of dates and other fresh ingredients yet it is hands down the most refreshing bite of salad I've had in a long time. The artichokes are amazing and I wish I would have ordered more. The brussel sprouts are a top seller and the rustic presentation, crisp textured sprouts and sweet bacon confirm why. If I lived on Scottsdale I would go here all the time!",

We sat on the patio which seems to accommodating no matter the temp. Brussel sprouts for an app, cliche yes but these were prob the best ones i've had. I had the pork chop which was cooked med ish without having to ask. This is a good thing. Juicy and flavorful. They even had straight horseradish which I add to many pork and beef. They are vegan and gluten free accommodating, fyi. Desert I had these canoli waffles which were delicious, and the ricotta (i think) with cherries. This was the shit! Go here, chill and have a great meal for a decent price. You won't leave feeling lethargic either.",

The server we had was pretty good, however because they were busy, he didn't check up on us enough.  I also was a little irked that he said he would bring us out a complimentary appetizer (queso fundido) and then charged us for it.  Bottom line: I'd like to go again to try other dishes and order the avocado bruschetta and mushroom pasta again.    Oh the roasted cauliflower side & parmesan fries are also really good.",

He was very friendly and informative / helpful on all the menu items.  We started off with the oysters in a half shell.  Very tasty and the cocktail/horseradish sauce that came with it was perfect in flavor.  I got the Carlsbad chicken sandwich.  It was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Also, got the cauliflower grits which were to die for....loved it!!!  My one friend got the grilled eggplant sandwich with creamed spinach.  She said the sandwich was ok.  Couldn't really taste the eggplant and the cheese was a little overwhelming. The creamed spinach was good.  My other friend got the gnocchi & short ribs.  He absolutely loved it. I tried it and it was amazing.  The gnocchi was cooked perfect and the short ribs just melted in your mouth.    Our overall experience was very enjoyable and pleasant.  We look forward to coming back soon.",

In queried where the crab came from as I heard many restaurants are using crab from Asian country. This was from the gulf. Excellent, served with a small side salad. Excellent and flavorful caesar salad and the flat bread with sausage and onion strings on the top is the best. Just remember to order it without the dandelion greens on top ( they call it frazee) Service is excellent and is a team type concept, anyone on the wait team who is available helps you.

    "text": "Love grassroots,  so decided to try out twisted grove. Was disappointed to say the least.  Started with brussel sprouts, and they were delicious.  Others at my table complained they were burnt,  but I thought they were just crispy enough.   Main courses  were marginal at best.  Wife ordered the short ribs and gnocchi. Gnocchi was good,  but short ribs were lacking flavor. I had the roasted chicken with stuffing and grits. Stuffing was delicious,  but chicken left a lot to be desired.  Portion was very healthy,  but one piece of the chichen was extremely dry. This was not a one off as another person at the table ordered the chicken and had the same problem.  He also ordered a side grilled cheese sandwich at the servers recommendation,  which he prompted was the best part of his meal (@$3). His wife had the crab cakes, and as other reviewers have said,  were delicious (disclaimer: I didn't try) -and these were one of the most expensive dishes at $29. My dining companion did mention to the server that the chicken was dry and didn't eat it and the server responded \"did you want me to tell someone about it? \", to which my companion responded \"I just thought that you should know\". And for full disclosure,  I did eat all of my chicken as I was starving,  and I don't typically complain unless the food was atrocious.  In this case,  just not good.  It would have been nice to at least get a manager table touch,  or been offered an apology for our mediocre meals. Considering we spent around $200 last night on dinner (with booze), you'd think the manager would at least come check on the table.   Dissappointing. From now on,  we'll stick to grassroots.",

We went with all of his suggestions and were very pleased with each. First, we tried three of the bruschettas and each one was even better than the next, though I have to say, the bacon and arugula was my favorite. We also got a small plate of twisted oysters. Even if oysters don't appeal to you, the spinach, relish, and dressing atop the broiled oysters made this dish so flavorful and appetizing.  The twisted noodle salad with steak was a refreshing and interesting plate like nothing I've had before. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium, as ordered. Our table also loved the crab cakes, which were meaty and delicately prepared with a side of coleslaw and crispy fries. My favorite side was the cauliflower grits. They were unlike anything I've had before and added a new twist to a classic dish. For dessert, the cookies were a perfect balance of sweet and salty. The only thing that would have made them better is a bowl of vanilla ice cream!   After our superb dining experience last night, we are ordering take out from the Twisted Grove tonight! I can't wait to try everything else on the menu! 5 stars all around!",

While the food was very good, with the exception of the stale chips served with the hummus plate, our service could not have been worse. Our greeting at the front was just meh, and when our server came by to take our drink order and we asked for her recommendation for which was their best buttery chardonnay (as their wine menu is extensive) her response was \"I don't know\" followed by nothing. Not a, let me ask the bartender or would you like to try a taste of something. We had to ask her to talk to the bartender. When she came back to our table, she put a glass of wine down on the side of the table and walked away - no comment about what it was!!! Why was she so put off by such a simple question??? Thankfully a very nice server came by and took over our table. While we thought our visit had been salvaged by this new server, it was soured once we finished our dinner and were constantly hounded by different server after server if they could \"get us anything else\"....literally 4 different servers came by in a matter of 10 minutes trying to usher us out of there, and we still had our wine to finish.   I may give this place one more shot as any restaurant can have a bad night, but will cautiously recommend to my friends.",

It was followed by your choice of  baby back ribs, ahi tuna  salad and a rotisserie chicken entree.  The meal was toppled off with a chocolate brownies and ice cream and Tres Les Leches..  The back room is hooked up with a large screen to exhibit photos or movies to reminisce one's childhood and dating memories, so as to share with your guests.  The service was top notch and the owner, Chris Collins was there to oversee the celebration and to offer added service if needed. Very warm and an intimate atmosphere for a small group gathering......Thanks to the entire staff for creating a lovely memory for our entire family............K",

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is a very slow bar....if you plan on a drink with an appetizer and another with the meal, better order both up front....more timely service there would put it over the top!",

    "text": "I'm not sure why I haven't written a review for this place yet even though it is one of my favorite restaurants. My boyfriend and a few of our friends absolutely love the bruschetta board and the sweet & spicy margaritas. We had gone hiking prior to visiting today and drinking did not sound like a good idea because I felt dehydrated. Anyway, our main go-to's for the bruschetta are the ones that include: mascarpone, burrata, and goat cheese. The one with mascarpone, walnuts, fig and arugula is my absolute favorite. It is almost like a dessert!   I'm a big fan of crab cakes and this place knows what they are doing with it! Also, they just started serving brunch and we tried the Eggs in Purgatory this afternoon - So delicious! We would definitely order it again! It was such a comforting dish and it would be perfect for anyone with a hangover. Maybe we will go again tomorrow :)  Anyway, we left an envelope there during our visit and didn't realize it until a few hours later. The manager, Richard, was SO HELPFUL. He definitely provided outstanding customer service. I can't believe how far he went to find us that envelope. He went through surveillance footage and went dumpster diving for us. Who does that??? Well, Richard did that and we are so thankful. The oysters are good, the grilled cheese board is yummy, and I really enjoy the tri-tip sandwich. I heard the owner of this place is also the owner of Grassroots, which is in the same shopping center. We frequent there for lobster bisque on Fridays and I love getting the farmer's chop salad with salmon at Grassroots.   My boyfriend and I went to dinner at a steakhouse to celebrate our anniversary tonight. Unfortunately, we did not really enjoy our meal tonight at BLT Steak. We left early and just came back home to relax after a long day. I don't know why we didn't think to just come back to Twisted Grove tonight for our special evening. We screwed up. We would have had a much better meal and better time.   Long story short, I recommend Twisted Grove to anyone. The GM Richard went above and beyond for us and we definitely appreciated it. We are more than happy with this place.   Now go get yourself a Sweet & Spicy margarita.",

    "text": "This was one of our last dinners while visiting Scottsdale and it was very much worth it. First off this restaurant had an amazing atmosphere and comfort to it. The servers are genuine and seem to really value and care for their customers.   But the food...the food is the reason to come. Absolutely delicious. We started with the Brussel sprouts and artichoke hearts. Both were played interestingly and the flavors were on point. Cooked well and paired with delicious sauces and other ingredients. The Brussel sprouts were definitely our favorite appetizer out of the two.  For the main items, the table ordered the crab cakes, pork chop, gnocchi & short ribs, and one of the specials that night: cavatelli with meatballs. All of the dishes were extremely fresh and full of flavor. The crab cakes were cooked well and did not have a strong fishy flavor like some do. The special was really good and was a very large portion.  Overall this restaurant was really good, offered lots of options and had reasonable prices for the quality of food that you are receiving.",

    "text": "This review is for a visit on Monday, January 16:  This was our first happy hour at Twisted Grove. We arrived at about 5 PM and were able to order enough food and drinks to satisfy us for lunch and dinner - we had skipped lunch!  The server Chelsea, was very pleasant and accommodating. When I ordered the Boulevard, I believe it was called, which is the closest thing to a Manhattan I asked if I could have a Luxardo cherry instead of a regular one and she said no problem. The drink came out a little too frothy for my liking but it tasted great.  For food we ordered the roasted brussels sprouts - the must-have and everyone knows how good they are...yes, they really are that good. We also had one prime rib slider each (very tender and flavorful prime rib, with just a little too much horseradish on the soft and buttery brioche bun.)  The caramelized onion and sausage pizza was shockingly a white flatbread with no tomato sauce and quite a nice surprise at that. The flatbread had a very puffy and light dough above the crispy surface and the nicely browned caramelized onions were sweet and flavorful, it also had crispy fried onions much like the kind on green bean casseroles! The sausage was nearly nonexistent maybe for the eight slices we had eight small pieces. We also shared the picnic chicken which was the least interesting of all but still very tasty with the tender crust, slightly spicy sauce and moist chicken meat. The sauce, angry bird sauce on the tables is absolutely fantastic. It is smoked Fresno chilies ground up with brown sugar vinegar and probably a little salt and pepper. It is a perfect balance of hot and flavor with only a touch of smoke, nothing like chipotle which is overbearing in the smoke department.  There are so many items on the menu we want to try that we will happily return for more happy hours!  The review below is for February 2016: It was not crowded on a Sunday night. This was our first visit and we liked the appearance of the communal tables in the large open bar area.  One of us had several of the side dishes as an entree - the broccolini and the cauliflower grits. Both are very tasty. The Asian noodle salad and a slightly spicy dressing and was very refreshing. The crab cake salad was awfully small for $17 - one crabcake and a small pile of greens. Not a good value whatsoever.   The whole place has a very pleasant vibe and we look forward to returning and trying additional dishes.",

The sides that accompany this are the best part, though: loaded mashed potatoes and a out-of-this-world stuffing. I would be delighted to go eat this again tonight!

My time working for him did not end well and I moved on with a pretty negative opinion of him. That being said, I absolutely loved this place. When we arrived on a Friday night, they were busy. Our server was tied up with other tables but the manager was at our table right away to get drink and appetizer orders, great teamwork. When our server, Tegan was free to come and say hi, she was charming and friendly, as well as patient with one of our party who was having a hard time making up his mind about dinner. The artichoke appetizer and our drinks arrived and all was delicious. Our entrees, mushroom pappardelle, short rib and gnocchi, and cavatelli carbonara were outstanding, as well as the tres leches cake we had for dessert. The food was excellent, the service was superior, and this is coming from someone who walked in ready to be very critical and maybe a little biased. Excellent job done by a very well trained staff. Congratulations Chris, you've done an amazing job.",

We split the pecan pie which is totally different than any other pecan pie we have ever had. It has a custard like filling. It was really good.   My only knock is that our waitress was not attentive to us. We had to ask another waitress to refill my wife's ice tea and at the end of our meal we had to ask another waitress to put in our order for dessert.

What got me was after I paid I realized two things. the side that was served with my entree was too Smokey (from the bacon they said) and I got charged for the side dish that they swapped it out for. As well, we ordered i believe two of each of the desserts listed on their menu, which I think four were listed. one of the desserts that was on the menu was not available so It was swapped with one of the other desserts. And I guess there was a special for the desserts (which we were not told about) so they served us two of the specials in addition to the desserts we ordered. Thus in all we got several dessert items we did not order. We were not asked if that would be ok, we were just served Them and charged for them.  I'm surprised or maybe even a bit dismayed they took such liberties and advantage of us. Maybe Bc they knew our tab was going to be large and a few extra charges might go unnoticed.   their appetizers are far better than their entrees.",

It's been even longer since I was super happy with the money spent for a meal out!  Twisted Grove, you've impressed. Joseph, our server, was fabulous. His recommendations were spot on, we all ordered from his list. And, his service was paramount.   The gnocchi with short ribs, crab cake, twisted noodle salad & tres leches cake are all highly recommended!  We will be back!",

    "text": "Not impressed! I know it's early and they still need to work out a few kinks.  We sat at the bar and it was fairly busy and was tough to get the bartenders attention which took about 10 minutes. Ordered our drinks, still waiting.....10 minutes later the bartender says \"what did you order again?\" Oh brother, in for a long night! Finally he brings us our cocktails, this is no mixologist and felt like this guy was just out of bartending school. At $9 each, the cocktails were pretty poor and not well prepared. Tasted like a college kid made them.  Food: order bruschetta which was quite good 4/5. Lots too from but were out of one that we wanted, yet what we did get was a B+.  Short ribs: while they were very good and served over pillowy gnocchi which was excellent, at $17 it literally was the size of a small appetizer. Had 3 very small pieces of short rib totaling no more than 3oz and only a few gnocchi. This was a joke. Even though was well prepared I would never order that again.  Salmon: very good, cooked a perfect medium again at $23 for a really small portion over a bit of kale salad. It's just too pricey for what you get.  Overall..go next door to Grassroots! It's better quality, service and priced accordingly. Hope Twisted makes the necessary adjustments and it will be successful. Not sure if I would come back at this point.",

They suggested we try their sister restaurant - which led us to Twisted Grove. We were sat immediately and service was prompt. The entire staff was great as we had two waitresses and one or two serves for our party.  I ordered the Twisted Noodle Salad - and it was to die for! Mangoes, cashews, and steak all in one salad? Yes please! It was SLIGHTLY over dressed - but I still can't complain as I ate every last piece. Others in my party ordered the salmon, grouper sandwich, Cobb salad, crab cake salad, and a flat bread and everyone raved about how good their dish was.  I would definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Another solid concept from the creator of Grassroots Kitchen and Tap. The menu offers solid options from both land and sea, and drawls for the masses. If you have been to this location in the past (Spotted Donkey, and more recently Scottsdale Station), it will be easy to recognize how much better the space is being utilized by Twisted. Plenty of booths, tables, and bar space give this well lit space a welcoming vibe. The patio, although west facing, is a great place to enjoy a dozen oysters and a pint before catching a spring training game right down the street.   We dined around 7:15, and the place was popping. Considering the restaurant had just opened a few weeks before, the service was on par. The owner, GM, and service manager all did quality checks on our table to ensure we were having an enjoyable dining experience. This is something many restaurants fail to do, and it shows the quality of restaurant service the owner has established throughout his other locations.   Our tables favorite items were the Crab Cakes (fuckin bomb), Twisted Noodle Salad, and the Pork Chop.   The wine and beer list is on point as well. Cocktails are very reasonably priced (especially during happy hour), and the house lemonades will surely quench your sober thirst.   If you can't find something on the menu that looks appealing, then you probably shouldn't eat out. Ever.",

    "text": "I was very impressed by the restaurant, the staff and the food. I found this place by chance after doing a Yelp search for restaurants that took reservations (Friday night and a babysitter, I wasn't going to waste my night waiting for a table to clear up at a restaurant). I've been by this place several times a week since it opened and never noticed it.  Since I had the opportunity for an all too rare date night with the hubs, I did a quick check of the menu and called the restaurant for a reservation.  We arrived a little early for our 7:30 reservation figuring we would have to wait, but we were surprised to be led right to our table.  We had about a 5 minute wait before we could order our drinks, but both our waitress and the bartender stopped by the table to let us know they would be right with us. It was refreshing!  I tried their Blueberry Smash and their White Cosmo, my hubs had the iced tea.  The smash was delish! Crisp and slightly sweet. The Cosmo probably would have been better if I hadn't had the smash first. It tasted a bit more tart than I think I was ready for after rum and fruit, but that was my fault.  It was very good, but I probably shouldn't have mixed flavors.  We ordered the Pepper Glazed Goat Cheese for an appetizer. I loved the bubbly goat cheese, but I wasn't a fan of the peppadew relish. It was too sweet for my taste, but I can see how the sharp of the goat cheese and the sweet of the relish would be wonderful for someone that likes that. My husband loved it.    While we were waiting for the appetizer, the hostess brought us complimentary roasted Brussels sprouts. Someone had ordered them and changed their mind and they didn't want them to go to waste. I had been talking about ordering them on the ride over, but since my hubs is not a fan of the sprouts we opted to look at another option. So this was a win-win for me. They were crispy, and so full of flavor.  I ended up dipping a few in the goat cheese (sans relish) and it was a little slice of heaven. There are big chunks of bacon and roasted garlic throughout and they were like little treasures to be found.  The hubs ordered the Gnocchi & Short Ribs. They were cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the rib meat was so tender it almost melted under the weight of the fork. He is already asking when we get to go back.  I had the crab cakes. They were seasoned well, but I wish there had been a smidgen more of the aioli. I was using it on both the crab cakes and the parm fries the dish comes with. YUM! The dish also comes with cole slaw, something I was not planning on liking as it is usually overdressed, mayonaisey or sweet. This one was perfect. Very lightly dressed, it had a nice tang and the cabbage was very crunchy and cold.   We also tried the Tres Leche cake on recommendation of both the hostess and our waitress. It was sinful. The salted caramel, which I'm usually not a big fan of, was perfect with the cool whipped cream and the hot cake. It was a balanced flavor sensation. Every tastebud had something to be excited about.  I would highly recommend this place. I would also recommend making a reservation if you are going to go on a Friday night. The place was packed, the bar was packed, and there was a couple who left the waiting area because there was a wait.   There is a patio I can't wait to sit on during a crisp fall evening, the bar has several TV's with sports (hubs was happy), and they have 2 private dining rooms for events.  I'm looking forward to a return visit.",

We had two appetizers, the bruschetta was varied in flavor, taste and texture ... very nice. I had a double order of oysters, cold and fresh like the ocean itself.  For entrees I had the Sea Bass and my GF ordered the crab cakes. I loved my bass and the spaghetti squash ... but her crab cakes were phenomenal, so moist and the crab was the star of the show with less emphasis on cake. I'm from Rhode Island, very picky on seafood ... Twisted Grove does a great job with fish.  About that teary eyed pregnant lady giving this place two stars. Twisted should get a hormone disclaimer on that one ... Sheesh.",

The good; Almost every menu choice has been really good, if not excellent. Caprese flat bread and garlic fries were awesome.   The bad: Totally can be fixed, but the blackened swordfish was overcooked, making it dry, and was seriously light on the blackening seasoning.  The ugly: Last night I ordered the crispy fish sandwich, for the 2nd time, and thought it was really pretty good. Both times I requested to have the cole slaw on the side, and both times it was served on the side. Last night I requested to also have my sandwich cut in half, same as last time. Here comes the ugly. The food was served, and my sandwich was a whole and not two halves. My server informed me that they no longer cut sandwiches in half. I was taken aback. I asked to talk to the manager. He came over, and made it clear, that without exception,   \"NO WE WON\"T CUT YOUR SANDWICH  IN HALF\"  C'mon now. Really? And the reason given was that it is a time issue. Saturday night at 7:30, with 50% of the restaurant empty seems like the manager would do anything to foster repeat business.    The bottom line - The restaurant graveyard is not too far away. It has already claimed Zen 32, Stella, and the Central Bistro. All in the same exact spot as Twisted Grove.   I will still go back, but only at someone else's request. For me, I'll pick a place with valet, or readily available parking, and a kitchen that will make the time to spend 4 seconds on cutting my sandwich in half!",

This space has seen many start and fail restaurants.   We started with the artichokes which were pure amazing.  I washed it down with the crab cakes and WOW I was very happy. I know that everyone was happy with dinner.   In to desert. Chocolate chunk cookies on a wood plank served with house made chocolate milk. Yep!!!",

We always have excellent customer service here-and Maya raised the bar.  She ensured my glass of bubbly was chilled to my liking when the first one was a tad warm.  We enjoyed the Bruschetta, Pork Sliders and Fish Tacos-all savory delights.  We love the spacious comfy booths next to the bar to enjoy the energy of the bar patrons but dine in comfort.  A fun, hip vibe with plenty of seating and one of the best Happy Hours in town.",

As we left the restaurant we were busy talking and I forgot my take home box and our server graciously brought it out to us.

First experience was a good one though it seemed like they were working out the kinks, servers and bar staff were bickering over how food should be delivered.  Overall the food was good, I had the Wild Mushroom Pappardelle and my wife had the Twisted Noodle Salad.  For our most recent visit, we brought my wife's sister.  I ordered the mushroom dish again, and they split the Twisted Noodle Salad and the Crab Cakes.  This time, my dish wasn't as great as the first visit, it was okay, but not something get again.  Too few mushrooms and the sauce left a weird after taste.  My wife and her sister had an entirely different experience they enjoyed their meal and agreed they would return, but they both got extremely ill the next morning.  When they tried to alert the restaurant the manager just told them, that no one else complained and didn't seem to care about their their experience.  Needless to say we cancelled our Valentines day reservations and will not be giving this place another chance.  It a shame because we also thought about to reserving their \"Boardroom\" for an upcoming event.  A little humility (and proper food handing) goes a long way.  By the way, I don't usually leave reviews and don't usually value one star reviews, but they deserved this one.",

The brussel sprouts are a must-have- perfect with bacon and garlic and balsalmic vinegar.    I had the gnocchi and short ribs, because every employee we asked, said it was the best dish.  It was!  the gnocchi were crispy on the outside, a new thing for me.  Very good.  The short ribs, to die for-- off the bone, very tender, and tons of meat.  My table mates had salmon and said it was excellent.  Service was perfect- attentive but not pushy, and fun to talk with as well.  I will be back!",

Although there were several empty tables that never got seated the entire time we were there we were told it would be 30 minuets wait for a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive but not very friendly. By that I mean she didn't smile or seem genuinely interested in giving us service we would rave about, she seemed content doing the bare minimum and was often occupied with what looking like closing and bar sticking duties. Her distraction cost her a few bucks because half way through our meal if she would have noticed our drinks had been empty for a while we would have ordered a second round but she never asked. The cocktails are really good. I like the flur de leis and my boyfriend enjoyed his martini. Bruschetta board was mediocre and the toast crust was inedible. The crab cake salad was yummy but over priced for the 6 lettuce leafs and tiny cake in an over sized bowl. I would go back for the short rib gnocchi but it will be a while!",

The brussels sprouts would be delicious but they were undercooked and made us um... uncomfortable inside. The short rib gnocchi was tasty, but in a deconstructed-beef-stew sort of way. Prettier than it was delicious. The carbonara is purportedly a staff favorite, but this tasted like overlooked little shells drowned in a flavorless sea of alfredo then (you guessed it) more undercooked Brussels sprouts scattered throughout. Overall tasted like a fancy Chili's. Not enthused.",

Unfortunately, we couldn't say the same about it this last time. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. There were hardly any mushrooms in it. Everything else was great. Lively atmosphere, great server. Maybe they were having an off night as far as this dish was concerned. Not sure that we would order it again. If we did, we would definitely say something to the server about about this last experience and ask to have the kitchen put more mushrooms in it, and take better care with the dish overall. Caesar salad was great. Cauliflower was great. Our friends's dishes were great. Maybe they were running out of mushrooms? If so, they should have taken the dish off the menu.",

It will certainly accommodate large parties, because the dining room is quite large for a neighborhood restaurant.   I like the food - the brisket is really good. And I like the happy hour menu. There are a decent amount of both food and drink options on the HH menu.  This isn't a place people dress high for, but I wouldn't wear casual shorts, either. Business casual is about right.  Unfortunately, every time I've ever eaten here, I've been overlooked or forgotten. The last time I visited, there were 3 people to serve me before my friends even arrived. I waited a while before I was offered water, and then nobody came soon thereafter to take my drink order (happy hour is on a time limit, after all!) Once someone did, it was a different person than who served the water, and yet different too from the person who took my food order.",

We hosted 13 people and had a select menu option prior to the event.  Our menu consisted of the wild mushroom pappardelle, rotisserie chicken entree and the Scottish salmon.  The majority of our clients chose the salmon.  The salmon was delicious.  The texture was just right and was accompanied by cauliflower and a spring salad (ordered as a side).  The salad was a spring mix, with carrots and robust tomatoes.  We dined on the chocolate mousse pie and the delightful yet light butterscotch pecan pie.  (They don't skimp on sizes as our pie slices were enormous!)  Excellent event.  I apologize as I can't recall the waiter's name; however, kudo's for a great job and making our event a success.",

    "text": "This place is simply amazing. My boss picked Twisted Grove for our holiday lunch and reserved the Board Room since there was roughly 20 of us. She also picked out a menu so there wasn't much picking for us to do other than our entree.   All of us pretty much showed up at the same time so the hostesses didn't have to do much to direct us to the Board Room. We had a few waiters assigned to us who did a great job. Always came around with drink refills for us. Set out the appetizers within a few minutes of everyone settling in.   My boss loves their Brussels sprouts so of course that was something we ate for appetizers. The presentation is a little weird (wood board and mason jar- so hipster), but the flavor is on point. Basically the BEST Brussels sprouts I've ever eaten! We also snacked on a few Burrata boards. Although I'm not a fan of tomatoes, these were seasoned enough that I even enjoyed them (but not as good as the mozzarella). The tomato spread for the flatbreads was a little too sweet for me and tasted similarly to ketchup.   Our entree options were short ribs with gnocchi, chicken, and pork chops. All, we determined, were very filling and rich for a lunch, but delicious! I selected short ribs and enjoyed every bite. I couldn't eat everything because of how great it was.   Following one of the greatest meals of my life was their cookies and milk for dessert. I forced myself to make room in my stomach for this epic cookie and semi-malted chocolate milk. If you think salt is disgusting with a cookie, think again.",

Sometimes, I wonder why tacos are so special and you know it's a good one when that morsel of a bite is a perfect balance of sweet, salty, and tangy. The other appetizer was the fried chicken. For main courses, we ordered the soba salad with beef. You have to add the beef for an additional cost but it was mucho worth it. The beef was flavorful and cooked to perfection. Lastly, we got the plate of veggie sides. For $16, you can choose from a list of veggies. I got broccollini, cauliflower, fries, and the spaghetti squash. All were good except for the squash because it tasted like I was eating a butter. Some may enjoy the excess butter but that's not my wheelhouse.   Other details: our waitress was really nice. They have a private room for events and the food spending minimum is reasonable too. I'm happy that I went and I will be returning!",

When I saw that it was the same owners as grassroots (somewhere we were considering but had a 30 min wait), I insisted we try it.  We arrived around 8:45 on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  There were plenty of others there, but not having to wait was nice. Overall, the service was a bit slow for my tastes, but it wasn't bad.   The food was all pretty good. We ordered a ton for 3 people and had a bunch of leftovers. Sad, because I wanted dessert!  My favorite was the grouper sandwich- best fish sandwich I remember having!  I also really enjoyed the grits. I ended up taking most of my noodle salad home, but I'm looking forward to having it for lunch today!  Overall, good experience. I hope this one makes it so there are more close-by restaurants that we like. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I have been here several times and my experience has always been phenomenal... until today.   My husband and I joined my best friend and her boyfriend for her birthday dinner this evening. We has reservations for 4 people for 7pm and we requested a booth. We arrived in and had to stand in line at the hostess stand, it was what appeared to be a busy night but that was no alarm to me since I've always had stand up service every time I've been here. When we reached the hostess we provided our reservation name and kindly reminded them that we requested a booth. We were quickly directed to the booth immediately behind the noisy hostess stand where we could hear every guest checking in (remember the long line I mentioned?) as well as the ringing phone and coworkers conversing among one another. Not really how you would want to spend your birthday, right? We promptly requested a booth farther away, plenty were open, but the young lady seating us seemed annoyed.  We were greeted by our server, Heidi, shortly after sitting. She asked us if we were ready to order drinks. My husband ordered a bud light however, the rest of us were too busy catching up to browse the drink menu. Heidi recommended getting waters for us while we were looking; fair enough but, that was the only time our water glasses were filled during the 2 hours we were at dinner. She returned with waters at which point we ordered our drinks and my friend ordered and appetizer for her and her boyfriend to share. Being that we had 4 guests, we were never asked how we were splitting the tab up front. We went on to order our meals and continued on with our dinner. Towards the end of our meal, my friends boyfriend asked if there was anything special they could do for birthdays; most places you can get a bowl of ice cream or a slice of cake for the birthday boy or girl to enjoy. Heidi went through a few options and I reminded my best friend of how much she loved the tres leches cake. Heidi responded with \"we can do that with a candle\". The way this was presented to us was that this was a special birthday treat that the establishment did for customers celebrating birthdays.  My friends birthday cake was delivered with a single candle and no plates or silverware (which had all be collected from us) to eat with. A few moments after my friend blew out her candle, a hostess dropped off a single check.... for the 4 of us. We placed two cards with our check, and told Heidi several times that we wanted to pay for our meal per couple. It took a few times telling her that we did not want to \"split the check down the middle\" for her to get it but she finally did and sped off. Heidi quickly returned to ask who's card was who's and then dropped off our checks. My husband and I received and itemized receipt with our check however my friends boyfriend who was of course picking up with birthday girls tab received nothing but a merchant receipt to add a tip to and sign. The food here was delicious but pricey so like any normal person, he wanted to be sure he was being charged appropriately so, he went to ask the hostess since Heidi was no where to be found. I watched the hostess follow my friend back to our booth and roll her eyes at him when he turned his back for asking for an itemized receipt. Seriously???  When my friends itemized check arrived we quickly learned that the tres leche birthday \"treat\" we asked for was charged to us and our cards were swapped after clarifying who to charge for what to Heidi. So frustrating. We were so shocked and upset about the lack of service we received not only from Heidi but from the whole staff this evening we just left; disappointed.   My friends and I come to Twisted Grove regularly and highly recommend it to everyone but unfortunately after tonight.. we will think twice about celebrating life events in this establishment.",

    "text": "Yes to everything!  I had a good feeling our inaugural visit to Twisted Grove would be stellar, seeing as how Grassroots is one of our favorite haunts. We were not disappointed!   We stopped in pretty early on Friday (5:45ish) and snagged one of the very last open tables available without a reservation. We weren't sat on the patio, but right next to one of the open doors so I got to pretend we were out there. Happy hour is available until 6:00 p.m., so we last-minute-snagged specialty priced bruschetta and I took advantage of their awesome HH wine special: ANY wine by the glass for $7! I had a glass of Predator \"Old Vine\" Zinfandel, which was a perfect accompaniment to my food.  Our bruschettas were the avocado/pickled onion/cilantro/jalapeno (2, since it sounded so good to both of us), and one of the goat cheese/dates/candied walnuts/honey. Both were outstanding. The bread was perfect and the toppings were fresh and worked so well together. The avocado's bread was SLATHERED in butter...or maybe it was very soft cheese? Or something. It was something that tasted delicious and unhealthy and I definitely did not care what the calorie count was.  For mains, I went with the mushroom & boursin cheese flatbread while my fiance had the tri tip sandwich with parmesan-garlic frittes. Word on the frittes: GET THEM. PARMESAN. GARLIC. YES. I devoured my flatbread. There was a moment with a few pieces left where I knew I could quit eating and be fine, but the garlicky spread of cheese and sauteed mushrooms topped arugula made me know feeling stuffed would be worth it. Tri tip was amazing/tender and like I said...those fries.  I lied, I did feel a twinge of remorse for cashing my whole flatbread, when I realized I was so full I wouldn't be able to sample the MONKEYBREAD for dessert. Pictures of that dish put Twisted Grove on our radar in the first place. But don't you worry, because now it is permanently on our \"regular\" rotation. Instant classic!",

The bar table tops were empty when we arrived and no one mentioned that they were reserved for groups coming in later. Should Chris have handled the situation like a professional restauranteur then people wouldn't have been so angry and pissed to leave without trying to get a table for dinner.

The salad was $15 which included chicken, and they charged $11 extra for the salmon, which we expected some up charge over chicken, but also expected a credit for no chicken. When we questioned this, our server went to the manager and came back only to tell us that this is how they do it. The manager never even came over in person. Very unprofessional. The staff here is not very friendly or inviting. The smiles are forced and most don't even look you in the eye when speaking to you. The girl that brought our appetizer didn't say a word, just dropped the food off, and didn't even acknowledge my \"thank you.\" Also the wine list is a joke, only 11 bottles each of white or red and overpriced. Our first choice they didn't even have.  We will never be back. A $26 dollar salad is ridiculous. Actually they have a different salad with salmon for $19.  The fact that the manager didn't personally come and talk to us tells me that they just don't care about their customers. If you like grossly overpriced food and wine and inept staff, then go for it!",

Other than that is has the ambiance of a brew pub, the TV screens everywhere, and, unfortunately, the noise.  The food is good enough for that fifth star.  We tried the grouper sandwich (best fried fish sandwich I can remember) and an eggplant and burrata sandwich (almost as good).  The flatbreads are also special.  The fries were good but not great, but the other side dish - cauliflower grits - was special.  I'll be back - the menu is much better than most brew pubs and there are lots of things I want to try.  HINTS: 1.  It can be pretty crowded so get reservations if they will take them (not sure). 2.  Skip the monkey bread. 3.  If you don't like noise, see if you can get a more out-of-the-way table.",

The ice cream soaked french toast was unbelievable. 3 of the 4 of us ordered it, and I got the grouper sandwich. Bloody mary bar was decadent, everything tasted wonderful and it was such a creative menu! Cant wait to go back and try more. I could literally order everything",

    "text": "Nice American looking restaurant with an airy patio. The menu is mostly American Comfort food.   I had the crispy grouper sandwich with spaghetti squash as my side. The grouper seemed as fresh as can be and was so moist and mild it just melted in my mouth. I did find it impossible to eat as a sandwich because the bun is too large so I ate it open faced with half the bun. The house made slaw and pickles were very tasty and cut the richness of the buttery rich bun and fried fish. For me I thought the spaghetti squash was too rich with butter, cream and cheese but my husband thought it was very good. The sandwich did cost $14.00 but I thought that was a very fair price for grouper since grouper runs about $22.00 a pound.  My husband had the cavatelli carbonara with the $1.00 add on sunny egg. He thought it was excellent but thought it was a small portion and should have came with a little bread or a small salad or should have been just a little bigger.  Our waiter highly recommended the monkey bread for dessert and said it was his favorite. The pies at the sister restaurant Grass Roots are outstanding so I thought dessert from here would have to be too. Honestly the dessert was tasty and reminded me of sticky buns but it was a lot of bread and can feed 4-6 people.  Service was friendly and efficient.  3.75 stars",

The salmon was delicious. I have eaten the sliders, which are good but priced a little high for happy hour in my opinion. Ambiance was conversational level on a Sunday evening and a Friday lunch.  They have a deal with a sweet shop next door for chocolate cookies which are out of this world.  I was annoyed by 2 flies during my meal, and the menu does not include various steak (prime rib after 5) otherwise I plan to visit again for a bite when I am in the area.",

The waiter was not attentive enough and it wasn't even busy.  We quickly realized we should order items when they came to our table because we didn't know when we would see them again. The empty plates were not picked up, even after setting them to the side for them to be easily accessed.  We ordered several appetizers.  Several of us ordered the sliders.  I didn't really check to see how many came with the order so when I received one slider I was a little surprised but didn't think too much of it.  Talking about it today we realized we had no idea how they processed our order.  The men received two sliders each.  I received one slider and another co-worker received two.   Today we went online to check the menu we should have each received four each.  We didn't order as a group, we ordered individually.  When they were clearing our table a gal took two of the leftover drinks and THREW the remaining liquid into the bushes next to our table and then stacked the glasses about 6 glasses high. Unfortunately, she cut her finger on one of the broken glasses that someone had dropped.  I thought to myself, well she may end up with another broken glass the way they were stacked so high.  They are going to need to get things right or they won't be a success.  The sliders were great. Someone in our party tries the oysters and she really liked them.",

My brother and I shared the crab and avocado cocktail. It was light and refreshing appetizer. I wasn't a huge fan of it being served with saltine crackers, mainly because the only time one eats saltine crackers is when you are sick with soup. A nice sea salt and cracked pepper artisan crisp would be a more appealing pairing in my opinion. For dinner I had the crab cakes and my brother had the salmon. I tried some of his dish and it was good, but simple in taste. The crab cakes with the citrus aioli were good. The highlight of my entire meal was the cauliflower grits as my side. I definitely recommend those! I think for the food itself that we had, the pricing was very high a dish. The crab cake entree which I had with a coleslaw side and the cauliflower grits was $29 and to be honest I didn't feel that the meal justified the price of getting it again.",
