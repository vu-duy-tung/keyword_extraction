I ordered the Cobb Salad and it wasnt the best Ive ever had and probably will not order it again.  It was an entertaining lunch with the apes making noises, the fish in the tank over looking our table, the elephants and other active animals. Love. Four stars because the mall of america in MN location rotates so guests can see all of the animals. I know, I know... tough crowd.",

    "text": "I'm usually not this harsh and can typically find something to like about a place but our experience was just not good. First, there was a huge line. I guess this is typical and I almost wonder if it's some ploy to make the place look more busy than it is.   Anyways, we get seated finally and we're in the corner. A round table and with no view of pretty much anything. Kids could hear the elephants but didn't get to see squat. To make it worse, the stupid table wasn't positioned well so basically, we had to wedge it against the other end of the simi-circle to even get in.   App were okay but the spinach artichoke dip was so overcooked it was nearly hard.  Got the main food and disappointing doesn't even cover my dish. Blacken tilapia w/ mango salsa. The salsa was so bland and did nothing for the poor tasting fish. Shrimp and scallops in cheese sauce. So if you're like me, maybe you're expecting a white cheese. Nope. American. Like Velveeta. Over the tiniest shrimp and scallops I've ever seen. Only saving grace was the coconut shrimp. They actually tasted good. Oh and the mashed potatoes but if you can mess those up, you deserved to be flogged.  Now at this point I think, whatever. Maybe I just got the wrong meal. Granted it was a $24 mistake but I'm not making that mistake with the desert. I get the volcano. Brownie, whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and fudge/caramel sauce. No, just no. The signature dish that's freaking everywhere is just bad. I can honestly say, it would have been better if the bought box mix and made it up.   So all of this doesn't really warrant the one star but this is one of those meals that keeps on giving, if you catch my drift. The hour spent in the bathroom was the final straw.   My suggestion, go when it's not busy if the kids just have to go. Order the cheapest thing on the menu and split it. Then go to the food court and get something else. You'll be safer that way.",

    "text": "I have been to the Rainforest Cafe when they first opened and went back two days ago since my daughter was visiting from out of town. We knew it wouldn't be reasonably priced but what a sticker shock! $66.00 for three people and no appetizers! The place has seen better days. Yes, it was noisy with the \"rain\" and the \"animals\". The fish tanks looked nice though. I eat meatless and had the veggie burger with onion rings, my other half had a cheeseburger and fries, my daughter had \"rasta pasta\". The Rasta she said had a funny oil film on it, and my daughter thought it was part of the sauce so she mixed it in. She said it tasted funny and kind of rancid. My burger was ok but was a bit mushy. The cheeseburger was average. It was all over priced but the bonus from it all is that we all got sick from our meal there! :(   I had a \"sour stomach\" (read between the lines) until this afternoon and hubby also. I was the worst of us. My daughter had an upset stomach but didn't get what  we were reeling with.. geez! As for waiting for water and drink refills we had the same problem as others had at this location. I was very disappointed and of course we will NEVER be back again. What a shame. If you go, beware!  It was suggested to me when I first did this review to contact customer relations , which I did,and have yet to hear back from anyone there.  Sad.",

There were about 5 little soggy shrimp on French fries and an ounce of coleslaw(more like a little bowl of cabbage almost no sauce). My son got two sad hotdogs two pieces of dried orange slices and mushy watermelon. My mom got a taco salad and the beef wasn't seasoned at all. A total of $54.65 plus the $8 tip we left. Then we went to use the restroom and it was DISGUSTING! I needed to change my youngest on the changing table and it was filthy! I wiped it off with a wipe and it came up almost black with dirt! I had to lay paper towels down because they were out of  protectors. The toilet was nasty! And the floors were just awful!! It looked like a nasty unattended gas station bathroom!! For the money your paying the bathroom should be clean.. I'm assuming the manager and another employee were standing around talking and didn't even acknowledge us. It was a horrible experience.",

The gentleman never spoke and roamed the restaurant approaching at least 8 or 9 tables. He had a drink at a table along with an awful lot of supplies.   I had noticed him before he approached the table because he was an adult male eating alone in what is a restaurant for basically children.  2.) Why does it take over an hour to get 2 burgers and 2  children's meals when there are only 11 tables occupied?  3.) They took 2 of the silver ware off the table. When the 2 children's meals came, they didn't bring any napkins for the kids. I asked for some and was told they would bring them.  We never received them.   4.) Costly food. Mediocre service.

    "text": "UPDATE//Looked at there health inspections and while they are given an A/B rating they consistently have problems with the cooler not being at optimum temperature. It needs to be at 41 or less and most of the time its 45 and up resulting in food not being properly cooled down. That's gross! Health inspector made the manager throw out food that was taking too long to cool. In one report the manager got the cooler to 41 at the end of the inspection. Meaning they purposely keep it higher to save money. At the risk of bad food! Also most of the food is precooked and simply reheated before you eat it. Almost nothing is fresh. Burgers are pre-made meat mixtures that are cooked on a flat top, not an open flame. Pasta is cooked twice a week and portioned into bags. Multiple issues with the proper sanitation not being used. Things are not properly cleaned and sanitized. I'm not sure if they checked this ever again but the dish washer didn't reach 160 until the 3rd run on one report. This place is just barely scraping by. They either need to close or be forced to change.   I hadn't been here since I was younger. Went with my mom and boyfriend. We waited in the line for 10 min. Wasn't super long and the place was full. We were seated and a few mins later our server came by and asked what we wanted to drink. Very soon after we had our drinks and he took our order. Everything was going great. Then it hit rock bottom.  Server only came by to refill our drinks, once, in a half and hour. Utterly ridiculous. He told us our food would be out soon. Another 10 mins went by. No food. So in total 45 mins and there was no food, people that came in AFTER us got their food and left. Place was almost empty there's no reason for that. We left money on the table for our drinks. There was a bunch of staff members at the front just talking and slacking off. W told one of the girls and she was more concerned with the money we left than the fact we had to leave because we got no food. Honestly that was the last straw.  No point in calling anybody about it because they clearly don't care. I don't want a free meal that I have to wait an hour for. Please please stay away from here.",

    "text": "I hate even giving this place one star, and only reason to justify it is because MY food was not horribly  bad. I got the pita quesadilla, specifically because it was one of the only items under $12. I do not understand how this restaurant can charge so much for basic meals. $11 for a plain burger, plus $1.30 if you want french fries instead potato chips. $4.50 to add a small side salad, $16 for chicken fried chicken that was more breading than meat (my husband literally had to scrape off about 1/2 of the breading).   The waitress was kind, but misunderstood my mom (even admitted she misunderstood) about free refills for a drink. My mom asked if it had free refills, she said yes. So my mom got refills, and the bill came out and charged her $6 or $7 per refill. She tried to dispute it, but the manager was completely rude: he was shaking his head \"no\" the whole time she was explaining herself, and he kept saying \"I'm not going to BUY YOU A DRINK\"- as if she was trying to get out of paying for drinks when she really did nothing wrong. He ended up walking away and putting his backs to us after saying he would not give us any discount (off food or drinks- yet it was the waitress' fault). My dad had to literally yell for him to give us his name because he wouldn't respond.  He was extremely rude and unprofessional. I am a manager of a QSR and was APPALLED at his actions. We spent almost $200 on sub par food and he couldn't remove refills due to a waiter's error.   Additionally, the bathroom was disgusting. No toilet sleeves, paper towels were empty, and there was fecal matter on the toilet I went to use. The floor is caving in inside the stalls, and paper was thrown everywhere.   Overall: bad food, bad atmosphere unless you're 4-8 years old (way too many crying 1-3 year olds when the lightening and thunder starts up), and rude manager.  Will NEVER come here again.",

    "text": "Today, my family and I attempted to eat at the restaurant. We had a party of 9 and there were many available seating areas but because we made no reservation (according to a very young hostess) we could not be seated. There was no line. We were waiting approximately 10-15 minutes before we even knew what was going on. Such a bad experience, especially when the young lady told my wife that if we did not like that we needed to make a reservation, we could go eat somewhere else. Really? We immediately got the General Manager involved and he had the exact same attitude. I will be in contact with the corporate office very soon to discuss the treatment we experienced. We are from Texas and wanted our kids to experience the Rainforest Cafe in Phoenix, AZ. Not a good showing for Landry's.",

    "text": "Just went here tonight on my brother's dime, as he wanted to take my kids here for dinner. The kids are finally old enough that the thunderstorm doesn't scare them and the storms are loud enough to drown out their loudness. Our server was great! She had no problem hearing our order or other requests throughout the meal. She even had the kitchen throw in a couple of extra chicken nuggets for the kids meal my youngin's shared (and I didn't even ask her to). Got our money's worth there.   I do agree the prices are steep, and yes it is a themed restaurant, so if you go here, you should mainly be going for the atmosphere. Cuz that's what they are serving up. The food is good, so really 3 stars for that, but if this place can keep my 3.5yr old and 5.8yr old entertained (which it did) without any meltdowns or fussiness throughout the meal, that makes me happy. The salad I ordered was large enough for me to bring half home for lunch tomorrow.  The fish aquariums kept my youngest mesmerized pretty much through the whole meal. If the host/hostess doesn't ask, request a table by a fish tank if you are going here with kids.   If you shop only the sale items at the gift shop, there is some cool stuff.  Definitely a different place to go once in a while, but not the sort of place you wanna go too often.",

After waiting an hour for food I stopped another waitress and told her if we didn't have our food in 2 minutes we were walking out and they could take the food and cram it. She went to kitch and 3 people brought out this horrible sub standard food. Over an hour to get the worst food I've had in a very long time. Burger tasted like it was beef mixed with possibly ground turkey and freezer burned flavor. Bun was hard as a rock, chopped lettuce on burger was turning brown, grand son ordered mashed potatoes loaded with garlic (not edible) sent back for corn (ice cold and floating in water-frozen corn)microwaved.I will never go back to this place and will definitely tell everyone I know to stay away from this ripoff of a place, they should shut it down and go out of business.",

    "text": "Okay, before I go into this review, when you go to Rainforest you are not going for the great food or for an economical and filling meal, because you will get none of that. The food is good, but not outstanding. It is not economical and you will likely leave looking for something else unless you order an overpriced appetizer. It's basically like high end amusement park fare. Sure it's entertaining that the animatronics and the simulated downpour every 10-15 minutes is fun but if I'm going to pay close to 50.00 for two people to eat, I expect they we should not be looking for something else afterward. Okay so that out of the way...  We have one of these close to home that we don't go to, but we are on vacation and just got a gift card from the timeshare people for sitting through their presentation so we really had nothing to lose here  The food is actually good, there just isn't very much of it. My wife and I each ordered the Mojo Bones which is St Louis style ribs we ordered the half rack because the price on the full rack was clearly out of the question. It came with Cole Slaw and Fries. The Cole Slaw was tiny and the fries were good but not many of them. So on novelty I give it a five on value I give it a one on food I give it a three so then the average is three. On a side note we probably would not have tried it if we didn't get a gift card for sitting through a time share presentation. Novel yes, but personally for ribs I'll go to Chicago for Ribs.",

They also substituted saled and/or fries with very tasty broccoli.  I wasn't overjoyed at this restaurant, but it was fine.

    "text": "Ok i would totally give it 5 stars but its not worth 5 stars and i will say why. 1. its way over priced, but the sizes were pretty good for adult servings. 2. i was really on the fence about trying it because of some of the reviews on here and other websites. our server was a tad slow but again we came on a Saturday at lunch time so its a given that it will be busy. the food was good, what i don't understand is why does it take 3-4 people to bring your food out i mean come on whats the point of a waitress if she cant handle a table of 6. the lighting was a wee bit on the dark side. over all its only a one time deal only once a year. what ticks me off is that they have a kids menu but then they turn around and charge you extra for fries, when it states it comes with a choice of your side. same goes for adult meals. i was like WTF really charge 1.50 for a few measles fries, really ticked me off. then at the bottom of the kids menu it says that they can get a water bottle but they don't tell you it cost 8 dollars! good thing i asked about them. i think they really screw people on the price and hide the fact they charge extra for fries or any of that on their menu, because when ordering they then tell you oh that's extra, grrrr, very poor business practice on their part, such a same because it could really be a good place if it wasn't for all the hidden fees and charges on stuff. 3 noise level was moderate to loud, it got loud when the animals were going off and thunder and all that, other then that a dark cramped seating area all the way around, we got seated next to a huge family in more ways then one, and they wouldn't even move an inch so we had to move and pull our tables so our lil kids could sit in the chairs. 4. my daughters \"dino\" shaped nuggets are the same ones i can buy a big bag for the same price i got stiffed with. there were some deals in the gift shop and then even there they try to get you to sign up for their rewards thing, yeah right like I'm going to be back anytime soon. I don't know i didn't have high expcations for the place so im trying not to get overly depressed on the 90 bucks i had to pay for 3 kids and 3 adults..........sigh the things we do for our kids!",

Children's popcorn shrimp and other food was ok which made  experience better and server did come back several times to see if we needed anything.  Prices are a little high.

The menu has decent variety but an average lunch was about 16 bucks. If i was spending that much at a gimmick eatery, then why not try the steak and shrimp? For 24 bucks, it had to be good right? Wrong. First, they forgot to bring the coconuts shrimp so a manager had to intervene. That'd because our waitress was nowhere to be found. The food was luke warm and of poor quality. The scampi and steak were completely flavorless and not cooked properly. There was no sauce that had flavor either. The shrimp was small and rubbery. The steak had so many fat strands that I could not cut it. When you see over half of the steak on the plate, you might want to ask the customer if something was wrong. Not once did anyone ask how the food was. Even when i filled out a comment card, they still didn't ask. I spent 70 dollars for 3 plates of food. Save your money and go get good food and service elsewhere. Not worth it! We will not be back. Want a gimmick place to eat for 70 bucks? Steer clear of this one.",

Maybe it gives me just a little bit of that \"over the top\" VegasISH themed whatever (since I'm not popping for a trip to sin city at the present time), but it's certainly a kid friendly atmosphere.  You can't argue that it doesn't have much competition in the Valley of the Sun (and heat and dust).    So, I've perused the menu and would certainly not go out of my way to eat a meal here based on prior reviews.  I am, however, reviewing it based on my experience with a mid-day cocktail last week which was KILLER.  My partner and I ordered a large (21 ounce) Margarilla which is a frozen Cuervo Gold (I believe) margarita with orange sherbert.  It ROCKED and I had a serious buzz on the way out.  At $10.99 each, it's not cheap, however, the bartender did give us a souvenier glass to take home.  And, I got to sit on a zebra barstool :)",

My daughter loved her macaroni and cheese orange slices and watermelon.  When our server came by to check on us he said \"how's the eggrolls?\" I responded oh they are egg rolls because i ordered potstickers. He then said he would put an order in for potstickers right away.  I watched him walk into the restroom area. My water glass had a crack.

    "text": "So I read a lot of reviews before we came here and I was a little unsure of our pick. We were a party of 5 at roughly 1:45 in the afternoon on a Tuesday.   Lets start with the good. Seated quickly by a very polite hostess. We were able to pick our table and got to sit in a section we desired. As the price is assumably for the atmosphere it was decent (would be great of there were fish and not empty tanks). The food was also pretty good, nothing special but not bad by any means. Although I cannot speak to any fish as we avoided it due to the overwhelimg complaints. The portion size was large too and we all left full. We had the lava cake and despite there no longer being a sparkler it was great. The slightly older gentalman who is the manager was very attentive and helpful. Along with serving our food and drinks he was the one who brought all our requests like ketchup etc. There was also a young attractive woman server with dark hair and black earrings running her butt off to serve plates to many, many tables.  Now the bad... My wife's drink arrived after the food. We had to ask for silverware. There is clearly a disconnect between the front and back of house. The chef's/cooks were serving tables during our entire visit. Our waitress was not very attentive and walked past several times without checking in. Many of the servers were simple not doing very much while the manager, hostess, chefs and the one waitress were running the whole time.  Overall it wasn't bad. I will admit the lack of fish is increditablly disappointing. One of the things that is a cornerstone of the brand and it's missing. Assuming you are willing to overlook that and want to have a good time with the kids in the rainforest it should be a good time. Be willing to pay for the experience tho. We had a good time but might not be at the top of our list on the next visit.",

    "text": "First and foremost, for all the people saying this place is \"Great for kids\" and \"Definitely a kid friendly environment\" I have to completely DISAGREE with those statements.   Everything looks as if it would be kid friendly, the moving animals, the talking tree, pretty fish tanks, shooting star sky, monkeys swinging from trees, etc. NO. NO NO NO NO NO. Do NOT bring your kids here. I don't know how many times i've been here, but every time someone brings their kids here, they let their kids walk around the whole restaurant because their kid can't sit still. I also don't know what the waiters/tresses are thinking putting people with kids next to the aquarium, banging on the glass like that. For the parents who let their kids slam their head against the glass, SHAME ON YOU. Shame shame!   Also, out of the many kids that do come to this place (let's say we have 10 kids in the restaurant as we speak) at least 2 of them sit there and stare in Awe, when the lightning/thunderstorm goes off, while the other 8 cry their heads off. Sure, loud noises tend to make kids cry, it's a natural reaction. How can we fix this problem? Don't bring kids to this restaurant! Plain and simple.   However, if you are a couple of love birds, or just want to go somewhere cute with your husband/wife boyfriend/girlfriend, this place is great to go when it's not so crowded. I personally LOVE the atmosphere, and everything about it.  What I don't love is the high prices. As someone else said, how they get away with these prices is beyond me...If my fiance' and I went with just ourselves (2 people) and got 1 meal each and a drink, it would most likely come out to about 40 bucks. Basically, 20 dollars a plate if you want to round it up.   One time we went, and we ordered an appetizer and it (no joke) took us about an hour to get the appetizer. Our food got cooked before the appetizers were done. This kind of ticked us off, however, the lady was really, really nice and talked to the manager, and he told her to waive the price of the appetizer off the bill. She explained to us and kept apologizing, saying that they had so many people and not enough cooks that day so they were taking it off the bill since we didn't get to eat the appetizer before the meal. We gave her an extra tip for being such a nice lady and doing that.   Even after me complaining about little bratty children and their \"i just don't care\" parents, I have to say this place is such a wonderful place to go to if you just want to order a drink and enjoy a fake Thunderstorm. I'm sure the waiters and waitresses probably get mad at us, but everytime my fiance, my friend and I visit The Arizona Mills Mall, we have to stop in at the rainforest cafe to order an ice tea, just so we can sit and chat and listen to the thunderstorm. Luckily for us, we usually get seated right under the sky. My favorite part of the whole Restaurant.  OH, and one more thing. If they ever try seating you in one of the booths in the back that are big and rounded, don't do it if you're a bigger built person. You will have a hard time squeezing in, an uncomfortable meal, and a hard time getting out. I'm not a big girl, and it was even somewhat snug for me to sit back in those booths. I could only imagine how someone bigger than me would feel. Definitely need to make the booths have more room.   4/5 stars, If there weren't so many kids at this place, I'd have given it a 10 if I could. Crying kids with parents who don't care about their crying kids tend to always ruin restaurant atmosphere, peace, and tranquility for me.",

Our server was friendly but I did have to flag him down for a refill of my drink. (That's always a sign of attentiveness--whether or not you have to ask for refills.)  I had the Pot Roast ($18) which was rich and savory. The beef melted in my mouth. The stew veggies were tender/crisp. The garlic masked potatoes were comforting. I ate the whole thing. My wife got the Mojo Bones half rack ribs ($17) which fell off the bones and was very flavorful with crisp edges. Both meals were piping hot with not long of a wait.   Yeah. They were a bit pricey.

While I know they aren't know for their food, how in the world does any restaurant that serves food that bad stay in business as long as they have? Our first clue should have been the fact that their chicken nuggets are dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets. I guess I didn't realize there were dinosaurs in the rainforest. No wonder I haven't seen a live one!  I order fish tacos and they were absolutely terrible. I send them back and the waitress says they aren't a very popular menu item and that she doesn't like them either. I then order a burger. How can you mess that up? Pretty easily, apparently. It comes out lukewarm and grey. I take a bite and it tastes like it is straight out of the microwave....ten minutes ago. I comment to the waitress and she sends over the manager. He comes over and tells me that 3 or 4 people have commented on them today and that they recently changed to a different type of beef and they now cook them on a flat top, no longer over open flames.  Enough said....thanks for the memories!",

We went there for a little trip to get out of the house for the day ( and If we are out of the house it also means I can't start the painting project I am supposed to do and it will have to wait until next weekend).  Anyway, We get there and the hostess tried to put us right next to the door so we asked for another table. They put us next to an aquarium which was good for me because the kids left me alone, but bad for the fish because the didn't leave them alone.  I got a hamburger with guacamole. the wife had an appetizer. the boy had two mini hot dogs and the girl had a pizza. the kids meals were the right size for them and my hamburger was pretty good.",

The clam chowder, which was clearly microwaved, salty, and cold was just disgusting! We were all burping it hours after we left and all got a very upset stomach. The main courses were \"ok\" and the sides that came with it were also COLD and disgusting! We also asked for some orange slices for our 11 month old (usually given to us for free, she's a baby!) we were charged $2 for 2 TINY slices.... Should have just brought my usual lil Baggie of oranges to keep her quiet and happy. I mean $2 I could have gotten 2 big FULL oranges for that price! I couldn't believe the prices for the crappy food that was served. I will never come back again and my boyfriend is STILL having stomach problems 24 hours later. Only come here if you would like a good case of food poisoning that'll break your pocket. Save your money for a NICE restaurant with GOOD food. YUCK!",

I've been to a handful of locations around the country and the experience has always been generally pleasant. Yes, it's expensive for mediocre food, and the service is generally slow, but I always thought the fun atmosphere made up for that. I especially found the multiple fish tanks compelling. I often insisted on being seated next to one. However, I believe the love affair has ended. I went to the Tempe location last night for my daughter's birthday dinner. I was very surprised and disappointed to find no fish. None at all. Gone. Where there used to be tanks in the dining area are now covered with fake flowers. The huge circular tanks at the entrance and gift shop...now just filled with bubbles. I've seen the animatronic animals dozens of times. It's always the same. The one detail that made every visit different was the fish. Now I really have no compelling reason to ever go back. I asked our server where the fish were. She simply said they were \"transferred\" to the MGM Grand, whatever that means. That's not much of an explanation. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.",

If you had kids, this would probably be great -- there's plenty to distract them -- animatronic animals and booming thunderstorms and drinks served in blinky rocket glasses.  You could probably even finish your overpriced meal and knock back a drink or two before the critters started actiing up.  You could even purchase a toy at the gift shop on the way in and hope to finish a dessert.  This will only cost you an arm and a leg, standard amusement park pricing.  If you're just 2 ladeez trying to catch up, this is probably not your venue.  There are kids and families all around -- happily, their ruckus won't be too annoying because all you can hear are jungle sounds and thunderstorms.  For a \"save the animals\" themed place, there sure was a lot of meat on the menu.  The only veggie options were cheez sticks or a veggie burger.  I guess I could've gotten the shrimp pasta sans shrimp, but I balked at the $17 price tag.  I did like sitting next to the enormous fish tank and having them peer at the progress of my dinner.  I was just glad I wasn't eating one of their pals.  I don't think I could've handled the bug-eyed gaping.",

I thought something was up too when we were there on a Saturday afternoon over Memorial weekend and the place was pretty much dead.  The artichoke/spinach dip was pathetic, and actually tasted like they put a lot of pepper (ew!) into it, and the chips were stale. I asked for a medium rare steak, and it came out damn near mooing and running around the plate as well as smelled funny (my son ate most of his as we split the plate before I got to mine so I couldn't send it back). I will say that the ribs were good though. Food quality was NOT worth the price I paid for the food. I paid $2.99 for a LEMONADE! UGH! Lunch for 2 - about $50 out the door tip included.  We got seated next to the large fountain, which at first I though was cool, and then I realized that my son and I could not have a conversation, and I was getting damp from the mist. It is sooooo louuuuddddd in there! If you are looking for somewhere to have a conversation this is NOT it!  Of course I got the usual crappy service after I told the server that we were going to split a plate (restaurant portions are too big,  so we always do this.)  Will not return.",

It was nice to be greeted by a warm and friendly hostess whom seated us at a comfortable booth. Our waitress was lovely and attentive. She brought our refreshing drinks to our table quickly and took our order. She knew a lot about the dishes on the menu. Our food was hot, fresh and delicious. I ordered the seafood platter. Everything was tasty served up with shrimp scampi, butterfly shrimp, tilapia, hush puppies, coleslaw, fries, spicy cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. My son ordered the cheeseburger quesadilla with fries; my other son ordered a cheeseburger with fries and my daughter ordered a lettuce cheeseburger wrap with veggies as she has to eat gluten free. We enjoyed the entertainment with the animatronic animals, the lightening and rain. It was a wonderful dinner and a treat. I highly recommend dining here if you come to the mall.",

Now, it seems like the place is a ghost town and I can understand why.  On my last visit, I saw a dead cockroach on the floor near the kitchen.  The bathrooms are musty, dirty and the floors are sinking in places.  The food is awful (it used to be delicious) and ridiculously over-priced.  The hostess is always rude and she seems to get off on telling you that they do not allow strollers (my bad; I thought this was a place for kids, but I'm not leaving my $600 stroller unattended at one of the biggest child trafficking hubs in the country).  What happened to the fish, by the way?  They've made so many cutbacks that they've killed the experience.    Would it kill them to seat you near one of the exhibits when the restaurant is empty, anyway?  Why do they always want to seat you near the bathrooms, the kitchen or the mall when you could sit next to the water?  It makes me sad.  They need to clean things up quick or I don't see how they will be able to stay in business much longer.",

    "text": "MOLD IN THE KIDS CUPS! I have never felt the need to write a bad review about any place besides today. When we went to the rainforest cafe, it was for my daughters second birthday. I tried to make a reservation, but was told they were booked but only had to wait ten minuets for a table. After the short wait, I had what they call a \"passport \" in my hand and walked up to what I believed to be a host stand. Someone grabbed the passport out of my hand (a hostess named Gabby), without even saying anything. Another host asked if I had been helped when gabby came by and said \"I got em\" and proceeded to take us to a table. I asked Gabby politely if we could have a table next to the animals because it was my daughters birthday. She ignored me and said \" I'm sitting you here.\" Another employee came by and so I asked them which they obliged, but Gabby said \"ugh I guess we can move you.\" I then asked her her name and she quickly became a different person, offering my baby a balloon. The table wasn't a great one, I could tell she was annoyed and didn't want to sit us somewhere else, and I wouldn't have ever asked, but it was my baby's second birthday. Anyway, we bought a cup with a frog lid to commemorate her second birthday, had so so service (which whatever its more for the atmosphere), and went on our way. I still had a bad taste in my mouth from the way that hostess treated us but still wouldn't write a review until we got the frog cup home and it's head was full of mold! I'm so pissed, I saw almost every table in the place get one of those cups, and it makes me sick to have a place especially for kids have cups that could them really sick! Awful!!!!!!!!",

Slippery tile floors with soap and water all over them and you can't even turn around without jumping into someone or something. Tiny and disgusting. I didn't like what I ordered last time (the veggie burger) and the coconut shrimp and fries today were like long John silvers at best. And to pay these prices is ridiculous.

For a one year old Mac and cheese, 2 adults meal and one hotdog for a 6 year old; came total of $116 not including tip. Outside they have a little store for you to shop. I would suggest not to go here if you are tight in budget. The food is not good for you to pay $30/plate. I'd rather go to a fancy restaurant and get really really good food for that price.",

Once seated, we had to wait a while before our waitress came. By the time she came, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we went ahead and gave it to her. The group sitting next to us got their food before us. About 10-15 minutes after that we asked the manager. After he checked on the order, he informed us that our waitress had not put in our order. He then offered us 50% off our meal, and put our order in. We got our food fairly quick after that. I was hoping to be offered something small prior to our food, but no such luck. Everyone was pleased with the food. My club was just an average club though. When we got our check, they charged us for an adult size soda with the kids meal. It was supposed to include a drink. It was also my son's birthday, so we informed them. They came over and sang and gave him a cupcake. They then charged us for the cupcake also. Oh well, at least we got it for 50% off!",

Neither entrees came with the veggies I asked for. The rest of dinner went fine. Bill came out and we were charged full price for soups instead of the add on with dinner price. the waiter tried to say it was because of tax but eventually checked menu and fixed it. We were charged $9.25 per draft beer and no one told us it was because we get to keep the cups it comes in that we never wanted. Had to look over a menu on the way out to double check draft beer prices to find out we get glass cups. Bartender was mad we didn't keep our dirty ones and was ignoring the waiter trying to get us our cups.. Ridiculous.

There is a faux thunderstorm that occurs every 20 minutes or so, that makes the animals go wild and cause a ruckus which kept my 3.5 year old daughter amazed. She was entertained the entire time and ate her whole meal - chicken tenders in dinosaur shapes and broccoli. There is a colorful jungle themed bar for the grownups.",

    "text": "This place could use a good dusting.  When it first opened everyone was amazed at how \"real\" the plants and animals look.  Now - they look dusty.  Very, very dusty.  Now I'm guessing it would take even more that a massive dusting to bring back the days of 2 hour long waits and lines to get in the doors (Yes, it was like that for a LONG time) but it sure would help.    I have a friend who loves the food, so I've only been there with a child once (sad I know).  Every other time it's been with all adults.  Yea, it's Disneyland cheesy, but it's also kinda Disneyland cool.  You have to appreciate the work behind some of this stuff.  And remember - it's a theme restaurant. It's supposed to keep it's theme front and center.  And yea, it can get a little loud.  Especially if the gorilla starts going off on one of his long rants as you're trying to order.  But I've never really had a problem with it in hearing the group or giving our order.    My favorite part honestly is the archway between the restaurant and the gift shop.  It is a giant fish tank.  No animatronic fish here.   Real fish.  And it's pretty freaking cool.  But the star it might gain from that it immediately loses for the prices.  Just like many theme restaurants, they are overcharging you for the food.  Of course they have to cover the costs of maintaining that fish tank and all those animatronic animals.  So while I kinda get it, it's still too much for a regular dinner.    Their gift store is almost another review in itself.  Again, a bit overpriced, but they honestly do have some really cute stuff.  I've gotten a few small things here as gifts over the years for kids who are in that \"I love animals\" phase of life.  Always a hit.    When your aunt and uncle with kids come into town and want to go somewhere different that the kids will like - You'll get big bonus points for bringing them here.  Other than that, it has a fairly limited audience.  And dear heavens, don't bring anyone who is an OCD cleaner.  They may never leave.",

Like someone said below, Apple bee's is a better bet for this type of bar food. This place would be rad if you were a little kid, but I will never eat here again..

    "text": "This restaurant is more for entertainment than for grub. I brought my four year old niece here after the Sea Life aquarium for more fun entertainment while attempting to get her to eat some lunch. It was pretty empty and thus the hostess let us choose wherever we wanted to sit. I asked for the best locale with the most animation and she sat us next to the elephants. Once my niece's high pitched scream of \"elephants, look at the elephants, Tasia, look at the elephants. No, look there. There's the elephants\" stopped we were able to sit down and take a peek at the menu.  The restaurant offers a wide variety from a Chinese chicken salad to coconut shrimp, to a few different cuts of beef. I opted for a side Caesar salad (minus the Caesar dressing) with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing that left the romaine lettuce looking for croutons to used as life preservers. The only plus to the side salad  was that it did come with a very scrumptious rosemary infused roll. I also split a burger with my mom that was okay. The cook did a good job getting my medium temperature request right, but the burger just lacked flavor. The burger usually comes with chips but we opted for  \"safari fries\" which again, were okay. I guess being sprinkled with Old Bay flavoring qualities for the \"safari\" title. My niece got the Mac n Cheese that she devoured pretty quickly which is rare. My suspicion leads to the fact that she just wanted to run around the restaurant and look at the other animatronic animals as opposed to it being outstanding Mac n Cheese. The atmosphere is pretty rad. They really do a good job with the rainforest theme. There are misters over certain parts of the restaurant (not directly over patrons), sparkling twinkling lights on the ceiling, a few fish tanks and many animatronic animals: elephants, apes, a cheetah, and an alligator when you first walk in. Every so often (maybe ever 30 mins?) there is a \"storm\". The lights dim and flash and the sound system plays thunder while all the animals make noises. It's definitely a great place to bring kids and definitely not a quiet restaurant.  Based on the food, I'd give it a 3 star rating maybe 2.5, but the atmosphere deserves a 5 for what it successfully accomplishes. I also like the fact that they have a donation pond when you leave (or enter, but I missed that going in) to through loose change into. That is where the animatronic alligator is located and it's fun to try and get the change in his mouth when he opens it.",

We signed up for the Safari Club card, it cost $10.00 for lifetime membership and we saved that on the gift shop and our meal, then we'll get a $10.00 gift certificate to use on our next visit.  The food was just average, nothing to write home about, but the decor was worth it!  The kids and I really enjoyed the animatronic animals, the inside rain, waterfall and lightning strikes and thunder.   Our services was average.  It was really nice that grandma's wheel chair fit nicely under the table and was comfortable. We really enjoyed the total experience.",

(Complained got no response from anyone) my girlfriends veggies were still frozen together.

Little bit of a bad experience when I asked for my check a bus boy dropped a hot plate which crashed against the back of my chair. And without an apology or recognizing he just went about his way while my back is covered in sauce and im sitting on broken plates and knives all over the floor.

    "text": "The Rainforest Cafe has below-average food, small portion sizes, and subpar service, and it is WAY overpriced. My husband and I went for dinner at about 5:15 on a Saturday night. The line of people waiting for seating was very long. I noticed lots of parents and kids waiting to see the hostess for a table in the dining room. In typical \"me first\" fashion, some patrons chose to bypass the line of families by cutting through the bar area and approaching the hostess station from the side. I'm not sure how the hostess didn't realize they had cut the line by going around. But their tactic worked, because the line-cutters did get seated in the dining room before everyone else that was waiting in line. My husband and I decided to go into the bar to ask if the seating in the bar was first-come, first-served (as is often the case). We stood at the bar, hoping to ask the bartender if we could sit there. We stood and waited...and waited...and waited some more. One bartender ignored us as another bartender kept going back and forth to two women because all their credit cards were being denied. Finally, I sat down at a bar table just to rest my feet. At that point, a waiter approached me with menus. I asked if we could sit there and he said yes. I called over my hubby, who was STILL waiting for a bartender to acknowledge him. After perusing the menu, we ordered the tortilla chips and queso sauce for an appetizer. It was over $8. We were served a tiny bowl of Velveeta type stuff on a large plate with a handful of stale tortilla chips. The waiter didn't even give us appetizer plates, so we had to keep pushing the bowl on the plate back and forth across the table so as not to spill the fake cheese. (He did not come back to check on us; otherwise I would've asked for appetizer plates). For dinner, my hubby got a shrimp platter with 3 different types of shrimp. He said the meal was just \"ok\". I got the veggie burger. It, too, was maybe \"ok\". It definitely wasn't worth its $12-$13 price. My husband had a soda and I had ice tea. When the bill came, my hubby looked at it and said,\"oh, wow\". He doesn't usually say anything like that unless he really feels he's overpaying for something. Later I learned that the bill was over $60 when the 15% tip was included! $60!!! We didn't even drink alcohol! That's just too much money to pay for lazy servers and bad food. Skip it!",

Huge fish tanks, vines, leaves, trees, bushes, rain, even animatronics animals. It's quite the place! We sat at the bar and their barstools are actually formed into different animals, which is a very cool idea. We decided on a few drinks and ended up ordering an appetizer to share. The cheese sticks we had were very good! Nice and crispy on the outside and the cheese was warm and gooey on the inside. The marinara had a lot of kick to it. It's a really basic dish, but I can't tell you how many places I have been to where the cheese sticks are hard, the cheese isn't melted or gooey and marinara taste like watered down tomato soup!  The staff was very friendly; the atmosphere was really cool, it was a nice place to grab a quick bite! I can't wait to come back and try a main dish and sit back in the restaurant where all the action (animatronics) are!",

Both adult orders were incorrect as well. Prices very high even if it was an even halfway decent experience. Our five year old enjoyed the handful of animatronic animals but still got bored.",

Our son is very allergic to peanuts and when we notified our server she had the chef come out and speak directly with us.  The chef pointed out what our son could have and took notes specific to his allergy.  As a parent with a child with an allergy it is very refreshing to have this kind of attention given to his safety.   It is also a 'fun' spot for kids to attend and entertaining for them.  As for the food quality I rate it slightly above fair, but that is not why you come here.",

Her reply \" I would've had to charge you more and I know you did want that... Know what I'm saying\". NO, I'm sorry I don't know what your saying. Then I asked for plastic cutlery ( as I always do). Our food arrived after 30 min. However we had nothing to eat our food with. I had to ask another waiter. When we finally saw sienna again I asked for ranch and Tabasco. 10 more min pass, she asked if I needed anything and I said yes the ranch and Tabasco I asked for and more water. Someone else brought the ranch and she brought Tabasco with three drops in it and said let her know if I need more......smh. The manager walked passed too many times to count and said nothing. When the waitress came by again, I asked for more Tabasco she laughed and said ok. She came back with another bottle within two or three min. And this bottle had no top and dried up all around the opening( in the picture I posted) I asked another waiter for more and he brought it right away, I was already so annoyed I didn't get his name. Anyhow I do love this place because as a parent of a 19 month old, I want her to see the cool atmosphere. This was our second time here and both times we had bad waitresses and I feel like it the management that's not on top of things so the staff does whatever they want",

She ordered a well done bacon burger that came medium rare so we sent it back... No big deal. The second burger came and the middle was completely raw. This was extremely frustrating because for a menu that has much more complicated like seafood, chicken and streak cooking a well done burger should not be too difficult. By this point, everyone else had finished eating so she opted not to have a third burger come out but wanted to let the manager know so that they can fix this issue in the future. The manager came over and was extremely rude, having a retort and argument for everything we brought up. We weren't complaining about it, but rather just raising the concern over someone possibly getting food poisoning (which she may have gotten if she hadn't have cut the burger in half). We then spoke with the general manager who happened to be in the restaurant this evening and he was much more receptive and apologetic about the situation. Other than the shift manager being extremely unprofessional and rude, the service was great and the food was not bad (a little pricey, but not bad). Will not be going back.",

Immediately got on her head device and started talking shit about us to whomever was on the other line.  Uhh WE TOTALLY HEARD WHAT YOU WERE SAYING! And we also saw the face you made.  You could have kindly said that we don't allow strollers in the restaurant and we would have kindly said that's fine.  Horrible and just rude customer service.

The bartender ignored me for a long time. She was making drinks, but even when looking my way did not acknowledge me. Once she did, she was helpful with accommodating my vegan food request.   I'm a Landry's member and the manager was called (by the bartender) to take my number. The manager walked right past where me and my son (both African American) were standing (at the end of the bar near the registers) to a group of white people sitting at the bar (near the end toward the exit of the bar area into the store). She said, \"I heard you were Landry members looking to add your number.\" They looked at her and said no. She continued on, like they were mistaken, \"You're not Landry members with a carryout order?\" The manager was sitting right next to me with her back toward me and I shook my head and rolled my eyes as the customer she was talking to again explained they weren't the group she was looking for. I said it was me, then the manager turned her False smile and cordial tone my way. I do not want to automatically assume it was a racist act but it was certainly biased and rude. I'm also quicker to \"blame\" the manager and bartender's overlooking me on the restaurant being semi-busy than their implicit bias toward African American patrons.   I won't visit that location any time soon, if ever, but if anyone asks for food suggestions I'll recommend the location, citing  my experience as a warning to be on the lookout, with the caveat that it may not be the norm.",

Just progressively got/getting worse and worse.   Not sure they have hostesses working there. Took 15 mins for someone to address us and I never saw that woman again the entire visit. We almost left after 5 servers passed by and didn't even glance our way. No sign saying wait to be seated or seat yourself. We weren't quite sure what to do but stand there and wait to be addressed or even be given eye contact.   Server was nice and laid back. But maybe too laid back. Took forever to get drinks, never got refills until we flagged him down to ask. Asked for appetizer plates. Didn't get them until we were almost done with our appetizer and actually was given kid trays bc they were out of plates.   Food was okay but not worth the amount paid at all.  Burger was over cooked and dry. Fries looked and tasted like they had been sitting in old grease before being served to me. As far as price goes, I get that you are paying for the experience as well. However when the food and service was subpar ... kinda drags down the entire experience.  I must say the highlight of our visit was the sweetest little old lady face painting at the entrance. She made my daughter so happy after she felt so disappointed in what used to be her favorite restaurant. I was shocked when she said she didn't want anything from the gift shop bc she always got something from the gift shop after lunch.   Oh and the bathrooms were beyond terrible. I don't even want to talk about it.",

He also apologized about not knowing how to run a gift card etc in the store. It doesn't give you extra points anymore like it used to. (We found out about that after the fact.) Our problem was with the server. She was a real dip!!! The place was pretty empty. Our problems started with the soup. We waited a while and the server to come back to our table to find out what happened to our bowl of soup. She said it was kind of strange that we didn't get it already. I understand this problem would be worse if the place was busy but there weren't many people there. She said it was put in the window by the chef and was run by someone to the table, but we didn't get it from that person. We got the soup and that was good. Our drinks took a little time to get refilled and the server was not as attentive like she should have been.  The last straw happened after we paid the bill and she took the souvenir cups off the table to dump out the ice and package them up.  She was talking too much and spilled the ice all over the table and some of it got on me and my wife. She apologized but really kept smiling about it and didn't compensate us in any way possible. Also, she didn't even clean it up in any way! She was like oops that never happened to me before. Really dumb! Especially for a $95 meal I think was a bit overkill. She got my new shirt and my jeans wet from the ice and it was a little sticky!   My wife and I were a little shocked.  Like the restaurant and the atmosphere.  You need to hire competent staff and lower prices a      little bit and then maybe you would be busier on a Sunday during the holidays.  Your phone conversations are useless after my review was put up on yelp. I did speak to a manager but nothing came out of it.  Telling me your restaurant was technically closed and we were still seated. The most informative thing I was told is that the souvenir glasses we should have taken home should have been new ones from a box. The server should have given us a receipt to take to the store. Ice would not have been dumped all over us and the table if your server knew that!",

Honestly the food itself isn't the best and is over priced, but the appetizers are pretty good, so we usually order a few to share. If your kid is sensitive to loud noises they may find it scary to eat here. Every 30min all the animals make noises, with thunder and lights flashing.",

When we asked to speak to the manager a woman came out and she acted like she didn't have a care in the world. Don't recommend this location at all.",

    "text": "This place has been here as long as I can remember, but I've only ever had one good experience and today was not that day. We went to the mall to do some shopping, and really just wanted some appetizers as a light snack since we were planning to do a family dinner at home. We got sat without a wait, as it was at the tail end of the lunch hour, and there was plenty of open seating. Being gluten-free, I was extremely limited in what I could even order. I settled on the spinach and artichoke dip for $11 in lieu of an $18 salad option. The rest of the family did the Adventure Appetizer Platter with a little bit of everything, and a hot dog meal for our 2-yr old daughter... I'm surprised we were able to even order off the menu because the lighting is terrible. The table next to us pulled out their cell phones and used the flashlight function to read their menus. We were lucky to sit halfway under the lone dim light bulb in our section... once the food was ordered, the kid's meal came relatively quick, but the adults sat for 40 minutes waiting for APPETIZERS. And it wasn't even busy! We were legit looking for our server to cancel the order and leave, but the next time we saw her she was carrying trays of food. EXTREMEMLY overpriced for the serving sizes (especially for an outlet mall), TERRIBLE service, and the food is honestly not that great. The schtick is the animatronic animals and decor, but that is hardly worth what they charge for your meal before you exit through the gift shop. Do yourself a favor and save the rainforest from ruining your day, and go to Garcia's across the way.",

What an embarrassing experience.  After placing our order, we waited an entire hour before getting up and leaving the restaurant (without any signs of our food).  The restaurant had three other tables going, that's it.  Our server checked on us ONCE after 45 minutes to say \"it will be 5-10 more minutes, I will put my best guys on it.\" Little did we know the last laugh was at our expense. Prior to leaving I asked to speak to a manager.  Waited another 10 minutes for a manager to show up, and they could not even figure that out.  There's really no wonder this restaurant, as a chain, has lost its relevance in the last ten years. We had 10 people with us--and with their prices that means at least $200 walked out the door with us. I was horrified to tell my guests, \"we should just go get a bag of burgers because this is ridiculous.\"  Sure, go for the atmosphere, but do not expect any kind of service.  FYI that was my first time \"walking out\" of a restaurant in my entire life. Embarrassing and pathetic.",

Several dinner items were ordered including shrimp, burgers, chicken & 2 kids meals. Had to ask for spoons for the kids apple sauce & extra napkins. Shrimp was \"meh\", burgers were ok, chicken overly dry. We went for the children's enjoyment of the surroundings, decor, animal sound & motion. The restrooms were filthy, the floors & stalls spotted with ??? & the wastebasket overflowed with trash on the floor!  Where is the manager? $17-19 burgers, etc definitely NOT WORTH IT!  For 7 adults& 2 kids our bill without tip was $255. Food quality, service & cleanliness were terribly lacking!  Will never recommend or return!",

    "text": "OK, my daughter has been asking to go here forever, so for her 11th birthday we took her. I have not been since 2006 at the Mall of America in MN, and previously in Florida. I knew it would be overpriced, but it was so much worse than that. First of all, there was not enough barrier between the seating and the mall, and as I watched the dusty animatronics I could see the shoppers strolling by. The vines were so dusty, and have off the animation was not working right. The rain used to seem so much more intense.   Next the food. First - bring your own water - every drink tasted like sanitizer!!!! We had the waitress rinse the glasses and bring more and it was better, but than the refills tasted like a band aid again. Next, some of the portions were decent - my father in law got the fish and chips - it looked good, had cole slaw and fried. I got the coconut shrimp - about $4 more - had mini scoop of cold icky mashed potatoes and 8 small shrimp stretched on a skewer. Literally, my daughter's kid's plate had more food on it and that was other people's comments not mine. The shrimp did not taste bad, it was just a sorry excuse for almost $20! It should have had a veggie and maybe a salad or bread to boot!  BTW, my wife who is 1/3rd my size had the same meal and also walked away hungry.  So, ambiance was lacking -- it looked like a tired old carnival ride. Food was way overpriced, food portions inconsistent.  Than, I said something to the manager. I waited until it was over because my wife hates it if  I complain, and it was my daughter's birthday. All she said was sorry. I could tell she has heard it before. There was certainly no customer service going on here.  For the next birthday I am going to blow the money on a birthday party instead of a nice meal, or else, go somewhere good for food and find entertainment elsewhere.",

Once I asked to be seated, no one took our order. I went to the cashier's area to inquire. When our order was finally taken it was delivered wrong. My friend, being polite, started to eat her shrimp on her salad, when she had ordered chicken. The server offered to \"pull\" the shrimp and bring chicken. How do you pull shrimp off of someone's plate? He saw my look of horror so he said his manager was being very nice and sending chicken. I had several strands of short black hair on my plate, as did my friend. It was so awkward, we hoped they were strands of hair from the monkey swinging above us, but I think we both knew better. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Oh yeah, my mule drink in the brass cup was good. All in all, overpriced, thus empty...lackadaisical servers.",

My body feels polluted after eating here. The kids' Dino nuggets were the best thing I nibbled on. Hubby's burger tasted like rubber (he said), my coconut shrimp was dipped in batter, rolled in sugar, fried and then rolled in sugar again, and the adult tropical beverage was a joke --- waaaaaay too syrupy sweet and hardly any alcohol.",

Our party of three ordered 2 appetizers, the spinach-artichoke dip and barbecue chicken flatbread. The appetizers were very good. I ordered my usual, Volcano Cobb Salad and it still does not disappoint. My youngest son had their kids grilled cheese. My bill with tip was a little over $90.

About every 8-10 minutes there is a loud \"thunder storm\" complete with loud cracks of thunder that drown out your conversation and flashing lights.  The menu has good potential but the food you get is nothing like what is described. Our waitress didn't write anything down, which isn't a problem if there are 2-3 people. We were a party of 5 (haha) and I was nervous that things would get forgotten. Things were forgotten. I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and a \"Cheetah-Rita.\" The margarita mix was WAY too sweet and I couldn't tastes the alcohol (I may also have a drinking problem.... Yet to be determined). The dressing was about the only thing enjoyable. The chicken was dry like it was from lunch yesterday and may have been overlooked then. My best friend had the Chicken Parmesan and subbed mashed potatoes for the pasta but they brought out pasta anyway... Also forgot the applesauce that was to come with her son's pizza. One of the other girls in our party ordered nachos and asked to have a few things left off as well as extra cheese. The nachos came out with little cheese and all of the things she asked to have omitted. My sister seemed to enjoy her lunch, or at least was not vocal about it.  Upon coming to check on us, the waitress asked if everything was ok and exclaimed \"Oh no the cooks didn't read the ticket!\" Cooks are not stupid and were certainly not too busy to ignore special requests. Waitresses who don't write anything down are prone to forgetting things.  Almost finished with our meal and my friend and her sister were not offered refills. Regardless of how far into a meal you are, the waitress or another staff member should offer a refill.",

A man came out and took charge after a 20 minute wait and sat the large party. Ours was a party of 7, which for lunch is a bit large, however, this is a destination restaurant and should be able to handle the larger screen parties. We were finally seated after a total wait of 21 minutes. The waitress immediately addresses the table and took drink orders. Our orders were taken and we waited 45 minutes for food. The food was cold, taco shells were impossible to chew,cheese was congealed or melted and cooled several times. The biggest disappointment was the aquariums retrofitted with bubblers instead of fish. The tanks used to be an educational experience for my grandkids. I was able to teach them about water chemisty, natural biological filtration and tank cycling.  I'd say that in the last several years this cafe will no longer be where we entertain our grandchildren.",

I only go here for my kids because the food you can get at Applebee's for half the price. It's not awful food, it's just food you can buy in the freezer section and heat up at home. Also the bathrooms are disgusting. I understand being busy and understaffed, but there is no reason to be serving food and have a bathroom looking like that.",

The aquariums are great as well. As for the food, I think it has improved in quality from previous times. The one drink I got was very weak, nearly no alcohol for 12 bucks, so I would complain about that. The food in general was tasty but 4 people ate for 125.00, bit expensive if you ask me. But again it's an experience. My advice for keeping it a bit cheaper would be to share a burger $10-$15. The kids meals are about $6, but the optional drink cup will cost you an additional $8. It adds up quick.",

The pressed penny machines are always a cool and cheap, $.51, souvenir, that should help you getting around spending money in the attached gift shop. They have a full bar, and the kids can get a kid friendly frozen drink in a special cup. Kids meals are about $6-$7, adults range from $15, for soup and salad combo, to $22-$30 for fish or seafood. I wouldn't go here for the food, but go for that look on yours kid's faces and the cool parent/grandparent title for taking them there!",

There appeared to be ample staffing and plenty of seating, yet we waited in a line to be seated for a good 15-20 minutes. That should've been our signal to leave the Rainforest. Once given a table and menus, we then waited another 20 minutes.....no wait staff came by....not for water, not to greet us....nothing. Our 2 year old had reached her statute of limitations and we bailed.   Advice to management....when you have a pricey menu, and a niche atmosphere that caters to impatience kids (and parents), you better be sharp with the service experience. Shame on the manager for not being more observant and holding his staff to a higher standard.",

However, the best thing about the appetizer platter is the southwestern eggrolls. Also, the artichoke and spinach dip is super good just the bowl they give the dip in is a tad smaller too.

As most Arizona's would appreciate asked for a salad in lieu of rice and beans which came to shock would cost me an additional fee if $4. No im not kidding. So now my super average meal transformed into unreasonable not to mention disgusting. My now weak tacos accompanied by gallons of mayo in tasteless ranch on my $4 salad just tipped the tables  We don't be back, pathetic and poorly managed. There's no experience or atsmophere other than the zoo that would i frequent and pay money for with such underwhelming result. Buh bye Rainforest.",

Once I justified the prices based on the fact it's in a mall, I hoped the food would be good. The food was terrible. Our food spent a fair amount of time under a heat lamp. I worked in the restaurant for years so I can identify heat lamped food. Our server was awkward when he came around which wasn't often. We asked for a few things when the food came, none of which we ever got. The animatronic animals are cool, but I recommend watching from out in the mall.",

Not anymore!  The hostess was rude and lazy. We were seated near the bathroom entrance even though there were plenty of tables available. It took 10 minutes for our server just to greet us them Another 10 minutes to get our drinks. We actually received our appetizer before our drinks. Food was just okay. It lacked flavor. I went with the chicken fried chicken and they forgot my potatoes. My server was MIA most of the time and I had to find another server to help me get a box and the bill. I was so sad to see this place go to the Pitts. It is a fun place to come visit if you are out of town to see the decor but that is it.   By the way Bathrooms were so dirty and disgusting.",

The food wasn't amazing, but it was good enough for a theme chain place. They actually have some pretty good drinks for adults too.  The service was a little slow, but I couldn't complain too much since the atmosphere was really keeping the kids happy and fascinated - giving us time to talk and actually eat.  Of course you end up spending money in the gift shop, but I think it really gives kids an experience that they enjoy and they have enough choices on the menu that you don't feel like you are sacrificing too much.  This location is inside the mall, so parking can be a bear if you aren't planning to visit the mall as well as the cafe.",

After getting out of that clearly unmarked line I stepped into the actual wait to be seated line.  The waiters and waitresses were dressed in safari gear which fit with the rain forest theme.  The restaurant is dimmed  so you can see the small star display on the ceiling and the trees are lit up with fish tanks randomly placed around the interior.  Personally I thought the menu was very over priced for the generic food that was served. I tried to play it safe with a cheese burger and chips and that ended up to be $15.00.  Burger was dry and the bun was greasy.  The chips were tasty though kettle cooked.    I had my hopes on going to this establishment but I just wasn't pleased. I think more exotic food items and semi lower prices or even a happy hour sort or menu would be a great idea.",

He never came, which was probably for the better because he would have gotten an ear ful.   Food was so so, had to ask for refills, asked for a to go box which we never got.

The manager (I'm assuming) didn't really seem to know what to do and frankly didn't seem to care as he didn't say much. Granted, he did offer a replacement meal and we weren't even sure if we were going to get a discount or something but the waitress (Anisabel) made it all better. She sincerely expressed how sorry she was and surprised us by taking the my whole meal off our check. I was about to be completely livid about the whole situation but Anisabel had given us such superior customer service that I couldn't help but leave content with how the situation was handled.

We sat for 20 minutes without anyone coming to our Table and after two inquiries if we had a server.  One person said I'm sure someone will be with you and the other one came when we were leaving.  Talked to Tom the GM and he didn't seem too surprised.  When we walked in one of the hosts said let them sit wherever we have servers standing around doing nothing.  Wow - last try - this place has gone down - very sad - needs an entire revamp - Landry's - what happened?!",

That is the only reason for one star. The service not so good, only checked on us 3 times, and looked annoyed. All cafes should be about the food on that note the food was horrible. The bacon BBQ burger was drowning in BBQ sauce, And cool to the touch. There was so much sauce the bread was soggy. 13.99 for a lunch meat filled turkey sandwich slopped with mayo. Kids hot dog again like warm at best and not kosher dare I say bar S? My other son had Mac n cheese again cold temperature. They charged .99 for a birthday cupcake I didn't ask for. Should a 5 year olds one person sized cupcake be free? This place is expensive and not worth half of what they charged, sorry to be harsh...but ugh! Not good.",

    "text": "I'm very particular about where I eat and I usually cook most of my meals at home if possible since the majority of family friendly restaurants are just OK.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the food we ate at Rainforest Cafe yesterday.  I ordered Mac and Cheese for my daughter and was expecting something that came out of a blue box, but no, it was actually homemade pasta and cheese.  It was just like something I would make her at home!  We also ordered foccacia bread (not on the menu but costs .99  for two good sized portions).  It was sooo good.  Again, I was expecting a premade hard piece of bread but this was warm, frehsly baked bread with the right amount of garlic and seasonings to give it flavor.  As an entree a friend and I split the fried shrimp platter.  It was pretty good!  Everything was fried to perfection and didn't taste like it had been cooked in dirty oil (I can't stand when restaurants make fries in dirty oil and you can taste it!  So disgusting!).  An added bonus to the good food was the entertainment for the kids!  I'll definitely be back since my expectations were exceeded at Rainforest Cafe!",

I got the Rainforest Burger with cheese and it was something that I could make and I have never made a burger in my life.  Flimsy on the fries, too.  Hubby got the turkey wrap with tomato basil soup.  The soup tasted like marinara sauce and the hubby said he was glad the waiter got his order wrong by only giving him half the turkey wrap.  He's usually easy to please.  My daughter barely had 2 bites of her mac/cheese.  Frame of reference: she devours the mac/cheese at Paradise Bakery  On the up side my daughter was entertained with all the sights and sounds.  The decor and ambience is fun for kids.  She really enjoyed the \"experience\" but I don't think we'd ever come here again.  Our meal ended up being $49 but that's with 15% gratuity and two drinks, too.  Pricey for a mediocre meal.  Come here for the ambience but don't expect much from the quality of food.  Meh, I've had better.  I really should've given this place 2 stars but I'm feeling generous today.",

I believe the animal/sound effects level could have been lowered in conjunction with the smaller crowd.  Other than that, us adults really enjoyed my salads.  The kids enjoyed their food too, except one of them didn't like their spaghetti because it came out as macaroni with tomato sauce.  (The server said it was spiral pasta - and it was not.)  But without a hesitation, the server brought the child a Mac & Cheese, and she liked that just fine.  They offered a special juice bottle/snack holder combo for the kid's meal drink that's included...BEWARE that thing is $9.00 !  Quite the pricey upgrade - cost more than the whole kid's meal. It's a bit excessive.  In fact, the salads were quite overpriced as well. $18.00 each.  If a consumer is looking to pay more than necessary (even if it's for much better food than I ever had in the past,) just to sit and be not-dazzled by hooting monkeys/blaring elephant robotics every 5 mins or so - then go right ahead. Treat yourself.  I'll keep this place in reserve for only very rare/special occasions.",

Upon arriving at the hostess station we were informed there was a wait and she gave us a card with a time she wrote on to come back. This was a bit surprising considering at least half the tables were empty. The time she gave us was 11:45. I checked the time on my phone and it was 11:42 which i found rather amusing. We perused the gift shop for 3 minutes and then came back at the appointed time and were seated.   We looked at our menus and quickly made our selections and then I was playing tic tac toe with my daughter and the crayons and activity book provided. We waited a long time and nobody came, not even to bring us water. By 12:05 (20 minutes) and still we hadn't been acknowledged I asked my daughter if she wished to leave and she said she was starving so we decided to go to the food court. I figured if they were that slow in taking our order our food would be probably an hour or more. I looked around and other diners appeared to be in the same predicament so we just got up and walked out. Never again.",

It's a pricey outing and the ambiance and service is the reason for our coming back.  Don't get me wrong, they make a great burger but at $14 it's the most expensive I think I ever had. My wife and I usually split one and after tip it's still a $50 experience after feeding 2 kids as well. I think if their pricing was more in line with other restaurants we would visit even more. I found the other dishes to be mediocre at best so I stick with the burger now each time.  Every 15 minutes there is a thunderstorm and all the animals freak out. It's really cute but VERY little kids may find it a bit scary. Mine used to but now at ages 7 and 10 they absolutely love it.  In conclusion it's a really fun restaurant but VERY expensive and the food is only so so.. service has been fantastic every visit so tip well!

You can go to another restaurant and POSSIBLY pay a couple bucks less, but you will not leave that restaurant with the same LIFETIME MEMORIES that you will leave with when you leave Rainforest Cafe!!! Be sure to take some pictures!!!  They offer so MANY choices on the kid's menu, including dinosaur shaped chicken, shrimp, grilled chicken, hot dogs, burgers, grilled cheese, chicken quesadilla, mac and cheese, spaghetti AND pizza! The kids can circle the picture of their choice on top, circle a the picture of their side choice and then circle their drink choice. The menu is careful not to make it obvious that sodas are an option for a drink. It is in small print and kids might not notice. If soda is okay with you, just know it is an option. The same goes for French fries and mac and cheese as sides. They offer the healthy options in pictures. My kid was disappointed to later note that fries were an option. Next time we know.   Our server, Christalyn, was SPOT ON!!! She is a very attentive and efficient server!! When I asked for extra lemon, she brought enough the first time! That is so rare!! When I ask for LOTS of lemon, never does the server bring enough, usually just two slivers. My kid likes to drown his chicken and shrimp in lemon. He ordered the Shrimpkens which is popcorn shrimp and dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets!! He LOVED his food!!! It was fun AND tasty!!  We LOVED the experience 100%!!! Rare that we give a dining experience 100%!! There is so much love that is put into creating this special spot!! From the gorillas who come to life, to the elephants that come to life, to the inside large wall waterfall, to the thunderstorms, to the butterfly to the amazing attention to detail, this place DELIVERS on ALL LEVELS!! On our way out, we were all literally pointing out different things that we didn't notice on the way in!! It took us a while to get out as we were so in awe with so many things to observe!! Basically EVERY INCH from floor to ceiling is covered in interesting decor!! Even the TABLES and the BOOTHS are covered in interesting jungle related materials! It is a mini retreat from reality!!  Our food was hot, fresh and did NOT disappoint!! We ordered the onion rings and they were tasty!! It came with ranch dip and another dip. I was eating the red spicy ketchup type dip (not sure what it was) with my fork as it was unique and tasty!! I ordered fried fish and French fries. I have honestly had better fried fish, but there fried fish was very good!! No complaints from me!! I would order it again. The tarter sauce was good and the fries were skin on, hot, fresh and awesome!!   Ignore the whiners and give this place a try!! You might just decide that you are going to eat there as often as we plan to do so!! We have already made a plan to return this weekend and bring friends along!!",

    "text": "The Rainforest Cafe is so nostalgic! I was visiting Phoenix with some time to kill at the mall so I figured why not indulge in some tropical drinking & faux rain storms. The location is basically the same as any other with lots of plastic animals and fun gimmicks. I sat at the bar and was easily able to find a spot. I adored their animal themed bar stools.   To start I had the featured Mule. It was packed with just enough liquor and I liked the fruity touch. For food I had the fish & chips, which was actually really good. I wasn't expecting much, but the breading was very flavorful and crunchy. I also enjoyed the large portion size.  Overall this place is great for a few drinks being hectic shopping, but it is overpriced for what you get. I think the next time I'll be back is actually with some children.",

Service was friendly and the atmosphere was super cool.  Best part - it was truly gluten free because my kid didn't get sick right after eating.",

However, my fork and spare plate (see pictures) were dirty. Fajitas were good and filling. Wait time for food was long and dishes did not come out at same time for everyone. Price was expensive, but not ridiculous considering the cool experience and quality of food. All in all, I will probably be back because the kids love it.",

I could have gotten a better burger at Village Inn. I will say this about the staff though, they were friendly and everyone that worked the tables was hustling. The dining areas were clean and there was sort of a Disneyland feel to the atmosphere.  Kids would love this place for the decor and the campy/gimmicky environment, but it's not what I would consider a relaxing place to spend an afternoon. The music was really loud (and I mean really LOUD), but that was offset by the annoying animal noises that was integrated into the crappy sound system. It's supposed to be a rain forest, yes, I get it...need animal noises to complete the illusion, but does the soundtrack have to drown out all conversation? The only thing missing were members of an indigenous South American tribe trying to shoot curare-dipped darts into the necks of every patron trying to munch down their meal in peace.  We skipped dessert because of the loud music and couldn't get out of there fast enough. I bet there's a high turnover with the staff; from their perspective, I couldn't imagine spending more than 4 hours in there without suffering from permanent hearing loss or wishing there was a curare dart around for some relief.",

We went during the week for lunch and there were a ton of open tables, but had to wait 20 minutes before we could be seated.   The hostess gave me a card with the time to return. My kids really wanted to eat there and I told them we would, otherwise I would have eaten anywhere else. I would have chosen the mexican restaurant across the way, but I promised my kids. They love it there.  Once we were seated the server seemed like we were annoying here just being there. The table was dirty and there was stuff all over the floor. I had to ask the server if they could wipe down the table.  Service was slow and so was the food coming out. We were never checked on and I had to ask another service if we could get a refill on our drinks. I hate that it has gone down hill so badly in the last few years. I feel like the service, lack of food, and quality has not been the same. I really hope they turn it around since it is a great restaurant inside. I would hate for it to close.   Even though we live in Tucson anytime we pass through Phoenix or there visiting my kids always ask to go there. So we go a few times a year.",

The Arizona location was a much different experience. We were seated at 'table 8' which is located just outside the restroom. I explained we had driven an hour to get here and celebrate my birthday, was there another table available- we were told no and that it would be an hour wait if we did not accept this table- fine we accepted the table. Apparently 3 large travel buses unloaded just prior to our arrival and they were the service priority. We had to ask for napkins and table ware and no way could we get drink refills. Food was just bad. Tasted like mayonnaise on the chicken tacos- yuck !!  ONE AND DONE, will not be back.",

I thought the whole atmosphere of the \"rainforest\" was so cool! Everywhere you looked it was beautifully setup, there were animals, and stars that lit up the ceiling. Then every once in awhile thunder and rain sounded and the lighting changed which I thought was pretty impressive because it was interactive dining.  Their food was yummy as well. We had a chicken pasta which we split because their portions are really good big sizes. And for an appetizer we had this fresh tuna with chips. That was so good because it was served with mango and other fresh fruit which really infused the flavors! It was very good. Also, they have a bar, for the adults, and the bar stools are various animals!!! That is so cool!!! I think this is a great setting for family dining or fun dining! Everyone should visit. :)",

Hubby and I ordered the appetizer sampler and a shrimp and salmon dish on their specials menu to split. It was ample food and nice to taste a bunch of different things.

You can't blame the clueless young people who work there, as it was obvious that they've had  zero training.  This mess falls squarely on the shoulders of lazy and incompetent management....in both the front and back of the house.  I frankly didn't want to sit down in this restaurant, as it reminded me of a seedy, darkened movie theater where heaven only knows what's crawling on the floor and presumably on everything else. We were seated in a booth at a sticky table, and sure enough, there were food remnants on the greasy seats; even an entire half of what looked like a very ancient grilled cheese sandwich. I would've left had it not been for my granddaughter, who was thrilled at seeing the elephants. (hence, the 1 star)  We waited forever to be greeted by a server, even though at 5 p.m. there were only 3 other parties seated; one party of 5 children and 2 adults, and two parties of 2.  If the front of the house is this bad, then you have to wonder if the kitchen management is equally lacking. Guess what? It is. I thought it'd be safe to order a salad. Think again! The lettuce was warm and limp and sitting in puddle of watery dressing w/ zero flavor. I would bet my life that the chicken, which topped the 'salad', came from a can; slithery, rubbery and with a sickening, plastic sheen.  I actually shuddered when I saw it. If you can't grill a chicken breast - please take it OFF the menu.  This place needs an overhaul, big time.",

Definitely not a place for a couple looking to enjoy the evening.",

I went here with work since the students were studying the rainforest and how to behave in a restaurant. The service was sloooow, we were there for about 2 hours. The food came out far apart...making some of the kids upset. The food itself was nothing special. I had some mashed potatoes and clam chowder. Chowder was like the stuff you get out of the can... the mashed potatoes were ok, but gluey. The main issue with this place are their prices. They are insanely overpriced. You can't get an adult meal for less than 12$ and those meals are basic sandwiches... the entrees were about 20$... even for pasta.... craziness. Even their entree salads were 15$. I would not come back here.",

We (4 guests)went here to celebrate my cousin in laws 10th birthday and I felt that I could have prepared her a better meal at home. The wait was painfully long throughout our entire visit. There wasn't a hostess available to organize seating (about 5 staff members walked by our line and looked away). We waited 15 minutes to get iced water.  The plate was hotter than my food. My meal was warm at best. And we waited another 15 minutes to receive a check for our dinner after multiple requests. I would rather go to the food court next time than to repeat a visit here. Side note... There aren't even fish in their tanks! Sad day.",

I'll also add that I had bought and paid cash for a Rain Forest Cafe gift card, and Landry's Select Club con place of business  refuses to add points to my membership because I used a gift card that I paid up front for, NOT at a Landry's rip-off restaurant. They said I would have to buy gift cards from them. They are nice restaurants, but in reality the food is not all that good, to actually spend as much money as they charge.  After this I'll never step foot in another Landry's restaurant, its not worth it what the food and drinks costs.  Lots of bad reviews here and what happened to us is just one explanation as to why.",

We even got a seat next to one of the saltwater tanks which was amazing! The food is a bit pricey for the quality, but not bad. Remember you are paying for the atmosphere.

The wait staff was not kind at all. We were not looking to make friends with the waiter but looking to at least have good service. We asked for a cup of ice water and the waiter bought me a cup with a splash on lemonade with water. The water had a cloudy look and you could clearly taste that there was a water lemonade mix. The waiter wanted to give push back on this drink. All the food that we ordered was horrible. They have changed up the menu and removed a lot of our favorites. We do realize times have changed so the menu has to change but please replace it with foods that are good and makes sure your cooks know what they are doing! Rain Forest in the Mills has gone way down as to why we can no longer visit this location. Maybe they are closing soon",

    "text": "Being the only location in Arizona the Rainforest Cafe at the Arizona Mills Mall automatically earns itself a positive reputation. However, the restaurant's success and appeal are also a result of the restaurant's fun-oriented atmosphere as well as its individuality.  As mentioned earlier, Rainforest Cafe is located at the Arizona Mills Mall in Tempe, a large mall different from other malls in Arizona. There are plenty of things to do here because the mall is home to a Harkins IMAX movie theater and a Gameworks in addition to all of the stores. The assortment of available activities makes the mall a good place to plan an entire day of events. This is exactly what my girlfriend and I did for our one-year anniversary; we started off the day with a meal at the Rainforest Cafe, strolled around the mall for a while, and then saw a movie at the Harkins. All in all, it proved to be an entertaining day, and the highlight of it was our fun-filled visit to the Rainforest Cafe.  The setting of the Rainforest Cafe is similar to that of an amusement park rather than a regular restaurant, and is the main reason that people choose to visit here. The restaurant was designed to look like a tropical rainforest, and is filled with artificial trees, animatronic animals, and large aquariums filled with live fish. Fake fog and thunderstorms add to the wild vibe, and provide an entertaining environment different from other locales. Because of its similarity to amusement parks such as Disneyland, the Rainforest Cafe is popular among families and teenagers looking to have a good time. As a result, the restaurant is often filled with loud, energetic children, which can be annoying but also adds to the overall mood because their antics are similar to those of the electronic gorillas that periodically cause an uproar in their of the restaurant. Besides, since most of the people dining at the restaurant are there to have a good time, it does little to disturb their visit.  In terms of service, Rainforest Cafe is just average; they often appear rushed and a little confused, which is understandable because the restaurant is always so busy. However, they are always friendly and willing to help, making up for their overwhelmed service.  The only fault of the Rainforest Cafe is the pricing, which is a little excessive considering that the majority of the items are of common quality. But the prices are not so extreme that they take away from the restaurant's appeal because the unique experience offered by this location is worth paying a little extra.",

They have no healthy options on their kids menu and it's not much better on the regular menu. I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept. But the service is way too slow! The number one thing that I look for when bringing kids out to eat is fast service. It's no secret that kids have no patience for waiting 15+ minutes for a check. And happy kids equal happy customers. Crying and winy kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers. So speed it up at least please!",

Our sever was a bit obnoxious, nothing in particular, he was just kind of annoying. The food was blah. The menu itself is boring and like any other boring restaurant. You'd think that they'd have more fun or exotic recipes being that it's the Rainforest Cafe but nope, they had a few sandwiches, some salads, a few burgers, some fish items, etc... pretty boring. If it hadn't been for the free gift card we had we probably wouldn't be back. Go elsewhere. There are plenty of places that are far better.

For a $200 bill I didn't realize we would have to beg so much for re-fills and correct food.

On our drive home from Las Vegas, we decided to stop in Tempe and treat our 5 year old to lunch at Rainforest Cafe, thinking he would really enjoy it. (Nope.)  The wait was about thirty minutes to get in. The line was all the way from the restaurant to the front of the store, even though half the tables were empty.  The menu was disappointing. The selection is thoroughly \"meh\" and the prices are astronomical. $14 for a mediocre burger? Imagine my surprise at experiencing sticker shock in Tempe after just coming from Las Vegas, land of overpriced food. I ordered a cheesesteak that turned out to be some hard bread stuffed with an overabundance of lettuce and tomatoes. I guess they were trying to make up for the lack of both cheese and steak. To make matters worse, the wait for our food seemed unreasonably long.  If you're coming here, chances are it's for the atmosphere and not the food. That's good, because the food is not. I've given this place enough chances. We will not be returning.",

No fish in the fish tanks, half the animals were only partially working, and the fountain smelled of something terrible. It's amazing how quickly a location can go downhill when the owners skimp on proper maintenance. They need to recognize quickly that the sole reason people come to this place is all the things they're cutting in their budgets. If they want to be another Chilis or Applebees then they need to price accordingly. The current prices are extreme given that it is no longer a destination for anything other than food.",

    "text": "Headed here after seeing a movie at the Harkins located inside the same mall. We were interested in checking out the menu first since we weren't sure if this one had the same offerings we were used to from the Orlando location we went to from time to time.    After looking over the menu we decided that we could all find something we wanted to eat here and we were brought a few more menus after a bit. I ordered the Cobb Salad, he had the Turkey BLT Club and our friend had the Quesadilla. The Cobb Salad had a lot of toppings on it and it was well-made, but it was really covered in dressing to a point that it was all you tasted. If we ever go back, I'll definitely request that on the side.  The Club sandwich my husband had was sandwiched with bread that was toasted to a point it wasn't really edible, so he took everything out of it and at that, which kinda defeats the purpose of a sandwich altogether. The insides of the Club were fresh and tasty though and the fries that came with it were good as well.    Took awhile to get things from our waitress during almost every step of the meal. Which seemed a little odd considering we went during an off time and it wasn't too busy.  Overall: B- Probably wouldn't recommend it to people with all the other options in the food court just around the corner...but not a bad place if you are looking to entertain little ones.",

It seems that my family liked their food. Now my dish on the other hand, I feel that they could step up the game. From the looks of their prices, a 13.99 plate is your low end if you are not ordering for a child. I had the chicken sandwich. It reminded me of a Domino's sandwich. But I would prefer a Domino's sandwich over this one. I was also hoping they could spice up the fries. Due to my overall experience, I am giving them a kind 4 star due to their service and atmosphere. They also hooked my wife up with a complimentary birthday cupcake. For me personally, their food yesterday was a 3 star at best.",

However, I called and made a reservation and was informed that the wait for food was only about 15 minutes. We ordered the steak and shrimp, pasta Bolognese, kids mac & cheese, and French onion soup. All of the food was excellent and full of flavor! The prices we're reasonable considering the atmosphere and entertainment provided. They also had waiters come to our table and sing happy birthday. We opted in for the \"birthday package\" which was full of great gifts. It included a memorable plate, canteen, binoculars , sunglasses, canopy hat etc. we all had a wonderful time and enjoyed our food it very much. We definitely will be back for another celebration! The team members were very positive and happy and the manager was wonderful! Great job!",

We were told that they waitress in that area was not willing to take more tables. So we got a crappy seat :(    Next: our waitress was nice and attentive and came by often to ask us about refills. But when I ask for a Long Island ice tea, I was told that she wasn't sure if they were going to be able to make it and if they did there would be an extra charge (not sure for what). When I got the drink the drink was water down and not tasty at all. She took it back and brought me a new one! Very nice of her but it's still nasty.   In general our food was good but very pricey and were charge for every single condiments that probably measure a tea spoon at max. The food was ok and the presentation of it was ok also. But I will most likely not comeback and spend $180 in dinner.",

The waitress was horrible and occasionally stopped by rushing of without really listening. This is the second time this occurred so it wasn't just a one off thing, it seem to be status quo. She asked me about a Landry card and then took 25 minutes to check to see if I was registered. When she could not find the info under my name I said I would sign up because of the other restaurant like Claim Jumper, she forgot to let me know it was $25 to join and said \"I just figured you knew since you thought you had a card before\".  The food was horrible, the tomato soup had seeds in it, the Alfredo sauce was brown and the seafood was over cooked. The drinks were too sweet and we were charged a different amount than was listed on the menu. 1st time could have been a fluke, 2nd time proved this is how they operate and evidently it is acceptable since no manager attempted to check on us but to add the $25 for the Landry card.

We also asked for more forks, as our daughter had dropped 2. He got everything down and left. Minutes later, a manager came over and asked about my allergy. I was happy that they took it seriously. He told me there was gluten in the scampi butter. He said they could give me grilled shrimp with melted butter on the side. That sounded good so I went with that. Then, we waited, and waited, and waited. After about 15 min, our waiter came and asked how we were doing. I said fine, but could I please have my club soda. He went and got it and apologized profusely. Then, we waited and waited and waited. It was about a 40 minute wait before our food arrived. We still didn't have any forks. We asked for forks, ketchup, and I asked for my melted butter. He left and returned with forks, ketchup, and a dollop of cold butter in a side dish. I told him it was supposed to be melted but I'd just make do. We also asked for more napkins which never came. Not once were we offered refills on our water or club soda. It was like he didn't even try. It just wasn't worth it. We won't be eating there again.",

I ordered the \"Taste of the Islands\" and the \"blackened tilapia\" was not blackened and was room temp.  My mashed potatoes were room temp and not very soft.  The scallops were hot-ish, and the shrimp which came late was not all that hot.      The way overpriced menu is apparently for the environment, which is falling apart.  The huge fish tank is now fishless, which also took away from the environment.       I would not recommend this place at all.  If you're hungry, go to the food court, you'll get better quality and most likely hot food.",

The rain forest vibe was awesome. The fake storms and animal noises were unique for a dining experience. The scenery is the only reason I gave this review a star.  We looked at the menu and it seemed a little pricey but I did not care because I was hungry and figured I was paying for the environment. We waited....waited.....and waited. No one came by to take our order or offer us drinks. After 30 minutes of sitting there without any service, we left and went to another place in the mall to eat.   Sadly, after reading the other reviews I see that there are many problems other than what we encountered. I don't think I will return until whoever runs this establishment learns how to manage and run a restaurant effectively.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is pretty loud. It's a cute little rainforest theme with animatronic elephants and gorillas that periodically come to life. Most kids at the few tables there liked it. My daughter wasn't scared at all until this kid about her age started freaking out at the next table.   The food is decent for adults. Amazing? No.   My little one had the kids pizza. It looked like some crappy frozen pizza stuck on a cafeteria plate with broccoli and orange slices. The cheese on the pizza had coagulated into a tepid cardboard like triangle with pepperoni on it. She only liked the steamed broccoli and oranges. -I'm sure they don't try to serve piping hot pizza to kids in the event their parent is irresponsible and the kid burns themselves, but my kiddo doesn't like almost cold pizza  I had a combination plate. It's not pretty like the picture. I was super hungry so I didn't take a picture of it. It looks less appetizing. But, it's not terrible. I liked the bacon wrapped shrimp with jalapenos. Those were pretty delicious. I'd eat that again. There was a white fish topped with mango salsa. I can't remember the type of fish, probably tilapia. It was not really great or worth remembering. The temperature was weird, probably because it was sitting too long before being brought out so the cold mango salsa had time to cool the about 3/4\" thick piece of fish almost all the way through, so it was lukewarm on the part that touched the grill plate. There was also a salsa topped chicken and grilled veggies. I loved the grilled veggies. I'm a huge fan of perfectly seasoned & grilled zucchini. The chicken was cooked well, which is definitely good. I asked for no cheese on the chicken, with which they complied.   Overall, if it wasn't as expensive, and service was better, I'd be more inclined to go back. It wasn't the worst service ever, but I had time to box up 2 meals and stand up and wait with my kiddo while about 5-7 servers were averting their eyes and dodging my table so no one would feel \"obligated\" to run my card so I could hurry and leave. I think I had to wait about 10 minutes for him to come back and get my card when he could have waited less than 15 seconds for me to put my card in and take the tab. The place was not busy, either. If the tables were full, it would have been different. If you're not in any rush, it's really not a bad place to eat at.",

I've never had bad experiences at the Downtown Disney and Las Vegas locations. This location back in the 90s was actually pretty great. The start of our experience was great, our server got and drinks and apps out in good time. After we placed our food order things went down hill fast.  We had been waiting for our food for over an hour and the restaurant didn't have every single table full of people, we were actually surrounded by a bunch of empty tables. When we could finally track down our ever-absent waitress we asked her to cancel our food order and we just wanted to pay the remainder of our bill so that we could go somewhere else. Our request prompted the manager to come over and apologize. I told her we were out for our sister's birthday and wanted to have a good time but we were so disappointed in the wait and lack of service. She offered to take 50% off our bill and still bring us our food but we just wanted the bill so we could leave. I get the bill about 10-15 minutes later and all she took off was the food, no additional discount was on the bill. I was so fed up with the situation I didn't even care . The prices are insanely high at a place like this but you go for the experience and the fun atmosphere....well I paid a stupid price for some appetizers and a cruddy experience.",

The atmosphere is awesome, and they seated us right next to the gorillas, which my kids of course just loved.   You are paying for the experience, so you really can't complain about the price of the meals.  But... if you are paying for the experience... they could try to keep some actual fish in the fish tanks. All of the fish tanks were empty, which was really weird.  They had water in them, but we looked, and there were no actual fish. (Unless they were ALL hiding, but that seems unlikely).   A few other things:  The kids menu has \"fruit\" as an option, but in Arizona in the summer, that's just orange slices. I kind of feel like they could do better or list orange slices as a specific option. I ordered the nachos, and I asked them to do real shredded cheese instead of cheese sauce. This doesn't seem like an odd request to me, but the person who made them must have never actually eaten nachos before, because they were SO covered in cheese, and the cheese was so overcooked, it was like eating rubber cheese with chips stuck in it. Really weird. Hard to pull the chips out of the cheese layer and kind of hard to eat. And strangely greasy, especially since I ordered them without meat.  Should be served with a side of salsa, but they aren't -- just the pico de gallo that is on them, which is chunky, not saucy.   I will come back, but only because my kids don't really care about the mediocre food. They think it's a fun place to be.",

However the servers are very polite and I have noticed that they do work together to help out each other.   Some of the food is good and some of it needs salt or some type of flavor. I would suggest the chicken salad sandwich, any of the appetizers,  the guacamole burger, and Caribbean coconut shrimp. Oh! They also got a new item on the menu which is really surprising and good, the \"Ozzie Omelet.\" Loved it!  The gift shop is full of cool stuff! I always see new items when I go which is awesome.  There is also an employee always greeting people walking in which is nice but can sometimes be annoying.   The bathroom is a bit small but still fits the rainforest theme. Sometimes it is really dirty but I do not understand how people leave paper towels on the sink...there is a trash can in the bathroom.   Overall love this place and it is way better then the one in Vegas! :)",

There are more spoiled little kids running around then chuckee cheese, service was not good and took forever on a slow afternoon. Food was seriously lacking flavor. They don't have prices marked for their booze so I ordered a beer that came to be in a 12oz bottle and was charged $5. The only good thing about this place is the decor, if they replaces all the prices, ingridients, service, and spoiled kids it might be ok. But if you go here with a 2 person party and get the cheapest burgers on the menu, you are basically paying almost $50 to stare at fish and robotic elephants. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.

Aside from the fact that the roof leaks and you're constantly in danger of being electrocuted, none of the staff seem at all versed in the features or options of the parrots. Are the roosts sold separately? How much for the whole tree? Can my parrot be \"taught\" new bawdy phrases to delight my friends?   And when you press them on the issue, they try to divert your attention away from your seemingly simple mission by plying you with alcohol and the shittiest microwaved snacks you can imagine. I mean, it seems like a nice gesture to give you something to nibble on while you wait for a Senior Parrot Specialist to come to your assistance and close the sale; but in the end you just end up wet, hammered, food poisoned and parrotless.  [ UPDATE: When checking my online banking later, I noticed they charged me for the food and drinks! I thought it was complimentary and they just wanted my credit card to put down a deposit on my birdie. What a racket. ]",

    "text": "I would give it less if I could.  I have been here once before about 6 or 7 years ago.  At that time I thought I wouldn't be back, it was dirty and smelt weird and the food wasn't good.  Well a long time has passed and we went for a friends birthday.  We ordered apps and waited for a while for those. They where decent not great but decent.  Next comes the food.  The waiter sets the food in front of me and on my plate of chicken parm there is a plastic bag with pasta and sauce in it.  The bag is marked Sunday and it was Wednesday.  I looked at it, laughed a little to myself then pointed it out to the rest of the table.   We flagged down the waiter and showed him the plate. He took it back grumbled something and walked away with it.  Came back out 2 minutes later with the pasta dumped out of the bag onto my plate.  Being it was my friends birthday I didn't want to complain too much so I ate some of my chicken and didn't touch the pasta (in hind sight I shouldn't have eaten anything).  My husband wasn't happy with what happened and flagged down the waiter on my behalf to ask him how old the pasta was. We wanted to know if it was good until Sunday or was it made on Sunday and are now serving it on Wednesday. The waiter started talking about him being and pharmacy tech or something like that and didn't answer the question.  So my husband asked to talk to the manager.  The Manager comes back to the table about 15 minutes after we asked to talk to him and after everyone else is done eating.  He came up defensive and making excuses about company policy. They make pasta 2 times a week and portion it in little bags add sauce and microwave.  It isn't like I expect to have great fresh food at a place like Rainforest Cafe but pasta 4 days old? It isn't like it is hard to cook or takes a long time.  Needless to say I will never ever go to the restaurant again. I am glad what I did eat didn't make me sick.  After my experience I checked the board of health sight and it is scary!!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maricopa.gov%2Fenvsvc%2Fenvwebapp%2Ftabs%2Fresults.aspx%3FnavigatedFrom%3DbusinessResultsDrillDown%26mc_perm_id%3D51696%26business%3DRAINFOREST%2520CAFE%26address%3D5000%2520%2520%2520ARIZONA%2520MILLS%2520CIR%26permitid%3DSG31025&s=ed03b0d7e8d63f17af8bb21ecffc279b83baf1ed291da573ff5102c2eb486d72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">maricopa.gov/envsvc/envw...</a>   Think  twice before going to this place.",

It took 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and the person who took the drink orders brought our kids (3 & 5) their drinks in adult cups.  The server finally made an appearance, acknowledged the long wait and said she would send a manager over.  This never happened.  She took our order and then we had to wait anther 25 minutes for the food to come out.  When the server said the food would be out in a minute and I asked what was taking so long to cook it, she snapped at me stating that she just told me that it would be right out.  My wife's Asian Shrimp Salad was soggy and the shrimp were cold, as if it had been sitting for some time.  My meal, the Ribs Steak Shrimp Trio was OK except for the issue that the steak was cooed to barely medium when I asked for medium well...25 minutes for a medium rarish steak?  The manager was apologetic and took my meal off the bill.  He then offered several times sundaes to the kids.  I was angry we still had to pay for this meal at all given the issues.  This is not the first time we have had these issues at this restaurant.  Although the kids love it, we have explained to them that we will no longer be going to this restaurant.",

We'll start from the beginning:   The atmosphere was nice for the \"jungle\" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night.

Very kid friendly.  My husband, 10 month old and myself went there yesterday and our food really wasn't that great.  We were greeted nicely and seated pretty quickly, however, we waited for some time before we were finally approached by our server and asked what we wanted to drink. We started with the chili con queso dip and it wasn't anything special, it was good, but it could have used some sprucing up on the flavor. I ordered my little one the pasta with marinara and applesauce and my husband and I ordered the chicken marinara. We waited a long time for our food!  First of all let me say the portion for the child pasta was huge!!! Even for an older child!!! I could have eaten it myself and been full!!  The pasta was cooked al dente, which honestly I didn't expect, most places over cook the pasta which is good for my daughter as she doesn't have any back teeth yet.  I gave her two very small bites then had to return it for a grilled cheese because she kept gagging on the pieces since she couldn't chew them with the pasta being to al dente.  The waitress accommodated and even took the pasta off the check, yay!!   The grilled cheese took forever to come out, I was questioning how long does it take to make a grilled cheese, be it was good, I tried it myself ;)  Our food was ok.  The chicken was cooked perfectly but had way to much cheese melted on top for my liking.  There were two chicken breasts on the plate, pretty good size, for sure over the recommended daily protein intake.  There was a small portion of pasta also.  The sauce was kinda blah, tasted a little like jarred sauce and pretty garlicky..and thats saying something because I love garlic!!  Our bill was $70.00 with tip and all we ordered were our meals, two drinks, the appetizer and kids meal!!! Way too pricey for low to mediocre food.  My daughter really seemed to enjoy the atmosphere and loved the opportunity to be loud, but I don't think we will be back anytime soon.",

I have waited a long time to try a Rainforest Cafe and I was really disappointed!  The food around us did not look appealing so we ordered the appetizer platter.  The artichoke spinach dip was so thick and overcooked that the chips kept breaking.  The mozzarella sticks were overcooked and the cheese was rubbery. The chicken egg roll things were awful and had some kind of funky sauce. The chicken tenders were probably the most edible thing on the plate.  I still think for $15.99 this appetizer plater was not a deal!  We had also called and made a reservation for a booth by the waterfall and of course when we got there there were no booths left! So don't waste your time with reservations!  I really would like to say something nice about the place but between the food and service, I won't be back!!",

Service was less than stellar everytime before this time, but we thought we would give it another shot because the concept of the restaurant out daughter enjoys. We were seated and waited 10 minutes before we were asked about ordering drinks, but it was at this time we also ordered an appetizer for our table. We waited, and waited for our appetizer. We noticed that two tables down from us they received the same appetizer that we had ordered, and it sat on their table for about 10 minutes before the waitress came back and let her know that they did not order the nachos. So back to the kitchen they go, in the meantime, out waitress goes back to check on our apps. About 5 minutes later, out comes a manager with a plate of ice cold nachos, which one has to assume probably came from the other table. We pointed this out to him, he took off to check on getting more, in the meantime we decided to leave. While were gathering our things, our meal showed up, but still no appetizer. No thanks guys, we will go elsewhere! To top or off, they didn't even comp our sodas or apologize for anything. I will never step foot in their again! All of these bad reviews are right on! Poor service and management!! Don't waste your time or money!",

    "text": "This place would be cool if I was really into mechanical animals. Or five years old.  The Rainforest Cafe is just a little overpriced in my opinion and it's a themed restaurant filled with little animals that move every few minutes while you eat.  I think you hear thunder and rain and mist falls on diners every now and then.  For kids, this place would be great.  Especially for birthday parties- I'd definitely plan a bash here if I had kids.  But I don't, so I won't be going back to the Rainforest cafe with their animated gorillas and mysterious smog anytime soon.",

    "text": "This place was a laugh!.....in a good way.....we had just ordered when a simulated lighting storm occurred....the lights were flashing, thunder was booming and all of the animatronics were screeching......We just had to try this place as I had never experienced anything like this in Australia....the restaurant came complete with a night sky with twinkling stars, a fog machine around the bar, huge tropical fish tanks and bar stools in the shape of animal rears and feet!.....Our waitress was great.....and the food was good.....we did not expect 5 star dining as clearly this is the last place you would go if you were feeling 5 star....it is essentially for children but we had fun as we still have a lot of child in us. My husband had the coconut shrimp which was actually very good and I had the English style fish and chips which I have to say was not very English but the fish was very tasty. Great for a casual bite and to entertain the children......not sure if you want to take very young young children here though as it can get quite noisy and some of the very young ones looked quite concerned!",

    "text": "Very exciting place for everyone to try and experience, but the kids really love it. My little one had a great time. We got there about 5 pm for an early dinner and it was not as crowded as usual. The service was great and the food was once again amazing. I went with a turkey wrap, which was very good. I have tried many things there and everything is always great. If you get a chance TRY the clam chowder.  EXCELLENT!! I would go back just for the soup.  We also ordered the mushroom raviolis, which were also amazing and a must try,  I was upset I was not the one that ordered them. All in all I cannot say one bad thing about Rainforest Cafe. Final portion of the night that basically made our experience over the top was the fact that our waitress continued checking on our meal.  From what the manager told us and I failed to realize because we were having such a good time enjoying the scenery, was that our food was about ten minutes later then it was suppose to be.  The manager came out and apologized without us even knowing why and discounted our meal.  I would have been happy with him just letting us know that it is running a little late, but the over the top service and extra mile effort was fantastic.  I must have caught them on a great day from some of the reviews I have read.  5 stars for sure and a must Yelp!!",

    "text": "I took my 3 yr old son here on Monday since we were in the area and wanted to take him some place fun. I've been to the rain forest cafe in the past so I knew what to expect. First its Monday afternoon at 1 pm. Not busy but for some reason I had to stand and wait 10 minutes for the hostess to seat my son and I next to the rest rooms, best table in the house. My son is a picky eater he chooses the mini cheese burgers and I'm not feeling that hungry so I chose the hot wings appetizer. When ordering the wings I ask the waitress if the wings are they a mild flavor or hot. She didn't know hmmm ok. I like spicy food so won't bother me. Food arrived rather quickly, the wings over battered and soggy. Seriously after biting into the 3rd Wing I almost sent it back, but didn't want to cause a fuss in front of my son. My son's mini cheeseburgers were actually full size cheese burgers, way too big for a 3 yr old. So I guess the portion size for the kids menu is good. I tried my sons min cheese burger, I can honestly say I know good cheeseburgers and I know when restaurants use frozen patties and this was a frozen patty, no flavor. I didn't come to Rain Forest Cafe expecting good food and I didn't receive any. I do like the atmosphere and my son really enjoyed it. My suggestion to Rain Forest Cafe improve food quality and pricing. Food way over priced for the quality.",

    "text": "I'm kicking myself for not checking the reviews before going to the Rainforest Cafe. I thought it'd be a fun place to eat before I took my friend back to the airport to catch her flight. We were seated quickly, which was nice. But one look at the menu and I was already seeing a red flag. $13 for a chicken sandwich! A chicken sandwich! Clearly I was playing for the atmosphere. I finally decided on a pasta dish that the waitress recommended. The place was pretty loud... and pretty dirty. Trash was all over the floor. Who knows? Maybe they had just had a lunch rush before we got there? Either way I was not impressed. My food came out in reasonable time, and it did look good. I wish I could remember what it was called, because I was not impressed by the flavor. At all. The only edible part was the sausage that came with it. I finally got the nerve to tell the manager that it was terrible and sent the dish back to the kitchen. He offered to make me something else, but by that time my friend needed to go back to the airport. The only good thing is they didn't make me pay for it. My friend says the chicken sandwich was okay, but I will never take a friend back there again. Or myself. If you're looking for a rainforest like place that uses mechanical animals to entertain/scare the children, go ahead and try it out, but If you're looking for a good meal I suggest finding some place else.",

    "text": "Average. This experience was not better or worse than my last Rainforest Cafe moment. The aquarium was nice; but the speakers for the thunder effects were way too loud and often interrupted, not complimented the experience. Our server made four visits including to collect the check. They were clearly understaffed on this Saturday night. The food quality was again, average. Overall the atmosphere was alive & well, but not as epic as a RF experience should be. Love the other review that equated the thunderstorm experience to a Safeway produce section. So True!",

Personally, most of the menu doesn't interest me but their hamburgers are really pretty awesome. Wish they had more locations in AZ. Their location in Anaheim at Downtown Disney is way better of course :)",

    "text": "Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.",
