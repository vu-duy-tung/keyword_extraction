    "text": "This review could be very long as I've been eating here since  it's original, original location was on 35th Ave S. of McDowell (yup I'm that old school). However I'm going to try to keep it short. This place is THE measuring stick I use to measure all other Sonoran Mexican fare. I love the shredded beef tacos. When I'm craving a good taco this is where I head. I'm totally known to come in & order one shredded beef taco with a diet Pepsi & then eat my weight in the chips & salsas. The fajitas are delicious & served hot & sizzling. This place has the best Sonoran Enchiladas. I get them without meat & don't tell my Mom but they are better then hers. The take out is where I get my fave dinner salad in town. I know it's not Mexican fare but I eat it with my Mexican fork the tortilla chip so that makes it Mexican right? Well in any case when you're having a craving for Sonoran Mexican food this is the THE place. I don't reccomend any Garcia's location but the original as you will be disappointed after eating at the original.  Tip - make sure & ask for the hot sauce when they bring the chips as for some reason they stopped bringing that automatically with the salsa.",

I love nice people and I'm always so impressed by it in customer service because unfortunately it seems it's few and far between nowadays. More people should love their jobs and enjoy their customers it makes for a better day for everyone. I know because I have worked worth the public for 20 plus years. Anyways sorry for the rant, lol. She was awesome and made me want to come back. The food was good all we got was chips and fried ice cream but both were yummy as usual. The fried ice cream could have used a tad more honey but still good. Love this place and love that I live close and can get drive thru good that isn't fast food. Plus the prices are a tad lower than the actual restaurant.",

You don't see a lot of high-difficulty stuff on the menu, and it's pretty much a different combination of beans, rice, tortilla and your choice of meat.   I did try the taco salad one afternoon and it was fairly decent.     If in this part of Phoenix though, it's really the only option - not much to pick from around there.",

The staff at the hostess desk made today's wait horrible!! I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant before but we did today. When we first arrived we were told the wait would be 45-60 minutes. After waiting for 75 minutes we asked how much longer it would be. We were told there were 6 groups still ahead of us. Again we waited for many more groups to be seated. We noticed they were sitting groups of 4-9. Again we asked and were again told there were 6 groups ahead of us. again we waited. Then I again asked how much longer. I was told 10 minutes. After 20 minutes I again asked why groups were being seated ahead of us that had come in after us. The hostess JEN told me that they were sittinf the larger groups first. I then asked to speak with the manager. The manager never came up. We left after waiting for 15 minutes for the manager.  After leaving my husband called to speak with the manager. After telling the manager what had happened, the manager told him that the staff had followed the manager Essie's directions. We will never return again. We even host family reunions here every year. Never again.",

    "text": "What? Only a 4 star average for this place? And only 27 reviews? Come on Phoenix!  I admit, If all I care about is the food, I'm heading to Carolina's.  However- you can't really relax at Carolina's. No one waits on you, no matter how transcendant the food is you're always hearing someone yell \"Number 27!\" \"Number 28!\". God help you if it's summer.  Garcia's, although still in the ghetto, is somewhere you can go, relax, be waited on, enjoy free chips and salsa before the meal, and enjoy a pleasant conversation friendly environment.   As for the food- I've never had a bad meal here. The rice is the best in the city. It's really moist without being wet, there are chunks of real tomatoes in it. They have dishes that you can't get just everywhere like fish dishes and my favorite, chili con carne- very similar to how my mom makes it, but they have a green version as well as a red version.    I've taken my boss from out of town here, dates... (well, escorts.. same thing...), and friends here (again... escorts, but...  )  and everyone of them were like in a happy daze afterwards. Blissed out like heroin junkies..   I think two of them were on heroin.. but still it's really really good food.   I love you Garcias Las Avenidas! Only 2 more months till my 1 year ban is lifted!

    "text": "Was looking for a good Mexican Restaurant and based off the Yelp reviews thought we would try the Original Garcia's.  First, we are seated and given chips and salsa and menus and are the only people in our area of the restaurant (it was only 4:00pm). As we sat there others were placed around us so there were about six tables full. A waiter comes out and starts taking everyone's order around us but not ours and we were the first ones there and now have been waiting about 15 minutes. I get upset but decide that he just didn't know the order we arrived and is confused so I wait. He disappears and doesn't show back up and everyone else has had their order taken but we still have not. I see the chip gal walking by and say \"can you please get our waiter?\" and she says \"she is running late and isn't here yet\". I'm like...what the hell are you talking about?  All of a sudden we see a woman in a Garcia's shirt come running by with her purse and goes into the back and puts it down and comes back to our table and says \"sorry, I was running late\". Are you kidding me? They sat me in a section and the waitress wasn't at work yet and let us sit there for 30 minutes getting pissed off and didn't take our order?  Was also disappointed in the meal as there wasn't much flavor in any dish we had and would not drive the 40 minutes again to get to this place. The salsa had no spice to it and was very unimpressed with the entire meal.  To make it worse I get out in the parking lot and some idiot has his car parked two inches from the drivers side door of my car which I don't know how he did without hitting my car. I had to enter my car through the passenger side and so much wanted to find the guy and curse him out for being an idiot but thought better of it when I remembered what neighborhood I was in.  There are better Mexican Restaurants closer to home and certainly wouldn't travel all the way to Maryvale again just to eat here.",

    "text": "Today at work we decided to order Mexican food for lunch.  Someone had mentioned Garcia's, and they also mentioned the \"best\" Garcia's.  I thought to myself, if you are talking about the Garcia's at Metro Center Mall or near Arrowhead YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!  If this is what you consider to be the \"BEST\" Garcia's than you are FAR out of line...  Somehow, I knew something was different as soon as I looked at the menu.  First, THE PRICES ARE NOT NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS THE CHAIN!!!!  I was pleasantly surprised at the cost of the combination plates.  Second, the menu stated THE ORIGINAL GARCIA'S.  Original I thought?  Hmm...something definitely was different.  Last, I found out it was located on 35th Ave and Encanto.  I knew immediately I was in for a different treat.  I placed my order, chicken flauta with rice and beans for $6.75.  Didn't expect much but was surprised when the meal arrived.    Observation One: HOLY SALSA.  I am NOT messing around!  They gave me two large salsa containers (one hot, one more pico) for my to go order.  SCORE!  But hey, where are the chips?  Observation Two:  HOLY GUACAMOLE!  Literally!  This stuff wasn't watered down with sour cream.  It didn't have an odd brown color from being too old.  It was super fresh, super delicious, and super avacado-ey.  AND, my flauta was covered in it!  Observation Three:  The flauta was fried to a perfect consistency.  The chicken was not dry, and the flauta was of a reasonable size.  The rice and beans were delicious and mildy flavored.  I added extra salsa to them to kick it up a notch.  After I ate the food I decided to go online and do a little bit of research about them.  Come to find out, the shady and lame flavors of the Garcia's I was accustomed to were from their sold brand...I now know about the authenticity of this location!  In either case, give it a try.  Delicious flavors for an affordable price!",

The bean dip, is literally just refried beans and a bit of cheese, no flavor. The chicken salad bowl had a weird taste to it and the \"chicken\" looked and smelled like tuna fish. The nachos seemed to be sitting for a while, since more than half of the chips were soggy and cold. Our family of 8 left majority of the food, since we were full from having chips and salsa. We will definitely not be coming back again.   Please save your money and enjoy the other great Mexican restaurants in the valley.",

I finally went inside to see why it was taking so long since people who had larger orders and ordered after him were given there food prior. He was basically overlooked since he was a kid. I asked one of the chola girls there if the quesadilla was going to be ready anytime soon since it had been more than an 1/2 hour she said what did you order. I said my son ordered a quesadilla but apparently he was over looked she just said oh ok she yelled back at the 3 stooges that were cooking the food and singing like they were at home laughing and just said yeah it's almost done. WOW !!  The other people waiting noticed that my son was over looked as well one of the ladies told them they should give him 2 since he had waited so long but she was ignored.   This place need to send there employees to Finishing school.",

So I never ever do this but yesterday I decided to give a \"Mexican\" restaurant a chance being 5 de Mayo and taco Tuesday I gave in.  My lovely friend and I go to Garcias Las Avenidas on 35th Ave and Encanto. The venue it's self is beautiful. The old Mexican hacienda theme took me by surprise. We waited about 45 min after being told it was only going to be 20 min. After being seated, I had to walk back to the bar because u can't have drink specials through the server you had to get them your self.   I ordered fajitas and my friend ordered enchiladas. Some of the worst \"\"Mexican\"\" food I have ever had. The cheese was gross, the crema was warm, the fajitas wer swimming in oil. The service was pathetic! None of the servers or bar tender wanted to be there. They close at 9 and don't inform you about that when you sit down at 845!!! The only good thing is the chips there! I was very upset and this is why \"Mexican\" food restaurants in my mind are the worst to go to. No one offers reeeeeal Mexican food unless it's a lonchera or a lil whole in the wall Siri can never find! Garcias is a gross display of Chicano & Tex-Mex food! The service, the food, and the over all experience suuuucked!!!!",

They are always warm, and thin, and just the right amount of salty. The salsa is okay.  I like ordering the taco steak which is chopped steak with cheese and it comes with tortillas, rice, and beans. I also like ordering the combination appetizer because you get to taste a little bit of everything. It includes 2 mini flautas, 2 mini chimis, a mini bean and cheese tostada, a tamale, and 2 mini beef tacos, all for around $10.  The restaurant is beautiful and festive. Sometimes I like to order ahead and pick up in the take out building. Like I said, it's not the best I've ever had, but I do crave those chips like nobody's business.",

Red ench next and easily done but no room for tostada. Although the food was very good it wasn't as good as I've had. Always five stars but this trip was 4****.

So they closed early and turned me away. I found that very interesting considering there were people at the bar and more vehicles in parking lot. It didn't seem \"dead\" or \"slow.\" Kinda pissed me off. I think I'll take a break from this restaurant. So, one peace of advise is to call ahead to insure they are open.

None of the original flavors are present, from the hot sauce with too much vinegar, to the chicken tacos, green chile, or even the rice.  If you're looking for old school flavors  the original Garcias used to serve back in the day, try:  Pancho's (So.Cental Ave) or their kid's place - Some Burros - The Vasquez family still does it right. TeePee - The Duran family is still serving up their original recipes since the 60's.  Try going back to your roots, it might serve you well.",

Busy or slow time and no issues. I have enjoyed \"brunch\" time on Sunday's sitting on the patio sipping a mimosa and eating Huevos Ranchero. But this past year the quality has just seemed to have gone down. The food is not as tasty as it used to be , the quality seems as if they have changed suppliers to save on cost since the textures on some of our choices has been a bit off. Two months or so we went in for dinner and the enchiladas just seemed like the cheese was thrown in and microwaved. The spicy \"Mexican\" flavors were non existent. And my husband kept pointing out the lack of cleanliness inside as well. The decorations are dusty and there were cobwebs! Ouch! Last night we went in and there was just no flavor and the tortillas for the enchiladas tasted old :( There are other places to try.  I'm still looking that great Mexican food!",

Our waitress was cheerful and attentive and took very good care of us. I can highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for wonderful food with excellent service.",

The chips and salsa are good though. Last week I decided to try the avocado chicken salad. It was served in a crunchy bowl which was nice. Unfortunately the two tomato slices on top were inedible. They were green and I couldn't even stab them with my fork.  I also tried the fried ice cream. It was made with some cheap vanilla ice cream that would not even melt when left sitting in the dish for 10+minutes.  I really don't understand the appeal of this place!  The rest room is disgusting too!",

I'm very upset the past couple of times my food was inedible and the salsa was spoiled. I have taken back food and was refunded or a credit.... After this last time I won't be returning. The actual restaurant is even getting bad still okay but it's getting there.... The employees in the take out are rude bad attitude and look like they don't care about their jobs. They're leaning over the counters without greeting guests. It's just all bad.... They changed the chips they are so bad they made a bad call on that.... Food is bland like it had been sitting there for a while. I live on 35 th and Glendale by the time I got home the gaucamole was brown so I couldn't eat that... Rice was bland beans were dry... I was very disappointed since I have been coming here since I was a kid and my favorite place and they didn't have horchata.",

    "text": "This is mostly for the current owners.  Read this and you will understand what the two stars (Iv'e experienced better)  This  is hard to write because I used to come here at least twice a month with small to large business groups for years when I worked out of our Phoenix office.  This was a place where the food and the service were consistently above average.    Although they would always be crowded, they were quick to seat our group without reservations at a clean table where the service was equally fast and friendly.  The food was great, chips and salsa a personal favorite and my favorite sizzling fajitas were always as good as the last time,.  It did not mater if our group was 3 or 12 people they were a well tuned operation that delivered great food at a great price.  My other favorites would be their spinach enchiladas, Carne Asada plate, Caldo De Res and guacamole.    What I write now is based from in frequent visits over a couple of years.  WTF happened!!!!  This is not my Garcias that I have taken customers, peers and friends to in the past.  The service, food and atmosphere are very different in a negative way.  Was there a change in management, did the family walk away from the business, is third cousin removed Felix running the place?  The service is slow, inefficient, non-attentive and lacks the welcome that was once present and made this place a staple for Mexican food.  food is now bland, inconsistent and does not have the same freshness that you could count on when I came regularly from 2006-2014.    I do not write this to scare people away because the current Garcia's Management is doing that without any help at all.  I write this because I want things to go back to the way they were and Garcia's to be the place I cannot wait to not only eat, but to share the experience with others, and I know I am not alone in my opinion.   Iv'e experienced better at the old Garcias, and I would give five stars to that one everyday of the week!   By the way, chips and salsa are still good.  Get it together.....",

    "text": "I have been to this Garcias on several occassions, and each time the quality and service gets worse and worse.   In general, they serve \"cheap\", large-portioned, Americanized versions of  Mexican food that are swimming in a pool of oil from the loads of cheese and fryer oil that has been dumped on. If not oil, then everything else is wet from a sauce of some kind from being added on (e.g, enchilada red sauce).  We visited on 9/26/14 at 7 pm with a group of 12 who had made prior reservations. We were seated in the furthest most corner, next to a group of 40, and a second group of more than 20. The noise level was deafening. We were given one glass of water each, two baskets of chips for the tables, and were made to share salsa out of a 2 oz plastic condiment cup for each 2 people.   Twice we had asked to put in a drink order for margaritas and daquaris. The first time the waitress forgot, and the second time, the waitress got the orders mixed up. The bussers were not able to take drink orders because they were under 18 and could not handle alcohol.   After the hour, we had our water glasses refilled for what would be the only time of the evening, and then our orders were taken. Fourty minutes later, the staff dumped the food on the table, then quickly left. The chicken enchilada was served as a beef enchilada, which had a strange texture to it, and the cheese enchilada was served as a chicken enchilada.   Excuse after excuse was made for the slow service. \"It was a slow night so we sent staff home early\", which makes absolutely no sense, unless a group of 40 shows up with no prior notice..and then followed by a group of 20. This restaurant was well aware of their capacity levels and are not able to service all the seats they have inside.  When the checks finally came, we had to wait 20 minutes before they were paid, because no one would pick them up. I had to get up and flag down the manager Gloria, who gave the same lame excuses  - although she made no apologies or attempt to make up for any inconvenience we had. My complaints were quickly shrugged off, and I could feel her uncaring attitude and desire to just have us pay and leave.  These people treat their customers like this because they can -- they serve low-quality food in bulk to people who have no expectation of service. If someone does complain, they can make up for it in quantity with other guests coming in.   I would suggest you save yourself the headache, and go for somewhere more authentic --- like a Filibertos.   This place is just down right horrid. Stay away.",

This Saturday after a movie at the Esplanade, I drove into the Garcias drive-thru to get some early dinner. I always order a green burro, enchilada style with rice and beans.The wait was very reasonable compared to other take-out wait times. I felt like $8.89 was a bit more than what I usually pay, but no real complaint there either.   The food was piping hot and delicious. I wish I would have specified green enchilada sauce but the red sauce was very good. I can tell the reheat is going to HIT later on (excited).   I don't have anything bad to say about this place as it was recommended to me by one of my coworkers. I am from South Phoenix, so my favorites are Carolinas and Ritos, and sometimes Ponchos (on central). I am not familiar with any Westside mexican food so I'm so happy I get to add the OG Garcias to the list.",

I told her just put the containers in the bag I'll do it at home.  Then she had the nerve to yell to the cashier and ask what did I order.

    "text": "So I am moving to D.C. in couple weeks so I had a bucket list of all of these types of food to have out or/and make at home. One of them was to have authentic Mexican food that you cannot get anywhere, particularly D.C. So we did a lot of research because all of the places we used to go to when I was a kid are either out of business or just not good anymore. We saw that this place had great reviews and people have recommended to us that we try this place out.   We came here on a Friday night around 6:40. We only had to wait 10 minutes which is awesome. We decided to get a margarita and couple beers while we waited. The minute we got our drinks, our table was ready. My mom said she wanted a glass for her beer since she had a lime in her bottle, but it took them 10 minutes to get her a glass for the beer. It still did not kill my rating of this place because the meal itself made up for it. Even though there was a long delay like 35 minutes from the kitchen from when we had the most delicious cheese crisp to our dinner. We savored every bite of our meal. The tamales, especially the green corn tamale was outstanding, beef tacos were out of the world, chicken enchilada was hot and steamy, beans were full of flavor and reminded me of my old childhood days.  The only con from this was the service and the bathroom. The bathroom strangely was really messy in terms of toilet paper and paper towels all over so I'd recommend that getting cleaned more often so people dont walk out with things on the bottom of their feet!",

It took 10+ minutes to get drinks that were ordered. One drink too 20+ minutes. It took 30 minutes for our server to run our checks. .They were not busy at all, the place is HUGE and there were maybe 20 tables with at least 7 servers that I saw. The chip buffet was just weird, the salsa was nice and cold, but the chips tasted like vinegar.

When we questioned it we were told that the way you tell the red from the green is you see green specks in the red sauce. HELLO! I was born and raised here and green chili sauce is not red.

    "text": "A lunch companion and I visited Garcias this afternoon for a quick lunch.  As we entered the restaurant  we were greeted and seated immediately. The decor in Garcias is warm and inviting with its Spanish architecture, paint, tiles and Mexican music in the background.   As we were seated our chips, salsa,  and drinks arrived almost immediately.  The chips are served hot with chunky red salsa and a refried bean dip. The chips are hot, very thin, crispy and salted perfectly and the bean dip is delicious.  The menu at Garcias has a good variety of entrees, all reasonably priced for a full service establishment. The staff at Garcias are friendly without being intrusive.  The food is delivered quickly, hot, and plated attractively with generous servings.   My lunch companion and I both had the lunch special, two beef racos, rice, and beans, the typical Mexican fare. We enjoyed a good  lunch at a very reasonable price.",

After I hung up I noticed that a green chili large is only 7.95 on there to go menu. I called back and asked why I was being over charged and they said it was because I ordered a folded quesadilla! On there to go menu it has folded quesadillas which come with beef or chicken for 10.25 plus tax. I said you told me it had to be folded and she said \" sir don't talk to me like that\"! (I am a regular customer there. Ask Norma, Omar, Daniel, and I can go on.) I explained that I am a regular customer and I know a lot of the people that work there, she then ashed if I wanted a large or small. That is the normal green chili quesadillas. 5.95 small and 7.95 large! Check your receipts!",

    "text": "I started going to Garcia's at 35th Ave and Mcdowell Rd with my family back in the late 1950s. This was the original and it was small and it had Formica kitchen tables. We lived near it on the west side. Over the years they expanded locations and then in the 1980s they closed the locations, built Garcia's Las Avenidas and at the same time new Garcia's new more upscale chain appeared but I don't believe there is any direct association. I have heard there is some type of business agreement on name usage but I cannot confirm that. We have lived in East Valley for the past 50 years but make the trek over every few months for an expanded family dinner with our westside relatives. I have only heard compliments and not complaints on the food. Over the years the food and service have been very consistent and good. It seems to be getting more and more popular over the years based on wait times. The old original restaurant was the first place I saw Chimichangas on the menu. Chimichangas seem to be an Arizona original since I did not see them appear in other states until much later. I like the restaurant and was there yesterday and had a good time and dinner as usual.",

We entered at 830 and the restaurant didn't look very busy upon first walking in. I stood there waiting for one of the two hostess' to look up from their cell phones to help me. I asked \"what time do you close?\" One hostess asked the other and she said \"at 9 or 915pm\". I said \"oh but the website said 10 so I wanted to be sure.\" She told me that it's been slow so they were cleaning up. She said \"you can stay if you want it's not like we are going to kick you out.\" Seriously!!!!! No thanks. I don't want to be served overcooked or undercooked food if they are rushing to clean up and leave for the night. I don't know if I'll be returning.",

Just left this restaurant after getting the worst service  I've ever had without eating our food. The waitress was extremely rude she seemed like she was having a bad day. She slammed my child's plate down in front of her. The manager Zach was condescending after  I finally spoke up. He said he didn't have any other servers. Zach actually said to us if we would mind having a beer for him because his night was going so bad he could really use one. I've heard co workers talk about these same experiences there lately now I know why. We will not be back either after 20 years of family celebrations there. What a shame!!!!",

Chips and salsa are always great and plentiful but don't eat too much before your meal arrives.   One of my favorites are the Pollo Fundido which are square shaped deep fried chicken chimichangas with a jalapeno sour cream on top.  The machaca chimichangas wet or dry with guacamole are awesome and prepared to perfection.   During the week day for lunch it is always packed and difficult to find a parking space but they get you in and out quickly.   We just went on a Saturday and found plenty of parking however the service was very slow and they seemed to be under staffed which was surprised and disappointing.   I don't know how many times I have been here and this was the first time the service was this way.  Regardless will certainly be back. Keep in mind this is the original Garcias and not the chain.",

They give you a large bowl of chips, even for just the two of us. There was still some left when we were done.  A lot of other places give these little tiny bowls, with about 15 chips in it to share, which is ridiculous. The waitress was very good. We received our food right away. Even our waitress walked by and said, \"That was fast!\" All of the food was very hot, incredibly delicious, and lots of it. We both really enjoyed the complete experience.",

We ordered a plate for my husband to go since he was working and couldn't join us for dinner. That was when our server decided to end our meal, even though we weren't finished, and offer boxes for our food and deliver our check. Sure, I guess we'll just leave then....

    "text": "I want to dispel a few of the previous reviews statements regarding service. The hostess was friendly and took us to our table right away!  Our waiter was super friendly and even a bit funny! He made a joke about wearing a \"dessert cam\" to see the funny expressions people make when he offers dessert. The portions sizes at Garcia's are LARGE people... so the joke made both my wife and I laugh.  Now on to the food: I'm originally from Kansas and this style of Mexican food reminded me of Midwestern Mexican food. I'm not saying it's bad. Quite to the contrary... I REALLY enjoyed it! But I understand some of the digs this place gets for not being authentic. Honestly, I don't care about all that. There's plenty of traditional authentic Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. This place is a mash-up of Southwest, Midwest, and Mexican that ends up being super saucy, super cheesy, and super delicious. I love the food here.   Spinach Con Queso is a really tasty appetizer. I had the dinner combo #1 with cheese enchilada, red tamale, taco, rice and beans. Did I mention the portion sizes are enormous? They are. The chips and salsa were also tasty. Chips were hot and fresh. Salsa was zippy without being overly spicy.  The food was piping hot and super gooey melty cheesy. The rice was mildly flavored but nicely paired with their beans. On the whole I had no complaints.  The service was fast and friendly. The food was good. The decor was festive and fun. The dining room is enormous and my wife and I were immediately seated on a Friday night at 6:45pm. There was also a couple of guys with guitars going around playing for people. It wasn't overly loud or annoying. I thought the two were passing good guitar players and decent enough singers. It was a fun atmosphere. No complaints there either.  My advice: try this place for yourself. Don't discount Garcia's because of a few bad reviews. I really enjoyed this place and you may come to enjoy it as well. Good luck!",

I have been eating at this Original Garcia's for close to 50 years, since they first opened their doors on 35th Avenue south of McDowell in a tiny restaurant in a tiny strip mall next to a grocery store strip mall. Even when I moved away a few decades ago, I went out of my way to get my Garcia's Las Avenidas fix!! And I did so for over two decades. But the last few years they have just gone downhill... It is kind of similar but just NOT THE SAME!!! In fact, it is not good enough for me to return after my last few disappointing experiences.   I went with my ex-mother in law, one of my best friends, and other family members who have eated the Original Garcia's for decades. First of all, it was 3:00 in the afternoon on a weekday (no one there) and we were seated right next to the kitchen!! Talk about the worst spot in the house with no ambience!! What the hell??? We requested to be moved.   We all agreed that Garcia's has lost its touch. Such a shame!! I used to go to school with the Garcia kids, Jimmy specifically among others, and we used to appreciate the love and pride that made Garcia's the BEST place on Earth!!   Well, fast forward to today and I promise that I won't ever be back!! I used to order EXTRA food for leftovers and this time not only did I not order extra food, I didn't eat what was on my plate and I'm not interested in eating my leftovers. I am so sad to leave with just lifelong memories knowing I will never return...  Garcia's:  Message me if you decide to step it up and make the Original Garcia family proud!! I might give you another try for old time's sake.",

I might come back for a drink only.  We were seated quickly. Especially for a party of 10 Total. Once we were seated it did take about 10 mins for a waiter to become available. I ordered the #6 dinner combo of 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and a coffee. The food took quite some time to come out but it was tasty and was a large serving of food. The price matched the dish which was a plus.  For desert, we brought a cake that the restaurant was nice enough to place in their refrigerator. However, once the cake was brought out we were not provided plates or silverware (since our main course was through we no longer had silverware). We had to get up and ask for plates forks, etc. Overall it's a nice place but the service can really use some work.",

The nachos grande seemed just to be put on a plate no real meat with cheese that was placed on it and stuck under a warmer to melt it. This was not worth the price that we paid.  Then sat for 10 mins waiting for the check and had to hunt down our waiter who was nowhere to be found.  Who finally gave us our check to leave. Yup no wonder we decided not to come to place any more. guess we can go again without it and will make Mexican food at home.",

    "text": "I love Mexican food and love this place! =)   This was my first time visiting the restaurant after discussing where to eat, our fiend finally suggested this one and so we went..It was quite a drive from the east side of town but we were not disappointed. The place looks very inviting that it reminded me of the movie Mask of Zorro and A Walk in the Clouds where they have those mansions with yellow paint with wall murals and nice potteries, it made me smile right away. It just feels homey. Service is fast and good, a basket full of chips and small bowl of salsa were immediately served as you sit down. Our server that night was very helpful, accommodating and very nice. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada dinner which is not your usual enchilada from other places. This one is served with rice and beans and the enchilada is done like a pancake, never had this before but it was sooo good! I ended bringing the rest of it home. The hubbie was craving for a some sort of bean dip so we got a side of the bean sauce they have..And boy! This was more than yummie!! Really delicious!! We finished the whole platter!! heehee Pricing is also very affordable with the big serving you get.  This place is worth the drive! =)",

    "text": "A great place for mexican food. First clue is you actually see mexican people eating there and not just in the kitchen working. We love getting the Jimmy fries as an appetizer, I highly recommend them! I usually order the carne asada taco plate. Super delicious, but you have to ask for limes on the side as they don't come with. They serve them with rice, beans and guacamole. All are awesome but the rice. I'm not a big fan of it, there lies their inconsistency. It's under flavored or not cooked all the way through most times. The service varies depending on the waiter. There's a waiter there who can ruin your dining experience with his rudeness and lack of urgency when you request anything. If you get Miguel what an amazing individual on the ball through your entire exprience. Also, if you ever have a party or function where you must bring food I definitely recommend ordering the Botana Platter. They usually only need about 1 hour to make it. It has small portions of their shredded beef tacos, chimichangas, rolled tacos, a bowl of beans in the middle and a huge bag with chips and salsa. So BOMB! Get the hot salsa and mix it with the regular sooooooo freaking good.  They also have banquet rooms if you have a big group.",

    "text": "This may just be our new favorite Mexican restaurant! Hubby and I were seated immediately, got drinks and chips right away, and settled in to look at the large menu. Hubby immediately saw the Pollo Fundido and when I told him a fellow Yelper had recommended it (thanks, Alexander!) he was done looking. Indeed, he was not steered wrong- it was an absolutely delicious combination of tender and moist chicken mixed with seasonings and topped with cream cheese and melted cheddar. I love carnitas, and so decided to give theirs a try. Holy wow- so well seasoned and savory and yet magically, you could still really taste the pork. Super tender, as well- it must have been cooked for many many hours. The beans that came on both of our molten hot plates were really good. I like it when there is actual texture to refried beans rather than a puree, and these were chunky and flavorful with melted cheese on top. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican rice, but this at least had pieces of vegetable in it and a good flavor.  We got a fried ice cream to share (thanks, Julie!) and it was huge and delicious, topped with strawberries and whipped cream. The service was warm, friendly and attentive- like being taken care of by an aunt. To top it all off, and what tipped my rating from 4 to 5 stars, was the price- $32 for two hearty entrees, beer, sodas, and dessert?!? Easily one of the best values in a quality sit-down restaurant we've had in a long time. Garcia's is going in our regular rotation.",

The food is outstanding, the menu extensive, the atmosphere festive and the service more like eating at a friend's home than a large restaurant. I recommend everything, but have a particular fondness for their tamales. Whenever I am in Phoenix, whether for business or pleasure, it's a sure bet I'll eat at least once at The Original Garcia's. All my friends who live there love it, and friends and family who I've taken there do, too.",

It started off well with a tasty appetizer sampler and flavorful salsa with chips but it quickly went downhill when the entree arrived. The carnitas I ordered were dry, obviously not very fresh. The sauce had a nice unique flavor, very mole-esque but I did not enjoy it due to the shoe leather meat. The corn tortillas that came with the carnitas were borderline brittle, not moist and soft as they should be. The beans and rice were good and my wife raved about the flan. I opted to pass on dessert. The ambiance was very inviting and put together with the standard Mexican restaurant decor. Everything considered, I don't think I will back. There are plenty of Mexican restaurants much closer to me where the food is at least equal to or better than The Original Garcia's.",

An item we ordered was forgotten, the lady gave us the bill RIGHT after she gave us our food which I thought was quite tacky since I want to stuff my face first, then see the bill and pay. The food wasn't very hot and fresh. Decided I was to take my business elsewhere and Arriba Mexican Grill became our new go to place for a long time until they started serving food that was borderline frozen and hiring people who don't care. Well, for my Mom's birthday today she decided she wanted to go to this location. I have to say I was quite pleased with the food and service. I ordered the #2 dinner special which is a beef enchilada, beef taco, a tostada and beans and rice. It was so hot and delicious. Portions were very generous. Our server/waitress Christy was very nice and made sure we were all taken care of. Unlike the Garcia's that is somewhere near Metro Center, this place actually cranks up the air conditioning to ensure comport from the hot weather. I can say we are definable going to come back soon. I was very pleased.",

Last weekend my husband and I decided to try it one more time.   The wait just to get a seat was 30+ minutes. After waiting that long we are bright back to our table.    We notice immediately there are only 4 tables with customers the place looks dead.  (The bar area had more people seated but we had observed people being seated but not waited on there either) Chips and salsa come out in 2 min (but we don't eat them unless we have a soda and no one ever came to take the drink order. . But after 15-20 min of waiting for someone to take our drink order we decide to get up and leave.  Only at that time did someone rush over and try to take our order.   But having seen no food come out of the kitchen while we were waiting... we weren't waiting any longer.  They had one overweight older waiter whom was supposed to be our waiter...but he never came to even greet or introduce himself as our server.      They should just close up if they aren't going to staff the place properly.     Go to Popo's. It's  smaller, better food and much faster.",

Both of us liked our entrees,  the shredded beef tacos were great their rice had a really good flavor and the refried beans were similar to every other Mexican restaurant so that's good. The guacamole dip came out and it looked like it had nothing in it like it was just smashed avocados and I was excited about that because other restaurants put in too much \"filler\". But it turned out to be kind of bland. I should have asked for some lime but I ended up using salt and pepper and some of the table salsa and it was really good so I guess I do like guacamole filler,lol. Overall we really enjoyed our lunch and we would go back there and I feel like out of all the Garcia's we've tried in the valley this was the best one",

Comes back 10 minutes later and got out order.  I ordered the steak quesadilla my husband ordered the beef enchiladas. His enchiladas were so dry. And the rice was hard. My quesadilla as you can see in the picture was sitting in a puddle of grease. I didn't tell the waiter anything cause he was extremely rude and didn't even give us any chance to say a thing. I once was a waitress so it takes a lot for me to complain. I'm not looking for free stuff or discounts. If my staff acted like that and my kitchen sent out food like this I would wanna know as well.

Good size menu- happy all day Sunday?!? What?!?!!!! Yay and mon-fri 3-7pm. I can't remember if it said thru say tbh, so I'll leave that up to you to find out.  Food was good. Service was ok, took a while to bring us happy hour menu. They were on top of the chip refill. Good salsa. Overall nice and cute place. Definitely going back. If you're from LA, it's like El Torito and Los Toros kinda (minus the losstoros dip!)",

The rice is DEFINITELY less than 1 star, the beans are about a 1, but the salsa is pretty good so I'd give it a 4. The baja sauce is also good. It tastes similar to Macayo's baja sauce.  In fact, their entire menu tastes like Macayo's if you're wanting a comparison.",

Haven't really been back in awhile because it was more miss than hit. Anyways Aaliyah was our waitress and she was great, she was friendly and attentive. Our food came fast and hot, I had the pollo ranchero, never had that before it was pretty delicious... up until I pulled a rubber band out of my mouth from the bite I had just taken I was so disappointed. Aaliyah right away offered to remake it which I had declined but she insisted and said we can box it up for you. I said ok hey tomorrow lunch at work, they also sang Happy Birthday to me which was sweet and embarrassing hahahaha. There was a young man I believe a busser I didn't catch his name but he kept checking in on us as well which was nice. Aaliyah had taken my plate and rubber band to her manager when she brought our bill the dish was taken off the total which was cool considering I didn't expect it since they remade my plate. I have to say even though there was a negative to this visit Aaliyah went above and beyond to make it a positive. She was a great waitress!!! Good job also to the busboy I wish I had caught his name but he was a younger guy with a friendly and helpful personality.",

We went to Rita's because it was not a chain. After reading the reviews, we decided to try Garcia's. We decided to sit in the bar area to avoid the wait. As large as the bar area was, I was surprised to find one bartender taking care of everyone. The restaurant is pretty big so I would think that they'd be used to having a full house, considering there aren't many other choices in the area! All we kept  hearing was how busy they were from the employees! I have to say the drinks were pretty stiff (thus the 2 star rating)! I should have known not to order any appetizers because I was afraid they would be served with the entrees. Well I was right! Needless to say I wasn't hungry anymore after two baskets of chips and salsa! I ordered the burro ranchero, expecting pork since it was served with verde sauce. The meat was beef, and it was chewy and tough (damn, two nights in a row)! We also had the mini appetizer platter with taquitos, tacos, and chimis...all beef. My friend doesn't eat beef so that was a waste. The menu didn't specify what kind of \"minis\" they were. He also had spinach enchilada platter with chicken. He compared it to cream of spinach soup. I took a to go box only to end up dumping the food when I got back to my hotel. Another disappointing Mexican food experience in Phoenix! The drinks were bomb! Couldn't even finish my margarita azul!",

The BF and I have been lacking a good regular Mexican joint (as opposed to the gourmet spin of Barrio Cafe) and The Original Garcia's will definitely be in our rotation going forward.  This place offers good food at a good value, which is just the thing during a recession.  The decor is fun without getting into the whole chain restaurant kitsch and this place is HUGE.  It's great for large groups.    The Appetizer Combination is a must.  The miniature items are tasty and oh so cute!  The chimichangas rock.  Oh to luxuriate in that crazy good sauce they use to enrobe the chimis!  The combo beef and chicken fajitas were tasty, too.  The fresh limes were a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty with a refreshingly ample portion.  We'll be back!  Some reviewers talk about his place being in the 'hood.

I took the object out of my mouth and saw what appeared to be a small, sharp, transparent and triangular fragment of glass or plastic.  I showed the object to a friend and our waitress (Carmen).  Carmen asked to take it to show her manager.  I gave it to her and Tony Garcia (President) came back to tell me the object I had discovered in my salad was from the hard end of a lettuce head.  I disagreed and said the object was sharp, transparent and triangular and asked him to bring it back to me.  He disappeared and brought back a small (mushy) bit of lettuce, so small that I could barely see it.  I told him what he was showing me was not what I had found in my salad.  He said it was what Carmen had given to him and that he wouldn't have switched anything up and offered to remove the taco salad charge from the check.   I am writing this review to warn others about food prep issues experienced today at Garcia's.  Please be very CAUTIOUS of foreign objects that may unexpectedly be found in your food.  If you happen to find a foreign object in your Garcia's food order, DO NOT hand it over to anyone.  Request that the manager come to your table to inspect the object to avoid shenanigans!   My hope is that Garcia's did the right thing in the kitchen and inspected and cleaned out their salad container for tonight's dinner crowd.",

The chips were good but the salsa lacked any kick at all but I did like the way they had the salsa in a pitcher and just came around and poured you more when they saw you running low.  The meal was very good and I very rarely eat the rice as I just don't care for it but the rice was very flavorful so that was a nice surprise.  The service though was excellent as they refilled our drinks before we had to ask and were there for the extra napkins I asked for, etc. Often, you order, you get your order and maybe once during your meal you will see your waitress but here, they were very attentive.

Yes more please! This is not to say that the food is bland but rather that I like a little bit of chip with my salsa to give some perspeive.  Amazing Guac, I found an entire quarter of an avacado in mine. Rellenos are to die for, none of the thickly battered over fried ones of the bay area. Nice light egg coating and a little bit of cheese. I love their red sauce on enchiladas too.  So yes, I ate a bite from everyone's plate here and was seriously satisfied.

Mike is one of the most professional, upbeat, positive employees that ever worked there. Recently things changed and the old miserable bartenders were back in place of Mike. I'm sorry but Ofelia is a bitter old miserable person and she is extremely rude and she is slow. Omar has no personality and is boring. Now I've been coming here a long time on a regular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated, the quality of the food is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff. I witnessed two female employees argue and call each other a b*tch in the dining area. The employees openly talk bad about each other in front of customers. I was in the bar once and Ofelia referred to Sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he walked away from the bar area. I've never witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.  The majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional. Your restaurant wouldn't survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there. I stopped by today and I asked to sit on my regular section with Mike, I was told by your hostess that Mike no longer worked there that he was fired. Not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my decision to not come to your establishment again. I turned around and left. I have hosted numerous business functions there and now I will be hosting them at other places. I think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management. A business is only as good as the management hired to run it and I'm sorry to say you suck at it.",

I love the salsas, hot and mild, as well as their chips.  We have ordered the bean dip for appetizer and it was very flavorful.  My favorites here are the green chili (burro or other) and chili relleno.  For lunch, the prices are great and the orders come out very quickly. The only complaint is that sometimes they don't have bussers on staff to refill your drinks so you might be left thirsty.  Other than that, it's a great hangout.",

The decor was just beautiful, and the service was absolutely wonderful. Each attentive employee that I interacted with made me feel like a guest. Things however took a terrible turn when I received my food. I ordered one of my favorites, Red Menudo with flour tortillas. The tortillas were not fresh, they tasted like the thick grocery store shelved tortillas that I try to avoid. The menudo meat was disappointing as well. It had not been cut well, and my bowl had a couple of VERY large chucks of fatty meat.  Sadly, the food did not live up to all that I had heard...",

    "text": "I have fond memories of dining at this restaurant. It is the original Garcia's restaurant that the family started decades ago. For several years, early in my career, this was a staple dining establishment for friends, bosses, co-workers, visitors, etc.  My place of employment wasn't too far from here, and this was one of the few places that served good food at that time.  That was a long time ago, but this visit brought back many memories. I had the pleasure of interacting with our server, who happened to be a  3rd generation family member. Her daughter now works here as well, spanning 4 generations.  The food is still quite decent. My friend and I were catching up on old times, and we decided to order what we considered to be the staples of this establishment.   We ordered hard shell tacos, burritos (enchilada style), and sides of rice. The Salsa they serve is still rich, thick and fresh. The chips, on the other hand, are not so fresh any more. However, our meal was delightfully rich in flavor, just like we both remembered. The rice was a little bit too salty this time around as well.  The service was excellent, as always even with the huge lunch time crowd. I guess they haven't lost their allure with the neighborhood, and it's still the nearby destination for a good sit-down meal.",

However, their website says they are opened until 10:00 PM on Sundays, We arrived their at 8:35 PM. Sign on the door said closed? We walked in and talked to the hostess. She said they are closed. We mentioned their website said 10:00 PM. Her reply was: Their website is wrong, they close at 9:00 PM on Sundays. We then mentioned that is was 8:35 PM, again her reply was: we are a family run business, we can close anytime we want.  Apparently Garcia's no longer welcomes our business. I was pretty shocked of her attitude. Guess it's time to move on. That we did, we ended up going west on McDowell for a bit, was getting ready to jump on the I-10, then I seen a sign, \"Las Cazuelas Mexican & Seafood Restaurant\". I am always up for trying a new place! See my Review for them, it was worth it.",

We were craving a big plate of delicious Mexican food so we had to try this one out.  It did not disappoint!  We both ordered the green burro enchilada style and I had the beef taco which was deep fried and filled with shredded beef and my wife added a ground beef enchilada with red sauce.  Both plates were monsters and filled to the edges with deliciousness!  The chips and salsa were amazing.  Not sure how they do it but the salsa was thick and out of this world.  If you want a Mexican experience that will leave you stuffed like a pinata, try this place!",

Today was a different story. Server didn't write down our order so when the food came out it was made incorrectly and missing things. The manger Zach came out with the food apologizing and fixing the problem. Second issue when asking the server to split our check she wasn't paying attention and messed up the checks*eye roll*  We asked to speak to a manger and Zach fixed the issue once again. He is the most humble person we have met. I will keep coming to this Garcia's knowing he is the manger and actually cares about his job, customers and employees.",

    "text": "Previously, I've Yelped about Garcia's. But this time, I'm talking about the original. It's my understanding that the family started with the 35th Avenue location before expanding across the valley. And most people who know Garcia's, will tell you that this one is the best. I am happy to confirm that! The name adds \"Las Avenidas\" to distinguish itself from the franchised restaurants. But there is a lot more that sets this one apart.  First, this building is huge! On a busy Friday night, the parking lot was packed. Yet me and my friend were seated immediately. A quick scan of the dining room confirmed this was going to be good. The decor, the atmosphere and the character leave no doubt you are in a classic Mexican restaurant. Second, there is a building on the north side of the parking lot which threw me off at first. My friend explained it is used for takeout, tortillas and other to-go items, which explains the drive thru. What a great idea!  Our server Greg was awesome! He was always nearby and had great timing. Plus the others who assisted with chips and drinks were always there when needed. Service is clearly a priority here!  Chips and Salsa are always a good way to make a lasting first impression. The salsa is very flavorful with a nice kick in the end. And it's obviously fresh! Our Cheese Crisp was not as crispy as I would've liked, but that's a minor point. We ate every bite. And where the salsa lacked punch, my entree more than made up for this. I chose the Camarones Ranchero and enjoyed every spicy bite. This is the first entree I've seen in any given restaurant that resembled a \"homemade\" meal. Seriously, check out the photo.  The menu does appear different than the one I know from other locations, but this shouldn't phase you. There are wonderful options throughout and I'm excited to come back and try something different. Muchas gracias!",

The shredded beef, hard shelled tacos are worth the trip alone. From literally anywhere. The wait staff is very polite and usually ready to greet you with a smile and information on the items they serve if you're not familiar with them. (That's for you out of towner's) Try the tacos of course and regardless of your age, it is always appropriate to mix those amazing refried beans with your rice and scoop it up with a tortilla. Is that a lot of carbs? Absolutely. But hey, if you feel like running a marathon the next morning, at least you'll be prepared.",

Ceiling and walls were disgusting dirty, some of the light fixtures did not have coverings on them. There was a girl behind the counter who may have been the shift leader. that was incredibly loud. It appeared that she wanted the couple of customers who were there to hear every bit of her conversation with her co-workers.   I felt like this was a waisted trip as I was completely turned off by the aesthetics. Someone here really needs to revaluate the pricing on the menu. Why is a half pint of rice $3.25? For .25 cents more you can get a full pint. In case the genius's that are running this establishment now can't figure it out you get double the amount 8ounces more for .25 cents. Why even offer the half pint at all? Anyone with half a brain is going to just order the pint. After evaluating the entire menu and the now ridiculously overpriced food to take it to go I decided to take my business elsewhere.   As I was walking out the door without any food the extremely loud boisterous girl said, Bye! Thank you!! Ummm!! Why are you thanking me I didn't buy anything? Was that a thank you for leaving so I can continue gossiping with myThank you for not making me work? I was confused.   This was posted 12 days ago and no response. From anybody on the management team or this Diane P that seems to only respond when the comments are positive. It's no wonder why their are numerous complaints on customer service.",

    "text": "Hmmmm... I wrote a review of this restaurant and now I don't see it, I'm wondering why?  The place is good, old-school Mexican food.  Prices are what you'd expect, they're not giving anything away, it's fine.   But these folks confuse \"old-school\" with a \"don't give a sh*t\", we'll do it MY way!\"   * They say they close at 9 weekdays, 10 Fri Sat: do not believe them. They close whenever they damn well feel like it.   * last week, after spending almost $8 on guacamole, I bit down on the external avocado seed, you know, not the pit, the \"seed\" at the top of the avocado...the one that is removed by ANY COMPETENT COOK?  \"F-it!\" They say. \"We're 'old-school', we can what we want!\"  * some personnel are there to accept your money. Nothing more. Woman bartender is AWFUL. No service, no help, lots of makeup and attitude. I won't subject myself to her again.   This place is SO SPOTTY that I bgo there once a month, at best. If they actually had any professionalism I might go there once a week. You go there at your own risk, and at your own risk stay away from that bartenderess AND any other restaurant in the neighborhood. They're worse: (see: Los Portales!)  03/15//2018- my last time I go to this dump,  I swear.   Again, this joint shows the big difference between \"mom-and-pop\" and just unprofessional. They close when they want and seem to take pleasure in informing you they're closed. See photo attached says they're open until 10pm. They'll be closed by 9:15 minimum.   The bartenders just act unilaterally (and trust me: there isn't a bartender there that could define unilateral.) Female bartenders live to fool with their hair and then fruit garnish the drinks. Ugh.   I keep thinking 1 meal 5 years ago will magically reappear. It hasn't and it won't. Good riddance.",

I was ignored for the 1st 10 minutes I was there, I asked for water with lots of lemon and got 1 lemon. I ordered a burro with the enchilada sauce on the side and got a chimichanga. I did not get a check back by my waitress until she brought my check which she put on my appetizer plate rather than on a check tray like everyone elses. Everyone who was either Mexican of white was given prompt service, checked on and offered desert. I was treated horribly and I am never eating there again. Do not eat at Garcia's on 35th between McDowell and Thomas they are racist and the service is horrible. I literally did not even leave a tip and that hasn't happened in over a decade. -- with Dennis Schulz and 15 others.",

    "text": "I used to come here with my dad all the time. However today our experience was not so pleasant. I do not appreciate your hostess rudely greeting not my father or myself but my knee to your restaurant this evening. Said hostess asked if I had a cut while I walked into your faculty and I replied with I just had surgery. She proceeded to stare at me as if I had twelve faces or was the ghost of Christmas past. We were seated and A woman rudely placed our chips and salsa down and asked if we were leaving.  Our server came and took our orders and was far from friendly. Our food came and the chimi platter I ordered was bland and my father's meal was atrocious looking. The meat was so runny, the rice was overly cooked and the beans were even mushier than the runny so called meat.  After we finished our less than perfect meals the same hostess whipped her head around the bar as if she were an owl to say her goodbyes to my leg. I quickly responded to her with the following statement \" did you get a close enough look or would you like to take a picture?\" She reponded with a \" I was trying to say goodbye.\" She also gave me one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard. I've never felt so belittled by someone who didn't even speak and it would serve your restaurant right to teach your hostess some manners and proper authentic Mexican cooking skills you claim to have. Thanks. Regards. Kathryn Mindlin. I give you a -4 star rating.",

In fact, whenever the boss man comes out to work with me, it's the only place he'll eat at too.  He eats healthy and I do too, well on weekdays.  There are a few options on the menu that won't weigh you down the rest of the day.  Dishes with fish, black beans, chicken breasts, spinach, etc, made with delicious Mexican flavors.  Ofcourse there are the weigh downs as well.  Looove the chimichanga.   It's huge and cozy inside and don't let the area scare you.

    "text": "Despite being founded oh so many moons ago and being one of the older continuously-operating restautants in town, Garcias las Avenidas does little to distinguish itself from the local chain that shares its name.   The food is typical gringo Sonoran style. That in itself isn't a complaint. Sometimes a girl just wants a taco and an enchilada, and the original Garcia's provides that just fine. They also provide good service, though on occasion it's also slow service, particularly after the meal when we'd like to get the check and get out. And most recently they also provide loud, obnoxious kids that crawl over people's tables, throw food, and climb walls. Seriously. I was hoping someone would stop this one kid from using a retaining wall as a balance beam before he fell and hurt himself, but then when nobody did I was almost hoping he'd fall so his oblivious family would leave. I don't expect a business to watch other people's kids but I do expect them to say something when a kid (or an adult for that matter) is disrupting the meals of every other customer in the place. And this sort of circus is happening at Garcia's with greater frequency.   Still, they provide a better Meximerican meal than Macayo's, Manuel's or Arriba, so they stay on my OK list for now.",

There was no excuse for the terrible service and wait times, let alone the bone that I almost broke a tooth on.   The atmosphere is kind of cool, but they could care less about you and it shows. We finally asked to speak with the manager (I have never done that before in my life), and she quasi apologized and informed us that she would discount our bill- When the bill arrived she deducted a whopping $4! That was less than the burrito cost with the chicken bone. This place must be kind of good because of all the positive reviews, but I would NEVER recommend going to this place.",

    "text": "I am a second generation Garcia's Las Avenidas patron, as my folks frequented the little taco stand down the street that started the whole thing. I swear instead of a pacifier, my mom put a Garcia's shredded beef taco in my mouth, and its been love ever since.  This is hands down one of my favorite places to get Mexican food and I love that the family has stuck to their roots even as the neighborhood has changed drastically over the years. The staff is friendly and consistent (in other words - go often - and you get treated like family).  I would offer up suggestions for the best menu items, but truthfully I LOVE IT ALL.  Everything is made fresh on-site so quality has never been a question. One thing I would add to Kristin's review is that if you are looking for a deal, the prices at the Take Out center are about 1$ cheaper per item. The only down side is that you can't order Margaritas to go, so if you want one, drink it down while you are waiting for your order to come up.  Since I live about 10 minutes from the location, I usually hop in my car, hit my speed dial to order, and depending on whether or not there are a lot of cars in the drive thru line, cruise right on in to grab my food and go.    Portions are pretty large, so if you are ordering a two item combo or one of their dinners, plan on leftovers. But where else can you get two meals with chips & salsa for around 10 to 12 bucks??  Oh and did I mention the Fried Ice Cream? Messy as all get out, but OMG is it good!!!",

    "text": "What the shell?! I never reviewed this place?! I have been going to Garcia's ever since I was a kid. My grandmother loved this place back when it was just a small hole in the wall south of mcdowell off of 35th ave... since my grandmother's day - it moved north to new digs a lil north of mcdowell.  Infact, my dad worked on constructing their current digs. So yeah, me and Garcia's go waaay back! haha!! Everytime I enter into their adobe lookin' house into their old world styled living room type waiting area. it's nice and antique but it could use a revamping. It's looked like this since I could remember! I am greeted by a 'round the way girl some Carl Hayden graduate who says hello and leads you into one of their many dining areas.   The large dining area has a raised celings and open spaces and have large murals depicting different places in Mexico and these wooden tables and huge leather chairs. Now I love the chairs... but they eaither need to be tighten their screws or get new ones because their chairs get more and more wobbly with each visit. I'm afraid I'm going to brake one one of these days!   The service is a two prong attack. There's a server/waiter who takes your order and brings you your first round of drinks and then will bring your food and your check... but then there's bus boys who will refill your drinks, salsa and chips and will bring you extra napkins and the smaller things you may need. I personally like this, because sometimes it can be tough getting our servers's attention because they can get pretty busy. Utilizing their bussers means that I never go long without being asked if I need something. YAY!! However, I usually tip a lil extra to cover the busser's share and sometimes if the busser is crazy cool (one of them snuck me a free bag of chips & salsa once!) then I sometimes tip them seperately.   I grew up dining on their tacos and I must admit - I don't really care for them. BOO!  But their rice and flautas are pretty good. but NOTHING tops their salsa & soup. Their salsa is so clean fresh and cool flavor. it's nice and mild but sooo flavorful! I love it! :)   The soup is the showboat of this resturant in my eyes. I feel if you go... you MUST try their caldo! I have yet to try their menudo as I always forget about it whenever I'm there during the weekend. I am in LOVE with their Caldo... it's pretty much veggie beef stew. It's wonderfully not as thick as other stews, huge pieces of potato with zuccinini, corn, green beans, carrots, onion, celery and cabbage. Only rez'd out grandma's make it better! Please give it a try!!  Other dishes I dug there was the Pollo Fundido, miniature sampler and fajitas. I had their carnitas and wasn't that impressed with them. But the Minature sampler is where it's at! I loves it and the white sour creamtype sauce that comes with it. :)   Over all, I'm glad I have this resturant in my family's history. It's actually quite good. It's not too far from my house and it's my mom's favorite place. I just can't dig their tacos and their beans always need salt. Meh. The service is decent but it can be a pain to get parking. The place needs to be redecorated and revamped a lil. It's one of my regular haunts and i always leave happy and full of chips, salsa and caldo!   To my yelpers: if you decide to go... PLEASE try the caldo, it's really the best thing ever! and enjoy your salsa and don't have high expectations of the beans but the rice will be awesome! Oh and don't be afraid to ask the busser for anything!! just be careful to tip a lil extra if you do utilize the bussers' services! :)",

This Garcias is kind of in a ghetto area, so if you drive a BMW like myself, I would do a quick take out and leave the area.  I went in my friend's pickup truck, so we were safe from damage.  Regardless of the location, I felt very warming inside the restaurant.  I feel a very old pueblo atmosphere inside the restaurant.  The waitress explained the slow meat cooking preparation process of some of their dishes, and explanations made my mouth water.  I make a lot of determination of Mexican restaurants by the flavor and spice level of the salsa, and its to die for!  I got chicken enchiladas and my friend got a red chili burro.  To complement my meal, I had a strawberry daquiri-like margarita.  I felt like I was in heaven!",

    "text": "Once upon a time, there lived a happily married couple, young and in love, Julio and Olivia Garcia.  While they were happy and successful, Olivia decided she wanted to go out on a limb and open a restaurant. Julio supported her of course as did other members of the family.  This grew from barely more than a taco stand, to having several large locations around the valley.  They finally grew so large, a member of the family could no longer be at each location ensuring it was being run to their standards, so they sold the business to a franchise chain.  But Julio and Olivia were far from done.  They wanted to go back to what had made them so successful in the beginning, so they created The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas.    The above is a Readers Digest version of the story on-line.  It was important to open with that because this is NOT another Garcia's restaurant.  This is how they started - what made them successful.  And SO much more.    There are 2 buildings.  One large building that houses the restaurant and (my favorite part) an \"Express\" restaurant that makes a limited menu, but all the basics, that are available through DRIVE THOUGH!  Oh yea.  Drive through.  It's amazing!  Or you can park and walk into the small waiting area.  Either way.    But the main restaurant is SO amazing.  It's like you are going to a nice restaurant in Mexico.  Plants, flowers, fountains, tons of saltillo tile, cool art.  And all sorts of fun little nooks to sit.  And did I mention it's less expensive than the chain?  Oh yea.  You're getting Original level Garcia's food, overseen by Garcia's family members in an amazing location, and it will actually cost you less.  It's really amazing.  And did I mention we've always had great service?  Even with a large party  (and some of those people who never know what they want) everything was polite and managed as smoothly as if we'd been a party of 4.  It's such a fun place.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",

We pack up our daughter and ask for a manager, and the manager loads up our plates with quite the lack of empathy after 1-2 bites per plate and continues on to let us know we would be charged for the margaritas.  Lmao......amazing.  Had to take a pic after that nonsense......  Based on some of the other reviews (more recently) on cleanliness - it kinda makes sense.  Proceed with caution.  Very surprised the table next to us (who hadn't had any food yet) knew what just happened and stayed with they're three kids - just crazy.",

    "text": "What once was the best Mexican food in Phoenix, has now dropped to a level of a chain of fast food. I come here monthly on business and have tried to bring my customers and co workers here as often as possible. It truly was good authentic food that had the freshness and flavor that made it a great experience.  I came here on Monday with 3 others and left with a huge void. I deserved it though as the quality here has steadily declined over the past year so I deserved what I got.   The reception was horrible even though we were one of only three people in the lobby.  The hostess had wandered off right when we walked in and had to wait for 5 minutes before we saw anybody.   The Mexican pizza we ordered came out not even close to being hot and lacked any flavor. It was so bad we had them throw the rest away.   When the main courses came out, even though I had brought it to their attention, the food was so cold we couldn't eat it. Not real happy to send food back after one complaint, we had them wrap up the rest and took it home to the good old microwave.   Besides the temperature, the quality was just not there, even the salsa lacked any punch even after i asked for the hotter version.    Too many places to spend my hard earned money to pay that much for the experience we had on Monday.",

    "text": "My Granny chose this place for her birthday dinner. We had a large party, so it wasn't surprising that there was a wait. What was surprising was that two other large parties that came in after us were seated first. We'd already been told they weren't accepting reservations, so it obviously wasn't that. Strike one. When we were finally seated several of the older member of our party stated that it was very warm in our area. My uncle noticed that the fan near our table was moving in the wrong direction, pulling air up instead of pushing it down, and asked for it to be fixed. We were told a management would come over to help. No one ever did, so he fixed it himself. Then we had to deal with a server who didn't really seem all that inclined to actually serve. He had such a condescending attitude, if it were up to me I'd have left after his first sly comment. Out of a table of twelve, none of us got food that was any good. My margarita was obviously a pre-mix, the beans were canned, and the shrimp in my tacos was overcooked. My aunt's chimichanga was soggy and my grandmother's was so crunchy she couldn't eat it, then the server argued with them when they asked for them to be redone. They brought the food out separately, so that some people were nearly done eating while others were just starting. The service was stunningly bad and the food wasn't nearly good enough to make it worth it. It was an overwhelmingly unsatisfactory experience and I wouldn't eat there again if they paid me.",

    "text": "I visited this location as it has been a tradition in my family for years now, our waiter was noticeably new and ONLY was available to take our order and hand us the check. Needless to say the waiter handed me the bill , charged my card for the table across from ours bill. Again, he was no where to be found, I asked the nice \"bus lady\" to speak to the manager. When the manager came out he went to the wrong table and was just as helpful as our waiter. He then found our table, and said he'd void the transaction and charge me for my bill. Ok Great! So I check my bank account to make sure there isn't any crazy stuff going on, which there was! My card was charged for DOUBLE the amount my bill was and not the receipt our crappy waiter brought to us. Zach the manager gave us our meal on the house, told me I should expect a refund in 3-5 days, didn't give me a receipt authenticating the voided transaction but assured me it was done. By this time I was fed up, annoyed and ready to leave. Here I am a week later contacting the DM \"Diana\" who has no knowledge of my transaction because I have no receipt , Zach threw away the voided receipts. I gave Diana the last 4 digits of my card so that she could look it up and give me a call in the next 30mins. No call, I called a day later and asked for an update, when Diana decides that I'm lying and I need to show her a bank statement because there are no transactions with my card number or for the amount I was charged. So I sent her my bank statements about 20 minutes ago, no confirmation it was received. Out of 10 years I have had no issues, mistakes happen I understand. That is why managers are there to assist customers instead of calling them liars and requesting personal information, Zach and Diana - Get your act together!!",

My two most recent outings have caused me to say \"never again\" to this place.   Let's start with the last time I visited.  Being a Sunday I order a bowl of red menudo.  Server says \"sorry, we ran out\"  after another look at the menu I order Pollo fundido which is basically a deep fried chicken burrito topped with jalapeno cream cheese.   The burro was fried beyond recognition and cold!   Just as I was finishing my rice, beans & the few bites I could tolerate of the Pollo fundido a party sits at the table next to mine & the gentleman orders a bowl of red menudo which the server promptly delivered!     Next visit, again on a weekend so I order a bowl of red menudo.   Server says \"I'm sorry ma'am we ran out\"  I relay my experience from my last visit & ask him to check.   He says \"ma'am I already know we're out\" so I order a combination plate of bean tostada and chicken enchilada.  The tostada was good but the enchilada was bland.  To top it off, as I was leaving I saw a server delivering, you got it, a bowl of red menudo to another patron.  Good bye Garcias!",

Although we were greeted and seated right away, once we sat at our table, chips and salsa were delivered.  Our server walks up and asks if we were ready to order; we just sat down. We asked for a couple minutes. Approximately 8 minutes later she comes back abd takes our order. So as we ate, were deciding on dessert when the bill is handed over to us what kind of customer service is that!? I have been a server since I was 16. The server never introduced herself checked on us twice and didn't bother to ask about dessert. She just assumed we were done. I dislike servers like that very much. I think this will be our last time eating here.",

Waited 20 minutes to be even greeted by a waiter, had to grab the support staff to flag someone down. When he finally showed up, he was underwhelming in service. Saw him three times the whole evening, and he left part of the order in the kitchen, we had to flag someone down to get the rest of it. Abondigas soup was lukewarm at best (been eating this here for years.) The food steadily has taken a dive over the past few years. Doesn't live up to the standards I've come to expect from the original restaurant.   Really disappointed. Don't plan to visit again in the future.",

The beans also looked old, did not try them at all. ..Now as a disclaimer, I am Mexican, so the standards are high, but this was an awe full meal!!! I like to take a break  from cooking and go some where where the standards at least are half meet my cooking. This evening the standards where not met even half way!!!  The place was not packed and we where given a table right away, the service was good, the atmosphere was good but he meal was awe full!!! I guess I could not have both!!!

We have had many family celebrations and regular meals here over the years and hope to continue for many more.

And most of the wait staff are friendly and accommodating to our requests.  If you have a problem with the staff or the food just speak with a manager and she will make it right.  The food is good and the portions are generous; the frozen Margaritas are the best I have ever had anywhere.  Just the fact that many other hispanics eat here is proof to me that this is authentic and good Mexican food and lots of other folks eat here too, LOL.  Just stating that they have a diverse clientele.  The restaurant looks a little tired these days but is still acceptable; could use a little 'refreshing'.    The location is a little bit rough but nothing to be worried about during the day; at night you should just be careful.  If you are knowledgeable about the area you know what I mean.",

Salsa - The tomato base comes from a can of tomato sauce, with added pieces of onion. Had one taste and was sickening. You are better off buying a salsa from the grocery store.  In fact, why they don't just do that?  Buy the big jars from Costco.  Most likely cost.  Low quality giving highest returns.   Beans - Again, cheap can of refried beans with no taste and sweet after-taste (awful).  Better to buy a can of beans at the grocery store than this crap.  Hundred times better tasting. Cheese quesadilla - I took a look at that and just couldn't stomach it. Taquitos - just bad.  Guacamole - smoothie-like consistency, likely frozen variety.  Why can't they just buy the fresh guacamole that all the grocery stores sell?  Why do they have to serve this garbage?  The one thing that was OK was the queso fundido with spinach.  Needless to say there were tons of leftovers.  Overall, a terrible place for happy hour.",

We found spots in the bar area with everyone sitting at separate tables.  The host came over and told us that they don't serve food in the bar because they were not staffed to do that today.  We explained that we were all separated and didn't need to be treated as a single party.  They continued to tell us they wouldn't serve us because it wasn't possible.  We looked around and other groups were being served at the bar so we couldn't understand.  They finally decided to move us into their dinning area after half of our party left.  We walked back by the bar to use the restroom and find other people have sat in the bar and are being served in the exact tables that we were sitting in.  Their service is absolutely horrible! Do not come here unless you want to be treated like crap for no reason.  Turning away that many people can't be good for business!",

    "text": "Went with a group of 30 for our office's holiday party. The manager demanded that we have one ticket for the group, When I pointed out that we had reservations and that they had made no effort to seat us together, some were not even in the same room she agreed to allow us to have separate tickets per table but that the tip was going to be added to the bill. The tables were dirty and sticky.   The food arrived before our drinks did. I had to ask for ice in my iced tea, and was told they were low on ice. The food was mediocre. The salsa was plain it tasted like tomatoes without any salt, garlic, onion or cilantro. I am used to a thick flavorful, spicy enchilada sauce, theirs is like red gravy. The green chile was watery with very little meat inside. A co-worker complained about the tostada being stale, and was told that it couldn't be stale. The server then told my co-worker she just wasn't used to good mexican food. There was no offer to correct the order.  When we left, we made sure that the entire bill was paid including an 18% tip. After I left, I got a call from some staff who were stuck because the manager said someone didn't pay. I returned to pay the bill  and when I got there, they found the money in one of the servers pockets. She says she \"forgot\" that she had put it there. When I asked for an apology and what she was going to do about the problems we had encountered she stared at me coldly and told me \"Nothing\".  The only reason I can think that she still has a job is that she is either family or sleeping with the owner.  I wrote the owners 3 letters, called at least 10 times and no one has gotten back to me. Sadly, this place used to be the best of the best, and now it is the absolute worst!",

    "text": "When I was a teenager I worked at Garcia's Metrocenter. As a lowly busboy at the chain restaurant I learned about how restaurants work. The job also offered me up some amazing Mexican food and all the chips and salsa I could eat. In the years I worked there, those never got old.  Back then, the operations were still watched over by the Garcia family, who had sold the name and concept to a large corporation. Today, the chain serves pretty much some of the most mediocre Mexican food around and many of their stores have closed.  However, the Garcia family wasn't dumb; they kept the best for themselves. The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas in Phoenix is still owned and operated by the Garcia family, as it has been for more than 50 years, and is not connected to the chain. Many of the dishes you remember eating as a kid can still be found and enjoyed here.  From the outside, the building has lush landscaping and a separate building for takeout orders. The interior is reminiscent of an old Spanish home with low slung ceilings and lots of woodwork. The main dining room is cavernous, like walking into a Mexican courtyard, bright and inviting.  Once seated, guests are greeted with a bowl of hot tortilla chips and a cruet of mild chunky tomato salsa. It took me right back to my busboy years. If you prefer more spice, ask for hot sauce, which they will provide upon request. I enjoy mixing the two sauces for a tasty hybrid.  To take advantage of the salsas, a Cheese Quesadilla ($5.50) is a must. I always ask for a side of lettuce and chopped tomatoes so I can adorn each crispy slice, then pour on some salsa.  The menu hasn't changed much over the years, which is a good thing. It's nice to know that you can always order your favorite dish, like my all-time Garcia's favorite the Pollo Fundido ($9.95). They take stewed chicken meat, then wrap it in a flour tortilla and fry it until it's light and crunchy. It's topped with smooth jalapeno cream cheese and slices of cheddar cheese then placed under a broiler until the cheeses are melted and bubbly. Served with rice and beans, each creamy bite is sure to please.  The Combination Appetizer ($9.25) offers hearty miniature-sized versions of Mexican classics. This plate includes miniature beef tacos, beef flautas, beef chimichangas, green corn tamale and refried beans. Give this plate a good dousing of salsa and it'll be hard to stop eating. Aside from the mini chimichangas, the cheesy green corn tamale really hits the spot with hints of sweetness.  If you can avoid eating the crunch flour tortilla shell, the Taco Salad ($7) loaded with seasoned ground beef, might be a healthier choice.  Desserts stick to the classics, such as Flan ($4.50) and Sopapillas ($4.25). My favorite is Deep Fried Ice Cream ($4.75), a ball of hard frozen vanilla ice cream covered in honey and cornflakes then quickly fried so the outside is slightly caramelized and crackled.  While I'll probably never go back to busing tables, the idea of all-you-can eat chips and salsa sure makes it tempting.",

    "text": "For the reader, please be aware that there are the \"corporate\" Garcia's which is BLAH!, and then there's this place, The Original Garcia's, which is AWESOME!  I've been coming to this place almost 25 years, and I've tried most of the items on the menu over the years.  I've never had a bad meal, and in fact I use the original Garcia's as my gold standard for other Mexican food.   This place has both the main restaurant, and a separate  take out/drive thru/sit down building.  If you want a more formal setting, go tot he main restaurant, but if you want a quick sit down place, or get the food to go, you have that option.  Personally, I go through the take out most of the time, because its all the same food, which is all the same level of AWESOME!     Go there, and your tummy will thank you for it!",

    "text": "Beautiful authentic Mexican restaurant with decent food, moderate prices and good service.  Chips and Salsa (5/5): Complimentary but most importantly one of the best Salsa I have ever tasted.    Guacamole appetizer (3/5): Decent portion but it's pretty much avocado mashed up. Basically bland taste.  Couldn't taste lime or salt or jalapeno, definitely no tomatoes or cilantro.   Fajita (4/5): sizzling and tasty and a good size portion. What disappointed me was the lack of beef strips. Instead there was just a lot of onions. But I would definitely recommend it since the portion when put together does make a delicious Fajita.   Pollo Fundido (4/5): highly recommended on Yelp. Yet it failed to impress me.  That being said it is a filling dish with a good presentation. I just couldn't really taste the special marinate in the chicken  Service (5/5): Hands down excellent. There were two waitresses attending to my table. Both were extremely nice,  very helpful and checked on at appropriate times  Atmosphere (5/5): Really transforms you into a different world as soon as you walk in. Very spacious, clean, beautifully decorated. Even the fixtures on the walls and ceilings add to the whole Mexican vibe the restaurant is trying to portray.   Conclusion: Even though the food is average,  the atmosphere and service definitely compensates.  A must try.",

    "text": "When I first came to town in 93 the Realtor showing me commercial rentals took me here for lunch.  And I got a bit of a history lesson of Southwest Phoenix.  I got part of the story about Garcia's becoming a chain and being sold and this one location being bought back.  As he used to own a home where Maryvale High School is I also got a history lesson on John F. Long (whom I later met as a customer) and the build up of the Maryvale neighborhood just to the West of here.  I enjoyed that meal.  Since then I have taken business acquaintances, relatives, dates and friends here.  I have yet to have anyone complain.  It's not so spicy as to turn people off.  The thin chips are always served warm.  They used to serve two salsas, now they only serve the mild except on request.  The food is consistent every time.  The only thing I have ever had I wasn't enamored with was the margarita I once had.  The service is always great except it is consistently hard to get the bill.  They can handle several 10-20 party groups at a time.  During dinner hours they quite often have strolling musicians.  This last time I stopped in for lunch and got the chimichunga lunch special for $8.00 which came with rice and beans and chips and salsa.  I was stuffed.  The food came quickly and was just as I expected.  When I got there about 11:15 there were still plenty of parking spaces, by the time I left at 12:00 the parking lot was packed.  I don't hardly ever give 5 stars and I am pretty sure I wouldn't on a one time visit here but how else can you rate a place you are willing to drive from wherever in the Valley for and not be worried about whether anybody with you will like it.",
