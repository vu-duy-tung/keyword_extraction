As a fan of Korean cuisine, the food here is not even close to authentic Korean food (even though the owner is Korean) I ordered a bibimbap and it was served in a plastic bowl with plastic utensils. I could just go to Panda Express (which is nearby) if I want that kind of service.",

There is no Aloha at Paradise. .  The utensils are so cheap that it will not cut anything.  We got the paradise special, kim chee soup, 2 Hawaiian Sun drinks, and 2 spam musubi  and my total was about 28$. The musubi was the best thing I ate there.  After 15 minutes my stomach wasn't happy.  ( you know what I mean)  Would I be back..... NO not worth the drive and hassle..... My search is still ongoing to find taste of home.",

Paradise BBQ is on par to what a local Hawaiian/korean bbq place would be like and better.  I've been traveling to different so called Hawaiian influenced plate lunch places in the area and thus far they are only 'OK'.  I've learned that the ownders of Paradise BBQ actually lived in Hawaii and understand the tastes of the \"Local People\" which already gives them an advantage over the other restaraunts.  If you want to have good food, alot of food and feel sleepy after eating a good meal- as the locals in hawaii call it. \"Kanak Attack\"- than this is the place to go!  OK Pau Now!",

Dingy, not enough seating and way too close together (I had to say \"Excuse me\" 5 times when leaving), they charge for EVERYTHING. That's one of the few things that has always really ground my gears when eating out - being charged 25 cents for ranch or whatnot. This place charges for to-go boxes, more than one drink refill, extra sauce, you name it. They even have a sign on the water that they'll fine you $2 if caught drinking soda out of a water cup. It just gave off a cheapskate air.  My friend had a cheeseburger that just looked blah and she said it was nothing special. I had chicken katsu, which was pretty stringy, the breading just tasted greasy, and there was not nearly enough sauce. The macaroni salad was just bleck - it was warm, eww. So was the cabbage, come to it.... everything from the display case of sides actually.  It was a lot of food for the $10 something with drink, but I barely managed half of it and in a very uncharacteristic gesture, I declined to take it home - must have been pretty bad.",

Lunch combo i tried came with 3 meats but couldn't even tell you what they were or tasted like. You also get 4 small veggie sides, macaroni salad, corn, mixed veggies, etc. the establishment could use a little upkeep, almost no pride in ownership. They have a old buffet as you walk in the door just used for storage of random items. The hot sauce bottles were all down the very last bit. I looked all over the place couldn't find napkins and theirs signs that say they charge for togo boxes and thats never a good sign. But like i said its decent food for the price would definately recommend to try it once especially if you like hawaiian bbq but i certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",

It's paper plates and disposable utensils. If you ask for a water cup, you get a tiny little dixie cup. On the water tap on the soda fountain there's a sign that reads \"ANYONE CAUGHT USING WATER CUPS FOR SODA WILL BE FINED $2:00!\" I have no idea why I find that so funny.  Oh, and they have beer.

    "text": "I was looking for something possibly economical and different for dinner.  This popped up on Urban Spoon...double-checked here on Yelp...and we had a winner.  I stopped in...the lady was helpful in explaining the options on the menu to me (had a hard time understanding her...but after a few tries we were on the same page).  I've never had a \"Hawaiian plate lunch/dinner' whatever before.  I got the 2 meat combo, the Meat Jun and BBQ beef.  The Meat Jun was good...a little plain...but add a dribble of the sweet/spicy sauce the put on the side and it kicks. The BBQ beef was pretty good by itself...a couple drops of the sauce though...brings out some more flavor.   What surprised me the most though was just the sheer amount of food (was not actually looking to eat that hefty).  I heard \"pick up to 4 sides\" and I was shocked.  4?!  OK...picked the macaroni salad, bean sprouts, spicy cucumber, and spicy cabbage.  I got the plate.  On top of the food I knew, there were two large scoops of rice also.  A LOT of food.  ...and most of it was good.  Good:  Meat Jun and the BBQ beef were both good. The bean sprouts and spicy cucumber...surprisingly good.  Definitely interested in a revisit.  The finale...I had a couple scoops of rice to deal with.  The remainder of that tasty sauce mixed in with the rice.  Good stuff.  The Meh:  The macaroni salad...meh.  Tasted like it was drowned in Helmann's...which to me might as well be curdled water...tasteless mayo.  The spicy cabbage was a little too spicy for me.    Conclusion:  Cool little place.  I would definitely like to return sometime.",

    "text": "My search for Hawaiian-style plate lunch is finally over...I've found everything I've been looking for at Paradise.  Sure there are some decent plate lunch restaurants, but nowhere could I find what I missed the most--Korean style food.    Granted, I have only tried one Korean style dish, but it was the best.  Almost like home in Hawaii!  I had the Meat Jun and Mandoo combo plate.  It of course comes with your standard 2 scoops of rice, but I was absolutely giddy when I saw the area with all the Korean veggies.  You can select 4 veggie sides with your plate.  When I went, they had the standard fare of cabbage kimchee, cucumber kim chee, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, chap chae, and others.  Now if they only had shoyu potatoes and daikon, I'd be in heaven.    The meat jun was seasoned perfectly and flavorful.  The egg coating was crisp and it was well coated over the each piece of meat, not falling off like at other places.  It wasn't greasy at all, and the dipping sauce was delicious as well.    The restaurant itself is easy to find right off the ASU campus.  There is metered parking along the street (a quarter gets you only 10 minutes!).  The food is fresh yet comes out quickly.  They also have beer available for purchase, as well as Hawaiian fruit juices.    I am looking forward to trying more of their plate lunches.  The owners and cooks are actually Korean and from Hawaii, so this is as authentic as it gets in Arizona.  I would definitely recommend this place to any homesick Islander who needs a plate lunch fix.   They also offer the full range of plate lunches, from Loco Moco to Katsu to Spam Musubi.    You won't be disappointed with Paradise Hawaiian BBQ.",

    "text": "First of all, I incorrectly thought I was going to the other high rated Hawaiian place because I didn't pay attention to the name or address.  I just knew this place replaced Julio too's (dating myself) and checked it out.    Pretty much everything about my meal was poor.  All of the sides are either really bad impersonations of Korean sides, or corn straight out of the Del Monte can.  The seaweed used white vinegar, the cabbage was bland, and the clear noodle things were just not tasty.    I got a combo plate with BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The short ribs were chewy with very tough fat on them.  They were not that good.  The BBQ chicken was not that good either and resembled slimy dark meat chicken that you find in a Panda Express rice bowl.  I guess the white rice was... white... and made of rice.  At least they didn't screw that part up.  for $10 I expect a much better meal.  I ate about half of it and threw the rest away.  I will never go back, and if you are someone that wants a lot of these flavors, go check out Cho Dang in Chandler.  It seems a lot of Paradise's (horribly ironic name) food is highly influenced by Korean food but poorly done.  You can get a better meal at a sit down place for less money at Cho Dang.     If you want food that rivals Samurai Sam's, Kyoto Bowl, or Panda Express than this is your place.  If you want decent food I suggest looking elsewhere.  I will be checking out the other Hawaiian joint around the corner to see if it is any better.  I am clueless on how this place averages 4 stars.  They deserve 1 star, but I was going to be nice and go with 2.  However, I just remembered that they do not have a public restroom which always chaps my ass.",

I have tried a number of the items on their menu and I have no complaints so far.   This is a Family run business and always better than any corporate places.

It's a bit divey with tacky signs posted around the restaurant warning customers that they will be nickel & dime'ing them for additional commonplace items such as to-go containers, refills, and extra plates.    Which is odd because I actually feel they give you way more food than expected for the price.  I had a combo plate which came with chicken katsu, kal bi, 2 large scoops of rice & 4 small choices of vegetable/pasta/kimchi.  The katsu was crispy & flavorful and went well with their provided sauces.  The kal bi was a good representaion of trademake hawaiian & korean flavors.  Mac salad was also a side i would look forward to getting again.    Along with the plate we also got ourselves a teriyaki chicken bowl.  Good chicken, tasty teriyaki, and some steamed cabbage.  Another good item on their menu.  With those two orders that was way more than enough food for a very good price.

I ordered the dinner special which came with 4 sides (I got the noodles, potatoes, Hawaiian cabbage, and pasta salad) and I got a lot of food for a good price. the only issue I had was that the dinner special took the longest to make, so when I got my food my roommates were nearly done with their meals. I would suggest finding a method to speed up the process of making a dinner special. other than that, it was truly one of the best meals I've had in Tempe. the meat was so fresh and tender, which is True of authentic Hawaiian cuisine. the rice was cooked to perfection and it felt like I was in Hawaii, it was really a great culinary experience. I liked the openness of the restaurant with all the windows. I will definitely be back soon!",

I went out of my way to find this restaurant because I was craving hawaiian food and Ono hawaiian BBQ was not getting it.   First of all, the store is littered with demanding signs about not using water cups for soda and 25 cent to-go containers. Really? I understand that may be an issue in a college area but its just makes the place look unnecessarily ghetto.  Now onto the food.... I ordered the lunch special 4 sides and 3 meats, which seemed generous for the price. I got 2 servings macaroni salad with 2 servings broccoli and then the 3 \"meats\". The macaroni salad is the worst and saltiest I have ever had. The meat was decent but  after eating the macaroni salad I didn't have an appetite to eat anything else.   Overall, this place is very disappointing. I would not recommend wasting your time or money.",

All sides are vegetarian, so all we had to do was allocate more sides per each BBQ dish, and it worked just fine.  Huge portions. I mean HUGE!

The trick is to go a little later...you don't have to feed the parking meters after 6 p.m., and traffic (vehicles and foot) was definitely lighter. Staff was friendly. I ordered the kal bi and spicy chicken, mac salad, and corn. It was so good, I just about finished the whole thing! Kal bi was yummy. Spicy chicken had a nice kick. Mac salad and corn added a nice touch. I washed it all down with a Lilikoi Passion Hawaiian Sun. Great authentic Hawaiian and Korean food. I will definitely be back when I'm in town...and next time I'll try the Meat Jun!",

Just decide, do i like beef, chicken, or fish and then choose (it will save you a ton of time) .. and then you get to the sides, that's up to you.  I personally ALWAYS get the island fried chicken, I'm not even sure if that is what they officially call it here, but they know.  It is chunks of perfectly fried and seasoned chicken that just explodes with flavor once you bite into it. MAKE SURE YOU FIND THE WANDERING BOTTLES OF THE CHILI SAUCE (gochujang)",

The kalbi was good but it was only three little pieces. You can choose up to four sides for your plate. I got sweet potatoes that werent too sweet, mac salad which I liked, um I also got steamed broccoli and I dont remember the last side. Try out this place and try not to mind the mean twins attitude and customer service",

    "text": "We tried a mix plate from Paradise Hawaiian BBQ at this year's Aloha Festival. The BBQ chicken was outstanding! It had incredible flavor and was cooked to perfection, with that magical caramelized crust and just enough char. The kalbi we had was more uneven, with less depth of flavor and a tough, chewy texture. The macaroni salad was fine, if a little heavy on the mayo. Prices were very reasonable.  All in all, I would definitely go back to Paradise for future BBQ outings--I'm still thinking about that chicken!",

In hindsight, I should have asked for 2 sides, double portion. Live and learn.  Anyway, ALL THE SIDES WERE COLD - which may not seem odd, but a) they were all in steam trays (like a hot buffet), and b) it looked like some of them were cooked at some point (sauteed, maybe?). The corn was very obviously from a can, but that's besides the point. Cooked broccoli, cooked zucchini and carrots - all ice cold.  In the end the beef was tasty, though skimpy, and the rice was cooked well. I've never experienced a Hawaiian joint like it. $12 wasted.",

And people complain about the price, well all the Hawaiian food places range from $8-12 a plate anyway. It's the stupid cheapos who give this place a bad rating. Why don't you just go to the dollar menu at a fast food. Don't be a yelp reviewer in these kinds of places if you're broke or not willing to spend an extra few bucks.   Anyway, I've tried everything. Meat Jun is my favorite and for the sides it's the noodles and Mac salad that is a must try. Their Hawaiian drinks are pretty damn good too.   The lady at the front was nice. Spoke up a conversation with me while waiting for my food a few times. Just gotta be friendly and spark up a conversation. Overall I've always had a good experience eating here.",

If you are complaining that they are nickel and diming you maybe its because you're a cheap ass lol seriously 25 cents?  if you ask nicely they might not charge you the 25 cents!  I sit right there and listen to people complain why they limit the mac salad..ever thought that its in such high demand the GREEDY ones who ask for more didn't think about the other people who want to eat it too and you should know mac salads do take some prepping..Oh and yes it's a self service also that means get up and get your own drink don't wave at them and ask them to refill your water.  The twins who own the restaurant are great people, just bc one looks MEAN doesn't mean she is mean..as a fellow Asian I get that a lot..cant help that i look mean when im not its called resting bitch face lol but honestly though both girls are great girls and actually friendly if you actually get over your fear of us Asian lmaoooo...i come often with my son yes i like them a lot they're my son's godaunties now and no i don't get free extra scoops of mac salad bc I know one guy whos so unfortunate he had to cuss at them and leave a sad review over a  mac salad..you can have my scoop dude if youre so butthurt over a scoop lol to finish my review..the food is DELICIOUS i have tried them all only thing is i need more hot sauce people be hogging the hot sauces at their tables at least return it i don't want to walk over to your table",

So my Hun and I excitedly came here with high hopes from reading the reviews and comparing to other places. We drove 35 min to get there. Upon arrival, the place reminded me of plate lunch places in Hawaii... Kinda hole in the wall ish. With Hawaiian stuff decorating the place. This place reminded me of a chain in Hawaii called \"Yummys Korean BBQ\", except not as clean, veggie portions not as big, nor did they have a veggie place option (5 larger portions of veggies and 2 scoops rice). :( Or a fried tofu option like Hawaii often has... :(  I proceeded to the counter excitedly explaining I was newly relocated and from Hawaii and that this was the first \"Hawaiian\" place I found online and was going to try. There was a lady that helped me that was completely rude, unfriendly, and did not care about what I just expressed. :( Just rude and wanting to hurry and take an order from me. With that said, I would never return back to such a rude place where no True aloha is being expressed from them. :( You would think a simple \"hi\" or \"welcome!\" back would have been great, especially because I happily greeted her with a smile and that I was from Hawaii excited to try their food!  But nada. Just rudeness, straight face, and no smile. Bummer. Not coming back. They need a veggie plate option, a website, and nicer servers who don't act like customers are bothering them.   I am one who highly values my interactions with others, especially when it comes to being served, and when a restaurant claims to have anything connected to Hawaii, I would hope to find some True aloha spirit there to keep me coming back for more. What a disappointment. :(",

The cashier is always busy, so it is hard to ask for a cup for water or a pair of chopsticks.  I will say, though, one good thing is that there is restaurant parking out back, very convenient since you'd normally have to pay meter parking to eat around Mill.",

After requesting the forgotten food the woman brought it out and slammed it down on our table.

Oh wait, wait, I seem to remember seeing something about Kalua pork on Wednesdays.  Usually I would feel bad about going to a regional restaurant and ordering something that's not part of that region, but I was hankering for some Korean food and the people operating this restaurant were clearly Korean, so I figured I couldn't go wrong there.   This turned out to be one of the most flavorful and varied meals I had on this trip! I ordered the spicy pork and galbi plate, which came with 4 sides, and since I didn't want rice, the lady offered to give me an additional side. The sides I picked were kimchi, cabbage salad, spicy cucumber, zucchini salad, and bean sprouts. I read the macaroni salad is delicious, but it's not always easy to get enough veggies on the road, so I thought I'd jump at this opportunity. Both the spicy pork and galbi were tender and tasty. The pork wasn't very spicy, but I'm sure you could ask for more hot sauce. I was too lazy. For $10 plus change, this was a fantastic find.   Next time I'll try the Kalua pork, or something else that's more Hawaiian, if I can get past my Korean food craving.",

I am very flexible and adventurous when it comes to dining, and have very few hangups when it comes to food. While I am fully aware that there are many breaded and deep fried items in different Asian and Pacific Island foods that have bones in them, I personally did not expect to bite into a breaded piece of chicken Katsu with a little bone in the end. I almost broke a tooth! I am sure this is normal, but my favorite joint, Ma'i Island grill did not have the bone-in variety, and I just wasn't expecting it.   Moving on, the flavor of every dish I have had here has been lacking. They have a wide variety of sides to choose from, but most of them seem like canned food items that were dumped into a display case. No complex flavors, nothing to write home about.   One of the most disappointing items on the menu is the macaroni salad. It isn't bad, but when I go to eat Hawaiian, this is something I look forward to, and it is plain and bland here.   I have heard the Korean food is good here, but it is pressented as a Hawaiian food place, so...  All in all, there are better choices when looking for Hawaiian dining, just Yelp it out till you find one worth going to.",

For the portions you get when you order, it's a great price.   I like to order the lunch special whenever I go there, but it's only from 11-2pm (?). What you get is barbequed chicken, grilled strips of steak, and meat jun, which is thiny sliced beef battered in egg over rice, and four different sides! The way they barbeque the chicken is tender, and the grill flavour is apparent whenever you take a bite. The same goes for the steak. I'm not sure I really care for the meat jun, because mostly what I taste is egg. The sides are wonderful, I usually order their macaroni salad, marinated cucumber, seaweed salad, and the noodles. I used to order their kimchi, but it's not tart enough for me, so I stopped.   This is a great joint to quickly stop by and grab a lunch, so I don't have any problems regarding the look of the restaurant since I'm there for only around 10 minutes at a time.

This visit was my first to the restaurant and it was primarily for the meat jun, which I have not been able to find anywhere else in the Phoenix area. I was pleasantly surprised with the rice, mac salad, plus 4 sides offered with each plate.  I really liked the food. However, I think they could do more to make the restaurant more attractive. It just seems a bit dingy and I know my wife (a native Arizonan) would probably not want to come back. I think they are relying on good, cheap food and quick service, which would be great if I just wanted take out. They do have a good location with enough tables and parking, so I think dressing up the place a bit more might keep a few more customers, especially on the weekends. We were there on a Saturday evening and were the only ones there (7 of us).  Regarding the refills and to-go boxes, I think they had a sign that said you're limited to one refill and they charge 25 cents for the takeout box. I had added a couple bucks tip on my cc receipt so the gal gave me the box for free. Not a big deal, but be aware. I guess you could just order the food \"to-go\" for the box and eat it there if you wanted to.  Anyway, I'd definitely go back for the meat jun, kim chee, and mac salad. I'm bummed that the L&L closer to me is closed (the one at Stapley/US60), but I'm glad I found this place. I hope that they prosper and invest in making the restaurant itself more attractive to complement the great food.",

So I can only give them 3 stars, at best.  First of all, their meats are not as good as before.  I ordered the bbq beef and bbq pork and kalbi.  Not very much and the quality of the meat was lower than what they used before.  Further, they now grill the raw meat without it being marinated and then brush the marinade on the cooking meat.  Consequently, the meat is not \"well soaked\" and not very tasty.  Their prices are OK, but I never would have thought I would say this, but even Hawaiian BBQ has better prices and better quality meats and more of it.  The only think that Paradise has over Hawaiian is the sides -- Paradise at least has Korean banchan choices while Hawaiian only has sauteed cabbage and veggies.",

    "text": "This was my go-to lunch spot last year when I was working nearby. The food is pretty consistently amazing. I have tried the teriyaki chicken/beef/pork, spicy chicken/beef/pork, and meat jun--they are all delicious. My favorite is probably the spicy chicken but it's really hard to say since they are all so good.  I have not tried other items such as the spam musubi or dumplings but as far as the entree plates go, they come with rice and a choice of 4 sides. It is important to note that the sides are served cold, which throws off some people (such as my parents), but I actually like this because it's refreshing and reminds me of eating at a potluck. For sides I like to choose broccoli, kimchi (my fav), cabbage, mixed steamed veggies, or sweet potato noodles.  The place is run by twin sisters (and I believe more of their family), which is great because things are always in order. I know some people think the owners are a bit too curt when taking your order and whatnot but I don't mind because I know they are actually really nice and if they are being curt it's just because they are really busy.",

I had the garlic shrimp, which were large and precisely the right firmness. They weren't very flavorful, though. The broccoli and zucchini tasted odd. (It may have been proper Hawaiian food, just not pleasing to my taste buds?) The potstickers were tiny, less than half the size I was expecting. They were a bit dry.  The beef and BBQ meals looked dry and overcooked, but I don't know this for sure because they weren't my dishes.  It's an okay choice, if you want something different that's not terribly expensive. (Four meals, an appetizer, delivery fee, tax and tip was only $85.) An order placed at 7:30 on a Saturday evening took about 90 minutes to be delivered. However, I wouldn't order from here again.",

The katsu itself had a nice fry but the chicken was pretty dry. The mandoo (only 4 small pieces) wasn't that great (again good fry though, just flavor wasn't there). They provide 4 sides which I had their Japchae which didn't taste very good (no sesame flavor). Their marinated bean sprouts also didn't taste that great (again missing sesame flavor). Lastly their potatoes actually tasted pretty good, great marinade.   The workers seemed very disinterested in serving, and honestly just didn't seem happy.   I wouldn't recommend really coming back to this place unless you're looking to overpay for not so tasty food.",

I ordered the teriyaki chicken with rice and 4 sides. The pasta salad was pretty good but the rest of it, including the chicken was just okay.

You get teriyaki chicken, beef, kal bi short ribs(not just one strip either) meat jun! and plenty of rice. Combined with 4 sides and it's more food than i could finish.

Its walking distance from the metro link so that's kinda cool, it's a small establishment, with a pretty large menu! The service was ok n it looks like they sell beer on tap also, it's not my go to spot for hawaiian food that's for sure but if ur in the area its worth trying at least once n go from there. N the free water certainly tasted like tap water so we ended up buying small soda cans instead cuz yah the water was not tasty even with ice in it. Parking is kinda tricky also cuz looks like meters n not far from the stadium so good luck.",

Didn't help that it was only accompanied by 1/2 ramekin of Katsu sauce. The Broccoli was cold, and while the Mac salad had good flavor it had waaaay too much mayo. The white steamed rice was good. Will not recommend or eat here again.",

Chicken marinated in a garlicky sweet & spicy sauce char grilled and served over a bed of rice with 4 sides. You get about 5-6 mandoo in a combo dish and while on the smaller side are cooked beautifully. If you don't like chicken all their spicy offerings are pretty good with pork following in a close second to the chicken.  Spam Musubi ($1.95) is excellent as well with a large slice of spam topped over a big hunk of rice encased in dried seaweed.   Place gets packed around lunchtime but the service is quick and to the point.   After you eat here you won't settle for a Hawaiian chain (like Ono) ever again.",

Being a native Hawaiian, lived in Hawaii all my life, and now recently moved to the desert/valley transition has been difficult as anyone that moves from their comfort zone it's difficult in the beginning! You try to find some kind of similarities back home and your friends/family say \"you simply just can't and have to start learning how to eat differently!\" A friend of mines who also says \"Millie, you cannot find the same Korean bbq places anywhere in the states, get over it!\" :-( :-( I refused to give up! Lol.. One day, at home I went on Yelp and I just thought I give it one more try and this time instead of typing in \"Korean bbq\" I typed \"Meat Juhn\" and low and behold - waaaaaahhhhhhh Paradise Hawaiian BBQ Plate Lunch pulls up! I was like no way, no freakin way, in Tempe! Seriously reading some of the reviews from the Hawaii peeps and Ohhh my gosh, We have struck Gold!! Lol...   Now, I just recently learned that Meat Juhn is a Hawaii dish, that's why there are no other Korean BBQ places that serve Meat Juhn! Hawaii is a unique places with many many different authentic flavors and food. I'm learning this as I'm living out of my comfort zone!   The owners are beautiful girls with beautiful hearts! Yes, they are strong spirited because well they've been doing this for a very long time. In fact, they used to own Kim Chee 5 in Kailua, Oahu and also on Ward avenue in Kakaakao when sports authority used to be Gems. How cool is that!!!!   I'm excitedly hauoli (happy) they are here! Sharing their mea ai (food/meals) with all of us near and far. You folks bring to me what I miss the most of home. It's the Flavors in each meat you cook. Not everyone will understand that unless you are from Hawaii.   Of course, I had my meat Juhn plate and it was onolicous, broke da mouth, no can move!!! Lol and the sauce for the Meat Juhn winnahz, winnahz! Some places back home only give you the aloha Shoyu brand with chopped green onions or Kikoman Shoyu (blaaahhhh can't stand Kikoman) but, Ohhh my gosh their meat Juhn sauce... Yummy!   You know you have a loyalty customer that will be by on a frequent bases! I am thrilled, excited, happy Yelp brought me to you folks!   A hui hou malama pono!",

The Lunch Special is a great deal if you're stopping by for lunch and the Paradise Special is basically the same thing but with an extra serving of meat (I forget which one) and is available all day.  Now for a quick rundown of the pros and cons of this place:  Pros: Tastes amazing - I've heard tons of people comment that it's pretty authentic Hawaiian food.  Lots of food - 3 servings of meat for the Lunch Special, 4 servings for the Paradise Special, 2 scoops of rice, and your choice of 4 sides (I always get the macaroni salad, bean sprouts, kimchi, and noodles).  And did I mention, the food tastes amazing?  (Minor, minor) Cons: Closed on Sundays, when I crave it the most.  25 cents for a take-out box and though I don't drink that much soda, it only has one free refill for drinks.  Oh and their spam musubi, wonderful if you love spam and still somehow have room for more food after the sheer amount of food they give you.",

I love this spot because this is the only place in the valley where I can find a quick korean bbq stuff.  The other Hawaiin spots are good too but don't serve Meat Jun or all cool Korean side dishes.  My favorite dishes are the meat jun and kalbi.  The kalbi has great flavor but its a hit or miss on the portions.  Some times I get surprised and there is more than usual but sometimes I get pissed and wonder if I should come back for Kalbi here again.  The Meat Jun is always a huge portion.  Probably cause the meat doesn't cost as much as kalbi meat.  It's a great alternative for people looking for good Korean BBQ.  Most korean restaurants are way more expensive than here and more sit in restaurants.  I always order out at this place but I did notice the nickel and diming they do with all the small stuff like refills and stuff.  I hate when places do that too but its a rough economy and the owner have always been super cool with me so that stuff doesn't bother me I guess since the food is good.",

I am still buzzing off of my happy taste bud high after eating a scrumptious plate of spicy bbq pork, three sides of kimchee, macaroni salad, and perfectly sticky rice.  I love a good Hawaiian plate lunch with the traditional rice, meat, and macaroni salad, but learning that this place makes Korean fare as well just sent me over the edge.  Back in the 'good ol' days', when Korean Garden was open and run by its original owners (late 1990's), I had piece of mind in knowing that I could always go there to satisfy my cravings for Korean food.  The only downside -  it was a bit pricey, especially for a frugal college student... Paradise Hawaiian BBQ would have been a dream for me back then, as the prices are great and you get a ton of food for you money.   So, if you want a tasty, satisfying meal, you should definitely give this place a shot.",

    "text": "It's the Korean touches that make this place great, great, great if you've ever lived in Hawaii -- and even if you haven't. The kim chee, meat jun, short ribs, sprouts, etc., are out of this world. Order the lunch special -- meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken -- for a treat. The spartan, somewhat cramped atmosphere isn't going to win any awards, but that's part of the charm, as is the friendly service. The portions are big enough for two. I split a plate with my young son and still have leftovers to take home. For light rail riders, it's a block south of Tempe Transit Center, so you can get there easily without dealing with campus-area parking. Check this place out and make sure it stays open. I can't live without it.",

The macaroni salad is da bomb!! when i go to the restaurant i get two scoops of that.  I usually order bbq chicken and short ribs or the lunch special. nicely flavored and tasty. I just  love it. i look forward to going to paradise hawaiian bbq when i go to school.  i give them 10 stars!",

    "text": "Wowlaulau! I'm so glad that I decided to search meat jun in the YELP app because it brought me to this great restaurant that reminded me of back home food, Hawaii. This place is located in downtown PHX so parking sucks and a lot of it is paid meter parking but that didn't bother me since I was on a mission for meat jun. Once I got into the restaurant the two ladies running the cash register greeted me and my co-workers and we ordered. I decided to get a 2 choice plate which consisted of meat jun and kalbi. Kalbi is essentially marinated short rib and meat jun is an egg batter around some tender beef. Now lets get to the food...   Meat Jun: This bad boy was cooked to perfection, the beef was tender and the batter wasn't heavy and just right. The sauce that comes with the meat jun was on point and the way it needed to be. I'm telling you people if you haven't tried meat jun, you need to.   Kalbi: The kalbi didn't disappoint either and the marinated on the short rib was amazing!   This place will be my go to for Hawaiian food in PHX when I return so be sure to check them out. The portions are huge so come hungry!",

Oh and I had to download an app just to pay for parking. Can you tell I'm not a city girl?! Lol! Anyway, on to the actual restaurant. It's a lot smaller than their previous location but it's nice. They have some seating outside as well. The menu is a lot smaller than it used to be and they no longer have all the sides. It's only Mac salad and toss salad. The food was good but with all the changes it's not worth my 45min drive.",

It comes with a choice of 4 sides (macaroni salad, bean sprouts, potatoes, kimchi, corn, zucchini, and some others that I have no clue what they're called...sorry!)   Their chicken katsu is also delicious, but my MVP (most valuable plate) is the chicken and teriyaki beef. The succulent BBQ flavor of the chicken is just divine. I have to admit that the beef is not as flavorful as the chicken, but it's still one of the best teriyaki flavored beef my palate has ever had the pleasure of sampling!   If you haven't tried this place yet, don't miss out on this gem! Just one bite and you'll be begging for more! I'm drooling for more as I'm writing this review!!",

    "text": "Located right down College Avenue by ASU's Tempe campus...I was honestly surprised at how much variety they have on their menu! You can get typical Hawaiian BBQ dishes like Galbi, Spam Musubi, Loco Moco, and Chicken Katsu, but they also have other items like mandu (dumplings), bibimbap, burgers/sandwiches and Korean soups (kimchi, tofu, ddeok).   Since I went during lunch I decided to try the lunch special, which was way bigger than I expected and had meat jun (thin beef dipped in egg batter then fried), teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki beef on white rice. It also came with 4 sides (that you get to choose!!!), and I had two scoops of kimchi, vegetables (zucchini and carrot I believe), and a scoop of the mac salad. Overall the food wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. I most likely wouldn't come out of my way to come back here, but it was convenient since I was on campus.   The girl at the cash register was nice and friendly, but everyone else in the back was definitely not. They were yelling at each other and were faaar from approachable, so that was kind of awkward. Also, the mac salad has a lot of mayo. Like a lot. So beware.",

Throughout the entire ordering process the young lady taking the order was extremely rude. Fast forward to pick up and two plates + the 3 musubis were not in our order. Same young girl who took my order kept telling me that everything was in the bag. Luckily, another lady helped and actually looked at the order and counted the amount of items on the ticket. Sure enough, 2 plates and the musubi were missing. Cue the huffing, puffing, rolling of the eyes, and more attitude. I understand it's opening day and we had a large order. However, customer service shouldn't be thrown out of the window.   FOOD Spam musubi was small and the rice was a little harder than I would have liked. Plates had a good amounts of protein with rice on the bottom and small scoops of mac & a salad. I felt the price was decent enough, about $11. Would I try it again?

    "text": "I've been mourning the loss of Mai Island Grill since it closed. Desperate for a nearby Chinese fix, my coworker and I swung down to brave Paradise Lost Hawaiian BBQ, as I'm wont to call it.  It's incredibly hot inside. The dining area is air conditioned, but the lobby/foyer where you order, not so much. The food is just barely passable. It lacks the rich flavor that I'd come to associate with good Hawaiian from Mai, and I suppose there's a decent amount of it, but it feels just slopped into a take-out container and there you go. The rice is a too-sticky mess (not in the good way), and the broccoli and macaroni salad were disappointing.  I had the lunch special and the chicken just wasn't doing it for me. My coworker was excited by a big noodle soup bowl an older Korean gentleman was slurping in the dining area, but he was brusquely informed \"we no serve soup\". So much for that.  The cook was just behind the counter, literally sweating onto the grill, dropping his grill-cleaner on the floor, and having at it again without much of any concern. Now, I know I leave my grill scraper outside and I'm sure I've dropped it, but this is just one of those things that piled on the disappointment. The food was lackluster, but you get a lot of it, and it's relatively cheap.   I won't be back. I'll resign myself to hoping the Mai people come back as they've hinted at on their Facebook and Twitter.",

    "text": "So after discovering that Mai Island Grill closed the boyfriend and I tried to be optimistic and try \"the other place down the street\" - Paradise.  Boooo. It completely pales in comparison. I got the lunch special which included BBQ chicken, BBQ beef and Meat Jun. The chicken was meh, the beef was hard to chew, but the Meet Jun was pretty good. Hence the two stars instead of one.  You do get a lot of food. The meat comes with two scoops of rice and your choice of sides. I chose the mac salad (given) and veggies. The mac salad was okay, very creamy. But my veggies were cold. Like intentionally cold, not just that they had cooled off. I thought this was weird. Cold corn? Chilled cooked zucchini? No thanks.  Boyfriend had the katsu. It was decent but not outstanding. Overall it seemed like they use pretty low grade meat. As he put it - \"lots of knuckles.\" Yuck.  I might go back to try the pork or the spam musubi - at least you know what to expect from spam - but I won't be running back anytime soon. Maybe once my stomach ache goes away I'll feel better about the place.",

We found it right here in Tempe AZ. Paradise Hawaiian BBQ is the bomb! Korean/Hawaiian BBQ meat with 2 scoop rice and 4 sides complete your plate. The mac salad is ONO!   The restaurant is family owned (by a local Korean ohana) and the service is great. Eh, they carry Hawaiian Sun Juice and make a mean SPAM Musubi too.   If you are missing some good Island food this is the best place we have found to get our fix!",

Don't expect any cheerful \"Hello, how can I help you?\" and don't expect any eagerness to give you extras, like extra napkins, without a dirty look and exasperated expression on the cashier's face.  Despite the service, it's worth it for the great selection of dishes and sides.  The meat jun was very good, and is somewhat like the Asian version of a chicken fried steak.  It's an egg battered steak that's been fried.  The steak meat was tender, and the meal came with steamed rice and your choice of panchan sides as well as macaroni salad to choose from (4 for each meal).  They had panchan such as fried cabbage, bean sprouts, kimchee, jap chae, marinated seaweed, and broccoli florets.  They also have Hawaiian Sun drinks as well as a soda fountain for your beverage needs.  This is a place I'll be frequenting again for the delicious plates.",

We walked in with no one at the register and then the lady came back from the back with refills for their sides. She had gone back and forth 2 times to get her refills so we had to wait for a good 4 minutes to be acknowledged. I asked if she could let us order first cuz we have somewhere to be; she said she will need to finish what she was doing. So she went back two more times to refill the bean sprouts and then she was finally ready for us. So no, I didn't  feel welcomed there but I guess that's not what they are striving for. They are in a good location with tons of college students would frequent their place so they are not concerned about a few unhappy customers. But if you care about your service experience and not from this general area, I would definitely NOT recommend this place. It's not worth the drive and there are other better Hawaiian food places in the valley!",

As my sides I chose to gamble by taking all 4 as \"macaroni salad,\" it should just be called mayonnaise, but hey, it's a free country. The place is kind of hole in the wall, which I don't mind, so long as the food and the service is good. The chicken was great, which is why I gave the place 3 stars but the service was horrible, the woman behind the counter was rude, and the macaroni salad was mayonnaise with a few cold pieces of macaroni, topped with more mayonnaise.

The lady who was cashier and cook was expressionless, as if she didn't care if I was a customer or not and after I sat down, she called me up again to pick four sides (when she could have done so right there). When I asked her if I could have napkins and chopsticks she angrily pointed at the area where they were. As I walked out, I saw them hauling on a dolly, FROZEN hamburgers, fries, and other items from a mail truck. The second time I was a customer there, a more friendly, younger girl took my order and was actually happy that I was a customer. Though, the same lady from my first visit was preparing my loco moco to go, and she took a long time because a customer who she was more familiar and friendly with happened to be there and she stopped to have a chat with him while my loco moco was getting cold. My last and lesser pet peeve is the pricing of the food. I feel like I've been cheated. How I miss Mai Island! They prepared all of their food fresh, it tasted delicious, and Jay provided one of the best customer services I've ever experienced!",

And no wonder my chicken was so over cooked it took over 15 minutes to make and it wasn't even busy. So disappointed. They offer four sides besides rice, and long rice is one of them which is awesome.  Too bad they were all cold. They put my sides in the box right in front of me when I ordered and let it sit there while my katsu was being cooked a lot crispier than should be. The chicken was rough, border line jerky status. I figured I'd give the place a chance based on all the good reviews. You people are nuts, of this is the best Hawaiian local food you can find there's a problem. I'm sick of all these fake \"Hawaiian\" restaurants. They're all just weak Korean bbq's ran by people who don't know anything about adding that aloha to a plate. I don't like giving such bad reviews but I'm sincerely upset about wasting $10 on a very poor plate lunch that had me in there 20 minutes. The cashier didn't have any enthusiasm. The whole vibe was just sad. No aloha! I'll just stick to golden Hawaiian BBQ off southern and dobson. At least when I wait forever there, the food is good. And not overpriced.",

I do like Korean food, but in this case, I didn't think it worked out too well. The prices are normal - about $8/plate - and you get a main entree with 4 sides. For the sides, you get to pick from a selection of various Korean side dishes, like kimchi and pickled cucumbers. They also have macaroni salad, which is more of a Hawaiian BBQ side dish.   Today I ordered the Beef BBQ plate and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Katsu and Meat-Jun plate. I thought the beef was cooked well enough. It wasn't so tough that I couldn't cut through it. But I thought it was a little too salty and dry after a while. The meat-jun was really good. I'm not sure what it is. It seems like it was meat wrapped in egg or something...? The chicken katsu was also all right, but the katsu sauce was too thick and too salty as well.   About half way through the meal, I started feeling a little uneasy. I'm not sure what it was - maybe it was the macaroni salad or the kimchi. My boyfriend felt the same way, too. It wasn't too bad that I couldn't finish my food, but I didn't really enjoy it and I don't think I'll be coming back.",

Back to the meal though: I came for dinner and the sides that I chose were steamed broccoli, a cabbage vegetable dish, glass noodles and macaroni salad of course! All very scrumptious and totally filling. I was halfway thru my to go box and pretty much had to stop because I was so full. Another plus- it's within walking distance of the lightrail, so even if you are not near ASU or Tempe, it's a good place to check out.

    "text": "Ok, so I have never been to Hawaii or had Korean food in Hawaii, so my experience is solely from enjoying the flavors and spices of the food.  However, living in Korea for almost two years has compelled my taste buds to know when Korean food is amazing, mediocre, and just plain bad.  The food here is actually rather tasty, and somewhat authentic.  It is not as yummy as Korean food that I have enjoyed in New York, California, and Korea but it calmed my craving for inexpensive Korean food.  I ordered the combination of the fried chicken patty and grilled spicy barbecue chicken.  My sides included kimchi (which was decent), seaweed salad (yummy), macaroni salad (a little too much mayo, but surprisingly tasty), and cabbage (which got lost in the sauce of the kimchi and spicy barbecue chicken).  The white rice was nice and sticky like I like it when eating Korean food.  The young lady at the cash register was nice enough.  She and I talked about Korea and how things had become expensive there since I last lived there almost 4 years ago.  Overall I received a lot of good food for less than $10.00.  I will be back and maybe have a beer next time with my meal.",

    "text": "This place definitely filled my korean bbq hunger. I got the bbq chicken and kal-bi combo which was probably the best combo in my mind. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The kal-bi had a nice flavor, although I would have liked more or it in proportion to the chicken. We added a bud light for a dollar, which is a plus in my book.   I enjoyed the sides, the macaroni salad, noodles, kimchi, and broccoli. Although the kimchi is not as pickled as I normally like it, it still had a good flavor.   Sure this place charges you extra for things like takeout containers, but is it really a problem to just order it as a takeout and then eat what you want there and then take the rest home?   My complaint is that it was hard to eat the food with plastic forks and knives.",

There is some hot and cold bar that is stuffed with garbage; it looks like it used to be salsa bar of some sort. The interior is very poor and gives you the feel it hasn't been redecorated in thirty years.  Kalbi was okay, since I like Kalbi, but the amount of meat - five or six tiny pieces! -wasn't worth 10 dollars. As another reviewer mentioned, it is much better to cook your own. It was nice that they give 4 side dishes, but I personally don't like cold side dishes and the flavor of them weren't that great.  Probably, it was accidental, but little fly came to our table and got stuck in my japchae - not to increase my appetite.   The staff wasn't very friendly. All in all, definitely, not a paradise.",

    "text": "Maybe when they opened in 2009, they had better service but this place is pretty close to horrible.  I am pretty easy going, and would come back to most places but this place is a one time thing.  Too many complains that are similar to others who have 1 or 2 stars.  Read theirs, its very similar to my experience there.  The 2 stars is purely for the decent quality of their meats and sides (except the macaroni salad which taste of pure mayo).  No stars for layout/appearance/settings, no star for unfriendly and rude customer service.  No stars for being cheapskates and posting signs asking for 25 cents for to go boxes, one refill each or they will charge u if they catch U.  Use the water cups for soda and they will \"catch you and charge U the full price\", and oh also no Restrooms.  Not even for customers.  I wonder who they bribed at the City of Tempe to get away with this.    My own experience goes like this, stood at the counter after looking thru the menu at the side.  Was the only one there except for another customer who is sitting and talking with the cashier.  Cashier reluctantly comes over and take my order.  Told me to pick 4 sides, half way thru scooping my mac salad, turns away and disappears to the back.  Comes back and ignored me, went to the microwave and pulled out a plate of food.  Grab chopsticks and a napkin and brought it out for the customer she was busy chatting with (probably a regular)  Realized that I am still here (its hard to miss a 6-1 fella standing behind your damn counter)  and came back to get me the rest of my sides.  What is wrong with that previous paragraph................Microwave.  other than bad service which I have already expected, i guess they have meat and stuff ready grilled and just popped them with the sides all on a plate into the microwave.    The Kalbi ribs were decent, some sections had too much fat, use a better grade of meat to prevent this.  chicken terriyaki is good.  Meat Jun is disgusting.  Sorry whoever had it, might have had the fresh ones, mine is stale cold and microwaved, I know it because anything with egg when left for too long will start to leech oil and turn a darkish yellow color.  They have a lot of food, yes, but their formula for success is just that, lot of food, lot of mediocre, cafeteria, mess hall type of food.  if you are hungry and need a lot of food and have no problems handling this, well, its all good, this is your place to come to.  I would have loved this place when i was in college, but wait, I had mai island Grill back when I was in ASU and they made really good BBQ for about the same price.  Don't be impressed by the sides because all Korean places in the valley give U these sides of 6-8 dishes with your lunch or dinner.  Their sides are nothing special and same as any Korean place.  if that is all someone need to beat them, then just make medicore food like they do, don't use a microwave or better yet just hide it from the front, give 5 sides with every order, charge the same price, give free refills, free to go shit and last but not least, service with a smile.  Open your restaurant down the road from this place and yup, maybe even call yourself the Real Paradise Grill :)  I think some of the people I usually see with great reviews on Yelp had probably came here in 2009 when it first opened but now, its lost its sense of pride in terms of appearance and food.  Its time for either an owner change or a restaurant change.  Last but not least, Sun Devils, come on, you need to pick with you feet and walk away from places that gives you bad food and service, I did, you can too.  get a george foreman grill, some korean bbq sauce, some beef short ribs, put them in a bag, pour in some bbq sauce and let it sit over night, next day just grill it.  Thats it, all the kalbi u like to eat.",

I'm not really into expensive places for lunch, and my threshold is about $7-8. Almost everything here was $9+ for lunch, except their special \"Blazin Steak\". It came with a drink, some pretty good steak, a side of some balls of rice and a side of macaroni. While the steak was pretty tasty, the macaroni was really plain and the rice was just plain boring. Even with additional \"teriyaki\" sauce I was bored.  To make things worse, they couldn't remember whose order was whose. It took about 5 minutes to figure out everything when they started bringing out food. A girl at our table got food she didn't even order, and then had to wait 10 minutes to get the right order. This place is clean, the service is debatable, but for me the food is kind of bland. Don't think I will be trying this place again.",

If you're looking for a high class lunch place then go to Smashburger, Pita pit, or the restaurants on Mill Ave. As far as this restaurant goes, it gives off a feel of what an actual plate lunch restaurant/stand is.  If you order a hamburger here or any other item that's not of what's typically eaten in Hawaii, then you pretty much set yourself up for that. Again, people you need to realize that the economy sucks...so of course their gonna charge for small stuff.  All in all this restaurant deserves more than 5 stars. The food is similar to what is in Hawaii. If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian food, then go Hawaii. This place has majority of the staples we have in Hawaii.  This goes with saying people if you're expecting something more high class which all of  you are, then go to mill ave. You obviously aren't open minded and seem to think that Hawaii only has Hawaiian food. Get your facts straight people!!!",

    "text": "As a local boy from Hawaii I made it a quest to find a place that reminds me of home and after living in Phoenix 4 yrs now.....I finally found a place that can subdue my craving for a for Korean style plate lunch. Plate lunch is a term that us locals like to call our plates from a bbq or local eatery. A normal plate that you can get from ONO Hawaiian BBQ, L&L BBQ, or any other hawaiian places is that every entree comes with rice and mac salad. But Korean style plate lunches come with rice and 4 sides like mac salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, noodles, corn, salad, and seaweed plus a few other choices. Thas the key difference and so far this is the only place I have found this.  I like this place the most compared to any other Hawaiian bbq spot out here is that they serve Meat jun and the sides.  Meat Jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is egg battered, then pan fried, and served with a slightly spicy sauce. It is also a Korean entree that originated from Hawaii so don't really expect to find this at any other Korean restaurants.  I recommend people to try this place.",

I highly recommend it to start off with.  The kalbi was moist and cooked to perfection, but I'd skip the teriyaki chicken. I personally didn't really care for it. As for the 4 sides, I wish they would have warmed up the steamed veggies. It was cold and just didn't taste right. The macaroni salad was on point though I do suggest getting that as one of the sides.  We also ordered a drink and it was a disappointment that you can only refill your cup ONCE! Not worth it if you're paying $1.85 for the cup. I'd stick to the FREE cup of water with unlimited refills.   I'm really big on customer service and they are NOT friendly at all.

All the popular foods are on the menu, and don't worry, there are pictures up of all the dishes. I ordered one of my favorite dishes is Kahlua Pork, and they had it. I had it with the popular Hawaiian side dish, macaroni salad and then added a side of Korean Kim chee. The food is great and a break from all the normal college row food fare. Give it a try!",

Most everything on the menu is about $9-$10 with a few exceptions but it's just really bland. I LOVE Hawaiian food and this place isn't really True Hawaiian either, it's like, some Hawaiian, some Korean and some other strange stuff. I guess if their prices were $5 for everything and I lived real close or went to ASU I'd probably stop by every now and then, otherwise it's just not worth it.",

The kalbi is great here, and my personal favorite sides are the japchae, kimchee and mac salad. It's a really good substitute for when you're missing that good old island food! Also close to campus, which is a huge upside. Good-sized seating area inside, and outdoor seating offered as well.",

The first time coming here, I was a little worried because it was a little on the pricer side, but as soon as I get my food, I was satisfied by the portion side and the amount of sides I was allowed. The bbq meat was really good and was worth it.",

    "text": "I didn't love it.  The food was just ok.  The multitude of \"NO\" signs didn't impart a vibe of friendliness (see pictures).  That said, the staff were nothing but friendly and kind, but the signage implied that their manager or owner did not share their attitude. The bathroom key situation strikes me as extremely unsanitary.  Food: The chicken was fine.  The sprouts were intolerably salty.  The menu offers brown rice, but I was told it was not available...ever.  Rarely do they receive a request for it, they said.   The signs:  Front door - \"No public bathroom\" Over the soda fountain - \"Limit one free refill for each drink purchased\" Multiple locations - \"Due to high demand in macaroni salad, we are now limiting up to two scoops of macaroni salad on each plate\"  Uh, ok? Multiple locations - \"No outside food or drink allowed\" Multiple locations - \"Extra plate or to-go box: $ 0.25\"  Seemed like a lot of rules to me.  The bathroom:  I asked to use the bathroom and was given a key attached to a large wooden spoon and directed outside and around the corner.  These situations always repulse me.  There was really nowhere to set the spoon in the bathroom.  I reluctantly held it squeezed between my upper arm and my ribs while I used the bathroom.  Then, after washing my hands, the spoon still under my arm, I transferred the spoon back to my hand and tried not to think about those who had done the same...without washing their hands.  Using a paper towel to open the door seemed ridiculous as this point: I was carrying an item people hold *while they pee*, not just transiently touching an item others touch *after* they pee.  Then it got worse. I returned to the restaurant where I handed the wooden spoon / key back to the woman behind the counter, whom hung it back in the kitchen where they keep it and then continued to prepare food, including presumably mine (yikes!), while I returned to my seat where my diaper bag was waiting. I quickly retrieved and used the hand sanitizer from the diaper bag for both myself and and my child.  Overall, I found I left without a positive sentiment.  As such, I will not be returning.",
