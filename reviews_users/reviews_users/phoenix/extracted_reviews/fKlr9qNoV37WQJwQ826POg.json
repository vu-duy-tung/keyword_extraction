    "text": "After a wonderful experience with this chain in San Antonio, my husband and I decided this would be the place to host my in-laws 50th Anniversary family celebration. The ease of making the reservations online lead me to believe that the evening would be a smooth and enjoyable.   Unfortunately that evening my husband was held up at work and we were about an half an hour later than our reservation. The host at the restaurant did a wonderful job seating our party and starting the meal as we had texted the family explaining our situation. Even upon our arrival, the servers were very helpful in getting my husband and me seated. As the meats were circulated to our table my husband and I had to continually catch the servers attention. Being a slightly larger party of eight, I did not think that was a number that would allow members to be overlooked. After about 45 minutes it seems the font of house manager noticed our issue and was very helpful sending servers to us and even asking if we were waiting for something particular.  But due to our later arrival as the rest of our party were enjoying conversation and the market bar, the meat stopped arriving along with all servers. They all seemed to have migrated to a different portion of the restaurant.   The other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked. As our reservation was at 6pm, I can't imagine this was because the meat had cooked too long during service. It was a Thursday evening with I'm sure slower traffic than a weekend, but I would have thought the kitchen would be aware of how many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly. Sadly to say that does not seem to be the case as chicken, pork, and even sausage were all dry and over cooked.   The bottom line is that I left an all you can eat restaurant hungry. Next time I am looking for a Brazilian dinning experience I will try a locally owned establishment.",

Can't really go wrong with Fogo De Chao. :)   My favorite meat is their house special, Picanya and lamb chops but honestly they are all amazing. Second favorite would be the garlic beef filet mignon. Every time I go here, I am tempted to order a bunch of their cheese breads to go!",

    "text": "We tried Fogo de Chao out on a Friday night for my husband's Birthday. It is a very large restaurant with a nice atmosphere. There is not much to choose from on the food menu; basically, for $54.95 you get everything, which is all the meats and full salad bar. The meats were very good. The salad bar is amazing. Unfortunately, the service was not. After taking our orders and bringing over a few side dishes that accompany the $54.95 per head, our waiter never returned. After sitting for approximately 15 minutes waiting for our bill, we flagged down a bus boy, when we finally received our bill, the total was incorrect. The bus boy took the bill back and when he returned with it a second time, it was still incorrect, the third time, it was finally the correct bill.  Don't know what ever happened to our waiter. Overall, the food was very good, but a bit pricey. Obviously, our experience was lacking in service.",

Items at the salad bar tasted fresh so that was good but I still only made one trip. Nothing was good enough for seconds. All in all the meal was great and features a ton of meat. If you like very well seasoned and perfectly cooked meat this is your place. I don't know how anyone can leave here and not be on the verge of a food coma!",

Been here a few times and just recently figured out that lunch can be had for 30 vs 50 for dinner for all the exact same foods, but the only problem is that it's difficult to go back to work when you're fighting a food coma! If you've never been the red/green card controls whether the servers come around to give you meat or not.   Fogo has tons of cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and chicken! My favorites are the beef ribs that you usually have to request, the filet mignon/rib eye, and lamb chops. I usually skip the chicken and pork cause they are not always super tender and every time I've had the parmesan pork it's been a little tough.   The salad bar is well stocked as well with various cheeses and and cured meats and smoked salmon as well and provides a nice break from the meat. They also have a few hot items on the side such as the pao de queijo (cheesy bread) that is awesome and I really enjoy the caramelized bananas and polenta as well!",

If you want a good cut of meat you have to ask specifically for it and even then you get one small paper thin slice. And while you are still chewing they are trying to give you your bill.",

We had a waiter that walked so close to us with a tray of ribs but we couldn't get him to come over. We asked other waiters to help but that didn't work. He eventually came around but.... Salad bar is fantastic.  Hearts of palm, lox, prosciutto, lovely dried meats and great cheeses.  These little cheese rolls that come gratis to your table are pure bliss.  Dessert was great. Creme brulee Good value for money",

The meats were very high quality, spiced really well and kept my eyes open waiting for more food. We went as a part of Phoenix Restaurant week and they were nice enough to pack our complementary dessert to go, because the meat was just too much.   Service was good, not the most fantastic in the world but I never had to wait for more food.   I only wish the lamb had come out more often. But I wish I had room for the second time their signature prime filet came out. That was the bomb dot com.  The Mango Refresco drink was amazing, but not quite $16 good.   Definitely make a reservation if you're there on a Friday, cause its Scottsdale packed. You will see a lot of rich white old guys taking out these fake-boobs twenty-somethings too. Which is hilarious.",

The meat was so good and they brought it right to your table, there was a few meats that were on the drier side, mostly the chicken but other than that it was excellent. The drinks are strong but yummy. The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because we were here celebrating an anniversary (as many are celebrating something) we could hardly have a conversation, every 4 minutes an employee would ask how everything is, if we need anything. This wasn't the meat carvers doing this, it was just too much. Asking once is good with me and if I need something I will let you know. It kind of just got old after a while, I know they want to make sure everyone is taken care of but if they would give you more privacy while eating I would give this place 5 stars",

We asked to be seated in a more secluded area, which happened to be by a dining room filled with teenagers taking selfies, shouting, and running amok.   From the moment we sat down we felt rushed. \"Here's your bread, here's your non-refillable soda, go to the salad bar, here's some meat, are you done? No. Are you done now? No.\" The servers stopped at our table even when our signs on the table told them not to.   The food itself was mediocre. The potato salad was good, the mashed potatoes were salty, and all the meats were cooked rare and had a hint of butane and lighter fluid to them.   It reminded me of a buffet in Reno when a high school sports tournament is in town. It was so incredibly loud and crowded and definitely not worth the $100+ check. Good grief, never again.",

They have delicious vegetables, cheeses, Italian meats, and more. They also have beans and rice as well. All the meat they bring around to your table is delicious and it's all you can eat!

Bring meat now!\"    Servers arrive with skewered meats (rare, medium, well) and you get to choose where they slice, using your tongs to grab hold of it.  I believe they had 16 different meats and/or cuts but take care not to miss one by following the picture pamphlet they give to first timers.  There are plentiful refills on cheese rolls, sauteed bananas, and fried polenta.  If you're not heavily into meat, then you'll want to make use of these free refills.  The salad bar wasn't as widely stocked with veggies as I wanted.  It was lacking in that area.    Given that I went during lunch, we'll assume dinner time salad bar selections are much more plentiful.  But for the price, it would have to be twice as good.  For me to give 5 stars, FdC would need to improve the veggie selections and offer dessert in the price.",

It's  $49.95 per person, which includes salad bar, mashed potatoes, plantains, etc. and all of the meat you can eat.  I made one trip up for salad and skipped everything else but meat. It's a great deal if you bring your appetite, but if you're not expecting it, that group check is scary.   Cocktail prices are cleverly omitted from the drink menu,  the single, small mixed drink I had weighed in at $13.  Ouch.

Lou, the manager, Dan the customer service manager, and Norma our server were all just amazing. So stopping here would be sufficient right? Maybe but I can't stop..because.....the FOOD. I don't know where to start...the salad bar with all kinds of fresh h'oduerves - giant asparagus, fresh mozarella balls, zuchinni, salads etc...or handsome men walking around with pipping hot beautiful cooked meats (16 to be exact) on gigantic metal prongs sliced so thin so that you can savor the flavor either plain or with a cup of delicious salsa or some kind of cilantro dipping..I couldn't choose...so there you go. Last but not least the dessert. It was my mother's birthday so she ordered the tres leche cake. I've had plenty of tres leche cakes in my life but this particular one at Fogo was the most moist, and succulent that I've ever had the pleasure of eating. If someone were to ask me if I'd ever return I would have to look at them like they were missing some brain cells because my answer will ALWAYS be YAAAASS!!!",

Not the usual salad bar, loved the grilled vegetables and all different types of chillies & cheese! The only reason, I gave it  4 stars instead of 5, was because the lamb chops were less frequent than any other meats! But the food was really good. We also had creme brulee and cheesecake as desert. Was to die for...I highly recommend this place as it offers great steaks  & it is a unique experience!",

Meat is usually very good, today a lot of it was dry and often when you asked for rare you got med well or they would say they would come  back with a more rare cut and didn't.  The big disappointment was the service though. Our drinks were constantly empty we never got the sides that go with the meats either and could never make eye contract with a server to ask! Finally when we were done he magically appeared and after being asked offered to bring them then, after we will full! He then took 15 minutes to bring check and another 15 minutes to bring back the bank card only to find he mixed it up with a different table!   Huge huge disappointment, as much as I want to love this place I doubt we will return.",

    "text": "This was my first trip to Fogo and it was a special outing for a graduating friend. I must say that I was concerned about strict dress codes since we both wore shorts - 98 degree weather outside. A few meats were on the dry side, but that's to be expected, mostly small cuts, chicken and one pork item. The beef stood out, specifically the house specials. The market fresh salad bar is very generous and well-stocked and I know not to fill up on those goodies before I have a chance to taste some of the meats. I will make Fogo my monthly outing from now on.   The staff is helpful and they're always on hand if you have questions or have special requests. The dessert portions are gargantuan, so you can share one dessert with your significant other. Their drink selection surpasses most places I have patronized in the past, although we settled for Guarana.   This has been hands down the best experience I have had at any select restaurant in Arizona, bar none. I have traveled around the country and around the world, and I am a gourmet chef with three decades experience - also taught gourmet cooking classes, and I must say that I have never had better service, even at places costing five times as much. Before you waste time and money at mediocre shops, try this first!",

We got there just after they re-opened for the dinner hours around 5:15pm and were immediately seated. They explained the system with the green/red disc and off we went. EVERYONE was friendly and very knowledgeable. I have to mention Chris and Lou. You guys went above and beyond the service you usually get from anywhere. If these guys aren't management, they need to be. They stopped by to check on us a few times but not enough to be annoying. We were given a creme brulee from Chris at the end of our dinner and also engaged in some friendly conversations as well. My wife LOVED it. The meats were amazing(we tried almost all of them). I really only had one complaint and that is the pork ribs were not \"fall-off-the-bone\" like most rib places serve them and how we like them. They were a little tough. Keep doin what your doin because your doin everything right. We will be back for sure. Thanks FdC for a great anniversary dinner.",

    "text": "We have to throw out kkdkat F's review. What the hell is it with people reviewing a business that isn't open yet?  My experience was fortunately when they were open. I went Saturday night, their third day open, and it was a glorious night. I missed the 6:30 reservation but still only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. They were very accommodating with my friends 2 year old and did not charge us for her to sit at the table and eat scraps of his food. If you have never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse (as I hadn't) it is a ridiculous idea. You flip the card to green when you want food, and red when you don't want food. Problem is that the food guys come so much that a mere 45 seconds of \"green\" will have your plate full of more meat than you could possibly consume. To offset this meat bonanza, they do offer a salad bar.   The place kind of reminds me of a Golden Corral, but upscale, where you don't have to get it yourself. The clientele is old, overweight, and un-sophisticated as you would expect at an all you can eat restaurant. The price ($42.50) is high enough only to discourage the dredges of society. I saw quite a few younger people out on dates, probably not ones that would have the palate to appreciate even restaurants at half this cost.   The salad bar alone ($19) was more than well enough equipped. Featuring 8-10 different salads, raw vegetables, and a few cold cuts. Each meal includes three sides that are shared family style, a fried banana, mashed potatoes, and polenta which are all replaced the moment you finish one. The trick if you do not want another, is to leave a bite of it on the platter. They wont replace it if it isn't finished. They also bring the most delicious bread imaginable that has a warm, gooey, cheesy center. The two year old ate 6 of them.  Meat service includes 15 different types of meat here, of which I tried about 8 and they were all on the decent to good range. The only exception to it being the lamb chop which we both agreed was the loser of the bunch, with the favorite being either the bacon wrapped filet, garlic beef, or the parmesan encrusted pork chop. All items are served in small portions, enabling you to try several different ones. I don't think I had two of anything. It is definitely a huge meal and my recommendation is to eat nothing all day, and then be very concerned what your cardiologist might say afterward.   The restaurant is probably going to last through this depression at least, as they serve in high volume and turn a lot of tables. It isn't uppity enough to turn away the low end clientele, and it isn't crappy enough to turn away the affluent folks. The service is spectacular. I don't think I asked for one thing all night, and the food is good. My only gripe is the meats were all very well cooked, which is obviously a testament to most peoples tastes and not wanting to actually taste the meats. It would have been nice to have a \"rare\" option, but the did decline the request.",

My 5 year old was free and 10 year old was half off 3.) Ok food  the Bad.. 1.) Our server who we became friendly with must have gotten off somewhere around midpoint of our dinner and vanished forever. i understand they work as a team but it was strange.  2.) The salad bar was ok but other than the mozerella balls and chicken salad nothing to sing about.  3.) The meat all tasted the same. The gouchos are a little boderline rude even to a 5 year old who is clearly confused why there is 8 men stickings swords of meat in his face. Calm down a little please.  4.) At almost $50 a person before drinks and dessert Ruth Chris is a MUCH BETTER OTION!  5.) Even with the kids being pretty much free it was still $300 for 3 adults. We all had one soda and shared three desserts between the table.  We left there kind of puzzled like well we might go back for lunch maybe but I don't know. 6.) I wanted to buy  a mozerella ball to take home to my nanny. I was willing to pay $15 or $20 for on little ball and they wouldn't sell it to me. Now come on people we just spent $300 on dinner throw me a bone.  Overall Not the experience we were hoping for but not the worst place I have ever eaten.",

I made reservations for 8, but we were running very late so I called & asked if we could push it back to 9 & they were very accommodating.   When we finally arrived we were immediately seated in the full dining room. Our server gave us the break down of how they operate here & told us we could get started at the salad bar. We each got a plateful of yummy veggies, cured meats & cheeses. Our favs from the salad bar were: parmesan & manchego cheeses, prosciutto, artichokes, salami, asparagus & mushrooms. After that we flipped our cards to the green side & a slew of meats were presented. We tried 2 or 3 at a time, then flipped to the red side to sample & then flipped back to green when we were ready for more (you'll understand what red & green means when you go!). We tried 10 different meats & our top 4 favs were: picanha-top sirloin (their signature steak), cordeiro-lamb legs & chops & beef ancho-rib eye. Included with the endless meat options are 3 side dishes: polenta, garlic mashed potatoes & caramelized bananas, you also receive a basket of pao de queijo-cheese bread. The sides were just ok, the potatoes were the best, but that cheese bread was so yummy!   Total for everything including drinks (no cocktails) but not including tip was $107. Not cheap, but considering the amount of food you could possibly get, it's worth it! Not a place I would go to regularly, but it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a meat lover!",

    "text": "I find it hard to believe that the Simpson's have not parodied the Brazilian Steakhouse, yet.  Seems like it would be Homer's fantasy come True.    Came here with a couple of friends who were taking me to lunch for my birthday.  This was my first time eating here, and I always read in the reviews of other places that this is the place that all of the other Brazilian steakhouses in Phoenix are compared to.  This place is top dog for a reason.  The restaurant itself is very nice with white linen, rich wood paneling, and a spacious dining room.    What can you say?  If you are a vegetarian, the salad bar is really incredible.  Figuring we would cushion the blow, we started at the salad bar.  I ended up making a plate for myself resembling an antipasto platter.  It was excellent.  There were cheeses, and prosciutto, marinated asparagus an inch think, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and things I did not identify, but were tasty anyway.  Once we were done dabbling in the vegetables, cheeses, and prosciutto of the salad bar it was time to get down to business; it was time for meat.    Each person has a coaster-like card that is red on one side and green on the other.  We flipped our coasters to green, and immediately we were overwhelmed by an onslaught of meat.    Like Homer would do, I just indiscriminately tried everything.  Don't ask me what I had, because I was too busy talking to my friends, drinking caipirinhas, and eating meat.  There was also polenta, fried banana, black beans, and bread.  Everything was tasty and delicious.  I ate way too much.  I glanced at the dessert menu, but was just too full to even seriously consider it.   The service is outstanding.  The wait staff was falling all over us serving meat, filling drinks, and bringing more bread, bananas, and polenta.  We never were without anything.  If you are interested in a Brazilian steakhouse in the Phoenix area, this is the place to go.",

    "text": "If you have never eaten at a Brazilian churrascaria this place is a pretty good representation of one. Word to the wise...... get ready for a mass intake of meat products.   The menu here is non existent. You sit down, order some beverages, and get down and dirty. The salad bar here is definitely above par for the course (to all of you golfers: the salad bar just shot a 69 at Augusta). I think it had thirty five or so items to excite the palate. Now don't fill up with all of that rabbit food because the next stop is protein town, population you. In my mind I said \"bring on the beef!\" I think that message was picked up subliminally by every waiter in the joint. The moment I was done with my salad our table was surrounded by beautiful glistening beef, lamb, chicken, even a little pork. I made the fatal mistake of thinking I could  try a little of everything. At the end of the meal I was so overloaded with meat products I almost passed out at the table. The quality of the meat and flavors was top notch and highly recommended.  I guess I should also note the service was fantastic. All of the meats are made to order. The lamb was a little over done for my taste and they had a fresh skewer of rare meat out in a flash. All of the drinks were full and the house had a pretty good wine selection.",

    "text": "If you have not yet been to this place and have any sort of respect for being a carnivore, get yourself to FOGO ASAP. I don't think it's possible for anyone to leave this place disappointed. Even a vegetarian would enjoy the wonderful all you can eat salad bar, however if you are trying Fogo for the first time, do not make the rookie mistake and go crazy when they turn you loose on the salad bar. Save every inch of stomach space for the Unlimited amount of 15 different kind of meats that you will be consuming.  So go lithe on that salad bar if you must, turn that card over to green and let the glorious amount of meats be carved right onto your plate. The three side dishes they bring you are delish don't get me wrong, partake in those, but don't go crazy, it's ALL about the meat.   The only think this place could do better was create a separate bathroom to purge so your stomach could hold more meat.   Fogo is pricey, 47 dollars  a head for unlimited food, so if you aren't hungry don't waste your money. They will tell you about their house specialty mojito. It is quite delicious but do beware its 12 dollars and that's not advertised.  Do yourself a favor, if it's a special occasion or your just looking to treat yourself to a great meal, GO HERE. PLEASE. You've earned it. Afterwards  the amount of meat and food you consume, you may feel that you disrespected all the starving people in the world. YES you did. But damnit its worth it.",

    "text": "Hubby and I were here tonight for a grand and glorious breaking of his diet. He had been before to the one in Houston, and had been looking forward to the new Scottsdale location. For being open only 3 nights, the service went quite smoothly and the staff and management we met were all great. We started out with drinks- a gin and tonic ($10) and a caipirinha ($8.25)- both were strong and very good. The wine list is extensive, for those who prefer the vino. Delicious little popovers arrived at the table, and we headed off to the salad bar. Far better and fresher than Fogo E Brasa's, it had a variety of cheeses (including chunks of parm and fresh mozzarella), smoked salmon, prosciutto, salami, sun dried tomatoes, olives, marinated bell peppers, asparagus spears, mushroom caps, and seafood and chicken salads, just to name about a third of the offerings.  Then came a veritable torrent of meat. The beef was the best, and came in a variety of cuts and preparations. We liked the Ancho (rib eye), the Picanha (the classic sirloin cut in the half moon shape), and the garlic beef best. The pork ribs were really well done and juicy, and the sausage was quite flavorful. The chicken was a tad dry, and the lamb was too gamey for our liking (and we usually like lamb).   Side dishes were brought to our table, in appropriately modest portions. There were squares of polenta, which I really liked but Hubby did not care for, and mildly garlic mashed potatoes, and yummy fried plantains.   Dessert choices were pretty typical: a creme brulee, a flan, 2 types of cheesecake, and 2 types of chocolate cake. Hubby wanted what he had enjoyed at the Houston Fogo before: the papaya cream topped with creme de cassis liqueur ($8.25). It was more runny than mousse-y, and the papaya taste was pretty subtle, with the liqueur being the top note.  There is a rather unnecessary valet parking service for $3, when the parking lot surrounding the place is huge. Not so huge, however,  that the many douche-bags who double parked went unnoticed. The bathrooms are nice. The dinner, which is all you care to eat, is $42.50 per person. I'm sure we'll be back for special occasions.",

    "text": "Fogo de Chao was a complete disappointment. $55 per person for the \"full experience\" which includes a buffet style market table and endless meats that are served table side. Nothing else was mentioned by our server so we thought we'd give it a try. This was both our first and last time dining here.   The market table was complete crap. Don't let quantity over quality fool you. It's essentially a salad bar of typical charcuterie plate items...some meats, cheeses, fruit, roasted veggies, and some random side salad type dishes like apple salad, chickpea salad, chicken salad, etc. -- none of which felt remotely Brazilian and none of which were good. Nothing exotic or prepared, really. I can pick up any of these items at a local grocery store.   Then the Gauchos come by with meat on a stick that they shave off table side. We only had about 1/3 of the meats listed on the menu because that was all that was circulating in our area for some reason. Yes, we flipped the \"we want meat\" coasters to green. The meat was fine, but nothing special and again, nothing really Brazilian about it aside from the stylized service. We kept getting shaved off the edges, so it wasn't a good solid piece of meat, just like a light crust from the cooking process with a little meat. We asked for horseradish to help elevate the meats. We had our menus for about 5 minutes and only knew about the horseradish because we overheard another table ask. No other sauces were offered. I found out they had more sauces looking at their website after we left.  They brought a couple of sides like mashed potatoes (bland, tasted like reconstituted potato flakes), caramelized bananas (delicious), and Pao De Queijo (bread - delicious), and some other plantain type french fry. These were the most Brazilian tasting items of the entire night. They were mostly good. From their website, it looks like we maybe did not get served all of the sides we were supposed to?  We had the tres leches cake for desert. Also boring and no flavor, much like everything else at this restaurant.   Tables were way too close together. We sat next to two younger guys who were yelling over all of the hustle and bustle of the place and couldn't hear our own conversation. They could do with less tables crowding the place. Believe it or not, I'm under 35 years old and saying these things.  This place was quite busy, which is understandable around the holidays, but they did not staff accordingly. Service was terrible. They clearly favored the larger parties which were plentiful. Took forever to get anything, which all we ever asked for was horseradish and our check. Never came around to check on us. We literally got up and poured our own water from the cart that was by our table, no one cared or noticed.   $150 out the door for an underwhelming meal for two with a shared dessert. I would have MUCH rather spent my money on Steak 44! This was a HUGE disappointment and waste of time, money, and calories. We will not return and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place.",

We've always experienced great service, the food is always wonderful, and the upkeep of the restaurant is impeccable. But not this time.        This place has gone to the dogs, literally.  So, we went there for Thanksgiving and they sat us in the back next to a family who decided it was okay to bring their dog with them. Not a service animal, just their pet. The dog proceeded to throw up on the floor and the patrons, instead of informing the wait staff, decided to just throw a napkin over it. So I let the wait staff know that the smell was making me feel nauseous so they moved us to a different table. However; the staff decided that leaving the dog vomit on the floor  was an option. The rest of the time that we were there they didn't clean it up. Also, they never asked  the family to remove the dog from the restaurant.       Next, the bathroom was appalling. The trash was overflowing and falling on the ground. Two of the stalls had toilet paper on the floor and urine was on the toilet seat. You would think during this busy time that they would've had someone policing the bathroom on a regular basis to make sure that it was clean.      And then to top everything off when it was time for us to pay the bill the manager came back to the table to ask us what our debit card look like because they couldn't find it. Needless to say I was very disappointed with this entire experience.",

The waiter was very kind and took care of us and after suggesting we try the higher priced buffet with the lure of higher priced meats such as filet mignon, we went for it. I should've listened to my gut-- the selection that did come out was great, but only one piece of the higher end meats that was promised came around. Everything else was something we could have enjoyed at the lower dinner price. So basically we over payed and didn't get what was promised to us.   As for everything else, it was nice experience and we decided to just be grateful for the opportunity to enjoy the dinner.",

The service was awesome and it was worth the hefty price.  However during this visit, I was really disappointed. We made reservations and said it was for an anniversary. Six months ago they sat us in a quieter section of the restaurant because we were a couple, however this time they sat us in the most concentrated area next to a wall. I don't care about seating most of the time, however there were very loud and large families next to us, and I was banging elbows with the guy behind me.  Our server came by and said he was brand new. My girlfriend and I were okay with this, and he ended up being the best (and only good part of this visit). He was really nice and we tipped extra because of him. He recommended the Brazilian Limeades which were amazing by the way.  However the fun stops there promptly. The salad bar was okay, but it seemed lackluster compared to the visit before. The meat was also incredibly disappointing. Even though I requested medium rare, I was only given slices that were 90% charcoal and had the consistency of a leather sole of a boot.  The chicken was burned and the steaks just seemed so well done, there was barely any flavor left. Some of the choices were alright though. The Parmesan Pork was super good and the lamb was excellent.  All in all it was disappointing though. I give three stars because of the server. He may be new, but he did a great job.",

It was definitely not up to our expectations based on our experience at similar establishments  We were very disappointed with the quality of the cuts of meat being served. Alot was tough and stringy and in some cases overcooked to the point of being hard to cut with a steak knife.   The Feijoada bar was not being restocked fast enough to keep up with demand. Empty soup kettles, no lettuce etc.  Staff appeared to be trying but was just not clicking. It was like everyone was trying to do everything all at once. A orchestra all playing to their own time with no conductor.    We had 2 staffers try to take our drink order after it had been placed. We would sit for what seemed like forever with empty meat plates then have a line of people trying to serve us.  The same situation only to a lesser degree occurred with beverages. Empty glasses followed by being topped off after every sip.  Again the staffers were nice and really trying. I am not sure if management was lacking organization or micro-managing to the point that staffers were handicapped. Maybe we were in a serving zone transition and the staff was sure who's table it was.   Bottom line lackluster food and questionable service.",

The steaks were warm and cooked nicely, and all were great. I probably tried at least 6 or 7, and were pleased with them all. My least favorite was the lamb, my fave the bacon filet I believe it was. Its pricey for sure, and was very crowded on the night we went back in October. My only complaint was the buffet was kinda ho-hum and the tables are too close together. We were crammed in there like sardines with 0 privacy whatsoever. In the words of Ahnold... \"I'll be back.\"",

Those taxes, those unfinished roads, and asbestos in some schools all becomes a far off memory when you are here.  Right when you enter you are greeted by peeps who act like they got a degree from a four year university on etiquette and service. You'll be sat down and have your drink order taken (per usual) and then the dining begins.  PRO TIP: Don't eat a lot of the salad bar - the main attraction is the meat. I never realized that meat could be served in such large portions. Shish kabobs were my only foray into this type of fine dining, but Fogo showed me I was an amateur with every bite!  The rounds are unlimited as long as you can keep flipping that card and have room in that tummy to spare. It was a hefty price tag at the end, but some things in life are worth it, and a trip to Fogo De Chao is one of them.",

    "text": "First timer.   I'm about 3 months pregnant and have been craving red meat, so what's better than a Brazilian steak house?   1) On weekends make reservations early or you may be stuck waiting until 9pm or later.   2) It's not your typical salad bar. There are lots of artisan meats and cheeses. Lots of veggies zucchini, asparagus, mushrooms, etc... however perhaps I was preoccupied with the crowd but everything is ice cold. I'm not sure why I thought the steamed seasoned zucchini sitting in ice would be hot. I wasn't the biggest fan of eating cold cooked vegetables.   3) They provide mashed potatoes, fried bananas, some other sort of fried stick and bread. The potatoes were ok, but I think they're instant. Upon reading other reviews the fried sticks are polenta??  Not sure, was not explained to us by the server. Other reviewers also claim the bread is cheese bread, I did not taste cheese or see any presence of cheese, those were also ok.   4) The Meat. Ok, so my husband made it a point I try as much variety of meat possible. The bacon wrapped chicken was very dry, we didn't even finish it. The beef that was severed was cooked to my liking however the crust was very salty. You could still see the coarse salt crystals from their rub. The pork also very dry. My husband loved the lamb, I personally found it too gamey, but that is my personal preference.   5) I attempted to order the Creme Brulee but was told by the server they frequently run out early almost every night. I opted for the papaya in cream. I read the description but thought the sauce drizzled over was some sort of condensed milk with the name having Creme in it. Turns out the Creme was a type of liquor, having a sensitive pregnancy I would have liked that to have been explained prior to drowning my dessert in this.    Overall my experience was ok. I'd prefer to stick to Vegas buffets for the price. I don't think I would return.",

If you like unlimited salad bar and lots of different cuts of sirloin, you'll be happy. But not at $50 per!  The rib eye was ok. The filet was very dry. Everything is bathed in salt.  Want shrimp? That's extra. Want sea bass? Extra.  The place was packed. It was clean. The service was friendly and no one was rushing anyone.  Not the place to come for the best cuts of beef. Sirloin, sirloin, sirloin everywhere. The other cuts came around infrequently.  The pork rib was dry and flavorless. The pork sausage was sickening.  The chicken wing was dry and overcooked. I did not try the lamb or the beef rib.",

Fogo de Chao provides an endless selection of meats brought to your table on enormous skewers by waiters dressed in gauchos. The garlic sirloin, lamb chops, and house prime sirloin are delish! You'll also get family style side dishes of sweet bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread rounds. Be careful, those cheese rounds are addictive!   The cocktail and wine menu provides tasty options and be sure to save some room for the dessert- I HIGHLY recommend the tres leches cake.   The service is stellar - everyone is friendly and helpful. Don't see what you want? Just ask and it'll be brought to your table pronto.

Don't turn your card to \"red\" for too long or they will clean up the whole table and kick you out! That's the worst and it has unfortunately happened to me more than once.",

    "text": "Vegetarians, stay home.  This place is a meat lover's paradise. I don't think I've ever eaten so much meat in my entire life.  But before the meat service begins, you start your meal over at the gourmet salad bar, which was not why I was there. After picking up a couple olives and leaves of lettuce, and a slice or two of onion, I felt good about having a nice balanced meal.  Back at the table, it's time for the real food to begin. The servers come by immediately, bringing a dozen different kinds of meat, filling up your plate as many times as you can handle. Lots of beef, like top and bottom sirloin, filet mignon, ribs, and ribeye, plus lamb chops, leg of lamb, pork ribs, parmesan-encrusted pork loin, chicken with or without being wrapped in bacon (like I'd eat chicken that's not wrapped in bacon), and sausage. Every meat was delicious, tender and juicy, full of amazing Brazilian flavors.  Also included with the meal were various side dishes, like a pretty good cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and carmelized bananas - but I was here to eat meat, so I didn't have a lot of those.  In the end, I don't know how much I ate - I'd guess each portion to be around 2-3 ounces, and I probably had at least 20 portions (everything at least once, several things twice), so probably around 3 pounds of meat. With all the different flavors constantly coming, it always seemed fresh and new.  At $62 (including soft drink, tax, and tip), it's a little more than I typically spend on a meal, but well worth it. This is definitely a place I'll be back to, maybe a few times a year. It will take that long to recover from my meat-induced coma anyway.",

The salad bar is out of this world and the schmorgesborg of delicious meats being shoved in your face is an experience! My one qualm is the meat was a little over salted and obviously the price doesn't leave for an every friday night kind of place. Still it is a must for \"experience dining\"",

My sister really enjoyed the ribs which for some reason I didn't try since I was hooked on the lombo.  Huge wine list and I had a glass but when I go back and I will go back I will elect not to have wine so I can try their rum speciality drink that they bring around on a cart. Desserts were nothing fancy. Had the creme brulee but honestly I've had better.  Full 5 stars for the choices and service.  Oh and they bring these cooked bananas to the table along with some bread type things. Both were delicious but I only had one bread type thing since I wanted to save room for the meat.  Craving the lombo as I write this... Mmmmm.",

    "text": "Welcome to meat heaven. If you don't like meat, stay away, you will probably faint just walking by their large, glass room of ribs just roasting tenderly.... begging you to come in and take a bite...  Whatever you do, don't eat the salad buffet first. You will get full off of the gigantic vegetables (asparagus the side of a baby's arm, I'm not even joking), and not have any room for the variety of meats these Aladdin-pant-wearing, sword-holding employees have in store for you.   Waiter immediately explains to us that there is no menu. \"Wha?\" I say. He basically explains that they come around with the chunks of meat on swords and will place as much as you'd like on your plate. It will include steak, chicken, lamb, etc. etc. The coaster on the table is red on one side, green on the other. If you are ready to eat, flip the card to green! When you want a red, don't forget to flip to red or else the men will just keep coming by to offer more meat!  Very spacious place, lots of attentive people waiting on you.  I got a little intimidated at first with all the swords flying by my head, but their 'Brazilian national drink' calmed me down. It tasted like a margarita with hints of vodka.  The whole time that we're eating I'm wondering how much this is gonna cost, I'm thinking it's gonna be super expensive since it's so good and there is no limit to how much to eat! It came out to about $30/person. Not bad at all! Come with your starving stomach, because there will be plenty to try out and it is so delicious!",

    "text": "WOW!  This is my first 5-star review for a restaurant.  I believe that 5th star should be held for something really special that made a place stand out.  Fogo did that for me last night.  We wanted to go to a Churrascaria for our anniversary, and being the good Yelper that I am, I read the reviews for Fogo and \"the other one\" which is a couple of miles from my house.  Decided, based on Yelp, to make the drive to Scottsdale.  Great decision.  I made reservations online and noted that it was my anniversary.  Got there and was seated promptly.  Since it was our first time there we got the run down on the coaster signals and the wine specials and then we were off to the salad bar.  The salad bar was good.  Not particularly large, but the selections were not your ordinary salad fair.  It had fresh mozzarella, blocks of Parmesan to shave, salmon, marinated mushrooms, asparagus.  Just great, fresh stuff of which I tried not to over do because of the meat fest I was saving myself for.  That's where the fun begins.  As soon as we flipped our coaster to green...BAM...meat was at our table in 2 seconds.  No joke.  Top sirloin, Parmesan crusted pork loin, pepper crusted lamb, fresh sausages, chicken etc.. Medium rare is medium rare, just the way I like it.  I could go on and on about how well all the meats were cooked.  Tender, juicy, FLAVOR.  For those who do not like a lot of pepper, stay away from the lamb as it is definitely pepper crusted.  I personally couldn't get enough.  Not seeing the meat you want?  Just ask a Gaucho and it will be there within minutes. The fried Polenta dusted with Mozzarella was so flippin good, I'm going to have to try it myself.   After going into protein shock I decided I was done.  My wife wanted just a little taste of chocolate mousse if they had it.  They came back with a piece of the most delicious cake I have ever had in my life on a plate that had \"Happy Anniversary\" drizzled out on the plate..complementary.  That was the 5th star! The price wasn't that bad, but the drinks are a bit pricey.  Dinner with 3 cocktails was $140.  That is more than worth it for a great atmosphere, friendly servers and Gaucho's, terrific food, and genuine hospitality.    This is my new go-to place for family, friends, and business colleagues.  Great job!",

Welcome to the Fogo de Chao experience.  Meat orgy! It's absolutely magnificent, take over half a dozen different piping hot well prepared varieties of meat including top sirloin, bottom sirloin, Filet Mignon, pork loin, beef ribs, pork ribs, and lamb stuffed onto skewers that could double as props for a film about Roman gladiators. Hand said savory redolent skewers to an assorted band of servers that seem to dance in and out of crowded tables full of people with amazing ease all at the beck and call of a little piece of paper. It's fantastic! They have wonderful sides as well including caramelized bananas, polenta, and garlic mashed potatoes. There is also a salad bar, and I think it was nice but quite honestly wasn't the analogy about the damn lion the point here?  Happy hunting.",

I arrived first and the rest of our party was running late so I was offered a seat at the bar and looked over the menu while my friends joined me. I was asked by staff passing a few times if I needed anything and was eventually brought out a basket of fresh bread while I waited. Once we were seated, our server gave us the run down and we made our way to the salad bar. It was sizable, but not as huge as I expected. Knowing what was ahead of me, I just sampled a few things, all of which were very fresh. I was more than ready to start with the meats. Lots and lots of meats everywhere you looked. My favorites were the parmesan crusted pork and garlic beef. The servers were very kind, offering numerous times to go back for a different cut or cook of meat if we wanted. The sides were also good, loved the mashed potatoes and crispy polenta. I do wish they had bigger containers of the sides as they were quickly gone. I had a caipirinha in the spirit of things, which was a great drink. We ended the meal with dessert, the cheesecake was rich and delicious.   It is definitely a special occasion type of place, but I would absolutely recommend it to others and will keep it on my short list for when I win the lotto :)",

The lamb and pork ribs stood out as exceptional.

I have literally eaten twice what my stomach can hold both times.  Part of the reason is that it's fairly expensive, $50/person, and I feel like I need to get my money's worth. LOL. But the bigger part is that it is genuinely good food. The salad bar is good with plenty to choose from and the sides (plantains, polenta, and potatoes) are also good. When you first sit down the bring you these little cheesy, doughy bread cubes. I have no freakin idea what they are called but they are awesome. Then the meat, this is what you come here for and this is what I over indulge on.  I'm really suffering now but an hour ago I was in meat heaven.  The lamb shanks and the bacon wrapped filet mignon are why I come here. Both were cooked perfectly and were juicy and full of flavor. I believe I sampled everything that they offered except for maybe one thing. The chicken was a lil dry but everything else was good. The service was fine as well. I have to take away 1 star because this isn't Morton's or Ruth's Chris or another top-shelf steak house. I'm actually glad that I can dress casual at Fogo because eating this quantity of food while wearing a suit would suck balls! As it is now, I'm laying on the couch hoping I can eliminate some of this excess food before bed while my idiot chihuahua hops around on my stomach. I'm so meat drunk that I can't summon the will to stop him. I'm actually hoping if he jumps on my stomach enough, it will induce vomiting and some of this pressure can be released. That being said, Fogo was awesome again. Many thanks to my wife for taking me here on my birthday. Hit it up, you won't regret it. Ok, maybe you will temporarily, but it's worth it.",

When they tell you the waiters will attack you with skewers of meat if you keep the card green, they really will come to you nonstop. They kind of rush off quickly, so state that you also want a piece if they are at your table.   The only reason why I dinged a star off was because when my dad asked for a piece of rare filet mignon, the server said none of the pieces were rare but he would get another skewer. Another server came by a few minutes later with another skewer and cut the most well-done piece of meat before rushing off.",

However that changed and full skewers started coming out and the meat was exceptionally done and very tasty, the lamb was my favorite as was the house steak. Dessert if you had room was awesome for $10 so would I go back yes, about once every 3 years!",

The food was amazing and you can really get a lot of different types of meats. Which all all very flavorful. I'm giving a 4 star only because we got a couple rounds of meat and then our plates were completely empty. So I kinda just stared at the manager and he saw as sent the next four guys from the kitchen straight to our table. I guess that was okay but waiting 5 minutes to be seen sucked.",

I didn't care for the little bread puffs at all, I thought they were greasy. Then the market buffet / salad bar, lots of options and I really enjoyed that and made 2 trips to have some variety in between the meats. We ordered one of their special old fashioned drinks with carmelized pineapple, they never brought it, upon asking again they brought us a traditional old fashioned and were out of the carmelized pineapple..... ok, disappointing. Menu price for the drink was $15, charged $16, no big deal but really? Meats were slow to start but then came frequently. My issue was the cut of meats, we finally asked for fillet and they brought us our own fillet. Seems the most inexpensive meats are served in plenty and had to ask fir a second small piece of sirloin. Since significant other enjoyed it very much we will probably be back. I will ask for the cuts of meat I want next time and not try the others. Would I recommend them, I don't think so.",

On May 21, 2016 the service was ok, the bar was not stocked with three wines that I ordered ($35-$45 a bottle and the bartender tried upselling to a $70+ bottle of wine, the meats ranged from being delightful to fatty and gristly. Don't be afraid to putting bad meat aside.  The filet mignon was generally very good. Hold out for that.  The chicken and pork cuts were not very good.  Three of us amassed a $200 bill, which I was prepared for, but I doubt that I will try this restaurant again.",

The meat was very tough and everything just about tasted the same! My husband and I decided to go out for a much needed date night. We had 7:30 reservations and we were seated promptly! That was good. But once we were seated it took 10 minutes for someone to come and greet our table. Meanwhile, a party of four were seated after us and they were greeted right away! Finally, the server came over and did his bit but it was very lack-luster. Finally we got our drinks and went to the salad bar. I turned my card over and it took several minutes for the any of the Gauchos to make their way over to us. Once they showed up the meat was tough and burnt! Our bill was $165.00 with tip. Ugh! Now I don't mind paying top dollar for good food and service, but that was a bit ridiculous! I should have gone to Orange Sky instead! I rarely write bad reviews, but this place deserved it!",

Come here hungry as if you want to eat a horse, because that's exactly what is going down in here.  - the salad bar deserves an A+ . - all you can (eat/handle) banana fritters. Lord.....A+",

First and foremost the entire staff is on point with seamless service, they are professional, personable,  and extremely knowledgeable = 5 star service !  Love the interior -classy, clean, simple elegance.  The salad bar completely blew my mind with its gorgeous/ inviting appearance. Not a wilted veggie in sight just fresh looking lush colored choices, asparagus, and artichokes O MY GOSH were as great as they looked. Prosciutto, and cheese was dy-no-mite !  Great looking breads.. feared i would now live vicariously through watching Erich enjoy all that crusty, soft goodness (and the s.o.b makes it look so damn good ..grrrrr !!! ) NO- not this night  as they offer GLUTEN-FREE ...5 stars for the salad bar !  I also love the concept of flipping the card from red to green (red light, green light 123) ha ha  ...I digress.  THE MEAT ...TA-DA !  carved table side is succulent ..savory ..tender ...utter bliss Picanha,  and Alcatra positively melted like butter .The lamb according to my sexy Non GF bread eater was amazing . Caipirinha drinks were Fabu,  and refreshing . We also had so much fun. ..we left sated and feeling sexy .I love when that happens.  Fogo is going to the top of my five star list for it's outstanding service, mouth-watering meat,  GF friendly,  and THE SEXIEST salad bar !  I might never cook again.....  update:   Still amazing I am in love with the salad bar!",

    "text": "I am quite disappointed with my last visit during restaurant week.. I've been coming here for the last 3 years, from the first time to the last, boy was there a huge difference! Three years ago I came in for my birthday and had this fun amazing server who stuck by my table and up sold the crap out of us, but he was so great at it that it was just like \"take my money, and stick around!\" -definitely would had given him a 5 star alone!  This last Saturday for restaurant week was very different [ hope it wasn't different because of restaurant week]. We were greeted by a male server, he went through the process for my parents and spouse, and told us how everyones our server, we ordered a drink and went straight to the salad bar. After we finished our greens, we immediately turned over that nice little red card to green! All the delicious meats were coming to our table, but our waters and drink were low, couldn't find our original server or the water person, so we had to flag someone down.   One of the carvers brought over I believe it was their pork sausage, I took one and my spouse took one, then right before I bit into mine I hear my BF ask the carver \" Umm sir can I get another one that's not stuffed with hair?\" The guy looked back but didn't come back so I called for him again, he came back and we were trying to explain the situation to him and he just gave us another sausage, and of course the water guy is just standing there frozen, looking at our plate with what looks like hair on it then looks at us, then walks off.. we asked the carver to grab a server or manager, but he walks off, so we had to flag down a server ourselves. Danya was the first server to actually respond to our situation even though other servers were standing near by doing nothing and we couldn't get their attention. We explained to her what had happened, and I'm sure this has rarely happened [I hope] and asked for her to remove the plate and just get us a new one... few seconds later a manager came over to apologize and explain to us how they grill everything on an open flame and sometime bristles debris can land on top of their meat.   Well that's great to hear, but the problem was it looked like coarse long black hair and it was INSIDE of the sausage, not on top or wrapped around it, he then went on to explain how he doesn't know how that could have happened since there weren't any female chefs on... regardless we just wanted an apology, a new plate and just for them to know to keep a closer eye on their food because it was one of the most disturbing things I've seen at a restaurant. The manager then gave my BF the option to order anything off the regular dessert menu, by this time he kind of lost his appetite already which was unfortunate... we ended up getting the Tres Leche cake option and Creme Brule.  All in all this visit didn't leave my parents or BF with the greatest first time experience...  SIDE NOTE*** All the servers pool tips, but I honestly only saw Danya, a dirty blonde gentleman and someone who looked like he was watching over the servers, working and attending to customers. Our original server who greeted us just stood to the side and chatted for the whole hour we were there, only time he even did anything was when we got his attention and asked for a fresh plate and when he initially greeted us...   I honestly didn't think it was fair to see some of the servers working harder than others and having to split tips with the lazier ones, I even tried personally handing one of them money and thanking them for being so attentive with us, but this person respectfully declined...   Not too sure if I'll ever come back during restaurant week again.. but might continue giving this place another shot, because the food is pretty good here, but when paying about $50 a head, I expect great customer service as well.",

The gauchos were favoring the larger tables and continued walking past our table of four. We all had our green cards flipped, but they still went to the larger tables. We had to call over a gaucho because they weren't stopping at our table. There was one gaucho we asked for a side plate.. he grabbed one and slammed it on the table, it wound up sitting sideways because it landed on a knife. He noticed it, but walked away. I guess that's all in the \"full experience?\"   As a side came out \"mashed potatoes.\" Which tasted like boxed potato flakes.   The meat is nothing to be excited about. I could grill a steak better at home. The market table or whatever it is that they called it... grilled veggies and salads. Nothing special. Nothing exciting. Sadly, I left hungry and annoyed.   This place is basically nothing other than an expensive home town buffet with different clientele.   First time here and a guaranteed last time. Go spend your hard earned money elsewhere.",

Very elegant, modern and feels clean. They have an extensive salad bar that is friendly to every diet type whether you eat everything or you only eat fruits/vegetables. I chose the lunch option where you have essentially unlimited options when it comes to meats, I can't remember what it's called. There really isn't anything special about any of the meats. They have items such as pork, ribs, lamb, chicken, and beef. For the beef, they will accommodate according to how you want it cooked. There was nothing special about how it was cooked though. Majority of their meats came out SO dry and the seasoning is minimal. The course itself is $38 per person which is pretty pricy considering there are other options out there with better quality. I guess the thing that upset me most, is one of the servers, spilled my wine on both my plates, the table, my napkin, and dress. It got everywhere. He handed me new plates and that was about it. I understand accidents happen but I was wearing most of my glass at that point and nothing was done about it. Pretty poor service. I will not be returning and I can't in good consciousness recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

Spent roughly an hour and a half there for my anniversary and not one time did our server check on us, ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks, acknowledge us, nothing. It was like we were literally invisible ;/ We had to ask the water boy and bartender that was going around for refills, clean plates and our check at the end. We didn't even bother getting our anniversary dessert because we knew it wouldn't happen, well and we didn't have a server :/ Needless to say we will  not be back for awhile if ever again and I would say think twice if you are a younger couple on wasting your time and money here!",

There is lamb, garlic chicken, parmesan chicken, bbq chicken legs, sirlon steak, rib eye steak, every kind of sausage you can imagine.   OMG.... if your a meat lover you'll be in meat heaven but I must say the salad bar was by far one of the best I've had.    Considering it's a buffet style salad bar, it was still amazing.    You had a choice of soup to whole roasted garlic. The best  part of Fogo are the waiters who walk around with huge metal skewers. Watching them slice the meat is magical.    If your looking for seafood here they have it too but this place is strictly for the meat lovers!",

Normally I would give this 5 stars however on a recent dining experience we had poor service. They also changed their system for paying, which to be honest is absolutely genius, however we weren't told we needed to present any coupons,  discounts (military)  or anything before our meal and they wouldn't honor any after our meal before we paid. Since this is a fairly new system,  I think it would be beneficial for for customers and staff if the server would ask in advance if anyone has discounts or coupons. The server wouldn't even get the manager for us to speak to him about this concern.  So what should have been about $39 a person ended up being full price and our bill was over $500. I'll know better next time to present everything when we walk in.",

They'll keep coming until you flip the card to green no more.    Expect attentive, friendly and professional service from the ample army of wait staff.

I see from the reviews most feel the same as I do, however, there are a few people out there that seem to not realize that when you roast a steak the size of a small roast, i.e., 2+ pounds it will be more reminiscent of a prime rib, where extremely flavorful on the exterior and tender but less flavorful in the center. No problem! They have a million was to dress it up. Everything from A-1 to chimichurri, but that is not to say that the meat is bland. IT IS FAR from bland!

No one ever cleared our dirty plates or asked if we wanted a clean plates. The only plates we had were from the salad bar. Once you final received your drink don't plan on getting another one.

We felt it would still give us all the meats we needed and the salad bar at the special pricing. This was a mistake.  They give you different circle cards to flip. When you have these, you are treated like the 'red headed step child'. It was as though we had the plague. We were seated near the far end of the restaurant. There were two 8 party tables next to us. The servers buzzed around their tables and passed by us. We had to continually ask for meats. I asked for lamb four times before it was brought to the table. I also had to ask for horseradish three times before it was brought.   If you look at my other reviews, I am generally easy to satisfy. I don't ask for special treatment, I don't expect servers to be at my beck and call. This meal was very substandard as far as service was concerned. I think next time....yes I will go again as I have had great experiences here.... I will ask to be seated more towards the center of the dining room. I will NOT do the restaurant special. I'll pay the extra to be treated like a regular patron. It wasn't worth being ignored for the small savings.",

What I love about Fogo is the service and variety. Something that was off this evening.   What was right was the amazing \"marketplace\".  The salad bar has a beautiful selection of salads, roasted veggies, cheeses and more!   What was also right is their Tres Leches cake for dessert.   What was missing was the service. Typically, the challenge is that there are so many meat offerings that you have to put out the red card to wave the servers away. However tonight there were times where we waited 10 minutes between offerings.  We asked staff members for help, and although nice, we still waited far too long between service.  We had to ask for clean plates where normally they were offered - what was normally a smooth operation was clearly off tonight. We watched servers move sound the room but completely ignore our table!    I still love their restaurant, but was disappointed tonight. Let's hope this was a fluke and they quickly return to stellar service.",

During the course of this hour and half this man consumed two bottles of champagne. The whole time he was loudly cursing stating \"bitches ain't shit\" he even went on to insult one of their own staff telling the waitor to \"get to stepping you four eyed ni**a\". At times the staff chuckled because this man was that deliberately drunk and apologized at least 4 times to my friend and I because they knew his behavior was inappropriate. When I asked if this customer was a regular (bc I couldn't figure out why he wasn't kicked out already) the waitor replied \"no I think he has autism\". When In fact he was too drunk after being on his second bottle of champagne. At one point he purposely broke his Champagne glass by throwing it on the table and all they did was pick up the glass while letting him continue to drink straight from the bottle. He was falling in and out of sleep at his table as well and was still allowed to stay. It wasn't until he got up and poured champagne all over a man's head and then proceeded to pour champagne on myself that they finally escorted him out. Shame on you for not taking control of the situation sooner all because this man was clearly spending a lot of money. What did you think would happen after you served him all that liquor? When I made a statement that I thought it was bs to serve him that much liquor after he was visibly, belligerently drunk the manager stated they diluted the second bottle with water but my clothes and hair definitely don't smell like it. This man was outside the front puking his brains out. Straight liquid from all the liquor they allowed him to consume. Be more responsible. Know when to say enough is enough to ppl especially when they are in that state.",

Ambiance was nice we got seated right away we had no reservation the waitress was nice told us about the menu and what they served we went to the salad bar we all were pleased. A waiter was mixing drinks on a cart my friend ordered one it was good. We had our plates replaced then the meat started coming we were a little overwhelmed because we couldn't finish one without someone else coming with more meat in less then 5 minutes my plate was full of meat and couldn't tell what most of it was. If you decide to spend $55 on the experience I recommend flipping your card and finishing each coarse. I asked my wife and my 2 friends that came with what percentage would they say they liked of all the items we tried it was 50%.. my disappointment was the rush of trying to have everything hot and our waitress came by and said we had to try some of their sauce which her timing was late already seeing we had tried most and where getting full. She never came back until we where done our plates where never changed out put once after salad bar and our water was out for over an hour. We expressed our dissatisfaction and she tried to give us every desert they had. My first impression for all of us was well we dont need to ever go their again $255 a full belly but it wasn't very enjoyable experience.",

The entire staff was great, and they worked so well as a team. I wish I could remember all their names so I could give everyone a shout out. My mom mentioned she liked lamb, it appeared almost immediately. I asked about the beef rib, someone brought some for the table. My dad's pen wasn't working, a server overheard and handed him one. It was almost magical. I've been there for dinner before, and the price is tough to justify, but the lunch was 2/3 the price and 100% of the experience. I would recommend going for dinner for a really special occasion, but if you ask me, lunch is worth it any day! All the stars!",

The food was good, especially the Picanha but NOT worth the price tag. The atmosphere leaves everything to be desired. They were passing out 4oz cocktails...later found out they carried a premium price. Usually when you pay $60 a plate for food the setting is more romantic and the wait staff doesn't spill cocktails on you.",

Service: was seated at the back of the restaurant for a party of 8. took 15 min before we had to flag a server down to explain how we're suppose to start eating and took our drink orders. this really pissed me off, but after we got their attention, everything caught up to speed and we went and got our salads and the meats started coming around fast.  Food: the bread they give you is so so soo delicious, warm, soft, and sweet. their salad bar has a good selection of veggies as cheeses and other yummy sides. the meats were so tender and juicy and very flavorful. I wasn't too big of a fan of the chicken cuts, but the prime rib, lamb, house sirloin, and garlic beef were amazing. if you love meat, this is definitely a place for you. we were there to celebrate two birthdays and the server was very generous and allowed the two birthday girls to pick any dessert on the house AND allowed the other 6 people in the party choose between three different types of dessert, so everyone got a slice of cheesecake which was fluffy and delicious.",

Waiter also handed me the receipt to sign and walked off without even looking at me.  Not a good first impression.  The food was excellent, came quickly and tasted great.  The salad bar was also delicious with a large variety for my wife, who was not eating meat.  I will go back, but my service will hopefully improve.

In France, I had steak, in Japan, I had steak, on the border between Belize and Columbia, I've had steak, days before Arab spring's debut in Egypt, I had steak. Of course, the sense of adventure has always been a major factor in my favourite steaks, and this small town in Arizona doesn't have much to offer in the way of adventure, but they did have steak, so naturally I had steak. The steak here was so good that it surpassed every other steak I'd ever eaten, my tiny mind was vaporised the very instant the steak touched my taste buds, each aspect of the steak's decadent being danced on my tongue. The texture, the flavour, the juiciness, all kicked in with just the right amount of force. I was in heaven for a brief moment. This steak is a gift to mankind, and should be treated as such, a steak identical to this one should be displayed in a museum, monuments should be erected just to honour this very steak. I cannot begin to stress how amazing it was, and what your witnessing is just a tiny portion of my emotions toward this steak. Otherwise the service was good, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I would marry that steak if I could. That is all. -Merrick.",

    "text": "We came here for my birthday and I've got to say, we were a bit disappointed. I'm surprised by the high ratings. It's not that it was bad but it wasn't great either. The staff was friendly for the most part except for the first guy who came to offer meat. I had never been here and didn't know the tiny fork to my right was to hold the meat while he cut. So the first guy cut the meat and let it fall onto my plate and it almost hit my chest and my white top so that was a surprise. After the meat fell to the plate he told me to use the little fork next time....Mm-k-thanks. A lot of the meats were actually very dry and tasteless, only a couple were moist and flavorful. We loved the side dishes they brought by though, those were delicious. I couldn't get enough of the plantains. Their salad bar was pretty decent but there could have been more options. They were supposed to bring out a happy birthday dessert but no one ever showed up with it and my boyfriend wanted it to be a surprise so he didn't want to have to remind someone in front of me. We didn't want to be late to the comedy club so we left without getting it. Service was quite slow too, especially when we were done and needed to pay. We were on a time crunch so it got a little frustrating. Overall this place was ok but for the price you pay I would expect all the meats to be moist and full of flavor. I love the concept and it's a really fun idea but for that price I don't know that we'd be back. Maybe if we found a discount or coupon somewhere.",

    "text": "This started as a 3 paragraph review of the restaurant, but I wanted to just review what our experience was for the night we went. We went on Valentines day and it was very crowded. There was a line out the door and down the sidewalk for everyone, reservations or not. I verified that they were accepting walk-ins and indeed they were. Had there not been a line for people with reservations, I don't think this would have been a big deal.  The salad bar, gauchos, and meats were amazing, but the level of service and execution for this nights event left a lot to be desired. With 2 full meal services and 8 drinks, the total with tip came out to about $240. At $11-12 a drink, and having only seen our waiter 3 times over the 2 hours we were there, this was grossly disproportionate in expectation.   Fogo had sent out a promotional email on the 8th offering a meal comp for making reservations for Valentines (14th-16th). In retrospect I should have avoided this window of opportunity and went any other time. Our prior visit to Fogo was exceptional, without question. But between the reservations line, poor landscaping in front of the building, being crammed in like sardines, the screaming kids, and the diner behind our table coughing on one of the Gauchos meat skewers, this was just extra icing on a less than stellar cake.   I wanted this to be at least a 3 if not 4 star review, but service and execution really made this a let down, experience wise. With that, I'm right back to where I started an hour ago. Still 3 paragraphs.",

    "text": "Being married to a meat and potatoes kinda guy, I thought booking dinner for Valentine's Day at Fogo de Chao would be a huge treat.  It turned out to be a huge disappointment.  We went last night and will never go back.  We were seated promptly, way in a back corner...about as far from the salad bar as you can get.  This place is packed with tables.  You literally have to stand and wait as servers and other customers weave through the tables.  I found it strange that staff didn't let customers pass first - they blew by customers as if we didn't exist.    We were seated and got the lowdown on how it all worked.  We were excited to be there and dig into the amazing salad bar and try the different meat choices.  Our trip to the salad bar was chaotic.  The line was going every which way and people were reaching over each other to get to the different selections. Everything on the salad bar was fresh, the presentation was nice but what a hassle!  We were given some rolls which were odd.  Soft, undercooked dough filled with some sort of cheese.  I can eat some bread, but the texture of this stuff was just not right.  The meat...honestly, I'm not much of a carnivore, but even my husband was far from impressed.  All of it was dry and so salty that we were reaching for our water glasses constantly.  The service was what was really odd.  The skewer guys would show up in our section in such a rush that they missed our table (and others) most of the time.  You have to wave them down or ask passing busboys to get service.  By the time the pork ribs and rib eye came around (after my husband spoke to our server about the lack of service) all of the sides were cold and we were just over it and full from the massive amount of water we had to drink.  We are not tough to please people.  We don't do pricey restaurants often and were really looking forward to having a fun experience at Fogo.  I regret booking our Valentines dinner at this strange, silly place.  Should have gone with my first instinct and headed to Durant's for  tried and True great food and perfect service.  Live and learn.",

What wasn't nice was having full glasses spilled down my husband's back.  While he was being his usual polite self, unlike most of the Scottsdale clientele usually would be, that doesn't mean that it was actually okay.    Had he NOT had things spilled on him, I would have been able to rate the service as impeccable as the food, though the Nouveau riche clientele were generally rude (yea I'm talking to you guy who tried to just jump in front of us at the hostess stand, AND the girl who couldn't WAIT to get at that asparagus - which was HUGE and delicious).  Unfortunately, while the staff and managers were all apologetic and asked if we were okay, that was all that happened.    We've never had drinks spilled on us at Fogo E Brasa, and the atmosphere is much more friendly. Their fashion of letting the staff know you would like more (or no) meat at any one time is much easier on the staff.  While the food is excellent, and most of the service good, I was disappointed there wasn't more done for a table that was having their first experience and got to deal with enough drink to require a mop and new chair. We also had several times when our cards were green and the staff wandered around us, without stopping by. We didn't get a chance to try everything.  So, I guess we're sticking with Fogo E Brasa. (Which is I guess now Brazilian Bull)  UPDATE: even after posting here and to their Facebook page, it's obvious they don't care.  Rodizio Grill ftw.",

I explained I thought the service was excellent as was the wine but it didn't taste as good as meals id had before. He was awesome, he probably in that moment raised what would have been a 3 to a 5 star. I wish I had guys like him working for my company and it seemed the entire staff there was on point.

Their salad bar is spectacular. It's not your run of the mill salad bar. They have specialty salads, grilled vegetables, soups, Italian meats and cheeses, etc. You can actually go and only order the salad bar for half price. I'll likely opt to do this next time. The reason I say that is because I went pregnant and getting a well done piece of meat out of these guys is not easy. I totally understand that beef is MUCH better served medium or so, but ladies don't have that option when they're pregnant. That's the only reason I knocked a star off for them. They kept telling me they would bring me well-done cuts, but I only got one out of about 5. They do come around with chicken, pork, etc, but I was most interested in the beef. Will we be back? Of course. It's not a place we will visit often, but it's a fun experience.",

The inside is very spacious and is pretty good for group celebrations of a romantic dinner. There is a bar area to the side that seems pretty quiet and cozy for those intimate dinners.  They have quite a lot of wine in their selection. Walking in, you can see their wine gallery.   What can I say about their food. It is delicious. There is a lot of it. There is also a salad bar and it's pretty good but let's be honest here...you didn't come here for salad. I ate a lot of the filet mignon. It was good. There was lamb, delicious. I don't think I can say anything bad about this place at all. The service was fast.  The pricing...well, you're in a brazillian steak house in Scottsdale so, yeah.   I would come back here again but I wouldn't make it a usual stop. I could get a coronary with all the yellow gold flowing through my veins already.",

    "text": "We've been going to Fogo for several years now. We loved this place. Celebrated almost every anniversary, birthday, special occasion and often went just for the heck of it. It was our favorite place to eat.  We did notice a change recently.  We came about 2 months ago for lunch, they were hosting a rather large office gathering in the back room. Other than the party, there were only 3 tables occupied with guests at the time.  Normally, we are greeted by the same lady at the counter, who would ask if we had a reservation, and then seat us. Waiters would usually be bustling all around, putting the side items on the table, offering plates, asking about drinks.  The service was very lacking. We waited 10 min before someone came and took our drink order. We got our own plates. T here were almost no meat servers.  We were offered chicken legs and sausage several times, but did not see any of the beef selections. We eventually asked a passing waiter if we could have someone bring some specific meats.  Several minutes later a man came out with some rib-eye, and offered it to us. We gratefully took it, as that is what we came here to eat.  It was a disappointment. It was very over-cooked and mushed apart.  Another came behind him offering pork ribs.  We took some of the ribs, they were so dry they were almost crunchy, inedible.  We finally took a portion of some sirloin and that was decent enough.   We also noticed they changed some things about the salad bar area. They had removed the big cheese wheel and cheese/meats from the end area and moved the cured meats over to the side, we did not see any cheeses except for the mozzarella. They also did not have the bacon curls, roasted garlic, green olives and a couple other items. I was a bit disappointed, since those were my favorite tidbits to grab. They also changed the recipe of some items, like the potato salad. The new recipe is just not the same. No one ever came and refilled our drinks or gave us clean plates.  We ended up leaving early, sadly disappointed.   Today, we happened to be on the east side of town and decided to go to Fogo again.  We left much quicker this time, probably 30 min or less after arriving.  They have completely changed the 'business model'.  The menu changed, offering the 'full experience' or an ala carte type pick and choose. They increased the price and sadly the service was almost worse than the last time.   It appears they have drastically changed the wait staff as well.  I didn't get ice in my water, when I asked to have some ice, the person looked confused and walked off, never got the ice. I usually get the Guarana soda as well, one of the waiters tried to pour iced tea it it. Then another server took the can off the table, tried pouring the rest of the can in the already filled glass and left with the can still having some of the drink left in it, without explanation or permission to touch my drink.  We noticed also that the meat servers purposely brought meats out very slowly and waiting several minutes in between bringing out the meat choices, which, drove people to go to the lesser expensive salad bar. Obviously more cost effective for Fogo. But not what people come there to eat.  The side dishes that came with the meal are now served in little plastic black bowls and less of it.  We sat and watched as server after server walked by us and never once offered meats, they would head to one specific table, then go in the back. They would not come back out for many minutes and always to a specific table. We again had to stop several waiters and ask to have meat brought to us.  Now, it's not unusual to ask a server for a specific meat you like, but to feel like you have to ask just to be served is not good.  My husband was so disappointed that he said he was done and just wanted to leave. He only ended up with having 2 meats served to him, beef ribs and ribeye.  We waited almost 20 min for someone to bring out the Picanha, which is my favorite. We left right after that.   We likely will not be going back.   Such a disappointment too. We loved this place and have so many good memories. The first time we went several years ago on our anniversary, they gave us the mud pie for free and congratulated us. And it was a wonderful experience every time we went, until now.  We hope it gets better, because we truly did love going there. Really disappointing.",

Last night, I took her and her parents out to dinner here to celebrate her birthday.  Needless to say, this place did not disappoint in the least.  If I had anything to complain about, it didn't have anything to do with the restaurant, staff, food or experience.  It had to do with the fact that their meats were so good that I kept wanting more and more to the point where I should've stopped eating 20-30 minutes previous to when I actually did.  My favorites were the Garlic Filet Mignon, Parmesean crusted pork and the Linguisa.  The polenta was cooked to perfection and loved the caramelized bananas they delivered as side dishes.  Everyone got a dessert and loved it.  Since we were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday, they decorated the plate with her dessert with \"Happy Birthday\".  This is definitely on our list of special occasion dinner restaurants along with some others.  Will definitely go back again.",

You turn a card over to green when you want meat and these guys come by and slice a little, tiny sliver of all kinds of meat. I tried the parmesan pork, bacon wrapped filet, sirloin, pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken and lamb. There's a great salad bar you can go to that has a ton of things on it as well. They bring out a side of mashed potatoes but ours were cold. There were bananas in a cinnamon type sauce, rolls and a cornbread type of thing as well. There were 14 of us and 1 guy (Christopher) told the other side of the table what the deal was but he didnt come to our side so we were just unaware of how things worked. Adam was basically our server and was super efficient and fun. It was my moms 70th bday and he brought her cheesecake and it was delicious. My sister was at the other end of the table and a guy came by and said he was the customer service manager and asked how everything was. She told him that our table was totally out of sync. While we were on dessert, they were just getting some meat so he comped 2 desserts and that was nice. There were so many people constantly at our table, which is great except that there wasn't anyone in control of the table so when my niece asked for more rolls, someone said yes and never came back. That type of thing happened a lot.  Overall, the food was good and our server Adam was cool but the table as a whole had completely different experiences.",

We were greeted quickly, and our two guests had the \"how it works\" info presented... when we saw a slight break in the masses, we began at the salad bar. While I don't like the serve yourself experience, it is a great starter/first course buffet, with interesting selections. HOWEVER... bring your pads and helmets!! The masses attack!!!  Within seconds, the waaaaay too many tables of hungry customers attack the line... pushing, invading your space, reaching in front of you to get their asparagus, dressing, etc. It's NOT a pleasant experience, ESPECIALLY, when you're paying high dollars for a dining experience!  The customer etiquette is not the restaurant's fault; however, packing too many people in... IS!!  They are putting their short term profits in front of their customer's experience!  It's NOT going to work... for the longterm!  In addition, the server's rushing and bumbling pace was stressful and exhausting! Again, they were all rushing around to try to meet the needs of the waaaaaay too many tables crammed into the space.  After our First course, we flipped the coaster to GO. Other visits, the many server/chefs come to carve off some delectable meats. This time, we have only 3 or 4 visit our table... the meats were great, but where was the chicken, the prime rib, the sirloin, the lamb.. It wasn't until later we realized we hadn't had many selections.  After we had finished... we waited....and waited... and waited for a simple \"how was your meal?\" Or... \"would you care for any desert?\" Or... a \"can I get you anything else?\" or even an acknowledgement that we even existed!   I finally stopped a \"blue shirt\" (manager wannabe?) rushing by... told him that we were feeling ignored and that \"no one would talk to us\".  His response: \"I'll talk to you... What do you want to talk about... The weather?\"  Normally I would have kicked his ass with this smart assed remark; however, it took me by surprise! I was stunned, embarrassed  and speechless! Our guests asked for coffee and he ran off... never to be seen again. Coffee showed by someone else and we asked for our bill and left.  Again... Food excellent... Atmosphere is LOUD and CRAMPED... Service sucks and the \"blue shirt\", manager wannabe, needs his ass kicked!   NOT going back and recommend that you don't until they start putting their customer's experience in front of their rush - rush, pack  'em in and move 'em out\" attitude.",

    "text": "WOW! Rule #1: come hungry.  Actually....come starving.  You may want to avoid eating at all before coming to this place.  So much food....so much food.   You walk in and you just see the wait staff running around at lightining speed getting the food and drinks to their respective table.  When they disperse, they open up a path to this magical salad bar with some really great cheeses, veggies, and some type of raw fish (similar to sushi or maybe it was), but it was really good.    HOW IT WORKS: Salad Bar, Meats, Dessert (service continued or halted by red or green indicator that you have on your table)   You sit down with a \"button\" that is similar to a circular cup coaster.  One side is red and the other green.  You want that button to be on green when you sit down.   That will trigger wait staff to come by and bring you A TON of different meat varieties.    They brought out lamb, different types of steaks in different seasonings, and ask you if you have any special meat requests if you want to try something in particular or want  another sample of something you've already had.   They bring it on a stick and carve off the section you want depending on how you want the meat cooked.   Along with that, they will be bringing out bread rolls with CHEESE in them! HOLY WOW!  of course - they have the garlic mashed potatoes on standby.      The DESSERT was nice!  a Chocolate Mousse cake that I barely had room for.     EXPECT the meal to START at $50 but I would go in ready for a lot more than that due to drinks that you may want to get, people with you, etc.     Fellas...If your girl has been good to you - treat her to a nice dinner.  She deserves it. Vice versa too, please.  Hunger is not prejudice.",

As we are enjoying salad, someone brings us artichoke spinach dip- my thought? I never received a menu to order that in the first place.  We wanted rare cuts of meat that never delivered.  We had a pregnant woman that was unable to eat their offered items and was rudely \"forced\" to order because she would be charged regardless, really?!? Awesome hospitality.  Drinks were forgotten and at the end of the day I would not recommend this place for a night out. Super disappointing because it could be so cool.  Service is disorganized and dissatisfying.

It was the first time for all of us and I swear we had the \"deer in headlights\" look on our faces.  We were given instruction by our first waiter that the staff works as a team and are not assigned to specific tables.  However, he was a bit stiff and when we asked him a question, he responded with \"as I said before....\" Needless to say, we didn't call him back to help us.  We were fortunate to flag down Junior!  Wow!  So personable and quick with requests!  He made sure we had everything we needed.  It seems like we weren't the only ones Junior made an impression on because other tables kept calling him over!  LOL    The food was so perfectly done no matter what our preference was (rare, medium well, well done...).  The salad bar was so abundant.  We had to be careful not to fill up before we had our actual dinner.  We lucked out that they were having their Summer Special which was $45 per person and included dessert (try their Tres Leches cake!) Sides were also good and you can ask for more.    Even though you had to roll us out of there...  ;-) We will ALL definitely be coming back and we will definitely be asking for Junior!  He made the experience that much more memorable.",

Fogo de Chao is like a buffet that comes to you.  For about $50, servers on carts move about the restaurant and will serve you a cut of whatever they are carrying.  It's not the best or most seasoned cuts you will ever consume, but you will not leave dissatisfied or hungry.  There is also a pretty big \"salad bar\" that will get some greens and starches on your plate, but it's really not all that great.  Fogo also caters well to bigger groups.  My party of 15 had no problem being promptly seated (with some arriving well before our reservation) and served.  I highly recommend dining at Fogo with a group of carnivores when you have something to celebrate.",

    "text": "Made reservations for dinner Friday night through open table at 8pm. Arrived at restaurant and it was very busy. I advised that we had a reservation at 8pm and they told me they were seating 7 thirties so it would be a bit of a wait. We only waited 15 minutes then were seated. Restaurant was nice and elegant. Many people were dressed up in fine attire and some in shorts and sandals. The salad bar was impressive as it had many delicious choices. The bar with the side orders was empty almost the entire time. I only tasted a few of the roasted potatoes and the white rice. No beans, no scalloped potatoes ect. A little dissapointed in this. The meats however were outstanding quality. I really like the fact that they ask you how you want your meat and give you your desired cut. Every meat I tasted was juicy , flavorful and just plain amazing.  The only meat I did not like was the Linguica. The price was pricey at $50 per person but well worth the service and quality of food. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Another excellent Fogo de Chao experience, every bit as good as meals enjoyed in the the Austin and Chicago outposts.  I will say, though, that the Scottsdale edition might be the nicest looking restaurant of the Fogos I've seen.  As usual, the Picanha (the signature cut) was outstanding.  However, what really caught my attention this time was the Fraldinha, or lower sirloin.  I do not recall this being so good in previous visits, but it was juicy, tender and intensely flavorful.  Of the two fillet mignon offered, the standard (non bacon wrapped) was the best.  Perfectly medium rare, with a beautifully buttery texture.  Sadly, the bacon wrapped version was too overdone.  Although sometimes it's nice to break up the beef parade with some chicken, I am always disappointed.  The lamb and pork ribs, however, are good alternatives.  The salad bar is fresh and abundant, but don't fill up on too many items here.  What's always impressive to me is the huge wheel of authentic Parmesan Reggiano and it's hard not to carve off a few chunks of rich, salty cheese.    Side dishes are typical: mashed potatoes (which are light and airy), fried polenta squares and caramelized bananas.  The latter are particularly nice to give your taste buds a break from the meat onslaught, with the sweetness playing a nice counterpoint to rich and salty beef.  As usual, I will need at least 6 months to recover from this experience.  But, I'll be back.  Just not sure what city it'll be in.",

    "text": "Treated my friend here yesterday for a birthday lunch. The salad bar was great, the cuts of meat were mostly amazing, and for most of it, the service wasn't too shabby either.   In my opinion the lamb t-bone, small chicken legs, and bacon wrapped filets were the best of the meat they brought around. Other cuts ranged from \"great\" to \"dry\". And boy did they bring around they meats. I was a little worried that going there for late lunch they'd have a limited selection, or stuff wouldn't be as hot & fresh, but that's not something you should worry about.   The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review was the service at the end. The check never came, and we had to flag someone down - which by itself is a passable offense - but also, I made a special comment when booking online that I was taking my friend out for his birthday and they never made any mention of it, which was extremely disappointing. I even saw a sticky note when we were being seated that said, \"note: BDAY!\"  I don't know if either of us could have handled dessert had they offered, but they could have offered him a drink on the house or something. Or at least said \"enjoy your birthday.\"  Loved the meal, was sad for it to end on a disappointing note.",

First you take a trip to a salad bar.. oh no no my friend, do not turn your nose up at this \"salad bar\"... they have freshly made mozzerella, smoked salmon, asparagus... the salad bar is amazing. After you have your fill of the delicious mozerella and ripe tomatoes... the meat feast begins! Guys walk briskly around the restaurant with giant swords of meat.. yes... GIANT SWORDS OF MEAT. If they see your card is on green, they slice you off a big ole chunk of whatever meat you would like. I suggest the lamb, it is amazing.. every piece of meat i tried there was mouth watering and cooked to perfection. I have never been so full my entire life... This is a great place to celebrate your anniversary, or take that special someone out.",

Driving from Goodyear is a challenge since construction of I10 (which we try to avoid during the weekends) with closures of lanes take place. However, we bit the bullet and decided to make our drive because of what we anticipated would be a wonderful meal. Again, they did not disappoint us. We have had great servers in the past and recognized several of them throughout the years. This visit was an absolutely marvelous.  Our server Karina has to be one of the best employees they have. She has one of the most beautiful smiles and is right there to take care of your every need.  The food has always been stupendous, however, when you have a server that is one of the best in every way it only adds to your whole experience of a wonderful meal. We simply cannot say enough about the quality of their food and their servers.  It was also nice to see the general manager walk throughout the restaurant several times just to make certain all customers were happy customers. It was a memorable day and we look forward to visit them again and again.",

We went in knowing what to expect and really didn't get the experience we were hoping for. Especially when it's automatically a $100+ dinner just for 2 people. To begin with, the host seemed rather grumpy. Not exactly setting the mood for a romantic expensive dinner. Our server greeted us when we sat and then disappeared for the remaining hour we were there. I'm not sure if they switched server sections and therefore we got a new server or what, but we had about 4 other servers or helpers stop by to get us water refills or just to randomly check on us. But never our actual server although we saw him roaming the room at other tables. We got the full Brazilian experience and still had to request the prime meats to be brought out to us. The mash potatoes were great but I felt the meats to be either super rare or too well done even though we always requested Medium Rare. They still weren't bad but a little bland compared to other Brazilian steakhouses we've been to in the past.  The check was ridiculous though. We were asked if we were ready the check and it took them 10 minutes to even bring it to us after requesting it (I actually timed it because I was frustrated at this point just waiting for them to even ask us about the check). After I gave them my card, it took ANOTHER 5 minutes before I got it back. Absolutely uncalled for just to process a check. Overall, very unhappy and dissatisfied. But judging by other reviews, apparently this isn't new behavior for this particular location which is quite sad. For this much money, we deserved better.",

Let's be positive here first.   The ambience is great, white table cloth, clean environment, everything is looking high end, great, done, woohoo.  We get to the \"salad\" bar. Nothing wrong here, I liked the assortment of cheeses, salads, little sides like olives and the other charcuterie type items were great. My brother told me not to get too much of the salad bar items, I know why. These are just fillers for the real meat. They also bring mashed potatoes and fried plantains (that were terrible).   So my buddy orders a Diet Coke and it's in a glass bottle. Ok cool. Get to that later.  So we get to the \"17 different\" meats. Now if you are vegan, obviously you will not want to go here. So I'm not vegan and we continue to eat. We get the first couple meats and I'm like ok this is pretty good. Different style with the whole skewer type serving. Then we get to some of the other meats like the garlic steak and bacon wrapped chicken/steak and a few others that were absolutely awful. The garlic steak tasted like a fishy taste and I almost threw up in my mouth. It almost ruined my whole meal. The others that I don't even remember were so dry and almost flavorless I was in shock. I asked for most of the cuts with the crust on it to get some flavor and still not exciting. I mean I tried 5-7 different meats and only had one bite of each. I even talked to my brother and he went to one in another state and it was the same issue. Dry, not great flavor, not juicy, and just overall not good experiences. He even told me he didn't want to tell me so I didn't get disappointed, but I did. The best meat was the lamb. The porks were bad and the chicken was dry big time and a few steak items.   The diet cokes. Ok, so our lunch for 2 ppl with no booze was $85 and some of that is because they charged us for 2 cokes because they are in bottles not from the machine. Don't you think you are making enough for mediocre steak that you don't have to charge for each Coke and then ask if we want a refill 20 times in 3 min?? Makes no sense.   Honestly I just don't think it's worth the price and not that great of a product. Probably won't be back, even though I left with a food baby in me.",

    "text": "Went with friends with high hopes of great meal & atmosphere...severely disappointed!! Let's see where to start.. first off, it's like a big cafeteria, no significant atmosphere to the place. Our unfriendly server, with a heavy accent and who never so much as cracked a tiny smile,  pretty much told us that if we wanted the \"full experience\", we should order the $57 p/p meat extravaganza.  When my friend ordered the salad bar ($29), our server was clearly displeased and even said \"so you 'just' want that?\" ( ... well, it's on the menu, so yes...)  My husband and our other friend ordered the chilean bass ($40+ ea) and I was the only one to order the \"full experience\" to which she immediately looked at us and said \"and to let you know, sharing the meat is NOT allowed\".. looking at each one of us.  Excuse me? If I take a bite of sea bass from my husband's plate, he can certainly take a bite of my plate.  The gauchos took forever to get to our table and even though I had my card turned green, our table was passed up time & time again.I was promised a wide variety of meats and only saw the same 4-5 cuts go by.  No way did they deliver on this \"full experience\". Our server stopped at our table once the entire night and I had to finally hand my dirty plate to a staff member who was just walking by!  Twice I had to flag someone down for water...twice! Finally my husband just got up to get the water pitcher himself; at which time, 4 staff members descended on him.  Then came time to pay our bill, credit cards where handed over and when it was time to sign, I promise you.. this guy stood over my friend's shoulder; looked like a mob hitman and just said \"Mr. ____?\" I thought someone's card had been declined.  He handed the bills over without a word. We unhappily signed the cards and as we were leaving, we used the restroom.  There was toilet paper all over the floors of the stalls, no seat covers, garbage can overflowing and an old worn out, torn leather chair in the corner! yuck! I took pictures but can't find how to post them! Seriously, we dropped $212 and wished we could take it back. The food was good but the service was so awful; it spoiled it for us.  No one was helpful, no one smiled at you and no one said Thank you.  I am still in shock.  Think twice before going here!",

    "text": "We ate here along with a large group. It was my first time at Fogo, though I have heard many great things about it. I LOVED the salad bar. I could have happily eaten from there alone--the fresh mozzarella was divine. However, the meat is the highlight of this place, and quite an impressive one. Wayfaring servers with meat on swords--what's not to like? My favorites included the filet mignon with bacon, parmesan pork, and lamb.   Of the sides on the table, I really liked the Pao de Queijo cheese rolls--like big, soft bubbles! The mashed potatoes just tasted like mashed potatoes and the bananas just weren't my sort of thing.  While the meat service was constant, the regular table service was lacking. My section in the middle of the table was almost entirely ignored. I only acquired a drink because my husband directed a server my way; I only had one water refill the whole time, and my finished plate awaited pick up for about 30 minutes. People seated around me gave up and walked to the bar to get drinks.   The dessert offerings that night were chocolate mousse cake, cheesecake, and tres leches. My husband chose the mousse cake, and I thought he made the right call; I had the tres leches, which tasted bland to me. All of the dessert slices were pretty small, which is probably wise considering the meat smorgasbord.   My husband adored the place. The service issues were frustrating for me, but overall I liked it. If you're a carnivore, it's the place to go.",

He ran away like if nothing happened 3- the waiter dropped the bill, he did not pick it up  4- there was additional item on the bill, the waiter waited to see if I will check, then he said ooh sir , I am not sure, but did you order this item?  I go to this place just for the experience, if the experience is not good any more what else I will for.

The garlic beef & lamb were my favorite. Don't get dolled up to go, everyone was dressed pretty casual. The service however was great. We had the same waiter the entire time & we stayed around 2 hours. I think this place is more about the experience. You have to try it at least once. I ordered the tres leches cake to go & it was way too sweet, something I never say. The polenta fries were awesome & the fried bananas tasted like old overripe bananas repurposed. If I ever go back I'll probably just order from the bar menu, but that's only if I'm in the area.",

Even though our special didn't include rib eye and lamb, it didn't seem like we were missing out on anything. Service was very good. Salad bar was excellent. Restaurant was clean. Now the bad -  the cocktails we ordered were probably the most watered-down drinks we've ever experienced. And at $16 each, one would expect an undiluted mix.  The top sirloin, which is the best cut in the special, was pretty tough to locate after a certain hour. We even asked for it. Twice. FdC has and electronic point-of-sale payment system used at your table. The default tip is 20%, which is at the high end of the range, especially for a quasi-buffet style restaurant.  True, one can edit the tip to whatever level you want. But who wants to look like a cheapskate knocking down the tip to 18%?  We paid the 20%, but the FdC approach is offensive. Even with the $39 special, dinner for 4 with a modest bottle of wine came to $350 all in. On balance, a good experience, but not a good value.",

    "text": "Ah, Fogo de chao... you never disappoint! I've been to several of your locations across the county and tried the (only!) AZ location last night, for my delight.  Compared to other Fogo locations , this location is small and tables feel a bit cramped on top of each other. This is NOT a place for a dim-light, low-noise, romantic date. This place is bright, full, lively and full of that awesome Brazilian energy. We are loud people anyways.  Skip the buffet. Maybe pick a leaf or two of lettuce, but focus on what matters the most, which is the amazing variety and quality of meat. The meat is GOOD. If you are planning on going to a regular steakhouse and pay $50 for a cut of filet, better go to Fogo and pay $55 to try all cuts of steak you want! Medium rare top sirloin (picanha) and garlic sirloin and the bomb, btw. You will be happy and you will be full.  You will be interrupted a million times because the meat keeps coming. And keep coming. And there's always someone checking on you, so expect to be interrupted mid-sentence a bazillion times. It is what it is. The customer service in this location is top notch. I felt like everyone was checking on us through the night to make sure we had everything we need. I felt very well taken care.  As a Brazilian, it was also very refreshing to speak in Portuguese with so many super friendly servers and service staff. Our server was Karina and she was an angel through the night, excellent service, personable, amazing. The managers or maitre (not sure the labels there) were also amazing and attentive. And then we also had the caipirinha artist, Vince. Vince made us tableside caipirinhas that were probably the best I've had. And I've had a few in my life. Caipirinha was so good and well made I forgot to eat after my first sip. I just wanted to drink lol  Don't skip the pao de queijo, I've had at least 8. That's what I eat when I go to Fogo: pao de queijo, caipirinha and steak. What else do you need?  With that exceptional service and amazing quality, this is the place to go. And I'll definitely go back!",

    "text": "DO NOT dine here alone.  That's my biggest and most important disclaimer if you plan on making your way to gorge yourself at Fogo de Chao.  Bring a date, heck bring the whole family, but don't do as I did and come alone.  There's simply too much.  Too much of everything.  Too quickly.  And too much variety of everything that it'll have you and your stomach begging for mercy as mine did.  Now then, hopefully I've drilled that critical piece of advice into your skull.  So let's talk about my visit here.  Fogo de Chao is (I think as of this writing) now the last Brazilian specific restaurant in the Phoenix area now that north Scottsdale's Carvalho's has shuttered.  Headquartered in Dallas with 50 locations nationwide, Fogo's only Arizona location lies along the west side of Scottsdale Road just a block south of Lincoln Drive.  I've seen Churrascarias (Brazilian steakhouses) featured on television shows, via online ads and of course from several reviews of this place.  But the price point had kept me at bay from here for a time.  But on a Saturday at lunch I figured I'd waited long enough.  So I came right at their 11:30am opening.  Good thing I did as this more than 200 seat behemoth was jampacked by 1pm.  The menu here such as it is, is pretty simple.  You tell your host which of the four different meal options you want.  You can get the market table (effectively the salad and sides bar) by itself.  Or you can get the market table with sea bass, salmon, or the endless meat Churrasco experience.  And really, if you're coming here for anything other than the full Churrasco experience you're doing it wrong.  Its discounted quite a bit at lunch too (lucky me).  Before I dove headfirst into the meat and market table, I first started with Fogo's signature Premium Caipirinha.  Cachaca, limes, and cane sugar mixed with ice.  I love me some caipirinhas and Fogo's is a good one, though they might've been a bit liberal with the ice.  Now to the food.  There's some like 50 items at the market bar including salads, fruits, veggies, soups, stews, meats, cheeses, sweets, and on and on.  Knowing that I had a whole bunch of meat coming my way, I pretty much knew I'd only get one shot at the market bar.  So I loaded up my plate with as much of each as I reasonably could.  When I got back to my table, I saw both to my delight (and somewhat to my horror) that they had thrown in a complimentary limeade drink, sides of polenta with candied bananas, bread, and garlic mashed potatoes.  And this is before I even received a bite of meat!  I worked away at my market table portion before finally turning my table light green to send in the churrasqueiros.  And before long skewers full of deliciously cooked and seasoned meats arrived at my table with each churrasqueiro slicing each cut right on the spot.  In all I had 7 different cuts.  Ribeye, top sirloin, flank, pork loin, pork rib, lamb, and chicken.  After devouring a whole market table, a whole mess of meat, a bunch of sides and two drinks, I (somehow) had the great idea of ordering dessert.  Their papaya cream dessert sounded like the perfect way to cool my insides and offset some of the epic meat sweats that were already percolating within.  Basically its papayas blended with vanilla ice cream and topped with creme de cassis (a blackcurrants liqueur).  This actually helped to sooth my insides a little bit, but it nevertheless made me even more full and more destined for the fetal position than I already was.  Total cost for the Full Churrasco experience, Caipirinha, Papaya Cream dessert, plus the multitudes of freebies, tip and tax came to $95.  To be fair, I do think I got my money's worth in terms of the volume of food and drink I devoured.  However I don't expect the majority of humans would be able to handle this much food.  You either have to eat to excess like I did to get your money's worth or the price just becomes too excessive for a normal portioned meal.  The service I received was wonderful from the wait staff, the churrasquerios, and even the host staff.  And the restaurant atmospherics are great for a date, a work get together, or for a big family occasion (and I saw a little of all three today).  I'm glad I gave this place a try, but only those with deep pockets or a roomy stomach should dare to enter this monument to excess.",

The entire time we were there he was shouting racial slurs and cursing. Management was well aware if the situation, because they kept apologizing. However, they never got him to leave. At one point he broke a champagne glass. He was drinking a bottle of Dom Perignon from the bottle, so clearly management wanted to collect money from him. This guy was very intoxicated to the point that he fell asleep. Then out of no where he decided to dump his bottle on two of the customers. One of the customers was my friend. The guy was then escorted out and police were called after this.  Management clearly need to get their priorities straight. The way this situation was handled was very poor and really made me feel uncomfortable. Clearly money was the deciding factor in this situation.",

    "text": "First timer here at Fogo de Chao, however I went to a similar Brazilian steakhouse with the same concepts. My cousin, best friend and I came for my birthday. We had drinks beforehand and that kind of filled my stomach. Note to self: don't drink again before Fogo de Chao.   I was happy the reservations weren't filled up because Valentine's Day was the day after. I was even able to easily change our reservations for 30 mins after our original time since we were running behind from drinks.   It was my friends first time as well with no Brazilian steakhouse experience. We were both excited to see what's up with the hype. When arrived we were quickly seated and introduced to the restaurant  The salad bar has plenty of hors d'oeuvre selections ranging from mozzarella balls, crispy bacon pieces, asparagus, you name it.   THE MEATS: That's what this place is really all about. It's honestly like an all you can eat meat buffet! They have all different types of meats and they just keep comin around with meat skewers. They have a card (red side and green side) you flip the card to green side if you haven't had enough and want more and flip it to red if you need a break pretty much  My favorites were the filet mignon and ribeye. FIRE! P.S. are you given a free birthday dessert. I chose the strawberry creme which is actually just cream that is strawberry flavored. It's like slightly melted strawberry ice cream in a cup. I would probably just stick to getting the creme brulee or a cheesecake had I known. FYI",

Overall the place is clean and front desk was really friendly. Would come back again if they're not that busy.",

If you are a meat lover, I would suggest going here for their meat options is amazing! If you like being served meat at your table side, you'll enjoy this restaurant. Their price is oftely in the pricey end but then again it is in the heart of Scottsdale.  I have to commend their excellent service! I like going to restaurents when they greet you at the door, check-up on you, and make sure you are taken cared of.  When I came here, I ordered their sea bass which was excellent. They didn't have their seared salmon but the general manager was very nice to take a few percent off our tab for waiting 20 minutes for my order. Like I said they are very accomodating and they make sure they take care of you.",

    "text": "We decided step out of our normal date night outing routine for my husband's birthday and venture outside our 10 mile comfort bubble to Fogo de Chao for its \"experience dining\".  We had made a reservation for 6:45, walked right in and  were seated right away but a lot of people were waiting. Reservations definitely were the way to go, especially for a Saturday night. The entire restaurant was packed. The dining area was a constant flow of different meat skewers going from table to table and drinks carts and giant seafood appetizers making their way to tables. This is definitely a place you come hungry too.   Our waitress was really amazing and explained to us the way this whole thing worked. There was a coaster on our table; one side green and one side red. If you flip the coaster to green, the meat will come to you and if the coaster is red, they will pass you by. First though, she encouraged us to take our trip through the salad bar.   There were so many more things than salad to choose from. There were all kinds of fresh fruit (Star fruit, dragon fruit, pineapple) and vegetables (asparagus spears, artichokes, peppers), cheese and cured meats. Do not be concerned about not getting enough meat at this step in the process as it is literally at your beckon call at any time in the dining experience.   We took our plates back to our table and additional food had arrived of cheese bread, mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas. We were having a rare night out without our kids but these tables sides would have been a big hit for the kids.   Then it was go time...literally.  We flipped the coaster. Green, open for business.   Here is where I cannot stress this enough.....pace yourself!   Admittedly, I made a critical rookie error and failed to understand that even though the meat came, you didn't have to take it and before I knew it, I was elbows deep in amazing tasting bottom sirloin, sensational Parmesan pork, mouthwatering bacon wrapped filets and more.   I tapped out and flipped to red.   After I made my way through my body weight in steak, I had to take a breather. I drank some water, enjoyed some of the fruit from the salad bar and the bananas at our table while trying to give myself a meat pep talk to get back in the game.   I never did.   I rallied for a few bites of the tres leches cake we got for my husbands birthday (tip: join the email club ahead of time for coupons), went home, and went into a certified delicious food coma.  Will I go again? Possibly assuming I have a better entry strategy. The food was all so incredible and although I felt like I was 50 lbs heavier leaving, I didn't even make it through a fraction of the available options.",

First of all, they would not pick up the dirty plates. It took them about 40 mins because I told two people. Then, the usual plantains and mash potatoes that they bring right when you sit down came about 45 minutes later. The bread, that I love, I asked for more and the waiter kept forgetting it. We only had like three types of meat offer again and again. Finally, I was fed up so I went to complain, which my wife hates, but I thought it was needed. The manager came by and offer us free desserts. But when we got the bill, they were charging us for the dessert.  I think someone should be training the team. This is not a cheap choice of eating out, so you expect at least better service.",

They will keep serving you until you keel over and die from a heart attack so be aware of the stop sign!  The salad bar has quite the selection as well, but I would minimize your intake here so you can try all the MEAT!  My one complaint is it seems like most of the MEATs have similar seasoning.  They have a large variety of different types of MEAT, but at some point it just all tastes the same...maybe I just have MEAT overload at that point.  This is definitely a place to experience, but I could never go here regularly.  I myself would rather go to a gourmet restaurant and have one great meal rather than gorge myself with MEAT, but I can see the allure of Fogo for sure!",

Because of this, I only come for lunch because it's slightly cheaper with similar food (if not exactly the same) as dinner.   This particular Fogo de Chao has great service and a really great manager. I was really impressed and it made my food taste even better!",

The buffet is always well stocked with delicious fresh vegetables, meats and cheeses but of course the real winner is the roasted meat that is carved at your table.  All the succulent cuts are wonderfully seasoned and cut at your table by temp you like.  We had the lamb, top sirloin and ribeye and everything was perfect.  Along with the great meal is great service, everyone is there to make sure you have everything you need at all times.  Finally you have to try their cheesy biscuits they are so great!

A big goblet in one hand, exquisite, endless dishes of extravagant foods being feed to you almost intravenously until you have gorged yourself jolly and need a coma to recover?  Well, your highness, there is a haven for you in Scottsdale.  Fogo de Chao is paradise for the carnivore AND the vegetarian alike.  You will be seated at a table amidst a spacious floor plan and promptly greeted politely with a drink order.  Then comes the salad bar, which hosts a cornucopia of fresh lettuces, tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, macaroni salads, cheeses, olives, cucumbers, prosciutto, salami, smoked salmon, ceviche, and hot white fish in a delectable sauce, among other things.  There is a round, 2 sided card at your table.  Red means stop, green means go.  When you have finished plundering the salad bar booty, turn your card so green is faced up.  This begins the carnivore carousel as a parade of servers will sprint to your table with one carving station after another of meat.  Oh, sure, you can wave them off if you're not interested, but who are you kidding?  Try EVERYTHING!!!  My personal favorites are the lamb chops, the lamb tenderloin, the sausage, the filet wrapped bacon, and the #1 - the top round - I order everything medium (did I mention that they ask you how you'd like it prepared?  And then they bring bottom round, garlic beef, chicken wrapped in bacon, ribs, center cut sirloin, rib eye, and probably a couple more that I can't remember.  Everything is tender and juicy, fresh, well seasoned, and fit for a king.  You are also served polenta cake, fried bananas and mashed potatoes, also never ending.  You may also request sauces - I'm particular to the mint jelly and the creamy horse radish, though they offer others.  And don't forget dessert - the cheesecake tastes like it was shipped in from New York that day.  GO FOR LUNCH!!!  It's only $29 at lunch time, $19 for just the salad bar, kids 6 and under FREE, otherwise $14 for kids.  A small king's ransom, but worth every penny and then some.  Then go back to your castle and nighty night.  Please don't behead your wife.",

    "text": "The first problem started our reservation. We had one for 6 and were not seated until 6:40. In our reservation we clearly stated we had 6 people, plus an infant. They did not have a table ready for us.   The service was great in the beginning and the people with meat came often. After about 40 minutes, they pretty much stopped coming around even though the green coasters were turned. My brother watched the baby at first and didn't really eat the first 40 minutes, so it was annoying how they just decided to stop coming around. On the bright side, our drinks were always full and very prompt with offering us fresh plates and keeping the table clean. They kept their delicious bread coming - which was a plus   We asked for a check and waited another 30 minutes for it to finally come around  Most of the meats were tasty and cooked well.  The salad bar leaves something to be desired. They need more options. At 50$ a person, it is pricy. I'll take my chances at another location next time I want a Brazilian steakhouse.",

The meat servers were slow to come and we had to continue to ask for the meat we preferred as well as clean plates and table foods to be replenished. Other tables seemed to get more attention so maybe it was our service area. Was a big event for us with out of town family. Disappointing.",

    "text": "We've had something similar at a \"Mongolian\" bbq joint down in Florida and it wasn't all that great.  So the wife I don't think had high expectations.  I was looking forward to this meaty delight as I'd heard good things.  Arizona Restaurant week provided a good opportunity to get out and sample this fine establishment.  As it turns out...this is what I was seeking.  The service by the staff that puts the food in front of you was great.  As we grabbed a table at the bar waiting for our buzzer to buzz in less than a minute we had a basket of cheese stuffed bread in front of us.  It was good.  The salad bar was good also.  Tried to go light on that to save room for the delightful meet onslaught that was to occur in the near future.  Notables were the potato, chicken, and apple salads.  All very good.    Now...flip the card over from red to green..and the staff that are running around every few minutes with different cuts of meats will drop by your table and ask you if you want some of what they're carrying.  It's an awesome site...seeing multiple filets skewered and getting hunks sliced off from whichever ones are cooked to your preference.  ...and let us not forget about the bacon wrapped fillet pieces also.  Some of the most flavorful things you will ever taste.  My wife isn't as much of a steak person as I am and she loved them.  The bacon-wrapped chicken was very good also.  The lamb also, very tasty.    The dessert was good also.  Wife had what was a pretty good piece of cheesecake if I recall correctly.  My key lime pie was also pretty good (not the best key lime I've had...but pretty good).  The \"bad\":  This could've been 5 stars.  There were 2 things that kept it from being so (one that bugged me more than my wife, and the other that really irked her and bugged me a little too).  1.  The AZ Restaurant week ad for this says \"During restaurant week guests will also choose from a selection of 12 decadent desserts.\" for the 3rd course.  We were given a choice of 3.  Cheesecake, Key LIme Pie, or a Chocolate cake.  I'm always irritated by False advertising.    2. The service was spectacular by all of the chefs.  It was great in general, until it was time for the bill.  We were beginning to wonder if they wanted us to eat for free.  We were waiting for over 15 minutes since they cleared our table for the bill.  At least 10-15 after someone had told us they would check on our bill.    So Fogo...you almost had 5 stars.  I cannot complain about the food though and the service in getting it to our table.  That part of it was great.",

The first dude to flip his card to red is a sissy.  Don't make plans after you eat here. You'll be so full are you likely to pass out in the parking lot.  Brilliant!  My favorites include the filet mignon with bacon and the ribeye.  The mashed potatoes and plantains are also great!  The salad bar is nice too, but skip it and eat all the meat you can possibly fit in your belly.  The first time we came here some doofus refilled my Mai Tai with iced tea.  Before I could let my complaint roll off my tongue, there was a manager there to correct the problem.",

    "text": "I came to this place for my birthday celebration with my fiance and another couple. I was definitely in a good mood.  THE FOOD  First, the salad bar. I am not much of a veggie lover, but the selection here is impressive, especially in light of this being a place where you eat the cow, not the cow's food. Besides a variety of veggies and dressings, you have a few cold cut meats, cheeses and smoked salmon to select from. From personal experience, tomatoes are good, all cheeses and meats are too. Salmon was simply delicious.  For the main course, it's all sorts of meat, mostly varieties of beef plus lamb and chicken. I liked all of them, but most of the beef was a salty to my taste (hence the loss of a star). Some of it can be explained by my getting the first cut off the meat several times, which meant that I got the salt seasoning in addition to the salt in the meat.  That aside, the meat is high quality and the main objective here is to remember not to get too much too soon, so you can enjoy everything the place has to offer.  Sides were small (as they should be) and included polenta, mashed potatoes and fried bananas. All good.  The wine selection is extensive and from our limited tasting, quite good. We had Cabernet and malbec.  SETTING This is a rather large stand alone restaurant, but has surprisingly personal feeling, especially if you consider the amount of staff running around. It is not too brightly lit and has generally darker tones to the interior. There is also a cozy bar to the side of the main entrance that is a pleasant place to wait for others to arrive.  SERVICE Attentive and not at all pushy.  OVERALL I came here in a good mood and left in an even better mood and feeling like a python after eating a cow. Which was close enough to True amount of food in me. Highly recommend this both for the experience and the food itself.",

    "text": "Don't fill up on the Salad Bar.  These are great words of wisdom that a friend gave to me many years ago before I went to the Fogo de Chao in Washington D.C.  Good advice.  I eat my salad after the meat.  Meat is the main reason to go to Fogo de Chao.  And it was not disappointing.  But, be sure to vocalize what you want.  Tell the individual with the large sword of meat that you prefer yours Rare or medium rare or burnt.  They will find that for you and bring it to you.  Here it was no exception.    My one complaint was that we ordered a magnum of wine off of the wine list.  After a few minutes, the waiter came over and said they were out of that magnum but here was another that was equally as good.  I asked if the price was the same.  No he answered.  It was $50 more.  I called over the manager, Ryan, to complain.  Ryan admitted that they had been out of that bottle for over a week.  He did not have an answer as to why they couldn't have printed up a new wine list with their laser printer.  And Ryan was somewhat offended when I told him I felt like they were trying to up sell me the other bottle of wine when they didn't offer it to us at the price of the wine that they didn't have.  That said, after Ryan and I discussed the matter we were able to work out an acceptable resolution.  But really, in this day and age of computer inventory and laser printers, can't you have a wine list that is up to date?   That said, we had a great meal.  Meat delivered the way we like it and a cool refreshing salad at the end.  Perfect!  Thank you for a great dinner.  We look forward to your new San Diego location.",

Filet Mignon, Parmesan Pork, Top or Bottom sirloin (Yes there is a bottom sirloin), Rib eye, etc.  They bring you steak until you can't eat anymore.  They also bring you unlimited mash potatoes, cheesy bread, and fried bananas.  Not only is the food top notch, the service is a well.

    "text": "I have heard great things about this but we didn't have a good experience.  We went for my birthday(3/29 8PM). We were seated quickly (in a back room) and the 1st server was pleasant. That's where things went wrong. While we went off to the salad bar, we were told bread, water, etc. would be brought to our table. We returned 10 mins later, no water, no bread, no server to be found. Eventually, a young server happened upon our table and was surprised we had no bread, water or PLATES. Went off to see too it. Another 3 or 4 similar visits and someone else asked us if we needed something. I said, yup, water, bread and PLATES (we still couldn't have any of the meat coming around as we had no where to put it) and a manager.  The manager arrived and asked what we needed and, well, yeah, had to point that out to him too as if it wasn't pretty clear we had no plates after 20-25 mins sitting there with nothing to do but toy with the salad scraps.  Off he went.... more time passed and eventually we got the water, bread and some plates bit by bit. One would think he would have quickly resolved this but nope. BTW Skip the bread or whatever those round balls of doughy things were in the basket.   The meats.... most of them were dry and they cut pieces off the outsides which were hard crust. There were two that were fairly good (rib eye and top round) and my dinner companion enjoyed the pork encrusted with parm. By the time we were situated, the servers had stopped making the rounds in the back two rooms.  Most everyone left  One most interesting things was at one point, our \"server\" (young maybe 20s I swear his picture is the one in the additional tips for the business offered...get rid of him) that was supposed to bring a plate was so busy chatting and flirting with a couple at another table (he was there a good 10-15 mins and over and over - taking a business card from the female) and the rest of the \"servers\" who were not making the rounds with meats were grouped in a bunch talking... it was a wonder the \"manager' didn't make some effort to stop the behaviors.  The server with the plate in his hand finally managed to drop it in front of me without even looking down at us or saying a word before running back to his discussion across the room.  Me, I would have fired him on the spot as it was THAT BAD.  Salad bar - lame at best. It looked nice but not really much to speak of for such a huge place that is high-end price-wise. For instance, the tomatoes were a main item - they shouldn't have been served they were so under ripe - just one example.  Sides -  Slapped down like an after thought on our table - Mash potatoes that were horrible - had to be from freeze dried. For that matter, the mash potatoes from freeze dried at the market are better by a factor of 10.  What's with you  Fogo de Chao!  Honestly, I can't imagine that the review I saw here relate to the food in this place. Just because they have a lot of different meats (17 we were told) does not make a place a good value or the food well prepared.   I could not WAIT to get out of there and wrote \"HORRIBLE SERVICE\" on the check. My comment was we could have eaten at one of the very best steak places in the valley for the same price range compared to this horrible service/food that was equal to a buffet line and meat that shouldn't have been served in 9 times out of 10 samples we had. I left with a greasy feeling in my stomach.  The worst highlight - sitting without plates for 15-20 mins. and the manager having to be asked if he saw anything particularly wrong with that.  Sitting there in an almost empty room (3 tables out of 20) and NO servers coming around. Watching one of the waiters talk to a female guest at a table for what seemed like all evening at various points - I hope she has a job for you because if your management sees your behavior, hopefully, they get rid of you before they lose any more customers.  Keep in mind that this is not a 2 dinners for $20 special. This is a $50 a person plus extra's Scottsdale higher end eatery.  Although, it was worse than Applebees and that is saying A LOT.  NEVER again.",

    "text": "A friend of mine recently invited us to join for his birthday dinner at Fogo. My initial thought was \"what am I going to be able to eat here?!\"  but was assured that their salad bar was \"banging\".  So, alas we arrive and the woman and I hit up the bar while we waited for our peeps.  She got a really great dark beer and I tried to go outside of the box and ordered a melon martini.  It was terrible, but I didn't want to send it back cause it was kind of my own fault.  The bartender, however, noticed my full glass and asked if there was something else he could get for me.  Thank you sir!!!  I got a glass of Malbec instead, and it was great.  Our friends arrived, and we were seated.  It was like a whirlwind of craziness after.  Our server twirled on over and explained super fast how the place worked and what it was all about.  He went around asking what we all wanted to drink, and when he got to my lady, he called her sir...annoying.  She clearly is a woman.  Whatev, stuff happens sometimes when you're high on meat fumes.  After he was done with our drink order, we all got up to grab some salad.  Now, I know that this place is a meat house, but if you're gonna charge me 23 bones for my salad bar, please, make it great!  I grabbed some lettuce and started walking around to see what else I wanted.  There were these huge asparagus piled high, so I grabbed a few.  Then I grabbed some green beans, huge beet slices and broccoli, too.  I went to the dressings and was kind of disappointed.  There were ranch, caesar, and what looked and tasted like zesty Italian from Kraft. Boo.  Everything looked really good, but nothing was seasoned at all.  I mean, I appreciate being given the option to season my own items, but plain bland everything?  I want some flavor people!    Once seated, meat on sticks came from every direction.  It's kind of funny to watch.  Two of my dining companions ordered limeades, and no joke, had to ask for refills from multiple people (at least four times!) before someone came by with a pitcher.    The boyfriend of the birthday boy decided to propose that evening, and asked them to please bring the ring out on the dessert plate, and they did so very well.  I'll give them a star for that.  It was cute and sweet, both literally and figuratively.  I just ordered an after dinner coffee for my dessert, and everyone seemed please with their treats.  Ugh, then when it came time to pay, we decided that I would put $100 on my card and the rest was in cash.  When someone FINALLY came by to pick up the bill, I explained this.  He looked very confused. So, I repeated \"Just 100 on the card and the rest cash.\" Simple enough, right?  Not so much.  It literally took about ten minutes for someone else to bring our monies back and when they did, the guy used all the cash and put the remainder of $61 on my card (I'm just glad is wasn't more than what I asked him to put on)...but still, I serve bro! It's not hard to do!  I was completely underwhelmed by my experience here and do not plan on returning.  At least I won't suffer from any meat sweats.  NEXT!",

    "text": "I've had two experiences at Fogo.  One with a very large party and one with a party of four.  Both the service and food were consistent.  For anyone new to Fogo, it's a fixed price (about $45) for salad bar and all you can eat meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb).  Start with salad bar (save room) and flip your little card to green when you're ready for meat.  A parade of servers will offer their wares, say yeah or neah and wait for the next.  Flip card to red when you don't need service.  Salad bar is fantastic.  I can't resist the smoked salmon, mozzarella balls, and apple salad.  In fact, on my second trip, I loaded up so much from the salad bar, I skipped the meat entirely.  I'm also particularly fond of the polenta and bread (which is more like a popover).  Based on my first experience, some of the meat offerings are better than others.  But since you can have as much or as little of anything as you would like, try everything.  I can also recommend the papaya cream for dessert.  Don't worry you won't have room.  It's light enough that you can make room.  As far as service, it is excellent.  As soon as you flip that card to green, servers are there.  The only complaint on both visits is that they do ask if they can bring you a particular cut of meat, and then they don't follow through anyway.  It's not like you'll go hungry, but it can be a little annoying.",

Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :(",

You have the choice of picking rare, medium or well done. The whole dining experience was outstanding!!!! I can't believe we have a location in La I can't wait to go back!!!!!

I have also skipped the meat on occasion and gone just for the salad bar, which is excellent and full of good things - not typical American salad bar items.  I was happy with it.

They have these like circle cards that you turn around to green when you want the waiters to come around with meat and when you want them to stop just turn it over to red !   Their limeade is to die for! It's super fresh and taste like no other limeade I have tasted before .   They have all kinds of meet from chicken , filet , lamb , sausage everything ! And it's all you can eat too ! So come hungry! They also have a salad bar where they have potato salad chicken salad veggies fruit etc   Also if you want a fresh plate because all the meats are blending together just ask !   Definitely worth every cent!",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 4.5/5 Happiness 5/5  I am often too critical. So say my friends about movies and my wife about, a lot of stuff. But here's a place that I can't really find anything to complain about except myself (OVERATING ALERT is in effect here big time).  I love Brazilian steakhouses. For those that don't know what it is, its an all you can eat restaurant with salad bar (including soups, salads, cured meets, smoked salmon, various cheeses) shared sides for the table (potatoes, a cheesy bread, polenta, and mashed potatoes) and the STAR of the show - a variety of meats carved tableside. You turn a coaster to green and the meats keep coming in. You turn a coaster to red, the meats stop.   First, i LOVE the place. GIANT wooden doors. A huge room with beautiful tables. Literally an army of wait staff to serve you. I ordered a bottle of wine for the first time there recently and while mega-expensive (like wine at all restaurants), the servers were quick on the pour and didn't drop even a splosh on the white tablecloth (better than I can say for myself).  LUNCH is a great deal - you get almost the entire dinner menu for roughly half the cost. Just don't plan on eating dinner!  The salad bar alone is sumptuous enough, and I have had to learn not to fill up there beforehand since what I want is the stead, lamb and chicken (they also serve pork as well - I can't eat pork).   The one thing to know is that you need to be aggressive in asking for some of the meats. Notably, it takes a few tries to get the beef ribs and the lamb chops, both of which are absolutely worth the hassle to get them to bring out.   The only other thing to watch out for is the price - you get the bang for your buck, but the bucks accumulate VERY quickly here. Still I've never left unsatisfied, unless by my own hand when I've let myself become overstuffed!",

I hate that I have to ask for ribs but love that they make it happen as soon as you ask. I also really like the chefs table and could probably eat enough there and never need all of the food to follow. It's definitely a welcome change to the average dinner out. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the meats are sometimes very dry, lamb in particular is over cooked and when I asked for some that was more rare, they brought me the same stuff. Also would like to see consistency in the quality of service.",

The servers were very accommodating, asking what I would like served if I passed on options like sausages or chicken.  The Salad Bar was also awesome, several items to choose from.  The Mashed Potatoes, Fried Polenta and cooked bananas side dishes were also all welcomed, just ask your server if you'd like more of anything as they are also included with your meal.

    "text": "This sort of place (churrascarias) actually used to be one of my favorite kinds of restaurants to enjoy. That is until I became a vegetarian about a year and a half ago... Now, as you might imagine, I don't tend to go as often. But when family comes to town to visit, I let them pick the food destinations...  So now you're probably wondering what a vegetarian could possibly eat in the midst of this parade of meat. Well, the nice thing about Fogo de Chao for me is their killer salad bar, sides and desserts... Starting a wide array of veggies at the salad bar from the hearty asparagus spears and artichoke heart cups to the selection of cheeses and crafted salads and adding on to that the fried polenta sprinkled with Parmesan, cheesy mashed potatoes and fried banana sides, I definitely wasn't going to go home hungry at the end of the night.  But the food didn't stop there for us just yet... We ended up choosing the Signature Papaya Cream and Flan desserts for the three of us to share. First, the flan...  It was very good. Rich and unusually denser that the typical flan, it had a very flavorful caramel taste. Although, if you've just stuffed yourself on a bunch of meat (or in my case veggies), it may be a bit much. The real dessert star was the Papaya Cream though. Light,  yet extremely flavorful with the added bonus of the natural digestif qualities of papaya, it was the perfect sweet ending to our meal.",

    "text": "Fogo De Chao was the first churrascaria I had eaten at many years ago back in Dallas. The first time you experience one, you'll understand why the eateries are near and dear to many people's hearts. At these Brazilian steakhouses, gauchos encircle your table to offer you various delectable cuts of beef, lamb, chicken and pork. The format is no-menu, single fee, all-you-can-eat extravaganza.  The price at this Fogo in particular as of this writing here in Phoenix is $42.50 per person, which is a bargain considering the amount and quality of food offered. Once you're seated, you're offered drinks and then you're free to immediately indulge in one of the most high-class 'salad bar' experience you'll ever have. Really, calling it that doesn't do it any justice.  After you've had your fill of vegetation and the like, you may begin the onslaught of meat. There is a small card that is next to you that you flip to 'green' to attract the gauchos and 'red' when you'd like to take a break. Come to Fogo expecting to practice gluttony. You will savor mouth-watering cuts of meat including fillet, top and bottom sirloin, lamb chops, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped fillet and bacon-wrapped chicken, pork sausage and ribs and others. They're all exceptional though you may like some things more than others.  There are a few words of warning. You will consume a lot of food. The meats are highly salted to bring out the most of their flavor and the beef is cooked to the rare side. In short, this is not a health food experience. This is for the meat lover in a meat-eating mood.  You can feel free to intersperse the vegetables at the salad bar while eating the meat. As well, a few sides are provided: garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried bananas. Fogo has many fine deserts though I tend to stick with the recommended Papaya Cream, which is a lighter fare after consuming pounds of meat.  As for the rest of Fogo, the setting is noisy but gorgeous. There's always a festive atmosphere about the place. With all the hustle and bustle occasionally, you might be overwhelmed and you might be forgotten about for a few minutes... unless your card is 'green'!  Overall, Fogo offers good value for money, an excellent setting and an unbeatable churrascaria experience. Probably my favorite restaurant of all time.",

    "text": "I reserve leaving feedback for very few restaurants.  Fogo made the cut after last night's dinner. Each time we visit this location we are blown away with the service, quality, and quantity that feed into the entire experience. Our criticism comes from a service standpoint, if you want to read about the food...move on to another review.  We were approached later in our meal to see if we were avid yelpers  in order to provide feedback for recognition. Derek, unbeknownst  to us, was the top salesman in wines and won 2/3 of the contests they last participated in.  He was rather discontent however due to the lack of financial stability he received with the shared tips policy.   This abundance of information was provided on our first interaction with Derek as he cleared our places.  This conversation  was the only negative experience we had during our visit. Our primary server Danya was superb in everything she did. I prefer iced tea and I tend to drink a fair amount when dining out. My glass never sat empty nor did my wife's. The sides were constantly replenished. When we wanted a specific cut, Danya made it happen with a quickness at that. I don't pay decent money for a meal to hear about problems of servers, rather to be well taken care of.  Any other day without Derek would pull a 5 star review hands down, and because of Danya,  a 3 star was avoided.",

    "text": "My husband took me here for my birthday dinner and we were so looking forward to it until we stepped foot into the building. It was all downhill from there with very little upswing. Hostess was MIA when we walked in, not usually a big deal but with such an upscale place I guess I was expecting a greeting, oh well. She came back and seated us at the smallest table for 2 I have ever seen. Situated along the wall with a four top at our elbows and a service station at my back, literally. Ok not bad, I can work with this I guess.. Server explained the dining experience without introducing herself and was not seen again. On to the salad bar which was oh so disappointing. Luke warm, flavorless asparagus soup, caeser salad with almost no dressing or croutons on it, sad looking pineapple and papaya slices were just about all the choice we had. The potato salad was probably the best tasting thing in the whole bar. On to the meats! The best part in my opinion. Most of them were pretty rare though, read bloody, not my 1st choice but most had good flavor. Some did not. The chicken was very dry, as was the pork. The best was the leg of lamb, so much flavor and very moist. The 'fried polenta' was not polenta. It was some sort of previously frozen root vegetable not polenta. The bananas were nice and the cheese bread was pretty flavorless, not my favorite. About halfway thru the meal a server knocked a water pitcher off the service station behind us getting my back sprinkled with ice cold water. The customer service lady was very nice and offered us a free dessert. I choose the key lime pie and my husband got the cheesecake. Both were very bland. Frozen then thawed and drizzled with Lyons flavored syrup. Not worth the calories and definatly not worth the $9 most people pay for them. So very glad we had coupons for dinner because it was not worth the $109 bill without tip. Overall very dissapointed with my experience and won't be returning. I'll take Texas de Brazil anyday over this place. Don't waste your time or money here.",

I am also a boo hooer of salad bars but this one was different, it had beautiful parmesan cheese, the real deal, nice charcuterie and roasted asparagas.  The meats were succulent and delicious, i love the lamb chops, the filet mignon and the signature sirloin.  The stand out was the service at this Fogo de Chao, the meat carvers were on top of their game and it turns out they are  all from Brazil and work here in the states for one year.  One of them told us that he was going to Open the Denver Restaurant and then was off to Baltimore for 2 months.  It turns out that the owners rent places for them and the share quarters around the country.  management at all other restaurants are Brazilian except the Scottsdale one.  The wait staff is composed of local college age people who have been indoctrinated into the Brazilian style of european service.  it is a delightful experience! I don't think anyone could eat here as a regular diet but a few times a year won't kill you.  I for one can't wait to go back!",

The fresh salad/vegetable bar was very well stocked with a great variety of fruits, vegetables, and Brazilian favorites. The meat selection as they came around was very good, but I couldn't help thinking that I saw sirloin's much more often than the more tender rib selections. Lamb was a once a night occurence, so I walked away full, but thinking I missed out.on some of the better cuts that night. In addition, when we had been there just 45 minutes there was a clear message that it was time to go. I'm not used to that an a fairly expensive restaurant, especially when we're enjoying drinks, but they needed to cycle our table. Would I go back? I think I'll have to try another Brazilian steakhouse and see if I walk away feeling the same.",

    "text": "Maybe because it was Valentine's Day night and it was busy... but unfortunately, I'd have to say this place is OVERRATED.  Good thing about this place is that the restaurant is located in a nice upscale area and is easily visible from the main road.  Fancy decor and high class environment.  People understand that it is upscale so for the most part everyone is dressed up.  Good ambiance for a romantic dinner.    For the food, you're paying $50 for each person for a salad bar and unlimited meat.  Now the food wasn't bad at all.  Everything at the salad bar tasted good and it was all fresh.  The meats portion really depends on how much of the different choices you like.  Being that it was my first time, I wanted to really experience what they had to offer and get a little bit of everything.  Problem with that... everything wasn't great.   I would have rather ordered a dish that i preferred and got full off that.  But instead i ate a mixture of things that liked and things that I don't really care to try again.  At the end of the day, none of the different cuts wow'ed me.    The reason I'm giving this such a bad review was the service.  Again, I'm sure it was because it was Valentine's Day but It was just horrible!  Servers come to tables with the different meat randomly and there were times where everyone had empty plates and it took a while for another server to come.  Also, some of the meat never came to our table so we had to ask for them towards the end of the meal.  At the end of the meal, they brought out our dessert twice and forgot the hot tea.  Different waiters were asking if we needed anything, but they would forget about it.  They just didn't seem organized.  Finally, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our bill.  They did apologize for it because their \"system was down.\"  Finally, we got a bill and noticed that the 2 beers we ordered and the dessert wasn't on there.  I thought that was a nice gesture to compensate for the wait.  However, a couple of minutes later another waiter comes and tells us that we received the wrong bill!  He then gives us the correct one with everything on it.  I'm not complaining that we had to pay for what we got, but that just made them look so bad.  Ultimately, if I make reservations at a restaurant, come dressed up, and I'm paying $50/person for a so-so meal, they better be on point when it comes to customer service.  Our servers knew that it was our first time there and they did nothing for us that would make us want to come back.",

Service here was excellent and you definitely get a wide variety of meat options, but I only found two out of the 6+ choices tasty. The lamb leg and the bacon wrapped filet were delicious but the sausages, pork, chicken, pork/beef ribs and even filet mignon were unimpressive.  The salad bar a $22.50 upcharge wasn't exactly worth the price. Nothing stood out, and there wasn't anything amazing that I went back for seconds for.  Sides were complimentary, which included fried polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. They were pretty good, but don't compare to the lobster mash or truffle mac and cheese as Mastro's.  The ambience is definitely nice and upscale without being stuffy. Plenty of kids running around and guys with backwards facing hats on. This was my first legitimate Brazilian steakhouse experience and I think it will be my last. If  you're looking for variety go to KBBQ and you'll also leave feeling overstuffed, satisfied, and still have an extra $50 in your wallet.",

Dining at this location previously on Christmas Eve and the San Diego location during restaurant week, I know that even when they are busy the servers tend to the customers in a timely manner but tonight was completely different. We were sat and our drinks brought to us promptly but that's about where the good service ended. After that we didn't see any server for the rest of the night. No one came to ask if we would like a refill on our drinks which sat empty for over an hour. When we finished our meal we sat there waiting for our check. 20 minutes later we decided to stack our plates thinking maybe someone would get the idea. A bus boy came by to take our plates after 10 minutes or so. Still no check. The bus boy returned about 20 minutes later to see if we had been helped and went to find someone to bring us our check. The food was outstanding as usual. The customer service on the other hand was deplorable. As I was leaving I decided to speak to a manager. The gentleman that came out treated me as if I was lying to him when I explained that the whole meal not a single person came to our table besides the men bringing the various meats and that we waited for over 45 minutes after eating our meal before we received our check. He made snide comments about how that couldn't be possible and that maybe they were just too busy. He ingeniously thanked me for the feedback and walked away leaving me with no apology or real concern on his part. When the table next to us receives multiple refills on their drinks and gets their check before us when we were done long before them, there is a problem that needs addressed. All I can say is that for those of you that do choose to dine here, I hope that your experience is better than mine and that you don't have any plans for the rest of the night because you will probably be spending more time than necessary waiting to be waited on.",

He apologized and walked away.....2nd waiter arrived to explain the salad bar and meat course......Salad bar did not live up to my expectations.....Back to the table and here comes the meat!! It kept coming and coming and coming!! I had to flip my card to red indicating \" I'm good on meat for now\". .....the meat carvers were very accommodating and professional , but after awhile the meat started to taste the same.  I'm done! Overall the restaurant is big and beautiful however I won't be back. It's more of a meat show , not a dining experience. For that reason I'm Out!!",

You don't get that one server in a bad mood or that's new, overwhelmed, working the tail end of a double.  They all work as a team so you get constant, prompt attention to your needs.  The \"salad bar\" is amazing considering I hate vegetables. It has Lox, fresh cheese, cured meats, fruit .. delicious.  The meat selections are incredible and if you seem to not have got what you wanted, tell one of the guys and they come bursting out of the kitchen right away with your request.  If you have a chance, book the private room behind the hostess stand. Well worth it. I've been at least once a year for 8 years.",

There's this huge salad bar buffet with people loading up their plates and stuffing their faces with too much food. The lights are very bright at dinnertime and the tables are lined up tightly together all in a row.   But the food is very good. The unlimited gluten-free cheesy dinner rolls taste like popovers. I kept asking if they were really gluten-free because they tasted so good!  The meats carved up tableside were all delicious and the servers were friendly, if hurried.   In all, I recommend this place if you're looking for a different dining experience every once in a long while but a relaxed dining experience it is not.",

We sat 30 mins without one piece of meat coming to us. I had to complain to the manager, one of three I might add. Before anyone came out with the terribly unseasoned fatty piece of meat. Other than that no other food was served to us. My sons birthday dinner was ruined and nothing was done to rectify the situation. For the amount of money you are paying (which ranges from $55.00 and up per person) for an experience as they say...you would think between 3 managers they would know how to keep the food flowing and manage the dining room..absolutely terrible!",

Many guests were dressed down and some were actually wearing hoodies and sweatpants which surprised us. We went for my birthday so I was dressed up. But thankfully, dressing up still goes with the restaurants environment. The service was noteworthy for a positive review. All servers were very kind and polite, and man do they make sure you are doing okay. The food was good. So for $54 per person, it's basically all you can eat. There is a food bar to start with. Includes salads, cheeses, soup, rice, veggies, etc. Then the meats (beef, chicken, lamb) are brought to your table upon request and served onto your plate. We got full very fast. The meats were delicious. They're signature drinks are very tasty. And they gave me a complimentary slice of cake with a candle.",

If you are a vegetarian, don't even bother.  they do offer up sides and have a huge salad bar, but I skip that.  I come for the meat. It's a prepaid meal, so you can sit for hours and eat all the meat you want.    The decor is gorgeous.  The only downfall is the nonstop constant interruption.  Now, the waitstaff is attentive, no doubt.  But even without the green 'bring meat' card, we were constantly bombarded with people coming up to us. It was exhausting and hard to have a conversation.  STill a great place to go have amazing meat.  Do not eat all day and have AT it here.",

You will get into food coma. I am a little disappointed with the quality of customer service that night . The hostess wasn't very nice, very stand-off ish. Not sure why but should be nicer to your guest when they come to your restaurant. Hopefully she will be nicer next time. Our bartender, wished we remembered her name, she was AMAZING!  They were slammed and yet she makes sure you are the only one sitting at the bar. Now let's chat about their signature meal which is MEAT! Lamb was so good it melts in your mouth, sirloin, chicken, pork and oh my bacon! You are intreat for every bites you take. I didn't even tell you about their salad bar! The unlimited salad bar but you don't want to fill yourself with salad because you want to eat the meat . All and all we always enjoy our time there no matter whAt. It's an experience!",

I knew it was not a classy place after one of the managers walked around and offered a buy one get one on the next visit and then offered 15 dollars off next visit if we signed up for email.  Im pretty sure the cows the meat were cut from were crack dairy cows.  Bottom line is if you enjoy to pretend your classy and you want to wear your house slippers to dinner this place is for you. Also if you enjoy paying 15 dollars for a glass of wine to which the bottles value is actually 10 dollars hot this place up.",

    "text": "What says romance more than a medium rare filet mignon?? At Fogo de Chao you'll find more than just steaks, but a plethora of hardy meats, a fabulous salad bar and undivided service. And I forgot to mention, it's all you can eat!  I came on weekday to avoid the rush and try out their luncheon menu since I've dined at the other locations. I made reservations via Open Table and didn't know if it was necessary but glad I did because it was busy with casual and business eaters.  At the hostess table, I checked in and was promptly escorted to a table by the wall. The server asked if this was my first time because there is a certain way to order food. When the green coaster is flipped up, this notifies the gauchos (carvers) to come to your table with the meat(s). Each would carry a long skewer ready to cut you a slice by table-side.    Once seated, I ordered our drinks and made a mad dash to the Market Table (a.k.a. salad bar) which had a huge variety of cold vegetarian options, cheeses, smoked salmon, and on the side hot dishes included a butternut squash soup, freijoda (black beans with pork) and white rice. The soup was outstanding and my favorite veggies were the pear and endive salad, the roasted veggies, hearts of palm and the quinoa tabbouleh.  Now came the highlight... the meat! I won't bore you with all the succulent description but I'll highlight my favorite cuts in order:  Filet Mignon Garlic Steak Fraldinha (bottom sirloin) Cordeiro (lamb both the rack and meat cut)  Each one of these were juicy, well-seasoned and perfectly cooked to your preference. To get through all these proteins, I always requested the small cut so I could sample and come back to my favorites.  Just when you think you're done, they also serve family style side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes, caramelized fried bananas, fried polenta and those addicting pao de queijo (soft cheesy rolls). The servers kept an eye if I ever needed a refill which was a nice touch.  Who could think about dessert? All I thought about was flipping my coaster to red!  My only problem with this location was the lack of space between the tables. I had to maneuver around the chairs and carvers when we walked to/from the Market Table.   For lunch, I highly recommend ordering the \"Fogo Churrasco Experience\" ($33) where you can enjoy all the variety of meats and the Market Table.   Everything about this meal hit the spot and I look forward coming back again!",

Apon entering the restaurant the decor was beautiful, you can tell this is a very upscale place. As we were seated they had a table waiting for us and provided cheese bread which was delicious. The waiter came up to us and explained how this all works. On your table, there is a circular card which I thought was a coaster on one side was green the other red. Green indicates you are ready to be served meat and red means not at this time. You have a choice of many different types of meats, a salad bar and sides of rice, beans etc.  As we made our way to the salad bar I was very unimpressed with the very minimal choices they had for an all you can eat salad bar. Being an upscale restaurant I expected so much more. Some of the items on the salad bar were not even labeled so I had no idea what they were. As we made our way back to the table and flipped our card around the meat started coming our way. They have many different choices pork, chicken, beef, etc. As I was trying the different meats only a few stood out. The bacon wrapped chicken and parmesan pork were my favorites. I tried several other types of meat some were too salty and others were really bland. I even asked the waiter for a specific type of meat I wanted and it never came around. At times this place can be a bit overwhelming with everything going on.  In my honest opinion, I really did not think it was worth $52.00 per person. I would have rather gone to Orange sky or Donovans and had a steak.",

The salad bar is fully stocked with everything you may want on a salad. Its a lot of food and I was told to pace myself so I didn't get full before the meats. I enjoyed two plates of salad and was very satisfied with their selection.   The endless meats were good. The portions are small so it keeps you from over eating. Personally I thought they could be better seasoned but they were still good. The only issue was that all the servers came at once so it was easy to get overwhelmed on the meats and end up getting full faster. I asked for well done and most skewers on hand are not necessarily well cooked. When I was brought a well done piece of meat it was burnt and I didn't end up liking it.   A small bottled Coke was $3 with obviously no refills. This I can do without. Buffets should give free refills! I didn't know the pricing before coming in. Had I known it would be $115 for two people, I probably would have reconsider. It was good, the service is decent (my main server never came back), the food is delicious, like I said the salad bar was beyond what I expected. With cheese and meats plus different types of salad mix, it was really good. The meats were good.. not amazing, but good. Was it all worth $55? I don't know yet.   I'd probably come back now that I know what to expect. I'll probably starve myself all morning so I can my money's worth, though!",

For those of you that have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you should definitely try it out! It's definitely a great experience and it's an all you can eat restaurant! There's a little card that has the color green on one side and red on the other. Whenever you want the guys to come around with the different kinds of meat to your table, then you want the card to be on the green side.   So The guys come around to your table and they ask you \"how you do like your meats prepared\". Based on how you like it cooked, they slice a portion of it and you grab it with your tongs that's been provided at your table.   I didn't give them 4 or 5 stars because of their meats. I've been here once before which was amazing, but for some reason today it wasn't so great. I believe they have ten different kinds of meats and I swear pretty much all of them were overcooked. Some of the meats were dry and super salty because of the seasoning. Before I loved how most of the red meats tasted, but today I couldn't finish most of them and only stuck to one.   The appetizers that were brought to our table were mash potatoes, polenta, cheese bread, sugared bananas, which were okay. My favorite dish out of all of them would have to be the mash potatoes because they blended it so well! It was smooth, kinda like a pureed food.  The service was great like always and since it was my brothers bday we got the papaya cream. The papaya cream is one of their signature dessert and it's basically papaya and vanilla ice cream blended together. It's good and light!",

    "text": "Do not...I repeat...do not eat anything the day you come here. You will need the stomach space. Hostesses were not very helpful when we arrived 15 min early and provided no instruction as to when/where to wait. We told them we would be at the bar next to the desk and they said they would get us when our table was ready. They forgot about us.   After going back to the desk for a third time, we were finally shown to our seat. If you are seated next to the wall like us, it will feel like you are in Mario Kart, dodging meat servers, waiters, chairs, and people getting up for salad. We enjoyed several of the Signature Caipirinhas, which are tangy, sweet and refreshing.   The salad bar had some really unique options and don't forget to visit the hot bar next to salad for items to accompany your meats galore. They will give you a few sides table side, including polenta (yum!) and mashed potatoes and a fries banana dessert. We appreciated the little card to signal when you want more meat or when you need a breather (and elastic pants).   As for the meats, we were overwhelmed by beef that all seemed the same. Even as beef lovers, we tended to prefer the pork, chicken (the one on the bone) and sausages. While many mention the high price, the amount of food (and expensive meats) constantly offered to your table is worth it. A bit chaotic and I doubt we will go back but a unique and fun experience to have at least once.",

    "text": "Fogo de Chao reaffirmed that I love meat. Thank you so freaking much!  I will say that the integrated Yelp reservation system does wonders, I highly recommend it.  The meal comes in two phases: salad bar and served meat. You'll get some side dishes, and meat carvers will come to your table to offer you various cuts and cooking temperatures. They actually carve a different part of the meat block depending what you want, which I thought was really cool. Technically they're only supposed to come when the card they give you is green instead of red, but they came nonstop anyways and I love them for it.  Keep in mind with this high end service and variety of meats the meal will be somewhat expensive, around the $50 range. However, if you haven't gone I suggest you do, because this sits at my Top 5 Restaurants of all time right now.   And as much as you love meat... please don't come alone. The more the merrier, otherwise you'll just look like a sad pig rolling in the mud.",

Taking our seat, we are graciously greeted by our server and informed of our 5 step process for an unforgettable experience: Step 1: Visit our gourmet salad and sides bar. Enjoy over 30 items including fresh cut vegetables, imported cheeses, cured meats and Brazilian side dishes.  Step 2: Turn your card green side up, signaling that you are ready for our gaucho chefs to begin tableside service.  Step 3: Choose from the 15 cuts of delectable fire roasted meats that are brought to your table, sliced, and served by our gaucho chefs.  Step 4: When you are satisfied, flip the disc to the red side until you are ready for more offerings.  Step 5: If you wish, end the meal with one of our delicious desserts  The salad bar was impressive! My jaw dropped when I saw the jumbo asparagus and tabbouleh salad! I would have been satisfied with just that, but before I could cover my entire plate with greens, I looked ahead and was the imported cheeses, artisan breads, cured meats! When we returned, we had pao de queijo (warm cheese bread),  polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas waiting for us at our table!  These side dishes were delicious! It was extremely hard not to fill up on the salad bar and sides!  Ready for dinner, we flipped our card to green! The gaucho chefs were a little slow on service but our server was right there to take any request to help speed up the process! I have to be honest, we weren't a fan of most but found 2 of the 10 varieties, the Cordeiro (Leg of Lamb) and Lamb TBone, our favorite! We didn't waste our time and passed on everything else! We had about 4 rounds of the Lamb Leg and TBone!   Our server insisted we order dessert but we just didnt have room in our tummy's! He asked us to look at the menu and tell him what we would have ordered if we could, so we told him the Fogo de Chao Signature Papaya Cream.  Along with the check, he presented us a complimentary bag of the papaya cream!   Hopefully all locations provide the same food and experience we have had here in AZ!",

The hostess said I could but would need to go to the website and buy a gift card and phone the gift card number in. It would be applied to their bill. I did this and confirmed my sons name and and reservation time. Apparently when my son got there was a note that he saw that said \"anniversary\" and \"gift card\". Great,  surprise ruined. It gets worse. He wasn't sure why it said \"gift card\" and didn't mention it to his wife or the wait staff.  The bill comes to $130 with no gift card applied ($150 gift card). He pays and walks out. He is wondering about it and calls my wife to ask her about it. She explains what I did. He then goes back and asked the staff what happened to the gift card. They realize the mistake and refund his money and apply the gift card to his bill. I'm definitely not happy about how this was handled. Seems like  a pretty simple process and the staff blew it.",

It became a joke between me and my husband--seriously, every meat that came by was sirloin. Oh, and there was some dry chicken. And a really chewy bacon-wrapped filet (once). By the time we finished eating, we saw that there was a pork chop, some lamb, and some sausages floating around, but we were done. We sat there for over an hour and none of those meats ever made it to our table. How is that even possible?  They have a decent salad bar, but it's pretty limited, and the ranch dressing tastes like Hidden Valley. Nasty. I wish I had gone to Talking Stick, or Jasmine Palace, or even freaking Sweet Tomatoes for what I paid at Fogo de Chao! Also, the meat all had a strong gas taste, which was really unappetizing. So completely disappointing. I wouldn't go back unless it was free, much less pay what I did.",

The sides are included, with Carmelized banana, polenta, cheesy mashed potatoes and of course the gluten free cheese buns are awesome. Order a second basket, and hide them in your purse!  But it's all about the meat, cooked the way you want it, delivered to your table in a constant parade until you finally surrender and turn up the red card.

This is an all-you-can-eat place for 50 bucks. The salad bar is fabulous, I will say that. Tons of fresh selections and tons of variety as well. Not your normal salad bar. The salad bar could be your entire meal and a pretty good one at that.  This is a Brazilian steakhouse so you have people walking around carving pieces of steak for you. The steak was generally done to perfection depending upon how you like it but for some reason, at least half of it was very chewy. Even a bacon wrapped filet was chewy. The seasoning was quite good. A rib steak didn't come by until I was full and that's my favorite steak. I was a little disappointed at that.   The salad bar should not be the centerpiece of the meal. I expected more from the steak.",

    "text": "The food was OK. But the experience was not.  I called an hour before I went and asked if I needed a reservation and the girl who answered said, No. It's pretty slow tonight. (It was a Wednesday).  I get there 45 minutes later and I walk in and she asks, Do you have a reservation? I look around the restaurant and there are at least 20 empty tables. I said, NO. I just called and you said I didn't need one.  She said, Well, sorry, there's a 30 minute wait. Maybe you'd like to sit at the bar.   Because I was with a client I did.   The bartender didn't know how to make drinks. I ran three of the biggest clubs in Boston and know dozens of bartenders. This guy at the bar was simply not cut out to be a bartender in a fine dining establishment. His drinks, including Espresso Martinis, long islands and just simple vodka soda and cran were awful.   Needless to say, two other parties without reservations were sitting bored at the bar, waiting for  their tables.   I will never, ever go back to this place. And may not go to the one in Boston ever again (which I've been to many times) because of the sleazy hostess, (black girl), who was obviously ordered by incompetent management to send people in to the bar to pad the restaurant's daily take.  This restaurant screwed with the wrong person.",

The meat is all overly seasoned to the point that you really can't taste the meat.  Salt is pretty much the only flavor I tasted from the sirloin.  In addition, most cuts were over cooked.  I wanted to try the lamb and asked for the most rare piece available - it was pretty much well done.    One thing I will say is that the staff is very good.   Too bad they didn't have quality cooked food to serve.    For the price of our dinner for two, we could have had an amazing meal at over a dozen restaurants in Scottsdale for half the price.",

FYI lunch is $30 per person whereas dinner is $50 while having the same food!  We got seated quickly , and our server Derek was very friendly and we ordered our waters and the sauces (chimichurri, horse radish, and mint jelly) for our meats later. Before I got started with meats I had to get my favorites from the salad bar: pickles peppadew peppers, orange kale salad, smoked salmon, potato salad, and butter lettuce! The meat taste better with these sides, I can no longer only eat meat.  My favorite meats are the beef rib, ribeye, Parmesan pork, and bacon wrapped filet mignon. I tried some meats that was sub par.. Pineapple pork chop had no pineapple taste or scent, but it was tender. The bottom sirloin I had was super charred, and half was uneatable. Lastly, the garlic sirloin I got was completely burnt, but the gaucho was in such a hurry, I couldn't ask for a properly cooked one.  Despite the food quality complaints this time I still enjoyed it. Our server Derek was the bomb; he heard it was my birthday and got me a free desert!  Overall this place is well worth it for lunch price, just make sure that food coma doesn't get you afterwards!",

Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. I love the fact that you can have it from rare to well done. They give you a card that is red on one side and green on the other side. Red means no more meat for now and green means show me the meat.  What I recommend is to ask for a small piece of meat because there is so many to pick from and you want to be able to taste all of them.  I would leave my card on red but when someone with a meat skewer I did ask what it was and ask for a small slice.  I really did not eat from the salad bar, but I'd did look very good. I did eat plenty of the Brown sugar and black pepper bacon because it was so crispy and amazing and who doesn't like bacon. The Pao de Queijo is a warm, soft cheesy bread roll that is so yummy. Of course I did leave room for coffee and Creame Brulee that melts in your mouth.  Again come here with a big appetite and enjoy the amazing food and warm friendly staff. And no you can not take your leftovers home. They get 5 stars for great food and great service.",

    "text": "Let me first say I've gone to this particular Fogo for many years and usually had 4 star service. With how packed they usually are, it's virtually impossible for 5 stars. But this past weekend was ridiculous. And I don't typically write so much, but the details are important.  On Friday I made a reservation for 12 friends and kids for 8pm over the phone. My son's and my girlfriend's birthday dinner. We arrived promptly. The young hostess said I had no reservation and would have to wait about 1.5 -2 hours for a table that large. Keeping calm, I asked for a manager.   The manager was very nice and asked if I called the reservation in. I did, so she asked if I could show her my cell phone call log. Happily, I showed her that indeed called the day before, twice. She left for a few minutes and got us a table. Nice job, but beginning my evening with panic and frustration is not something anyone expects. On the way to the table I told her that we had 2 birthdays and she said they would each get birthday deserts on the house. Standard. Cool!  After seating us and taking our drink order, I went to the hostess stand waiting for 1 lagging friend. I spoke to the same hostess about the incident and she said it had been happening many times for the past few months. Obviously someone during the day was not doing their job. And she reiterated that we would be getting birthday deserts.   About half way through our meal we finally received our drinks, except for one of us. It took a while to flag down someone down who turned out to be another manager. He said no problem. At least another 15 minutes went by and no drink. Finally our server came by and said he'd get it. Another 15 went by, almost done meal now, and she got the drink. He had a \"could care less\" attitude and never apologized. He simply picked up their tab and crossed off the drink without telling them. And never asked the rest of us if we wanted additional drinks the entire night. But he never really came by the entire night, except to deal with the one drink.   Additionally we realized that for the 2 hours we were there, there were many meats that never made it our way. The more expensive meats. We were presented with Bottom and Middle Sirloin, and chicken 30 times, but filet, lamb and some others once or never. We had to ask for them to bring them over, which also took time.   Frustrated, but making the best of it and of course stuffed from the food, which was good, we paid and left. No desert ever made it over.   Having had office parties and other get togethers here over the years, I was really taken aback by all of the failures of the evening. They market themselves as a high-end restaurant, and should be judged that way. It may be sometime before I and talked into going back.",

    "text": "Having been to a few of these Brazilian style meat-sweat dinners, I've come to love that you can eat at these places like an upscale caveman. Continuously arriving charred proteins are a thing of beauty but, it doesn't come cheap. And as great as it is to be able to leave in a paleo-induced coma, what really disappointed me here was the lack of attention to detail. The meal alone will set you back about $50/person before tip, drinks, wine, dessert, etc. Throwing all of that in, it is easy to run a tab closer to about $100/person. For that, I expect a little more than just a meat fest. My biggest gripe is that for a place that earns a large dollar amount per person, I would think they could put a little more thought into their wine program. The list comes in a heavy leather-bound cover which is promising until you open it and read mainly mainstream, easily recognized names and labels. Also, none of them have vintage dates next to the choices so you have no idea what year you could actually get. This results in anyone who is the least bit interested in vintages to have to ask the staff. In doing so, I found out that the staff really has no clue about wine and they had to go to the cellar to sequentially check each one. 2 of the labels I inquired about they did not even have any more of in stock. The 3rd choice I inquired about was a year that was horrendous. Each time I made an inquiry, the server disappeared for about 5-10 minutes to check on it so by the time I made my 4th inquiry, I was about 30 min into this process and ready to drink Chateau du Shit if that was all they could produce. The fact that they have fairly mainstream labels, they don't list vintage years, they don't seem to put a lot of training time into their wine program with their staff, and they don't seem to keep their lists up to date with what they do and do no have in stock make me really question their commitment to the wine aspect of the meal. In many places, this is not a huge deal to me but when you are spending about $100/person, I expect the entire meal experience including the wine to be pretty darn good. While the meat was plentiful and tasty, the wine program sucked and the tab was pricey which is why I can't go more than 2 stars for this visit. I'll go again because I like to take down animals en masse as much as the next person but next time I think I'm going to stick to water.",

Must say food and service is great, the only knock I had is it's a bit pricey so definitely a special occasion place and all though they kept coming around with different types of meat non stop most of them were rare, very hard to get some well done meat. But I would still recommend this place to everyone to try at least once. I would also recommend you go on an empty stomach because it's pretty much all you can eat of every steak, chicken and pork they serve with an all you can eat salad and fruit bar and yes don't forget the bean and linguica soup.",

The meats offered were not up to par.  Having enjoyed good Argentinian Churrazcos and similar fares in other South American venues, what Fago the Chao offers, at least at their store in Scottsdale, is simply different cuts of flavorless  meats, very thinly sliced, served by comically attired \"gauchos\" servers.  The slices of the couple meats we requested were not thick enough to sink our teeth in to. Obviously, I was not expecting the 3/4\" slices of beef that usually are served in a chrrasqueria, with the choripan, morcillas, chimichurrry and other sort of accompaniment. I know I was not dining in Bnos. Airres but, I expected something slightly better.    We cut our experience off soon enough, paid our hefty bill and decided to write this restaurant off our list.",

The only bright side was the meat. If you don't care about ambiance, it's fine. But not worth it: Our first server came by when only half of our party was seated. She said \"you're ok with drinks?\" We had literally not even a glass of water. No drinks here!  I replied \"Ummm, no. We need drinks.\" She walked away. No answer.  The next server said \"You all know how this works? Great, go help yourself to the salad bar.\" Before I could explain that no, my spouse has never been here, He walked away too!  The meal went fine. Not great, very hurried. Shockingly, people were walking around in ripped jean shorts and flip flops. It was not what we'd hoped for. We were all dressed for date night.  The worst part? The ladies room hadn't been serviced in hours. 2 stalls were not usable. The handicapped stall had a DIRTY DIAPER in it. I warned the very nice but obviously frazzled manager and he was mortified.  4 people, 1 bottle of wine, 4 cocktails. $360. Nope.",

There isn't one meat that isn't tastier than the next. The trick is to just order meats that you like, make minimal trips to the salad bar. I had 4 filet mignons and snacked on meats and cheeses from the salad bar while waiting for more meat to arrive. Also, only order water. Drinking sodas or wines adds to your bill very quickly. The sides that they give you are delicious too. You have to master the art of eating all you want but not getting stuffed to the gills so you can walk out of there feeling full and not sick. It's totally worth a try. Everyone should experience this restaurant at least once in their life.",

    "text": "The food here is awesome, no doubt. But the customer service was really disappointing. Our server was initially rude and wouldn't let us reject a bottle of wine we didn't like after tasting it. Why pour us tastes if we can't say that we don't like it? But he honestly just seemed inexperienced. He also didn't seem to know the wine list very well. I was upset so I spoke to a manager and she was very nice and she remedied the situation by bringing us a different bottle of wine.  But then the service just continued to suck. The worst part of the night for me was when a waiter actually made a comment about how much meat I had on my plate as he was clearing plates. He said \"You're really saving up over there!\" or something like that. Really dude?! It's an all-you-can eat steakhouse. I was grabbing as much meat as I could because we came in around 8:30 (still plenty of time before closing) and we felt like we were being rushed out the entire time. We only saw most cuts once, and a few cuts never even made it to our table which is fine, but I'm going to take as much as I can get if I feel rushed. But it just felt really unprofessional for a waiter to make a comment about how much a customer is eating. Then we had several waiters come by our table and try to rush us out almost as soon as it was almost 10:00. I know that they close at 10, so obviously we needed to get going, but it was a little excessive. Don't waiters have sidework they could be doing instead of pestering customers? There were still other customers eating, we weren't the last to leave. I paid so the server would get out of my hair and he made some comment about \"letting the cashier get out of here\" and then he made another snarky comment about the cashier needing to leave after I had already paid when he came back to pick up my signed check. To make things worse, he actually snatched my half-full glass of wine as he was leaving. My boyfriend was shocked.  So, I feel like Fogo de Chao is the kind of place where everyone from every income bracket comes at least once for a special occasion. I'm a teacher, I don't make a lot of money, but I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and I wanted it to be special for once. I spent almost $200 on the check, which is more than I would ever normally spend at a restaurant and I feel like when you spend that much you want to be treated like any other customer. Other than the manager, who was nice, everyone on the staff was pretty rude to us. And we shouldn't have come at 8:30, but if you're going to be rude and rush people out the door, don't accept customers past 8:00.",

    "text": "Update: just to avoid confusion, the name Marco to avoid is the server, not the head Maitre'd (this guy is very nice)...  Normally I would give this 5 stars but last Friday was terrible, and I don't mean the food, it was the service from this one server.  I would say 2 words \"AVOID MARCO\", that's right, this douchebag is probably one of the worst server we have ever encountered (he was serving in the back for large parties I guess so just wanted to make sure in case there is another Marco there).  We came here to celebrate my birthday, if it wasn't for the company and great food, I would have probably not come back at all.  I would definitely come back because this is one of my favorite restaurant but next time I will make sure we don't get this rude server's table. Let me highlight some of the douchebag Marco's rudeness:  1. I ordered a bottle of wine to celebrate my b-day, typically when a server brings the wine, he or she will present the wine and open it so that we can taste it.  No, he just put the bottle of wine in front of me and left and said \"Here...\" and walked away.  My friends with me are like, what's up with that...He came back, and rudely asked me \"Do you want me to open that?\"  I just wanted to say \"Yes open it you douche :-)\" but I didn't, it was my b-day and I don't want to spoil everyone's dinner.  Wait, not done yet, after he opened the wine, he just laid down cork in front of me and then walked away again.  I mean really?? didn't even bother asking if I wanted to taste it first grrrr.  So I proceeded to pour the wine to my friends and then he saw me and asked \"Do you want me to pour it?\".  Really, are you kidding me??  I mean c'mon, tell me this guy is not a douche?!  2. So my wife asked me if they're doing the summer feast special, which I'm not sure, so I begin to ask douchebag Marco and he explained that it was for everyone and that I didn't have to remind him also he asked me \"So do you have any questions??\".  That minute, I almost was going to really punch this guy, how rude, it's like I don't have the right to ask question.    3. So we finished our food, and we gathered to take some pictures.  My wife was taking the picture and we told her to ask any server.  Unfortunately, douchebag Marco walked in carrying just a tray with empty drinks that he just cleaned up on another table...my wife politely asked him if he could take our picture, you know what he said?? \"Why don't you take some pictures and I will come back..\"  What the F!@#...seriously, he couldn't just set down the drinks for a sec and take the picture?  I hope the manager can read this, because this douchebag \"MARCO\" needs to go back to server training and learn some manners and etiquette and how to serve and respect the customers.  Next time you go to Fogo, 2 words \"AVOID MARCO\" a.k.a douchebag",

It's going to take me awhile to get over this breach of trust, but I'm going to try to deal with this speed bump in our relationship.  After eating here, I am shocked that they manage to fill seats.  The restaurant is filthy.  The ambiance is best described as if Olive Garden and Chilis Too had a lovechild--which would be fine, if it wasn't $50/person.  I would have been happy to pay what the experience warranted--somewhere around $7.99 (excluding tax and drinks).  So to receive the bill (originally with extra drinks charged to our tab, which we asked them to correct) and pay $150 dollars for two adults who had one drink a piece, added insult to injury.  I would have rather lit $130.00 on fire, taken the other $20 and gone to Chick fil A and had a more enjoyable night.   More importantly, the quality of the food itself was deplorable.  Everything was dry.  For the parmesan crusted pork, they use the kind of parmesan that tastes like the scraps off the parmesan factory floor--the kind that doesn't have to be refrigerated, costs about $1.99 for one pound of it at the grocery store? Anyone know what I'm talking about?  The buffet was disgusting.  The food looked old.  The food tasted old.  I mentally prepared myself for food poisoning as I nibbled on a piece of cheese.   It was honestly one of the most bizarre dining experiences we've ever had.  My guest and I kept looking around the room in awe that this many people were paying 50 dollars/head for this quality of food and service.  We discussed leaving after sitting down and getting our drinks, but didn't pull the trigger.  We deeply regret our decision to stay.   I think one-star reviews should be given sparingly, reserved for when an establishment is truly deserving.  I tried to find one redeeming aspect of the whole night, and I couldn't.  I won't give two stars for a consistent one-star experience.  Go to Ruth's Chris. Go to Mastros. Hell, go to Applebees.  Just don't go here.",

The meat is always fresh and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and if you don't watch it they will try to put you in a food comma. Make sure to pace yourself and remember green means go and red means stop. Do not feel bad to flip it red, or you will not have enough room for desert. The molten chocolate cake is to die for and you have to try some Xingu Gold Beer even if your not a beer drinker this beer is awesome. If you are a beer drinker try the Xingu Black Beer. I have been to Fogo de Chao several times and I have never been let down. If you have young kids and cannot find a sitter I would suggest lunch with the kids and a nice romantic dinner with your spouse. Please remember this is a classy, romantic restaurant so don't be surprised by the price. It will cost more then $75 plus tip depending on what your drinking for a party of two. Remember quality is never cheap. I have recommended Fogo de Chao to several people and I will continue to recommend Fogo de Chao to anyone who asks for a nice place to take their spouse or their date.",

Other  Brazilian places I have been too have had everything from Ostrich to Antelope as part of the meat selections. This place had beef,pork,chicken and lamb in various cuts. The deserts were excellent too, but not included in the cost for the meal. Deserts were just under $10 each. Everything served here was excellent.

First off we started over to the salad bar, which I thought was going to be a diversion so I wouldn't eat so much meat. Everything was so fresh and tasty that I just didn't care. I did not go nuts over the salad bar but did help myself, as meat was what I was really after. Then you turn over the card so it is showing green. I guess it's a metaphor for the money you're about to spend. Anyway, that didn't matter. We were besieged by matadors carrying long scewers of meat. They cut off pieces to order and boy was it good. There must have been a dozen different people racing from table to table hacking and slicing their way through tons of the finest crafted meats I have ever tasted...beef, pork, lamb, and chicken. I liked the bottom sirloin, filet mignon (wrapped in bacon), house special (sirloin), and pork ribs. It was all really good, but when I say I enjoyed the above, it was just that those things were so beyond my expectations that I just had to mention them.   These guys all went out of their way to make our dinner a dining extravaganzal? experience. It was at once delicious and entertaining. We-will-be-back!!!! Speaking of being back, check out ol' Wichita's webpage to hear some good old industrial strength classic country music. Wichitacountry dot com. I do it all alive and in real time with no help from anybody else. Thanks.",

    "text": "I ate my weight in meat. The selection is great here as is the quality. They have a salad bar as well that is great (although I'd love it if we could have our salads tossed for us). The salad par has lettuce, around 6 or 7 dressings, great fresh Parmesan cheese, a selection of deli meats, and more! For the steaks, what didn't I try? Filet mignon, filet mignon with bacon, bottom sirloin, top sirloin, lamb chops, their house special, you name it, they had it! I call this \"fancy and expensive fast food\" because you can be eating high quality meat within minutes of sitting down! The servers always come around, but sometimes they come in waves which I do not like. Also, you feel kind of pressured to eat which can be seen as a downfall to some people. Overall, it is a great meal and a lot of fun! For a more intimate steak dinner at this price though, I'd be more likely to recommend Ruth Chris, Mastros, or Flemings.",

The salad bar will minimal...not a lot of goodies, toppings, soup, or anything the others have.  The meat...had little if any flavor and some of the filets were so fatty I couldn't choke them down.  I am totally a meat and potatoes kind of girl and I was bummed.  My husband was sorely disappointed as well.  And then the price...higher than most other places, but we were ok with that going in to it, but not now after eating there.  Needless to say it was ok, but we won't be returning.",

All I can say is if you're not a fan of red meat or have a cholesterol problem don't bother. The ambiance is not as format as I assumed it to be due to the location and hype. Although, the meat and presentation is great. Anything you want sent right to your table and cooked however you would like. Just don't leave your card on the green for too long otherwise you will have more meat than you can handle.  On the other hand, the specialty drinks are good. I don't recall the name of it but they served a traditional Brazilian drink that was wonderful. Not as strong for my liking but good. The salad bar was great too. Everything was fresh and there sure was a lot to choose from. Probably the best I have seen in a while.",

    "text": "Meat coma.  Prepare for a meat coma.  Last night my husband and I celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary.  After much debate on where we were going to celebrate Fogo won our votes.  We've visited another similar style restaurant in Ahwatukee so we knew what we were in for - or did we?  Fogo last night was very happily a different experience from the last time we did a Brazilian steak house.  This was upscale and so much more busy.  We made reservations on line and while we were five minutes late - it wasn't even an issue.  For the record we had an incredible time and I guess the next few things are just minor but I think would have added another star.  My hubby is chatty and can strike up conversation with anyone.  But the staff was not so much into it.  They didn't engage his quick little one liners and didn't feel obliged to \"listen\" to anything.  The expeditors were a little more willing but not by much.  I was seriously starting to get nervous by how fast everyone moves @ the restaurant.  So fast in fact a collision happened right in front of us.  Plates went everywhere.  The hubby tried (for the record this was his third attempt) to engage a gaucho about how they cook the meat - this gentleman looked @ Josh and said \"hmmm I dunno\" - I got the feeling he didn't understand what was being asked of him.  He just knew to cut the meat off the skewer and continue on.  Perhaps that's what they have been advised to do.  Not sure.  It was just awkward.  Everything was good.  The cherry peppers were delish (my first time) all of the meat was delish.  Not very seasoned but good.  The purity was awesome.  The salad bar was great.  I made the best Caesar salad I've had in a while.  The mozz and parm were FANTASTIC!  Hubby loved the little bread basket. The wait staff said that they were told what goes into it but not so much how to make them.  (you see a pattern here with the chatty)  :)  At the end of the night when we could take no more we were approaching comaville we waited for our staff person to bring the check.  This is what confuses me.  Who are we tipping.  The gauchos, the really sweet gal that never let my water go empty, the cutie that \"crumbed\" our table?  The gal previously mentioned asked if we had received our check.  And then went to find it.  When everyone was running around furiously this is where we waited the most?  Hubby says that it's almost nice to not feel like they are rushing us out the door.  But when we wanted to leave - well, we waited.  All in all it was a very successful anniversary.  We will be back I'm sure.",

In today's economy I insist that if I am going to spend good money I should be rewarded in return. The meats are so delicious...you can choose to taste them all but I love the picanha and I ask the waiter to just keep bringing this wonderful cut. It literally melts in your mouth. While most people prefer well done you would be doing a disservice to yourself  to eat picanaha well done. All Brazilians eat  picanha  either  rare or medium rare. I prefer medium rare..It's the best meat I've ever tasted.  The staff is so attentive and courteous-they really stand out. I love to tip them generously because they really deserve it. Not like most places I've been to. The salad bar is delicious. I would love it if they'd incorporate sushi like most other brazilian steakhouses in NYC but I won't hold it against them.  Be sure to go hungry. The atmosphere is not too uppity and not too casual just a really pretty elegant experience. I have been here with the girls, with the family. It's great for all occassions.  You won't be disappointed with the food or service. Love this place!",

The salad bar is great and all the meat was perfectly cooked.  Since it was my first time here and I was so enamored with all of the beautiful cuts running around, I didn't slow down, and relax as much as I should have.   On the other hand, Manny Ramirez of the LA Dodgers was sitting at the table directly next to us so that was pretty cool.  The bacon wrapped fillet was the best bite I had all night.  I kept taking more every time that particular Gaucho came around.  The staff here is excellent accomadating my request for rice at no charge.  They also have a beautiful chimichurri sauce that you can ask for as well.  My only gripe of the meal, and I do mean only, was the fact that they charged me $18 for a glass of lemoncello at the end of the meal.  That is ridiculous, especially if my father in laws Grand Marnier was only $6.50.  The lemoncello was a $28 bottle, so I can't comprehend where they got the nerve to charge so much.  Other than that, Saud, Fogo de Chao! Wonderful job on your fabulously different take on the classic steak house.",

    "text": "This is by far the best restaurant in Scottsdale especially for the one cut price of $42.50. After the hostess seats you the waiter/waitress will come by and explain how the system works. First, you can go to the huge salad bar and pick from the many vegetables and they even had my favorite peppers, Peppadews. After you are finished eating your salad, you can flip the card they give you to green which means that you want meat. Someone might ask if would like a fresh plate and then a gaucho (the person that has the meat on a skewer) will come by your table and tell what kind of meat is on the skewer and ask you if you would like some. I recommend the fillet mignon wrapped in bacon or the top sirloin. Excellent customer service and the best I have in a Scottsdale restaurant in a long time. Throughout the meal fried banana, fried polenta, and mashed potatoes are replenished. You must be careful when picking wines or liquor because the price can add up and its where they make the big bucks. After you are finished with your meal a liquor cart comes around and the person will ask you if you would like something. They have port to expensive wines to cognac. For dessert I would recommend the papaya creme if your not an avid chocolate fan. It is not too sweet and taste a little like frozen yogurt. However, if you are a choclatier, then I would go for the chocolate molten cake. If you want to go it is best to make a reservation because it's a very popular place.",

A tip that i must pass on is to request the beef ribs. They do not come around with them unless by request so it is important to ask. I though all of the meat was good ( except for the chicken which was dry) but after having the beef ribs nothing else compared to it. They are the reason i will certainly go back. Now the service is really good because they work as a team but I do not know if i love this aspect because you kind of lose the personal feel that you get with having an actual server. What did bother me a bit though was that we had 830 reservations and after dining for about a half an hour one of the female bussers made it very apparent she wanted us to leave because they close at nine. However, the restaurant still had many tables left in it and if they close at nine they should not accept 830 reservations because when you are paying $50 a person you should be entitled to more than a half an hour. I was also not impressed by the decor of the restaurant or layout, it was just sort of blah. The food and service will definitely bring me back though and it is worth checking out",

There were at least 2 beef dishes that were OVERLY season with salt that made it unbearable to eat.   We had our green signs up and it was like nobody came to us. We noticed they worked the back of the room more and left side. We were seated right in front of the salad bar.  Getting the sides were difficult as well. They didn't come as freely or as needed as well.  The manager came over to us and we asked if we could try the filet mignon. That took like 15 minutes for someone to come over to us.",

Came in with a party of four for restaurant week. Two of us opted for the restaurant week price ($44) while the other two chose the all you can eat option. Basically the difference is the restaurant week option does not allow you to choose from the prime meats (ribeye, filet mignon, lamb) and with the restaurant week price, you get dessert.   From outside, it looked very fancy. When we walked in, we were immediately surprised at how casual and bright it was inside. It reminded me of some of the buffet spots in Las Vegas. I was disappointed because I expected a more intimate setting comparable to high end restaurants. We were immediately seated and made our way to the salad bar. None of the options here were particularly great- I got some charcuterie (cheese, meats), potato salad (I could name a million other places that make better potato salad), caesar salad, green beans and white rice.   The meat itself wasn't anything great. Some of the meat choices were bland, and we all agreed that we could make way better steak dishes at home. My boyfriend snuck me a piece of beef ribs and they tasted like they were dumped in a bowl of salt. They came around with other side dishes like fried bananas (these ones were good), delicious polenta and mashed potatoes. The service was great - in fact they repeatedly offered me the prime meat even if I was under the impression that I wasn't allowed to have any of it. For dessert, we had the NY cheesecake and chocolate mousse which we enjoyed.   Our bill, with drinks and a bottle of wine totaled to almost $300. I kicked myself because I spent so much money and came out of there disappointed. I unfortunately will not come back.",

I planned a date night with hubby but kept our destination a surprise.   When hubby saw where we were he was excited to try it out.   We both started with their traditional Brazilian drink (I don't recall the name) hubby getting his plain and I went with the strawberry hibiscus flavor.   Drinks took quite some time to come,  but they were busy so we were fine with that.  Hubby really enjoyed his drink but mine was so strong I couldn't drink it.  I gave it to hubby to drink and he said it was significantly stronger than his.      If you've never been to a rodizeo before,  they typically have a large salad and side dish bar you can help yourself to and Fogo De Chao was no different.   I thought they had a nice selection of salads but was extremely disappointed in the sides bar.  It consisted of hard, dry white rice,  a stewed bean dish (which wasn't bad), dried yucca to top it and a small pot of lentil soup.  I didn't try the soup so I can't comment on how it was.    Next,  they have a small coaster on the table that is red on one side and green on the other.   When you're ready for your main course you flip it to the green side and the servers walking around with assorted meats will come by with their offerings.  In addition,  the main course comes with bananas,  garlic mashed potatoes and crispy polenta.   I'm not a polenta girl,  but hubby enjoyed it.   We both really liked the bananas which were well cooked and slightly crispy.  The mashed potatoes were also good but we chose not to fill up on them.   Our meal also came with small cheesy bread but I found it to be dry and inedible (hubby didn't try it).  The assorted meats that came around were good,  but not great.   Hubby and I prefer our meat on the med rare to rare side and almost all of the meat we were offered was extremely well done.     Since we came for restaurant week,  our dinners also came with dessert and we had the option of cheesecake,  chocolate mousse cake or tres leches cake.  Hubby and I both opted for the tres leches cake which was very good.   It was sweet and creamy without being too heavy after such a large meal.  I really enjoyed my dessert as did hubby.   Overall it wasn't a bad meal by any means but it wasn't even close to as good as the other rodizios I've been to in the past (and they were less than half the price of our discounted restaurant week meal).  I'm glad we were able to try some place new and that hubby got to experience a rodizio.   We both had a nice night but I don't see us returning to Fogo De Chao anytime soon.   It's possible that we caught them on a bad night (they were extremely busy and it was restaurant week) but it wasn't the experience we'd hoped it would be.",

Don't know what happened  but the meat was not the best quality we have had, the servers very serious, no smiles. The young lady who received us as hostess was not that nice, seemed a bit condescending. We did have a reservation. Our server seemed to be there by obligation and that reflected on his demeanor in serving us. I felt, unwelcome, and quite frankly did not enjoy our family outing. I have been to other Fogo de Chao restaurants and this has been the only time I have had this negative impression.  I feel sad having to write this about them, hopefully they take my notes as motivation to better. I don't think we will be returning anytime soon.  Sometimes the greatness of a business is  in how they better themselves.",

Service: Our waitress that took care of us the most was Carina. She was one of the best waitresses we have ever had anywhere but the rest of the staff was great too. Carina you are awesome!   Atmosphere: Pretty laid back and definitely not pretentious which I appreciate. It has the steakhouse vibe with Brazilian swagger and flare (love the pants)!  Overall: Came here after I made a comment after seeing the commercial for our anniversary and it's by far my new favorite restaurant! Thank you Fogo!!",

    "text": "I tell you what, the only reason I came to Fogo is that I got a gift card for Christmas. So I made a reservation on Open Table finally and Fogo was our choice tonight. Its a protein night.   After walking through two sets of double door, we were greeted by the hostesses. To the left is the bar and to the right is the dining area. It's only 5:30 but already packed. Good thing I made reservations. Very modern looking with lots of people running around.   Right as we're seated, one of the servers explained how everything works here. All your pre-meat is all you can eat at the buffet table which has salads, cheese, veggies, and other goodies. I have to say it's a unique buffet cause haven't really seen this type of stuff at other places.   For you meat which includes beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. They give everyone at the your table a card which is turned to RED. When you want meat turn the card to green and the guys with meat will come by your table and slice your preferred cut. They even give you your own pair of tongs to grab the sliced meat.   So I loved to pre-meat meal. Loved the smoked salmon, Caesar salad, different cheese, prosciutto, and grilled veggies. Just make sure you don't get to full on this cause you still have your meat.   The meat is great. You can pick what you want. They just ask you if you would like whatever they are serving and if you want rare, medium or well done. Saw beef tenderloin, lamb, chicken, pork chops, sausage. It's all good. I enjoyed all the meats. I even saw some bacon wrapped too. So they got everything.   The service was excellent. This is no joke. They had at least 3 different servers helping us and others filling our water glasses, exchanging our dirty plates and multiple people ask how everything was. Even had a Manager ask us if we needed anything special or meat and was willing to bring out for us. What stood out was my son and wife asked for tea and then wanted a hot water refill so with the new hot water they also go new cups and tea bags too. No questions asked but what was surprising was my son stomach wasn't feeling good at the beginning and the servers were helping him find a bubbly drink to help calm his stomach. He got a Pellegrino with mango something in it and it did help calm it down. Very nice. Shoutout to Karina and I think Bryan. They are all great  We were stuffed but we still have to try their dessert (FYI it's extra cost). So many options. We went for the Key Lime pie and the Papaya cream. Loved the Papaya cream. It was vanilla ice cream mixed with Papaya. Very smooth. The key Lime pie was different than others but was very good too.   We loved it at Fogo. It's pretty expensive but  comes with so much. All you can eat meat and sides. Oh yea forgot, they bring to you table this cheese bread. It's so go when hot. Also bring mashed potatoes and fried bananas.    So great atmosphere with friendly service that goes out of their way to serve you. Food is great. It's a meat paradise. We enjoyed and will be back again for another meat coma.",

    "text": "Ohhhh my meat goodness! My sister and I planned Valentine's Dinner for our husbands this year and picked Fogo De Chao. I am so glad we did because the food was absolutely amazing. WE ALL LOVE MEAT but didn't expect this place to be as meatlicious as it was. It's a Brazilian all you can eat experience! It is definitely on the fancier side, being in downtown Scottsdale, I would recommend dressing nicer if you go for dinner. From what I understand though, they do not have or enforce a dress code. When you walk in the restaurant is very open and loud. It has a ton of tables throughout the space with an extra banquet/dining area in the back. The walls have a bunch of different paintings, wines, and fancy decor. It's all tied together with beautiful chandeliers. If you are expecting a quiet evening, I do not recommend coming here. The atmosphere here is a little more upbeat, smiling faces, people talking and people walking around. When it comes to food, you can order something off their menu or order the buffet. If you order the buffet, you start out at the salad bar, and the meat is brought around to each table on a skewer. They have a variety of meats to choose from, so they have many waiters walking around with different meats for you to try. They come to your table and cut you off a slice of your liking. Valentine's night they had over 17 different meats to try. I love that they had a little cardboard heart card to use, so the people with the meat knew to come to your table to offer you more. Green means \"more please\" and red means \"need a break.\" I would say the Lamb and the Filet Mignon were my favorites. Each meat was moist, tender and full of flavor! On top of stuffing yourself with meat, you get a side of mashed potatoes, fried banana, and sweet potatoes. Be prepared for the price tag, but well worth it for an all you can eat, top-notch experience. My husband and I will be back soon!",

My date and I followed the server through the busy dining room to the very, very back empty room, next to a door that was cracked open. We sat down, and moments later, someone comes up and says \"we are going to move you in the front - you will get better service up there anyways\" I was highly confused by the initial placement of our seating (away from other guest) and the statement. I looked past it and sat down at our new location in the dining hall next to other guest. During our dinner, I felt like it was a mixture of pop up ads and sales guys. Besides the normal \"do you want this wrapped in bacon\" at all different occasions, sales waiters came to our table and offered to sale us a $12 shot, asked to sign up for an email club, asked if we wanted seafood on ice, asked if we wanted a bottle. It was honestly unbelievable. There wasn't enough time in between to have intimidate conversations before being interrupted again. At the end, I paid $135 and wished I made better arrangements. When you eat at Texas de Brazil- you do not get bombarded while eating so not sure why my date and I were bombarded here.",

    "text": "This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but I just wanted to give an honest review. We came here for the first time last night for a friend's birthday and I woke up this morning still feeling a little ripped off by the experience.  Pros:  - The staff was amazing! If this review was based on the staff ONLY it would absolutely be five stars. They were consistently coming around with food for us and were very proactive with our needs. - There was a lot of variety. We did the full experience and I was very surprised by the variety of the meat we received. They also kept loading us up with bread and mashed potatoes (which, sad to say were my favorite part of the meal). Cons - Most of the meat we received was overcooked. I am a firm believer in cooking beef medium rare. Even when we asked for medium rare cuts, more often than not it was medium well or well done. Twice they came around with Filet Mignon and twice I was severely disappointed by how overcooked it was. Especially since we paid extra specifically for that cut. By the end of the meal, I just had so much waste because I was constantly on the hunt for better cooked meat.  - The price. Obviously, we went here knowing we were going to spend $50+ per person. The problem is it really wasn't worth it. I would have much rather gone to a steak house where I could order my own steak portion and be guaranteed to get it correctly cooked.  - No happy hour in the main dining room. We got there early so we had a drink at the bar first before dinner. I ordered the Alamos Malbec that was on happy hour for $6. I was sad to learn that HH prices are not available in the dining area. My $6 glass of wine became $11.5. This only bothered me because I know that Alamos is $9ish a bottle at the store. I get the need to markup glasses and bottles, but that markup seems steep.    Overall, I would still encourage people to try it out for their selves maybe once. It's a cool concept and it was fun having the meat cut directly at the table. You're definitely paying for the experience more than the quality of the food. At the end of the day, it just felt more like an overpriced buffet to me.",

There you could get a delicious meal with unlimited food for $5-10. Just amazing. We are very lucky to have a decent churrascaria right here in CdA, which is unusual for a small US town, though you will pay way more than $10! The food is pretty authentic and tasty, though I've yet to score chicken hearts in three visits there. Have to admit that the salad bar is more American-like, and not too special. The service is very good and it's a fun experience. If you are unsure, go for lunch which is quite a bit cheaper than dinner, but with less variety in cuisine. I have to say that I liked their older location on Front St. better than the current Riverstone place, but it still has a nice atmosphere.",

Not because it was made poorly, but because it was simply a disgusting recipe. And to top it all off, their prices are highway robbery. My bill came out to $180.00 for two people (each with only one bar drink) after the tip. Absolutely never going back to this place again.",

I was hoping it would be a little darker and more ethnic with fire and dimmer lighting but the setting was still nice. I guess they need to see your table is why! White table cloth open floor plan style. It was super crowded but it was a Saturday night so it was a little crazy when the meat started coming and everyone was seated so close to each other but once it died down it was very nice. They are very on top of service and getting you food quickly. Never had a moment where we needed much! All in all a great time with great food and an experience everyone should try once if not more! :)",

    "text": "Came here this evening for my birthday and it was a great experience and yummy. I have been here a couple times before during AZ Restaurant Week and it has never let me down. Came with some people who had never been so it was a new and exciting experience for them. Our waiter, Brian was very attentive and made sure we had drinks flowing and the cuts of meat we wanted brought around. We opted for the full experience. The salad bar is always a good starter, but go light on it as to not fill up. The veggies are fresh and the array of toppings and dressings are good. I love the smoked salmon and deli meat and cheese selection as well. The salad bar also offers rice and soup which is a nice addition to the meal. And those cheesy bread puffs are so delicious. Sides of mashed potatoes and fried bananas are also refillable. I almost fill up on those alone but have to stop myself. Pro Tip, just flip your card green and leave it green so the meat is always flowing to you and just say no if you don't want the particular cut that comes by and wait until they bring around the filet and ribeye (or cut of your choice). You can also ask the waiter for a particular cut to come by and they'll get it sent over. If you come on your birthday as I did, it comes with a free dessert, also sign up for their email list and put in your birthday and you'll get a $25 off coupon for the full experience. The full dinner experience is well worth the $50 price, but even if you come for lunch, it's $25 (doesn't come with some of the prime cuts of meat) but still worth it. It's definitely a fun experience if you haven't tried it and love meat.",

One thing that we were confused about was that I ordered the full churrasco, and my husband just ordered the market table because he doesn't eat much red meat. One of the servers looked at us with such disgust when we ordered that and he realized we weren't both getting the full. Isn't it our right to choose what we want on the menu? He allowed seemed like he was going to ask us to leave or force us to order something we didn't want.  Everyone else was super kind and did a great job. We were just really taken aback by the one server.  Food was ok. I really only liked the prime sirloin, I would probably just get that next time. My husband enjoyed the market table and said there was a good selection. I actually would rather save my money and eat at a local restaurant instead for better food.",

    "text": "Our company opened the new year with a bang, or in my case, a severe migraine!  Because our customers are always open and are always working, they demand that we be available as well - even the principals of the company. Holidays are irrelevant as their lack of observance is relative to hemisphere.  I didn't want to go out in the rain, which is unusual for me, but my Beloved was willing to drive wherever to take care of her honey! She figured that great pieces of meat and dessert would quell my migraine. Oh, how she knows me so well.  Since I don't drink alcohol, this would have to do in my case.  A secondary agenda was that I was looking for a nice, upscale place to gift 3 couples that really helped us with our favored charity drives over the holidays. These couples were so instrumental in greatly benefiting two schools for the blind and underprivileged children. And I figured Fogo de Chao would be a great venue to show our appreciation, and present them with their gifts.  With that in mind, my wife navigated through the rain towards this restaurant. She had never eaten here, and the last time that I was here was in 2010 - which is eons ago in restaurant standards.  We were greeted at the door by the selfie taking groups who insisted on such prolonged poses. The effect, as annoying this would've been under any other circumstances, was completely reversed. My wife marveled as to the festive atmosphere that greeted us.  We were promptly seated, and began to partake of the scrumptious dinner that was presented to us.  The salad bar is simply amazing. Except for the green beans which didn't taste that fresh, everything else was just marvelous. I particularly liked the pickled cucumbers, and the massive asparagus (I am an asparagus fan), and the poached eggs.  Additionally, the caramelized bananas and the garlic mashed potatoes were simply sublime.  Then came the meats. My goodness, I thought I went to meat heaven - the ones that we tried were simply savory. I would truly recommend bringing an appetite when dining here, as you will be reaching to flip that chip in no time if you have any less of an appetite.  The Piece de Resistance  for me was the flan for dessert. It was superb. Not too sweet and not too tart. Just perfect. My wife had the chocolate mousse cake, but she didn't like it, and only took a few bites and set it aside.  All in all, at the end of our dining experience, prior to settling the bill, my migraine had completely subsided. Everyone was happy, until I went to the bathroom after settling the bill.  Let me explain...  The bill was $146, and I paid $200 in cash, and my change was approximately $53 and some change.  Because of their server pool, and the perpetual hand off between servers and a lack of interaction with regard to specific details, there had arisen some confusion and miscommunication as to whether or not we paid.  This was exacerbated by the fact that yours truly's policy of tipping for good server is around 30-75+ percent. So, I gave our servers a $50 tip. I left it at the table, and I excused myself and instructed my wife to hand it to one of the servers.  As I returned, and were about to leave, one of our servers (there were several of them) stopped my wife as she was walking through the tables and asked her if she had paid her bill as she was handed this $50 in the bill fold.  Unfortunately, this particular server stopped her and asked this question in the midst of various tables for many of the guests to hear. It was simply uncouth and tactless. Then when my wife clarified that it was a tip, she just proceeded on without any appreciation or gratitude.  Needless to say my wife was mortified, and I had to hear her venting in the car all the way home. And my migraine had summarily returned.  Sadly, on the way out, I was actually going to inquire as to how I could purchase a gift certificate for the three couples that I had previously mentioned. But, after this incident, I will continue to look elsewhere in the myriad of wonderful places throughout the valley.  If this seems petty, it is important to point out that the last time that we encountered such an untoward display was in an upscale Italian restaurant called Iannuzzi, over two decades ago.   Ironically, the issue there was also tip related. This happens so rarely that it really perturbs my wife, who never likes attention drawn to her; especially in an embarrassing manner such as this.  This establishment just needs to work on its communications, and professionalism that should be in keeping with their upscale status. Hence, why I only gave it a 4 star rating, when it really should've been a 5 star. Of course, if my wife had her druthers, it would've been a 1 star but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  To be succinct, the only proper and appropriate response from that server would've simply been... \"Thank You!\"  Enough Said.   Time to get a prescription for Percocet! Not!",

Marco made special recommendations (taking my food allergies into consideration) and accommodations; server Vanessa took great care of us, and brought me a list of allergens in regards to each of the food items offered. Many other dining establishments I have been to have a diminished amount of options available, or the server is unsure if soy is present, or in what capacity (ie - an ingredient that can be omitted vs a marinade that has been infused). Marco even offered to prepare each of the meat options that typically are prepared with ingredients containing soy in a different way so that I could still enjoy the variety. They have a red/green card system for when you would like to have the Gauchos bring around meats and you can visit the buffet as often as you would like.  From appetizers to salads, veggies to meats, breads and fruits, and even desserts... all was fresh and flavorful.  And Marco prepared the best (and prettiest) Chilean Sea Bass with a mango topping plated with asparagus for me, along with the freshest creme brulee I have ever tasted. Bellisimo!!",

    "text": "Went in for lunch, which, I think is the far better value, as the food is the same as dinner...just $20 cheaper.  First off - atmosphere and layout - very nice.   We were seated promptly, explained the process, and asked for drink orders.  BF had a back and forth with our server on the beer selection, ordered one the server recommended, and then...it never materialized.  It's very hard to flag a server in there, as once you're seated, you pretty much have the meat guys running the show, or, you go to the salad bar.  Anyhoo, we lost interest in it, and it didn't show up on the check, but still...serious fail to miss it, as again, they had a discussion over it.  To the food...all of the pork or chicken items were seriously dried out.  The ribs were unpalatable, the bacon-wrapped chicken was horrible. The beef were better choices, but not great.  We prefer our beef medium rare, though most of what came to the table was medium to well-done.  Some of the cuts were very bland, while others were strongly seasoned.  The salad bar...for all the ravings on here, I expected something fantastic.  It was OK.  The \"meats\" were the same you'd find pre-sliced at Safeway, the cheese selection had three choices, the veggies all looked very fresh, however.  The cheese bread they bring at the beginning was totally yummy.  Had about 4 of them myself.  lol  Overall, if you're looking to just eat copious amounts of meat, and you have little regard for quality and preparation, then you'll love this place just for the all-you-can-eat factor.  Otherwise, you'll likely be disappointed.",

All the staff members work together as a team and it made the experience wonderful. You need a new clean plate? Their on it! You want something you havn't see come out yet? No problem they'll go get it. Another cocktail? well they have someone coming around with a mobile cart to bring you one! I was 100% satisfied with the customer service end.  The food was pretty good. Now don't get me wrong it was delicious. However I am comparing it to another Brazilian steakhouse I've been to in San Francisco and for around the same price their food is EXCELLENT. Now the customer service on the other hand is not as good. I wasn't overly impressed with the salad bar,  I would probably skip it next time I go and just focus on stuffing my face with more meat!  Bottom line: Great food and exceptional customer service. I would come here again in a heartbeat.",

My daughter and friends took me to Fogo last night for my birthday.  We enjoyed right up until the bill came.  Some insensitive, ignorant waiter wrote a very derogatory message on my daughter's ticket. When we saw the comment we were appalled, disgusted and extremely angry.  It is unbelievable and inexcusable that such a comment come from anyone at any establishment, but from this upscale restaurant it is even more appalling!  How dare he!!  The management was insincere and handled the situation very poorly.  We asked that the guilty party be brought to the table for a formal apology to my daughter.  That never happened although we stayed and waited at the table for quite a long time.  Instead the GM offered her a gift card to come back for another visit.  Was he some kind of crazy?!  We will never return to this restaurant!!  My daughter has been hurt beyond belief, and is dealing with the emotional fallout this incident has caused her.    How about some harassment and sensitivity training Fogo!!!",

    "text": "In anticipation of what may be my last lunch at Fogo de Chao for a long time (a change in my work location will make this an untenable lunch option), a decided to write my review of this place *before* eating a meal there.  Once upon a time, Fogo e Brasa was the churrascaria in Phoenix.  It was OK from what I remembered.  It became Brazillian Bull, and more recent memories seem to conjure up images of salt shakers, salt flats, salt water, salt, rock salt, and even more salt.  Before I ever tried Fogo de Chao, I thought BB was a reasonable option due to its lower price, but after trying Fogo de Chao (which I actually like to pronounce as correctly as I can: \"shoum\" with a very soft 'm'), I decided that it would actually be a waste of money, and calorie budget, to go with the cheaper place.  So, why is Fogo de Chao so good?  Two things: the food and the service.  The salad bar and sides are great.  I always like to get a few of their fancy cheeses and the smoked salmon, and a few other odds and ends before my meal.  The Pao de Queijo is delicious.  It's OK to budget space for one or two pieces.  The meats are all good.  You do have to be careful, though: if you don't pay attention, you may find yourself with some chicken on your plate, which can take up valuable gastric real estate better used on a good cut of beef or their leg of lamb (my personal favorite).  They also cook them nice and bloody - every once in awhile, they undershoot it a bit, and the sheep jumps off the plate and runs away.  Best of all, they're seasoned well - even if you get stuck with a mostly-outside piece, it's not too salty.  The only complaint I have is that they never bring me the leg of lamb often enough.  And the guarana is $4.  A little steep for a can of soda, no?  Really, this is quite the fine establishment, and a worthy place to spend ~$40 on lunch.",

Don't fill up on the salad bar though, because once you turn over your coaster from red to green, your place will be FULL of succulent meats from tasty animals! Chicken, beef, lamb, pork OH MY! Make sure you are good and hungry before arriving. All of the cuts of meat could be cooked the way you want it (rare-well). We went here to celebrate my boyfriend's college graduation and the servers brought him out a fancy and free dessert.   You can get all the good cuts of meat and salad bar at lunchtime for less money than dinner time. This place is pretty cut and dry. Nothing special except the flavor of the meat, though for that only, I give it 4 stars.",

I will say the service staff and salad bar at this location are top notch.  The salad bar has several options and does not have any of the mess associated with your usual salad bar at restaurants.  Reservations for dinner are pretty much a must but while we were there I saw a little of everything in terms of dress.  Don't feel like you have to get dressed to the 9's at this place if you are not up for it.  The meat is good but after a while it all sounds and starts to taste the same to me.  At a little over $50 bucs per head it can get expensive quick.  I have no issue paying over a hundred dollars for my wife and I to eat out but for a buffet.  Not for this guy.",

    "text": "Wow, just wow! Love the concept of an all-you-can-eat Brazilian steakhouse. I recommend making reservations if you are planning to come here, but they won't seat you until your entire party is present. This place is great for groups. And I love the red light/green light system so no one is bothering you for more food when you're not ready and you stay seated for protein and a selection of sides. Just remember to turn over your card as needed. You only get up for the salad bar. The selection is okay. This is a great way to celebrate someone or spend time with family and friends with great food. And definitely come with a big appetite. A couple things though - there was one meat I was dying to have and even had to have a waitress call them over and they still never came. Eventually over time I became too full to have it when I was asked if I still wanted it. For the price, I'm not sure if I ate as much as it's worth so beware of that. Don't come here if you don't appreciate high quality, perfectly seasoned meat or if you're a picky eater. On a good note, they give complimentary full-sized dessert for birthdays if you tell your server. This place was really good but probably a one-time thing for me.",

All of their different selections of meat have little to no flavor... it just tastes like they sprinkle salt and pepper on everything. The salad bar was like any other salad bar... nothing special. The service is great and that's why I'll give them two stars instead of one. I just don't understand what the hype is all about.   A family member of mine was thinking of having her wedding reception here and after sampling the food - she changed her mind. They also said the waiters wouldn't serve the salad in the private room; everyone has to leave the room and serve their own salad... including her, in her big, fluffy wedding dress. Tacky.",

BUT also know that you are going to experience some of the best food you've ever had. Go in knowing the cost and that you're paying for incredible food and a very unique experience. It's worth it for me, make sure it's worth it for you too.   It's all you can eat! So come hungry!! There is a very extensive salad bar and then the meats come around when you're ready. I always recommend either not filling up on the salad bar or skipping it all together to save room for the meat!! They bring other sides to the table which i HIGHLY recommend you trying!! They are authentic Brazilian sides and again worth skipping the salad bar for!  A couple of people on here said that there is some order to the way the meat is brought out, but last time I went I paid attention to that and I didn't notice an order at all. Maybe they were too busy when I was there to coordinate it, but all I know is that I ask for what I want if I don't see it and they bring it right away.   The staff is wonderful. It's a different experience there because you don't have one server bringing you everything as in a typical restaurant, but everyone there is more than willing to help and they do so with a smile.   I'm telling you this place is incredible! I don't understand why they don't get 5 stars all around, but some people are just more critical than others I guess. We don't live in a fairly tale land where everything is perfect all the time; people makes mistakes and restaurants are run by people. Having been there 8-9 times over the last couple years, trust me, this place IS 5 stars!!",

At this point it was about 245. Meat choices were  limited and cold. Clearly they were closing. We ordered dessert and coffee. Coffee was cold and stale. All disappointing.

I was warned by a friend not to fill up on the salad bar and starchy side dishes before the carnivorous category F5 engulfed the table in a dizzying barrage of beef, lamb, chicken, and pork.    There are 16 different types of meat brought to your plate. You can control the flow of the meat parade by using a little stop-n-go coaster, but who wants to stop the meat parade?  Highlights for me were: anything lamb, bacon wrapped chicken, the garlic beef, and the mashed potato side dish (seriously good).   Lowlights for me were: the sirloins, the pork sausage, the corn fritter things, and the emptiness of salad-type salad bar options.   The staff were top notch, even for a bunch of younger dudes, they communicated well and were very professional. Well done sirs. We had an excellent wine pairing. They brought out a nice desert for our birthday girl and everyone left a little more swollen than when they came in. On a side note, go to the salad bar last, what my friend called \"the pusher\" and steer clear of their bathrooms unless you want to hear guttural sounds the likes of which you can never un-hear.",

The appetizer and finger food before you start your meal were delicious with no complaints! I loved the smoked salmon! I could eat that all day if I could! There were many varieties of meat that were just so mouth watering and tender. A few examples of these meat were Filet Mignon, Top and Bottom sirloin, Rib Eye, Pork Ribs, and Lamb. To think this is all you can eat as well, you can't go wrong with that! I indulged until I couldn't anymore. I mean when can you have this opportunity to keep eating these dishes with a flat rate of ONLY $40.  The wine was wonderful as well. I got a nice glass of red wine to enjoy with my meat and couldn't find any complaints but enjoyments! The bar also carries a bottle of Louis the XIII!! Now that's the second time I seen the bottle, the first being in Las Vegas, NV.   I would definitely come here again and recommend this to a friend to try!",

    "text": "First trip here May 1, 2012. We were early, about 5:30pm. We walked right in and were seated with no wait.   Wait staff were professional and respectful. We asked questions and had all our confusion resolved quickly. After reading many of the reviews here on Yelp I was prepared for a different dining experience. I was pleasantly impressed.  The salad bar was a little un-impressive with a small-ish selection of veggies, cheese, meats, and dressings. I've been to a lot of salad bars in my life, this one was the nicest to look at but one of the poorest selections. I did not understand the concept of cold veggies normally served heated. Who serves cold cooked asparagus? This place does.  So the process is simple. Seating, order drinks, go to salad bar, and when ready flip your round coaster from red to green and the many meat serving men stop by with their steaks and other meats on steel rods to slice a serving after you specify your desired cook cut (medium rare to well). They give you tongs to grab the slice and pull it to your plate.  As long as your coaster sits green side up they keep coming every few minutes. Turn the coaster to red to halt the meat.  They seemed to come in waves with cooked meats to offer. I had the beef and declined the chicken and lamb. The meat guys were a bit on the quiet side so many of them I had to have them repeat which cut it was since I wanted to avoid lamb and pork.  The meats came fast and hot. We got filled-up quickly.   The service was excellent, dining room and salad bar was clean and beautiful. I would gladly return here. Probably not a place to go in jeans and a t-shirt. Our cost for two with tip was about $130, we don't consume alcohol or dessert.  Follow-up: Been here twice more. Always pretty much the same experience. If I could change a few things; offer a way to warm the veggies on the salad bar, and to spread out the gauchos because when they arrive one after another after another makes it hard to eat and talk and deal with them. Plus if there was a way to communicate that the lamb and chicken guys can stay away, just the beef only please. What about different shaped coasters, colored, to communicate things like beef only? Just a suggestion. Oh yes, and the meat servers could speak a tiny bit louder too, or maybe a sign on the meat skewer instead of their table side whisper?  Maybe next time I go back I'll bring my own BEEF ONLY sign!",

    "text": "I had a great time at the Beverly Hills location and was excited to see Scottsdale offer a summer special: $40 with dessert. Even though I ate a lot, I was underwhelmed by my dining experience.   When eating out, I expect service to correlate with the price point of a meal. Fogo's service should be approaching outstanding. At the very least, I shouldn't be questioning throughout: Where is our waiter? Are they going to bring more sides? Are they going to clear our plates? We've been sitting here a while, are they going to offer dessert? Seems like they don't want us to pay, should we dine and dash? At least our water server kept our glasses full.  We ended up just asking him for more sides and he happily filled our request. Props to him because our waiter was useless: unwelcoming,  not personable, not attentive.  On to the food: the salad bar looked fresh and I enjoyed having some greens to munch on between meats and carbs.  The polenta fries had a nice crunch.  The bananas (what happened to thick plantains?) were good but didn't have a nice crispy exterior.  The cheese bread though is amazing, especially when hot. I could eat these all night, every night.  They probably get a star for the bread alone.  The meats were variable.  The lamb was very gamey and I usually love lamb. Some meats were very salty, especially the pork ribs.  I found the beef ribs to be a bit dry. I liked the different sirloin cuts.  My friends found some meats to have huge chunks of fat - I don't mind that because I like the flavor and texture. Just cut them off if you don't, no big deal.  Sausage and chicken were also flavorful. No sight of ribeye all night. I did have a problem with the gauchos not knowing what medium-rare looks like. They kept giving me medium to medium-well even after they slice a piece and checked it. Why even bother asking me what I prefer if they're not going to give the right temp? I wouldn't have ordered dessert if it didn't come free with the summer special. Seemed mass-produced and overly sweet.  Funny thing is that the wait team was very attentive to the larger table next to us. I overheard a patron there raving to his first-timer guests about how the food and service are ALWAYS wonderful here and how he ALWAYS has a great time. Wish I had the same experience. I'll take my money elsewhere for a pricey night out.    I was going to give 3 stars until I realized that was \"A-OK\" and 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Sorry Fogo, you were a 2 that night. Thanks for reading my Fogo essay.",

The brazillian lemonade was by far the best lemonade I've ever tasted. The mashed potatoes were so creamy & delicious, & the rolls so crispy on the outside & moist on the in.  I'll definitely have a meat hangover for days to come, but it was worth it. I just have a little feedback regsrding the service. My husband is not a huge bloody meat eater (I know, crazy right?) So when certain cuts were brought to our table he'd ask for a portion that wasnt pink & the server would say he'd be right back with something well done, but than never returned. This happened 3 times & he missed out on some awesome cuts because of it. But we will still be back; after I train his taste buds to enjoy a bloody steak just as much as I do.",

It's the same menu for both, so you're not missing out.  Both the salad bar and the main meat entree were delicious. Each for different reasons. Salad bar had so much fresh produce, including some smoked meats which were tasty. And the main entree selections were fantastic. The parmesan pork and top sirloin were my favorites. They had many options to choose from though and, more importantly, did not keep you waiting for food to come out.  I think their signature house juice is the limeade. My girlfriend loved it, I could have used something a little fruitier though, but that's my taste. It was very sweet and made a nice contrast to the salty meats. Wine or one of their cocktails would probably go well too, but it was hot and we were dehydrated.",

One thing that really got to me was when I asked if they gave a military discount. I showed them my ID as proof. They said they do. I don't know if I did something to offend them by asking. They gave me a discount, but it was $3.70 discount on a $156.8 bill (before tax). $3.70 is like a 2% discount.  I usually ask everywhere I eat if they give a military discount.  If an establishment doesn't give a discount,  I'm ok with it, you just have to say so. 2% off my tab defeats the purpose. Why give me any discount at this point.",

The lead waitress, was very pushy in suggesting menu items as if they were included in the price, when in fact, it was an additional $89 for one particular item. When I inquired about the price and then declined, she kept on insisting that I order it, making me feel less than comfortable. She then offered water to start, thinking it was included in the $55 per person charge (we were a group of 8), we agreed. Later found out the sparkling water was almost $7 a bottle. This went on and on throughout the night. Not to mention the ladies restroom was a mess as if it hadn't been cleaned at all that day. To top it all off, when we got the bill, they over charged us for some drinks and added something we didn't even have. I brought my family here for my son's 21st birthday and was ready to splurge and pay more than we would normally spend for a night out to dinner, but did not feel like the money was worth the experience. The food was good, not great. With all that said, there were some wait staff that we're very attentive and courteous. Don't think it's worth the dinner price, but might go for lunch sometime in the not so near future.",

    "text": "Made a reservation for 10 to celebrate my 30th birthday. Felt like VIPs when we pulled up in our super stretch limo! This was my 2nd time dining here so I knew it would be good. It was Saturday night and they were busy. Our table was all the way in the back. After our server explained how everything worked and took our drink order, we made our way to the salad & sides bar. There I found scalloped potatoes, red potatoes, rice & beans, and some imported cheese (I skipped the veggies). Some delicious warm cheese bread was brought to our table. Before long, several folks from my party were ready for meat and flipped their cards to the green side. It's like they opened the flood gates! Several servers rushed over, one after the next, to offer a variety of meats. Their plates filled quickly. They also brought out polenta (fried cornmeal), garlic mashed potatoes (which don't taste like garlic), and delicious caramelized bananas. By the time I was ready for meat and flipped my card over, the service had slowed. It's like I missed the window! So I had to wait a bit to be served. I ended up with filet mignon, bacon-wrapped chicken, bacon-wrapped steak, sausage, and parmesan pork. Everything was yummy! My only complaint was that everyone was seated so close to one another that we had to lean off to one side so the servers could come between us to serve the meat. Kind of annoying. During the meal, I decided I wanted to order a pina colada, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. He really abandoned us for awhile. My sister and her husband went over to the bar to get drinks. Eventually someone came over so we could order drinks. Once I finally got the pina colada, it was delicious. As we were finishing our meal, a dessert menu was placed in front of me and I was told I could choose a complimentary dessert for my birthday! I was full, but I couldn't pass on a free dessert. I was surprised to see how many choices there were! But I had to go with the strawberry cheesecake. They brought it out with a candle and \"happy birthday\" written in strawberry sauce. The slice was huge too! I took a bite and passed it around the table so everyone could try it. It was so good! I think it made two full rounds before it was gone. It was a VERY expensive meal, although the coupon I had received for my birthday helped a little bit. I enjoyed my birthday dinner and I think this is a great place to go for a special occasion.",

Sat at a bar table for about 10 minutes (absolutely no one else there), then the bartender (with a nasty attitude) literally yells to us from behind the bar if we know what we want!!!! He then brings us our drinks and our bill without even asking is we're going to want anything else. Plus our bill was full price, not happy hour or happy in any way at all. Talk about False advertisement. And what a a-hole. Needless to say we're heading out for appetizers and drinks elsewhere. Never coming to the chain again",

    "text": "Tried Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse recently since I was in the mood for some steak.  Like most Brazilian Steakhouses (Churrascaria) it is an \"all you can eat\" type arrangement and best to make sure you are very hungry to get your money's worth.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of having a heavy lunch so I was not hungry enough to try everything they had to offer for dinner.  But what I did try was fabulous especially if you enjoy your meat cooked with minimal seasoning or sauces.  Unlike some Churrascaria's I have been to, the salad bar was actually very lite and refreshing and did not fill you up quickly. Others I have been to only offer heavy creamy dressings and other heavy items to fill you up quickly so that you only eat a small portion of meat.  Additionally the ambiance was excellent as well as the service by the staff.  The house muscat and cabernet wines were also excellent.  Desert was likewise excellent, just keep in mind that certain items such as the creme brulee are upgrade items and are not included in the flat rate for the meal but was well worth the extra cost.  Overall this was a great dining experience and looking forward to eating here again.",

    "text": "This place is not easy to review. They do everything right. The restaurant, the service, the food. Everything is great. The only downside is my own gluttonous ways. I have eaten hear a few times over the years. Last night was another great experience.   The meal starts with an explanation of how everything works and what meats you will be overdosing on. You order drink and head up to the salad bar.   It's a great spread. Lots of good salad, meats, and veggies. My wife usually just does the salad bar which she says is more than enough food.  Once you finish your salad, and any worthwhile conversation for the night, the fun begins. You flip your table card from red to green and prepare for meat.  At first it seems to come fast and furious. Many servers offering many cuts of meat. I do have a few favorites.  The house special. Prime sirloin cooked perfectly. Well seasoned and a nice smoky flavor.  I also loved the bottom sirloin (flank steak), the ribeye, and of course the filet. The beef ribs were also tasty (what we call brisket)  The side are also delicious. The little bread like popover things are little bites of heaven. The fried polenta sticks are delicious and the fried plantains offer some good sweetness.  So the meat keeps coming until you flip the card back to red. I usually wait way too long to do that. I ate wayyyyyy too much last night. I think I have gout this morning. My brother may have died.   Some great quotes from our table:  \"That last swallow didn't feel right\" \"They are going to have to crank up the AC in here if I eat any more.\" \"I've got a bad case of the meat sweats going here\"  Love this place. Also nice that I don't need to eat for the next few days.",

Flip it over to the red. It is $52 per person, and it also includes the salad bar which the options there are also great! The cheese breads here are what I love the most! The reason behind my three stars is that the manager the night we went, blonde hair in a suit (this past today), made it a point to stop by every table to ask how things are going and if she can get them anything except our table. I find that very rude, we may be a table of the younger group but that doesn't mean we don't deserve the same attention or the respect as the tables around us. So if you're a group of 20 somethings going out to eat here, don't except the manager to stop by and ask how your food is. Definitely won't be coming back here anymore.",

I have wanted to dine at this restaurant for sometime, I am in Peoria and they are in Scottsdale. My daughter gave us a gift card for Christmas, no more excuses. There was a party of 7. On arrival for a 5:30 reservation we were promptly seated. Our waiter Derek went over the set up for the ones that had not eaten at a Fogo before. Through our stay Dered made sure we were well taken care of thought out the meal. I would definitely give Derek a thumbs ups.  About the food. You can start with the salad bar which is stocked with all the salad makings plus cheeses and bacon. Not the crumbled kind that nay or may not of been bacon but actual strips of bacon, crush it up for your salad or just eat the strip along with the salad.  Me I am on a protein diet and I waited at the table with the green side of my chip up. You get a chip with a green side which says I am ready for meat or a red side when you are resting between pieces of meat. The meat was excellent, every piece was well prepared. There was also at least 4 types of breads, fried bananas and mashed potatoes served with the meal.  I will be back.  Oh, and Thanks Derek for watching over us.",

Yes it is a pricey meal but well worth it for everything that is provided and a must try.  Plan on doing this with a small group 6 to 8 good friends and you could easily enjoy dinner and drinks here for a few hours, dont be in a rush cause they will keep the best cuts of meats comming all night hot off the grills. They encourage you to try everything and a new selection came by our table every few minutes.   Leg of lamb was my, so favorite full of flavors that I had a cut 3 different times thru the night. Garlic infused sirloin was a close second and everything else was very very good as well. The salad bar was good with great selections to build your first course, try a little of each but keep it light. The molten chocolate cake that we didnt have room to eat some how still vanished it was a great way to finish our meal.",

I realize that they don't call a salad bar.  When one needs to go up and serve themselves, it's a salad bar.  When they charge so much for dinner it would have been wonderful if they also brought a salad to our table.  Then they brought out ALL of the meats. Way too much.   By the time you're served the meats almost every piece was at best room temperature. It was also difficult to get your meat rare.   Not enough positive things.  Definitely not enough to bring me back",

    "text": "Terrific! I am glad I chose this venue for our anniversary dinner.  I've been wanting to go since they opened, but things have never worked out. My husband and I just celebrated our 10 year anniversary and I wanted to take him someplace special. What do [most] men love? Meat!  I made our reservations on their website and requested a quiet corner for our anniversary.  We were seated in a quieter corner (it is a big open space, noise travels, be prepared for that) where we could talk.  We were instructed about the courses (salad bar first, meat and side next) as they sat down the most wonderful popover style rolls and fried polenta - both hard to resist. We were also warned to pace ourselves. Excellent advice. Hard to follow. There are way too many delicious options.  The salad bar isn't your typical american style salad bar with pre-cut veggies, salad dressings, etc. This had a pre-tossed salad, steamed veggies, dried/cured meats, cured fish, cheese, marinated mushrooms, pasta salad, rice, potatoes, and more that I cannot remember off the top of my head. It was wonderful!  Next came the meat. They use little cards at the table. Green means \"bring the meat\", red means \"no meat needed\". The server brought out cheddar mashed potatoes and cooked bananas for our sides (I didn't care for the bananas, but my husband loved them).   Then come the gauchos with long swords of meat: all kinds of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. Different cuts, different seasonings, different cooked temperatures. And they come sometimes 2 at a time to the table. It can be overwhelming, but don't be afraid to say no or flip the card over and sample what you have already.  We tried a little slice of just about everything, but over the course of about an hour. We'd get a few slices, flip the card over so they would go to the next table, enjoy, repeat.  Our server, Robert (who was fantastic) brought out a little chocolate lava cake and ice cream with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" spelled out on the plate in strawberry sauce. It was wonderful. But by that time I was so full that I had one bite and taped out.   It was a great experience.  That being said, I dressed up and it seemed like no one else did.  It was a little disheartening to be seated next to a group of guys who looked like they just left the gym - and yes, I get they really can't control the attire of their clientele without going formal..    And for the cost (not cheap, $50 for dinner), I would have preferred a place where people didn't bring little kids.  This is not a family restaurant. I know I wouldn't bring my kids. Men are carrying around giant blades of meat for crying out loud. Their were several babies crying and it was very distracting. I was there to get away from my own babies for an hour or so.",

They say they have a ton of meat selection but I honestly felt like pass the same few cuts around. They kept asking me and my boyfriend if I wanted the bottom steak. For about 5 mins give or take we were asked 3 times if we wanted the bottom steak. On top of everything I love lamb...the guy who was passing out the bone in lamb COMPLETELY passed us like looked our way and walked away (I thought maybe he didn't see our green sides up but we placed them on the end of our table) We had to flag down one of the waiters to ask if we could get a piece of lamb. For what our bill was it was NOT worth it. It is just overpriced.",

I gave it two stars because the meats were very, very good.  However, everything  else you would want in a restaurant was terrible.  Start with value... I don't mind paying good money for a great meal if everything about the place works, but the food vs the cost does not line up.  Also, and my real beef with this place, was the ambiance.  Again, if you pay good money you should want a nice atmosphere.  This place is just a little north of a cafeteria!  Tables are cramped, very loud and just not a good atmosphere to have an intimate dinner with friends would you could actually have a discussion at the table.  You read about it, look at the menu and pictures and you form an expectation of what you will get. For me this place did not live up to expectations.",

Marco, the head server did an excellent job welcoming us back and getting us situated. The food, as always, was wonderful and they were very busy on this Saturday evening. I would recommend the picana, ribeye, bacon wrapped filet, and beef ribs. I'm a rib lover and not having to handle the large beef ribs is a plus. The salad bar is always great, but the meat is really where it's at.   The bar is fully stocked and I haven't been disappointed by any of the drinks that I have ordered. The wine list is fairly extensive as well. I usually order a Guarana Soda for the drive home to give me a bit of energy after such a large and very satisfying meal. This visit did not disappoint and the extra care exhibited on this special occasion earns them 5 stars. Excellent job!",

I can't put as much food away as I used to, but I was pleased to see the other 5 members of my family consumed plenty!  I was pleased with the cleanliness of the place, including the bathroom, because that's a big tell for me of a restaurant that cares.  Our servers were right on with the steak, chicken (more please!), lamb (didn't care for it...it's a personal taste), sausages, etc.  The salad bar was perfect!  Only thing missing was maybe a little bit of fruit to offset the savory of the meats.  Yes, there were the uber tasty bananas, but I was wanting unaltered fruit.  Not complaining...just my personal want.  After dinner, the main waiter arrived with a dessert menu for me to choose something for my birthday dessert.  Ummm...who has room for dessert?  lol  But I chose and he brought 6 spoons so the dessert could be passed around.  Oh!  My sister and I ordered the Moscato to go with the dessert and it was heaven!

    "text": "I cannot say enough good things about this place.  My boyfriend and I were in Phoenix visiting family and decided to try a Brazilian steakhouse.  Wow - I'm glad we did.  First and foremost, the food was INCREDIBLE!  The salad bar was one like none other I've ever had.  The meat does not stop coming (I especially loved the garlic beef).  I couldn't get enough of the bread and polenta.  As good as the food was -- the service was even better.  Every single person we interacted with was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable -- from the hostess to the bussers to the gauchos (the new word I learned for 'meat cowboy') to the manager checkin in.  There was a bit of a wait, but worth every second.  We will definitely come back when we are in town again.  Why isn't there a Fogo where we live in Michigan???",

    "text": "Finally...an original steakhouse,..Considering they have been multiplying like gremlins in the past 12 months. The place was packed...I wonder why ? It was a weekday. The food was awesome. No confusion as there is no menu. You just eat what they give you.    In other words it is a prix fixe: $ 42.50 for the dinner and that excludes beverages and desserts. However, the price includes sides (i.e: grilled bananas, mashed poatoes, cheese bread, and grilled polenta) and unlimited servings of their scrumptious grilled meats - there are fifteen to choose from). The dining room is beautiful as is the waitstaff - Many of them are from Brazil which adds to the authenticity of the experience.  The service was im-pec-cable!!!. Everyone was extremely accommodating and acted like they had ownership in the restaurant. They were all extremely polite and well versed in service delivery.  Considering that one steakhouse after another (at least 8), has opened in the valley in the past 12 months, this Brazilian steakhouse concept is the most original.  The salad bar is phenomenal and very varied, so even vegetarians will not get depressed at the sight of the meat skewers visiting their tables.   I have no doubt in my mind that they will be successful. My first impression was extremely positive and I hardly cannot wait to go back.",

When you sit back down and they start bringing you meat it is almost overwhelming. This is how meat should always be served, one hot mouthwatering piece at a time. Our plates were never empty. Then they bring out the cheese popovers, friend bananas, creamy mashed potatoes and friend polenta! OMG! Everything was fantastic and everyone stuffed themselves to the point we all had the \"meat sweats\" and waddled out! I will go there for a special treat again and again!!!",

The side orders they bring out were kind of bland- the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box. The corn bread was ok. I wasn't a fan of the plantanes. The meats were good, but how much meat can you eat? My favorite item was the bacon wrapped chicken, but could I eat 50.00 worth of chicken? No. The salad bar was nice, and I thought the cold meats and cheeses there were a nice touch, but really hard to eat that much food in one sitting. The concept is novel- carving of the meat from the giant knives at table side though!",

Starts with this awesome salad bar that has this enormous wheel or parmesan cheese. You flip your red card to green and holy moly! People seem to come from left and right serving you dinfferent kinds of meat, different cuts of meat and different prepared meats. They keep doing this round and round until you turn your card back to red. You can flip it back and forth all night. They also bring out side which consist of garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas, fried polenta with parmesan cheese and cheese popovers all night long. Also at your request they have 3 dipping sauces for the meats. 1 a chimchurry, 2 and house made hot sauce and 3rd a horseradish sauce. All very good. For dessert we order both the chocolate mousse and the tree leches cakes to take home. Both were.very good.    The service was probably the best I have ever had. The entire wait team work together. 1 picks up your plate and within seconds you.have a new one. Same with refills and seconds. This is a place that you never wait on them, they truly wait on you. They are on the pricey side, around 50 smackers for 1 person, so I wouldn't come here every day. But man between the food and the service, it is well worth it",

We started off with drinks. Went lightly on the fabulous salad bar, which is not easy to do as everything looks SO good. Love the little cheesy muffins they bring to the table. Then here comes the meats... I'm not going to ding them a star, but just FYI... the chunk of sirloin they were carving from was tough, and the chicken, a little dry. But everything else was YUMmeee! We even saved room for dessert. The molten chocolate cake was excellent. Not real sweet - I couldn't stop chipping away at it although I was sure I was going to explode. One chum had the Tres Leche cake and said it was the best she's had. Another had the key lime. I'm sure she would have said something, but she was too busy devouring it.  It's a LOT of food, but it's good food. As for the service, also excellent. There was always someone coming by to clear, or serve, or refill. Nicely done Fogo's, nicely done!",

    "text": "Friends took us there last night and all of us left fairly annoyed.  Admittedly it was very crowded but at $75 - $100 (after tax, tip, etc.) a person, they should be able to staff accordingly.  They sat our group of 8 in a back corner.  It looked like some sort of conference room as there was a projection screen above our head.   We sat and ordered drinks fairly quickly and then were directed to the salad bar to get started.  The salad bar was decent, however, the grilled vegetables were either overcooked and mushy or not cooked long enough.   The other items were more than decent...in all fairness.   Now for the meat.   They give you these little table markers which indicate to the servers when you are ready to try the meat selections.   It started off with a vengeance of servers coming to us to offer their wares.  However, after the first wave and only having tried a few items of what the restaurant offers - no one came.  We kept having to ask over and over to send someone with the other items and we kept getting the same meats offered to us.  So needless to say there were huge gaps in between our meal, all of the sides got cold, we had to ask for water a few times, no one came to check our bread...Coffee refill took over 10 minutes.   We were forced to leave a $70 tip due to policy but really we were borderline outraged.  Our poor friends that brought us were so embarrassed and angry.  It was a special occasion.  Living in this area - we have hundreds of fine dining choices.  Next time, we will try one of the others.   By the way, the meats themselves were hit and miss.  Some were over salty, some fatty, some over-charred, some perfect.  Ambiance is very nice though.  $500 tab - not worth it.  C.L. Gilbert, AZ",

Love how it was an upscale restaurant but families were casually dressed so it gives you a relaxing feeling. Great salad/antipasta bar. Love the cheese selection especially the fresh mozzarella. I went back for more smoked salmon after my dinner. I was told there was 19 different types of meat options and I think i tried 15 (an amazing accomplishment in my book)! Dont think for the main course you only get a ish-load of meat. There's sides of mash potatoes, fried bananas and freid polenta served family style. I just loved their cheese puff/dinner rolls. Not overwhelmingly cheesey with enough dough to make it a dinner roll.   Check out thier extensive wine list. Best way to enjoy a steak dinner is with a great glass of wine. I split a half bottle with a friend :)  Reservations for dinner highly recommneded",

How he found out, I probably will never find out anyways.    Back to Thee Food: MIND BLOWING!!!!!!  This place is so good and so worth $40 a plate.  This place makes me want to tell everyone to go for their Birthday so I have a legitimate reason to go soon.  I cannot wait to go back!! the steak is so good I do not need A1 for any slice they put on my plate.  The one thing I did not necessarily care for was the Parmesan crusted pork chop or the bacon wrapped chicken, they were both a little dry for my taste. I was also too absorbed in my delicious steak that I  was too slow to catch the guys running around with the lamb.  Lamb is pretty easy to mess up so you get that gamey type taste in your mouth if you don't marinade it correctly or don't put enough garlic.  So I was interested to see how they made theirs.  You get unlimited sides as well  and bread or whatever those awesome type rolls were. I did not love the mashed potatoes much because I love my own so much more.  The plantains were my favorite and could eat those all day!  The fried polenta was a little weird but not horrible or great. Just Whatever in my opinion.  A definite must go to if you have not been and love meat! You wont be dissapointed!!",

The concept was explained to us immediately upon being seated (you have a coaster-like card in front of you- when you flip the green side up, the meat starts coming (!), and when you turn it over to the red side, the meat stops), but we had dined at a Brazilian Steakhouse prior.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars, is because I can't help but compare it to Braza, in Connecticut, which I give five starts all-around, but at Fogo, you will not leave disappointed.  The salad bar was fresh, the meat kept coming, we received the meat exactly the way we requested (medium-rare to medium), and dessert was on the house.  I had ordered an iced tea, and they even came around with a pitcher and continuously topped it off.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

The meat was very dry and chewy. The best thing about this place is the salad bar and the polenta. If you are a fan of salad you will not be disappointed. I did like the employee's outfits. I would not visit this place again as the prices were quite high for the quality of meat I experienced.",

The ambiance is high class and you feel like you could be in one of those fancy dinner scenes in a movie. For $50 its unlimited Filet Mignon, lamb, beef, and other types of meat dishes that may just possibly clog your arteries. I would say starve yourself and definitely come here with an appetite. My roommate and I shared the chocolate fudge cake with vanilla ice cream on the side. Just what we needed to satisfy our sweet tooth. Overall, I would come here again, maybe once a year.

My husband who in a few days will celebrate 20 years of Sobriety was served an alcoholic beverage. After profuse apologies some of which were genuine, they actually still charged me for the drink. Come on.. we order a non alcohol beverage and instead received alcohol then you still charge me for it. Never once did the manager come out. This is some cases could have been life changing for most alcoholics.  To not receive the compassion or even acknowledgement is enough for me to go ahead and leave them alone. This same visit, I arrived 30 min prior to opening, waited for them to open to have them help customers that arrived after me and had just walked in the door. I get it, the customers were Brazilian didn't make them any more important than the other customers. They tried to squeeze 7 of us to a 6 person table and didn't appreciate me asking to move to a more roomy table. It was lunch time on a Wednesday, no reason to squeeze anyone like Sardines. Just a bad visit all the way around.",

I've eaten at your restaurant many times and when I got this months e-mail regarding Arizona Restaurant Week, I thought this was great and what a deal. $40.00 vs.$49.00 plus free dessert. WOW was I mislead;  to find, A Limited meat selection and the dessert was a tiny sliver. One of the main reasons I enjoy your restaurant is the lamb chops and filet both plus others not available. So I choose to pay the full price $49.00, so I could enjoy the things I go to Fogo de Chao for. Then I was told \"but we will still include the free dessert\" they failed to tell me it was just a tiny sliver and not your normal full portions.  If you want to run a special with reduced selections and portions that is fine JUST SAY SO IN YOUR ADS. Don't wait for me to come in to find out. That just pisses me off and makes me wonder if I'll ever come back. Buyer Beware of Misleading Ads.",

You will have no excuse if you said you are going home hungry. The salad bar is fantastic, the service is on par. The prices are what one would expect as this is more of a buffet style establishment. The ambience is upbeat and noisy.  The last few times I have noticed quality control is starting to diminish. Almost all of the meat contained chunks of fat or pieces of cartilage. Thought we may have went on a bad night but it was the same story the next couple times we went. The food is still good you just have to work a little harder on your cut of meat.",

We arrived and were promptly seated. My wife and i each visited the market table and got a small salad. After that we flipped our cards and the fun began.   My favorite two meats were the Pinchia and the Filet(without bacon). The filet was so fresh and perfectly cooked it literally melted in your mouth. We were served the last two pieces of garlic beef from one of the meat people and it was way overcooked.  Other than that we were able to get the requested temperature on every other meat.   Our waitress was very attentive and refilled our drinks before they ever got close to empty.   The reason it gets a 4 stars is what happened when we paid(take note it was not our original waitress that processed our check). We had a $100 visa gift card and requested that they charge $100 on that card and the rest on another card. When the bill was returned they had charged only $80 on the visa gift card and the remaining amount on the other card with no explanation.   We had a great time and will definitely come back in the future.",

Since working in the reasturant for about 3 years I have witnessed constant overturn at my job, but Fogo has kept the same hard working people hustling and bustling to please the customers needs. This also falls on management! Employees enjoy being there, whenever that happens, food will have more love and quality to it.

    "text": "I really wanted to give Fogo De Chao 5 stars. Their food is amazing. I have been 3 times, and 2 of the 3 times were perfect.   Fogo De Chao is certainly an experience, you start off with the salad bar, which is no where near your typical Jell-o salad bar. They have smoked salmon, and their fresh Parmesan cheese wheel is extremely unique for most places.  The meat selection is not only good, the taste is out of this world. The service for the most part is phenomenal you never have to ask for anything.  Now having said that, my husband and I went to Fogo for Valentine's day. We had reservations, and I understood that we would be waiting. It was more the fact that they had probably about 50, 2 person tables crammed into one of their big rooms to the point that you could not pull your chair out to get up from your table without being in someone elses lap, and forget about getting the meat selection you want if you were in the corner, which we were. Half of the gauchos completely ignored our corner.   It was less then to be desired.  Pros: Fantastic Food and atmosphere (non holiday)  Cons: Holiday planning on their part. Just don't go.",

All the food was delicious - the salad bar, all the meats (that were brought to the table every few minutes), the side dishes and even the bread. The staff couldn't have been nicer and we especially loved our server Justin. Warning to come hungry and with money - complete dinner was pricey, but worth it for a special occasion! Had a great time and would definitely go back...",

There was a excellent salad bar with items such as mozzarella, roasted red peppers, salmon, asparagus, marinated mushrooms and all sorts of salads. One could honestly fill up on one circle of the salad bar, but I was careful to save room for the delicious meats.  The selection of meat was incredible, from what I can remember: bacon wrapped filet mignon, top sirloin, lamb chops and leg of lamb, chicken in garlic, sausage, pork ribs, bacon wrapped chicken and on and on. The sides were great too, crispy polenta, mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas.    What really made this night special was the amazing service. We were given a tour of the kitchen so we got to see how it was all prepared. Our server was also quick to make sure we were able to taste every meat selection they had, and to send the guys over had we requested more of a particular item.    This was a 5 star dining experience and I will definitely be back. Thanks Gabi!",

If your are a vegetarian this place might not be for you although I am sure the menu could accommodate.  I like the table service-  green=bring me more, red=i'm kind of full for now.  The food was really good and the experience of the place was fun!  The salad bar walk thru needs to be re vamped because it doesn't flow fast enough, at least that was my experience on the evening I was there, possible on a slower evening it would be fine.  Good place to go for a special occasion or with a group.  All in all service was good, food was delicious and I can't wait to have a reason to go back!",

    "text": "My wife and I have frequented this restaurant a number of times and had grown to love this place. But yesterday's experience will be our last.  I had made an on-line reservation, and in the request comments of their website I specified that I was bringing my wife for dinner to celebrate her birthday on 12/12/12 (date of our reservation).  We walked in about 10 minutes early, I specified who the reservation was for and we walked right in. At the time (6PM), the restaurant was still empty (it was more than half full by the time we left, about 60 minutes later).    The food is always top notch at Fogo de Chao. The salad bar (especially the smoked salmon, various cheeses and sun dried tomatos are some of our favorites) is well stocked with specialty items.  The meats are always excellent and the diversity offered is the main attractive element of this place.  So where did things start to go wrong for us?  I should mention that we accompanied dinner with a couple of glasses of sparkling wine.  Things started going downhill when our glasses were empty. Both my wife and I were not in a drinking mood, and so, at the first instance of being asked whether we desired more wine, we respectfully declined.  Less than 30 seconds later we were asked again, by a different waiter - this time we thought it was kind of funny to have so much attention paid to us (and we figured that since I had mentioned it was my wife's birthday, they wanted to pay a little extra care to our table), but we declined again.  Not more than 30 seconds later, a different waiter comes by again and asks us the exact same question.  Now it was downright annoying.  Not more than 1 minute later, we received the precise exact question.  My answer this time was more curt, \"We do not want any more wine.\" Fortunately, they did not come back a 5th time.  I have noticed that there is little comminucation among the service staff at Fogo de Chao.  The right hand rarely knows what the left hand is doing.  At this point we had concluded our dinner and the waiter had removed our plates. I was expcting a little slice of birthday cake with a candle to drop by any second. Instead, the waiter comes by with our check.  I was upset at this turn of events.  We're not at In-N-Out here paying $10 for a couple of burgers, and was taken aback that apparently nobody had read my reservation comments - what is the point of including such comments?  I went to the front desk and told the hostess that I was disappointed that Fogo de Chao could not even acknowledge my request. I was asked what my name was and I specified the name of my reservation.  I was told, \"I'm sorry but I just forgot\", was the reply.  Really? So I'm spending well over $100 (including drinks) and the reply that I receive is \"I'm sorry but I forgot?\".  The hostess then asked what table we were at, and mentioned that they would be bringing something by very soon. We waited for 10 minutes and decided to just pay our bill as bothof us wanted to get out of there. Finally, a different waiter came by with a slice of cake, apologizing for the hostess (again with the \"she forgot\" commentary) with a candle for my wife.  It is the little things that make such a dinner memorable. Fogo de Chao completely dropped the ball, in my opinion.  They did remove our drinks from the bill, but instead left a sour taste in our mouths.  Asking us 4 times, within a 2 minute interval, if we want more wine is more important to them than paying attention to the small but crucially significant details that make a birthday dinner special.",

    "text": "OK, so maybe my barbarian talk review was lost on many readers so I have decided to edit my initial review of Fogo. Needless to say, this place will bring out the inner meat eating barbarian in all of us.   I have been to the Fogo de Chao in Philadelphia and the one in Scottsdale numerous times, both locations offer the freshest items and both have their signature wait staff who bring the meat on the fly when your card is green.   If you're bringing new initiates, advise them to come prepared. That being said, this place isn't a \"buffet\". It is a bit classier than that and as I mentioned, you will be getting quality items from both the salad bar and the main course with excellent service all around. Regardless if you get \"your money's worth\", it is an experience everyone should enjoy at least once.   The Philadelphia location is right in center city and the AZ location is in yuppy Scottsdale. However, like \"Jason V.\" mentioned, there were definitely more family tables at the AZ location than the one in Philly. No judging here either, but I agree that Fogo is not the place to bring infants and toddlers.",

Besides the food though, there sat us at a table that was by the door, which was okay, there just seemed to be a lot of traffic. There was a very large party next to us that had 2-3 young children that were running around and screaming. It was not a pleasant dinner and it was very loud. It definitely was difficult to talk across the table. Towards the end of dinner, we wanted to get desert due to celebrating a birthday and the wait staff seemed to disappear on us. By the time they came around and asked if we would like desert, everyone was ready to leave. We definitely will try this place again because the food was excellent, but hopefully next time the atmosphere will be better.",

    "text": "I have eaten at the Fogo de Chao restaurants in Houston, TX and Scottsdale, AZ multiple times. Both were amazing. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. It is well worth the $40 price even if you do not plan to stuff yourself since it is all you-can-eat. You are paying for the quality, not quantity. There is such a variety of different cuts of steak, as well as pork and chicken. All have their own unique flavor and all are extremely tasty. If you are not a huge meat eater, you can get just the salad bar for half the price. That is also worth the trip in my opinion since it contains many unusual options such as hearts of palm, fresh mozzarella balls, and sun dried tomatoes that are not found in your average salad bar. The side dishes served at the table are also very, very good if you like Latin food. Black beans, crisped polenta cakes, and steamed plantains. What more do you want?",

    "text": "My wife (Brazilian) and I give this 5 stars and in a bullet fashion...here is why.  Valet parking - sorry folks, if I'm going to kick up a hundo for a meal for my wife and I, this is to be somewhat special and elegant.  Kudos for the valet parking especially considering my wife was wearing 5\" heels so she appreciated me springing for it.  Not sure what my old man's problem was that he was too cheap to do it and he walked with his wife for 10 minutes to get to the front door.  This was on a Saturday night mind you.  Cordial - From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted and taken care of without having to ask if they forgot us.  We had our 14 month old with us and we were trying to get a picture of the three of us so the hostess rushed over and snapped a photo of us.  Food - My dad and I are carnivores but he did nail down some seafood at the salad bar.  The apple-chicken salad was awesome and the ladies enjoyed just about every facet of the salad bar.  Let's just say there was parmesan everywhere!  As for the main course, the rodizio was as good as it gets.  My old man and I nailed down as much meat as the intestines would handle.  If you haven't done Brazilian rodizio before, nearly everything is seasoned with rock salt.  Many of the cuts were being brought on two skewers, one more on the rare side and one more well done.  I like my meat to the rare side and the flavor was incredible.  Restaurants like this make you wish you had a bottomless pit.  Meat lovers, please visit SOON!  Service - This is a key again for me.  I have no tolerance for paying for a meal, let alone one this expensive, and being treated like I never walked in the door.  Honestly, I can cook up a good meal and serve myself and save the complaints and the excessive $$$ if necessary.  Fogo did not disappoint one bit.  The servers were very friendly, on top of the table constantly...not one mistake in anyone's drink...even kept my little guy's apple juice full.  One thing we really liked is that there was one individual who was hitting the tables asking what types of meat we were waiting for specifically, not only did he remember...we soon had the meats we preferred flowing to the table faster than we could devour them...definitely pleased with this extra attention to detail.  Only two things that weren't positive and I wouldn't say they were a negative by any means...in fact if they didn't happen, this would have been a 6 out of 5 rating from us.  First, my dad and his wife shared the Flan from the dessert menu and claimed it wasn't as \"light\" as it should be.  Honestly, how in the heck did he have room for dessert in the first place?     And the last item on my soapbox is one I'm sure a few in Phoenix complain about but it's hard to get the restaurants to enforce.  I'm originally from the midwest and we dress up to go to Applebees so folks, please don't come to a restaurant like this dressed in your damn basketball shorts.  We were there on a Saturday night and fortunately most of the Scottsdale folk dressed adequately for the occasion but there were some exceptions.  Honestly I think this place is busy enough that they should be more strict with the dress.  My dad lives in Paradise Valley not far from the place but my wife and I made the trek up from Maricopa to enjoy this cuisine and we WILL BE BACK!   Fogo, thank you for a wonderful dining experience.",

The service is phenomenal and absolutely what you'd want when you spend that much money for food.   Negatives: We are absolutely meat lovers, and enjoy good flavor, however with the exception of a couple of cuts, there really wasn't too much to it, other than over salted entrees. Also, we went here for spring restaurant week and normally the prices during this week should be much cheaper than normal for a 3 course meal, and instead it was only 6 dollars cheaper than any other normal dinner night. I thought this was very deceiving when I made reservations. I wouldn't mind paying the money, if they were upfront about it.   Worth trying once just to say you went there, but we probably won't be going back.",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews for restaurants, but thought that this one fully deserved it - in the best way. I took my dad for a late Father's Day dinner last and had the most amazing time. We arrived 10 minutes early for our 7:30p reservation, but were immediately seated. Our water was filled as we sat (the server, who showed up at the table before us and the hostess pulled out our chairs for us) and the server explained the process to us in a friendly manner. We ordered our drinks and hit the salad bar.   The salad bar is to die for - all types of lettuce, rare veggies and additives like marinated bamboo, fresh mozzarella and FULL artichoke hearts (amazing); all fresh. There is also apple salad, potato salad, and more that I can't even remember.   Before we got back to the table with our salads, our drinks were waiting for us on the table. We left the token on red as we chowed down on our salads and chatted for a while until the sides arrived; mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas and fried polenta...all fantastic. After explaining the side dishes, our server took our salad plates and brought us fresh ones for the meat.  Immediately after switching the tokens we received non-stop service from the meat servers, who always made sure to ask how we wanted the meat and if we wanted more, etc. and were happy to explain the cuts. The meat itself was divine. The only complaint that I could think of was that the rub for the lamb was quite salty, but I don't really enjoy salty foods and my dad loved it, so I think it's more of a preference - the meat was so good, I just cut the edges off and kept eating.  Our drinks were constantly filled always before they were completely empty (we were drinking water and iced tea because neither of us wanted to fill up on wine or booze). More than that, every so often the sever would come by and ask if there was any specific meat we wanted more of at that moment as not to make us wait until it came around or if we wanted more sides (the sides, the salad, and the meat are unlimited). They also give you fresh plates anytime they see trimmings or bones, etc. hanging around on the plate, which I appreciated.   All and all, it was a great experience and well worth the price ($50 per person)! Mind you I am pretty stingy, so something HAS to be worth it for me to pay over $100. We were not rushed whatsoever (We arrived at 7:20p and didn't leave until 9:30p). This is definitely on my list of best restaurants for special occasions.",

Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close.  It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!",

I had been on the web site before we left so I knew the prices; I believe it was $47.50 for the meal and $19.50 for the salad bar only. I don't eat meat so I'm glad they had the salad bar option as well. Since it was a Friday night and we didn't want to wait forever to eat I jumped online and made an online reservation through their site. Once we arrived we only waited a few minutes before being seated. Parking took longer than that...it looked like they had complimentary valet but I didn't have any cash for a tip so we wanted to self-park which looked like the majority of customers did. The parking lot is shared with some other busy stores so parking was very competitive. The restaurant has an open feel and was pretty packed. The atmosphere isn't very relaxing though, the whole restaurant shares the one salad bar which was pretty packed all night, there are the meat chefs buzzing through all the tables constantly, and each section seemed to be run by multiple waiters, bus boys, etc... It just had a very busy feel. There is no menu. You sit, you get an explanation of the service, and you immediately start eating. The entire experience took less than an hour.  Drinks: I ordered a diet coke and it came in a mini bar bottle with a glass of ice. He had an iced tea. The sodas are $3.00...per mini bar bottle so if you like to have a few glasses with dinner...you should order an iced tea which is free refills.  The salad bar has 30 different items which included a spring mix, looked like butter lettuce, spinach, sliced tomatoes, fresh balls of mozzarella, roasted peppers, giant asparagus, green beans, croutons, taboule, bread, potato chips (thick sliced potatoes), mushrooms, cheeses, dressings, and more. They also had some deli meats and fish but I don't eat meat so I didn't pay close attention.  Your meal comes with sides...to be completely honest, although they were nice with the meal, the flavors were somewhat bland. The pao de queijo (warm cheese bread) was exactly like a popover...the fluffy baked good you may enjoy for breakfast with butter and jam. They were okay (pretty bland); I only had one. The crispy hot polenta was served in squares. They were definitely crispy and it was tasty...reminded me of hashbrowns both in flavor and texture. The garlic mashed potatoes were also just okay for me. They were creamy in texture...almost to the point they tasted artificial and were topped with cheese. They weren't served hot though so the cheese did not melt at all. The food was all warm. It seemed like they may pre-dish everything since they get so busy. The caramelized bananas were not sweet. To tell you the truth...they were so bland I thought that they were plantains. They look very dry when they were brought to us...no extra sauce or anything. They just looked unappetizing. We both tried a bite...I guess they could be used between dishes as a palette cleanser.  We also asked for rice and black beans. These are only brought out upon request. The rice was very good...a mild but delicious flavor. The black beans were drowning in bean juices but tasted good...until I bite into a piece of meat and had to spit them out! Yes, I made the decision to spit out food into my cloth napkin in a nice restaurant.  I could not swallow it. Since I mentioned at the beginning of the meal that I don't eat meat, I was very surprised that they didn't warn us about the beans but everyone's human so I didn't really care. I just asked for a new napkin.   For meat service, they have a two sided card for each person; red means stop, green means come at me with those meat sticks. My boyfriend picked out which items he wanted to try...he liked the filet mignon the best. It added up quickly though, they're small pieces but with the multiple meats, the sides, and the salad bar we both got full really fast. I can't stress enough that the service was seamless and everyone was so friendly. The bill, after tip was $97 and change. Keep in mind, we did not have any alcoholic drinks and I only had the salad bar. This experience was a different one and I took my boyfriend here for the meat, to compensate for all the vegetarian meals he shares with me, but overall I would say the food was great, but not the most amazing thing I've have ever experienced. Next time, I would prefer a nice steak house with a more relaxing feel...especially since it's not everyday that we spend $100 on dinner for the two of us.",

Meat was overcooked, fatty and low quality. Medium should be pink throughout not well done and grey. My plate was covered with meat scraps and I probably got around two bites of meat that I actually ate. I didn't think this would ever happen in my lifetime but I spit out filet mignon- how does a steakhouse screw up one of the best cuts of beef? Sides and salad bar weren't appealing either. They brought the wrong bottle of wine. The only good thing about the place was they didn't charge me $50 for the dog food they served.",

I have eaten at the Fogo de Chao in Dallas many times so I knew what to expect, amazing service and perfectly cooked and seasoned meat.  For the $30 you will spend on lunch, you should not expect anything less. As I walked in, I was not disappointed.  Everything was first class.  The salad bar was just as you would expect in a five star steakhouse.  I learned from previous visits not to waste too much time at the salad bar.  I came for the meat, cooked Brazilian style, and I was hungry. As soon as I sat down, I flipped my card to \"green\", which signals that I was ready for meat.  \"Red\" means stop bringing meat.  I didn't really care what came to me first; I knew it would all be delicious.  As luck would have it, the first \"gaucho\", Portuguese for cowboy, to come by had one of my favorites; top sirloin.  My mouth was watering as he sliced off two big pieces from the rotisserie skewer.  This is where the fantasy of what I was expecting ends and reality set in.  The meat was dry and rather bland.  What!  This had never happened to me at this restaurant before.  Of the dozens of times I had eaten in Dallas, the food was always perfect and top notch.  The Scottsdale Fogo de Chao was turning out to be a disappointment. I thought to myself that I simply had one bad cut of meat and it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I tried the filet mignon, the lamb, the chicken and the pork.  They were all dry and flavorless.  The only thing that made spending $30 on lunch worth it was the fabulous meat, yet what they were serving was not even as good at Texas Roadhouse. I'm sure that one day I will go back and give them another chance.  Every day that passes I convince myself that it wasn't as bad as it was.  As soon as my memory fades enough, I'll be back for at least one more try.  Besides, it is too much fun to drop a bread crumb on the table and watch the headwaiter scramble to come clean it up.",

    "text": "I love food, yet I am admittedly not a huge steakhouse guy. So I have not been aware of the growing popularity of Brazilian steakhouses as a \"thing.\" And Fogo de Chao is apparently the apex of the Brazilian steakhouse experience. And so it came to pass that an opportunity came to check out Fogo in Scottsdale (hey, it was either this or Benihana) so we said, what the hey, and pulled the trigger.  So Fogo has a unique structure. They have a salad bar, which - by itself - could be and is a draw. They have a great selection of coldcuts and cheeses, delicious pasta salads. They have a hot food bar with rosemary potatoes, scalloped potatoes, wild rice, black beans and that I could've easily filled up. But no. No, listen to me. Do not fill up on their polenta sticks, plantains, and puffed bread. That's a ruse to keep you from the honeypot.  'The honeypot?' You say, quizzically.  You see, once you're seated at Fogo they give you a card. One side is a red stop sign. The other is go. Sure, without it, they'll bring you some great mashed potatoes at first, but once you flip green. Boom, you are in the danger zone.  Meat will come. From so many people. Meat on a stick. Parmesan pork. Top sirloin. Bottom sirloin. Filet mignon. Bacon wrapped chicken. Even bacon wrapped pork. Plus lamb shanks and more more more!!!  In all seriousness, the cuts of meat are great and varied. From well done to rare and a singular experience that'll make you feel like a king.  The food there is delicious. The experience is pretty epic. Good for a birthday, anniversary, dental graduation. And it beats Benihana.  It is expensive. Between the two of us, after wine, the bill was almost $200 dollars, so not an everyday kind of thing, but good on occasion but definitely felt worth the money.",

Obviously most people come for the meat...yes the variety is awesome, but the meat is great to so-so to poor. We had an abundance of their least quality steak coming around as well as bacon wrapped dry chicken! In over an hour we only saw many of the meats once. I asked politely three times for the ribs, and after 20 minutes of waiting I gave up. I felt scammed - the pork loin was incredibly dry and a lot of the steak reminded me of zoo animal smells. How many times do we have to say NO to the sausage? I realize it's their cheap filler, but c'mon...  The highlight of the night was the filet, ribs (beef), chicken, the bread, polenta, and the mozzarella.   It was nice leaving full, but I'd rather grill at home next time!",

    "text": "Father's Day was super busy so that's why I am giving a 3 instead of a 2. I do understand, first hand, that being busy effects service. We actually had great service from everyone, except our server. At the beginning he was around often but then he never really came back. The main issues were in regards to availability of items. They were out of 2 wines that we ordered and the dessert we ordered. They said the creme brulee wouldn't be ready for 2 hours and they wouldn't serve it before. We had to ask multiple times to get any lamb at the table, which turned out to be a bit overdone and too gamey. We also had to ask a couple times for the filet, which sadly was the only steak that wasn't good. Flank steak was amazing!! Bacon steak was great, sirloin was great, and pork was good. Luckily another server helped us with anything we needed. Paying our bill was a nightmare. Took 30 minutes. They over charged us and then disappeared forever when we asked for it to be adjusted. The highlight of the night- a completely separate server, after an hour of being told about the dessert, brought us a creme brulee. And it was delicious. We did speak to the manager. She didn't seem to care or acknowledge anything. Not that we needed anything free (Father's already got a free meal on the next visit, the problem is that no one wants to go back.) BUT there were no apologies or care. Bummer experience for such a pricey place.",

After our host sat us, we waited for 20 min for a server to ask if we wanted any drinks. We went greeted by a server or anything. In fact I was very confused on who my server was. I understand that it's Valentine's Day, and maybe there was a mix up, but we didn't have a server for our table period.   The food was delicious but I don't understand why they ask how we like our meat, because virtually all the meat that we asked ( med rare) were well done.   When we were ready to pay we literally sat there for 30 min trying to get someone's attention. I finally got the hostess attention that was seating another couple. A guy came over and gave our bill. Then another 20 min sitting there waiting for someone to pick up my card, had to waive another person down. And guess again waited another 20 min for my card to get back.   Needless to say we were not happy whatsoever.  Have never been so disappointed in a reputable restaurant.",

    "text": "Fogo de Chao is a Brazilian Steakhouse, where they serve all kinds of roasted protein (chicken, all types of steak, sausage, etc) tableside with somewhat kebab style skewers. You flip a coaster from red to green indicating when to be served and green to red indicating when to stop being served. You can flip back and forth as much as you like.   We came with a group 8+ deep, without reservation on a Friday, and they were more than accommodating - although the hostess jokingly flashed me the mean face when I told her how many people we had coming. The atmosphere is spacious and warm, seemingly upscale but not so smuggy you couldn't come in sweatpants with your family.   We got a couple drinks while waiting, such as the Caipirinha (my first time having one) which was delicious and the peach Bellini which was tasty but thick. Ran about $13/drink, where beer was about $7-$8 each.  They serve fried polenta sticks and some type of bread, both OK, as appetizers. There are plenty of options at the help-yourself food bar, including smoked salmon, greens, and meat/cheeses. The trick is to pick sparingly here and save room for the onslaught of skewered protein.  By far the best meats were the ribeye, sirloin, and mignon. The bacon-wrapped chicken was dry, the lamb was amazing however it was encrusted with black peppercorn to the point it became overpowering. Make sure to watch the cut of the meat when they ask what seer you want, because there were a couple times the beef was what I would consider medium-rare to rare when I was asking for \"medium\". I prefer my meat on the well-done side and I'm not the carnivore kind of guy you might see on Masterchef.  Overall, the Fogo - much less the Brazilian steakhouse - experience is a must try. Caution: Be prepared to drop some serious cash! Given it's Scottsdale where you may end up parking next to a Ferrari, our check was $173 including gratuity and not counting tip or our earlier drinks/beer for two people. The last time I spent that much at a \"steakhouse\" it was because of strippers. No strippers at Fogo...",

We chose this restaurant because our son doesn't like the traditional turkey dinner however my husband and I do.  Fogo de Chao advertised that they would be offering, in addition to their normal menu, sliced turkey and all the trimmings.  We thought perfect, everyone will get something they like.  Our dinner reservations were at 5pm.  We were seated promptly upon on arrival, however, when my husband and I went to the buffet station which was where the turkey was supposed to be located, there was nothing there.  We asked our server about this and were told that they ran out of turkey and trimmings earlier in the day.  As I said, it's not like we went for a late dinner, we were there at 5pm. Needless to say, we were pretty disappointed. The meat offerings at the restaurant were just OK, we've eaten at Texas de Brazil in Aruba and Florida, and the food was much better.     I sent the restaurant an email after our experience and got absolutely no response.  This certainly was extremely poor planning on their part, felt a bit like a bait and switch.  We will never eat at this restaurant again because of the lack of customer service, it seems like a response to my email was the least they could have done after ruining our Thanksgiving meal.",

Couldn't find anything that I liked the pork was decent steak was garbage this is saying something outback could probably provide a steak better if not the same. Would not go back for the price could have went to Ruth's Chris. Had to also get out of my chair and get my own plate and cutlery to end here won't be returning",

    "text": "I am late in writing this review so it is over due.  Last week my husband and I celebrated Veterans Day & his birthday at your wonderful restaurant in Scottsdale.  My husband Jay and I ordered the Chilean Sea bass & it was absolutely delicious!.  We planned to order the Steak...etc... but when a neighboring table raved over the various flavors my husband and I could not resist.  Needless to say we were in flavor heaven which included grilled asparagus and cheddar mashed potatoes.  We also had the salad bar and those hot rolls ...fabulous..., which meant we had to take some of our food home.  It was truly a great experience and if that was not enough, Tahson one of your waiters talked to us about the brazillian drink - The caipirinia? , we then ordered 2 of those drinks and my husband received a complimentary slice of birthday cake and again we were in flavor heaven.  We have been to many of your restaurants in LA, SF, LV, DC, Phili, Boston, VA, FL, Chicago, & now that we live in AZ, this will be our new go to place here.  So as I end this review with a thank you that is beyond words.  I must send a special note and thanksgiving wish to the following team members of this lovely establishment.  I will start my well wishes to the manager, Claire, then Favi, Susana, Drew, Christopher, Steven, Tahson= Brazilian Caipirinhia cocktail :) and last but not least Hector and Chanel who I called today to find out how to place this add in Open Table ( she said just use Yelp) :)  so thanks again everyone it was a wonderful and flavorful experience. We will see you again soon. Until then please take care and have a happy and Blessed holiday.  Thanks, Mel and Jay :) in Gilbert AZ",

    "text": "Fogo has slipped a bit since they opened - the salad bar isn't quite as spectacular as it was (where are the sun-dried tomatoes, pray tell?), but hey - let's be honest - you don't go to Fogo for the salad bar, right?  This is still the carnivore capital of Scottsdale - a legion of men walking around with swords lined with various meats, and all you have to do to get them to offer you some is turn a coaster from the red side to the green side?  Sign me up!  The Picanha is the house special for good reason - it's amazing!  The top and bottom sirloin are also very good, as are the beef ribs.  Oddly, the ribeye (normally my favorite cut) is among my least favorites at Fogo.  Skip it and get the lamb chops instead (rare).  The sausage is tasty as well.  Not a fan of Filet, so I don't waste the tummy space on it, but those with me who favor it give it a hearty thumbs up.  I really ought to try the chicken sometime, but...it's chicken, and they have beef!  That said, the pork ribs are also quite tasty.  Skip the pork loin, unless that's really your thing.  Let's talk about sides - the cheesy poofs (cheese bread things) used to be fantastic - this time, they were about 3 times as long as in the past (off night?) - they have polenta and garlic mashed potatoes to fill you up on cheap stuff - skip those, but eat several of the fried bananas!  Of course, you saved room for dessert (admit it, there's always room for dessert).  The molten chocolate cake is killer, as is the key lime pie, and the creme brulee, but...I always get the Papaya Cream - papaya and ice cream blended together, and topped with a black currant liqueur that adds a tart complexity to the wonderfulness that is papaya blended with ice cream - try it, if you don't love it, call me and I'll come over and finish it for you.  Great place to take people when you want a dinner to remember - part dining experience, part meat theater - always memorable.",

Dessert for the night was creme brulee- and it was oh so good!    Ambiance definitely sets the mood!  Love the place!  Great for a couple's date night or a group dinner date.    Service was good.  Our server was very diligent and was always checking in.  Some of the meat servers, I felt, were a bit in a rush which concerned me as they carry a big knife along with them.

They bring you bread, fried cheese (?), fried bananas, and garlic mashed potatoes. Then you go to the salad bar for salads, lunch meats, cheese, veggies, etc.   You sit down and they start bringing you all kinds of meat. Lamb, beef, pork, and chicken. And, it's not just any beef, either. It's the good stuff like filet mignon and flank and sirloin. Suggestion: just ask for the bacon wrapped filet mignon right off the bat. It's the most succulent piece of heaven I've ever had. Skip the rest ;)   The food is neverending! Jk it ends when you can't eat anymore. I ate until my heart was beating outside my chest. That isn't even an exaggeration. You'll understand if you ever go there.   Price? Pricy. I went at 930pm and paid 49.50 for the entire experience.   What I learned: 1. Don't go in jeans. Wear lose clothing.                       STRETCHY PANTS NEVER FELT SO GOOD BEFORE.  2. Don't load up on so many carbs.  3. Go straight to the bacon wrapped filet mignon. 4. Show up earlier to make more eating and digesting time.   Why did I give it 4 stars for what sounds like an amazing experience? I didn't like some of the stuff like the chicken and some of the beef.   THE END. (Bows, rolls away, then falls asleep)",

    "text": "First, on a personal note, I can't eat a lot in one sitting, so all-you-can-eat places generally aren't for people like me. $65 to eat an amount of food I could get for a third of the price doesn't make sense to me. If you can eat $65 worth of meat, by all means, come here.   I was pleased with the meats. All were prepared well, and the flavor was amazing. I got to have leg of lamb, lamb chops, various steaks, and some pork loin. All were satisfying and tasty.   My problem is with two things: value for the dollar, and soft drinks.   The website for the establishment says all beverages and desserts are extra.   Fine.   But for $65 a head, I think I should be able to have a bottomless beverage, not $4 for each 12 oz can of ginger ale. This is America. Get with the program. Bottomless beverages are expected in this country. Install a fountain.   I got to try a bite of the key lime pie, and it was no better than a slice of Edward's frozen key lime pie that you can get in any grocery store.   Why do I mention this?   Because a single slice of key lime pie here is $8.50. I can get the whole pie and a can of whipped cream for that and still have change left over.   I am a frugal person, and I believe this place lacks a few amenities that its price tag would usually indicate. I probably won't be back any time soon.",

I have been here multiple times and have brought multiple friends here and we are never disappointed. I would recommend going for lunch for two reasons. One it is cheaper and two it gives you time to digest before going to sleep and falling into a food coma. The waiters come around with large skewers of meat and you choose which cuts of meat you want. One of my favorites is the picana. They also have this amazing cheesy bread. There is a salad bar but to be honest I don't even waste my time with that.",

Loved the atmosphere and the sides available at the bar. The polenta fries are to die for and we devoured them. The cost is well worth it, and I will be going back. The one star knock is because our server was never around. We had a reservation and our section wasn't very crowded. After dropping us at our table he disappeared and we had several other servers pick up his slack. We still had to flag people down and waited a while between drink refills. Maybe because the tips go into a pool he didn't feel the need to make himself available, but we were unimpressed. He also overcharged us for our daughters meal since she was under 12 and when asked he said that the policy was under 11. Honestly the price difference wasn't a huge issue, but you'd think he would have abided by their published age after I pointed it out. I thought he was going to adjust the check, but he didn't and we got our check after not having seen him for over an hour from a different server. By that point we were ready to leave and it wasn't worth our time. I will go back again and hopefully the server will be better.",

    "text": "It has taken me a few days to not write this review as a knee jerk reaction.  We decided this year on Thanksgiving we were going to surprise my daughter with a new dining experience and not cook.  So we thought this would be the perfect place since both my husband and I have been many times when we lived in Dallas and it was amazing there 8-10 years ago.  We had reservations for 4:30pm and didn't get seated until 5pm. The waitress walked us through a very congested and packing dining room. Which really needed to have at least 10 tables taken out to let people walk paste them.  I must have had to apologize to 4 customers since I had to force them to move their chairs so my family could be walked  all the way to the other side of the restaurant for the waitress to say I really have no clue where you are so suppose to be seated.  We walked halfway back and she basically seated up on the kitchen walkway area and half smiled and said you should get your meats first in this spot.  If, I hadn't been so hungry we would have walked out and went home and cooked a grill cheese.  Unfortunately, and $200 later I convince my husband to stay at the work dinner we have ever eaten.  The Salad bar was nothing like I remembered in Dallas and the turkey was not in a warmer just on a cutting board nice and cold.  The stuffing was rock solid.  Now it was time for the meat.  All my daughter could say is Mom do I have to eat this your steak is way better.  So we asked for our check and left.  The experience was terrible and food not great.  Don't waste your money in a town full of amazing restaurants that you can chose from this was a disappointment for sure.  They seem have have changed their dining model to more of a buffet quick eat and pack as many people in a restaurant as you can up to code.  They need to lower their prices if they are going with this new dining model.",

Overall, it was a decent meal but I wouldn't rate it among the best churrascaria places I've been to.   Being that this is Phoenix, and there aren't any high concentration of Brazilian/Portuguese populations nearby (at least that I'm aware of), I could see why people would love this. First off, it's all-you-can-eat and the meat is of decent quality (certainly better than any Asian buffet in the area).   Personally, my favorite were the beef ribs as it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The other meats weren't bad, but it was a notch below what you would get at a high-end steakhouse. The meats were also of varying saltiness, with some of them being a bit too salty for my liking.   Salad bar was good but don't make the mistake of piling your plate there. After all, why would you pay $50 for raw and grilled veggies?   A bit nit-picky here, but I felt like the servers came inconsistently - at times, they would all come at once and there were moments when you'd be done with the meat and the next guy wouldn't come for at least a few minutes. Another complaint is that they don't have one of my favorite Brazilian bbq dishes - grilled pineapple with cinnamon!   It's not bad for what it is, but if you've had churrascia in ethnically Portuguese/Brazilian areas (like in Newark, NJ or Framingham, MA), you could do better for about half the price.",

All the meat has wonderful flavor and it's all very tender.   What was even better is that the service here is pretty incredible. They all work as a team so there's multiple people that will service your table. The managers come over to make sure your experience is great as well.   Only complaint is that regular drinks (soda, limeade) were not included in the price. Desserts are understandably extra (and well worth it!)

Then we thought we might as well eat the meats. Pathetic! Tough,overly salted,and just horrible. We will never return!",

We walked right in and they immediately sat us.   The food was amazing. They have a salad type bar where you can get everything from fresh and sauteed veggies to candied bacon. The best part was all the delicious meat you can eat which is cooked to your liking. Even my 4 year old said she loved the food.   I took off one star for 2 reasons... 1) They have a system which incorporates \"drink coaster\" like cardboard circles in which one side is green (to tell them keep the meat coming) and one side is red (to tell them you don't need food at the moment). Even while our coasters were flipped to green, they would still pass our table. There seemed to be a single corner of the restaurant in which they were focusing on, leaving others to sit and wait until they eventually decided they wanted to come our way. 2) Their alcoholic drinks are WAY overpriced for what they are. I ordered a drink that was MAYBE 4 ounces (most of which seemed to be ice) and they charged me $14 for it. The drink was just ok. Definitely not worth the $14 for sure.   Other than that, I'd return again for any other special occasion.",

The meats are really prepared with great flavors. My favorites were the filet mignon, the lamb, and the ribeye. The salad bar was stocked with great cheeses, peppers, salamis, and other tasteful goodies. It was our 30th wedding anniversary and we chose the right place to go. The staff were absolutely the best. If you haven't tried it yet this is a MUST DO for everyone.",

    "text": "This place is awesome. This is the first Fogo I've been to, but I've spent some time in Brazil and have had \"real\" BBQ. As with most Brazilian BBQ places, the strategy is to stay away from the salad bar and just load up on meat. Having said that, their salad bar is very fresh and is loaded with some pretty interesting items. The asparagus was cooked perfectly (something I need with beef for some reason).   One of the drawbacks from places like this is overcooked meat. I prefer Medium rare to rare for high quality beef and the servers are more than willing to find you steaks that are cooked to your liking. You're not going to get anything too exotic to choose from like you would in Brazil...i.e...chicken hearts, but it's a nice place in a convenient location. Of course this is in Scottsdale, so you know it's more upscale than it probably needs to be, and that's fine with me.",

    "text": "Alright, I'm going to make this as short and sweet as possible. If you're vegan or vegetarian, yes there's a giant salad bar for you, but don't waste your time and money. If you're a meat eater but mostly fish or chicken because red meat is soooo bad for you. Go jog to your favorite sushi bar and fill up on those cute little morsels.  If you are a True carnivore.  I mean you embrace the fact that we have been blessed with canine teeth for the ripping and shredding of flesh.  If you pass by a farm filled with cows and you don't notice the smell of poop and moreover you are suddenly blazing a trail to Carl's Jr for a $6 burger.  If you look longingly at your local butcher's apron and think about sucking that fabric clean.  Well my friends, Fogo de Chao is for you.               Now the place if very nicely adorned.  Staff very professional.  Prices are pretty high.  But at the heart of it beats a BBQ joint.  Here's the deal:  The salad bar is awesome.  All of the various extras they bring by your table, delicious.  Having said that, only a fool partakes in those features of this restaurant.  This is all you can eat meat, off a skewer, and when the gauchos come by carving off every type of meat imaginable, you better not have filled up on fluff!  You can get all that other stuff at a million restaurants.  But you cannot get meat like this anywhere else.              The meat is so simply prepared, just heat and salt used as ingredients.  But don't let that fool you into thinking it's boring.  While I admit, I am a sauce man.  Love all kinds and love it all over my BBQ, no matter what kind of meat.  This meat is of superior quality, and so there is very little needed to be done to it to make it taste fantastic.  Look, I can go on and on about the tasty virtues of their perfectly cooked meats.  All you need to know is say yes to every hunk of protein brought by on a sword until you are ready to burst.  Then force down the Creme Brulee, it really is pretty damn good!",

At about $50 per person it is pricey but the beef has awesome flavor and it's all you can eat so get your grub on.   If you Vegetarian, you can get just the salad bar and it is still incredible. I can't give this place enough stars since it is the only restaurant that easily pleases both Carnivores and vegetarians!   I've been to this location several times and each time the food has been amazing. The truly greatest thing about this place is the consistency. Each time we have gone the service, food and experience has been the same. Amazing.   My personal Favorite is the House special. It has great flavor and is mouthwatering. The lamb is also great. each cut is great in it's own unique way. If you like well done or rare, ask the server and they will ensure you get it. Believe me you won't regret trying this place.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to dine here for our anniversary. He loves Brazilian steak houses so naturally we were knowledgable on the process. We were sat at one of the tables tucked away in the back. It felt as if we were isolated from the restaurant. Our server, who was a younger woman, greeted our table and was very short with us. She briefly debriefed us on the process of the restaurant an said we can ask any one of the servers if we needed anything during our course of dining. I thought that was a bit unusual, but I was happy that we already knew what to do from past experiences. We had the wine list open and were waiting over 10 minutes to get someone attention to order. A server never came so we decided to give up and just go to the salad bar. Half way through our salad a server came to our table and asked if we wanted anything to drink. At this point we were already annoyed since we were waiting a long period of time to get someone's attention. I declined to our server and said that we would not be ordering any drinks for the evening. We had our green card faced up for a longer period of time before having anyone come to our table. I think it could of been due to the fact that we were placed in an unusual area of the restaurant. We began to keep our green card up for the entire period of time we were sitting at the table so that whenever a server would pass by they would see. By the end of our dining experience we were just extremely disappointed and ready to go home. We received little to no attention at this restaurant that requires a good degree of attention. I will probably not return to dine here again. Very bad experience.",

There was a Picanha (the prime part of the sirloin) which was gorgeous, Filet Mignon, Beef Ancho, Lombo (pork loin filets encrusted with parmesan cheese!), Frango chicken wrapped in bacon...yay, Linguica (slow-roasted pork sausages) and my favorite, Cordeiro, the leg of lamb, moist and delicious!

Come hungry and be prepared to leave fighting for your next breath (because you are full, duh)  Word of advice, be judicious with your choices at the salad bar, or you my not be able to savor each cut of meat that comes around.  For some reason, that elusive filet mignon seems to arrive when you've nearly had enough.  The salad bar is stuffed full of things that are not salad (of course it has various salads and dressings too).  Smoked salmon, Spanish Manchego cheese, and various fruits to name a few.  Another thing, also do not scarf down the rolls they bring to the table the first thing you do when you sit down...they are so good you'll keep eating them.  Lastly, just forget counting calories or trying to be healthy... accept the fact that this dinner is a treat and you'll work out some other time.",

Now I love me some cow and chicken just like the next person, but the salad bar is what it's all about for me.  I've eaten there three times over the past four months, and the one word that comes to mind: Consistency.  Fogo de Chao not only delivers the same great food time after time, they have EXCELLENT customer service.  Wanna know how good it is? My husband and I had a bit of a challenge transitioning our 6 month old son (now 8 months old) from the bottle onto other foods. On our first visit to Fogo de Chao, a relative offers up \"give him a lamb bone\"... so we do, and he LOVED it.  In fact, my husband had to fight the kid to get it back out of his hand (True story!).  If you are looking for a way to sample several cuts of meat while being fulfilled by an incredible salad bar, Fogo de Chao just might be the place for you.  Oh, and the desserts are amazing.  My ONLY gripe about this place is that they don't offer bottomless fountain drinks for the non-alcoholics like myself.  If you like Coke, Sprite, diet, etc, be prepared to pay $2.50 a pop (no pun intended) every time they bring one of those little 6oz bottles out to your table.  I guess they figure if you can pay big bucks for the dinner, what's a few more bucks for a soft drink?  My recommendation: come HUNGRY, or you will waste your hard-earned money.",

    "text": "My boyfriend had raved about this place for awhile so back when Phoenix Restaurant Week rolled around and Fogo de Chao was featured as one of the participating restaurants a group of us gathered together to go experience a Brazilian steakhouse.   It was packed, which was to be expected as usually this place is on the pricey side, and I think there was some problem with our reservation but it was sorted out and we were seated in short order.   Now I was just here for the meat but after some prodding I decided to do a loop around the salad bar so I could say I experienced everything. Man, what a salad bar! They had everything from fruits to and veggies and the regular old salad with lots of dressing options to meats and cheeses and whatever else you could possibly want.   When you're ready for the meat to come to you, you flip over a little round card that is given to every place at the table. Red means no, green means come at me boys! This signals the servers walking around with skewers of different meats to stop by and ask if you'd like a slice. The answer is always yes yes yes! I tried to try one of everything and between the chicken, steak, pork, and lamb I had a menagerie of animals on my plate. Everything was succulent and juicy and the best part was with some of the meats you could tell them how done you wanted it and they would flip to the appropriate section to slice you off a piece.   There is of course a moment when a lady decides that there is simply too much meat to fit into her mouth anymore and with some reluctance I flipped my card around to red to stop my stomach from bursting.   The cherry on top of this sundae was that our restaurant week flat price included a choice of one of three desserts and it was delicious.   I would definitely recommend this place to those of you wanting to try something new and the price point makes it a great special occasion restaurant. (I know where I want to go on my upcoming anniversary!)",

    "text": "Fogo De Chao deserves a solid 4 stars for my experiences there. However, the salad bar deserves like 5 or 6 stars - there is no better salad bar in town!  The meal comes in two phases: salad bar and meat like most Brazilian steakhouses. You get a little coaster type button that you put up on one color while you eat salad and another color while you eat meat. While this is happening you get side dishes and drinks. My favorite side dish is the bananas, AMAZING. When you are ready for the meat - meat carvers will come to your table to offer you various cuts and cooking temperatures. They have every kind of steak, plus lamb and chicken. The steak is very good here, but it is not the best I've had even in Arizona, hence the 4 star review instead of 5.   It is so hard not to over eat here, so I recommend coming hungry, and don't skip the amazing salad bar because you are looking forward to steak!",

    "text": "I came to Fogo de Chao for AZ Restaurant Week in 2010.  The first disclaimer is that you have to be a serious meat eater if you want to enjoy all the benefits.  I do not eat beef as a Hindu, but I was actually able to enjoy quite a bit of the experience.  I got an opportunity to eat really good BBQ Chicken, sausage, a hybrid chicken-pork dish, and several seafood items from the buffet tray.    Fogo de Chao is very similar to tradition Brazilian BBQ.  I have actually been to a Brazilian BBQ in Rio, so I know this was very authentic.  You start off at the salad bar which has other small items such as cheese, seafood, and fruit.  You have quite a wide array of seafood to enjoy for non-red meat eaters.  You then sit down in your table and you get a button.  Green means bring it on!  Red means, stop for now or game over!  If you have your button turned to green, you will get constantly questioned about food.  I made this mistake in Brazil, and I had everyone and their mom come to my table asking if I wanted food.  I was so into the food, I didn't realize this simple little rule.  Once you want to call it quits for good, you get a selection of a few desert items.  I think Fogo de Chao does a good job replicating the traditional Brazilian BBQ.  The quality of food is very similar from what my red-meat eating friends tell me.  This is a good taste of Brazilian BBQ if you do not want to travel all the way to Brazil.",

He always greets us and chats.  He has made us feel welcome every time we have visited, checks in with us to see if we are okay and thanks us for coming when leaving.  On special occasions we are given the dessert menu and are asked to order anything we want. Now what restaurant does that? When you arrive the waiters bring you hot cheese puffs as soon as you are seated as well as warm Polenta sticks, mashed potatoes,and fried bananas.  I must say the Polenta sticks are to die for as well as the cheese puffs.   We love the market table for lunch.  Its only $15 with all you can eat.  There are many choices of salads,i.e. kale, Caesar, Bib lettuce, chicken & potato salad, cheeses, meats i.e. salami, Prosciutto, nova lox, apple fruit salad, hearts of palm, fresh cooked beets, asparagus, zucchini, and many more items. The basil dressing is my favorite. The full experience encompasses several sirloin cuts of meat, leg of lamb and lamb chops. rib eye, filet, pork, chicken, & ribs.  The full experience is around $32 for lunch and $50 for dinner.  Its worth every dime.  Many times on holidays they offer a $25 gift card to return.  They are constantly promoting specials for your return and believe me, you will want to return time and time again.",

Now this is a steal by whatever measurement you can come up with.   Consider that across the street, Fleming's starts at $44.99 for their Prime Rib dinner; same is True for Ruth's Chris or any of the other steak places in town.   Now don't get me wrong. I am not saying that Fogo de Chao Brazilian's quality is in the same league as Ruth's Chris, Morton's, the Capital Grille or Dominick's; but it as good, if not better than anything we've had a Fleming's. See review.  The other thing that's pretty cool about Fogo de Chao Brazilian's is the entertainment of the Fogo experience -- when their Gauchos start coming around after you turn that card up green. Priceless.    The four of us had a great time. The bill came to $230.50, not including taxes and gratuities.   Enjoy!",

When I saw they had a restaurant here in Scottsdale I decided to take my brother in law there for dinner. The menu offered a large array of meats as part of the \"experience\", as well as a bountiful salad bar. The hostess asked if we would also like the shrimp and lobster appetizer and we agreed to order that along with the experience. The appetizer was mediocre at best. Served cold with a red sauce and the melted butter arrived when we were half through. The shrimp were large and the lobster tail was small and two very large claws were also on the plate but obviously came from a larger lobster, not the one where the tail came from. All were tasteless and the melted butter did little to improve that.  The menu offered filet and tenderloin along with chicken, pork, lamb and lesser cuts of steak as part of the experience. Some of these were garlic infused as well as bacon wrapped. The meats were average at best. Most tougher than I usually experienced. Not very flavorful except for the lamb. When I asked for some filet and tenderloin they said they would bring some. None was ever offered in the 39 to 45 minutes we were seated, as they continued around with the touger cuts of meat. Then the filet arrived. It was not a filet, rather a sirloin cut to look like one. The tenderloin never made it to the table. Did they have one? Its expensive to eat there for the meat you are offered. I would get the same or better for a fifth of the price for two at Longhorn Steak.  They need to fo better.",

When we got home, after picking up the kids, I noticed I was missing my phone!! I left it at the restaurant!! I started going crazy and called the restaurant no one had seen it or turned it in. So I asked if I could go and look for it. My husband and I spoke to Christoper, he said of course! Well we live a good 25 mins from the restaurant. Christopher not only stuck around after his shift, he helped me look for it and it was found wrapped in the linen already packed ready to go! He pulled out the bag from its bin, thanks to the findmyiphone beep it makes, and took out the linens to get my phone! Thank you so much Christopher!! You didn't have to help me, especially for just a phone, but you did and I am so grateful!!",

    "text": "Fun experience if you've never gone before.  Traditional Brazilian steakhouse where they walk around with a variety of meats beef, lamb, pork and chicken. They stop at your table throughout the evening and slice the meat table side.The meal also includes a wonderful market bar that is full of a variety of salads, cheeses, and more. I am not much into meat so I opted to go just with the market bar. You do have the option to order a fish entree as well. I was pleased with the meal and enjoyed trying some new dishes I had never had before. The gentleman in our group said they liked the \"house specialty\" a top sirloin and the bacon wrapped chicken the best. Dinner was concluded with a yummy chocolate fudge cake.",

    "text": "Fogo de Chao great decision to come here with some small minor mishaps. This is a Brazilian steak house. The meal options at this location is a fixed menu.  They do the Rodizo and that's it so if you're not a meat person I don't suggest this place. We as a group had to order sangria and it was very good wish it had more fruit besides just apples to have sitting in it. Once then we decided to venture to the salad bar , be aware to not fill up to much on the salad and sides. I suggest trying the apple potato salad and roasted peppers. All side dishes are included in the meal  which are garlic mashed potatoes, polenta (which was out of this world) and fried bananas which you can never go wrong with. Now the Brazilian steak Rodizio experience. Some quirks of the meal. At your seat they give you a red and green coaster which red means \"no more meat\" and green \"bring on the meat\". Might have just been where I was sitting at the table but I was sitting at the far end of the table. My coaster was unable to be seen. So the meat cutters walking around would only see a portion of the table and pass by and not check the whole group. Multiple times people at the far end of the table were missed. To the meat my favorite of the filet, top sirloin, bottom sirloin and lamb was definitely the bottom sirloin the flavor was out of this world. The side dishes  but the best of the sides was the polenta. Keep in mind they are complimentary and if you just ask they will bring more, but they did forget a few times when asked. Now to dessert we decided on a pineapple with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream which was out of this world and a to die forCREME BRULEE. Overall some plus and minuses to this meal, but definitely worth trying if in the area or other locations across the country.",

    "text": "Hubby and I celebrate our birthdays kind of close to each other and Fogo de Chao is one of my favorites birthday places. Sign up for their email list, read the fine print on the birthday offer they send and you will see. We got $25 off for lunch or dinner churrasco experience, plus birthday dessert. Vanessa was our server this time and she was amazing, Brian assisted her too. I did not get names for our gauchos but pretty much everyone was awesome this time around.  Our favorite always are the beef ribs, which I do not think they bring regularly to the tables, we always ask for them (even more than once).  The salad bar was a little different but it had solid options, we also noticed the meats had different offerings but did not pinpoint all the changes. My best advice for this place is to be very conservative with the salad bar, and start with super small portions of all the meats the gauchos bring to your table, and I mean tiny. Then once you try a few (or all of them) you can ask for little bigger portions of your favorites. Enjoy!  PS The only down side for me here is that they do not offer the grilled pineapple like some other churrasco places do. : (",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse for a long time. I took advantage of AZ restaurant week, made the reservations on Open Table at 7p.m. Saturday night. Plenty of parking, there was no need to use the valet. We were greeted right away when we arrived on time for our reservation. We were then handed a buzzer and told when our table was ready it will buzz and it wouldn't be long. We waited about 15 minutes.  As we walked to our table, we took note of a lot of large family parties, dates and small groups of tables. The restaurant was filled and loud. My only negative feel was that it felt like a land cruise ship dining room (food for the masses). We were seated at a perfect table for 2 against the wall. It was perfect because there weren't servers and people walking all around us to get to the Market Table (Salad Bar). Our waiter came over right away, explained how the variety of meats are served, Market Table and Sides included. Then he took our cocktail orders.   Now let the games begin! We had the Top Sirloin, Lamb Chops, Pork Ribs, Filet Mignon wrapped in Bacon, Pork Sausage, Sirloin, all requested at medium rare and we got it perfectly done. The Market Table and sides of Mash Potatoes, Cheesy Bread, Fried Plantain and Fried Polenta w/Parmesan Cheese all included and tasted very good. Dessert (I chose the Cheesecake) was part of the restaurant week deal, very OK.  Service was excellent! Cocktails excellent. Meats that we tried were excellent. Market Table and Sides were all very good. Dessert very OK and Atmosphere OK. Worth going for the experience.",

This means you have no personal attention or customer service. 2. At times you there's no meats being served. At one point I was waiting 15 minutes before I had something to eat(the salad bar was boring). 3. The salad bar was boring, for the price I would expect more items with actual flavor. 4. Came for anniversary, just ignored by the servers and managers while all around us people were getting desserts for their birthdays. Hmmmmm... 5. Meats where way over cooked, filet mignon was more like pulled beef, awful. 6. Never saw sausage, beef ribs or good filet mignon. Pros: 1. To me the sirloin was the best cut of meat. 2. The soup in the salad bar. Lol  Was it worth the $120? Not at all!!! Ruined such a special day, I guess we were looking at this place being the highlight but left us disappointed that we spent that much.

The salad bar is extensive and very fresh. The meats were generally tasty...there were a few that were better than others, of course, but nothing bad. The restaurant provided a free dessert (it was my anniversary) which was very nice and unnecessary. The price is high (about 60$ pp at dinner), especially if you can't eat a lot. I personally prefer a restaurant where I just order one perfectly prepared steak versus this scenario in which I get an abundance of pretty good meat, but if you're a buffet fan and can eat a lot, this is the place for you!",

We did the full experience and it felt like the meat options were limited from what the menu offered. Felt like that was misinformation and they should edit the kinds of meats they actually have.   The salad bar was wonderful. Definitely loved the smoked salmon and quinoa salad. The pork belly was moist and cooked well and the side dishes on the table were fine enough.   I'm putting my review to three stars. Knocked off two because of the service. We were left waiting around for the meats to come by and when we asked for a dessert menu and coffee, waited THIRTY minutes just to have someone come by to check on us. We ended up passing on dessert and asked for the check.   Check out is digital and you can swipe your card right then and there. Two of us had cash on hand-so we waited ANOTHER TEN-FIFTEEN minutes just to have someone check on us again so we can get cash.   For the price of what we were paying at this restaurant, I was expecting nothing less than stellar customer service. I was very much wrong. I'll probably come back if there's an occasion that warrants it or someone wants to go, but not any time soon.",

They always made sure if we had enough water, if we needed more sides, and etc. The guys who served the meat were very nice too. I enjoyed the all you can eat salad bar. There was many choices to pick from with different kinds of salads and sauces. We also ordered the shrimp and lobster appetizer was amazing because they tasted so fresh.

    "text": "I checked out Fogo for the first time at a work outing. Being a meat lover, I was beyond excited for this experience! Here's the details:  Pros:  *Fully stocked salad bar makes it friendly for any crowd.  *Selection of various meats you are able to sample and try is unparalleled from any other experience. *Staff is responsive and friendly. You can select when you want to participate or sit out of a round of meat comes through.   Cons: *Pace was borderline frantic, and almost too fast. Creates an atmosphere of FOMO, so you keep saying yes and then your plate piles up.  *Meats were tailored to the masses and more conservative vs. what I'd normally order with most \"well done\". Even when they'd ask, they'd cut you off a similar piece for medium rare as the guy that asked for well done. The ribs were WAY over cooked, and it was like chewing on a dog bone. Definitely speaks to \"quantity over quality\".  *More on that note- I think I would rather have 1 perfectly cooked cut of meat vs. having multiple sub par presentations. Results in stimulation overload, and at the end of the day, you feel bloated and like you overdid it.   Overall, would probably pass on an opportunity to come back. I'm glad I got to experience this, but once is definitely enough!",

If you haven't been to a Brazilian restaurant, they bring around various beautiful cuts of meat cooked to perfection. You signal the waitstaff when you want more by flipping a coaster: green is go and red is no. Not only is the meat exceptional, but there is also an unlimited salad bar that is a destiny in itself. We chose this place for my Dad's 80th birthday and they treated us like royalty. Our waitstaff consisted of three, yes a team, of servers that were very attentive. Destinee, Lilly, and Favi were a class act. Cocktails are marvelous too. Certainly not going to wait for a special occasion to go back!",

    "text": "My fiancee, son and I went here for dinner on Christmas Day. The food was good and the meat a little overdone, but well-seared and served hot. The servers were outstanding! but the atmosphere is lacking. The place was too brightly lit and the tables and chairs placed so close togather it reminded me of a big cafeteria. My adult son had been ill and only ate a fraction of what he normally would. He had quite a bit of food left on his plates, especially the meat, and could not finish. I knew it would get thrown in the garbage, so I explained his situation and requested if there was some way they could take it in the back and package it so he could enjoy it when he was feeling better. I realize that was probably against the rules, however, I was hoping for a little professional courtesy. At $53 each, the fact that his leftover food was going to be thrown out was upsetting. (He only ate a couple bites of meat and a small amount of the food on his \"sides\" plate~the least they could've done was offer to charge him the Market price, at $23 less.) Also, the price of a 6-oz. bottle of Coke was $3.50 and he had two before we thought to ask and were told no free refills on soft drinks. So the total for his meager meal without tax/tip was $60! Also, no one explained there was rice, mashed potatoes, bean soup, and other hot food on the back bar behind the salads/cold items. They did bring a dish of mashed potatoes to the table which I thought came from the kitchen, and we didn't discover the hot sides until we were leaving. Should we return again, I would just do the Market Place area. It had a decent selection of cold gourmet foods and I especially loved the cheeses, however, I would have liked to try the hot food also. Although other good buffets at the same price ($30) would also include all of the entrees, meats and desserts. If anyone could even handle dessert after trying to eat all the food that is offered, it is not included in the full meal price.",

It was extremely sub-par, especially for how the establishment attempts to present themselves (professional.)  I can't even count the number of times that our party of 6 had to be told repeatedly (i.e. at least 3 times on each occasion,) that the specific item we were asking for would be \"right out\"...or \"it was cooking, should be here any minute\"...or any other excuse they could deliver us at the time.  Not just the meat/entree's - no...we had to wait over 30 minutes just for BREAD.  There was no flow to our meal, it was haphazard at best.  I don't expect 100% organization in any establishment - especially one where there a a myriad of servers/specialties running around.  But my experience went far beyond reasonable in the opposite direction of organized chaos.  This was a complete service failure.  Not to be outdone in failures - it took almost 20 minutes (not an exaggeration,) JUST to get our check.  Since it was my first time at Fogo de Chao, I don't know if this was just a fluke or their are staffing issues (new) at the establishment, or both!  But for the expense and time involved in an outing to Fogo - I can't see myself being willing to risk it in the future.  Now, if you have all the time in the world (our meal went 3 hours and 20 minutes!) - then by all means, go enjoy the most awesome food you could ask for.  Just be ready to work for it.",

The steaks are delicious but the chicken (which I normally don't care for) was by far my favorite.   Now on to the important portion of my review... The customer service was AMAZING!! Our waitress was nice, and (I forget what the term is) the mean cutting guys were all pleasant and helpful but Lou the customer service manager was just the best! I read about him on other reviews so out of all the staff helping us I had to ask him his name because I just KNEW he was the Lou everyone was raving about. He waits, serves, takes orders, busses, he does everything!   ALL of the staff was amazing. Especially with our fussy 1 year old. They rinsed her bottle for us and filled it with warm water so we could make another bottle and not to mention waived all the drink fees (just 1 Coke and 1 mojito but still a nice surprise). We will definitely be back :)",

Rare medium rare medium ... Don't know if they serve ruined. They just keep coming with meat until you say done. I overdosed. Definitely recommend for meat lovers and a fun time.

They mostly kept up with delivering the meat when the cards were flipped to green but occasionally they slacked and we were kept waiting a few minutes with empty plates. Many times we also had empty glasses in need of filling that took waaaaaayyyyyy too long. I have ate at three Fogo restaurants and an off brand Brazilian steakhouse and this was by far my least favorite.  The meat selections were just not as good and well prepared as other locations I have visited. I will not say it was bad though, some of the selections were good, just kinda hit and miss. The salad bar here was also lacking when compared to others, a lot less selections and options....not a big deal with me as the salad offerings are not what I come for.  Still a decent option to visit in Phoenix but try the Houston or Sao Paulo Brazil locations.... will blow your socks off.",

This is the 2nd time I've eaten here in a couple of months and my first time here was much better.  The meats were all good, the shrimp cocktail was great.  4 people in my party got cheesecake and they were all different sizes and totally different amounts of strawberry topping.  3 of us for the tres leches cake and they were all different sizes and one was almost soupy? Coffee was brought out without cream and spoons.  Just not typical for a Fogo dinning experience.  We came in late (830pm)  so maybe that's why we got the subpar experience.

The food was so mediocre. If I am spending 50 dollars per person, plus drinks i expect real mashed potatoes with my food. I do not want potato spuds. It was a waste of money. I would rather go to a small restaurant with excellent food than a large overrated one. 100 percent equivalent to a las Vegas buffet. The meat was fatty, drinks were not good. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews on all of these different places, I feel like it is my duty to be truthful on here! I was not expecting a steakhouse quality meal for the price, but left feeling jipped. Bill for two came out to $165.00. I guess it's a quantity over quality type business. They give so much food, but none of it is delicious. Will not be back.",

The salad bar has plenty to choose from, try a little bit of everything. Great selection. The service is ok/good, but occasionally we had to flag our waiter down.

This the only Fogo de Chao location I've visited. I'm thrilled that they are open for lunch. I sometimes meet my hubby there (now, he IS a carnivore and makes up for me not eating much meat). It's not crowded, service and food selection are still great, and it's cheaper. Also, kids 5 and under are free. Unfortunately for them, my four year old eats everything. She's in heaven here.  I still think I prefer Texas de Brazil b/c their plantains and potatoes are better. But, Fogo de Chao has palenta. The salad bar area and meats are about equal.   I did notice that the meats are cooked more than some of the other Brazilian steakhouses. More medium-well. The bacon-wrapped filet was great!",

I like this restaurant over the San Diego location. The tables are spaced out, and are definitely more accessible, you arent side-stepping between customers/servers trying to venture to the salad  bar or to your own table.  They have a drink service constantly going around? Something I'm definitely not used to. That was so incredibly convenient. The service was superb and the servers very friendly.

I had to tell them that we would let them know if everything wasn't okay and to allow us to enjoy our meal.

My wife and I decided to go celebrate a special occasion at Fogo de Chao to celebrate her passing the CPA exam.  We were both excited to go and try it out based on the reviews we had read.  I'm not really sure if we ended up hitting an off night but disappointing for a $150 dollar meal...  Let me say, first off, it wasn't all bad.  The interior is great, and staff, very professional.  The salad bar was very good, but ended up being the highlight of the evening. The fresh bread that they brought out and drinks were very good, however, when we flipped our cards over and began receiving meat, our disappointment began.  I love medium rare, not rare, and not well done meat. Every time I asked for a streak, I would ask for medium rare, and would ALWAYS get medium well to well.  I don't believe there was ever any pink in any of my steaks.  The chicken was overcooked and at times had to scrape the chard skin flakes off  before eating. Even the lamb came out slightly overdone, but edible.  unfortunately I am not a huge fan of lamb, I came for the steaks and expected more.  We tried every piece of meat on the menu in an attempt to find something worth the 50 dollars a plate we were paying, After about an hour, we discovered that the filet (not the bacon wrapped) while request medium rare, was closer to medium instead of burnt. Finally something besides salad and the sides worth eating.  Would I recommend this place to anyone?  For the price, absolutely not.  I could have gotten a much better meal for the price I paid at Ruth Chris, or any other steak house for that matter,  In addition, if any steakhouse had served me a well done steak instead of my requested medium rare, I would have simply sent it back to the kitchen.  My only option in this case was disappointment as I sampled all the available choices.  Overall, the only way I would ever come back to this place would be for a free.  I really hope I just hit an off night or something based on the reviews or people are diluting themselves. You'd have to be crazy to drop this type of money here with all the great places to eat around Fogo de Chao.",

You dont have just one waiter, no. You have like 6. And thats just for your drinks. The chefs come out with different meats constantly so you never have an empty plate. The food here is to die for. We come here for birthdays and holidays and are never disappointed. You pay a flat rate for your meals here and get more than your moneys worth. Lunch is about $15 cheaper and there is no difference between it and dinner. I recommend this place constantly to friends and co workers. Everyone should experience this place at least once in their lifetime.",

Their salad bar is definitely the worst  salad bar I have ever tried. Bland, gross, cheap. The meat was gross too. I tried nearly  all of them and was Super disappointed. Dry, chewy, lacked flavor. For $50 a plate I expected at least slightly better than average food. No joke, I would have had a better meal at a $19.99 vegas buffet. Next time I want to spend $50 on one plate I will head over to Flemmings. Never a bad meal there!",

Some of the meats they didn't bring around, but if you requested them they cooked a skewer to get it for you. The lamb t-bones were unbelievable, each bite was a small orgasm in the mouth. The filet Mignon varied, the first skewer was excellent the second one they brought around was still good and tender but not as good as the first. The bacon wrapped filet was delicious as well each time they brought it around.  Definitely an experience worth repeating!",

The foods are 110% perfect.  Nothing wrong either in service or food.  Never.  Then I came to Scottsdale.  It was good.  But that's about all I can say.  The salad bar was actually better than the meats, which were amazing also.  Delicious pastas and vegetables laid out in a wide variety.  The gauchos who came to our table, along with the waiter/waitress staff, were great.  Very helpful, friendly and courteous.  The meats, however, just didn't match up with Beverly Hills.  Again, that's not saying something was wrong, they just weren't as good.  The Picanha (house special awesomeness meat) was good, but was lacking whatever magic put it on the map.    I'm not disappointed, but for $150 for 2 people, I was actually hoping for better.  In fact, I was actually turned off from enjoying their famous Creme Brulee.  Le Sigh.",

Not that other Fogo's are not, but this one is the nicest of the ones I've been to.  The service at this one is excellent!  And they really appreciate my few Portuguese phrases!  Muito Obrigado goes a long way here...  Finally, as I have come to expect from Fogo de Chao, the food is excellent.  Of course, if you don't like mouthwatering, perfectly cooked meat right off the skewer, then this place probably isn't for you.

Seriously your stomach better be growling like a beast, your feet must be tapping on the ground anxiously, and you HAVE to be begging for meat-heaven when you come to this place.  Only then will you be able to make your money's worth.  That being said, this restaurant is very fancy and very expensive. But it's worth it for the meat and for the sheer satisfaction of it all. Each meat is cooked to perfection making sure each bite is flavorful and distinct- different from the other ones. My favorite would have to be the Special and the Chicken.. something.  I never really caught the names of the meat since I was too busy drooling as the waitress brings them to my table. Sorry.  Now, the salad bar must not be left behind either. The apple salad is just amazingly scrumptious and crunchy and the rest of the vegetables is fresh. Definitely stock up on the vegetables because it prevents you from getting sick off of meat-overload.  I had the Brazilian Lemonade to drink and it was the best lemonade EVER. It was sweet, tangry, smooth, and juicy.",

Here is our experience.... have you ever been to a place where the waiters almost annoy you too much?? This is the place. We could not go without having someone either ask to take our plate, ask us if we are done, ask us if we want a certain meat (that did not help at all by the way), ask us if we want potatoes etc... every minute. very annoying.. and they must have had like 15 waiters working.... the other issue was with the meat. Most of these places I have gone to have a good selection... but they seemed to bring the cheapest meat (top sirloin, sausage, and very dry chicken) about 80% of the time. If you are lucky enough to see something different it was normally gone by the time they came to our table. The eventually brought the beed rib and lamb to our table, but it did take a while. For the price you pay, I would never go back. If you are the manager and you are reading this, just tell the waiters to take a chill pill and relax.",

    "text": "I will start this review by stating that buffet, mass feeding type restaurants are not really my scene. If they were I would have given this a better star rating. By no means did I not enjoy myself, just not my type of place.   We were greeted with a very friendly host which can sometimes be challenging at Scottsdale establishments. We were seated very promptly at a table alongside the wall. I noticed that the windows are very high so you can't look outside unless you are taller. Not a deal breaker just interesting style of architecture with the builder.  The gentleman that came and explained the process of putting the green and red cards to start/stop the meat being brought around seemed rushed in his explanation and I had a hard time understanding exactly what he was saying because he spoke so quickly.   My best friend and I got up and survey and take in the salad bar. Nothing spectacular. I did find the potato salad was very good, and had some ingredient that made it pop a little more than your regular potato salad. The apple salad was very good too. I enjoyed a little bit of the cheese. The artichoke heart was very salty and not really my bag.   If I knew that sides were going to be brought to the table as soon as we turned our cards to green I would have not even hit the salad bar. The little round rolls they brought to the table reminded me of a favorite South American roll my stepmother always makes when I visit. These were much lighter though, almost cream puff texture. They were addictive!   The cuts of meat were all very good. I personally don't really eat meat so my stomach became quite full very quickly. I did notice that they came around very efficiently making sure we had plenty of meat. Our sides were replenished a few times when there was still quite a bit left. I thought this was a bit on the wasteful side as the food is thrown out, but that's just me.   I think this would be a great place to take a large group because it's fun and interactive. For dinner with just my friend and I it felt a little gimmicky but all of the servers and everyone working was very nice.",

    "text": "Today, I am giving Fogo de Chao the honor of being my 100th Yelp Elite review.  I ate here on Aug 31, 2017 for the very first time, for summer price of $45 instead of the $52, including prime cuts: lamb chops, filet mignon, ribeye, and beef ribs.  We were a group of 9 Wild Dining MeetUp Foodies.  The moment I put in my mouth, the lamb chops, ribeye, and filet mignon, my eyes rolled back into my head, in that \"to die for\" moment, that I KNEW WAS EXPERIENCING THE SAME \"HEAVEN\" THAT OTHER YELPERS DESCRIBED.  The meats were cooked very very RED, which is very hard for other restaurants to GET RIGHT(for ME) when I order \"rare or medium rare\" at other restaurants.  But here at Fogo, I can look at the color and pick where I want him to cut.  They KNOW how to cook these prime cuts, to me, savored only when very red/rare for most of the inside of their red meats.  To cook such premium meats medium and well-done is to me \"the poor cow gave us his life only to be vulcanized\".    ONLY here can I have all three expensive cuts of lamb chops, ribeye, filet mignon ALL on the SAME plate, at the same time!  How cool is that?    Yet, some of the other meats such as bacon-wrapped beef cubes, pork ribs, were as some disappointed Yelpers described, dry and over-cooked, leaving parts even unedible cos it is too hard (like plastic) to eat.   But not necessarily every time, maybe next time they come to the table with same item, that batch may not be not cooked as dry.  I only tasted 4-5 items at the Market Table salad bar, as I came for the premium meats.  But the marinated mushrooms, green beans (sweet and tender with no strings), hearts of palm, and smoked salmon with capers were ALL SOOO GOOD.  However I only ate those at the end of my dinner and I was alone, after everyone at my table.    When I got home, I realized I do not recall tasting the beef ribs, which employee Danielle, said was her favorite Fogo meat.  Next day I called the restaurant and was told by the manager, that you have to ASK for the beef ribs.  They do not bring the ribs to each table like the other meats, because they make very few, maybe only 15 ribs, because it takes 5 hours and they take up too much room on the grill, so other meats cannot be prepared.    The service was mostly wonderful.  Fogo seems to have picked the most upbeat and enthusiastic employees, like Danielle and Kaylee.  I do have one complaint about the service that makes me almost want to give 4 stars to this Yelp review.  Nine of us sat at a long table at the far rear of the restaurant, meaning 4 of us had our backs to the wall with enough space for someone to walk behind us.  ALL of us had our discs turned up to green, the entire time we dined there because our host said if we didn't, they would not even approach our table.  But SEVERAL of the meat servers only asked the people sitting across from me with their backs to the center of the dining room, what they wanted and cut for them.  But they did not ask the 4 of us with our backs to the wall, instead they quickly went away as if we did not exist before I could say \"Hey how about US?\"  It was almost as if \"they RAN away\".  Yet there was room for them to come behind us and ask each of us who had our backs to the back wall.  After a few times of them \"running away\" after serving the 5 across the table from me, I said to my neighbor, \"Hey they didn't even ask US and ran away.\"  She said, \"I am noticing the same behavior\".    So the next day, when the manager told me about why I did not see the beef ribs, I told him about them \"running away\".    He said that next time I come in, he would put us at a \"better table, more toward the center\".  I also said I was not the host at this dinner, another person was, and he waited for me and others at the front door, and showed us where our table was, and I have no knowledge how that table was \"assigned to us\".  I said that it shouldn't matter where the table is in the dining room, that all diners should be given the same service wherever they sit.  Also people at the same table who had their backs to the center, were served the meat, but people who had their backs to the rear wall, were not.  At least they could ASK us, like they ASKED the people sitting across from US.   He agreed and said that he would address this issue with the servers, and thanked me many times for my \"feedback\".    As I am typing, the \"getting it right with the ribeye, lamp chops, and filet mignon and enough of the other \"heavenly\" foods I ate here and the good service of the other employees, still outweighs this \"running away\" behavior, so I still feel good enough about giving Fogo 5 stars for my 100th review.  Why even the paper towels in the ladies room were \"gourmet\", having seen this type towel only at one other upscale place, the Phoenician Hotel.  I hope that I will not have the \"running away\" in my future visits, where I plan to come for full menu and EAT THE BEEF RIBS for weekday lunch for $35, in the future.",

We were seated after a 15 minute wait. The service was outstanding and the staff very friendly and attentive.  The wide variety of meat was tasty and well prepared.  The salad deck was running short on some items. Approximately 30 minutes into our dinner in walks an old bag with her dog and is seated in our general vicinity.  After a bit she began to feed the dog off her plate. I noticed a couple that asked to be seated elsewhere and once reseated she complained about the dog to the staff. I found it highly offensive to allow an animal that was not a service animal into the establishment.  My wife and I dropped $245 there for dinner and drinks. I will not return.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Fogo. My coworker and I talked about eating here for a good 3 months. When we finally had time to grab lunch together, this was the first place to come to mind! The salad and cheese bar is always great. Everything is gresh. But the best part about fogo is definitely their churrascaria experience! You get a flip card, one side is green and The other side is red. You flip to the green side when you're ready & flip it to red when you have enough meat on your plate or need a break!  The meat is always seasoned perfectly. There's workers who walk around with meat on a stick that come fresh off the grill. They ask how well you like your meat cooked & they slice is right off for you tableside. They also bring you sides which include mashed potatoes, fried polenta & fried bananas. Also, their bread is to die for. It's nice and crispy on the outside and nice and chewy, soft, cheesy & buttery on the inside. They literally just melt in your mouth. Very addicting!   They also offer a few other dishes if you're not big on the red meats or don't want the full churrascaria experience. You can also just dine here for the salad bar alone as well.   During their lunch service, it is slightly cheaper than dinner & they serve a most of the same cut of meat during lunch that they serve during dinner. Service was very quick here in the beginning as we sat down. After about 15 minutes, service started to slow down. Which was weird because the restaurant was only about 20% full at the time.",

He clearly knew he shouldn't be there and when I told the hostess she didn't care.  I was so annoyed with everything else I just left.  As for the rest, restaurant wasn't ready at opening, it happens.  then waiter rushes us, took our menus before we touched them.  I get the concept but I wanted to look at selections, prices, drinks!  Nope!  The food I had was good but didn't get to try many of the options.  Then at the end we sat there with cleared plates forever, no server, no check.  Finally a server came back, no check in hand to leave again and take even longer to bring it back.  that is when I left and had the bathroom incident while my husband stayed to pay (we met and took two cars)  I stopped at a pharmacy with a line and still beat him home by about 20 minutes and that was just to pay, not counting the other waits for this check.  Overall not worth the price, rather go to a good steakhouse pay a little more and get good service and no males in the bathroom.  If it was coed then that is fine but it wasn't and he clearly knew he shouldn't be in there, just odd.    Never again.",

There were a few additions to the market table area for brunch: waffles, bacon, breakfast potatoes, and what looked like an omelette station.   They have an extensive drink menu with many wines available should you be interested. Once we were seated the service was spot on; we had several servers check in on us throughout the meal to bring us drinks, switch out our plates, and deliver hot sides.  For those that may be new to the experience, you can make unlimited trips to the market table which has a large variety of veggies, fruit, cheese, smoked salmon, potato salad, apple salad, etc. You can also order unlimited hot sides which were mashed potatoes, caramelized banana, cheese bread and polenta. Then, various cuts of meat are walked around and if your indicator is on green, you can choose to indulge in some. You can flip your indicator to red when you want to take a break from meat.   Overall we really enjoyed our meal. While it is a little pricey, it's a fun experience for a special occasion and you definitely walk out stuffed! Some of our favorites were the signature cut, the filet, and the bacon wrapped steak. They definitely will have more cuts for the dinner crowd but we were still happy with the selection we saw during our lunch.",

Next came the hot side table. Cup of delicious ginger and squash soup. Very refreshing. Then a bowl of rice with the Brazilian stew on top, and a few slices of outrageous crispy Sweet bacon. For desert, helped myself to some fresh papaya slices, pineapple, bits of cheeses, fig jam and prosciutto. The really nice servers kept us supplied with fried polenta and bananas. The floor mgr David checked on us, they really gave first class treatment for a couple of old dudes from Chandler! A truly wonderful meal for $ 25 tax and tip inc. We might be back next week!",

Food/meat was absolutely fantastic, cooked to perfection and of course the buzzing staff were always asking if there was anything particular we desired. I have to preface that I'm from MN so was a little taken back at the salad bar at this location -- they didn't have the apple salad that I love but it could be a regional thing. Just like how this location offered grilled pineapple which isn't a thing in our Minneapolis location so that was neat. Only sad part keeping me from five stars is the selection of meats wasn't as broad and they kept bringing out the same 4 things but that may have been cause it was lunch but I expected the same full menu as that's what was presented and paid for.",

I made the decision to rec' my aunt to go here instead of Mastro since it is a unique experience and she has never tried it before. I warned her in advance the steak quality is not anywhere close to Mastro.  Anyway, the steak was so chewy. It was like eating rubber. I am in school so I got steak from Wal-mart before, and this steak was worse than Wal-mart steak. The chicken was like eating straight up salt. The papaya ice cream had very little papaya flavor. The sausage was so dry. Overall, it was  not worth the $55. We wish we should have gone to Mastro instead.",

    "text": "Met one of my gal pals here for lunch the other day armed with a gift card that said it was for \"one lunch.\"   I showed the gift card to Ken, who happened to be the first server for our table.   I asked him what all I could order off the lunch menu since I didn't want to be surprised by ordering something and then finding out later, when the bill arrived, that whatever I ordered was not covered with said card.   He assured me that everything on the lunch menu was covered.   (more about that later!)   With that pronouncement in mind, I waited for my friend to arrive.     Unless one orders from the \"market table,\" the lunch menu is rather expensive.  I perused the menu.   I was not in the mood for beef so decided on the chilean sea bass lunch ($28 before tax and tip) and thought I'd like to have the jumbo shrimp cocktail, which comes with six shrimp ($21.50 sans tax and tip.)    She decided on the \"market table.\"   It has the various greens for a salad plus an assortment of cheese and cold cuts.    I definitely was not in the mood for that either.  The sea bass was superb!  That is all I can say about that.   Cooked and flavored to absolute perfection.   The accompanying relish tasted like apricot and was perfect.  I was not impressed with the accompanying potatoes.   I believe they were fried sweet potato sticks and some other sort of potato.  The potato sticks were hard and I didn't like whatever the other potato was.  I forgot to mention cute little rolls are put on the table to eat as one deliberates what to order.   They were soft and buttery.  I am accompanying this review with a photo of what my friend got from the wagon.  Back to the use of the gift card.   Ken came back and apologized that the gift card was no good on what I ordered.   None of it.  WHAT???!!!   I reminded him that he told me it was.  I could tell that my friend was starting to feel uncomfortable.   Not wanting to make a scene, I paid the bill, and we left.   I decided I'd take care of this little problem later.  Later that day I called and asked to talk to the manager.   Rodrigo came on the line and I explained what had happened.   I returned that evening and he credited me for the fish, but said the shrimp didn't count as lunch, even though it is not under a section labeled \"appetizer.\"   I figured what the heck and went with it.  I am glad this little mishap was taken care of.   I do like the restaurant, and have been here a number of times.  Even when I returned that evening, Spencer, the bartender, called out to me to say \"HI!\" and said he had not seen me for a while.   True, I said, but that I would be back.  I would be remiss to not mention all of the wait staff are friendly and professional.",

When I saw they had the same deal for restaurant week this year, I decided to pay it forward and mentioned to another buddy who I know has never been to Fogo de Chao.    Once seated,our server mentioned RW and then said but you don't get the premium meats.  For only $10 more you can have rack of lamb, and filet mignon just to name a few.  The card on the table identified you as getting the special cuts.  When I mentioned that last time I came for RW it wasn't that way the server said \"cutbacks\".    So of course we pay the $10 and flipped our cards to green.  Turns out we got the same food as everyone else.  They didn't bring out any lamb or filet.  When we inquired they \"rushed\" out some lamb.  That took over 30 minutes.  Then we asked for filet.  More than 30 minutes passed until we asked again.   In no time, some barely cooked filet made it to our table.    I think if I would have just stuck with the regular RW deal I would have probably enjoyed it more but knowing I paid extra for the same meal was a bit of a rip off - even if 2 lamb chops and a small piece of filet finally made it to my table.",

My bf made a dinner reservation for our anniversary at 7:30 pm Friday evening January 4th. I was so excited because we love fogo de chao. We go here every year for our anniversary.   Well last night didn't go so well. We were seated in a small table by the wall. I asked if we can have a better table since it was small and cluttered around other people. There was no room for us to move around and enjoy dinner if we stayed there. So we were seated at another spot but this time it was around 2 big party groups. I gave up and just said okay that's fine whatever.  We sat down and I ordered a glass of wine. Ate and waited for people to give me different type of steaks, meats, etc. Server checked on us about four times only the whole time we were there. I asked for the fried bananas like three times and they never came through until our original server who gave me wine finally gave me some.   To end the night we waited 15 minutes for them to come to our table and ask for the check since we were done eating. I was angry and annoyed. I told my bf this is the worst anniversary dinner ever. Service is just horrible. I couldn't enjoy my dinner or evening because of it.  Finally a different server asked if we were celebrating tonight for a special occasion. I said yes its our anniversary . He said he would bring a cake out on them. I thought it would be cake like we had previous years which was the cheesecake that said happy anniversary and it always looks presentable. Well this year he gave us a cake that looked like the last piece that no one wanted. It was tres leches and ugh! I did not enjoy that.    If I knew the service would be bad last night, I would not have bothered coming back here. I don't know what happened but, usually they have great service every year we come by. Time to move on and look for another place to celebrate my anniversary. I hate crappy service!",

Their salad bar experience is a wonderland of everything from plain roasted vegetables, smoked salmon with huge caper-berries, prosciutto straight off the bone, kale salads, cheese board, meat selection and fruit.  The market bar alone is just worth coming for.

I have to say, this one was better than the others I've been to. the meat, in many instances, was far more tender than I am used to having. The linguica was much less greasy than I've had elsewhere as well. They also knew how to cook a chicken breast and didn't dry it out like all the rest. They also take requests if you want something you haven't seen come by recently.  Their salad bar was also quite good.   They also make a very good caipirinha. If you happen to go and want to try it, just mention it as the Brazilian drink with the name you can't pronounce. They'll know.   The service was also ridiculously efficient and nice. The only drawback is we kept sending the fried banana away and noticing this, someone else would bring over more banana. The mashed potato side was a nice idea, but the mash was really runny.   The only real drawback is the price is really steep. At least it won't feel like a waste, however.",

With about 12 different meat options and a salad bar you better come hungry and take your time enjoying all the options before you fall quickly into a food trance. Sure its a bit pricey at $50 per person, but considering the quality of the meat is top notch and the huge all you can eat selection it's well worth it every once in a while! They have everything from filet mignon, to top and bottom sirloin, and my favorite, the lamb chops. Finger licking good! The salad bar is rather small compared to others I'm accustomed to, but the chicken and apple salad is memorable, as is the asparagus (which are BIG). Your meal is accompanied by mashed potatoes, plantains and polenta. These aren't anything to brag about, but who comes here to load up on carbs when you have all the meat to chose from. They also have a big wine room with a great selection.  I love that this is a Brazilian churrascaria that aims to look and serve authentic. The servers actually dress in authentic gaucho attire and most actually speak Portuguese! Last churrascaria I went to had caucasian servers who didn't speak a word of Portuguese or Spanish. Big points to Fogo de Chao! Like Sarah M. mentioned, the servers are always accessible but not overbearing. They give you a small discs at the start of the meal - green lets servers know to bring on the meat and red lets them know to move onto the next table. So you can always enjoy your meal at your own pace without feeling overwhelmed.  I love it!",

The gaucho outfits gave me a chuckle but to each their own the beef is good the lamb was superb and there is a salad bar ( that is also all you can handle at lunch) which was well stocked and included three different types of cheese.   No draft beer, but I did try the Brazilian black beer and it was tasty. Enjoy.   If you are a carnivore or omnivore and you like yourself... Eat here once before you shrug off this mortal coil... Or however Shakespeare said that.  ( always was better at math than English)",

They have a fresh and tasty buffet style salad bar with items such as, pasta salads, asparagus, fresh bread, fruit, and all sorts of side items. The variety of meat is phenomenal with chicken, filet mignons, rib eyes, etc. Wow! Is this place good. I highly recommend for small groups,  big parties, whoever!",

My complaint was with the manager's nonchalant attitude about it...as if everyone does that...no big deal.  I would give the restaurant another two stars but had to knock them down for the mgr's demeanor.",

The atmosphere is for all types of people, either you are on a date or out for a family outing. I know the price is a little high but its all worth it because your table is never empty and your drinks are always full. The meat is cooked to perfection, the cheese breads are freshly baked, the sides are just as delightful. Now the desert is mouth watering  delicious, I had the creme bruelle and new york cheesecake with my husband. I would definitely go back and send others there. Enjoy I know I did.",

YEAH, pretty great. everything receives a thumbs up, with the minor exception of birthday cake surprise dessert, which was...forgettable.   anyway... iron deficiency? no more! i was quite the satiated and proud meat-eater, despite that afterwards the animals took the rest of the week to become completely digested and absorbed.",

I had to keep reminding myself not to indulge too much on all the salad bar offerings so that I could try as many meat selections as I could handle.  Once the green light was given, the meat started coming.  All the meat offerings that I tried were excellent except for one, which is the only reason Fogo didn't get five stars from me.  The chicken breast was very dry, although I am sure that this was the exception and not the rule.  The rest of the meal was delicious which more than made up for the chicken breast.  The sides were also excellent and didn't stop coming either.  The service was friendly and attentive but not overwhelming.  We were never left wanting for anything.  And price?  More than fair.  For two dinners, three mixed drinks, a desert and a Bailys coffee it was about $175 with 18% gratuity.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "This was my first trip to Fogo de Chao, and it met my expectations. I was a little nervous because the main idea behind the restaurant is basically \"all the meat you can eat\", and I don't typically eat very much meat. I also knew going in that it would be pretty spendy, and Fogo met that expectation as well. Don't expect a menu; you won't get one. Instead, you get a \"guide\" to the meat that will be delivered to your table via gaucho-wearing servers in blue embroidered button-downs (interesting combo, but hey- how else will you combine the traditional Brazilian concept with Scottsdale professionalism?). And the meat just keeps coming! Flip your coaster from red to green to signal the gauchos that you need meat. Need a break to breathe, stretch, unbutton? No problem! Flip the ol' coaster back to red and they leave you alone for a bit. The salad bar is a nice addition to a seriously protein-heavy (non?) menu. That definitely helped me, since I don't eat red meat on a regular basis; I was able to pace myself a little better by starting with the salad (fyi: mix the ranch dressing with the basil sauce. Amazing.). The restaurant space is HUGE and loud. It's very difficult to have a conversation, and when you have your green coaster showing, the gauchos are constantly visiting your table. We made a reservation because Fogo was crazy busy with spring training crowds in town. We arrived early, sat in the bar for almost an hour, and when I checked with the hostess, apparently they 'tried' to buzz us on the little flashy-thingy, but it didn't work, so they gave our table away! We did get seated almost immediately following that, and our drinks were comped, so it was taken care of very well. I'll be going back here, but probably in a year or so; it's really expensive and it's a TON of meat, but it was amazing food. Selections to try: the bacon-wrapped filet mignon was so moist and flavorful! Make sure you get some of the cheeses and prosciutto from the salad bar, and definitely mix the ranch and basil dressings- to die for!",

    "text": "We eat here pretty often and really enjoy it. Great for diners that are gluten free. Service & food is five star; see my \"gluten free options\" section for reason for the three star review.   For lunch you can do the market table (extensive salad bar w/ different meats, cheeses, fruits, veggies, etc.) for $15; you can add 8-10oz of various cuts of meat for $8-9 or so the whole experience for $32. So lots of options and great for everyone.   Service: Service is always great... one time a server did a mini wine tasting with three different Malbec wines for us to try before deciding on a glass. If you want a certain type of meat, don't be afraid to ask for it.   Food: The \"market table\" salad bar has a little bit of everything for everyone... lots of meats, cheeses, fruits, veggies of all sorts. The sides that come with the meats are excellent (my favorite is the Pao de quiejo --- naturally gluten free cheesy bread made with yuca flour!!) And, of course, there are the meats -- not much to say except they're all delicious. Rare lamb chops are my FAVORITE. If you're not big on really salty foods, I would suggest letting someone else take a piece of meat before you do so you don't get the brine... I never can eat an \"outside piece\" because it's much too salty for my taste but most people love that part the most.   Drinks: Good wine selection. Can't speak for anything else.   Gluten free options: all meats, all salad bar items that are actually on the salad bar EXCEPT SALAD DRESSING... not sure about the items that are on the second small table. I do just want to comment that although most servers are knowledgeable about the gluten free options, my server today was new and not sure so asked someone else and came back to tell us that \"everything except the bread is gluten free\"... I just wanted to double check and nope, the dressings are NOT... I remember reading something about it online so I looked and then asked another server just to see if something had changed since the post online and she came back and said that the dressings are not GF. This is the only reason that I am giving three stars because I eat GF due to a wheat allergy, not Celiac, so I could have had a minor reaction, however for somebody with Celiacs, this could have caused them to become severely ill. I understand that some places may not educate servers on the exact ingredients of things but if your menu says to ask about gluten free options, the servers should be well informed!! Before today, this would have been a five star review.",

The salad bar is still good, however too many times they either did not have or ran out of smoked salmon. My last visit was on Christmas day. The web site said regular dinner prices, however, once at the restaurant they were charging more. The disappointment comes with the meat. Most selections were tough and dry. They did not have the baby lamb chops as usual and the overall quality of the meats has gone down. The service has also gone down. I never had to ask for the sides that automatically come with the meal. I've had to ask the last few times and they did not refill either the bread or bananas. I ended the meal with coffee and my coffee was not refilled. I had to wait and ask for a refill. I don't mind spending over a hundred dollars for a meal if it's good, but Fogo no longer fits that bill.",

At 39.50, sure there is some value here.  1. They purposely do not bring the filet out to the end - why bring expensive meat when they can fill you up on sirloin or beans/rice? why do you think they serve you beans and rice? 2. The salad bar is awesome - but again the sole purpose is to fill you up so you skip the meat  this is nothing more than a eyeball experience, (yes, you have never seen this before) and  you cannot believe the number of possible meats (and by the way, if you know beef, you will clearly recognize the cuts and the order they bring them to your table).  Go order a nice M/R filet somewhere with a  glass of wine and enjoy. Easy to skip FDC unless you are in it for the eyeball experience. you will easy spend $100 per person for average food, compared  for an excellent meal somewhere else",

And, while Baby C is pretty well behaved, he is now known to start testing his vocal cords out - chattering very loudly and screaming with excitement.  I was reassured when I made my reservations, that they did in fact have highchairs (30 in fact), not to worry about any mess Baby C would make, that there would be plenty of kids there, and it would be pretty loud.    Mother's Day and Father's Day - who leaves their kids with a babysitter anyway?!  I tell you what, I am glad I made a reservation for us and indicated we would need a high chair, because there was apparently a wait - On High Chairs!!    Our service was kinda so-so, but I attribute that to the fact that there were a TON of families there (we had a 2:30 reservation).  So many people in fact that I believe they ran out of meat, as we were waiting for quite a bit for a gaucho to come by wielding his sword of meat.   My favorite - The Lamb..hands down.

Today happens to be a lunch at Fogo day and as with other lunch times I've had here the service/food sucks. I swear it's annoying because they try to \"hide\" the tastiest (and prob most expensive) cuts like the beef ribs and the filet mignon. Like today, I asked for the beef ribs and not only did it take them 30 minutes to bring them, but they tasted like they were reheated hastily. The server didn't seem like he wanted to give me any of the good stuff, just the burnt inedible parts. Fail. I know my stuff here and asked another server to bring them back and he gave me better stuff, but that's beyond the point which is if you don't want people to get certain cuts, then just don't offer them! Part of the filet they gave me was burnt and inedible, the other part was good, but not the best. The atmosphere during lunch feels much different than during dinner, perhaps it's because dinner is busier, or perhaps because they've got fresh cuts at night and during lunch you get the left over crap. In any case, I'm going to stop referring this place altogether if they don't get their shit straight. Excuse my French but this gets annoying when you hype up the place to friends, then you take them and the experience sucks.",

We had 3 adults, 1 kid and 3 drinks which is about a $218.00 dollars charge (total bill's around $180 plus tip). On August 9, 2016, I checked my bank statement and my credit card got charges $418.00 dollars. They overcharged me $200.00 dollars.  I called the manager attention to the overcharge and instead of apologizing, he told me how it had never happened that before. Then, it was said that the tip mistake.     Is it really a mistake?",

But when your servers aren't happy to be there, or warm with the customers, I have to mark you down.   If you've never been to a brazillian steakhouse (churrascaria), they cook various meats Portugese BBQ style, and serve them to you tableside on huge skewers, with big knives! You use little tongs to grab the meat as they cut it, and away they go to the next table. You use an object, sometimes a wooden dowell, or here you use a table coaster to turn it to the green side when you'd like them to keep serving you meat, turn it to red when you want to take a break.   I enjoyed the sirloin, the lamb, the chicken legs, and the sausage. The salad bar is amazing, and the sides they bring you include cheese bread, friend plantains,whipped potatoes, and these little polenta sticks dusted with parmesean. I had a beer with dinner, and the molten lava cake for dessert.  About $75.00 for everything, and it was just me.",

The hostesses were clueless as to the previously arranged plan for the group to be seated by a certain time.  Even after explaining the situation to them; they could'n't make it happen.  Ultimately, the guest of honor walked in while the group was milling around in the bar area.  Sat at a table in the bar as we were waiting.  no wait person ever acknowledged us.  Went to the bar and ordered a beer and mixed drink.  The bar tender put the drinks down w/out cocktail napkins or  inquiring about   rather I would like the beer in a glass or wanted water, etc. At $16.00 per cocktail; they need to do better.  The salad bar was fresh and with several unique options.   Ultimately, once seated the food came.  the grilled meats were very good; but it was all delivered so fast (6 + different meats in 10 mins) it was a little hard to appreciate and savor any one meat. If all you can eat meat at significant expense is what you're looking for; this place will do. For me; overpriced food for the service.  I doubt I'll be back.",

I'm super picky about the meat I consume (mostly that it does not qualify as \"weird\") and am not very flesh-venturous.    The restaurant is beautifully appointed.  While we did not sit at the bar, it looks like a great place to enjoy a happy hour.  The dining area is large and open.  As we weaved our way around the tables to the \"salad\" bar, it had the feel of a large wedding venue.  The salad bar was extremely varied and nice deviation from the near constant processional of meat.  There was a small salad section but many other choices - fresh mozzarella, potato salad, olives and a number of other goodies.  The yucca bread and polenta fries were fabulous.      The drinks were tasty (they make a mean caipirinha) albeit overpriced (which is to say, Scottsdale-priced).    Desserts ranged from tasty to average.  The flan and tres leches cake were well received.  The cheesecake was tasty but could have come from Costco.    I noticed they had a location in Sao Paulo, Brazil so I mentioned to a friend that we had gone there.  He had been to the Brazil location and said it was the best churrascaria he'd ever had.    So, Fogo is definitely the real deal in terms of Brazilian steakhouses.  My gentle constitution protested the next day from about 3 weeks worth of meat consumption in a few mere hours, but as I said, I'm barely a carnivore.",

Granted, there was a 30-person private party in the back room, but there were also 40+ of us in the main dining room and we were absolutely starving.  Normally we are in and out in 1 hour.  This visit took 2.5 hours because the staff simply did not bring us food.   The food we did receive was either undercooked, or burnt to a crisp.  This was our first attendance at the new Saturday morning brunch, and it will definitely be our last!   To be honest, the quality and service has declined so much that we may never return to this location again!  PS:  when we returned home we became gravely ill and spent the next two days in misery.  Take that for what it is worth....",

    "text": "Fogo de BLAH!  What the heck happened to this place? Admittedly, I have never been a huge fan of this Fogo de Chao.  Since I am not a huge meat eater....I am the person this type of restaurant makes their money from.  However....in the past, at least the food and service were good.  Not so much tonight.  :-(  Our waiter was friendly enough ...but we had to ask repeatedly for menus, drink menus, side dishes (rice and beans), table service, etc.  When we inquired re: the possibility of taking home some scraps for our dog - the waiter sent the manager for a lengthy and unnecessary explanation about the potential abuse.  A simple \"no\" would have been adequate.  I get the concern - but, hey...how about this as a solution....let the waiter put your scraps in a bag for Fido.  No concern about heaping piles of meat being taken home, and less waste.  When we were leaving...we looked around for the super yummy mints in the lobby area. Hm...our favorite part of the night....not to be found??  We asked the gal at the front, who grudgingly (GRUDGINGLY!!) pulled out a plastic tray and gave us a couple mints.  When another member of our party asked for a mint or two, she said \"oh, I thought you were with them.\"   WFT? For the cost of a couple of mints, this restaurant will mint-shame a party of four?  Wow, perhaps a course in customer service might be helpful.  Are a couple of mints really worth alienating a group that just dropped $400 for a few slices of meat?  Rumor has it Fugo de Chao may he having some financial difficulties.  Granted, the restaurant options in Scottsdale are galore.  SUGGESTION - poor customer survice is NOT the way to solve this problem.  I'm just glad I now have a legitimate reason to never give my money to this restaurant again.  For the same price, I can and eat a delicious steak at Mastro's, AND be treated as a valued customer.   After tonight, FDC has successfully alienated the members of my group who have championed this restaurant in the past.   Good riddance Fogo, you won't be missed.",

    "text": "Been here in Houston, DC, and now Scottsdale. Good. Every. Time.  First, the pao de queijo is so good. Warm, soft, fluffy, slightly cheesy but not to heavy, I could eat them all night if I didn't have a lot of meat to devour later.  The sides, the bananas, fried polenta, mashed potatoes. I only ate the fried polenta, which is crispy deliciousness and not too salty, but my friends had the bananas and potatoes and liked those a lot.  Meat. Well, there's a lot. If it's your first time, I suggest you try A LITTLE BIT of everything to find out what you like, then just get those items. Considering it's more than 50$ a person, It's pretty much what you have to do to make it worthwhile. Since I've already done that, my go-tos are the lamb chops, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped filet mignon (probably only get 1-2, bacon, while delicious, tends to get heavy), and filet mignon. My husband really likes bottom sirloin too, which I'll also get if I'm in the mood.  The salad bar is also super awesome!! Which I would suggest eating at the end of your meal to make the most of your stomach space for the meat. There's this heart of something (forgot what it was) that looks kinda like a bamboo shoot (same color, shape) but it's not hollow. It's got a light sour taste to it (like artichoke hearts) and the outside texture is kinda like artichoke hearts, but the middle is almost creamy. If you like that flavor and texture, def try it. I have no idea what it is but I like it! Other than that, fruit's pretty good, they had prepared orange and grapefruit slices which is a huge plus if you've ever eating a grapefruit.  They also have a salad bar only option if you have vegetarian friends/family. I think that's about 30$ or so? Still a bit selection.  Service is good too! The meat handlers may feel a bit pushy, but don't hesitate to say no if you don't want what they're offering. There are also floor managers making sure that if there's ever a lull in your meat service that they get you what you want.  If you haven't been and have money, goooooo!!!!!",

I've now been to 4 of the 19 US locations and I would say this one is right on par with the rest of them i've been to.  What do I love about Fogo de Chao?  The quality of meat is excellent compared to many of the other chains.  I consider Texas de Brazil the only competition when it comes to meat quality and flavor.  The service is always impeccable and you never have to wait long for gauchos to make their rounds.  I've also had multiple occasions where the gaucho serving the filet mignon gives generous portions, which quite frankly pays for the meal in itself!  The salad bar could be much improved in my opinion, but I hardly waste any time there so I won't waste my time complaining about it.  The scalloped potatoes are delicious, though...but carbs are AYCE killers!  Every table is served fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, and the famous cheese balls.  The cheese balls are doughnut hole sized pillows of cheesy doughy goodness, but again...carbs!    My dad and I love to save the bananas for our dessert.  Seriously though, give me one plate of those bananas, a scoop of Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream,  and a bed to nap in after I enter my food coma and that's what heaven must be like!  My favorite cuts: -Filet Mignon...duh -Picanha, the house specialty -Ribeye -Top sirloin -Leg of lamb",

I dont know about everyone else, but i will defiantly be back to eat here at Fogo De Chao.  FYI: The host and staff were great and friendly.  also keep in mind they charge per bottle for coke products, my friend found that out when he got his bill for drinking 4 cokes lol....   Note*  1st time eating here, try out the lunch hour because it is decently price for about $30 a person, dinner goes about $50 a person, but it is worth ever dime for unlimited choices of meats that came around our table during the entire time we were there..  :-)",

The entire experience I would describe as pleasantly indulgent. My brother was impressed and grateful.   At Fogo everyone is your waiter. If you haven't been there before be sure to let them know so they may explain how it works. While the entire staff was great we cannot say enough about the exceptional service Steven provided. He typically works at the bar but stepped out to assist and we were lucky enough to get him!   Thank you Fogo and Steven for making the dinner so special!   My only regret - not taking any food pics!

Our waiter was good, checked in often and kept up up to date on drinks. We were excited for the selections of meat to come around but they were few and far between here is y breakdown  though.  garlic beef, small pieces that were significantly overcooked and very tough. the lamb was delicious. Filet was bland and rather tough. Prime sirloin ( house special) was fantastic, great flavor and very tender although it was doled out in really thin slices. Flank steak, they called bottom sirloin was very inconsistent ranged from charred and flavorless to , just ok.  The Ribeye was again unimpressive and mostly flavorless. The biggest criticism i have is the waiting for food. Unlike other BSHs I've been to you had to wait and often times ask for someone to come around with the cuts and much to my surprise several of the servers had no idea what rare vs medium was. All in all,  not really worth the time or money in my opinion",

The gauchos werent very friendly, but I guess theyre not supposed to be personable.   I was disappointed in the salad bar, not much there, everything is cold.  When your card is green and you just sit down its a bit overwelming... then it dies off and youre looking around, asking for specific things, I never did see the filet minion again.  Mashed potatoes were so boring. Bananas were good, but nothing special. Out of all the meats my favorite was the parm crusted pork (usually dont care for pork and am a huge steak eater) the steaks just didnt have any flavor. Some were really salty. Some things were dried out.   Overall, fun idea, fun with friends, great if your husband can eat a lot, get your moneys worth. But for me, it wasnt worth that amount for that quality. Id pay $50 for an amazing 5oz filet over this any day.",

The service was excellent- the waiter gave us an option between restaurant week or normal selection and explained the difference and walked us through the whole process.   The salad bar has anything you could want- even trendy kale- but dont spend too much time there because you want to save it for the real stuff.   The meat kept rolling in every minute once we had our card flipped green- it was like heaven on earth.   The one complaint I have is that the filet was over cooked and slightly burnt- other than that it was a great time with friends   Id definitely recommend this place. 50 bucks gets you enough food for a week",

We had a huge party of people and they did a stellar job serving us. It's a place where it's all you can eat and you simply keep getting served until you flip over your card to red or pop from eating so much. The salad bar is one of the best ones I've seen. They had kale salad, pickled tomatoes, a couple good cheeses, and the whole assortment. A vegetarian will not have any issues with finding something to eat even if it is a Brazilian steakhouse.  They also have good desserts and beverages as well as a good dessert drink menu. If you're there to eat meat, only eat a small bit of salad or none at all. They serve a delicious bread before and during, as well a few sides that come out with the meat. Mashed potatoes, fried corn bread type things, and fried plantains. We had a great experience, the servers were attentive and took care of us well.",

Chicken, pork, riblets, and lamb were all dry as a bone. 3. The salad bar left a lot to be desired in my opinion. They had some good, unique choices and displays, but they should also offer traditional salad options.   We spent $50 each, had a reservation at 6pm and left at 645pm. That says something. You are much better off going to a real steakhouse like Mastro's City Hall or Ruth's Chris. At least their meats are worth the price.",

    "text": "Ok. It all started when the person I spoke with said that reservations are not needed up until 8 pm. I said okay. My wife and I are the only ones coming. Granted we have been here 10 plus times. We arrive at 630. The hostess says there's a 45 wait. I explain our previous conversation. With hesitation she agrees to seat us right away. So my wife and I are seated in the far back corner where no one can really see us and meet our dining needs. When it's time for the meats to go around we were not offered some of the meats that are on the menu. So we make a request to our server Gilbert, who by the way was okay., We continued to wait for upwards of 20 minutes to get the pincane cut. I mentioned it to three different waiters. Then after it was all said and done the cut that was brought out was dry. Remember we have been here ten plus times.  Then came the check. I had to ask to pay. Then the server took my card and disappeared for about 20 more minutes. I was close to coming up to the hostess booth to get my card.  Every new years eve we bring about 20 people with us. If you don't want my business or my money please say so. Tonight's meal wasn't worth the $114.00 I spent. The service was terrible ..food good..service not so much. Please contact me with a solution as soon as possible. Thank you.",

    "text": "I've been to Fogo De Chao probably 5 or 6 times now, and this experience was probably the worst.  You know what they say...you usually don't write good reviews all the time, but when you experience a bad one, you'll surely write one.  This is the case last night.  The times we do go, its usually on a Friday or Saturday night, but this time we went on a Thursday night.  The food was great as usual, but the service was god awful.  It was extremely slow.  So everyone knows their concept, you drop 60 bucks for all you can eat meat and their salad bar.  They have guy walking around with meats and they stop by your table, well on this night it seemed our table was completely invisible  to them.  So we arrived in a pretty big group, there were about 15 of us.  We arrived at 6:00 PM and started eating at 6:15.  From 6:15 to 6:45 only one \"guacho\" came to our table.  We addressed it with our waiter who was extremely friendly and helpful, but she really couldn't do much.  When she finally did tell them, they would come to our table and offer meat to couple of people, then walk away.  We were to the point where we were trying to flag people down!  The gaucho's with chicken and pork stopped by out table frequently, but I didn't pay 60.00 bucks for chicken, I wanted the red meat!  Overall, extremely disappointing experience for sure.  It got to the point where, I wasn't even full or satisfied, but just gave up on flagging those jokers down and flipped the card to red.  Matay.  I give up.  Maybe it was just a weekend, understaff or whatever, but it was truly a disappointing night and the service was pathetic.",

The negative: in a place where the star was supposed to be the meat it was mostly inedible. The garlic beef was mostly fat and gristle, chicken dry, bacon wrapped beef tough, never saw any lamb, ribs or filet.  I have NEVER complained about a restaurant while still there but today I could not contain my disappointment as this meal spoiled our special day.  Norma and Marco apologized profusely but it was too late to make up for the poor food served. We were not charged for the dinner and we were given a piece of cheese cake, but the damage was done. We will not return. It would be ridiculous to return and ruin another night out. I don't not get the great reviews!",

    "text": "First I have to say the food is still amazing. My rating is due to extremely bad service we received tonight. It all started great, but once we turned our round things to green it went downhill. First I had to flag down a waiter to ask for sides. Apparently none of them thought to bring sides for the people with steak on their plates.  Once they started bringing different meats around one thing became very apparent- it was all sirloin and pork. So we had some and it was good, but we were looking forward to having some ribeye and filet mignon, so we said no to about 15 offers of more sirloin. At that point a waiter asked us if we were looking for a particular cut, yes, we said. He told us he would send some our way and we never saw him again. No ribeye or filet mignon either. The situation repeated 2 more times, none of them came back to check on us. Trust me, I would have been perfectly happy if they at least told us it will be a few minutes or they are out of it. But nothing.... untill maybe 20-30 min later someone offered us the cuts.  I ate the plantains we had as one of the side dishes and were not offered any more ( they used to always refill them).  And the last straw was that the waitstaff was obvoisly avoiding eye contact and it took us a while to even get our check I have been to different locations of Fogo de Chao multiple times and always was extremely pleased with service as well as food. Me and my boyfriend were very excited about going to my favorite restaurant but left very disappointed. What happened? New ownership? Trying to save money and first offer cheaper cuts of meat? Why was the service so bad? Would love to hear from the restaurant representative please",

The lamb chops were OK, but they were overcooked as well. Not a hint of pink was to be seen. I was greatly disappointed and would recommend Ruth Chris and spend a few extra bucks. The only reason why I'm giving this place more than one star is because the service was better than average.",

Before you can finish one slice another is surely on it's way....  If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse expect it to be busy and I assure you, you will return. It's an experience good for any occasion.  I appreciate that I can come in my t-shirt and jeans and not feel out of place eating an upscale meal. You can dress up if you'd like but you don't HAVE to and I appreciate that!   It's great for parties, families and business... I loveeee this place...but be advised your gonna spend some $$ here. Don't worry it's worth every penny..come hungry..verrry hungry!!!!",

My favorite was the bottom sirloin and the second runner up was the rib eye.  Most of the meats were cooked to perfection and juicy while some were over cooked.  The chicken was definitely over cooked and dry.    They have a nice salad bar cause truthfully after a while you want some greens in your diet so much appreciated.  They had everything from kale to apple salads to freshen up your palate.    Overall, a nice sit down dining experience and afterwards I hope some of you are like me.  I felt like running it off! -Enjoy!",

Probably had 3 different types of beef, the rest were chicken breasts, legs, lamb, and sausages. We paid $50 a person for meat not fillers. Never saw filet mignon or the other better cuts of beef. Definitely left disappointed. Also took 3 tries to get the check right. Last year we got a GC to come back, this time nothing was offered.",

Every part of the restaurant staff seems dedicated to your enjoyment.  Now for the food. I would come here for the salad bar and side dishes alone. Fresh, crisp greens; garden vegetables beautifully presented, an ever changing selection of cheeses and deli meats, olives. I could go on! The garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas and polenta are delicious and served in the perfect amount.   What can I say about the meat? Cuts of beef familiar and novel, pork roast, lamb chops, pork and beef ribs all expertly cooked on swords around an open flame. Chicken and sausages roasted to perfection. I loved the top and bottom sirloin and the filet. I always have at least a piece of chicken and a sausage. I was too stuffed to try the lamb or beef ribs.  The dessert was just right. We had the flan, the creme brulee and the chocolate mousse cake.   Finally, the cocktails were perfect. I will always go to a Fogo de Chao when I can. If you've never been there, you owe to to yourself.",

The little rolls made of Yucca flour and cheese (I don't know what they are called) were incredibly tasty.  They are light yet somehow very satisfying.  There were too many cuts of meat to count, all of which were prepared very well in different temperatures so you can have your preference.  One of my favorites was the garlic beef.  Service and atmosphere were both excellent.  All the servers and \"meat-men\" were extremely friendly and well-polished.",

Beef filet made its was over one time, and we each were given a tiny sliver. The real disappointment was that since we were there celebrating my birthday, we indicated that on the reservation. My husband and my friend told 2 of the servers it was my birthday, and my 11 year old son went over and told the person at the host  stand also, and no one ever offered a birthday dessert until after the bill came and my friend made a stink about it. If you are coming here to celebrate something, don't. You can get a nicer meal and better service for a lot less. We were there for 2 hours, spent over $300 and were only offered half the items they tout on their website. Pretty disappointing. We won't be back.",

The restaurant is in a nice area and very easy to find. Its an upscale place so people were dressed up but I also saw people who were dressed very casual too. We were with a large party so we were seated in the back room the restaurant. It was obviously our first time here and nobody explained or came around to our table for a good 20 min. Finally we had to wave a waiter down to get our dinner started.  The dinner comes in two phases. First the salad bar and then the meat. They give you a two sided red/green coaster which you use to control to pace of how much meat you get. The salad bar is amazing and had a lot of variety. I recommend you take it easy your first round so you can have room for the meat. When your ready the meat carvers come around and cut the meat for you. I really enjoyed the lamb, filet mignon and the bacon wrapped chicken. I recommend you take your time eating the meat and not get everything all at once. The meat doesn't taste very good when it's cold so before trying a different meat finish the meat on your plate.  Overall the restaurant was nice, the food was good and we got free dessert because it was our friends birthday. My friends got to pick any dessert from the menu and the rest of our party got to pick either a cheesecake, chocolate moose and something else ( I can't remember lol).  They loose a star because it was our first time and nobody came around to our table to explain how everything works until we flagged someone down. It also took them a while for the meat to come around to our table.",

Fair warning- places like this are usually a flat $50 + alcohol, so if you are on a date plan to spend at least $150.   If you haven't experienced Brazilian steakhouse before, you are missing out on a terrific culinary experience.   The salad bar is terrific, and gives you an opportunity to load up with the greens, the fruits and the starches. It is a top notch salad bar.   Then when you sit down, you are treated to a cavalcade of delicious meats being served to you, one at a time, to accompany your meal. You can have as many as you want, and as much as you want. The quality of the cuts and their preparation is of the calibre you would expect at the nicest steakhouse- but this is all you can eat.   Truly a great place for celebration, I'll be returning!",

Considering the fact that I have spent more money on a single steak without sides at a traditional steakhouse, you definitely get bang for your buck with Fogo!   My only complaints are based on the service. There were numerous occasions where my date and I were ready for more meat (with our cards flipped up on the \"ready\" side) and the servers would come to the table next to us, with their backs turned to us and walk away when done.  They never bothered to check if our table or any others behind us were also wanting any. In addition, our main server definitely could have used some wine training as he was not able to tell us anything about the wines we asked about.  Despite some poor service situations, all in all, I was very impressed and will be back soon.",

They had white rice with freijoda (black bean stew with pork meats), this side dish was a perfect complement with the rich meats. One thing that I really appreciate is the service, the service here is top notch & classy. The servers are always helpful & willing to give suggestions.

    "text": "Lets start off good and work downward shall we.............. I loved the salad bar THE BEST APPLE AND CHICKEN SALAD I ever had.  Mozzarella Boccochinis, the best asparagus  I have had ever. Not crazy about the Prosciutto (no taste, very blah) but the smoked salmon superbly sliced and Fabulous. Let me not forget what ever was on the table in the pop over bread thing. OMG that was a highlight for me. Now I like to see my wait staff work hard as I tip off that idea. These Guys were on their game, quickly as if they were riding a horse. they came to the table with swords of meat and sliced accordingly to my desired cook level. After sampling every meat  (or most of them) I dawned on me that somehow they all tasted alike.   The saturation on herbs and the distinct flavor of lemon smothered each meat.   Now I like lemon of lamb and pork but not everything.  I did PIG out and I was sorry that I could not afford the 14.50 for a glass of wine nor the 8.50 for a cup of coffee.  I love meat and meat loves me, but I just can't be that glutenous.   Sorry I could not be more support of.",

It was very busy the night we went but we had reservations which I would suggest. We had great service from the team styled staff. The salad bar was good but I filled up on all the meat! I also loved the sides of mashed potatoes, fried bananas. My favorite meats were the Lombo (pork loin encrusted in parmesan) and the filet mignon.",

    "text": "Despite the high price of admission, Fogo is our favorite restaurant and we look for occasions or excuses to splurge. We first experienced Fogo in Philadelphia, but this location is even better, mostly from a service perspective (since their menus are the same). At this location, it is not hard to sample all the meat, even the more expensive tenderloin and ribeye.   You start your meal at the salad bar (which could be a meal in itself if you have vegetarian friends), which has great selections including fresh mozzarella, smoked salmon, prosciutto, and the best apple salad I've had anywhere. And then, onto the main course, an all-you-can-eat meat extravaganza. You control the pace of your meal by indicating when the servers should come by and carve your selection table-side off of large skewers. It's like getting dinner and a show as the gauchos dart through the dining room with sizzling hot selections. Our favorite is the house special, Picanha, and of course the bacon-wrapped filet mignon. While chowing down you are also given unlimited side dishes, including airy, irresistible cheese bread, crispy fried polenta, garlic mashed potatoes, and carmelized bananas. And, if you save room for dessert, their creme brulee is second to none. I wouldn't recommend their cakes though.",

It went perfectly with all of the meat we were eating. How we had room for dessert is beyond me but the hot molten cake and the tres leches, wow!

They also offer chicken and pork, ribs... etc. Their salad bar is decent but don't waste your time. It'll fill you quick, and in my experiences there, wait out for the meat. Its a nice place too, so dress up. It ruins the experience of the ambiance. Its a quick eat, we got in and out of there under an hour. I was very impressed. You can start eating as soon as you sit down. And another plus.... you can eat all you want! It's a bit pricey, at like $50 a person starting off, but well worth it, for the experience alone. Its a perfect fun date place too. They have a nice bar area, too.",

The service, however, was spotty. Took forever to come back for our wine order, then brought the wrong bottle and we had to ask 3 times for a beer we'd ordered at the same time. It does seem to be a spot for baseball players to hang out during spring training, so you might spot someone and our waiter was helpful in pointing out who was there last night. But, you have to eat a LOT of beef to get your $55 worth here, so not sure I'd go back.",

    "text": "I went here recently with a medium sized group for a bachelor party dinner.  We arrived right at 6 pm for our reservations and were seated immediately.  We were given the rundown on how everything works, and then were unleashed.    My first stop was the salad.  I came in with a plan, go easy on the salad part to leave room for the good stuff (meat) and get some salad fixin's to at least make it seem like it is a somewhat balanced meal.  Overall, I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the salad bar.  The only things that I were really impressed with was the fresh cheeses (fresh mozzarella balls especially).  I guess the pesto salad dressing was nice but most of it was just average for me.    Finished the salad plate, and flipped the red/green card to go.  (Note:  I'm not sure how efficient this system was, there were times when I was green and the gaucho's passed me by, and times where I was red when they asked how I liked my cut).   All of the sudden it was a whirlwind of skewer toting gaucho's, asking if you'd like some of their meat (hmm...that sounds more like a description for a bachelorette party?).  I tried countless different cuts of meats, top sirloin, filet, chicken leg, lamb, etc.  My least favorites were the lamb (did not like the flavor, I usually really like lamb) and garlic meat (can't remember the cut offhand) which was a little overpowering with the garlic (and I like garlic).  The best were the filet mignon and the rib eye.  The other meats I had were also very good.  We were also served some cheesy bread rolls and a trio of sides, garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried plaintains.  I did not try the plantains, but the garlic mashed were uninspired at best (and opposite of the meat had little to no garlic flavor) but the polenta was fantastic.  I had at least three of those suckers.    Service was mostly good.  One problem with the meat service is that you get hit with 5-7 different meats in rapid succession, then you don't see another server for a bit.  Kind of feast of famine...  Also, we had one person order an after dinner coffee that wasn't deliver and an error on the check.  I additionally thought that the layout of the restaurant wasn't great, when it was crowded when we left it was pretty hard making it through all the tables when they were full and you had tons of employees running around.  I liked it.  I would definitely go back to a brazilian style steakhouse again, though if I went to Fogo, I might go for lunch (starting Oct 1) and save about $20 bucks.",

The dinig room at night is like a dance floor of waiters holding there meatsticks and offering it up to our hungry mouths. Ok, that looks like a porn intro.... but it's True. So for now call me Brandon St. Randy cause I want the meat they got. First off skip the salad bar please. This is a place to get your protein, nothing else. The slad bar has all kinds of frou frou hearts of palm, and aged romano. Sissy shit. Here at Fogo it's meat only. The house specialty here is the \"picahna\" and it is so good. It's like the best part of bacon fat on top of juicy sirloin. Make sure you get good slices wth a good amount of fat cap. Skip the chicken legs.....boring. All other cuts of meat are delicious. Do not pass on the Brazilian Limeonade!!! DO NOT! It is bottomless and so damn tasty, just needs a good rum in it.   Inexpensive for what you get. Make sure to turn your service card to OFF or there will be a dancing meat stick waiter on one of your elbow's.  They offer excellent sides. Caramlized Bananas, Grilled Polenta and you can ask your waiter for spicy dipping sauce, it is not on the menu or offered you need to ask. The varietes of meat include Top and Bottom Sirloin, Tenderloin, Pork and Beef Ribs, Chicken Drums, Lamb Chops and Chicken wrapped in Bacon. For me, it's only the Red's....Meat that is!",

I remember being fuller than I've ever been and for whatever reason kept me away from there for a while. Overall the food was good, but not great.  The salad bar was pretty tasty and had some good selections. I didn't have one meat offering that I was blown away by.  The service was average and it didn't help that one of the meat carvers spilled meat juice on the back of my shirt (was never mentioned, but noticed by my wife). I made the hostess aware of this and they gave me a wipe to try and clean it.  You would have thought that they would have thrown in a free dessert or something on the house, but just a \"sorry about that\". They also offered to pay for the cleaning if it didn't come out.  If you haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, it's probably worth checking out, but to me seems a little gimmicky and probably will be a while before I'm back.",

I was a fan of most, although it seemed as though there was a little too much salt on all of the meats.  It was a wide array of choices.  My least favorite was the pork ribs which were very dry.  It would not be a suggestion of mine as a place to go on a date, it is $45 per person to eat and I feel to get the full value you have to eat a lot!!

I had a few drinks in the bar with colleagues. The bar was small but nice. Service was very good. We then went back to a private room with two huge wooden sliding doors. This room was rectangular and very classy. We were given the low down on how the place works. Go and hit the salad bar first, be conservative and then come back to your table for an all out meat on a sword fest.  The salad bar was good. Everything was super fresh and high quality. So was the unlimited meat. It was all tasty. Salty from the seasonings and cooking preparation, but delicious. The house special sirloin is not to be missed, along with the filet and the leg of lamb. The sausages are forgettable, the bacon wrapped filet is so so. 90% of what I ate was delicious and I could have as much of it as I wanted. The other 10% was fair and I could stop after one bite and move on without feeling like I made a mistake.",

My boyfriend and I have eaten in several Brazilian  steakhouses, including one excellent but more casual one in Guadalajara, and this one in Scottsdale shames the others. SHAMES THEM!  The service was spot on, the meats more flavorful than other Brazilian places we've been. Amazing wine list. And am I crazy or were all or most of the wait staff actually Brazilian??! The boyfriend has known several Brazilians and spotted the accent. How much more authentic can you get?  I adore the salad bar at these places, but holy moly i wasn't prepared for the cheese bread. When you read the words \"cheese bread\" you're mind might go immediately to Red Lobster type places. Or at least mine does. Yak. But these are little pillowy soft bread rolls with a cheesy consistency. Not heavy at all. How do they get the flour and cheese to play nice like that??  I have to disagree with people's comments about waiting longer for well-done cuts. I dont eat anything that isn't brown brown done. And they happily offered up the perfect cuts.  how can you no to bacon wrapped sirloin. Dear god!",

    "text": "Sadly, I must rate my recent experience at this location as one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant and considering how much I previously loved this place, it really is unfortunate.  Our group had a 2:00 PM reservation which we later found out that they close at 2:00 PM to set up for dinner service. Please note this was for our office celebration for a year of working our tails off NOT something that we do often -- We were so excited that we had a timer count down in the office until we headed out to a place that \"WE ALL LOVED\".    WE WERE RUSHED from start to finish!!! - it was so uncomfortable having the staff eye us as if we were going to rob the place.   Drink service took 30 mins - Literally! - ABSOLUTELY unacceptable for such a highly rated place!  We received the incorrect bottles of wine, were told they did not have a bartender - very confusing for paying guests.       The servers bombarded our table with meats -  We couldn't enjoy a single bite without the next offering and repeated offering was being offered again -- the object of the on/off is for the servers to take note - they truly just wanted us out of there.  Our team is in the industry and tried to rush as fast as we could to be nice, but it really was not enjoyable.    On this same note of service:  A piece of very rare meat was being cut where blood splatter all over the white linen and a piece of meat flew into my water -- the server saw it and simply moved on to the next guest at our table and let me sit with the meaty water -- needless to say, I was a little repulsed.    During our white elephant gift exchange, we were announcing annual awards for our sales team and the server came over to shout out drinks to figure out what check belonged to each person at the table (please note split checks stink, I get it, but this was for drinks only and there were several of the (14) guests - that were not drinking) It was so inappropriate that the server interrupted our announcements. AGAIN super rushed.    Honestly, the list goes on and on and to say the very least, I as a guest that frequents this location often was extremely disappointed.  This experience was so displeasing that I will not return.  Moral of the story do not book a reservation at 2:00 PM, save yourself the awful experience!",

    "text": "I must say that the entrance to this place reminds me of Church doors. It must be the way the doors are designed that gives off that vibe. The place is decent the staff are dressed well and it seemed fancy but at the same time it's not? I guess it only seems fancy  by how everything is laid out on the table and how much your meal will cost.   If you go during lunch the price is about $30 and dinner it's about $55 for the Churrasco Experience (unlimited meat/salad bar).   They have a salad bar where you can get as many items of fresh salads and other side dishes  as many times as you want but limited on the selections they offer.   At the table, there's circular cards given to you. Green if you're ready for the servers to bring you an assorted types of meat. Flip it to Red if you want the servers to stop. Servers will also serve you different sides like fries, mashed potatoes, wings etc.   You get a selection of Pork, Chicken, Beef, etc. but after a while they all start to taste the same. It's great that you're given a chance to try unlimited meat but you get sick after a while. Your palette of flavor is limited.   We tried the full experience for dinner, it wasn't too bad but I wouldn't say we'll be excited to come back. However, the staff are very friendly and informative. They definitely explain well as to how everything works. I don't think a specific server is assigned to your table because they all work as a team and you can flag anyone down if you needed anything. Any servers would gladly assist you as to what you need. I think that it's great that they're all working together to satisfy customers needs. Although sometime's it takes them a while to get back to you.   We had a decent experience I wouldn't say it was bad but in my honest opinion I wouldn't be too crazy to want to come back any time soon. For me, I think everything seems a bit over priced.   Feel free to at least try the place out though. You might or might not like it. I guess it just depends on your preference.",

    "text": "As a first timer here, I gotta say I was very satisfied with the food, the choices of meats and they were all so so delicious. I'd definitely go here again. It's a great atmosphere and area. I dined with my family and ordered almost every meat but the lamb. The skirt steak and the Parm crusted pork is really great too. the bread is amazing. One of the best bread I'd ever had. The chimichurri is amazing!!. I would've given this review 5 stars but near the end the service it began to slow down. We asked for our bill and it was a 20-30 minute wait just to get the bill! A neighboring table that came after us got their bill before us after we requested it for 10 minutes. Aside from that, I'd let it slide and I'll be back.",

    "text": "I thought that I was going to like Fogo de Chao a lot more then I did. The idea of the restaurant is obviously very cool and unique. Unlimited amounts of meat and a full salad bar. However, the majority of the steaks all tasted the same and I thought that the majority of the meats were either over seasoned or too salty. The sides that came with the meal were pretty good. We loved the fried bananas and the polenta fries. Mashed potatoes were just okay in my opinion. Salad bar was good. They had a good amount of options. The cheesy bread that is served with the meal was good when it was warm, but when it got cold it wasn't very appetizing. I honestly just think its a little overpriced. If I'm paying 53 bucks then I want to be eating some of the most flavorful meat I've ever had, and this wasn't the case. Service was great though. All of the staff was very friendly.",

They do have a small bar that serves some exclusive drinks, but most of my time the two times i've been here have spent devouring blue cut, and rare steak, slice after slice.   It's very salty, very addictive, and makes you want to just push through your said human bodily limits, arbitrarily demolishing everything they toss your way. I dont stop them from bringing out the tasty morsels, until I truly need a break from the carnivorous cravings.   I tried some salad,  some desserts which I'm pretty sure cost extra if I remember correctly. I felt pretty-kewl flipping my table medallion back to on after I was mentally prepared for yet another aggressive assault by the staff of the various select choices of lamb and beef.   Check the special of the day, sometimes they offer 2 for 1 wine bottles!  out of 5, go check it out for yourself if you're in the Scottsdale area.",

    "text": "For my 100th review, I decided to choose a place that I truly enjoyed, and will make sure to make it a yearly event. I will break this down by several different factors, and hope this review is helpful in deciding whether to go or not.  Decor: As you walk into FDC, it feels very upscale, with a nice bar on the left near the waiting area. The restaurant looks like you should be dressed up a little more than just casual, and technically you should, but some have gone in shorts and a tank top. There is a ton of seating, and the staff are all dressed for the Brazilian theme.  Food: OK THE FOOD IS AMAZING. I wish that could be all that is needed to state, but I will make sure to kinda explain what is really good. All the steak is perfectly seasoned, and is almost like butter melting in your mouth. The sausage is pretty good as well, and I sadly am not the biggest fan of the chicken here. I think it can be overcooked at times, but luckily you can ask the staff for a less cooked option. They also have an amazing cold food bar with fruit, salads, and other options.  Service: The servers are all amazing people. They ensure you have a wonderful time during your visit, and constantly ensure you get anything you need. You don't have to worry about waiting to flag down your server, they all work together, and the staff seems very happy.  Overall: I want to thank the staff at FDC, they have a lifelong customer as long as I can come down there. The food, service, and drinks will always have me coming back. If you want an amazing experience, with food to match, then please come enjoy yourself. Just please make sure you wear the appropriate attire for this place.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this place from my initial experience at a Fogo de Chao in Chicago so I recommended this place to my boyfriend. Suffice it to say that our experience at this particular location in Scottsdale was less than satisfactory.  There were a lot of little things that happened that all added up to a frustrating experience. First of all, we weren't sure who our waiter was from the get go. We had a male server who introduced himself at first, but then a female waiter who came by later. This made it confusing when we were trying (with little success) to track either waiter down when we needed something.  Secondly, we asked the female waitress for a bread refill (after several minutes of sitting there wondering when someone would walk by) which never arrived. So again, waiting another SEVERAL minutes, we finally waved down the male waiter and asked for bread and water, since we still had not been offered a water refill. The male waiter then decided to walk around filling every other table's glasses before arriving at our table with more water but, again, no bread. He finally brought the bread several minutes later. And mind you the female waiter never asked us or apologized for not bringing bread the first time.   On top of this , we also wanted more soup and there were no bowls available at the soup section. We went back twice to check and still no bowls. My boyfriend also alerted an employee about there being no bowls and we never saw anyone come around to put out more.   Then someone cleared our table without asking us, utensils, napkins and all. When I came back from the salad bar and found I had no utensils we once again had to track down the waitress to ask for more utensils.  Finally, when we got our checks we were charged two full Brazilian dinners even though I had only gotten the Market option. When we alerted the waiitress she said she would go change it but we never received one word of apology from her.  The food was altogether decent, but nothing spectacular and my boyfriend said it wasnt worth the price. I was hoping he'd be more impressed by the experience of it all but it was altogether a pretty frustrating experience. We would have been happier customers if we'd at the very least received an apology or a discount on our checks.  Not coming back here again.",

    "text": "On 03/04/2018, a Sunday, we took our son out to your Scottsdale restaurant for his birthday. I made a reservation (party of 3) for noon and marked the box advising the celebration was for a birthday.    My wife was using a leg cart, and we were seated in the middle of the dining room. She had to weave in and out of tables and had difficulty doing so. The hostes that sat us, waited at the table and watched her struggle between other guests. Rather, she should have thought about the placement of the customer and the difficulty she was having. She dined only from the market place, which was also a struggle to get to and from due to where we were seated. She returned to the market for quiche and a beef dish. To her surprise, ALL three hot dishes were EMPTY.   I stepped away from the table for a moment, my wife and son still there. When I returned, all of the plates and silverware were removed.  One server overheard me commenting to my son, and she asked what the problem was. She brought new plates and silverware back to us, so we could finish our meal.  Never a mention of the birthday. I mentioned it when we received the check, unfortunately spoiling the surprise. My son, detecting my dissatisfaction, declined the now, late offer of a free desert.   The check did not reflect the market place for my wife and we were charged for the Brazilian brunch.  I had the server correct this.  I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied and disappointed in the lack of attention by the employees. Other Fogo de Chao's I have dined in, ran like well oiled machines. The food was always prepared and ready for the customer, and they were attentive.  Scottsdale Fogo fell COMPLETELY flat.    I posted this on their customer site and have not yet (as of 03/14/18) received a response. Here again, this shows me, and hopefully YOU, that they are not concerned with a customers dissatisfaction. I do not recommend going to this restaurant. Truly a disappointment.",

Greeted to a group of very rude hostesses but the waiter that first attended to us was very nice and thought it would turn around the experience. After he brought out the sides we never saw him again, were only checked on when they were getting us to sign up for their rewards club and then I finally got a refill on my drink and fresh plates. For the price I felt let down as they were bringing around the cheap meat until we requested steak. After that we didn't see anyone for like twenty minutes so we finally got the check which did not include the promo gift card they were advertising we had to ask for the manager to get that. Can't say I will go back to use it though, for the money I felt it would have been a better experience to go to Fleming's or Ruth's Chris.",

We are both on a low carb diet and from our research, this looked like a perfect fit.   The restaurant was table cloth and most of the people were dressed for the occasion. We were seated in the side room in the corner. This had the advantage of being quiet and privet, but had the disadvantage of being super far from the fancy salad bar. We made one trip out to it. It was a low carb candy bowl of cheeses, meats, and veggies. I grabbed a little of everything.   At the table,  the servers brought the meats. You tell them your preferred doneness and they slice it off the main shank for you. I had some nice fatty cuts and some very tender rare cuts of steak. They also brought some other sides to eat but they were bread, so sadly we couldn't eat them.   Everything tasted so wonderful that we got caught up in the moment. Having server after server stop by. Before we knew it, we had a nice line up of meats. We quickly made it through all the tasty cuts.   One thing I regret is that we got full eating too quickly. We should have slowed down. It's a pricy bill, but nice quality at all you can eat. Basically a Vegas buffet. Also the tables were really close together which made it hard to walk through. I don't know if this was for the holiday or if that's the normal layout.  Great for special occasions.",

The feijoada was terrible! The chef must have just opened a couple of cans of black beans, added a few pieces of old, over cooked pork, heated it up, and called it a day. The beans were then to be served over a bed of bland, over cooked rice.   Our waiter never offered a menu to order from as an alternative to the salad bar. White tablecloths and extremely high menu prices does not make this a classy restaurant. Our bill for four was $260.! Will not recommend restaurant to anyone nor will we return.

    "text": "I often tell people that I'm a meat-atarian, in which case, you could basically call Fogo de Chao a magical paradise for me! This was my first visit here during AZ Restaurant Week (everything was the same on the menu - no prix fixe - it was just cheaper than it typically is by about $10).  I made it my personal mission to try all of the meats on the menu and I was so close! I just missed one.. the bacon wrapped filet. I'll admit that by the end of the meal, I felt defeated and could not muster enough energy to ask the waiter to send over a guy with the bacon wrapped filet. I am okay though. I am proud to say I tried every other meat including the pork, lamb and chicken, not just the beef steaks!  If you don't want to get meats, you can pay about $20-something for just the salad bar. At first before going there, I thought it would be a rip off to just pay for the salad bar, but once I saw it in person, I said, \"Now I get it!\" The salad bar is loaded! There was sliced deli meats, smoked salmon, chicken salads in addition to cheeses, vegetables, and of course salads themselves. If you are a True meat-atarian as one of my husband's friends is, he warned us to stay far away from the salad bar. He told us, \"That is just a distraction\" that fools you into getting full before the meat cuts are served. It's a pretty simple concept. Turn that coaster green and you're in meat heaven. The waiters start hovering around your table with so many choices of meats, and you just keep saying, \"Yes, I'll try that\" over and over again no matter what your stomach's limit is. When I went there with my in-laws, I specificially told them, \"Do not eat all day,\" because I wanted them to be prepared for the smorgasboard.  I liked the setting too. The huge room was classy yet the atmosphere felt casual. You didn't have to dress overly fancy to eat here. I felt you could still be comfortable and wear stretchy clothes if you wanted to.. You know, to fit all that food in to get your money's worth. I guess my only slight complaint was that even though I asked for alot of meats to be served medium rare - they came out as medium and medium well on alot of meats. The sirloin and lamb cuts I received were perfectly medium rare but my filet each time was on the medium well side. I didn't want to waste the meat I had though in hopes of another one after the waiter had already served me the one I had. Should I have said something? I really don't know.. I'll just be more assertive about looking for a cut that's more medium rare next time, because I'm definitely going back!",

The wait staff all work together, so there is always someone around to answer a question, get you a clean plate, recommend a good wine, etc. You don't have to wait on one person to get you the service you deserve.  The food starts with small, buttery popovers that melt in your mouth. One visit to the salad bar and you have so many options from salad to cheese, meats like prosciutto and smoked salmon, and vegetables. The presentation is incredible as the salad bar sits in the middle of the room and almost beckons you to get started.  Place your coin on green and it's GO time. They have various cuts of meat from top sirloin to ribeye to chicken to pork, lamb and sausage, and they don't have just one way to prepare it. Some of the filets come wrapped in bacon, some do not. The pork tenderloin is encrusted with Parmesan. In addition to the endless meat that is coming at your plate, they serve garlic mashed potatoes and fried polenta. There's so much going on but you have to pace yourself by turning the coin to red and make sure you get a taste of everything!   This past visit my boyfriend and I were celebrating the purchase of our new home and the sale of an old home. The wait staff found out about it & surprised us at the end of our meal with creme brulee (my favorite actually) with the words CONGRATULATIONS across the plate. It wasn't just a nice touch, it was people going above and beyond to make sure we had a great EXPERIENCE and we did.   Can't wait to go back!",

Loved the ribeye and bacon wrapped filet.   Salad bar was good as was the polenta and bananas (and garlic mashed potatoes) brought to our table.   Expensive lunch ($78 which was the lunch, a glass of wine and iced tea) but according to my husband, he'd like to return he enjoyed it so much.",

Could do without the buffet style, but its restaurant week, so I'll give them a break.  The main course was delicious. When that card is flipped to the green side, beware! They come at you quickly, offering you bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, garlic steak.. So much to choose from! The sausage was wonderful, as was the filet. Order on the rare side, because the steak tends to be over cooked.   The desert was wonderful, but I was so full that it was quite difficult to finish it! I had the Tres Leches cake, and it definitely blew away my expectations.  Just to note, they have a wonderful wine list, as well as very nice valet in front! Do visit!",

We got seated very promptly as there weren't many customers there for lunch. My fav was the leg of lamb med-well. Second fav was the filet. For sides we didn't have a choice. The waiter just came and dropped three bowls (all of them were cold!): mashed potatoes, polenta strips and sauteed bananas. One of the highlights for us was when they brought around the sauteed mozzarella. Perfect texture and char on it. I would highly recommend it.   The food was good for any restaurant that charges a premium for quality buffet style meals. The low stars are due to the poor quality of service. I felt like the servers were rushing us to finish the meal. I was not asked if I wanted another beer (the guy just kept filling my glass of water). I have had been to the one in Philadelphia and would rate it 5 stars. This one only gets 3 from me.",

    "text": "Best and ONLY Brazilian restaurant in Phoenix, AZ. This is the best of the best. I'm a Brazilian so I KNOW what I'm talking about.   If you like and understand Brazilian food. This is the place to try. If you never tried Brazilian food, this will be different and something you should explore. It's a buffet style restaurant. Not my favorite type of restaurant but for Brazilian food, it's perfect.  This place is great for large groups. Lot's of fun! It can be nice for a couple too but you just have more fun in a group.   Don't even waste time, money on another Brazilian steak house other this one.    The service is always great. We come here every other month and we enjoy it a lot. There are several little things that I could find fault on but nothing major. I just wish it was a bit cheaper so we could come more often. I think a $25 per person on weekdays and Saturdays would keep this place super busy.   Anyways, it's worth it.  I really wish they would have Saturday and Sunday lunch!!! The vegetables, the salads, the entire salad bar is very fresh, authentic and everything looks good. The salads are very tasty. They offer hot side dishes once you turn your card green. The deserts are very good too. However, I like to get my cannoli fix at Pomo Pizzeria across Fogo for desert.   The food really does look appetizing. The  beans could be better though, that's my only complain. Also, I wish they had refills on soda, since they are so expensive. My favorite drink is the lemonade, I love it! They offer refils for the lemonade! However, $5 is a bit too much for a lemonade, $3 would have been reasonably priced.  Kids under 9, I think don't pay. It's great for kids and very healthy food. My son has Celiac Disease and he can eat lots of items here. He loves the polenta and cheese bread. We have eaten here many times and my son never ever got sick or cross contaminated. Lots of dairy free options as well. A good place for allergy folks!   Love the meat! I'm hungry now....",

They weren't kidding--when you turn the coaster over to green it gets INTENSE. Everything that touched my plate was AMAZING, with my favorites being the filet wrapped in bacon, parmesan crusted pork, and bacon wrapped chicken.  In the future, I now know to come HUNGRY. I filled up quickly, especially on the little (but delicious) cheese popovers on the table that they JUST KEEP REFILLING. There is a HUGE salad bar (to maybe alleviate the guilt of eating so much meat), but I ended up fast forwarding thru that to get to the good stuff.  My boyfriend ordered me a caipirinha (Brazil's signature drink) with pineapple and strawberries mixed in. Sweet, but very good.   Overall, Fogo de Chao was different then any other restaurant I've been too and I will definitely be returning.",

There are many Brazilian restaurants, however, most will leave you feeling sick as the quality of their meat is garbage. Fogo de Chao, is not one of those places. I have been to some high end steak houses, and the filet at Fogo is very comparable to those, but you can have as much as you want and they have a great salad bar as well. Every cut of meat here is top notch and you can taste the difference. I have gone to some other high end Brazilian restaurants and none have ever come close to Fogo. The only thing I would stay away from is their garlic beef unless you realllllly love garlic because that's really all you can taste. All the other meats are fantastic.",

Sure, the Market (salad bar) is stupendous, but don't fill up too much on marinated asparagus, nova salmon, brussel sprout salad, salumi,   incredible cheeses.... but I digress. Save it for the MEAT. Yes, it is quite a feast and sometimes can seem overwhelming, but so worth the flavors. After my 3rd time there, I've got it down. I've ID'd all the meats I like most, so I only ask for those now. (Remember, NO doggy bags!) Oh, don't forget to try their creamy horseradish. I'm sure they make it in house - they'd have to, it's just too good to come from a jar.   The sides are just as good as the meat. Garlic potatoes so creamy they melt in your mouth. The fried polenta w/parmesan is crisp and tasty. Fried bananas (they called them that, but I know they used to serve plantains). And then there's the beans w/rice. There's some name for the beans w/meats, but whatever they call it, it's DELICIOUS.  The service is just wonderful. Everyone is attentive and friendly, and really make you feel like you're eating in \"their home.\"  The only thing I would change is to add a real lounge with comfortable couches, etc. and serve cigars and apres dinner drinks. After a full belly, I would have loved to sit back, sip a cognac and smoke a fine cigar!",

So they wanted you to fill up on the chicken and sirloin before they ever came out with lamb or fillets... which was disappointing - since we are a family of lamb lovers.   The little sausages & chicken legs were gamey. Other than that the seasoning & flavors were great and the char cooking was tasty.

We're talking fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano (a whole wheel), manchego cheese, prosciutto.. delicious and satisfying all this and more for only 19.50! Now if you want to have endless rounds with the Gaucho's you'll have to pony up $42.50 (including unlimited salad bar), a real bargain if you ask me, great quality. The meat just keeps coming and coming.. highlights were the leg of lamb, garlic beef and the sausage. They also bring a basket of bread (they forgot ours) as well as fried bananas, mashed potatoes and fried polenta.. be sure to skip that stuff and stick to the meats and salad bar.   Oh, avoid the pork ribs.. while the Mr liked his, mine tasted like they were in someones ass for a while.. pretty nast though I think was the bones.

    "text": "We went here to celebrate our anniversary, hoping for a nice experience.  Instead we were seated near two large tables where they seated families with multiple kids shortly after we arrived.  Seriously-- who brings children to a $50/plate Brazilian steakhouse?  We thought we should dress up a bit, but patrons were there in tank tops and flip-flops.  Not what we expected at all. We sucked it up and continued to attempt to enjoy our evening, until we found there was quite an extended period of time we were left sitting with empty plates, waiting for meat to come around.  It seemed the meat carvers were circling the outer tables, running out, then leaving before visiting our table.  My husband asked for some rare house special, and waited over ten minutes for this to finally arrive!    The other major problem we encountered, besides a gaggle of young girls screaming, dancing and singing while blocking the exit from the restroom, was that there are so many servers you have no idea who to ask to get box or a check!  Since we were celebrating our anniversary, they graciously agreed to give us a complimentary dessert.  One server brought the menu and told us to choose anything we wanted from the menu!  Not two minutes later, another server came and said we would each get our own dessert, but could choose from only three options as it was part of the summer special.  It was quite comical when two small pieces of caramel cheesecake arrived at the table, followed by one large piece on a plate bearing the words \"Happy Anniversary!\" in chocolate sauce. This prompted the need for a box, which we asked for.  Quite comically, a few minutes later a waiter appeared with a bag.  A bag?  I'm supposed to put cheesecake in a bag?  It took several minutes more for a box to arrive, after which we waited a good five minutes for anyone to ask if we wanted the check.    Clearly the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing here.  On the plus, the meat is delicious, when you do finally get some at your table.  The salad bar has lots of great options as well, though who goes to a Brazilian steakhouse to fill up on salad?  The staff did make a big effort to correct all that had gone wrong, and were eager to ensure we enjoyed the night overall.   If you're looking for a nice, romantic restaurant to celebrate a special occasion, skip this place.",

This is hands down the best restaurant we have ever been to. The servers are wonderful, the food is delightful, and the atmosphere is elegant and comfortable.

I grow up with breakfast buffet every times we went on our summer vacation. This made me LOVE buffet style; however, Fogo de Chao did not have the great buffet but it is enough to response my need.  Even though I came for lamp but their beef are the best. Different kinds of them fulfilled my craving for red meat. Also caramelized banana and desert (soft cake that soaked with condense milk) helped ease my sweet tooth.  Now I tried to think which occasion I should go back their again.",

Yes, it \"seems\" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.  So much awesome unlimited red meat.  Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!  It's killer but don't fill up!  And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha.

    "text": "Having had great and enjoyable experiences with Argentine, Chilean, Columbian and Brazilian-style steak houses, or as their better known as 'Parrilladas' or 'Churrasquerias' primarily on the east coast, we were somewhat saddened at Fogo de Chao Scottsdale despite its well established, branded background and fab reviews - I guess their national size may have a lot to do with it and/or it may have not been their best day!  If you're a meat lover as we are, you will definitely enjoy the incredible aromas which abound throughout the restaurant - beef, chicken, chorizo, pork, lamb... WOW!  Their assortment of meats at first glance is incredible, servers abound scurrying and maneuvering throughout every nook and cranny of the floor amongst patrons balancing their Brazilian Meat Skewers while cautiously slicing thin cuts of your preferred serving, while ensuring their baggy gaucho bombachas appear to almost fall from their wastes!  That was almost as far as both of our interests ended.  We were served all the expected accoutrements in their full Churrasco meat experience.  I must say, the caramelized bananas, Brazilian cheese bread, garlic mashed potatoes and many of the salad and side dishes were very good, yet the meats offered, to our amazement, left much to be desired of.  We found their meats, with the exception of the Lamb which was almost perfect as it could be and to a certain extent the ribeye, either overcooked or lacking flavor - especially the chicken which at each serving was dry and unsavory.  Plus, unless you speak up, your servings are going to be miniscule!  If you are looking for a crowded, cramped atmosphere and a 'not-so-authentic' Brazilian meat experience, this is for you - but if you are interested in just over-indulging into meats, then it's OK.  You may want to remember the prices do not match the value - at all!  We were expecting both a memorable and tasty experience, but were disheartened by getting neither!  Not the meat connoisseurs' nirvana one would wholeheartedly anticipate.",

This restaurant has a amazing salad bar,  delish bread,  and yummy meats.  Go hungry it is not a place for picky eaters or people who don't eat in general.   The drinks are good quality,  and the selections of wine are superb.   It is easy to drop 200+ for 2 people.  But it is all worth it.  NOTE to Fogo... DON'T lose Marco!!!!",

    "text": "My previous experience was fantastic at a Brazilian steakhouse called Texas de Brazil I went to on business travel in Tampa, Florida. With that experience in mind, I expected to have a similar experience and the leading Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chao; however, I was let down by the atmosphere, food, and salad bar.    Atmosphere: Tables are very close together, especially the salad bar area which is very cramped. The layout is very broken and I expected more for a $$$ restaurant. There just isn't much energy, and it felt like a quiet family sit-down restaurant.    Service: They move to fast and need to do a better job announcing the type of meat being carried around. Maybe it would be better to have tags/labels on the tops of the meat spits as they carry it around. Often, my card is on red waiting for a specific cut of meat; however, they move so fast you don't have an option to flip your card before the cut of meat you want is gone.    Food: Wasn't impressive. It is under-seasoned even when using basic seasoning. Regarding the selection, I have to compare it to Texas de Brazil who did a much better job circulating different cuts of meat - mixing up top shelf beef cuts. Fogo de Chao circulated flank steak and top sirloin about 3 to 1, arguably to fill you up on lesser cuts - I didn't even see Ribeye which is insane. The salad bar was also very unimpressive. My wife doesn't eat a lot of meat, and for $22 you can just order the salad bar which I expected to be much better.    For the price I would have much rather spent my money at Ruth Chris, Fleming's, Morton's, or Capital Grill and get a much better cut of meat.",

I've been to a Brazilian Steakhouse once before in NYC... at that time in my life I didn't really like meat... that experience turned me around. I knew generally the rules to follow: don't eat TOO much at the salad bar, order a caprihina, and sample a wide variety of meats.   1. The salad bar was awesome! Pretty much everything I got I liked. I filled one plate full (enough for a normal dinner for me) and resisted going back.    2. We ordered caprihina's - the best I've ever had! I was hesitant because I've never really liked them much before, but ordered it for the full \"experience\". It was strong but very good! We also had a glass of Malbec, excellent glass of wine.   3. I'm a picky, picky meat eater, so I didn't like everything I was served, but that's to be expected from me. My favorites were the house cut, the filet, and the top sirloin. YUM!  4. The service was phenomenal... I'm not quite sure how they managed to stay so on top of everything, but they do a great job. Sometimes it was almost a bit much, like when my boyfriend took a spoonful of mashed potatoes from the dish and they whooshed in to replace it. There was still half a dish left! I don't like to be wasteful with my food.   I think the best part of Fogo de Chao is the first visit. It's so fun to sample everything. I'll definitely go back, though it might be awhile since it's such an indulgence.",

We were sat in the far corner away from everyone- including the servers and the churrasco server. After a very brief introduction, we waited. And waited and waited. At this point we flag someone down and ask how to get the ball rolling so we can eat. We probably had 4 churrasco servers the entire time we were there make their way to our table. Two which were the same meat. One over cooked and one raw. All we got to eat was beef. No pork. No lamb. No chicken. Besides the ribeye, nothing was good. We were very disappointed in the selection that was \"served\" to us, the slow service and the quality of the food. We could have gone to a normal steakhouse and saved literally $100. Not to mention there were children wailing. Grown men wearing tank tops and ripped jeans. Not worth it. At all. I miss TDB",

It was good on the various side dishes and some of the salad bar offerings.  Rice: Almost a pilaf style rice with very heavy chicken stock/butter flavor.  Black Beans: Delicious! Very creamy and filled with some type of smoked pork. Probably ham hocks. Wish I had some more right now.  Grilled Onions/Jalapenos: Can't remember what this was called. I had no idea this one existed but our server asked if I wanted to try it after requesting the other off menu side dishes.  11 of us had a whopping bill of $860 YOUCH!

    "text": "I've been fortunate enough to eat at Fogo in four different locations around the country and with some regularity - Manhattan, Dallas, Austin, and the shining jewel in the Fogo crown, Scottsdale AZ.   The quality of the food, from the salad components to the exquisite prime Angus beef is pretty much unmatched anywhere.  Decor is always pleasant and the service impeccable.  But nowhere is this more True than in the Scottsdale branch.  From the moment I arrive to the moment I leave I free like a king.  That's something that really resonates with me.  The staff is exceptional at all levels from the top down.  Professionalism and courtesy have clearly been instilled in everyone.  Dinner always starts with a caipiranha and some pao de queijo, a sort of Brazilian cheesy (gluten-free) bread. Then you face an overload of choice at their fantastic salad bar.  There is a temptation to go to town here but regulars know to save their appetite for the meat.  And the flick of the wrist from red to green on a colored coaster-type card signals the gauchos to begin the onslaught of meat.  For a real carnivore like myself it's heaven on the hoof!  They have about a dozen different cuts of meat including some beef, pork, lamb, and chicken.  The house specialty  is Picanha, which is a beef top sirloin that's rubbed with sea salt and spit grilled.  It's a simple preparation that makes the flavor of the beef really stand out.  From there you get inundated with filet mignon, bottom sirloin, garlic rubbed beef, parmigiano pork, etc and it doesn't end until you eventually cry \"enough!\"  There are side dishes too including garlic mashed potatoes, polenta, and fried bananas.  The latter are a great offset to the salted meat.  When you've had enough meat get the papaya cream for dessert with some creme de cassis to top it off.  All this for one low set price, less than a single steak at some restaurants.   With the exception of two or three things the menus is celiac and soy free.  I get to eat all over the world on business and I've eaten at some phenominal world class restaurants including a 2-star Michelin restaurant.  There are great places out there but when I consider the food quality, variety, service, and price, I keep coming back to Fogo as being somewhat unmatched.  Clearly I can't say enough good things about this place but I'm being honest about my experiences.  Check it out if you're ever in the Phoenix area or anywhere else there's a branch.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  Now if they'd just bring back the beets on the salad bar.....",

    "text": "As primarily a pescatarian this was an adventure way off the normal path. I was intrigued with the concept of the Brazilian steakhouse and the 'gaucho' way of creating a meal, so off we went. Looking to take it the full experience of what it was about and leaving the consequences of creating a massive slug of meat in my system for later.  The dining experience does not offer a menu of choices, instead what you have is a fixed dining experience. First is the salad buffet which is really quite fabulous. Everything I had was very fresh and quite tasty. Hearts of palm, artichoke bottoms, massive asparagus that is surprisingly crisp yet completely free of stringiness, and much more. It may have only been the starter yet it could have easily been the meal in itself -- not because of it being a bottomless buffet but rather because I found the quality and range of taste that good.  When you finish your salad a waiter quickly comes by to swap out your dirty plate for a clean one and then it is up to you to turn your service chip from red to green. Upon doing so what could be described as a swarm of waiters with various cuts of meat start stopping at your table to allow you to select different wellness pieces of their offerings. Everything is carried about on swords where either the pieces of meat are deskewered (in the case of something like the sausages or pork chops) or sliced into your personal tongs.  The problem I have here is separating all of the styles that came so fast to understand what I liked the best. There were a few that did indeed stand out but if you are coming for a visit there is no reason not to try all that is offered to find your on personal favorites. And there is also not a problem turning something away if you want to skip it (like I did with the chicken offerings that came around) or requesting something that did not seem to be making it to your table on its own (like what happened to us with the pork ribs). There are also sides of warm cheese bread, polenta, garlic mashed potatoes (that are incredibly light), and caramelized bananas on the table that they do a great job of keeping refreshed -- though I had a hard time even remembering they were there as I focused in on tasting the meat!  Of course I ended up eating way too much and for a someone who does not eat meat, but maybe once or twice a year, I would say I really enjoyed the experience. I was glad someone else ordered the molten chocolate cake dessert at the table so I could have a taste to top the night off!",

We also had to wait sometimes as long as ten minutes for items we requested like beef and pork ribs, rib eye steak, and lamb chops. The pork ribs were over cooked and when I told the server he said that this is how they are prepared in Brazil. I told him not True since I have been to Brazil two times and had very juicy, tender ribs.  I have been to this restaurant a few times, and this is the first time I feel like I was ripped off.  I will go back with the hope that it will be up to par. Maybe today was a bad day for them.",

Salad and side bar is amazing. The gauchos are friendly and never made us wait for the meat to be brought around.   We had a large party, and the whole restaurant was very accommodating. My older son is picky and didn't eat any meat, and ate minimally from the salad bar, so our server didn't even charge us for his meal, even though he is 14.   Will definitely return the next time we travel to AZ.  Oh, and an added bonus are the soft towels in the restroom. I know, it sounds weird, but when you're paying $50 per meal, the restrooms had better not have \"paper\" towels.",

I was stuffed and did not eat that much, but we tried a roll, bit of plantain, and a bit of polenta. It fills you up to eat salad and starchy stuff.

The service and atmosphere is what earned both stars. The only complaint in this department was when I went to the rest room, a service tray was leaning against the wall less than a foot from the urinal. Pretty gross for a crappy diner let alone a nice evening out.  The food was not worth the cost at all. All meats, except the sirloin, were way over cooked. The carver would ask how you would like the meat cooked, and we quickly learned your response did not matter. Dry and well done was what you got. My wife is pregnant so only soda for her, and one glass of wine for me. $148 total including a 20%tip. Not worth it at all. I will not return, and recommend looking elsewhere for a good Brazilian steakhouse.",

I also enjoyed the crispy hot polenta and caramelized banana side dishes. Yum!  Rolando was the waiter I had the most contact with and he was remarkable.  Evan, the GM, was friendly as well... this was such a treat to be a part of, and of course, even more fun because I was surrounded by some of my favorite yelpers!

We went as a party and the food was delicious. It is all it's cut out to be. Lamb, ribeye, chicken, pork, all of it. Just delicious. I've been to several steak houses and this is a very unique steak house that you will surely remember. It is a very cool change of things with the green card (feed me) and the red card (Stop feeding me). The one knock was the seafood tower. For the price have had much better sea food towers. The overall experience and quality of food is too good for them to get anything under a 5 star!!!! The salad bar is really cool with some unique cheeses, fresh salads, and some cool sides. If you want to change it up and enjoy yourself go here!!!!",

Couldn't even get the drinks correct, and we only ordered SODA!!!!!    Nobody knew what they were doing, it was SO chaotic and disorganized  it was almost like the employees never worked in the restaurant industry before.  I will NEVER EVER go, or recommend this restaurant to anyone, The price was most definately not worth the lack of service, we would have been better off going to McDonald's.  WORST experience ever!!!!!",

LOL This restaurant has the most elaborate salad bar in Arizona! They really do a great job of providing dishes with top quality ingredients. There are perhaps 30 different salad/cold side-dish options. This is just a bonus to the main meal. Beyond The coveted salad bar, the concept of exotic meats freshly made and carved straight to your plate... Just genius. Although spendy, the price is definitely fair for the product and service which is provided.",

We started out our meal with all you can eat salad bar, followed by unlimited choices of meats that came around our table during the entire dinner. We all finished up our meal with delicious dessert that we all shared. All of our guests left this place extremely satisfied and happy at the end of the night. Since majority of our guests did not go to the salad bar, they even removed some costs (we did not ask for it by the way) and did not add the 20% gratuity on our final bill. Due to the excellent customer service and how happy we were with this place, we ended up tipping them 30% instead.   If you have a huge get together and most of your guests are meat lovers, I highly recommend this place. They do require your credit card number and fill out two pages form for a large party reservation. However, they will not charge you unless there is a no show. Adults are approximately $55 per person and children are half price.",

I get it - you're offering unlimited prime meats - but that doesn't mean you should charge $16 for a 10 ounce cocktail.  Was it good? Yeah... but for that price it should be twice the freaking size.  C'mon.  The salad bar is spectacular... offering an array of Brazilian appetizers.  They bring fried bananas and pao de quiejo to the table as often as you'd like (tiny rolls baked with cheese in 'em that are just incredible.  The lunch offering, while not as plentiful as the dinner (in regards to the variety of meats they bring around) is half the price ($30'ish vs. $60'ish) and the only way to go in my opinion.  My favorite (even when I lived in Brazil) is the picanha - perfectly seasoned and medium rare, the way meat should be eaten.  Yesterday the pork and chicken wrapped in bacon weren't as tender or juicy as they've been in the past, but all the beef offerings were out of this world good.   The rice / bans / farofa remind me of the time I spent in Brazil and you must get a can of guarana for nostaligia's sake (their most popular soda - kind of tastes like cherry ginger ale).  The service is always solid and a few of the meat servers were actually from Brazil so I also got to practice my Portuguese too.  I'll be back, but only on rare occasions to celebrate something... word on the street is Rodizio is opening somewhere in the east valley and with their cheaper prices they'll certainly compete in this underrated foodie arena.",

Don't touch the salad bar until you try all the meats because there are about 8 different types and they're all scrumptious. The cooked bananas are also really good along with the mashed potatoes and polenta sides to clean your palate between meats. Also request a side of the chimichurri sauce, it goes great with every steak! Overall, I'd say the filet minion and lamb were my personal favorites. The service was also very good, the second you flip your card over they are there at your table with different meats. Definitely a unique experience that I would do over and over.",

If they are offering bottom round but you want leg of lamb, just say no thank you but please bring leg of lamb and next thing you know they will be at your table with it. They brought our table bottom round but we wanted sausage and leg of lamb, next thing I know three servers are at our table with sausage, leg of lamb, and lamb chops. The food is amazing and the verity is nice. Most places that offer an all you can eat buffet style have a few good things and the rest is sub par, that is simply not the case here. Every thing they had to offer was high quality and delicious. The price makes it a place where most people would treat it as a special occasion, but you will get your money's worth and leave happy.

The only negative I can possibly think of is that nagging feeling in the back of my mind that it is just . . . too. . . . much. Just too much of everything. The whole experience constitutes a sort of embarrassment of riches.  But that's what celebrations are about, and thus this is a great place for a celebration.",

I think you can go and just do the salad bar and it would be good in and of itself. The meat did come and come and come. all great, the only reason I didn't stuff myself was that I wanted that super new York cheesecake for desert. I am soooooooooo glad I did.  when your in the area this is a must stop.",

    "text": "This place was excellent. We came here for my birthday and it did not disappoint. We prepared ourselves by abstaining from food all day so by night time, we were ravenous. When we first arrived we were seated quickly since we had made reservations, thank god we did since it was pretty busy when we got there. Our waiter went through the spiel with us about how the whole process worked since it was our first time there, he seemed extremely busy but he was always kind and there when we needed him, +1 star there. I decided to visit the salad bar and ended up with some smoked salmon and asparagus. The salmon was delicious and the asparagus was abnormally large but also great nonetheless. Abnormal veggies, +1 star. Right when I sat down, the filet mignon came by so basically, it was meant to be. It was cooked perfectly and extremely tender. It was a melt in your mouth kind of good that could bring a grown man to their knees. Yum. +1 star. Then right after the filet the lamb chops came. I'm pretty sure this is the part I died and went to heaven. Cooked to perfection and the spice on the lamb chop was tasteful and not overwhelming. +1 star. Other meats then showed up which were good but let's be real, the filet and lamb chops held a place in my heart already. I do have to say though, the chicken and bacon wrapped filet were a bit dry. Other than that, there were no complaints. Since I'm the type of person that always has room for desert, we charged on and ordered the molten lava cake. If I didn't die before, I definitely did now. It was a melt in your mouth warmth and heaven of chocolate, if chocolate was a drug then I'd happily OD on this everyday. When we pierced the outer shell of the cake the chocolate on the inside flowed like a baby chocolate river, it doesn't get any better than that. So basically, +5000 stars. My first time experience was off the charts and I cannot wait for another excuse to go again!",

Half of my plate was the scrappings of fat I had to trim off my pieces of meat. The salad bar had nothing to choose from other then cold veggies and hard rice. I was at Texas de Brazil in Chicago last week and for the exact same price you had triple the salad/ buffet bar, great meat vs this disgusting cheap cuts of meat offered here and even though everyone here was very nice, it took forever to get drinks, refills, and we had to ask for someone to clear our plates after an hour of being there. I will never be back and its a shame because theses places are normally wonderful.",

For lunch you get the same food for a cheaper price but even the dinner price is well worth it. It was a buffet style restaurant, where you pay one price and get all the food you can eat (except dessert+drinks). We started at the salad bar but there were so many good food that my plate was full with no space for the meat so I had to get a second plate. They give you this card where you flip over when you want to be served with the freshly cooked meat. They have their servers walking around with the meats looking for people to be served.  We tried every type of meat on the menu and I loved it all. They even had bacon wrapped meats which were amazing (who doesn't love bacon?). Did I already mention the service was excellent? Well, they have a friendly staff who are all very efficient. When we asked for a particular meat we were craving, they would bring it right away. When we asked a question about the restaurant, they gave us an informative answer. Lou who seemed to be the customer service manager, came to our table asked how everything was and had a good sense of humor. All-in-all I was blown away with the Brazilian Steakhouse experience. Definitely coming back soon!",

    "text": "Do you remember as I do, playing The Oregon Trail video game on your apple IIe in elementary school? The part I always loved(besides naming people cool names), was the hunting feature.  You would shoot a huge buffalo and could never carry back your entire compliment of meat.  Well, old school video games beware, Fogo De Chao has figured out a way to carry back the entire tomb of meat and place it right on your plate.  No joke, I have never seen more protein in a confined space.  You have around fourteen  options of different meat and by the second round, the types really starts to blur together.  There is filet, strip, chicken, sausage, etc...  The theme, is that comes hot and in mass quantities.  At first look the price tag looks pretty reasonable, but do not expect a  couple to get out of here for below $130 with tip. Yep campers, its around fifty a person for this all you can eat meat extravaganza and \"salad bar.\"    The salad bar is a collection of eclectic items that really do not seem at all like they belong on a salad bar.  That being said, it doesn't matter, because the meat coma you are entering does not allow for further eating, other than the meat.    Now that I have been here once, I imagine I will go back someday, but not in the near future, my stomach is going to need at least another month to digest it all.  Good service, absolutely advertised as what you get for the meal, have to give Fogo a solid rating.",

Inside it looks like you are at someones wedding reception at a nice catering hall- nice, but unoriginal.  All of the staff were very kind and helpful and we soon got down to business. The salad bar was my garden of Eden! Mushrooms, beets, humongous asparagus spears (genetically altered, perhaps?;) ) the basil dressing? Amazing. I loved it, and even my veggie-shy man enjoyed some of it's offerings (bread and butter!).   Time to get meaty! I have never had so much hot meat in front of me at one time! We quickly learned what we liked (filet and ny strip for me) and what we didn't (bottom sirloin still visits me in bad dreams). I tried two pieces of chicken that were both hard as rocks and a pork sasuage  that was ggggross! I had more uneaten meat on my plate than i had consumed, so after about 20 minutes I cut off the meat flow and went back for seconds at the salad garden.  Before leaving, we finally saw the lamb chops coming around. I love them and had to try them. My first bite was pretty decent. But each subsequent one was fattier than the next. Blech! Enough for me.   I will mention the sides, although they were truthfully unmentionable. The \"crispy polenta\" was overcooked and greasy, the plantains looked nasty but tasted ok. The potatoes were the best of the worst, and we actually ate them. But overall, the sides aren't worth the room in your belly. We had none left, and therefore passed on dessert.  I'd go back for the salad bar, it alone costs $20, but I think it's worth it. Everything else, meh.",

Stopped in the bar for a drink and had a nice glass of wine, server was friendly & helpful. Server explained the concept to my FIL, who had never been to a churrascaria. Salad bar was nice, just icked up a few nibbles (olives, prosciutto, roasted peppers...) to complement the upcoming meatfest.   It's all about knowing what you like.  Best of the meats: the two top sirloin selections are spectacular, as was the lamb chop and lamb t-bone. Juicy & flavorful/ Ribeye was super tasty.   Worst - leg of lamb was overmarinated, the pork ribs were cooked fine but needed some sort of rub/seasoning, the bottom sirloin had great texture but was kind of bland.  Passed on the chicken, sausages and filet mignon.  Service was prompt, attentive and polite without being overbearing.  A great meal, and a fun/different experience.",

One cut of the fogo house special was very tough and inedible. The salad bar was ok. Not a whole lot to choose from but I was there for the meat anyways. The sides they brought to the table were good. The fried Polenta sticks were addicting. And, they had my favorite cake on the desert menu! Tres leches! So over all for the price ($50 a person) I think they could have done a better job on the food. The meat especially. Oh the staff was really nice and helpful. One of the waiters even offered to take my sons bottle in the back and wash it for him after he dropped it.  Lol on a side note the people sitting next to us who looked at us all night like we didn't belong there were stealing food and putting it in their purses lol I thought it was funny.",

There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, so just to confirm:  -- The interior is beautiful and their wine selection is very impressive. -- The salad bar contains all that is good.  TRY not to spend too much time there, but I must confess that I loaded up on the cheese (parmigiano reggiano FTW) and smoked salmon. -- All of the side dishes (which are also endless) are winners. -- The meats are all very very good, but some are more impressive than others.  Their Alcatra is amazing, especially if you get an outer, crispy slice.  It's basically beef bacon.  Also, their lamb is superb -- seasoned just enough to expose the flavor of the meat.  Their chicken unfortunately falls short compared to everything else. -- Go for lunch.  It's the exact same experience for ~$15 less per person.    It's a bit pricey, (~$30 lunch, ~$45 dinner) but it costs about as much as the high end buffets in Las Vegas or a high end steakhouse, and it arguably surpasses the former in quality while easily beating the latter in quantity.    Bottom-line: Save up on both your cash and your calorie intake and then indulge like the glutton you are.",

I've been to places with a reservation and they would say \"Oh it'll be just a moment\" and 10 min later...  Right as we sit down, one of our many wait staff comes over to us to take our drink orders and lets us know that we can begin our meal.  They have a huge salad bar, but I was told by a friend \"Do NOT eat it if you want to fill up on meat!\"   So my girlfriend got the salad bar and I ate some of the cheese. It was delicious!  We guys flipped over our card to green and it was on.  We must have seen 10 different guys come by with different meats.  My favorites were their house special, sirloin and filet wrapped in bacon.  We ate like kings!    To top it off we even had room for cheesecake.  I highly recommend this place. It was pure heaven.  It is a bit pricey though.  ABout $50 a head.  But soooo worth it!",

It's super fun to try all the different meats and not get full on just one. Service was spotty on Thanksgiving, they were very busy, I get that but we could barely get water and ice tea refills. At one point, my husband walked over to the bussing station and grabbed the water pitchers and ice tea pitchers and filled our drinks. (This was after waiting a good 15 mins with no one coming back) And it was difficult to get meat! It seemed as if they didn't want to come over to our big party! A manager did come towards the end and ask us what we wanted and he was able to get the guys to bring the pork ribs and ribeye. Towards the end a server named Eric came and started taking care of our table and he WAS AWESOME! I was thankful he took over . On a day other than a holiday, service is great , the food and experience are awesome and the managers are attentive as well. The holiday was just too busy for them.",

I've gone to Fogo in Dallas and Kansas City for years, and each time, the food is amazing, the service is impeccable, and the restaurant is beautiful. We always have a wonderful experience and feel that it's well worth the money.  The Scottsdale location... no. It's large, and the restaurant is nice, but the service is not good. The gauchos regularly came to our table and were attentive, but our dirty plates were not cleared until as asked, our sides of fried polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas became cold/empty and were not replaced until we asked, and our cheese bread also ran out and was not replaced until we asked.  Usually, sides and bread are replaced quickly, whether they're cold or empty, and several people will ask how we're doing and if we need anything. That didn't happen here. After we were done eating, we sat for a good 10+ minutes waiting for the table to be cleared so we could get dessert despite several servers walking by.  I just wasn't impressed. It was not the good experience I've come to love. I will happily go to other Fogo locations but I think I'm done with Scottsdale.",

    "text": "\"....they need more meats on a stick...\" - Ben Stiller as Ted in There's Something About Mary.  I think he meant they need more gauchos running around in a restaurant slicing it up for me to indulge in.    I brought a friend here for dinner.  He had never had the churrascaria experience so I thought I would help him improve his dining experience exponentially.  The first great thing, apart from the food, was the parking set up.  There's complimentary valet parking OR your friend can park a 100 yds away from the front door so he can laugh at you while you negotiate beds of tiny rocks in your stilettos.  Anyway, this location is soooo much better than the Beverly Hills one that has super atrocious parking.  To the good stuff....I made my friend order a caipirinah and I ordered a Mondavi Pinot Noir to start.  We hit the salad bar and my friend was like what is all this weird stuff.  Who cares, just dump ranch on it!  They had a really yummy apple salad that I had never tried before, but I like to load up on the hearts of palm, artichokes, and buffalo mozzarella.  Along with never having had the Brazilian experience, my friend had never had filet mignon....smh...you poor sheltered thing.  He tried the bacon wrapped filet & chicken first.  I watched him de-virginize his mouth with filet mignon.  It was pornographic.  Then we tried MY personal fave, lamb chops medium rare.  I also had the bottom sirloin which was a little too skirty for my liking.  Oh, this kid also tried his first bite of polenta....christ almighty...and he liked.  We finished off dinner with the papaya cream dessert, which was papaya blended w/ vanilla ice cream topped w/ creme de cassis, and 2 snifters of B & B.  Oh, you've never had B & B?  Kiss the enamel on your teeth goodbye, but it tastes absolutely delish!  We had phenomenal service at a great price.  I got more bang for my buck here at this location.  What I spent here on the AYCA, dessert, & booze was equal to the cost of the AYCE only price at the BH locale.  (What's the exchange rate of the Cali $ to the AZ $....3 to 1?  I love it!)  For a casual yet buzzing dining experience, bring your self-proclaimed sheltered friends here for a meaty, treaty taste fest, flip to green and it's on!",

    "text": "Fogo de Chao is a place for the vaguely gluttonous meat-eater who enjoys watching the fine-tuned ballet of service whirl around the room with roasted meats and downward-pointing carving knives. We went for restaurant week ($44 a person with an unexpected dessert included) on a Saturday night and the giant space was PACKED. The service was completely stellar though with a host of waiters, meat presenters, clean-up crew, and managers checking in with us for the whole experience. Our waiter guided us through the experience as I had not been to this particular Brazilian steakhouse before, suggesting sauces, pointing out special items on the More-Than-A-Salad-Bar farm table, bring the side dishes of mashed potatoes, plantains and fried polenta, and making sure out favorite meats made it to our table. The salad-bar cold options table is great with items like marinated mushrooms, roasted vegetables, imported cheeses and cured meats, pear and endive salads, hearts of palm, and much more. If I was a vegetarian, this would go on my list of lunch places just for the salad bar options alone as they are much more exciting than a selection of spring mix. The meat selection was a bit more standard American fare than other Brazilian steakhouses to which I have been, but everything was cooked so perfectly it was amazing. My favorites were the beef tenderloin (for which I waited a couple times for the perfect medium rare slice), bacon wrapped filet mignon, parmesan crusted pork, and the roast lamb, that had a lovely seasoning on the outside yet was perfectly cooked and juicy in the interior. (Special kudos for Dan, one of the managers, for being so friendly, checking in with us several times, and orchestrating the return of the beef tenderloin when I missed it the first time.) Drinks are pricey by general Arizona standards, yet pretty expected by Scottsdale/city rules - I particularly loved the passionfruit caipirinha. Overall, we had a wonderful time as the food was great, service was amazing, and just watching the whole experience in the general dining room was entertainment in itself.",

    "text": "Ferrari's + Fashion + Filet = Fogo de Chao   Maybe it's just me, but I felt out of place here. Well, I am getting up there in age and no longer feel a part of the \"in crowd.\" As we parked our car (yes, we parked our own car and didn't use the valet), we saw Ferraris, Mercedes, Escalades, BMWs and they were everywhere. My husband and I drive a Lexus, so we're not exactly chopped liver, but the car display here was over-the-top.   Then, there's the \"eye candy.\" Granted it was \"AZ Restaurant Week,\" so the restaurant was bustling with high energy. There were so many gorgeous young girls in stilettos and spandex dresses that were two sizes too small; I'm not sure how my husband was able to concentrate on his food.   As for the food, it was good. The salad bar is huge with exotic and high end offerings including: tender fresh asparagus stalks, apple salad, hard salami and prosciutto, shaved authentic Parmigiana Reggiano, sun-dried tomatoes, and freshly made buffalo mozzarella.   Here's how the all-you-can-eat carnivorous feast works. After you've had your fill of the salad bar, use your special coaster to let the waiters know you're ready. Flip the coaster to green to signal food service or red to take a break. Each waiter carries dramatic skewers with different meats. There are at least a dozen different varieties of beef, chicken, lamb, sausage, pork. Once we flipped our coasters to green, those waiters swarmed on us like flies to honey. Truth be told, it was overwhelming, almost scary. So we quickly flipped our coasters back to red so we could enjoy our feast. I was surprised that many of the meat selections were dry. Maybe they could set some flavorful dipping sauces on the table to provide moisture and a variety of flavors. But perhaps that would defeat the purpose of showcasing the meat?   At any rate, I can see how many people enjoy Fogo de Chao. But for me, I'm not a fan.",

Second time we planned a family dinner with our daughter and her husband and our son.  Service was TERRIBLE.   First thing we get seated, and the hostess stands their holding our menus for about 5 minutes and says nothing to us, after a few minutes we are all sitting there like what is going on.... She finally speaks and says she is waiting for our server, finally our server gets there and the hostess gives the menus to our server for our server to hand them to us.   We order our drinks, 4 of us order drinks my daughter just wanted water, 4 of us got our drinks fast, the water took about 15 minutes longer to be served wtf? Meanwhile another server at another table drops a bowl of mashed potatoes all over the floor, some other person comes and tries to sweep them up, I nearly died laughing.  So the food is good.... The meat is excellent. It's all you can eat, they didn't come take our dishes when we were finished, I stacked a few in the empty spot and they sat there pretty much the whole meal. We order desert, we order desert all 5 of us.  They bring the desert out which is also delicious, but they put candles in 2 of the three birthday deserts sit them in front of us, we have no silverware for about 5 minutes, we figured they were going to come back and light the candles?!? We sat and waited purposely to see how long it took for people to even notice, we finally flagged someone down to bring us silverware. Anyhow the food is good, our bill was $348...if I'm going to spend that kind of money I expect excellent service.  We won't go back for a 3rd time.",

    "text": "After knowing about, but never having lived near a Fogo de Chao, I was very excited for my first visit. I visited on  Thursday night with a group of about 50. Service was dismal. I had to flag down a waiter after sitting without a drink for over 10 minutes. It took that long to get the drink & the waiter stood in the middle of the room with no idea who to give it to. We asked repeatedly for hot rolls, only to get a basket of 5 cold rolls for our table of 10. The meat was rarely brought back to the room. They would go to the large table first, ran out of meat, and never return. If we asked for rare, they would promise to return, never to come back. When the waiter came to ask what we wanted for dessert, I told him I had only had 3 pieces of meat and would like more. We finally got tired of waiting for food and, after most of our party of 50 had departed, we gave up & left too. In total I had a lamb chop, a small cut of filet, a tiny sausage, and 2 chicken wings. Not worth $50. I would have had more than one glass of wine if the waiter had ever come around and asked. I also would have appreciated not having to ask repeatedly for everything, down to a glass of water (hot rolls, hot potatoes, more bananas since 4 pieces isn't enough for a table of 10). Everyone at the table was complaining to each other that they were still hungry. I would not recommend this place for large groups. Small parties may work, but they are far too disorganized and unwilling to serve. I would not ever expect to have left hungry, but I did.",

    "text": "Carnivores Dream or overpriced buffet?  I had eaten at Fogo De Chao about 6 years before this visit and I had fond memories, perhaps because I was celebrating my 24th wedding anniversary. This visit was an ok experience but not what I expected. When you enter the restaurant, you're greeted with warm, rich tones and textures that lend themselves to setting expectations of a fine dining experience. When you're seated, you see servers with beautiful skewers of different types of meat that look good enough to immediately get your mouth watering. That was actually my favorite part of the dining experience; the expectation of what was to come. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there.  When you're handed the menu, you'll notice there are only a few options that basically amount to meat and/or  \"The Fresh Market\" (aka the buffet), the new Sea Bass and the buffet or just the buffet. There were also some dessert options and some drink options. You'll also notice there are no prices listed, so you have to ask (sometimes repeatedly) to get a full understanding of what to expect price-wise based on the combination of options you choose.  When you get your drinks you might be surprised to find what you were using for a coaster, really isn't a coaster. Our server explained how to summon the meat carvers to you by turning up your round paper coaster size circle on the table from red to green. That meant that a few of us first had to take our glasses off of the \"coasters\", lol! I think at the other Fogo De Chao, they used plastic poker chip styled discs to call your meat server.  Since I'm not a big meat eater but was joining a group of family for a meet-up, I decided before I made my choices; I'd check out the buffet. I recall from my prior visit in another city, Orlando, there were great items on the buffet.  I was disappointed to find the selection not even up to the expectation of a good Sunday Brunch buffet at a hotel. Sure, there was salmon; thinly sliced like what one might have with lox and bagels; and there were capers and onions for good measure. However that may have been the most extravagant item on the buffet. Other than that there was your standard fare veggies, salad and potato salad. (When is the last time you went to a nice restaurant and had potato salad?! I personally don't know of any). I will give them credit for having a quinoa salad option. There were also many items without a label that I had to guess at what they actually were.   So, unless you are going for the meat, I wouldn't recommend it because at about $32 for the buffet and a drink, there are better ways to spend your money.",

    "text": "Now, this review is in regards to my visit on 06/11/2017. I've been too busy to write out what I wanted to say but I figure now is as good a time as any.   This was my second time at this location and I was severely disappointed. First off, I waited at the entrance for a couple of minutes in full view of staff walking by before my presence was even acknowledged. It wasn't busy or anything so I was a little confused. As soon as I called out to someone, I was met with an extremely apologetic greeting which made me feel a lot better. At least I knew it was only a matter of someone not seeing my party and myself walk in. No big deal.   The food looked amazing and it smelled great. My family sat down and made our drink orders. For anyone who has never been here, it's a little pricey so don't expect to be paying any less than $6 for a cute little bottle of beer. But it's a gorgeous restaurant and the service is usually impeccable.   I perused the salad bar and gathered what I needed to make my own smoked salmon bruschetta. The smoked salmon didn't really taste like anything. It usually has a delicate flavor that's very noticeable. This salmon tasted as though it was soaked in water for a while. Some areas of the fish were darker than others so I didn't wind up eating it.   In addition to the salmon, I opted for the chicken salad which actually tasted delicious. But I couldn't finish eating it because I bit down on a chicken bone. I was so sad! After that, I didn't trust the salad so I just pushed it aside. I didn't know what could be done about it but I did let the server know and he immediately informed who I imagine was their supervisor. Someone came to my table to make sure the bone didn't cause any oral injuries which I thought was very nice. It's not the worst thing I've found in my food so it wasn't a big deal. Besides, I was really there for the meat.   Now, on to the meat. Every single piece of meat that came out was incredibly bland. This was a stark contrast to my first visit which was phenomenal. With every piece of meat I tried, I hoped the next one would be a little more flavorful. It wasn't and that was so disappointing. I had raved about this place to my family and it left so much to be desired.   We stayed for maybe thirty minutes - just long enough to try everything. None of the meat had any real flavor so we got up, paid our bill, and made a trip to Rodizio's in Mesa because darnit, we were determined to have unlimited meats! Fortunately, the meal was redeemed in Mesa. They don't have the variety that Fogo has but what they do have is amazing and so delicious - and it's almost half the cost of Fogo. In fact, Rodizio's left such an impression that I'm reluctant to try Fogo de Chao again. Reluctant but not unwilling. My first time there was pretty amazing and that smoked salmon was spectacular.   I'll try anything once, twice if I like it, three times to make sure.",

Funny enough the person I was with wanted well done ( go figure ) and sometimes they had to wait for the next round.  Service was five star.   It appears the servers were very on top of it asking if there was something special I wanted.   Sometimes I was actually taking a break and they would ask if I wanted something special.  There appeared to be some new items circulating like pork chops and chicken breast.     But as always the beef ribs and the rib eye were my favorites.  Thanks guys for turning it around!",

They probably don't have the best food in the area (I know it's pretty dumb to compare their steaks to Houston, Ruths Chris or Paul Martin because they are cooked differently but the info may be useful for some people), but their service is absolutely the best. The restaurant was full when we were here but there's nothing for us to complain about their services. The waiters replaced our dirty dishes every 10 minutes. They even refilled my water like 4 times when my water drop to 1/2. Unlike other restaurants where there's only 1 waiter responsible for your table, in Fogo, you can ask anyone anytime for your requests. When we asked to take our wine bottle home because we couldn't finish it. They put it in a bag for us and then seal it. VERY PROFESSIONAL.",

What can I say about a restaurant that feeds you delicious, incredibly delicious food and when your plates are empty, brings you more. There is something for everyone. I am a vegetarian who enjoyed the large array of foods from the salad bar which included papaya, pineapple, vegetables of all sorts and potatoes. The servers made us feel like we were part of the family as they let us know what was good and steered us in the right direction. They reminded us to go easy on the salad bar and start with papaya to cleanse the palette and that was just the ticket. Thank you, thank you for a wonderful experience.",

My review is a *WARNING* when you dine here.....someone in the staff is skimming credit card numbers and stealing. Two people out of three had our credit cards compromised and fraudulent charges day of our meal and day after our meal. It isn't rocket surgery to figure this out, we are from out of town and got into Scottsdale on Sunday. The first and only use of our credit cards at the same place was Fogo. Within four hours of dinner one card was compromised and the second was compromised hours later. The first fraud was a credit test at a Tempe gas station.  These are the reasons we know it originated at Fogo.  Food was fine, but maybe not at the risk of your credit and all it takes to correct.  Bring cash if you want to risk it.  Shame on you Fogo staff...",

Our initial server never took our drink order, never offered us bread, and didn't ask if we'd like extras. Luckily the table next to us had someone attentive initially help them.. she saw us sitting there and took our drink orders and offered bread (you share servers). Honestly, the servers were the only part of the evening enjoyable. Very attentive. The chairs are too tall for the tables (mind you I'm 5'4\") making the seating uncomfortable. Some of the tables aren't located in the best spots, so by the time the passadores arrive to our table, most of what's left on the skewer is extremely bloody meat. I'm a fan of medium rare, but I'd prefer to not have a bloody lump of meat on my plate. I could've brought the meat home and threw it on the grill and it would've been better. Very disappointing. The buffet was scarce as well. I just don't feel that this particular restaurant lives up to the True style of Churrascaria that I'm familiar with. My husband and I left feeling unsatisfied and sad that we spent so much money. We won't be returning-as the area has so many amazing places to eat wonderful food and this restaurant in my opinion isn't one of them.",

Our reservations were ready on time on a busy Saturday night. The place was packed. We each ordered a drink ($11 each) and settled into our table. Our waiter did a good job explaining how it all works.   We found the salad bar to be full of delights: fresh greens and various chopped salads, meats and cheeses, toppings galore and a few nice surprises, like Hearts of Palm.   We didn't overfill since we knew of the meat bonanza to come. I can pack away a hefty meal but my wife is petite and I knew I would 'lose money' on her with this place.   During the entree portion, we sampled the top sirloin, bottom sirloin, pork sausage and chicken. The other varieties came around after we were full.  We both enjoyed the top sirloin the best and the chicken the least (overcooked). The fried bananas were excellent but the garlic potatoes lacked imagination.   The service was great, if a bit slow at the end. The food was good but a bit overcooked for a guy like me who likes medium-rare red meat.",

They have a very very nice \"salad\" bar. Not like put a bunch of lettuce on your plate, but just nicer. There are several pre made salads...kale and citrus, quinoa, a watermelon salad, pear and endive salad, fancy potato salads, etc. What sets it apart though is the variety of other items....kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, capers, fine cheeses, roasted vegetables, even smoked salmon.  There are so many delicious items, including soup. And they also bring a few small hot plates to your table....plantains, polenta fries, and garlic mashed potatoes.  A pleasant and delicious surprise. About 15 bucks per person. And perfect to take your carnivorous family and not have them say \"you can't eat here can you?\"",

I wasn't blow away/the choices were very very minimal I have to say that if we are paying that much I think that they would have a better array especially fruits. My family was pleased with the meat selection but they said that they didn't get a lot of great choices till the end when they were completely full up. Drinks are expensive!

Salad bar came complete with dead flys as protein; manager didn't even have the courtesy to come out apologize for the dead insects in our food. They gave us four options of meat that rotated every 20 minutes, and when they did stop, they gave us chunks of fat, or a slice of meat so thin my toilet paper was thicker. Paid the $100 bill and left a zero tip. I never do that, but the waiter looked like a deer in the headlights when we showed him our food. An apology would have been nice for giving us poor cuts of meat. I wish i spent the money at Longhorns or Yardhouse. You won't catch me dead in this place again. I'm upset I even have to write this.

We get there, tell our waiter it's our first time and it starts out great. The salad bar is amazing and the meats start coming. That is when the manager, guys in button downs, come by asking if we want any kind of meats or sending different cuts our way. The food is great! But then this man comes to the table and tells us they just started a new dry rub steak and we have to try it and asks us how we would want it cooked. We were super happy with the meal, everything was delicious, the rolls everyone raved about were fantastic! Then the bill comes... We see that the steak was $75! We were never told there was an additional charge for this steak! I bring it to the attention of my waiter that this is a considerable amount of money for no one to mention prior. He apologized and agreed that it was a large sum not to be told about, but proceeded to bill us the full amount and think nothing of it. Then on the way out we saw the man that had told us to get the steak. He said he had told all the tables that night and we were the only ones that had a problem with the additional cost and we obviously didn't understand what he was saying. We told him again that he did not tell us the steak was extra and again he acted like it wasn't his fault and there was nothing for us to do. I am so shocked!! This is robbery! Insane that they would sell addons at the table without them knowing the additional cost until they get the bill! What if we didn't have the $75 extra to pay for it? This was a special occasion and I am not rich by any means but even if I was, I would still want to know when I am ordering something that is not a part of the regular dinner. I will not be coming back and will definitely be warning others! This is so deceitful and unethical that this restaurant is treating their patrons this way.

What's the point of a reservation if the restaurant overseats and doesn't honor it?  I don't care how good the food is (and I may never know) because I won't dine someplace that treats its customers that way.  Thanks for ruining father's day!",

Which didnt taste any different than tap water. There was no warning that we were getting charged for water! BEWARE of hidden charges (my reason for 4 stars)! We started out with the salad bar, which included in the dinner price of $59.95. Then came the meats...we had parmesan pork, house special sirloin, garlic steak, sausage, chicken legs, top sirloin, bacon wrapped sirloin...there was probably more that we didnt try. All of the meat was tender and cooked perfect...melt in your mouth good. You can buy wine by the glass or bottle. They have a large selection of beer, wine and mixed drinks. We of course had to end our meal with dessert. Hubs and I shared a strawberry cheesecake. It was as big as my head! So delicate and yummy. We would go back, but most likely on a special occasion.",

In addition, Chris Rachford, went above and beyond by making a dessert which is no longer on the menu that was a favorite of the guest of honor (a little girl) at our lunch.  Other members of the FdC staff were equally great! Angelica was very attentive and came by our table regularly to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal.

They have all types of options for meat including beef, chicken, pork, and lamb so there is a little something for everyone. My tip for first time goers is to pace yourself while eating. They are going to constantly be coming with more meat but you don't have to eat as fast as they come. That's how you not get full ten minutes into the meal. Also save room for dessert because the  cheesecake is HUGE and amazing!",

The salad bar had lots of delicious veggie friendly options. Everything was well prepared and fresh.   What made me really enjoy this place was while it was upscale it was never stuffy and the service was impeccable. If you are eating meat you have a little card you place red side up when you want to be passed over and green when you want the server to come over. When my coworkers cards were green I don't think they ever waited more than a minute for someone to cut off a piece of meat. This was one of my coworkers first visits and he said everything was delicious but his favorite was the Parmesan pork.",

We had asked our waitress twice, the person refilling water once and finally a manager came by to ask how our meal was going -that's when we got our refills.

    "text": "Here come the meat sweats, people. Like most traditional Brazilian churrascarias, Fogo de Chao offers an all-you-can eat experience, starting with a buffet-style salad bar, which puts most salad bars to shame.  They go beyond the boring mixed greens and put out a huge spread of cheeses, fruit, rice, soups, veggies, potatoes, toppings, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc etc, ETC. Then there's the Brazilian cheese bread, served table-side (my favorite), along with fried sweet bananas (my second favorite) and oh---I almost forgot the multitude of servers walking around the dining room with skewers of freshly grilled meats ready to fatten you up. At the tables, each diner has a two-sided card at their place setting that lets the wandering meat guys know whether or not to stop by and offer you whatever it is they're slicing up. You just flip the card to let them know how you're feeling. One on side, it basically says \"BRING ME THE MEAT\", and on the other is something like, \"LEAVE ME THE EFF ALONE\"... I don't remember exactly what is says since I didn't flip it to that side all that much.    The variety of meats is pretty impressive. Lamb, pork, steak, sausages, chicken and even different cuts of meat.  If you have little self control, you may get into a lot of trouble.  As for the quality of meat, it's pretty standard...so, don't expect prime or the best product--it's all-you-can eat, after all.  Servers aren't assigned particular tables (it's pooled) so anyone can help you.  I wish we were told that initially, so we wouldn't have spent 20 minutes trying to find the first random waiter that took our drink order to get another one. I was pleasantly surprised at how big and busy/boisterous the restaurant as a whole was.  Our two, loud-mouth, chatty, tornado toddlers blended in just fine.  Oh, and the best part?  They eat for free.  Kid-friendly ALL THE WAY, baby.  It definitely makes the $50-something price per person (for adults) so worth it. Romantic and intimate?  Not so much. But it sure has that somewhat upscale, modern and sleek look that makes it feel like you're about to have a fancy date.  Then it's pretty much like the DMV but without terrible attitudes from the staff and the lines here actually move (I'm from CA and don't remember what the equivalent is in AZ is and am clearly too lazy to google it at this hour).  Overall, we had a really good first experience.  We'll definitely be back, wearing stretchy pants (and no shame), and eat our weight in grilled meats and cheese bread. So, I suggest you do the same!",

They put it on the table anyway. The staff is usually friendly and attentive. Not this time.   I wanted the NY strip and was told by my server they do not have is. I told her they do. She came back 5 minutes later and said I was right, and said it was on the way. 10 minutes later, still not there. The manager stopped by. I told him I was waiting on the strip, the place was freezing, and the service was bad. He said it was 50 degrees outside and he would check on the steak. Never came back.  I gave up and asked for the check. She asked if we wanted dessert. I said it was my birthday. They give dessert on birthdays.....usually. Not this time!  Better service at Golden Corral.

The salad bar did not disappoint either.  The options were exotic, and typical, but all was fresh and flavorful and paired well with the meats offered.  At then end they provided complimentary cake which was so moist and delicious as well.   We ordered a bottle of wine and this was my only complaint.  The bottle I chose was one of my favs and I normally get it for $12 at the store.  They charged $46. I feel like this is overpriced.  I don't want to pay 400% over retail for anything.

We made reservations, parking was pretty easy, and we were seated exactly at the time we reserved for.   It may have been because it was Valentine's Day, but the place was just so chaotic. It took about 10 minutes before someone finally brought our drinks. The tables are also super close so you can pretty much hear everyone's conversations around you. The restaurant itself is very nice, but it's a bit awkward walking to the salad bar when you're just inches away from someone else as you're trying to navigate through. It kind of reminded me of one of those more formal dinners you have on a cruise. We also heard someone arguing with one of the waiters about already giving another waiter their card for their bill, so be sure to keep your eye on who you give your card to! That was probably just a random and unusual situation though.  The salad bar was pretty great. They have cheeses, salami, bacon, and other salad toppings. The actual meat serving was neat too. You're given a card that you can flip up when you want someone to bring meat to you. They have different types of steak, chicken, and pork. If you make the amateur move that we made, you might eat a bit too quickly and be done with the whole experience within 30 minutes.   The prices are on the higher end. It's about $55 for the churrasco experience (unlimited meat/salad bar) for dinner, but drops to about $30 if you go during lunch. There's also an option for just the salad bar experience which is about $25 at dinner, but I don't think that's really worth it.   The place was a fun experience, but I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "We were so excited for this experience, but it fell flat. The service was sketchy, giving them a pass as any place can have an off night. Food was delicious. I could have just eaten that roasted pineapple all night. Then the service got really weird. One of our servers offered gratis dessert because of the weirdness that happened while getting seated. When another waiter noticed my husband looking like he was not enjoying his experience (we weren't), suddenly we had more meats table side and pleasentries then we could handle. My husband asked for rib eye and they all disappeared again. It finally arrived after asking 2 different staff and the original server coming back to ask if he had his rib eye yet. Clearly he had not, but it had been long enough to where he could have already had it served and consumed. I asked the 1st server for the desert menu when we had finished with the delicious main dishes, she brought it, explained the options and then poof, again. Finally the other server came over and asked if he could bring us anything else, it was so disjointed, we were not sure if one knew what the other was doing, we were pretty sure not so much. Husband asked for the check, when it came he said they gratis my husband's iced tea for the wait at the beginning. Really weird. Most people seem to be having a special occasion (birthday, special event) and seem to be really enjoying themselves but we were just there for  Saturday date night dinner and to experience the service of the meat and it just did not seem special, so in that regard it's really not worth the price of admission unless you're experiencing a special occasion which we may do again because we really did enjoy the healthy options at the buffet sides bar, the roasted pineapple (a keto no-no but I threw caution to the wind) and the sauteed onions and mushrooms accented the meats perfectly. Pretty sure we will try again, it was that tasty.",

We both kept saying, \"We will try again.\"  But it was not chewable and filled with so much stringing unbreakable gristle and fat.  Both parties on either side of us were saying the same things.  I think we were all surprised that it was that bad.  My husband and I did eat the chicken and pork which were edible but not very tasty.  I have never given a poor review on Yelp.

I took my friend for his bday and lets just say is was horrible and we spent $263.47 for the most gross meat I have ever eaten in my whole life. The meat smelled like they were killing the animals in the back and putting them on the grill to serve to us. We never received a server so the whole night who ever passed by is who we had to flag down just to get those boxed mashed potatoes and that nasty looking dessert. I'm not sure why every piece of meat they serve smells the same but that's gross. When i woke up the next morning my husband poop was so strong I almost ran completely out of our house. It's 10 hours later and my stomach is so swollen I'm considering going to the emergency. I wouldn't recommend this place to my enemy. Complete disappointment for the price. I will never go there again!!! Also I did not leave a tip cause I had no server to leave a tip with.",

With Our last experience they bring around side dishes like mashed potatoes for your meal. After a while we had gotten some but then we never got anymore. The manager came over to talk to our table and asked if we wanted more potatoes. We said yes. Still never came. Another waiter came over to check on us we asked for more potatoes and again still never came. In the end we never got more potatoes to accompany our meats. Then they were asking if we wanted to try a sample of a red wine infused drink. I got one. Then our bill came and that little sample drink was $12!! Probably should mention that it's not a sample!!! Then also when we got our bill they tried charging us for a whole bottle of wine when I only got 1 glass. Then on top of it we had to wait over 20 mins and ask 2 different people for our check. Like I said good food and fun experience but service sucks!! I would expect better service with how high priced the place is.",

First of all, if you need to make special arrangements due to coming here with a large party, this place has the best deal.  We got 2 drinks included with the meal (not limited to only wine and beer) and a wide choice of desserts were also offered within the cost per person.    Overall, a pretty good range of good quality meats where you need to come hungry and be ready for protein night.  My favorites, filet mignon, rib eye and lamb chops.  You get the best bang for your buck when sticking to steaks and lamb verses filling up on chicken and sausages.  But chowing down on their cheese bread is a must since it's incredibly delicious!  Service was outstanding when handling our large party and we got top notch attention throughout the night.  Carvers make sure to ask what meat temperatures you like and remind you to get your tongs ready to grasp your meat when they cut!    Perhaps there could be some improvement in the salad bar (ceasar salad gets pretty soggy quickly when sitting for awhile) but overall, Fogo de Chao does a really nice job all the way around.",

Once we were seated the server came to us offered drinks then we went off to the salad bar which I mean had everything and anything from veggies to cheeses to cold meats and salmon, so much stuff to choose from!!! They also had other hot sides I believe I saw rice and black beans but tbh I did t try any of that so can't tell you about it, anyway we had everything and anything I mean from the lamb to chicken and steak it was all just perfectly cooked super juicy and well seasoned, we even got free dessert for our anniversary and I ordered the cream Brule which was just freaking amazing! I seriously fell in love with this place, my drink never went below half empty, servers always up to what we were needing the (manager) or Someone came out to ask how everything was and honestly it was such an amazing experience!

    "text": "We absolutely LOVE the food here and have been in multiple times but I have to say,  last night was extremely disappointing from the moment we walked in until we left.  I had my newborn with me and requested a sling.  The gentlemen set it down and watched me put the baby into it securely then mentions that it might not be a good place to have the baby in because it would be in the way of the employees slicing the meat. So then why would you put it there to begin with and then wait until after I put the baby in it to mention that??!!  Second, a waiter comes up to the table numerous times while we were waiting for our guests being very aggressive and trying to up sell us things we were not interested in. We were there for the delicious Brazilian meats not seabass.  He was very rude and arrogant in the process. We had to ask multiple times for items that were missed or never brought out at all.  However,  given that it is a team effort where you get multiple servers that come up to the table I can see how things might be  miscommunicated. That leaves me to the final and the most disappointing part of the evening.   My father in law drove up last year  from out of town for his birthday and liked it so much he drove into town again requesting to come back to this restaurant again for his birthday. Last year I spoke to our server as well as a manager explaining that we would like to surprise him with a molten chocolate cake for his birthday. It never came out.  They offered him the desert menu,  he chose the molten chocolate cake,  they brought it out with no candle or birthday at all.  I approached the manager asking what happened.  They apologized,  came up to the table and told him they were going to surprise him with a desert.  Ummmm, when you tell someone about the surprise is not really a surprise plus we already had the one that was supposed to be a birtday. So they basically ruined the entire moment.   Last night I arrived early having a conversation with THREE people including another manager explaining what happened last year and basically begged for it to not happen this time.  Unfortunately that was too much to ask because for the second year in a row the same thing happened!!!!   The best part was apparently they were closing,  the servers were circling our table like sharks impatiently waiting for us to leave.  Meanwhile, I was still waiting for them to surprise the guest of honor with the deserts we preselected and spoke about. Our main server said no one mentioned it to him but after speaking to 3 different people I can't understand how this happened,  AGAIN!!",

She kept trying to get us to purchase a bottle of Malbec which we weren't interested in. Third, the salad bar was measly at best. It was so weak, and there was hardly any \"salad\" in the salad bar. It was an awful experience we will NEVER go back. Needless to say we left before eating anything.

    "text": "I recently had the worst experience here. I had a large amount of family flying into town to celebrate my uncle receiving an honorary doctorate at his Alma Mater. The culmination of the weekend was a surprise dinner for him at Fogo. As a professional event planner, I emailed the private dining salesperson (who was lovely) and together, we made the decision that sitting in the main dining room would be a better option for my group because we didn't want to be married to a minimum spending amount since my lovely 85 year old grandmother was treating. Although we did not get the private room, we were informed we could come early to set some menus and decor on the tables.  When I arrived to the restaurant at my reservation time, I was informed that my table wasn't available. What? I had made a reservation and my entire family was on the way. I peered into the private room and it was not occupied. So, a lovely hostess found the \"manager\" and asked him if we could use the private room. He gave me some schpeel about we can't because of a myriad of different bogus reasons and stalling and then my husband and I finally sorted through his BS to hear that another group would be coming in.   Okay, no worries- that makes sense. BUT Then, the \"manager\" proceeds to tell me he was actually lying and that there was no group in there tonight but he didn't want to give us the room because we are not \"his\" customers and had previously contacted the group sales manager (as one would). He said \"his\" customers can get the private room at any time with no minimum or anything. I said \"Great! We would love to be your customers, we are here now and will definitely have a bill of over $2,500. He said no once again because we aren't \"his\" customers.  What? Isn't everyone in the restaurant \"his\" customers? His pompous attitude and aggressive demeanor COMPLETELY ruined our night, had me fuming and my husband minutes away from going off on this pretentious snob. He continuously talked over me, insulted me and never once apologized. Congratulations Fogo on ruining a once in a lifetime event for my family and uncle.",

The staff was friendly and outgoing, and  I felt welcomed. The food on the other hand, was okay. Sadly, It did not knock my socks off. I hoped for well flavored meat, and the meet served did not meet my expectations(left me looking for steak sauce). The buffet was well organized and offered great choices of sides. Moreover, the mash potatoes were tasty and helped the meat taste a little bit better. Dessert was pretty impressive, I had the cheesecake--it was rich and very flavorful--it had drizzled strawberry sauce, which complimented it well. This restaurant is okay, but way overpriced when compared to other Brazilian steakhouses.",

I will say it was good, but I stuck with just taking tomato slices and some of the hard cheeses. The meat that came around that blew my mind was the lamb, not the bone on lamb, but the lamb meat skewer thingy. So good, seriously, I am not a fan of lamb, and this lamb was so good I kept asking for more (which they kindly oblige). So the salad bar options aren't huge, but damn, the meat is crazy good. You will enjoy this place if you eat the carne good stuff!",

I was in a group of 7 and the table placement was poorly done with constant interruptions from people trying to squeeze through between table chairs, given the very close proximately with other tables.  Our main server's attitude was decent but slow at best.  Actual meat service was almost none existent, in fact when the meat service would enter this backroom area, they didn't have enough left on the skewers to even make it to our table (except for less popular items like pork sausage).  Only once, did the crown jewel \"filet\" make it to our table - with very little left to just serve a couple of us and a broken promise of returning with more.  It was clear, this section of the restaurant was treated as an afterthought.  Multiple times we complained about this fact with only slight improvements being seen.   The food itself was good but I'm completely floored with the per person price tag a better customer experience wasn't made a priority.",

I was actually taken here as a guest of my aunt and her husband and I felt very guilty because even though I do eat meat, I feel like I did not eat enough to make it worth it to bring me.    The salad bar is amazing.  Its top of the line food including mozzarella balls as big as a child's fist. The thing is, if you are there to eat meat, then don't fill up here as the big show is next.    You get coasters that on one side are red, the other side is green.  Think of a stop light, red is stop, green is go.  Men with spits of meat will walk around and ask you if you would like a cut of what they are serving.  There is beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and sauages walking around.  As long as you are flipped to green, they will keep coming.    When you are finally done with all that meat and you somehow amazingly have more room, then totally go for the desserts.  They are out of this world.  I got the tres leche cake.  So amazing.  Along with the pinot noir we got, this was a very decadent meal.",

It took awhile to get the waiter to come around and explain the process to the 'newbies'-Drinks with the pao de queijo (warm cheese bread) was a delicious start.Salad bar was fine, but seemed the attendants were a bit slow to get the items refilled/replaced. After that, though- everyone was thrilled with the array of meats that flew off the skewers when the Gauchos came around- all the meat was fabulously done.  Some of our party ordered desert- but I favored the caramelized bananas . Everyone really enjoyed the experience, no doubt, we will all return.",

    "text": "\"Where do you want to go for your birthday?\" \"That place with meat on swords!\" ... Said the manly carnivore that I call my boyfriend.  Fogo totally lived up to the hype and was for sure a unique dinner.   The salad bar is epic in proportions. It's the size of my living room and family room together in length, multiplied by 2 because there's food on both sides. There were at least 10 things that I had no idea what they even were, but they were delicious vegetables or cheeses of some sort. There is a freaking barrel of parmesan cheese that you saw off a hunk yourself, for God's sake. It's amazing. I could have been happy with just the salad bar.  Then the meat. Yes, it really comes around on huge sword-like knives, and they cut you off a hunk of at your chosen temperature. I only sampled the top sirloin, rib eye and filet mignon (sad, I know), but Carnivore McGee got through 13/16 meats and by my calculations, ate over a pound and a half of meat. It was all delicious by his standards. Ladies, if you want to entertain yourself at dinner, bring your man to Fogo and watch him go from blissful looks to saying \"Must... eat... just one more piece!\" and struggling to force himself to wave away the servers.  The service was great too; we had no problems as some others did. There are a couple waiters who are actual waiters and manage drinks and checks and such, and there was always one of them within eyesight. The meat never stopped coming either, it was continuous throughout the hour we spent on that course. One of the meat servers (he's got thick wavy black hair and an accent) was a total sweetheart and chatted to me about how I liked my cocktail (one of their Brazilian sugar cane liquor ones) and educated my boyfriend on the 3 different cuts of lamb, and even ran back to the kitchen specifically to get him a sword of one of them. THAT was wonderful service.  Oh, and to take the mystery out of the prices (they don't list them... anywhere... \"If you have to ask, you can't afford it\"), here you all go:  $29.95/person at lunch, $49.95/person at dinner.  Tip: Be careful with the Caipirhinia cocktails; they are extremely strong, and they are $13.50 a pop. Some sticker shock ensued with that one when I got the bill!",

No matter whether I'm at Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.  A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really \"date night\" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks.   You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.  The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?  Nice wine selections here. Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin.",

    "text": "I went to Fogo de Chao last week during AZ Restaurant week with a couple of friends. Unfortunately, this place didn't really rise much past mediocre (read on)  Fogo de Chao is a typical, although nicely done-up Brazilian steakhouse establishment. The building is grand and colored in nice deep earth tones. It was a Saturday so it was packed, but nonetheless, we had reservations and were seated quickly once the whole party arrived. Brazilian steakhouses aren't really my thing, but I've striven to be impartial on this review.   First, the salad bar. There is a nice selection of things here including fresh vegetables, prosciutto and a giant parmesan that people hack into. So, on to the first two major demerits:  There was smoked salmon on offer, but the particular slab on offer here was frozen. At these prices ($19.50 just for the privilege to graze the salad bar, but comes with the normally $46.50 free-for-all per person price), this is a screw-up that is not even close to being acceptable for a simple salad bar setup, and of course the price compounds the level of disappointed that I reach. I know that Americans are into big, but the parmesan was puzzling given that this is a block of cheese that is either shaven or grated, or enjoyed in deliciously rich chunks. It was impossible to get a nice shaving out of this thing as there were no decent implements to get into the parmesan well.   Second, the meat service. There was a nice meat selection, and overall the meats were of good quality and quite tasty. However, I did notice that the cheaper cuts of meat were much more plentiful and forthcoming. Our table actually had to actively ask for them to send over the lamb, pork tenderloin, and beef ribs. We were also told that some of the cuts were unavailable. The complimentary sides were delicious. The cheese bread, polenta and bananas were lovely.   Dessert was just uninspiring, boring, pre-fabricated crap. It was free so I can't complain too much, but in normal circumstances they're probably charging in the high $9 to mid $10 range for a thin, crappy piece of what I think is anything but homemade cheesecake with an uninspiring combination of HFCS, sugar, red food coloring, and a couple of strawberry seeds that was the sauce. My friend had the chocolate mousse cake which was equally uninspiring and crappy. I'm not expecting a superstar dessert, but at least make an honest attempt at quality.   The booze is WAY overpriced. $12.25 for a \"Premium Caipirinha\" ... are you kidding? And, to boot, one of the things that pisses me off to no end (and results in major loss of critique points) at high end restaurants ... BILL ERRORS. We had a total of two cocktails and were billed for four. Simply, unacceptable. We weren't even brought a revised check before we handed over our credit cards for payment, and what's worse, not even an apology from the server regarding this $25 whoops on the bill. The only saving grace of that incident is that we were charged correctly in the end.  So,   Overall:  C to C+                Fogo de Chao has a lot of potential to be a great Churrascaria                as it bills itself to be. On this particular occasion it didn't really                rise much past mediocre given some borderline egregious                 failures in service and food quality. Some plus points for                great interior design though.   Food:     B-      (Big plus points for great meat. Minus points for the                           piss poor attempt [if I can call it that] at dessert, and                           frozen smoked salmon on the salad bar)   Booze:  C-      ($12.25 for a Caipirinha? Give me a break!)  Service: C     (Service was overall good. Near failure in service for                        the bill error. The only saving grace was their                        responsiveness when we asked for something specific)",

Our CA company loved the fun of it and the food and the experience.  We would take company again although it is too much for hubby and me - we are not meat eaters - we did try the chicken wit our salad bar and enjoyed that - tasty - we are normally fish eaters.   I do suggest a try if you want something different.  The service was good - somebody at the table all the time - the side dished okay but not memorable to me.  The salad bar I will remember - thank you. We did think it was odd they did not come by and ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee at the end of the meal - we almost always have a coffee - maybe the four of us would have split a dessert to celebrate a little but we were handed the bill and her hubby paid before I realized what happened - that seemed rushed - with no menu and no one else appearing to have dessert or coffee that may be the way it is.   Thanks for an overall fun experience - our company was happy.",

    "text": "Underwhelming and over-priced.    Mrs. Wanderer became a fan of churrasco, Brazilian barbecue after eating at the outstanding Via Brasil in Vegas last year so we popped in Fogo de Chao to see how they compared.  Answer: not favorably.  The best thing about this place is the physical appearance of the restaurant but it's all downhill from there. Two star food, one star service and a four star price.    The salad bar was just okay but really nothing to get excited about. We were much more interested in the meat courses than messing around so after a perfunctory pass at the antipasti we had the waiter clear our plates and waited for the meat to begin.  And waited. And waited some more.  Waiter after waiter walked by us, huge spear of meat in hand, head down, studiously ignoring us.  We finally managed to flag one down by literally, yelling.  We didn't know what else to do since we'd been waiting at least ten minutes for somebody to serve us and we were hungry.  We finally got some meat and it was fine but then the same thing happened on the next course.  For the next hour we played this game where the waiters would walk by us doing their best to avoid eye contact and we'd try to intercept them.  It's very hard to avoid concluding that they are really not that keen on giving you meat here which kind of negates the point of being a churrascaria.   The three sides were all mediocre and unmemorable: soggy microwaved bananas, mashed potatos and fried polenta wedges.    For this kind of money, I'd much rather eat at Ruth's Chris or Morton's.",

We were both impressed with the service and the food. Since then we have visited Fogo De Chao in Scottsdale and have loved every minute of each experience.   My husband and I came here for our first year anniversary. We made the mistake of eating a huge breakfast at Bill Johnsons Big Apple. One shouldn't do that if you plan on going to Fogo De Chao.   For New Years Eve we again visited Fogo De Chao with some friends. Service has been impeccable all three times we went (both in Houston and in Scottsdale). Our wine and water glasses were never empty and our table was always clean. The wait staff were kind and always remembered our favorite cuts of meat. The Lamb Chops are my favorite. The Bacon Wrapped Fillet Mignon is to die for!  I am a definate fan of Fogo De Chao!",

    "text": "I'm not a big meat eater, but my god, if this was my last meal on earth, I'd die a happy (and uber stuffed) woman. My friend was visiting and she's from Argentina so this was kind of similar to the way the meats are prepared over there. We decided it would be wise to basically starve ourselves (with the exception of water) before our dinner at 7. We also decided to skip out on the salad bar and went straight to the meats to ensure that we could get maximal stuffage in our bellies. They also give you an unlimited ammount of yummy sides (mashed potatoes, sauteed bananas, polenta cakes and this awesome cheesy bread that was so moist and fluffy). Since there are over 15 choices of meats, I'll only name the ones I really liked and ones you might want to skip.   Good meats: top sirloin, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, flank steak, sausage, and lamb chops (I am not a lamb fan, but boy was this good)  Skips: chicken wrapped in bacon, lamb shank, and pork tenderloin (only because ours happened to be dry)  The guy that seated us gave us helpful tips and pointed out this place is similar to other Brazilian buffets but with better looking servers. Agreed =)  One of our servers told us the reigning champion is a 115lb woman who ate 12 lbs of meat on her birthday (with 2 plates of salad, and a plate of desserts). Gross. Steve Nash apparently can only eat 5-6lbs.",

The waiters were incredibly friendly, and fellow patrons as well- when our neighbors at the next table found out we were celebrating they sent over a bottle of Moet :) Would definitely come back with more meat-eaters for special occasions.

If you want rare, you can get dark red and bloody, if you like well done it's just a slice away. Deserts are perfectly acceptable and usually compliment your dinner perfectly. The only downside is, soda is served in 10az cans that come to 2.50ish each. I racked up just about $10.00 worth of diet coke, but I didn't come for the coke and the meat was so tasty that it really didn't bother me, maybe it should have. This is a great place to go for those celebration type outings, guys will probaby appreciate it more than the ladies, who probably won't eat their monies worth. Bottom line: if you haven't been, you have to try it at least once, and probably twice, and maaaybe three times if your pockets go that deep.",

Everything from fillet, to lamb, to the most incredible chicken wrapped in bacon. Yes my friends bacon! This place is the closest I have come to man vs food.  Not to be forgotten is the salad bar. The salad bar is a vegetarian delight in a carnivores lair. Decidant cheeses, fresh vegetables, pastas, and starchy concoctions to satisfy your inner vegan.  The service was outstanding, even with the $50 a plate cost. I have several meat-a-terian friends I will be sharing Fogo with.

While other types of meat like the top sirloin and bottom sirloin were constantly being offered to us. I felt like I was just waiting and waiting to try certain menu items! Fogo needs to work on varying up the choices that pass by the tables. Other than that, no complaints.

The servers are all dressed as if they're about to hang out with some bulls in Brazil. I love character dressing, so it impressed me. They sat us down immediately. One of the servers in our area explained how it all works. He said that we could start at the salad bar first or turn over the card to the color green to start the all you can eat meat \"buffet\". We decided to try out the salad bar. The salad bar itself is incredible. It has this amazing caesar salad, olives, roasted red peppers, charcutterie, cheeses, and the most amazing potato salad I have ever had in my life. Honestly, I would just eat there, but at last - I had to try the meat.   We flipped our cards to green and immediately someone came by serving us pieces of meat. It was delicious. We had parmesan Pork Chops, Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Lamb Chops, and some type of sausages. Besides, the parmesan Pork Chops, it was all really delicious. After the amazement died down, we both realized they kept coming around with the same type of meat/poultry. You're allowed to ask for what you want, but even then it took a WHILE for that to come by. You would think that most of these meats would have a medium rare option, but most of the time it was well done. And who eats steak well done? It's just too chewy at that point. Other times, it would be on more of the rare side. I understand that you can't always cook meat perfectly, but still. There really should never be a well done option.   Of all the Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, this by far the better one. Next time, I would come when they weren't as busy and spend more time at the salad bar!",

We waited a long time to ask for the bill, to receive the bill and to essentially get our cards back.  For the food -- it was okay. I have a few pieces that were inedible and found that there were only a few cuts of meat that were good (in my opinion anyway). We had the (I'm assuming) manager directing the guys who cut the meat to tables who complained about attentiveness to their demands including us, but once he intervened, the service picked up.  Okay experience and not worth the money. But my boyfriend enjoyed it, so it was good on that part.",

    "text": "Do you like meat? Do you love a great atmosphere? Are you human? If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, you need to go to Fogo de Chao immediately. Seriously, like right now. Stop reading this review and go.  Ok, welcome back. I'm sure you're as stuffed and immovable as I am right now. I weep that I am not Shakespeare, for I cannot put together the necessary words to adequately describe how amazing the food was and how awesome our customer server Lou, was.   Firstly, the food is phenomenal. I was expecting merely adequate meat with the whole gimmick being that the food is never ending and that they cut it at your table. I could not have been more wrong. The meat, the seasoning, the lingering, smokey flavor was simply the best I ever had. It took all of my willpower not to ask the server to take the slice of meat for himself and to leave the skewer. Tonight, while I am in the midst of a meat coma, I will be dreaming of their top sirloin and filet. (Sorry Kaley Cuoco, Fogo gets top billing tonight).  One aspect that guarantees that I will be coming back, too often for my bank account to recuperate, I'm sure, is the customer service. Derek, our waiter, did a great job of explaining the protocols to my wife and I as this was our first time there. But it was the Customer Server Lou, that really stood out and made the night memorable. I have experienced a lot of restaurant employees who checked on you simply because it was their job to do so, but Lou really cared, this was evident from his first introduction. He treated us like close family and ensured that we were cared for and well fed. I was celebrating a promotion, but Lou definitely stole the show. I can't say enough nice things about how great he was and how relaxed he made us feel.",

There is a salad bar available, my suggestion is to get the salad and sides because when you start the meat portion you will need to mix it up a little.   Turn your card to the green position and let the meat induced coma begin, my personal favorite is the bacon wrapped filet and garlic sirloin. The lamb chops are also a keeper. Keep track of what you get because it will start to look the same.  Would suggest on the first visit to try all the meats to see which one you enjoy. Don't eat everything but conserve your appetite so you can try as many things as you can.",

One of those times is was fantastic, one was average and one was a disaster.   Good food if you can get it. Avoid this place on a weekend when it's packed. I saw one person serving meat in the entire restaurant on several occasions one Saturday night. They seem to care only about serving large parties and probably selling drinks more than anything. Then when someone asks what meat I would like to try, they don't come back. I brought two friends for the experience and left embarrassed.   On a good night everything is wonderful!  Salad bar is pretty incredible. Huge selection of fresh veggies, salads, meats, cheese, etc. I'm tempted to just get the salad bar if I go back.   Bottom line, if you haven't been there you should go. Like I said, maybe try it on a weekday when you get better service. It's a fun experience and be sure to come hungry!  Enjoy!",

Food quality: 4.5 Stars I can see. taste, smell the freshness and quality of every cut of meat and the salad bar.  Service quality: 4.5 Stars Front desk is average. Gauchos and Servers are great.  Price: 3 Stars If dinner was $30 or $35, we would probably go up to 10 times a year. As it is, I can only justify going 1-2 times per year, outside of when they send me a coupon.  WHY SO MANY POTATOES???? Scalloped, baked, potato salad, mashed, etc.  Trying to fill us up so we don't eat so much meat?  I thoroughly appreciate the salad bar, even though i only put a few things on my plate before i let the meat finish me off.  All of the meats are prepared with great attention and detail. I even was able to try the leg of lamb and lamb chops.   Picanha and the Filet Mignon were my absolute favorites, while the sausage was unique and tasty too.  Take your time and don't let them run you out before you are done. At times, I feel they are trying to just turn over my table. When i am footing a bill well over $100, i feel like i should feel the service saying \"fica a vontade\", which is not always the case.  I will likely return for my birthday...or any other time they send me a coupon.  Fogo, thanks for \"matando saudades\" of Brazil for me.  Obrigado.",

The meal consists of salad bar that's can't even compare with a Sweet Tomatoes, and then the second course is meat, and meat, and more meat. I guess if you want dry chicken wrapped in bacon that's okay, they also have sausages, flank steak, rib eye, pork and filet. But for the most part our table saw lots of chicken, flank steak, sirloin that had way too much salt on it. We did manage a thin sliver of rib eye, and when we had to ask for horseradish it took a long time to get it. The desert, they do offer several choices. We had key lime pie, not exceptional just okay.  Okay then the kicker, the bill came for four of us it was 389.00 without tip, I know what your thinking, and no, we only had one drink per person.  So I rate them just two stars, if you want to try it make sure you know how much it costs.",

    "text": "I have only eaten at one other Brazilian Steakhouse (two if you count the one in Israel...but it was a standard steakhouse...not the Brazilian model where they bring the meat to your table) and this one FAR exceeded the quality of the other. Every thing about it was top notch. Atmosphere...upscale and nice. Salad or food bar (I can't call it a salad bar because it was so much more) was stocked with high quality foods. But, the thing that you go to a Brazilian Steakhouse for is the meat....and the beef could not have been any better. Every cut was flavorful and tender. I just wish I had been hungrier. I went for lunch during their summer special and only paid $25 so at that price the value was excellent.  Only complaint...don't order a soft drink. They come in VERY small bottles (10 oz I think) and they charge $3 each.",

As I don't eat red meat I opted for chicken..piece of breast..very dry,overcooked. Ditto on the leg,  i can't give opinion on the beef, husband did say it was good.  We both had cheesecake for desert. I think that is what gave us the food poisoning. Both of us got severe stomach cramps in the car..made it home just in time. First and last time we eat here. Glad the meal was free.",

I personally don't dine at buffets or all you can eat establishments so take this review in consideration.  I ate very little off the salad bar and definitely wouldn't come here for just that. It's great & all but why spend $30 at a salad bar? Make sure to eat the ribeye & filet. Don't waste your stomach space on chicken or pork or sirloin. IMHO. The little devilish bread biscuits you get are yum!   We were stuffed after this meal! Dessert was pretty good too.  I think one visit here is plenty. I prefer to spend my $ at a fine dining establishment with one steak versus 1o diff cuts per seating. Also, the sides could use some work.. No one really touched them.",

    "text": "Fogo De Chao was an amazing experience! It is basically an upscale buffet with the accompanying upscale price. There is an unlimited salad bar and all-you-can-eat bread, potatoes, and polenta. The same with the meat. It flowed non-stop! The chefs walked around with chunks of meat on a large skewer and cut off pieces for us at our table. We let them know if we wanted it well-done or medium-well and they obliged. We were done after several pieces, though. Think about it. How many steaks can you eat at once? What a profitable pricing scheme!  Beware of the soft drink prices, though! NO FREE REFILLS. I became suspicious when I did not see the prices listed. I used my phone to look it up online and there were several complaints from customers who were not told this in advance.  Would I return? Maybe once more to share the experience with someone going for the first time so that I may enjoy their reaction. Otherwise, once was enough for us.",

Fresh meat, all kind of meats, the food came fast and was like one after another. I also loved the salad bar!  Everything looks and tasted so fresh!  The restaurant manager, Marco Moretti, even came and greeted us.  There was a little bit of discrepancy but he fixed the problem with smiles.  He was so nice!

As it's said that there were different kinds of grilled meat but I only tried 3 bc as I mentioned earlier, took awhile for the server to come over with the meat plus there were just 3 or 4 servers with same meat come to serve.

Having said that, I was also never disappointed with the service either until my very  last visit. Despite reserving a party of 20 several days before-hand, we had to wait for more than 40 minutes for our table. Personally in this situation I usually cancel my reservation and go to another restaurant, but when you have 20 people with you, it is difficult to migrate to other places and feel obligated to wait.  I know for sure that next time I come here to not  bring large parties at this place. I gave 3 stars due to poor organization, but will give 5 stars for the food.",

    "text": "I have been to four such places in the Phoenix area and if you combine food and ambience this is the best by a mile.  The service was exceptional--we didn't have to wait for anything and people were coming by constantly not only to serve us a gajillion types of meat, but to check on our every need.  Refills?  Sauces?  A particular cut you'd like?  Anything and everything was available right away.  We got taken on a tour of the kitchen and it is huge and spotless.  There is also a private room which apparently is first-come-first-served and is no additional charge.  There is a salad bar with chilled asparagus, hearts of palm, and the most ridiculous artichoke hearts--literally just the very best part of the artichoke here.  There was a delicious chicken salad, potato salad, a bunch of cheeses, and cold cuts.  But of course, the main event was the meat--sausage, sirloin, leg of lamb, chicken legs, bacon wrapped chicken breast, bacon wrapped filet... and the best cut of filet mignon that I've had in a long time.  Tender, amazing, delightful.  This place also gets extra kudos for the fact that the servers ask as they are cutting the meat which doneness you want, which is nice.  I really enjoyed it.  Finally--the dessert was sublime.  Between the three of us, we shared the papaya-ice cream-black currant liqueur thingy, which wasn't too sweet but wonderfully subtle; the molten chocolate cake which would be the most perfect desert known to humanity if it had a few more fresh berries on there, and a wonderful creme brulee which capped off my birthday in the best possible way.  Gabi was evasive when I asked if it was her who ratted me out and scored me a free birthday dessert but I will go ahead and give her the credit since she's just so all-around exceptional.  Once again, an exceptional event--thanks to Yelp and most importantly, thanks so much to Fogo de Chao.",

If you love meat, this is the place for you.  I enjoy almost every cut of meat  and a few times I've ventured around the salad bar (it's beautiful, but as we know it's about the mean).   I've also sampled the various starches on the table (bananas, polenta) and I love them, but again it's really about the delicious cuts of meat coming around every time your card is on green.  If you go, go hungry and clear the rest of your schedule.  Even if you don't stay too long, you'll be in a lovely meat-induced sleepy state for the rest of the evening.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but when you think about what you get, both quality, quantity and selection it's really worth it.",

Simply because I am not used to eating this much meat.  Let me start with the salad bar- I would go there just for this!  Too many things to list, but,l trust me, you could fill up on it alone.  Many items  are non-standard to salad bars.    Ok, so then they brought out the side dishes.  I am a carb-a-holic and I could have died and gone to heaven right them.  Fried polenta squares, Sauteed bananas, cheese bread, mashed potatoes, etc.   Liked everything but the mashed potatoes. Then the meat started coming.  And kept coming.    I turned over my coaster to red pretty quickly, but my fellow diners were braver than I.  They kept eating and eating.  The meat all tasted good, but it all started to blend in my mind.  The only True standout for me was the lamb which was really, really yummy.  My mom, who is a genuine carnivore, asked if she could have a beef rib, not the meat on it which is what they usually carve, but the actual rib.  They gave it to her and she is still going on about how good it was.  I can't believe it, but my table ordered dessert.  I am ashamed to say I cannot remember what it was!  But it was really good, even though I only had one bite.",

    "text": "I finally got to try this place out.  After years of knowing about it and not doing anything about that I got my day.  Meat!  Lots and lots of delicious meat!    The salad bar was great, but I knew that I didn't come here for that.  I tried my best to be brief at the bar, but I couldn't resist.  Wonderful selection of veggies and cheeses.  Smoked salmon as well.  The hearts of palm were crunchy, the artichoke hearts were wonderful.  I was in love, but I was ready for meat.  First they clear your plate and throw down some side dishes.  Truthfully none of the sides looked tempting.  It was a small portion, but I bet if we wanted more, we'd get it.    The second you flip that button to allow meat, they come running over.  Skewers upon skewers of meat.  All of them were wonderful but some were better than others.  Stay away from the bacon wrapped filet and Parmesan crusted pork.  Both were not that good.  I also noticed that I prefer the meat when it's straight out of the flame.  If it sits around more than 15 minutes, it's not as good.  What I really liked about the place was the service.  Top notch.  They let us know right away that they work as a team.  So if we didn't see the server that first waited on us, we could ask anyone.  That was True.  There were about 6 people helping us at all times.  What I didn't like about the place was I felt a little rushed.  The rest of my party was done eating and I was still trucking.  Not only did they clear the table while I was still eating, the waiter even presented the desserts.  Dessert was the last thing on my mind while they were still bringing me meat.    However the dessert (if you can make it) were spectacular.  We had the creme brule and the molten chocolate cake.  Both were fabulous.  Overall, I'd come back here again and again and again.  It was wonderful",
