    "text": "As Americans, we love choices. It is not unusual, therefore, that an American bistro and drinking hole offers a choice of beer and wine. But this place taps into just about more than any other place out there --- around 200 beers in all. Yet, is it all really enough? The answer, of course, is yes and no.\r \r I for one do not need 200 beers. I need one: Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. That they have Abita Purple Haze or Portland Oregon Honey or even the Americana trophy Pabst Blue Ribbon makes no difference to me, except, that is to say, that the Yardhouse cares that people drink beer not just wine. In any event, if you're looking for new styles or brands of beer on any given night, this is going to be a place for you to go (at least in eight mostly Western states).\r \r I've breached the threshold of the Scottsdale Fashion Square version twice. Both times were pleasant enough. The staff seemed young, good-looking and attentive. The prices seemed reasonable. The decor and atmosphere in the cavernous space are corporate (surprise, surprise --- it's a chain). There are too many televisions for my liking. But I'm not a sports bar kind of guy. While lots of square footage means plenty of tables (i.e. no or limited waiting for a seat), hobbling through this massive place to the restrooms from the patio could be dangerous and embarrassing for some with, ah, control issues.\r \r The Yardhouse puts a lot of emphasis on eating. I suppose they don't want people getting too wound up on all those suds. With the exception of a handful of French fries, I have gone for the beer rather than the food. That said, the food looks good, the kitchen is open, busy and appears to be about as squeaky clean as the Yardhouse's image.\r \r Part of the fun comes with sitting on the patio. It's not that the atmosphere out there is all that great. Essentially you're sitting in a parking garage. But the people watching is spectacular. All the young Scottsdalians love valet parking, prancing around half naked and giving the impression that they actually have more than the minimum in their free checking accounts. Ah, if it were only L.A. Perhaps it wouldn't be so pathetic ... or funny.\r \r Cheers.",

    "text": "This is the worst of the Yardhouse locations in Phoenix.  The parking is a royal pain, there's often a wait, and this place gets annoyingly loud during popular sporting events.  Somehow this semi-yuppified place manages to attract all of the thugs who would normally go to a sleezy sports bar and scream at the TV there when their team is losing.  This Yardhouse is in a shopping mall, please go somewhere else.  Service & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley.  Beer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.  Prices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for most appetizers, and again - this location is bad for parking and customers.",

    "text": "Made the trip into Scottdale to visit Yardhouse Craft Beer Bar & Restaurant to see what 125 Tap Beer Handles looked like.  A mix of True craft, semi craft, pretend craft, imports & domestics.  I'll say this, there is certainly somthing for everyone.   I would like to have seen more True craft but with a selection that large there was quite a bit of beer to choose from.   I've heard more than a few complaints that all that Brew tends to sit in the beer lines far to long before being poured/tapped & goes Flat.  Having said so, we visited on a Sunday morning hoping the busy weekend would see all those beers poured through.  We tried quite a few different brews & only found only one truly out of sorts. The Belgian Sampler/ Flight was nice & the food was really quite nice.  The Sushi was oddly prepared, much like a small cake, but more than acceptable.  As their name might suggest, the Yard House had 1/2 yards of beer although I didnt see anyone drinking them. Can you drink a Belgian strong ale from one of those? All In All, not a bad trip.  3 Stars, could be better with more True craft beer. PS. It was truly difficult not letting any Scottsdale Stereotypes invade this review. Sure there were cougars galore & 30k millionaires eveywhere the eye could see. And yes, I'm pretty sure I saw Mike Tyson!",

    "text": "Yard House definitely played a role in my killer hangover this morning.  Arriving at 5:55pm yesterday my friend and I were able to squeeze in two martinis and two apps at Happy Hour price before HH coincidently ended at six.  Bummer.  Especially since happy hour martinis are $5.25  but at the stroke of 6, raise up to a bank breaking $9.25.  And they somehow cant fill them all the way to the top.    Dont get me wrong though, we stayed for another three martinis each, maybe because of the flirty, good looking mid-west bartender, or maybe because it was crowded and hot as balls across the way at Z Tejas and Kona.  Either way.    Yard House is home to roughly half a billion beers on tap so if you like beer or just like to get drunk, $3.25 pints at happy hour are the way to go.  If you cant make it before 6pm, try waiting til reverse happy hour later in the evening.  Or you can drink straight through both if you have the cash to purchase regular priced drinks.  Which I just hate.    Classic rock is the only music you'll hear here, EVER, even during a Pistons game which to me, really doesnt set the mood.  Try coming during a Suns game and they'll turn on the sound.  Great place to watch sports but arrive early, although its a big place, it gets crowded on game days.    Good people watching, snotty valet right out front...everything we love about Scottsdale.",

They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press.  The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all.   But the best thing about Yard House is the location.  It's right by Kona and Z Tejas and if you start right at 3pm, you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to Giligin's. Yes, I did this on Friday and it was TONS of fun. Try it.",

Not in the \"I'm on my way to becoming an alcoholic\" kinda way, but in the \"I want to dry a different beer each time I go out\" kinda way.  That being said, this was a great place to do that.  We were looking for somewhere to just grab a quick bite to eat before we headed to the airport and this was a great solution.  The food was easy (the generic menu that you'd expect--my burger was just okay) and there's plenty of grease to go around.  The service was fast and efficient, though not overly friendly.  The decor is exactly what you'd expect from a place like this--a bit loud with way too many televisions.    However, you can't ignore the fact that they have more beers than you can count and the waitstaff actually knows enough to recommend beers based on what you like.  I'm not sure I'd ever head back for a meal, but appetizers and beers are a definite go.  My recommendation:  any kind of wheat beer and the tower of onion rings.  Yum!",

All the waitresses I've ever had here are very friendly. The bartenders are a mixed bag. While I've found them to be nice, some of them are a little odd... like they say odd things or mutter under their breath or move your menu around on the bar while you're trying to read it, and then laugh.  I almost feel like they're ready to throw a spitball at me or something, like a passive-aggressive high school bully that walks down the hall with you, then slams you into a locker and laughs.

When I heard the trendy girls ordering  mixed drinks it made me want to point them in the direction of the nearest scottsdale scene bar and give them a swift kick in their $150 jeans .  Why go to the Yardhouse where there are so many delicious beers on tap and order some sugary horrible cocktail??  Alas, I am not meant to understand and I accept and embrace that fact.  The food is ok, nothing special and certainly not worth the price they charge.  If you are looking for an impressive selection of beer, show up to the Yard House  for happy hour, order a good beer or two and then head on over to Papago Brewing for the rest of the night.",

I love the warm vibe of this place, but it is a chain so they don't really have time to chat and get to know you at the bar. I don't believe I've ever had a conversation with any of the bartenders at any YH I've ever been to now that I think about it. Odd.   The menu is large, but again, doesn't stray far from the standard bar fare you find at most places like this. It lacks authenticity and the flavors are generally all muted.   Had THE best server; Jordan, and she took great care of us last night. They first sat us right next to the kitchen (I cannot believe they have booths right there!), but the clanging of pots and all the noise soon had me begging for anywhere but there. I specifically asked if, when we moved, they could still let Jordan wait on us because she is THE girl. She is personable, complimentary (my fave thing about her - hehe) and quick. If she couldn't get to me she delegated and got me what i needed immediately (we did move far away from her section and she was so nice about it!).   The beer flowed and it was good, but again, I'm particular to a certain brand that they don't have so I wasn't THAT happy, just moderately so. :)  The food was another story. Ordered the lettuce wraps with chicken and the chicken was barely warm and the sheen from the grease all over it made me a little ill, but that's okay, the calamari was worse. It was practically frozen. I was so disappointed because usually it's really good. We would have changed it, but we were starved. We also order the street tacos (asada and fish) and they were good, but for some reason instead of using corn tortillas to at least offer up some authenticity, they used this weird flatbread-tasting stuff. No bueno.   Oh well, it's a great place to socialize and the people are pretty here so it wasn't an all-together horrible experience. The bathrooms are super clean and the lighting is great for selfies so no complaints there. I'll probably always come here, it's just the way it is.",

Not only did she not bring us our drinks, she described the food as Panda Express-like (gross, I don't eat there), and she also never brought us our food. Instead, she rang in our order and had it delivered to the vegan table next to us. When our food finally arrived, BOTH OF OUR DISHES HAD HAIR IN IT. And my boyfriends order was wrong. And Amanda didn't bring us our food either. She actually only took our order. Then she never said a word when she dropped off the check, or when she picked it up. I was mortified at the whole experience. Please, DON'T eat here. We also mentioned to the manager on the way out how terrible the service was, and he just mumbled an apology. Oh, and we told him this while he was outside smoking. This was just a TERRIBLE experience!!!!",

    "text": "This location is a part of the mall, and can be accessed where the valet drop off area is. They are a fairly large location for the space, and have plenty of seats for just about any group size.   We headed in for a later lunch and even on weekends they have good lunch deals offered up. The truffle burger was very tasty and the fries were good as usual. Our waitress was very friendly and checked back on us often.  Sitting outside was fun since there is a TON going on out there and it makes for a dinner and show vibe. The downside is that this is the valet drop off site, so it also means that you get fumes and loud noises pretty regularly while eating.   Overall: A- Good lunch deals, especially for the area, and service was friendly and quick! If you sit outside, be aware that it can get loud.",

Our waiter was very attentive, our food came out at the same time, our order was correct and everything was good! This time I ordered the Caribbean chicken, it was nice and spicy, full of flavor with lots of different peppers. My friend ordered the Fried Chicken again and that was of course still delicious (recommend this dish). My original review wasn't bad, I just know that sometimes things happen, so it was nice to know that I was correct that things happen every now and then and this is not Yard House's norm! Definitely redeemed themselves! Good food, great staff, nice place!",

Today, I came in having one of those bad days, and the manager came up to me in a caring manner asking if I wanted any desserts on the house. I was astonished. He must have overheard me asking the host If we could sit in the corner not near as many guests. I was so touched. That speaks lengths about this company. I already love coming here, but now I will definitely dine here more often.   Nick was our server for lunch and was a sweetheart as well. For appetizers I recommended the ahi tuna with wontons and a avocado, or the crab, artichoke, lobster cheese dip.",

Both were BOMB and well-made!  The only food items that I have had here was a couple bites of fries that were shared with me and the [MAC + CHEESE]2 that has chicken, bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, truffle oil. The fries were crispy! The mac was heavenly.   From the two times that I have been to Yard House, each time has been clean and the staff friendly.

I've been going to yard house for years - particularly because I am Vegan and they have an awesome Veg friendly Menu. Well, tonight I went to watch my football game with some friends and apparently I got \"too excited and too loud\" for their \"family establishment\" and the manager came over and told me to quiet down. I am a 5'4\" dainty woman who had one drink and yes gets excited for her football. It was past 8 pm and yet the \"manager\" felt the need to come over and tell me they wouldn't serve me anymore because once again, all of a sudden, they are a \"family establishment\". I'm sorry but you serve over a hundred beers and you have televisions everywhere. If you want to draw a family crowd, have a happy meal and some crayons- don't get angry at the few patrons you have in the bar on a Thursday night. I'm disgusted by the way I was treated and I will NEVER, EVER return to this \"family establishment\". What a joke.

He finally came over and I ordered a blue moon with a splash of peach schnapps. I finish my drink and proceed to pay my tab. The bartender had charged me for a 'shot' of peach schnapps that had cost $7.25. My beer however cost $6.50. I had asked the bartender and he was no help. I then asked the manager, Francis, why my splash of peach schnapps had cost more than my entire beer. He responded, \"sorry, that's how much it costs.\" He was absolutely no help and didn't seem to care a guest was upset. Things like this go to show the lack of care management has at this particular establishment. I will be happy to never dine there again.",

I enjoyed the Mac + Cheese- which was a large portion of  chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta & truffle oil. It was truly delicious and I enjoyed every bite of it. I paid extra for a ceasar salad that was nothing special, but still good.  My friend enjoyed the  Rib Eye (12oz) with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans & shallot butter. She stated it was the best steak that she had ever had. She also paid extra for a salad, and felt the same about her salad, but she also asked for extra ranch dressing, which never arrived.  My friend  also enjoyed a bikini martini that I had a taste of. It was just lovely but due to the prices of the drinks, opted to not have one.  The prices were kind of high to us, and our server didnt really give us warm fuzzy feelings, and at times we felt sort of rushed to complete our meal.  I think perhaps as a special occasion I would go again, perhaps not.  But it was definitely worth a try and the menu is diverse enough to have something cheaper.",

But i usually get the same thing every time but i have ventured out of my comfort zone plenty of times. Service is iffy sometimes its stellar sometimes its decent sometimes its just okay. I usually don't pay attention because of the fact that i am more absorbed in the family time talk aspect so they really do not have my full attention span going.   Anyhow for food, i have tried the jambalaya every way except with noodles! still need to try it! Sooooo good though. I know i have tried some sort of chicken with a gravy and corn mashed potatoes i think that was awesome as well. But those were my top two. the mac and cheese squared is okay i am not a fan of all the portobello mushroom or baby bello mushrooms i just don't really care for the after taste. Now if they just gave me extra regular button mushrooms I'd be in heaven especially extra mushrooms and bacon! I have also tried their chocolate souffle for my B-day 2 years ago which was awesome!    My boyfriend had tried a sandwich before and was not too thrilled with it. But their shoe string fries are yummy. So its just about what you order that is important i just stick to what i know is safe for the most part. The ahi tar tar is bomb too. YUM.  Thats all i got for now until then....  This will definitely be to be continued....Stay tuned ;)",

I've had the fake meat in a salad, and it's very realistic - almost too much so! However, the most amazing item on the menu has nothing to do with fake meat: the grilled cheese.   TO. DIE. FOR.   Seriously one of the top 5 grilled cheeses. The tomatoes inside are roasted so they're sweet, warm, soft, and flavorful (as opposed to the usual sad treatment tomatoes get: simply sliced and put in the middle, cold, thus ensuring the surrounding cheese will never get hot enough to melt). The accompanying tomato soup is delicious as well. I snarfed it all down and practically licked the plate clean.  The service is always prompt and friendly also.   Minus a wee fraction of a star because smoking is allowed on the patio.",

My Son had the Caesar Salad which literally had two croutons and some lettuce for $6.95. The Turkey Burger was overcooked and just kind of blah. I had the BBQ Ribs which were unusually tough and barely room temp. The creamed style corn was made with fresh corn. I know because mine was soupy, way too sweet and it was full of corn silks, corn husks and little pieces of corn cob! The BBQ Beans were way over-seasoned with cilantro? Just tasted bad!

    "text": "125 beers on tap is awesome.  Not putting the prices of said beers on the menu is not.  The food is also really good, but food prices are also very high.  That aside, Yard House is a pretty cool place to grab a drink or a meal.  It's big and spread out and rarely feels as crowded as the rest of the bars in Fashion Square Mall. There's also dozens of TVs set up around the place, making it a good place to catch a game.  We had a send off for a coworker on Saturday night.  It was a big group, and the servers did a great job.  We took up a big table and three or four booths.  The solution...  They arranged a letter and number system with each of us, which allowed us to order drinks and food separately throughout the night, and it gave us a stronger guarantee that there wouldn't be a mistake on our tabs.  It was the letter of our waitresses' first name, and the order which we were served.  They wrote it down for us on piece of paper.  Even the drunkest person in the group couldn't get it wrong.",

There weren't a lot of folks out, so it was nice to have the bar practically to ourselves.   We kept it simple with some beer, a mojito, fried calamari, and crab cakes.  The food was not spectacular, but I suspect the venue is more about beers, sports, and a nice healthy dose of sports fan rowdiness.  I would love to see this place come alive on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.",

If you know how bad animal products are for your health and want them out of your diet, you really shouldn't eat here until they can actually offer vegetarian options instead of Falsely advertising.

It's a chain and it's Very Corporate, However in This Yard House locale at Fashion Square Mall, it servers them well, Service was fine, except it came from so many people, nobody had command of the service experience at our table. We had to constantly ask for what we wanted/needed for our table of 6, and it was delivered!  The food is always delicious and my favorite part of visiting YH. They have an amazing Calamari, and almost everything else is GREAT.  Lots of Craft and import beer selections, there are so many beers on tap, but I think they are based on margins not quality. A few of my favorite Belgian's and Micro's are nowhere to be found.  I have been to many Yard Houses all over the country because you can get a great meal in a pretty predicable restaurant/bar.  ORDER THE CALAMARI!!!!",

Their bartenders are eager to serve and help you order just the right food and new beer to try. I have found some new crafts I really like this way. A great example of their bar staff is a guy named Sal, who was a humorous and enjoyable lad behind the bar today at the Camelback location at Fashion Square where my daughter and I stopped in for a light lunch and a beer. Sal gives great food service, and pours a decent beer with a lot of pizazz and remembered to bring the extra lemons with my clam chowder.",

    "text": "This is my favorite Yard House in the valley. Located at, but not inside, Fashion Square mall, next to Crate & Barrel. It's large and spacious. The staff is always pleasant. On my last visit, our waitress was extremely personable and borderline comedic. Loved her!  There were only 3 in my party, but we ordered a ton of food. It was Happy Hour, so we took advantage of the slashed prices.   My non-veg*n peeps ordered Chicken Nachos (a huge portion! 2-3 people could easily share), Chicken Strips, Blue Crab Cakes, and a Pineapple Pizza. They loved everything they ordered.   I got my usual:  Gardein Sliders (hold the cheese & sauces). You get 4 sliders and they come with fries.  Gardein Firecracker \"Wings\" Gardein Buffalo \"Wings\"  Everything was beautifully presented and delicious! I especially love how they give you the same portions at Happy Hour that you get during any other time.   The restaurant is always clean, restrooms included. TVs galore, for you sports enthusiasts. And I personally love their music selection. Lots of 80s rock = mucho booty-shaking-in-my-chair-whilst-stuffing-my-face. This will continue to be my go-to Yard House.",

Place is amazing, great service etc.  Had the burger (3 on a five scale) and salad (average in many respects).  You can't go wrong as far as a place to hang out and do business deals etc.  One thing - if you are going to buy a t-shirt (I bought two of their shirts which are really nice and comfortable), make sure you buy it WHILE YOU ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE, we had to wait around 15 minutes after we closed out our bill just to pay for the shirts. Such is life I guess.  At any rate, definitely fan of the Yardhouse and have been to multiple locations!  Go for it!  PS Tried to buy the yardhouse hat but when you take the sticker off the bill, it shows a round circle there (need to fix that, it's like the products you buy that you can never get the sticker price off).  PSS Don't let me forget to mention they have the BEST music rolling there (I am not going to say what it is - you will have to go for yourself and check it out) but let me say BE CAREFUL you could use an application like Soundhound and spend more money on iTutnes songs than you pay for eating!! FUN PROBLEM TO HAVE THOUGH!!!  PSSS The BEST hamburger in town is at Bobby Q's off the 17.  I have a review on that.  Trust me on that one.  Find your sizzle!  Great job guys!!  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

The chicken enchilada stack is full of white meat chicken, beans, cheese and comes with two different sauces. The BBQ chicken pizza is plaqued by too sweet BBQ sauce, but the large slabs of chicken help make up for that issue. Still, one of the better and more reliable chains around the nation.",

I'm picky about customer service and the manager on duty who took care of my check provided me with great customer service and spoke very well and for that a Yelp review is in order.

If you are a beer lover, you will feel like a kid in a candy store. If you are lucky enough to get a knowledgeable server (hit or miss) they can even recommend combinations of beers that can make the experience even more interesting. Same concept as ordering a Black and Tan or Snakebite... but the flavors can get even more complicated if you are adventurous. Its best to go with a large group so you can all try each other's drinks if you really want the full tasting experience.   This place also has great options for lunch when you are at the mall and they don't seem to get busy until happy hour time. But for me, it can be torture to come here and not be able to drink since I am still \"on the clock\".",

The location was perfect because we needed to hit the Microsoft Store (and who doesn't love to visit the Tesla store, huh?!). I did research about food in the mall before I went to see what restaurants. Picked this one based solely on location, menu selection, and a few reviews. While online I could tell it was nearby (but unsure what floor it was located on), it was super hard to figure out on the mall directory. It wasn't on the directory's list of food but it was listed on the map. There were plenty of choices, so many that it was hard to decide. Even my sister had a hard time, and quite often there are so few options for her that she's the first one to make up her mind. Host Staff and waitress were super nice. Service was quick. Everyone was super pleased with their meal. We ordered the Truffle Fries with shredded parmesan and herbs = Yum! I had the small portion of Mac & Cheese with chicken and bacon and LOVED IT! (Thank you to restaurants for realizing that there need to be more than one portion size - because that was PLENTY of food for an adult's portion, especially if you order an appetizer) The gal we had as our server was wearing a shirt that labeled her as a Trainer - if the new folks follow her lead they'll be successful in the business.",

Yes, it's at the mall and the patio consists of watching the valet people, but the amount of beers and tvs do make this one of the few larger sports bars in Old Town.  The food is good and there is a huge variety.The only annoying thing is they play music during games instead of the audio for them.",

The appetizers are surprisingly large, I shared the nachos with my GF and it was enough for us both. They also make a really good tuni sashimi, I wasn't so sure about it at first, but it was delicious.  If you like beer you'll go crazy...the serving sizes are massive and it is like swimming in it, great choices, and good local drafts too.  A good upscale-casual hangout in the scottsdale mall area.

It's not the traditional sushi roll, it's even better. It's just a giant circle filled with tuna, avocado and cucumber. YUM. The nachos, wings and pizzas are really good too. And it's CHEAP. So much food for so little money!  They have a great selection of alcohol and they have my favorite framboise!   I've been for lunch and dinner too and it is also delicious.",

    "text": "I decided to give this place another try so when the bestie suggested meeting up for dinner I figured this would be the perfect time since she works right down the road.  We were greeted right away when we walked in and the hostess was able to seat us without any wait.  Our server then came over right away to see if we needed any drinks but he literally came over so quickly we hadn't had time to look over the menu so we just got waters to start.  Once I'd glanced over the menu I decided to go with the Sweet Tart Martini which was a concoction of raspberry vodka, sour apple pucker and tropical punch.  It's hard to go wrong with a mix like that.  For our meal we both decided that burgers sounded good so BFF got the Pepper Crusted Gorgonzola burger and I got the BBQ Bacon burger.  Right after we ordered my martini showed up in all it's turquoise colored glory.  First sip and I was in love.  This thing literally tasted like a sweet tart candy but with alcohol!  Somehow I managed to keep my composure and sip it like a lady rather than chugging the thing like I wanted to.  There was a little bit of a wait for our burgers but it wasn't too bad and we had a good conversation going anyway.  Once they did arrive I was pleased to see that my burger was actually cooked medium-rare as ordered.  I know I mention this a lot in my reviews but a lot of places don't get this right and I like my meat bloody in the middle so it makes me happy when a restaurant can accommodate me with that request.  I was in love with the garlic aioli that came on the side as well!  I was dipping my burger AND fries into that creamy goodness.  All in all I think Yardhouse definitely redeemed itself after my last visit.  The service was MUCH improved and the food was great as expected.",

Stared with the truffle fries which were good and Steven got the lobster macaroons which  was way to expensive and tasted like Alfredo with canned lobster on top and I got the ribs which tasted like it was heated up in a microwave. The waitress said the plate is hot (normally you can still move the plate not in this case) I went to push it further away and BURNT my fingers the plate was hotter than a fajitas skillet plate & was so hot my ribs sizzled on a normal plate, than my beans and corn sizzled along with it. $70 later not impressed.",

Yet there is no denying that my experience has been nothing but positive here. Food, beer and staff have been terrific and consistent. Because we are football fan wannabe's without actually possessing the ability to watch a game at home, we like to roll over here for our sports fix. And there truly isn't a bad view in the house, though I've never strayed from the bar.  The beer selection is of course...impressive. I love trying new ones and the bartenders are very patient with doling out samples for an indecisive patron such as myself. On that thought - the bartenders are pretty awesome. Always friendly, always attentive and insightful on both beer and food. While we pretty much always order the same thing (deviled eggs and truffle fries anyone?), I've like most things I've tried on the menu. This is a great place to accommodate the meatless crowd (self included) and even those that live sans carne get cravings for buffalo wings - mission accomplished here! Thank goodness for Gardein.",

He apologized sincerely to us and asked if there was something else he would like, and he also offered to pay for our entire meal. Of course we understood, and my boyfriend got a different entree, which he enjoyed just as much. The manager also offered us a free dessert, which we took home and ate later. I've never seen a more sincere form of customer service at a restaurant. He genuinely cared about our order and prepared and served it to us himself, making sure everything was perfect for our visit. I obviously still tipped our waitress and left a note saying how great their service was.  Other than that, everything was clean and appetizing!

My party of four did not make a reservation but were seated right away in a booth close to the door. I'm not a beer drinker and really you should be when you come here because there were yards of beer choices. There were also several cider choices, and I chose a pear cider. The option of a \"shorty\" was also very much appreciated for those of us who don't drink a lot.  I ordered the Cobb salad with shrimp, no egg and no ranch dressing. I had requested oil and vinegar instead, but when my salad arrived, I had to ask for the oil and vinegar again. No biggie, really. They were busy.  The shrimp on the salad were very flavorful and the rest of the salad was also perfect. I little different from the one that I had in Hawaii, but that may be because they use seasonal ingredients? I loved it all--the bleu cheese, edamame, bacon, and I ate it all (the large size) minus that one bite my hubby ate. Of course, that meant there was no room left for dessert. Oh well, maybe next time.",

Fish was blood red and so delicious. This is definitely a go to place!",

We ended up with an assortment of different types of food - salmon, pineapple chicken, pork burger, fish and chips - and honestly everyone was super happy. Really fresh and delicious. Plus lots of drink options for those of us not driving!   We will absolutely be back!!",

We absolutely hate the new thick cut fries and honestly we haven't gone back just because of the reason. The other food is amazing, but we really loved the shoe string truffle fries. Upsetting how we haven't gone back in a year because of this change. Can this feedback get back to their corporate?",

I asked my friend about her meal this am and she said her burger was horrible but she was starving so she ate it after smothering it with ketchup. It's nice enough on inside and the service was good.

    "text": "I'll start by saying I've been going to the Yard House for nearly a decade now. When I lived in North Scottsdale, we'd trek over to the Desert Ridge location, but now I just make sure I have lunch at the Fashion Square location anytime I'm spending a day at the mall. I love their Gardein meat substitute menu - when I first found out about it, I was *so* excited and it's never let me down!  A few days ago, one of my best girlfriends and I had lunch there and I ordered the Gardein BBQ Chicken Salad, my favorite. The food came out super quick, but I noticed my food was definitely incorrect - there were noodles and the smell of soy sauce and sesame oil. I asked our server if maybe the order had come in wrong, that this looked (and smelled) like the asian pasta salad. He apologized, quickly took it back and came back to let me know that the order had somehow gotten lost in translation. No big deal! He was very apologetic and told me my correct salad would be out shortly. I said ok, no worries! A few moments later, their head chef came out and apologized and let me know that, because of the mess up, they would be taking care of my lunch for me. I was shocked, in a really great way. I hadn't made a scene by any means (I've worked customer service for 9+ years, I know mistakes get made and who cares? I was enjoying a leisurely lunch anyway), but they really had amazing customer service and I was so thankful for their genuine level of caring about the mistake made, even though I wasn't upset at all! My salad came a few minutes after that, while my girlfriend was still only halfway through her meal! No harm, no foul.   Basically what I'm saying is, for amazing customer service, awesome beers, and tons of options, Yard House is tops. I always *have* recommended it, and now, after that amazing and unexpected experience, I will always continue to do so.",

Both burgers cooked perfect, came with some delicious sauce, and plenty of fries that come in a separate metal cup type thing.

We got the spicy tuna roll (substituted with the ahi poke, as recommended by Matt) and the chicken nachos (amaaaazing & so much leftover). Great decisions by us! Also, Matt saw that it was our anniversary and brought us a complimentary dessert (the chocolate cake with ice cream) which was a great way to end the night. The food was amazing, but still can't beat the happy hour prices, which will probably lead us to come back on a weekday instead of a Sunday night. Great food, great service! Will be back!",

I will say the drinks were decent but not worth coming back for. Service was bad too, friendly but sooo slow. Won't be coming back!",

Also, wine was $2 off so mine went from $10 to $8, which is OK for happy hour, could have been a little better, but not a big deal.",

I ordered the lunch combo which gives you the choice of 1/2 sandwich or 1/2 pizza with a soup or salad. I went with the roast beef dip sandwich that comes with au jus and a creamy horseradish. The sandwich was hot and gooey from the Swiss cheese. For the salad, I chose the classic ranch salad. This was fresh, crisp, and really satisfying! Definitely a 5 star side salad. I also ordered a side of fries which were decent (nothing special).   Overall, if you're out shopping at Fashion Square, don't hesitate to come here, but if you are able to leave the mall and head to the less \"chain\" restaurants for something different then do so!",

First of all our waiter, \"Garret\" was extremely un-attentive, slow and forgetful.  It was probably not his fault.  He was not familiar with the menu and forgot to deliver on simple requests aka \"water.\"  It just seemed like no one invested the time to train him.  The food here used to be creative and good - not anymore.  It is pedestrian, sloppy in appearance and flavorless - don't believe me? Order the lettuce wraps and get back to me!  We ordered mixed drinks and 5 appetizers outside of the happy hour time.  We thought that the avoiding the rush (empty restaurant) would deliver better service and good food.  We were wrong.  Sadly, the Yard House should stick to beer - the food and service needs improvement.  $120 down the drain!  All three of us agree on this review!",

I have been to other Yard Houses before (love the ahi crunchy salad), but the food and service at the Scottsdale location was disappointing. They have a ton of solid beers to choose from, and we also tried a few of their cocktails, but they all ended up being extremely sweet.  We decided to share a bunch of appetizers: crab cakes, egg rolls, coconut shrimp, lettuce wraps, and the tuna roll. The tuna roll and egg rolls were just ok, but the coconut shrimp tasted similar to fried chicken (and not a good kind of fried chicken). It just didn't seem right. Our server may have been having a bad or slow day, but she didn't seem interested in providing a good experience for us; she walked away while we were deciding what we wanted and asking questions about the menu.",

Service: hostess and waiter are friendly and courteous. However, I did feel bothered by the constant interruption of my conversation with my friend. I feel like they were trying to rush us out the door. Ok - u r done with the food now. Do u want dessert? If not, here is the bill. Goodbye. Wow! I didn't feel like I could spend more time hanging out a bit after I am done eating.   Food: I ordered the Rib eye and it was just ok. There isn't much of the flavor to it but it was cooked exactly to my liking (medium rare). We ordered the crab cake for appetizer. That was very juicy and delicious. The enchiladas dish that my friend ordered was a bit greasy but tasty.   Rating: I'll come back to try something else - maybe",

I was told my name and the pager were not accounted for and that they would clear a table right away. It took another 10 minutes and we were seated. One of the hostess' must of contacted one of the managers (thank you to her). A very nice manager offered 2 free appetizers for our wait (a nice gesture). I told the manager that we did not even get an apology from any of the hostess' and that they should have better customer service. Next, we waited another 7 to 10 minutes for our server (I believe her name to be Rebekah). She was impatient and quite rude off the top. We ordered our drinks and she was off. During that time, the manager who spoke to us earlier, told her of our extended wait and her attitude suddenly changed, mainly to please her boss more than the customer. We ordered, my wife's meal came out as a kid's order. They made a new order for us to take home. We ate, celebrated my wife's birthday and vowed we would not return. Poor, poor customer service for a place I liked. Yes, a place like this gets packed, especially when local sports are playing, but each customer that walks through those doors should be treated well. I should have stiffed them on the tip, but I did not. A horrible experience.",

I have found the food to always be good, although they sometimes run out of things (ahi or crab cakes in particular).  I do think it's a bit expensive, but I really have to knock down a star as service is so erratic.  Had great service the other night.  But the visit prior, we left before ordering, after a good 10 minutes with no one to take a drink order.  The best part, the hostLess who took her time in seating us while she finished her personal conversation, thanked us for coming in as we walked out.  I guess they didn't hire her for her brain.",

We were going to eat inside but it was crowded with a high decibel background.  No one was sitting outside so we sat down to see if it was tolerable.  The U.S. Open Golf Tournament from beautiful Torrey Pines was on so we grabbed a couple of comfy chairs near the misters close to the large HD screen.  We ordered cold ones and the Spinach Appetizer with flat bread.  It hit the spot while watching Tiger come from behind to finish first for the day with one day to go.  It was so comfy we then shared a fresh summer salad with strawberries and candied walnuts or pecans (either one or the other).    Next time it is hot (which is until October) check out the efficient misting system at the Yard House.  There's a lot of cold drink choices...",

I'm not suppose to like this Yard House because 1) it's located in the chichi, pretentious mall better known as Scottsdale Fashion Square and 2) the patrons are mostly chichi, pretentious folks who shop at the chichi, pretentious mall. But seriously, if you're jonesing for some beer and grub and the need to watch a few of the Sweet Sixteen match-ups, there's no better place than the Yard House.  From 3-6 every day, they have Happy Hour with $3.25 pints (they claim to have over 200 types of beer) and half priced appetizers. The best thing is that you don't even need to sit at the bar to enjoy this deal.  The only beef I had with this place was our waiter who insisted on calling us \"girls.\" \"Hey girls, how are you doing?\" \"Hey girls, what are you having today?\" But as that was followed up with, \"Hey girls, I'll need to see some ID,\" I guess he's not so bad.",

I mean, what can one expect from a corny chain, where one is overwhelmed by Disney-fied cake and ale?  This place couldn't be less lame if they renamed it Chotchkie's and served Extreme Fajitas.  Actually, I'm shocked that they don't.  Okay, okay.  I like beer.  They've got it.  But where is their sincerity?  They couldn't give a squirt of piss that they are serving rare Belgian pilsner.  I'm supposed to feel okay about this?  I need authenticity when I'm at a bar.  This is why so many Ultras in Scottsdale or LA or wherever fail with me, the dearth of convincing clientele, staff, and moreover, product.  Don't shit on my pillow and tell me its a little piece of chocolate.  Overall, this is a genuine 1-star rating ... not one of those mealy-mouthed \"oh, i wanted to give it LESS but I couldn't!\" reviews.  Go grab a beer here, but don't expect anything more than a bridled time with the fancypants of Fashion Square Mall.    P.S. One time I saw a guy valet his yellow Testerossa here and got out like he ran shit ... until minutes later the exact same model pulled into the valet area right behind him.  Ha!  Nice rental, watermelon balls.",

I shed a little tear each time I walk by the keg refrigerator and see the hundreds of kegs of beer in there.  It's just so beautiful.  Some I've never heard of, some I can't pronounce, yet others leave me scratching my head as to why they are even on the menu.  Why, with all of these great beers out there, would you have PBR on draft?  But I digest...  The food here is better than average with a large variety to choose from.  As far as food options go for happy hour, this place takes the cake.  It seems like half of their menu is on special during happy hour, all for a very good price as well, which is nice because the food here is a bit pricey.  You could honestly make a meal out of some of their appetizers, which stand out from the rest of the menu.  Great sliders, good wings, and a huge seared ahi sashimi plate.  The rest of your menu is your standard pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and so forth, with a few notable exceptions:  jerk chicken with shrimp stack and the mac & cheese are wonderful.  If you are not full from the beer, they have some of the better desserts that I have seen.  There are plenty of large screen TVs here for catching the game, and some pretty good music piped in all the time.  Service can be a bit slow, especially when it is busy, but the servers know a lot about the beer and can easily recommend something new to you based on what you typically drink and like.  They do have a full bar, but I think they should reserve the right to throw you out of the place if you order some foo-foo cocktail at a place with some of the best beers out there.

As we talk  the subject of Yard House henceforth referred to as Yardstick comes up. I have heard of this mythical place but as I live in Northern California and the ones in CA are in Southern California I had never been. A friend mentioned that Yardstick was in Scottsdale and I jump out of my seat and ask why I had wasted my whole vacation without going to this one.   My friend who also has a love of all things beer said that we should leave the fire and go. After extinguishing the fire (safety first kids). We were off.  I was impressed with the restaurant it was fairly new and had a big open feel to it. Their beer list also included 100+ choices.  Which brought a smile to my face.   After removing all the beers I have had on the menu I was left with about 57 choices. I spent a few moments figuring out what I wanted. I went with a Dunkel. A good choice.  The rest of the night went well. I ordered a French Dip and it was pretty good. The rest of my beers were good too. Although a bit on the pricey side.   One of my biggest problems was our waitress kept forgetting to place our orders for beer and since the place wasn't packed we had to wait longer for beers. If we weren't waiting for beers we were waiting to place orders for beers. After being told she had forgot to bring a round that was ordered she did give us two free beers which was nice.  I'd go back to Yardstick again simply because I like beer a lot and do like their selection.",

Since it is all about the beers, I went along and ordered my ballpark standby, Fat Tire in a pint glass.  It was the perfect drink for a warm day.    The food menu was good too. We settled on chicken nachos and watched some sports.  Then all of a sudden, I started to pay attention to the music, it's all the best classic rock.

I've become somewhat of a beer snob. I also admire a place that proffers variety, building on the boring ol' domestics that many people seem to enjoy (don't ask me how).   The Yard House is where I went to drown my sorrows. After a hard day at the office, I wanted a beer. And I wanted a good one at that. My friend and I scurried over to Yard House to partake. I even tried a Honey Ale (from another Oregon Brewery) and chatted up my friend who enjoyed her pilsner and ale.   The menu has good happy hour selections. The service is just alright. Weird, I'd say, meeting several jaded and bitter bartenders. Ours was not too shy about broadcasting his \"woe is me\" stance to us. He turned out to be a Cancer. Figures. In any case, he served us beer, even if he seemed a bit impatient when we were debating on what to order for our last round. I stuck with the tried and True - the Hazelnut Brown. My friend went with her fave, Blue Moon.   There was no frenzy to kick us out, even after happy hour passed. The bartenders poured us generous amounts of water... and even seemed to be a bit flirtatious with us. Could have been my non-sober imagination, though. We ordered a couple aps - the poke and crab cakes. They were okay. A bit hard to eat, I'll admit. Never in my life would I imagine seeing a $12 Spicy Tuna Roll on any menu, but the Yard House makes no bones about it. If you want sushi, you'll have to pay a hefty price for it. Then again, sushi at a bar like this? You're better off ordering the spicy thai chicken pizza. I hear it's really good.  Inside, the Yard House looks and feels like a typical restaurant/bar. Sure, you see alot of beer selection when you mosey up to the bar, but nothing really wowed me about this place. If I could give it 5 stars just for the variety of beer it has, I would. BUT I happen to think a little thing called \"atmosphere\" is important, too. That's why you'll find me elsewhere, like at The Lost Leaf, where I can partake of my fave Rogue ale, as well as many others, including Hobgoblin from the UK.",

Large place with lots of space to handle heavy volume. I've seen this place look pretty busy on the weekends. They have TV's playing all the sports, so this would be a good place to see the game.  I'm on a low carb diet so I couldn't eat everything, but here are some comments from my friends. The apps were pretty good. They liked the truffle fries, hummus, spinach artichoke dip, and fried cheese curds. One of the guys is vegan and was very impressed with the vegan options and the taste of the dish he ordered. Others preferred burgers and they had nothing but good things to say about them. I personally ordered the kale salad in the picture. It was very good. I think I would have liked a little more dressing on it. The skirt steak was tender and cooked to order. The other time I ordered the same salad with salmon. The salmon piece was kind of small but it was cooked well.  Lunch would take about an hour so it was about right since we had to get back to work.

The place is really huge and as you enter there is a bar in the center, regular table seating around and some high chair seating too. It's an open kitchen, and looks neat. The place on a Friday is crowded but the service is quick.   We ordered some watermelon margarita and they were really good. The watermelon was not too sweet just had the right flavor and it was delicious.   We ordered quite a lot of appetizers queso dip(great dip, lots of cheese, little heavy but tasty), chicken nachos( this was the only disappointment, qty is pretty good and the cheese dried up, there was more of nachos compared to the dipping), onion ring tower (the best onion ring I have had, crispy, tasty and great presentation, the dipping served with it was delicious), firecracker wings( wonderful, perfect sauce and spice), fried Mac and cheese was alright.   We ordered spicy jambalaya with angel hair pasta and trust me this is the best dish in Yard house. This dish my new favorite and the main reason this place gets a 5 star. The pasta was cooked to perfect and Cajun cream sauce melted the pasta in the mouth after a bite. The shrimp and crawfish perfectly cooked, absorbed all the ingredients. Chicken andouille was a little salty but I can ignore it coz the dish deserves all the praises. I can rave more on this amazing entree.   Since it was a bday celebration, we got some free dessert and do save some space for their mini peach apple cobbler, it was warm, delicious and the topping with icecream a perfection. Mini chocolate souffle cake was great too but preferred the cobbler.   Overall a great place and great food. Price is definitely on the higher side, would suggest to go during happy hours.",

The staff were all friendly from beg to end. The food was good with decent variety and selection. We ordered 2 apps - the fried Mac n cheese which was super good with 6 pieces it worked perfectly with our party of 4. Also got the cheese curds which I thought were just okay , a little overdone. I ordered the Nashville spicy chicken dinner which was delicious, spicy and a hefty portion with the side of sweet potato pancakes (interesting). The only bad part of the night was 3 of our 4 meals were brought out way before the 4th dinner came out. My husband complained and 2 different people from mgmt came to apologize. I would come back here even with that snafu. The food and service were all good!",

That being said not everyone likes the amount of acid I like.  Fish tacos were good, but I'm kind of getting over \"street taco\" sized tortillas.",

    "text": "Stopped by while shopping at Fashion Square Mall for an app and a beer. The beer selection here is huge and the beer menu is divided into different styles of beer so it is easy to find a style of beer you like. Good selection of hoppy IPAs (one of my favorite styles). We share an order of Poki nachos (it was happy hour and the order was 1/2 price). The nachos consisted of marinated raw tuna, fresh avocado, cilantro, serrano chile, green onions, nori, sesame seeds, sweet soy, sriracha aioli, and white truffle sauce over crispy wontons. The cost of a huge plate of nachos with a very generous portion of tuna was $6.72. My daughter had turned 21 earlier in the week and the server noticed that in her driver's license so she brought her a birthday dessert---a molten chocolate cake with ice cream. My daughter said the cake was delicious---must have been because she finished it all even though she said she was full after the nachos. Fun place to visit with solid food and good service. One of our go to places while we are in Scottsdale. Generally, we just visit for the beer but this time ordered food too and it was good.",

My friend and I sat at the bar and were greeted by Tiffany. Good personality, very attentive.   We started with a clam chowder, good, but a bit too salty. My friend ordered the Halibut with Porcini mushroom sauce...a real exquisiteness!! I wish I ordered that too. Unfortunately my ginger crusted salmon was too salty as well.   We ended with the banana and blueberry cobbler. I'm not a big fan of cobbler but this one was to remember. They also have a good selection of draft beers, to try samples next time!   Concluding, it's an almost 5 star review, too bad for those salty dishes.",

We tried Yard House (happy hour on Saturday is only reverse aka late night).  My aunt wanted us to cheers with an alcoholic beverage for the successful shopping excursion. I left my wallet in the car and tried to order a drink from the server and she kindly apologized that she couldn't without my id (I'm 26 by the way). The manager stopped by and even offered to pay for my drink if I went to get my id she was incredibly sweet and professional about it. I respect their rule of id'ing anyone who looks under 35.  Their chop salad is yummy! It doesn't come with romaine so our server was kind enough to let us know and give the option to add it.  The Brussels sprouts appetizer is delicious. Sweet potato fries are just okay.",

    "text": "Hello Yelp Fans:  I am writing about a visit to the Yard House.  Following represents our experience:    Beverages:  House wines are so-so.  If you have a refined palette, I don't recommend you order the generic house wine.  There was a good selection of beers - better choice for the money.  Appetizers:  We tried the calamari, the pita and spinach dip, and the firecracker chicken.  The calamari was very chewy.  I would not order this again.   The pita chips were nice and crispy and just a touch of salt and the spinach dip was nice and thick.  Some spinach dips can have too much mayo in them.  This was nicely done.   The firecracker chicken nuggets were a hit - they were nice and spicy, not dry, and actually could be eaten as an entree if ordered with a side of fried rice.    Salad:  We ordered one house salad with ranch dressing and a caesar salad.  Both were served with the lettuce warm/room temperature and the plates were also warm.  The croutons on the caesar salad were soggy.  Neither salads were anything special.  We did not eat the salads, not worth the calories/effort to eat warm lettuce.  I would not  recommend ordering.   Entrees:  The salmon and quinoa was a nice portion, but the salmon was a little dry.  It comes with a sauce, with the sauce (if you like the type of sauce served with it) made it less dry, but I feel any fish should stand alone regarding how it was cooked to maintain moisture (and not need a sauce).   The ribs were \"okay\" nothing special, not a lot of meat on them, a little chewy.  The length of the rack was appropriate, but I would not recommend ordering them.       Desserts:  We ordered the banana brulee and one of the apple cobbler with ice cream.   The brulee was warm and soupy - would not recommend to order.  Flavor was not heightened by the bananas on the top which were brown in color and not from being torched, just brown. The top of the brulee was NOT nice and crispy, no evidence of sugar on top and a torch used to brown it.   The apple cobbler was very mediocre.  The ice cream was almost totally melted when it was served to us.  It was nothing special, save your money.         Noise:  The noise level was high.  We could hardly hear the people at the end of the table for only eight people.    Service:  Service was good, except we were never offered fresh black pepper on our salads and we had to ask for our water glass to be filled (that should be obvious).    I hope this review is helpful to you!",

A more timely manner will ensure better money in the long run.",

We were also told that there was a large party, so we may have to wait for our order, which we understood.  The waitress quickly takes our order.  Around forty minutes later, the waitress returns and reminds us that there is a large party and our order may be delayed.  We get a little suspicious.  The waitress had forgotten to put our order in!!!!    But it gets better.   After another fifteen minutes, our order arrives, but it is not what we ordered.  The manager comes by and apologizes and comps our meal.  At least we did not have to pay.  I had the small portion of vegetarian angel hair pasta, which was pretty small.

However, my heart swells with joy when I think about all the vegetarian options available at Yard House.   I wish more restaurants would follow suit and use meat analogues like Gardein or Quorn. It's so refreshing to have a large selection to choose from instead of a veggie burger or portobello sandwich. I'm at a bar; I want buffalo wings, dammit!  Thankfully, their awesome veggie buffalo wings are on the happy hour menu. My sister and I split an order, we each got two drinks, and our bill was only $26!  When you're organizing a large group, it's hard to find a place that will please everyone. Many of my acquaintances are fearful of ethnic food and/or independent restaurants so often I have to surrender and eat at a boring chain restaurant. Now Yard House will always be my first choice.",

We had a party of 13 but only had 10 seats at our table reservations were made 4 days in advance for a bday party. The only 5 star thing was my cherry limeade drink. Who ever made it made it the best I ever had. Would I return probably not due to so many other options in a 5 mile radius.",

    "text": "This review is for 07/16/2011. After leaving the Well, I had to eat up before the Arizona Diamondbacks vs Los Angeles Dodgers game at Chase Field. On my previous visit to Scottsdale, I drove by the Fashion Square Mall a couple times, but I never got to visit. With the help of Yelp, I found the Yard House.  I arrived around 12:30 to a nice part of the Fashion Square Mall. I don't know the exact location of the Yard House, but I know its around the valet service that the mall provides. The location where the Yard House felt like I was in Las Vegas, but it seemed that way. This Yard House vibe was excellent.   I walked in and sat at the bar since I was alone. I was greeted by Steve and ordered a Cape Cod ($8.75 each) right of the bat. Yeah, I love my Cape Cods. Steve used Ketel One Vodka ($8.25) with Cranberry ($0.50). I can't believe they had to break the price down on my receipt. I was very hungry and I got ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken ($16.95).   The wait for the food was about ten minutes. It is my second time to ever be at Yard House and I am still surprised to see so many drinks served on tap, but a lot of the drinks were sold out and had to be served by can. I finished my Cape Cod and ordered another one. Too much for one day?  My food came and I, immediately, smelled the mushrooms. No, not that those mushrooms. The chicken was very crusty, but the sauce definitely complimented the crusted chicken like it was butta. Awesomely delicious. Steve had to take a break and I had a female bartender. We stroke a small conversation and Steve came back. Sorry about that....I was starting to have fun with the talk. My total came out to be $37.54.  I had to go in and out fast to get ready to get to Chase Field, but with my stressful morning and celebrating at a dive bar to eating at a restaurant, half of my day came out to be just a perfect morning. Glad that this place was next to my hotel, but like an Angeleno, I drove instead of walk.",

I am absolutely addicted to the Gardein Veggie Buffalo Wings. Beyond amazing. The tofu lettuce wraps are delish as well.  I'm really glad to see major restaurants catering to all sorts of dietary varieties versus leaving us veggies with the option of a side salad or plain pasta!  Chances are you will see me here at least once per week with a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and two orders of the Buffalo Veggie Wings ... sometimes twice... so if you have been waiting for that perfect moment to make contact with me, well, I suggest you hang around YH each night about 530.",

After eating and enjoying my 2nd glass of wine, the waitress came over to our table and dumped a tray with a couple glasses of water or something!  Broke glasses, etc., both my friend and a got pretty drenched.   We both had to get extra napkins to dry ourselves off along with our purses and shoes.   It was the worst I have ever been \"spilled on\" in my life.  We walked outside a couple times just to try and help dry our clothes off.    Management would only take off one glass of wine for each of us.   It was ridiculous!   Not that we were trying to get everything comped, but they could have taken our beverages off the bill.  Won't be back there anytime soon.  We had to leave our seats just so they could sweep up the broken glass and mop up all the liquid.  What a joke.  A really good restaurant would have comped everything, we had split a meal, so our tab wasn't that much....their loss.",

Great service, yummy drinks, tasty food and lots of choices...ugh, now a thing of the past I guess.  Our office ordered Yard House through Delicious Deliveries for our sales meeting and it was absolutely awful. I ordered the mac & cheese and if I didn't know any better, I would say that the food was cooked last week.  It wasn't even on par with next-day leftovers. The noodles were weirdly chewy, the smell was uninviting (how do you make garlic smell bad??!), I don't think there was any cheese, the bacon was squishy, there was some large grey-toned pieces in it and I'm still not sure if it was meat or if it was some weird looking mushroom thingy. If I didn't know any better, I would think that this was some sort of prank, but I don't see Ashton Kutcher anywhere and we are two weeks past the statute of limitations on pulling an April Fool's goof.   Not impressed and not ordering it again.",

It also helps to have a server be knowledgable so you can pin point what type of beer you might like. I ended up getting the Leinenkugel's sunset wheat. It tasted like fruity pebbles! I found the food to be a little pricey. I would suggest to come here during happy hour. We had just missed happy hour, so we shared a small pizza and a salad and the bill came out to almost $50 with 2 beers. Also, I love the music that plays here. Overall, it's a nice fun place to eat, drink, and dance in your chair.",

They ask that you pay first. They won't do this if you sit in a booth or at a table. But in a hardly-anyone-there-at-ten-on-a-Saturday-night:  hand over a credit card or pre-pay? Nobody. I mean nobody in Scottsdale that even resembles a classy place does this. I'm not talking about The Mint crazy bar scene where it is reasonable to ask for the plastic to start a drink tab. Not even Denny's asks for cash first before food delivery. Idiotic. Also, lots of TVs but don't get too caught up in one thing because they like their soccer in there and they will change the channels without warning. The good sport you might be watching can easily turn into mostly bright green pixels with shirtless and  knee-grabbing Euros trying to score what would be about the third goal ever successfully made in the history of that sport. Want a great sports bar, one mile away? Go to Zipps on Camelback. Down to earth, friendly, great food and easily 2/3 the price of the Out House.",

Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack).  In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words. Heck. Yes.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere. Unbeatable beer selection. Service was lackluster at the bar but better out on the patio.   It was Saturday afternoon, a little after 3 and this place was virtually empty with the exception of the patio which didn't have a free table available. We wanted to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous so we decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for one to open up. The beer selection is great which can make it a little difficult for an indecisive person to pick just one. After much thought and analysis of the beer menu, I decided not to drink since I was suffering from a cold but my boyfriend chose a local brew which he ended up being quite fond of. After 30 minutes we noticed that there were a few tables open outside so my b.f. went back to the hostess to find out what was going on. She said that she paged our little buzzer a while ago but had figured we had left. Mmmm..hello, we were sitting at the bar where we told you we would be...why wouldn't you come and tell us a table was available? Anyway, after that little blip we closed out the bar tab and moved outside.   Service outside was better than at the bar which was surprising. After the bar tender took my bf's drink order he wasn't seen again. Another bartender had to close out the tab and refill my water for me. I believe his name was Jay - he was very friendly so I recommend him if you can grab him at the bar.   The food was good given that it's a sports bar. I liked the fact that there were vegetarian options outside of your typical salad or a veggie burger. They also list which items may still contain animal products for those vegans out there. I opted for the lunch special of a small pizza and salad. The salad was a mix of fresh spring greens tossed in a balsamic dressing - AMAZING. I could have just eaten the salad. I had the BBQ chicken pizza which was tasty but could have used some more sauce. Oh yeah, we also had the chips and guac snack plate to start off with - REALLY good guacamole here which was another shocker. I highly recommend it but be warned, it does have a little kick to it.",

Every other time i have been here there service has been amazing.   Last time i went there i had a million special instructions on my meal and felt like a jerk but I am trying to eat meat so I needed to substitute a few things. The server was amazingly accommodating and came back to check if I could have different items since they had meat stock or to inform me of different things just for my order at least 3 times. If i were serving the table i would have been annoyed but he had a smile and was genuinely nice every time he came to the table.   I can honestly say that i have NEVER ordered something that i didn't like at this place. They have a huge selection of food to pick from and offer everything from Chinese to Mexican to amazing deserts.   The restaurant itself is very clean and well maintained and I have never had a problem with parking literally there are like 3 parking garages within a 100 foot radius of the restaurant plus they almost always have valet available.   Great place, great food, great service!",

They are very very accomidating though, so if they screw up they will do it over for you or take it off the bill. They also have tons of beers on tap. If you like beer - it's a great place to go.   They recently removed a bunch of bench seating in favor of tables and chairs... I wasn't a fan of them doing so, but it's no big deal... it just means it's now more likely to see other people there. Before, it was easier to just eat your meal with your friends in isolation - now it's more open and you have to be subjected to the douchebaggery that huddles around the bar.  It has become a bit of a hangout for the snottsdale crowd it seems. No big deal really - if you like that, you can hang out there and be seen. If you're not into it, at least you can check out a few fake boobs while you down a pint of fancy imported beer.  If you like beer, but hate this atmosphere - head south a bit to Papago Brewery.   Yardhouse gets my approval only because of the food and comfortable booths and great beer selection and accomidating service.",

Also they have probably the most impressive beer selection in town.  Not the best beers always, but the biggest spread.  its a good place to listen to top 40 classic rock or see a game when you have a hundred bucks to blow.  This is my \"special occasion\" place.  my only beef with Yardhouse is they claim to be a rock n roll bar but all you need is a billboard chart on shuffle to match their knowledge on the subject.  Think upscale Hard Rock Cafe minus any redeeming memorabilia.  Attire was typically business casual, which i didnt know when i showed up in my ragged jeans and black flag t-shirt.  Oops.",

I always go to the location at Scottsdale Fashions Square - usually to meet family & friends before a great shoppping excursion. We make a point to have lunch here. I absolutley LOVE the Chicken Tortilla soup! I always order a cup of soup and a small salad and I'm never disappointed. The soup has HUGE chunks of chicken in a lightly spicy & creamy sauce that will keep you coming back. I love that they top the soup with chunks of avacado, tortilla chips and cheese.I guess I really don't need the salad because the soup is so filling, but I have to get my greens! The service has always been great.  My friends and family have tried other dishes as well and have always had a favorable review. They have many alcoholic beverage choices and something to please everybody. I would higly recommend theYardhouse!",

Totally available, even ahead of what you needed.  The food was the problem.  The Hawaiian was ok I have tasted a lot of better burgers even Carl's Jr's Hawaiian is better.  It really didn't seem like a \"Real burger\"  I only ate only 1/2 my burger.  when I reheated my left overs at home.  I notice one thing I hope nobody goes through.  the hamburger had some type of filler in it. (when you heat up a burger it stays together not fall apart into pieces)  This burger feel completely apart it was very odd. When eating a hamburger I expect there to be more meat than filler and for it to stay together not fall apart.   This was my first time visiting the Yard House.  I may try it again but I will NOT order any hamburgers if this is how they make them.  ********I have to change the rating from a 2 to a 4 because a Yard House got a hold of me and was interested in my story.  I was going back to work,   things were crazy to say the least and then I moved out of state.   They listened to my concerns and wanted to make a change my impression about them and they did a great job.",

The food is overpriced in my opinion, but its good.  Here is my contention: why get a steak at Yardhouse when the metropolitan grill is less than a football field away? Why get fish when Kona grill is next door? Why get a pizza when Ztejas is a short walk? So, why get anything but a burger at Yardhouse? Their menu is all over the place. Jambaliya at Yardhouse? Common.  This is a good place to hit happy hour and grab a game. And, they do have a good happy hour with half price app's. Keep your food orders to the basics----sliders, chicken wings and such which will contain your food bill.  Service is good. At least it wasn't Johnny tackle box or Jenny etch-a-sketch serving me this time. Parking can be a hassle at Scottsdale fashion square.",

    "text": "DON'T EXPECT TO USE A DARDEN GIFT CARD AT YARD HOUSE!!!!!  My sister is a Manager at a Darden restaurant and has worked for Darden Restaurants for many years.  For Christmas 2012 she gave us a gift card to the Darden Restaurant she works for.  When she gave us the gift card she said to use it at one of the NICER Darden restaurants like Yard House.  So tonight my boyfriend and I decided to go to Yard House for drinks and dinner as we figured we had a gift card so we might as well.  After racking up $80 plus dollars on our tab we presented our gift card.  The bartender (who by the way was awesome, as were all of the bartenders that night) politely told us that there was going to be some issues with our gift card but he would get a manager.  A few minutes later the Manager came over and said, \"Sorry, we can't accept this.\"  I was very confused as while I was waiting for him to come over, I had googled 'Darden Restaurants' and one of the logos was the black oval with the Yard House logo in the middle.  Also, on the back of the gift card it said it would be accepted at any Darden Restaurant (clearly not this one).  He then, very rudely, attempted to explain to me that even though they were Darden he wouldn't be able to accept it until June or July.  He also told me his paychecks said Darden but they weren't fully a Darden Restaurant (he offered that one up without me asking).  He said it would take about 14 minutes for him to \"go in back and get the authorization\" that my card had the necessary funds on it.  After again trying to explain my confusion that I was at a Darden restaurant yet they would not take a Darden gift card, I asked what he was going to do for me during my 14 minute inconvenience wait, he said, \"ma'am, I'm going to accept your gift card.\"  As if he was doing me a favor.  After about 9 minutes he came back and said he had everything he needed and then he took our CC to pay the $22 difference.  After he was done charging us for the $22 I had to ask 3 times for the original balance of our check to know what to tip the bartenders and finally he was able to provide that.  He then attempted to \"apologize\" and tell me that his instructions from Corporate were that whenever someone came in with a gift card from a different Darden restaurant they were instructed to request a different form of payment.  Keep in mind he never said that to us, he just stated t could not accept our gift card, very rudely.    I work for a Company who has made all of their money based on Customer Service.  All I know is Yard House and Darden in general has a lot to learn from this HORRIBLE experience.",

    "text": "One of my idols is vegan Chef and New York Times Bestselling cookbook author Tal Ronnen. Tal was recently involved in the launch of 25 new vegetarian and vegan options at The Yardhouse restaurant, which utilize Gardein (plant-based lean meat products). I got a text from my friend asking me if I would want to go to dinner with him and Tal, who was in town for work. I wrote him back and said that I was a big fan of Tal's and would be honored to join them for dinner. I didn't see the exact vegan options on the Yardhouse menu online, but I apparently didn't click on the right link for AZ printable menu, which shows all the available Gardein options. As I was looking over the menu, I was so impressed with the variety of menu items available-from appetizers, to salads, to burgers and entrees. Tal suggested that we order a few items, so that we could sample a variety of plates. We ordered a chopped salad, onion rings, veggie beef sliders, veggie BBQ chicken pizza (for our non-vegan friends), veggie chicken rice bowl and veggie orange peel chicken. If you are vegan and you order the veggie beef sliders, just make sure you order them dry. Everything I tried was super delicious and flavorful. I know that I will be back 10,000 times in the future because it is a place I can go with my non-vegan friends and not sacrifice on my vegan options. I found out tonight that chef for the Yardhouse in LA took over 6 months to find the perfect pickle to accompany the veggie beef sliders...guess a good pickle is hard to come by! If you have an opportunity to eat at The Yardhouse, please support their vegetarian and vegan options. I can honestly say you will love them!  Here are the vegetarian and vegan menu options available nationwide at The Yardhouse:  Veggie Items Made With gardeinTM (gardeinTM is a chicken or beef substitute made from soy, wheat, pea proteins, vegetables and ancient grains)  *Veggie Boneless Wings buffalo | firecracker | jerk 10.55  *Veggie Fried Chicken Strips fries, maple dijon & ranch 9.65  *Veggie Beef Sliders classic or bearnaise served with fries & pickle 10.45 (vegetarian off the menu, could ask for no sauce or cheese to make vegan) *Veggie Thai Chicken Noodle Salad egg noodles, grilled chicken, spicy peanut vinaigrette & broccoli-carrot-sprout-cabbage-cilantro slaw 13.85 (vegetarian-could modify to vegan possibly) *Veggie BBQ Chicken Salad avocado, pasilla, corn, jack, tortilla strips, tomato, pinto beans, citrus bbq, fried onions, cilantro & chipotle ranch 13.95 (vegetarian-could modify to vegan without cheese) *Veggie Chicken Caesar Salad grilled, breaded or blackened, hearts of romaine, parmesan crisps, croutons egg free caesar dressing 12.85 (vegetarian-could modify to vegan without parmesan crisps) *Veggie Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza firecracker sauce, mozzarella, macadamia nuts, carrots, green onion & cilantro 12.75 (vegetarian-could modify to vegan without cheese) *Veggie BBQ Chicken Pizza mozzarella, cilantro, red onion, smoked gouda & bbq sauce 12.75 (vegetarian-could modify to vegan without cheese) *Veggie Chicken &amp; Avocado Sandwich swiss, lettuce, tomato & mayo on poppy seed onion bun 11.65 (vegetarian) *Veggie Spicy Chicken Sandwich grilled with blackening spices, cheddar, jack, cabbage & cajun aioli on cheese flat bread 10.95 (vegetarian-could modify to vegan without cheese) *Veggie Chicken Rice Bowl bok choy, baby corn, snap peas, carrots, shiitake, celery, peppers, broccoli & jasmine or brown rice 12.85  *Veggie Penne with Chicken crimini mushrooms, asparagus & sun-dried tomatoes tossed in marsala cream sauce, dusted with parmesan 15.95 (vegetarian-could modify to vegan without the cream sauce) *Veggie Chicken Enchilada Stack pasilla peppers, garlic cream, jack cheese, corn tortillas, pinto beans, tomatillo, red chili sauce & sour cream 15.85  (vegetarian-could modify to vegan without the cream or cheese) *Veggie Orange Peel Chicken crispy chicken breast pieces, baby corn & bok choy in spicy sweet orange glaze with jasmine or brown rice 16.85  *Veggie (Mac + Cheese)2 chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta & truffle oil 16.25 (vegetarian...probably not easily veganized.

We ordered two apps and two drinks. While our drinks and my food came out quickly, his wings were taking an unusual amount of time. I was so impressed when the manager came out to apologize sincerely, and explain why they were taking so long. He brought them out as soon as they were ready and took them off our bill, again apologizing and making sure we had everything we needed. As a former server, I understand things happen but it really makes a difference when the staff go the extra mile!!! I will, of course, be returning :-)",

    "text": "Updated Review:::: I gave this place a second chance! After being over my previous experience I visited them five times. All the other times I attended were great! Management must of done something to fix the issues. They were clean at all times, all the people were friendly, we received our food in time, no hassle. I hope this continues to be the case going forward and I shall continue to return.   Awful customer service! Why is there a Gratitude included in the bill? I would have left $0.00 as a tip. My friends and I came to enjoy great food and drinks needless to say nothing about the experience was great not even the drinks. We came in 8pm an hour went by and I still hadn't gotten my food so I asked the waiter what was going on? Obviously he had forgotten about it. It wasn't until 9:30 that I received my food and I got to speak with the manager. Thanks for taking care of my appetizer I would have given you two stars, but everyone else got charged extra for food and drinks. Their bathrooms were disgusting and no pens to sign off my tab with????? Seriously never coming back again!!!",

My date also loved his chicken noodle soup. the pineapple mule was good but you have to love pineapple. It wasn't super sweet which was nice. Thanks yard house!!! Will be back",

    "text": "Is this place some kind of joke?? I wish I could say LOL at the end of that..  This review is a little past the time that we came in to this restaurant. We came in probably around 2 months ago, I just always forget to write this review, but I feel it's necessary. My fiance' and I still talk and compare about this experience when we are at other restaurants.  We came in after shopping one day, were sat in a booth and our server throughout the experience was very friendly and kind, so he's definitely not part of this review. The mixed drinks have a splash of alcohol in them, I'm almost certain. I would know this because for 1) I have worked in the industry, I know how this works. 2) I am a drinker, and I literally had 5 drinks and felt nothing. Now, my desire to drink \"a lot\" of alcohol that night was obviously my choice, but DAMN, if I'm ordering 5 mixed drinks I sure as hell better feel some kind of buzz..??? I normally do. Not to mention how expensive the drinks are. Do these bartenders forget the alcohol? Are they free- pouring and just not pouring hardly any alcohol and hope that no one notices?? I had martinis by the way.  On to the food.. it would have been \"OK\" if they came out hot. Everything was luke warm at best, and nothing more than mediocre. Once again, if this were a restaurant that was cheap then it wouldn't have been a big deal. But for the price?? No thanks.  We laugh about this experience because we've been to fine dining restaurants before and ordered appetizers, drinks, entrees, AND dessert, and the bill has come out to less or about the same. Either serve drinks with ALCOHOL like they should be and get your food up to par or lower your prices. Ridiculous and dishonest. We will never be back",

    "text": "The holiday season will soon be upon us, and that means one thing. Shopping for the ones you love.  Matching the right gift to that special someone is always a challenge, but it doesn't need to be. Not anymore. May I suggest the Yard House at Fashion Square?  Start your shopping here with some of Yard House's spectacular IPA flights, enough to insure you're buzzing like a high-voltage power line. Now it's time to get started with that shopping.  Take the short stroll to the information booth inside the mall, its just a few short steps away from the Yard House. This is where they sell gift certificates redeemable at any of the Fashion Square shops.  Next, inquire that the clerk run your card through the thingy to see what its limit is. Once you know the available limit, your judgment, sufficiently impaired from pre-shopping activities, will allow you to throw caution to the wind as you go balls on your loved ones. This is how I never fail to match the right gift with that special someone. But here's where it gets tricky. DO NOT max out the card.  I suggest leaving at least a hundred on it for your immediate return to the Yard House, where you''ll find refuge from all your holiday shopping madness.  Once safely at the Yard House, finish off your holiday spree with another couple rounds and some delicious chicken wings, again, being prudent to not max out the card.  Leave at least twenty bucks for the cab ride home.  PS. If possible, don't go shopping the same day as your wife. This will allow you to safely sneak out the house with HER Visa card.",

    "text": "I love the food, drink selection, and atmosphere of the Yard house.  I could rate it 5-stars on those criteria alone, but location and food do not a restaurant make.  There are two issues with the service:  The first is that the restaurant can get uncomfortably packed at times, especially nights and weekends.  Using the bathroom can occasionally be a nightmare, as you might get stuck 1/2 way.  This feels like partly a layout issue, partly a flow issue, and partly a hosting issue.  The restaurant needs to open up some space on the bathroom side.  Servers and food runners need to establish guidelines on how to move through it without obstructing it constantly, and hosts need to ensure parties sat there are the appropriate size and not adding chairs to the ends of tables (this happens often, I wouldn't be mentioning it if it just happened 1-2x).    The second issue seems to be turnover related.  I'm good at remembering people, even those I barely interact with.  I know the restaurant industry is famous for this, but when I was going there frequently I almost never saw the same staff member twice.  It's possible there's a massive staff, I suppose - but how many bartenders can there be, a dozen?  I used to go for a drink before a movie once a week, and I honestly never saw the same bartender twice.  This is coupled with their staff occasionally flubbing the menu.  Either calling something by a different name, not clarifying, etc. this has twice resulted in the wrong thing coming to the table, which I promptly send back.  Maybe it's a new-menu-too-often deal, too much turnover, I can't say.  But it happens too often for it to just be a one-off/unlucky customer kind of deal.  Edit - I noticed this establishment has a $$ rating.  In my opinion, this is probably a little under noted.  Some of these dishes, the ones including seafood or other exotic ingredients, can easily run up your bill quickly.  It's worth it, but the $$ can be a little deceiving, it should really be 2.5 $'s (if that's possible).",

Well, I just eat food at happy hour so I won't be able to comment as much about the drinks.  I do like the pomegranate mojito though but I don't think it's on the happy hour menu.  I ordered the onion ring tower. Yum. So much foodddd - share it, share it, share it! It's pretty good. Some people who doesn't like onion rings really like this one.   The poke on the happy hour is good too.  Ahi crunchy (the salad) is delicious as well, the tuna is fresh and I love the freshness of the veggies and the sweet/sour of the dressing. I want more of it!  Yardhouse is the perfect place to come to enjoy beer on tap and watch a sporting game or just hang out with friends. It has a casual, fun, sporty atmosphere and the wait staff does their best to be accommodating as well. Great for large groups!  ...free Wi-Fi as well!!!!  Note: Not bad for a chain restaurant, not bad....(nodding head in approval)",

The lighting is VERY dark, and based on the music, this place isn't geared toward the 20somethings. So it was funny when my whole table took out their iPhones and used their flashlights to peruse the menu! At one point, the waitress held someone's phone so my companion could hold the menu at a particular angle. Fun stuff. Huge menu and selection of food that came out VERY quickly. Loved my Southern fried chicken but loved even more the mashed taters/spinach/corn concoction.  Selected the trio sampler for dessert and was pleased with the yummy and unique selection. The lemon souffle rocks.",

The patio was sort of outside of where cars were getting valet parking. Might be a bit noisy for others but hey, not bad to check out fancy cars. :) After a long walk, we decided to come here for the happy hour and man was it worth it. We started it off with two half yards, one ECLIPSE (Blue Moon & Guinness) and one Guinness. We thought we weren't going to finish it but it made us feel hungry so we got some appetizers on their happy hour menu. The  Hawaiian Poke Stack was yummy, that is if you can eat raw sushi. It looks like a burger but they stack it with poke and use fried won-ton strips to separate the poke, avocados and ginger. I think they mixed the poke with some soy sauce and sesame oil. It was good. Then we got Seared Ahi Sashimi. (yes, we are into our sushi rawness) Small portion, theres maybe about 5 slices at most, and some greens on the side. Not bad. I think it is only worth it for happy hour price.   Appettizers happy hour price - Seared Ahi Sashimi (reg: $11.95) $5.95 - Hawaiian Poke Stack (reg: $12.95) - $6.50  Drinks  Happy Hour (half yards) -$7-$10 -  ECLIPSE (Blue Moon & Guinness) - Guinness  Check out the website. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yardhouse.com%2Fhappyhour%2FDefault.aspx&s=61aa215088fc28c77a6dbba5d537dd28c51e53443d49d797a2fd80ef6d27e570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yardhouse.com/happyhour/...</a>  course I would go to yard house again, for the happy hour :)",

They offer you truffle, sweet potato or garlic besides the regular fries but be advised that is a $1 up charge. Beer selection is good but also overpriced.

Can't really go wrong here. If you are looking for a good whisky to try that isn't too expensive, I recommend Buffalo Trace! It's from the same company as Pappy's!",

I've been told the Giant California Roll is great, but cannot have it because of my gluten allergy. The service was okay, we had some issues getting clean silverware.  The food was satisfactory, not my best meal ever, but not my worst either.   They did have TV's throughout the dining room which is great to watch some football and not have to be in the bar.",

Incredible service!  3 orders of wings for a party of 12. Korean, Firecracker & Buffalo.  All excellent!  EVERY burger ordered was cooked to perfection just the way they were requested. Kudos to the cooks! The Lamb Burger & Truffle Fries are a \"MUST Have here\"!   Fantastic selection of beers, over 130 Taps! Lots of mix drinks options too!  Vegetarian dishes are offered along with over 100 meal choices makes it suitable for large parties or as intimate for two!  This location has treated us great every time we've dined here.  They are trained well!   I want to thank the entire staff \"again\" for making my sons Birthday so memorable!  See you soon:)",

    "text": "My coworkers and I like to talk about food. We got on the topic of cheese curds one day, where I was taught the importance of breaded vs battered (battered is better!) and also where the best cheese curds in the Valley are. I was told that Yard House has good cheese curds, but was a bit expensive. When my family came into town and wanted to get American, it felt like the perfect moment. \"Why not Yard House?\"  We went on a Saturday for lunch. I hadn't looked at the menu beforehand, and thought the prices were a bit high; however, I was happily surprised to hear that the lunch combos were available daily. We ordered cheese curds (of course) to share, and my coworkers were right. The cheese curds were GOOOD. I especially loved the honey hot sauce that came with it, though my parents found the horseradish aioli the bigger star. Just thinking about them right now is making me hungry.   I got the shiitake garlic noodles with a kale caesar salad. Though the flavor was nice, the noodles were overcooked and seemed like they sat out for a while, because they were slightly congealed. The caesar had good textures and a nice lightness to it. My dad and brother got burgers, which they were also unimpressed by. All in all, a pretty average experience.",

No worries, though, because while Nicole A. needed manager Simon's assistance from time to time, she still remained friendly, upbeat, and positive, and served up good vibes the entire time!    After the usual questions regarding my most common allergies, I decided on ordering the Spinach Dip and Margherita Pizza, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=x4wwwCcZ6KrR3fugBRSf6A&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> half-priced during HH, and the new Mayan Mule, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h7txU1EsWwm_2kCMPAm-CQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> made with ginger beer made in-house, with manager subbing soda water for the corn syrup-laden ginger ale, minus the strawberry skewer (yep, strawberry allergy, too).  Simon was able to steer me away from the Onion Ring stack (corn syrup in the beer batter) and two of the Mini-Dessert Trio (the Chocolate Souffle Cake and Apple Crumble both come with ice cream that contain corn syrup!).  Next time, I know to try the Fried Mac n Cheese WITHOUT the porcini cream sauce, which usually comes on the side.  All three of my selections were delicious!  Loved the salty and creamy spinach dip, and the crunchy parmesan-topped fried pita crisps that accompanied the app made it so much fun to eat! <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YmiR5j64Y8Y4N9Ave9iXfQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Simon came around and asked how the food items were, and I said they were both great, with the pizza not being as crispy as I'd liked, but still great, and he offered to have it crisped a little more.  OK!  Awesome service from both server Nicole and manager Simon-- thank you!!  LOVED seeing the caloric counts in almost every menu item!  (Alcohol beverages, with the exception of beers, had caloric counts.)",

I've had the soup here before and it was spot on. My wife had the cheese burger and my son had the chicken quesadilla.   The lamb burger is an excellent choice as well. It was served on a lightly toasted bun  with feta cheese on top of a bed of arugula.  The lobster noodles are a great choice as well. I had this dish on my previous visits.",

You don't really see it right off the street (Camelback or Goldwater). It's basically connected to the mall.  In terms of selection Yard House has one of the best Happy Hours around. Between appetizers AND pizzas they have about 20 or so items to choose from that are half price (I believe it's from 3 to 6). And it's not a special HH menu w/smaller portions. It's the actual menu items that are pretty good size. I didn't realize this when we came the last time and split 5 things between 3 people and it was WAY too much food.   They have a lot of standard things on the menu and it's all good, but one thing I will say that's a bit different and stands out are the poke nachos. I LOVE nachos and the twist here is yummy. Basically it's poke instead of the standard chicken or beef & wonton noodles instead of tortilla chips. Then it's a lot of sushi type garnishes. It's delicious.   The beer selection is very good here as well and they're a couple bucks off during HH. If you dare those HUGE beers they serve are four dollars off during HH.",

Legit and comfortable seating arrangements where I can interact with people on the other side of the couch.  For a place that has a chic minimalist ora, they can totally upgrade to a better wine selection lol but i would def come back to enjoy a classy unwinding happy hour after a long week of hard",

    "text": "Or my first time at the Years house and not my first time at this location, but the menus has changed a bit. Host staff was great and the server was very nice and helpful.   I didn't give a full 5 stars for the reason that they got rid of a large variety of drinks. I started off asking if they had Ciroc vodka and they didn't, which is understandable as not many bars have t. But when I asked for shiner bock, fat tire, Murphy's stout and for each beer I asked I got s \"NO, we don't have it\", that kind of was disappointing.   I ordered the fish and chips with sweet potatoes fries and it was as always delicious. Will definitely come back for the food.",

    "text": "The Yard house has been a primary meeting location for me around the valley.  I'm not sure why?  As I'm writing and revising I realize why.  All locations have prime real estate at malls - so there is immediate availability for pre and post activities.  This Scottsdale establishment has the best location I think.    Blackened Swordfish Taco and Baja Fish Tacos I recall being decent.  However, I have sent back a seafood entre plate (Phoenix) - I don't think its on the menu anymore, had a bad shrimp appetizer (Scottsdale) and some of the Tacos weren't that great for me (Glendale).  Burgers are ok.  I have eaten here a lot and really nothing amazing unfortunately?  Hmmm.  Your taste may be completely different than mine.  So this is not a great food review for the Yard...  Its been a good meeting place.  I'm not reviewing the drinks though I've spent many hours at the bar with company.  Bartenders have been decent, food service has been decent.  Some people really seem to like the drink selection.  Ladies have told me this is not a good date place - so just a heads up on that lol.",

    "text": "I can't say enough good things, about the Yard House, at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I visited, with a friend, on Cinco de Mayo.  An odd choice, for what is essentially a \"fiesta-type-party?\"  Not if you had read (and seen) their promo email, which touted the El Picante margarita (complete with a video, showing the how it's made).  That, coupled with a description of their Vampire Taco, sold me.  They do not disappoint, on any level. Cheerfully greeted by Mixologist Sal, I told him that I wanted to see him make the El Picante.  He did an excellent job, withholding only the \"firing\" of the jalapeno garnish, explaining that those are all done, ahead of time, as a safety precaution. A manager even came out, to further explain, citing the proximity of several very flammable substances, behind the bar.  Understood; safety first. The drink is first rate, just a tad too sweet, for me, with the agave, but Sal remedied that, on the second go-round.  The Vampire taco is delicious - one of the best I've had, anywhere - and management substituted a corn tortilla, for me, so I could stay GF.  They are most accomodating, to say the least - very genial hosts. My friend (who is not a fan of anything spicy at all) was absolutely satisfied, with his Roast beef dip.  The sandwich came with a substantial portion of French Fries, which were the best I've had in ages.  I don't usually eat potatoes but these were way too good, to pass up.  All in all, a terrific experience and we can't wait to go back. If you haven't tried this place, what are you waiting for/  You're in for a treat.",

Didn't order food......The amount of taps they had was pretty outstanding. I usually jump from beer to beer, but they had Dogfish Head 90 minute on tap, so I stuck with that.  My friend, a die hard Jager drinker, orders doubles at a time, my girl, martini's.  Now being we are drinkers, and not cheap drinkers either you would think our table would get a bit more attention from our waitress in a empty restaurant on a Wed night.  NO.....we had to flag her down EVERY TIME to get a drink, many times her walking right past our table. We weren't a bunch of obnoxious frat boys.....3 people having expensive cocktails catching up.  We had to FLAG her down to get water as well.......pfffffftttt.   I had my rating at 3 stars but after reading this I knocked it down a star because I'm ticked off again because of our experience.",

The hostess seemed bothered and annoyed that god forbid we have more people to come in and spend money.  My apologies sweet heart!   Ordered drinks first and after 15 minutes of just sitting there I got up and found a \"manager\".  I wanted to enlighten him on the wait so far just for drinks.  He looked at me with the most puzzled look on his face and said these exact words \" I am sure they will be out soon\"  I guess 15 minute wait was acceptable for him. Drinks finally showed up and after the long wait, Paige our waitress informs my girlfriend they do not have the type of beer she ordered.  She then just asked for a Blue Moon.  Wow! just wow!  I got out of my seat and went to bar to buy the blue moon myself.  This is ridiculous!   The table ordered appetizers which included Calamari, wings, some sort of spinach dip.  It all came out at the same time, Great right? Maybe now we can just let the rough start go.  Apps were dropped off and everyone looks around like \"who's going to eat calamari with their fingers?\" No app plates were brought and everyone just had to scoop the food with there hands since there were no plates to serve our selves.    I am usually not one to write such bad reviews.(look at my past reviews) but this place was absolutely ridiculous!",

Austin ordered a huge beer, and we split a pizza with french onion soup.  The food was tasty, and we both walked away satisfied.  What also impressed me was the staff.  We were always getting checked on by someone, weather it was a server, the manager, or the bus boy taking our plates.  Yard house also has a lot of TV's for your viewing pleasure.  Ample space to sit and watch, weather its at the bar, table or booth.  Open space, with lots of elbow room.  No one's sitting on top of each other.  Love it!

My boyfriend and I each had really great veggie burgers (I got a classic one, he got a fancier themed one and said it was good) and a ton of French fries. The food is pricey, but it tastes like it is worth the quality.   Here's where they lost stars: 1, the inside of the restaurant smelled like something I can't even describe. Like sewage, but worse. I don't know if they were having a plumbing issue the day we went or what. If there hadn't been an outdoor table available we would not have stayed. 2, we had a waitress who was training another girl, and they were not the most efficient team. We had two servers, you'd think at least one of them would have remembered a side we ordered or brought us our check without us having to ask for it after they cleared the plates and seemed to forget us. I know training can be difficult, but they seemed to be slowing each other down.   I'd go back, but I would sit outside again (just in case) and pray to the restaurant gods for a solo veteran server.",

Same deal with the onion ring tower, good pieces of onion the ONLY issue some rings were crispy and the batter stuck to them others were soggy and when taking a bite you get a mouth full of onion. All in all still tasty.",

This time, my server couldn't stop boasting about the chicken tortilla soup. My previous experiences with chicken tortilla soup was in a hospital and I don't feel I need to go into further detail about the quality of THAT particular soup. I honestly didn't want to have anything get in the way of my wine consumption but she was so convincing that a finally caved.   I got a little cup and it was packed with extra goodies- tortilla chips, avocado, onion, tomato and fresh ground black pepper. My first impression was where has this been my entire life!! It was screaming with thick and creamy flavor that I inhaled it in probably 2 seconds. The tortilla strips were so fresh and not soggy which added just the perfect little crunch. If I could fill a mini inflatable pool with this stuff and just live in it, I would.",

The atmosphere is as I stated industrial and sterile, the food is average at best, and quite pricey. A standout however is the Kalbi Short Ribs, they are actually quite tasty. The beer is the star attraction here, and the selection is vast, so there is sure to be something for everyone in that list somewhere. You can do a flight of four if you are undecided, or like me and you want to try new beers you haven't had. There are also 8oz, 10oz, 16oz, and 32oz sizes available on most beers. Overall it's not a bad place to stop for a beer or two, especially if you are shopping at the mall! So definitely stop in and give the place a try, especially if you are a Beer Lover!",

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I were recently invited to join a group of my co-workers for a Saturday evening get together. Fortunately, the group coordinator chose this restaurant, which was a new one for us.  The Plot: We started out by sharing an order of Chicken Nachos. That was followed by two entrees, including a Margherita Pizza and a Baja Shrimp Taco combo (two shrimp tacos, rice, and beans). Everything was so good that we decided we just had to share a Peach Apple Cobbler for dessert.  The Scene: The layout of this establishment was nice in that there was plenty of room, there were TVs everywhere, and we never had to raise our voices in order to hear each other talk.  The overall quality and taste of the nachos was average for good gastropub food. However, the portion size was huge and plenty for all of us to share.  The pizza, overall, was light and tasty, the crust and seasoning was very good, and the toppings were fresh.  The item that stood out the most were the shrimp tacos, which were loaded with goodies and nicely seasoned.  My fiancee thoroughly enjoyed the Peach Apple Cobbler, which was a lovely and satisfying way to conclude our meal.  The Rest of the Story: The service was prompt and friendly, my beverage was refilled twice without my having to even think about it, and the prices were on par with what you'd expect at a location like this.  Epilogue: My fiancee was very pleased with her meal, recommended a four-star rating for our review, and has expressed her desire to return sometime soon.  Photo Design By: Bille Z.",

There's always going to be something really good, and you are not just limited to the typical steak, chicken and fish options here, especially with a nice size list of veg options.  The service here, as at every YH is very professional. Always friendly and helpful. The employees here certainly earn their pay!

It felt like they ran out of cheese so instead they improvised and gave me a spinach dip. I've had this appetizers several times, so trust me when I say it had zero cheese.

Having said that, two of the people in our party, who had identical cocktails, asked for them to be remade.  The waiter, probably just doing his job, said the drink would be made exactly the same way, which seemed odd to me as a guy who bar tended for over 15 years, but it got worse. The waiter asked the bartender and the bartender agreed, the drink is what it is. No attempt to fix it for either one was made. On top of that, we waited over 10 minutes for our bill at midnight on a sloooow Friday night this past weekend. Surprisingly enough when the bill did arrive, it was separated and gratuity was included on all tabs. That is a real gamble. I have never seen it done when the service was good, only when it was marginal or worse. After 15+years in the industry, I would say, maybe it was a bad night....but I am apprehensive about a return visit.",

    "text": "Happy Hour Review Only  Met up with some friends here for half price appetizers and discount drinks before the Giants/Cubs game on a Thursday evening.  Between four of us we split 2 orders of chicken nachos (extra cheese), 2 orders of sliders, calamari, and the poki tuna stack.  My favorite by far was the poki stack with this kick ass soy/wasabi dressing circling the plate which will clear your sinuses in no time.  The nachos and sliders are my friends' favorites.  They were okay, nothing special.  Calamari was not all that special either, bread crumb crust with marinara instead of battered with aioli.  I do however, highly recommend the $4.50 margaritas, big and tasty.  With all that food and two drinks each the bill came out to $20 a person. We left stufffed and still probably spent less money than we would have on ball park food.  Our server was chipper and accomodating even timing our last round for right at the 6pm happy hour cut off buzzer.  I would definitely go back again for happy hour, I don't think I would want to pay the regular prices after all that.",

It looks very modern and hip which matches the surrounding fancy mall very well. It is an actual nice restaurant and not just a bar making it an appropriate place to bring children. The type of atmosphere they are aiming for, the prices and selections of food remind me a lot of a BJ's Restaurant. The portions are generous but unfortunately, the food I had didn't really impress me.",

    "text": "The yard house, where to start on this pretentious place.... Oh i know i will start from the bartender. OK so me and a few friends went here for a few drinks, and maybe to talk to some ladies or possibly trannys, my friend Sean is all into that, and i say don't knock it till u try it! Anyway we sat at the bar and waited for our list of beers, when all of a sudden a man/pedophile crept out of the shadows gliding towards us l, as if he was wearing heelies or he was a fucking vampire!! He was very creepy and was wearing a trench coat and a strap on, this guy was fucking creepier than Willam Defoe and IT(Pennywise) the clown combined!! I am almost 90% sure this guys is on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FAmberAlert.com&s=374f1440853a1dde57fc82def1bf57ef5d3d84b4cdcb3588cada2fc55c3136cb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">AmberAlert.com</a>, so he crept up to us and was like what can i get u guys...perhaps a beer, appetizer, or maybe a sacrificial virgin!! lightning struck at that very moment as my friends and i screamed like we just saw a picture of Al Roker's vagina!! We tried to keep it cool because we didn't want to end up in a dog kennel in the back of this guys van. I ordered the greatness which was Great white coastal stout and Guinness, it was pretty good but for 8 bucks it wasn't that good. My friends ordered some fucking daiquiris or some fruity shit like that cause they're a bunch of pussies. We were thinking about getting another drink and the bartender rose out of the ground as if he had an elevator shoot him out of the darkest depths of hell!! I asked him what type of beer he liked and he said, \"whatever makes an 8 year old girl pass out the fastest.\" I looked over at my friend and said, \"they serve colt 45??\" I ordered a Black and tan cause fuck it you cant go wrong with that...WRONG, my beer was completely flat and warm, so i asked the candy man for a new drink. He told me the beer was supposed to be flat so that way u can drink it faster, and right then i knew....i had been roofied!! He winked at me and started to laugh so sadistically that the walls were crumbling and people were fleeing the bar like it was 9/11!! He pulled out a 2 foot machete and licked the blade and said....\"Can i get u guys any appetizers??\" I said i think were just gonna get a booth, he replied, \"ahhhh the bar is way better, you can see all the kids eating with there parents from this view, and its easy to slip roofies in their beers from here. I shook off the world's scariest comment, and me and my friends grabbed a table. We looked at the menu for appetizers,  and i was gonna pass on the food, looked a little over priced. My friend ordered the coconut shrimp and my other friend ordered the spicy Asian glazed wings. When the food arrived my friend got 3 little shrimp over a pile of vegan diarrhea, for about 14 bucks. My friends wings looked pretty good, i tried one and they were alright nothing special, like my beautiful baby Tender Greens! We stuck around and tormented our waitress like the bartender taught us, we got the bill it was pretty fucking expensive for a round of drinks and 2 appetizers, but whatever my friends are rich assholes so they paid....I mean rich sweethearts ; ) as we were leaving the bartender flipped downwards from the ceiling like a vampire and said, \" hope u guys have a .....lucky night!!\" we said, trembling with fear, alright cya.....he replied, \"oh...you will.....you will\", and let out the loudest creepiest laugh like at the end of predator. The next day my friends went missing and the only evidence that was left of them was a compt receipt from a bartender ...who never existed!",

It's in the mall. This was my second time (Indian Wells) and my friends first time. I told him that he was going to be in for a treat with the beer selection. Lo and behold they have over a 100 beers on DRAFT! It was a bit overwhelming so it took us almost 10 minutes to decide what drink to order. I got the Oregon honey and he got the half & half. Both of us were not disappointed. We ended up ordering several appetizers We got the sliders (ok, too much bread, not enough meat & side of fries), crab cakes (2 pieces, average tasting),  lettuce wraps (grounded chicken with tofu, tasty), & the ahi tuna (unusually served as a round pie, good and super filling). This ended up being more than enough food for two people. It didn't stop there, though. We ordered the trio sample for dessert. We couldn't resist. It consisted of a small ramican of lemon souffle (yumm), chocolate fudge (yummier), and apple cobbler (heavenly). Overall, the service and food left us with a good stuffed feeling. I would definitely stop by and try it again. Unfortunately, we don't have one in the Bay Area. Wait, maybe that's a good thing?",

Yes, we get it, you LOVE the beer samples but I am pretty sure your job does not end once you convince us to try them. 2. He forgot our sweet potato fries. Since they were not on the menu I asked if they had them, he said yes. So, it was not that he did not hear the order. Granted we all make mistakes, but there was no apology.  3. The fries were comped... good thing too since they were the greasiest and most burnt sweet potato fries ever encountered. Oh and I must not forget, they came with a mysterious piece of something gross fried with them. YUCK! 4. If everyone loves your tomato bisque and you even have a grilled cheese and tomato bisque menu item, you should probably make LOTS of it on December 26. You know, if you are located in a mall full of people returning their Christmas gifts..... JUST A THOUGHT 5. So you have tons of beer on tap, but really so do other places. Lucky for the rest of us, these other places also try to have good service.  Won't be back....Unless I have a craving for nasty fries and suspicious fried \"blobs\". DOUBTFUL",

To start out the meal, we sat at our booth for 10 minutes before being greeted by a waiter and his \"trainee\".  Then after another 10 minutes we were asked if we wanted an appetizer, etc.  We ordered the hummus, but 10 minutes later the waiter came back to say that they were out....but they had some kind of hummus fusion thing we could try.....uh no thanks!  So instead we opted for the chicken fingers.....GROSS!!!!  It took me 2 big bites to realize that the chicken wasn't cooked and still pink and gooey inside......BLAH!  When we flagged someone down, a girl this time, she told us that she would remake the chicken and take care of whatever else we needed that day.  Obviously I don't want undercooked chicken twice so we told them to skip the chicken.  That was the last I ever saw of that girl and her \"whatever we needed speech\".  I order the Turkey Melt.....which was horrid, #1 it was cold (I don't understand how a melt is cold....but who knows maybe the melter was broken that day), #2 the turkey was old (it tasted like the turkey that has been in your fridge for a week and a half and you don't know if you should eat it or not...), #3 the bread was soggy and #4 the fries were cold.  My boyfriend ordered the sliders......now when you think of sliders you think \"oh, how cute 4 mini hamburgers\"....but what you get is a thin little cheeseburger (with NO TOPPINGS i might add) that has been CUT INTO 4 PIECES......why the heck would I order sliders if I wanted a cheeseburger cut apart....I would have ordered the cheeseburger, actually gotten toppings, and paid less!  Are you kidding me?  We also asked for ranch dressing and the waiter brought me some weird white chunky sauce......BLAH!  Since when does ranch have chunks?  Overall, this was TERRIBLE and to top it off we never got what \"we needed\" like that random girl said.  We had to pay for the entire meal which came to about $60.  Seriously?!?!?!  Thanks for taking my money and giving me an upset stomach.  Don't eat here.",

Now I understand during happy hour when the place is full and the bar is hopping, it'll take a few minutes to get service.

I think it's hard to find places that are consistently average, but even harder to find places that are consistently slightly above average, well above average, or, hardest of all to find, consistently great. I like the fact that Yard House is consistent.. the fact that they're consistently slightly above average is even better.  Last night I had the BBQ Chicken Salad, which I thought was pretty good, and worth the price. It was definitely a man-sized salad, as I couldn't even finish the whole thing! I thought the salad was over-dressed...but that's pretty common. I don't think people generally understand what a properly dressed salad is. What's funny is that if you ask for \"light dressing\" at most restaurants you usually get a salad that is close to properly dressed. (Sorry for the tangent discussion on properly dressed salads.. one of my pet peeves.)  If I were to order this salad again (I probably will), I'd make sure to ask for light dressing.  I love the music at the Yard House - usually classic rock. I actually heard a song I liked and had to pull out my iPhone to Shazam it. Sometimes the music can get overbearingly loud if you're trying to carry on a conversation, but more often than not I don't find the volume to be an issue.  Wait staff is clean & well-groomed. Staff in general is friendly. Silverware and dishes are clean. Food (that I've eaten) seems to be average to above average quality.  I keep going back, so clearly I'm a fan.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place, I mean their slogan is \"Great Food, Classic Rock, World's Largest Selection of Draft Beer,\" what more can a girl ask for? I have to say the food was good, the music selection was awesome, and they did have an extremely large beer menu. I had the Stella Artois, which was delicious, but at $6.00 a glass I limited myself to two (I am a poor college student after all). The fish and chips was also surprisingly delicious, but a tad pricey at $15.00, although their fries were really good. The restaurant was very spacious, and nicer than I expected. The service was kinda slow, but I was with a group of fourteen. I would definitely like to come back here and try some more of the beers, that is when I have a little more money.",

    "text": "Yes I am a fan of this particular Yard House at Desert Ridge. Let me tell you why....first of all the staff is friendly and ready to help. The decor is casual with lots of large screen tvs without being over the top sports bar. There is a center bar with tables surrounding it and large booths along the walls. Seating is plentiful with outdoor seating also. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone. Along those lines, the beer selection is amazing. Try the tasting the beer sampler. We narrowed our orders down to the appetizer size of Korean Beef Taco and a Hawaiian Poke Stack to start. The taco was a small flour tortilla topped with marinated grilled beef, Asian slaw and a spicy DELICIOUS sauce. The Hawaiian Poke Stack was visually beautiful. Sushi grade Ahi cubed and sprinkled lightly with black sesame seeds topped with a layer of Asian slaw then a crispy wonton, finally slices of avocado and ANOTHER pile of ahi with a few sprouts. All this surrounded by a soy/wasabi sauce. Yes, it was fantastic. For entrees, we selected the Lunch Pairing of Margherita pizza/spicy house salad and an Ahi Crunch salad. This place knows how to do salads....Mixed greens with shredded carrots, perfectly steamed broccoli, a few crunchy wonton chips, sprouts and a wonderful spicy salad dressing. We were really impressed with the quality of the sushi grade Ahi...We also decided to try the \"Eclipse\" beer which was a Blue Moon Pale Ale with a float of Guinness on top. Yup, we are fans. I'm going to try the Porcini crusted Halibut next time. Just GO!",

The keg room is really interesting, but S.P. nailed it on the head-- nothing here is exactly memorable. The food is good, the beer is cool, the atmosphere is so-so. I can't say anything bad about this place, really, but I can't say anything great either. Maybe if I went back at happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6pm or Thurs 10-close) and got cheap beer and half-priced appetizers I would feel different as they were, in my book, pretty overpriced.",

If you catch a glance at the beer room teeming with flowing kegs of delicious import and microbrewed beer, it could make your taste buds water as it does mine.  Unfortunately, beyond beer, the Yard House doesn't have much to offer. The food is average at best and is way more expensive than the quality justifies.   It, along with its neighbors at Kona and Z Tejas, have built-in the additional \"scene premium\" that make a five dollar chicken finger appetizer suddenly worth eight or nine.   The service is actually very friendly and knowledgeable, so it is a fine place to grab a beer en route to somewhere else, but I wouldn't go out of my way to overpay for average food. That's just me.",

I recommend the delicious baked macaroni and cheese and the martinis are excellent. However, the service at the bar is lacking. I've been to Yard House a few times over the last couple of months (I'm usually dragged here because my friends love the place and I  cave in because I don't want to be difficult) and the bartenders -- one guy in particular -- are extremely snooty. The last thing I want when I go into a bar is getting the holier than thou attitude from my bartender and that's all I get when we sit at the bar here. If you want good food and drinks, this is a good place to go, just be sure to sit far, far away from the bar. The wait staff is much more pleasant.",

I spoke with her on the phone and explained the situation and she was very kind and understanding. A few days ago, I received a Yard House gift card in the mail from her... now that is what I call customer service! I am not usually one to complain in order to get free meals but I feel that they needed to know there was a problem and she reassured me that they would work on it. So, I am sure our bad experience was a fluke (hopefully) and we will be returning to use our gift card :)",

The only problem?  Atmosphere.  It seems like the owners of the Yard House got together and decided to make a bar/restaurant for the Scottsdale crowd.  Noble plan, right?  So they listed all the attributes of a cool bar: lots of options, a signature element (more beers on tap than anyone in Pho-town), beautiful people, roomy booths and patio seating.    It all comes across as pretty good, but there's nothing that really makes this place memorable.  It's actually like going to a mall versus going to your favorite little funky thrift store.  All the right elements are there, but some bit of soul hs been drained out, which is actually my critique of Scottsdale more generally.    So if you're looking for a random beer or some bar food while shopping at the mall, the Yard House is the place to go.  But it's basically forgettable.",

    "text": "My friends and I eat out a lot so saying this was the worst dining experience I've ever had is really saying something. The evening starts out with me washing my hands before we are seated in a vomit filled sink. When my friend went to the bathroom about an hour later the sink was still filled with vomit. When the bartender was informed of sink vomit he chose to stare daggers at my friend as he walked away and then stand there staring out our table as if we had thrown up in his sink at his studio apartment. Obviously the staring became disrespectful and management became involved. The bartender told the manager that we were shouting obscenities at other patrons which was totally False. There were maybe 5 other tables with people seated at them, it was a very dead night. We had no interaction with anyone but staff. Juan our waiter was great he did his best to smooth the situation out but obviously it was time to leave. We all paid cash and one of my friends handed the bill to the manager personally. We left but felt we had been treated unfairly. One of my party called the restaurant to speak to whomever was running the show to complain. She took down his info and then informed him that we had skipped out on our bill and that they would be following up on this!! Not only did we not skip out on our bill but we had left a generous tip for Juan because as I had said he was very nice. Long story short if you like vomit, bartenders that will stare you down for no reason and then lie about you, management that will steal your money and threaten legal action for something you didn't do then go to the yard house in Scottsdale. Also the food is nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "Corporate blandness redeemed by many vegetarian options.  With a name like yard house and the huge beer selection one might overlook the food here on first thought as I did. I was wrangled to go here on a triple date.   On first glance at the menu I saw the usual burgers, salads and sandwiches one would expect. But I also saw a section called Gardein, which has menu faux chicken veggie items. From faux wings, rice bowls, pizzas and salads all with fake Gardein chicken.  WE started with two orders of the Gardein wings $9.95 each. One order buffalo and one Jerk. The jerk ones were a bit bland but had a nice fried crust to them so they were satisfying. The Buffalo ones were a bit soggy from the sauce but overall a nice app.  For my main I selected the Ahi Tuna Sandwich 13.95 Seared very rare. It comes with a pencil holder of thin fries. The fries were good but a bit cool when they arrived, not the freshest. The Tuna was nicely rare and a pink color as it was not a the best sashimi grade. All together it did not work as the caramelized onions and Swiss over powered the tuna. Dismantle the sandwich, eat the tuna with soy and then the bread with the cheese, tomato, spinach alone and it works as two good mains.   My date had the Gardein rice bowl, (11.95)  the name is apt as it was mostly rice, with a generic soy based sauce, and mixed veggies. It was decent and nice it was on the menu but not gourmet, it needed some spice and less rice more vegies.   I also did like the fact they had a local seasonal beer on tap (4 peaks pumpkin porter)  It was also nice they could split an app 3 ways with no issue at all. So bring in a group and paying will not be the usual headache.",

Although not on the happy hour menu the duck wings are awesome. You get 5 and they are quite filling since duck has a higher fat content than chicken.  Just took my son here today.

My last visit, my boyfriend and I got these:  Pomegranate Margarita  $7.25- Alright, they put sugar instead of salt on the edge  Fried Chicken Strips  $4.92 - Good, but not amazing  Wyder Pear Cider  $4.50 - So delicious!   All my girlfriends and I always order this when we come here.  It's so cold and fresh due to coming from tap  Spicy Tuna Roll  $6.42 - My top favorite item here.  It's no ordinary roll, it's basically a spicy tuna cake that is covered in a layer of avocado with cucumber, beans, and carrots and the tuna is marinated with a special sauce.  All my girlfriends and I who are big sushi eaters love this dish as it makes a big twist on a spicy tuna roll  This place can also be great for a date as they the lighting is dimming and when there is those awkward silences, you can watch the several tv's throughout the place and talk about that. ;)   Afterwards, you can walk around the mall as it is connected to fashion square.",

The fish and chips with truffle fries was flavorless, the penne pasta was over cooked, the bbq chicken salad was decent but nothing special the French dip sandwich has rubbery roast beef and was inedible. The avocado spread on the turkey clus was brown and the chicken sandwiches with avocado also contained brownish avocado and rubbery chicken. All in all a large disappointment out of all the food the only good thing we had was onion rings and even they were overly greasy. Not a place I would order from again nor would I recommend to a friend",

Let's be honest, she looks upset and seems to not even want to work there. She knows she can quit, right? It appears she dislikes what she does and just overall brings a harsh/unpersonall/sour tone to those she serves. She seriously never even looks at the guest when she talks, as if the guests are bothering her. I would not come to this yard house bar when she is working.  However, the hosts and other restaurant staff were very generous, courteous, and basically just did their job at making all guests feel welcome (appreciating business)",

The calamari is simple okay. Their draft beer choice is awesome. They even had my husband's favorite, orange blossom by papago.",

We had a server who was training a guy named Tom, the trainee was great. The only downside was that they were not quick to refill drinks, even after my grandpa specifically asked for consistent refills because his jambalaya was so smokin' hot. Otherwise, great time, great menu, and Tom the Trainee-- you rock!  Also: There is a super tall bartender who is amazing. On the night I found out I am mildly gluten intolerant, I went in for dinner, sat at the bar with friends and he was so attentive to us and so helpful with me for ordering a gluten free meal and beer. He also took such good care of my friends and I, even though we were probably giggly and obnoxious because we were excited to shop for Vegas. Thanks again!",

The beer selection (both on tap and by the bottle) is incredibly impressive, and the list of appetizers is almost as long (not really, but you get my point).  I like coming here, because there are loads of flat screen TVs hanging out throughout the restaurant tuned to all the different channels you'd want to watch at a bar, I never get bored with the menu, and the service is reliable.  The service isn't outstanding, but that's okay.  Last time I was here, I shared the chicken nachos and lettuce wraps with friends.  The chicken nachos were a little short on the chicken, the chips were just a little too soggy, but I'd probably still have them again because of the substantial size of the plate and the tasty guacamole.  The lettuce wraps were just right.",

It is really confusing getting there when looking at GPS. You kind of already have to know where this place is to go there. Whichever, we found it.  I had the spicy chicken breast sandwich. It was really good. My french fries were cold when they came out. A bit disappointing for how pricey a sandwich is. I told my server and he ran straight back and got me some hot fries. My girlfriend had the chicken tortilla soup. I tried a bite. Oh, the flavors in this were amazing. So good. She also had an asada street taco. Smallest taco with the biggest price! It was too spicy for her until she took the peppers off. But otherwise, she thought it was pretty tasty.  The beer, oh the beer. I love beer. The beer menu and the beers on tap is the amazing part of this place. Over 130 beers on tap! Love it. I was feeling fruity so I tried a Four Peaks Arizona Peach and a Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Bluberry. Both were very good. My girlfriend got a House Honey Blonde and a House Belgian Amber Tripel. Both of those were delicious as well. That is the best part of this place.  They did have sports going on, but I'm not into basketball, so that didn't do it for me at the moment. Maybe if it was some hockey going, I would have been into staying longer.  The service was excellent. Our server was always there asking if we needed anything else. Totally on top of it.  Too highly priced. A sandwich and 2 beers for over $30 with tip is too rich for my blood. I'm sure I will visit again. It was a pleasant experience. Great beers, good food and great service, just way too expensive.",

    "text": "3.5 stars would be more accurate for my experience.  My business partner and I had a late dinner and a beer here last night.  There beer selection is second to none (or at least second to very few).  There are not many places that you are going to be able to find Dogfish Head 90 IPA on tap.  My 90 minute was great, good head on the beer.  No issues at all there.  I had the pastrami sandwich and french onion soup.  I am a bit of a fanatic about french onion soup.  I would give their an average to a little above average rating.  The broth/base of the soup was not all the thick but the crouton, onion and cheese were all done well to make up for some what the broth/base was lacking.  My sandwich was good but really nothing more than average.  The pickled jalapenos did give the sandwich a nice kick though.    I had only had only been to Yard House once before for lunch and would go back more often if I still lived in the area.    All in all I think Yard House stands out a great spot to get some beers/drinks but the food is a little above average.  I guess that is about what is to be expected when the draw is the massive beer selection.  I would definitely eat there again, just don't see me making a point of it.",

I spotted a couple of menu items that I thought might work.  We were warmly greeted, and seated in Brett's area. Brett was able to bring out the manager and the chef to talk to me. With the chef's recommendation, it only took a couple of minutes to decide on what would work and how he could alter it for me. My husband was able to have his Happy Hour menu and I got to have something that worked for me.  I have had to ask for the chef in other restaurants, with unsympathetic results or they made no attempt to make the food taste good. This one I made the effort to review because they all went out of their way to take care of me.",

Our group and two other groups were the only ones there so I have no idea how the waiter missed my order. I ordered artichoke dip and chips, the waiter asked me if I wanted it to be served when everyone else got their food just because it's an appetizer. I said yes and everyone's food came out except mine. I waited for a bit then my bf told me to ask the waiter. I asked the waiter about my order and he said he will check the kitchen. Minutes past and no answer, I asked another waiter to check what happen to my order. He went to the kitchen came back and told me that the order was lost and my food will be done soon even though everyone was almost done with theirs. I didn't want to make a scene because it was my friend's birthday and I didn't want to ruin her dinner even though she was annoyed with the staff. My food finally arrived and it wasn't artichoke dip it was a whole steamed artichoke. I told the waiter I didn't order this and he offered to take it back. I told him no because I was starving. I ate it, it was good but not as filling as the dip would been but they did give it to me for free! I just wished my experience was better.",

Sunday - Thursday The Yard House has a reverse happy hour from 10 - close. This was music to our ears!  After settling into a patio table , we ordered the Hawaiian flat bread pizza and chicken lettuce wraps, both of which were half-price. Having drank all day at the Diamondbacks game, I opted out of a beer - however my friend ordered the Four Peaks peach. I think it is safe to say she like it when she was giggling 2 glasses later! The food came out in a timely manner and both the pizza and warps were to die for! 9 times out of 10 we leave with a to go container, however last night was the exception as we couldn't stop eating! Our entire bill with the pizza, chicken wraps and 2 beers was only $23 with tip!   Late night snacks will now be a tradition after Coyotes games and concerts!",

The first time i went i got the bbq burger, i was not a fan, but the beers and appetizers made me come back for more. My second time i got the crispy ahi tuna salad. The dressing was greak the fish tasted as fresh as it can in arizona. The service is great my sister fell hard on a wet floor and we got our meal free and they did everything to make sure she was okay and didnt need to go to the hospital. The only reason they aren't getting a 5-star is that when you sit on the patio you get less attention and the servers do have a kind of \"do not want to be here\" attitude. Love it though and will go back.",

I don't know too much about beer, but when I see a menu of 10 pages devoted strictly for beer...legit is all I must say. Very tasty beer, and a +1 for having my fav beer, Guinness, in stock.  The HH menu is also very large. Some of my favorites are the wings, sliders (turkey, kobe beef, classic), and nachos. Tasty.  Definitely my go to spot when it comes to HH.",

Offering beers in 3 sizes is a great idea because I can try a few in the 9 oz. size.  The only negative was when we checked in, with a 9 month old in tow, a guy walked with a pitbull-type of dog and was allowed in. Really, a dog in a restaurant? When I asked about it, the hostess said \"well it could be a service dog and it is against the law to ask\".  It would funny if it wasn't so disgusting.",

The server I had was awesome and not only split the checks correctly, but also split the guest of honor's check evenly among everyone else.  Make a reservation first for a large party.  I like the dim lighting and atmosphere.  The only thing is it gets loud, so loud that you can't really hear the music that's playing.  But who really cares to listen to the music when you're having fun?",

Not that I would ever do that, but the thought just briefly passed through my mind.   There are loads of craft beer and then some of our old favorites, so something for everyone. What I liked the most is that there are two flights of beer to choose from - the normal flight which includes several IPA's, Ales and what not - I don't care for IPA's so I skipped this one!!! But woo hoo! They had a Belgian style flight - which is my total favorite!!   My flight had Goulden Drakk - Tripel Karmelite, Frambouise and a house Belgian that is made my SILLI! Too cool!   I was there with my husband and a friend of ours and we ordered a California roll and a spicy tuna roll! They are HUGE! These are not served in the traditional roll but it looked like a round layer cake! There was plenty for three people and some left over!   This was great fun! The music is always great at the Yardhouse with the great beer and food - Just a fun time waiting to happen!!!   See you soon Yardhouse!",

She apologetically sent it back. When the burger returned we were finished eating. And the new one was well done. The beer was good (Boddingtons on tap) but by the time the food came it was nearly time to order the next meal. Nice enough people, but really awful service. What has happened to customer service? There wasn't a crowd, there seemed to be plenty of employees. No offer was made to discount the burger. I swear. So I've decided I'm posting at every restaurant I visit, often 5 or 6 a week. I would encourage you to do the same. If the service is subpar, let 'em know.",

Ive been to this yard house a bunch of times in the past few years as well as many other yard houses in the southwest. Ive never been so dissapointed before. I usually get the bernaise sliders but this time i wanted to try something new. I tried the monte cristo but it wasnt good at all here. im surprised its even on the menu. We got a few other things and it was just okay.  Service wasnt the greatest, it was very slow, but the real reason this place gets a 1 star is because of the manager. I was meeting a few friends there. 1 of them was there when i arrived and we got the table, the other came in a bit and we all ordered. The last person was just coming to meet up and she arrived either close to closing time or maybe a little bit after closing. But we were still eating. She wasnt going to eat or anything, just meet up with us and hang out till we were done. My friend went to get her and the manager came up to us and said something like, you cant do that, we're closed. We told him that she wasnt ordering anything and that she was just meeting with us until we were done eating. He said a few other words and while im eating this horrible monte cristo im thinking, are you serious right now?? Shes not ordering anything, we are all together, we are gonna finish up eating and then we are all leaving together. Does he expect her to just sit outside and wait for us?? I would NEVER expect this at all from any restaurant and the worst is that it came from a manager. Yard House should send this guy to a customer service class. Not sure if i'll return but hopefully that manager learns how to not piss off his customers.",

I think there batter is laced with crack. I can eat a entire tower by myself there that good. Though I wouldn't recommend it since your stomach won't like you if you start pounding down all that beer they have with it.  Food there is on the high side but it's worth it. Havnt ordered anything that didn't taste like it came out of a freezer bag. You wont be disappointed.   Every time I come here I always start with there sampler pack which consists of 6 beers they choose for the month. Your bound to find something that you will like.   Seriously don't come here and order a bud light or a corona. I mean really im sure there are people that just won't try anything new but really though... There will be something you will love just as much if not even better than your pre existing favorite.   There is usually a tall guy with a beard working the bar every time I come here. He has been here since it opened ad he will find something to quench your thirst :)  If your like me and have a few to many of those half yards and feel like you may have had a few to much. Dont be a dummy and drive off so the scottsdale PD can give you a DUI. Big no no! then just go walk it off in the fashion square mall.",

Yard House is the place for you!  If you just want to sit around and drink beer--Yay! You are still in the right spot.  If you want really great cuisine?  Hmm, Maybe you might try another restaurant... not that Yard House is bad (it isn't).  It is just more of a socializing place than a place to really sit and enjoy the food.",

Both were great and they even brought out a birthday dessert for my friend.

I do love beer, so it's hard to not love Yard House.   -  It's overall a meh experience. Service can be good or poor, food is OK, happy hour pricing is pretty good. The selection of draught beer is really impressive, and worth coming for alone.   It's a typical sports bar/grill type setup, large bar in the middle of the space, lots of TVs. It's a fine place to catch a game, but you'll have better luck with food, service and price at a few other places around town.  Last time I was here for HH, we had a table of probably 12 people, with napkin setups for about 9 people. Someone who looked like a manager walked by and asked if everything was going well. I asked for a few napkins for the people at the table that didn't have any (including myself). He walked away and brought back 7-8 tiny cocktail napkins. That was weird, not to mention unhelpful, and a pretty good way for me to sum up my experience there.",

    "text": "As a vegetarian, I think it's great that yard house is vegetarian-friendly with their Gardein menu. Their portions are generous, and the service is good. From their Gardein menu I have tried their Wings, Chicken Strips, Orange Peel Chicken, Gardein Burger, and Spicy Thai Chicken Salad.   My favorite gardein dish is the fried chicken strips. They are definitely not healthy and are served with french fries; but they are crispy and tasty. Good for comfort cravings at a reasonable price.  The wings are also good, I've tried the buffalo and jerk. I thought the buffalo was a little too salty, but good. The jerk wings were also pretty good as a sweet asian style wing.   The Orange Peel Chicken dish was disappointing. First, it's like $17 for brown rice and fake meat. Chinese restaurants do not charge that much for real orange chicken. Second, the orange flavor of the dish wasn't good. It just tasted like orange rind and didn't have much spice. Definitely overpriced for a basic dish that wasn't good.   The Gardein Burger was okay. The Gardein meat did not taste good and had bad texture. The texture wasn't charred or crispy. It was soft and unappealing. I've had a lot of veggie burgers and was not impressed. Yard house assembled a pretty good burger aside from the Gardein meat though.  Lastly, the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad was alright. It's a classic chicken salad with a teriyaki and celery kind of flavor. The gardein chicken was shredded and tasted okay. Maybe I just think this dish in general isn't much of a crowd-pleaser, but it wasn't anything special. I would have opted for a grilled gardein chicken Caesar salad.",

Usually when we come here at the mall, usually to visit Tiffany Co. it's during lunch hour on the weekend. I like eating out in the patio area. It's really not outside since it's under the parking structure. But it's still nice.  Service, food, and facility is always decent. Last time there, wife and I shared the chicken club sandwich. When we received it we were kinda surprise that it was a hot sandwich. We expected a cold sandwich. Didn't matter it was really good, don't sure what kind of dressing it was. But it was excellent. It comes with a lot of fries, so there is more then enough to share this dish with somebody. Yard House has a huge selection of spirits and beer. I had the pineapple cider, Always wanted to try a pineapple alcoholic beverage. It was pretty good.   Overall: They came and checked on us plenty of times, Beverages was always topped off. When we need to come by again, pretty sure we'll come by again for a meal.",

Her recommendations were on point and she was extremely personable. Lisa came in later so we didn't interact with her as much, but she was also awesome. Do yourself a favor and come here for Happy Hour, and definitely hang out at the bar. They were first class and a lot fun!!!",

Although they have the usual suspects, each city adds more local brews. So if you can't work your way around the area's brewing companies, you can sample a couple there. For that alone, I remain a fan.  This time, we weren't very hungry so decided to ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo. Truly a nice looking and upscale version of the comfort food favorite.  I'm a fan of Yard house and you really need to sit at the bar, for the full experience - so many beers on tap, so few hours in the day...",

I've been here about 3 or 4 times in the past couple of years and have always had a good experience. Most recently I visited with my mom before seeing a movie. She ordered the pepper-crusted filet mignon and I ordered the halibut. The filet was delicious and perfectly cooked, and the halibut was very fresh tasting and the parmesan potatoes and bok choy paired well with it. Our server was also very attentive and friendly and was great about refilling my water & iced green tea. (Let's just say some people are just not made for this AZ dry climate, and sadly I am one of them ... I'm *constantly* thirsty so I always appreciate the frequent refills!)",

She really set the tone for a pleasant and relaxing meal after a long day of travel.  I am a big fan of jasmine green tea and so the blackberry jasmine green iced tea caught my eye.  Ashley assured me it wasn't overly sweet and she was right.  It was outstanding and definitely a reason to return in the future.

I look forward to dining here again when I return to Scottsdale.",

If there are no reservations we would have to wait over an hour just to dine. Luckily, I found yard house and called them. I asked them how long is the wait for 2 people to dine and they said no wait. We came in around 9 30 pm . Our server Dylan sat us down to our table and served us the whole entire evening. What I loved the most was that he welcomed us, asked what we would like to drink, and when we ordered our dinner, he kept checking back on us to see how were doing or if we need anything else. He was a great server and people like him makes us customers want to come back to places like this.. Thank you Dylan for a great service and dinner with my girlfriend. We enjoyed it here very much. We will definitely come back!",

    "text": "HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  Boy do we love our HHs down here in the SW!  Gone are the images of older septuagenerian and octogenarian hovering over a buffet line. In fact most HHs seem to have nice mixture of all ages, including those just getting off from work, unwinding before the start of the weekend. For us, it was just hitting the Yard House before the start of a movie at nearby Camelview Five.   AMBIANCE/MOOD: Yard House is sort of a hip sports bar, with some really good food and lots of HDTVs. Don't be put off that the corporate parent is Darden, the same folk who own Olive Garden and Red Lobster. You'll need to remember, they also own The Capital Grille, Longhorn, Eddie V's, so they know how to make a fun and tasty experience.   The restaurant is located in the breeze way, near the two entrances of the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and the valet parking area.  We sat outside in the patio area on this visit, even though it was in the low 80s. No one was rushing to get inside.  Did I mention we were sitting in the breezeway? LOL  MENU: Unlike some, there are no special HH menu items offered by Yard House. Their HH prices are 50% off all appetizers and pizzas. These are actually the same size appetizers you would normally receive after 6 pm, so we were impressed. If you look at the photos, you'll see some really nice, mouth watering dishes.   When you are seated, you are given a huge menu that includes also everything you ever could imagine.  The steaks and burgers are really good and everything is reasonably priced. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yardhouse.com%2Ffiles%2Ffood_menu_20.pdf&s=2ceb492d5d185571d4329956251246785ec2d8b5b9325084ecea77bdf01c2b87\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yardhouse.com/files/food...</a>   The star at Yard House though is their nearly one hundred beers on tap. There are Heffes, Lagers, Pale Ales, Wheats, dark beers and so much more. If you like beer, this is your place. Nice!  SERVICE: Our server Jon was excellent. He was also teamed with an equally good supporting cast that all worked well together. Granted Yard House was half full, but everyone was on top of their game.  It was something we appreciated as we looked at our watch, thinking about the movie next door.   FOOD: On this visit we ordered the Chicken Nachos (photo) that normally goes for $11.45 and their yummy Margherita Pizza, which comes with roasted garlic on it for $11.65. Both were outstanding and made us wish we could come back later for some more.   On that topic, Yard House has what I call reverse HH with a special menu from 10 pm to close. On it you'll find such nom nom items as Black Truffle Cheeseburgers, Chilaquiles, Pastrami Dogs and something they call Monte Cristo Pops. Gosh do I enjoy truffle oil on things!  LOL  Yard House's food selection is almost as large as their beer selection.  I would guess you would need at least a dozen or so visits to try everything and I haven't even gotten to their Snacks menu.   PRICES: As noted, Happy Hour is 50% off all appetizers and pizza. Our bill came in around $23 including taxes but before gratuities. Jon was great, so we were very generous.   So Four Stars and \"yes, we're a Fan.\"   Enjoy!",

The environment was very noisy and it was difficult to have a normal conversation between the two of us. The highlight was the \"cheese curd\" appetizer, it was amazing and I wish we would have stopped there. Both our adult beverages were not good, my entree of pepperoni & mushrooms was cold and tough. My husband's entree of the crab cake was gross & mushy. We did advise our server and he offered to replace the entree and brought us a menu, the manager also came over and apologized and said to order a different entree. He did order the Nashville chicken entree and it was okay, but not great. We were very disappointed overall and glad that we weren't there with our friends to experience this restaurant  firsthand. We will not go back.",

A friend ordered wings for $5 and we shared the trio dessert for $9 - mini chocolate souffle, mini lemon souffle and mini peach apple cobbler with ice cream. That was the order of best to least-best. I need to come back here for the missed adult mac-n-cheese filled with chicken, bacon, mushrooms and other bits of stuff with a side of truffle oil. Mouthwatering just typing this.

I was pleased with the staff and how polite they were and enjoyed the vibe of the ambiance.   I started off with the Midnight Sangria which I loved! Ordered the Moo Shu egg rolls as an appetizer and really enjoyed them. I also tried one of the house favorites.. The Mac n cheese and I am completely obsessed with it!! It's loaded with grilled chicken, thick crispy bacon and mushroom not to mention different cheeses. This is a more sophisticated Mac n cheese for a mature palate. I will definitely try to copy this dish and make it for my family.  I didn't get a chance to try any deserts but this is definitely on my list next visit, I will also be trying a steak as well.",

I waled in and sat at the bar directly in front of him.  Danny didn't even greet me nor did he tell me he would be right with me.  I sat there for about 5 minutes while he was in a conversation with a couple. A few minutes later one of Danny's co-workers walked in and he asked the guy why he was there.  I was STILL sitting at the bar waiting to be at least greeted.  After Danny had a detailed conversation with the guy that walked in after me,  he turned around and walkef away, without even acknowledging me as a hungry customer, ready to patronize Yard House.    Danny has made my 1st vist to AZ and Yard House a terrible experience.  I just told the 55 people at this convention NOT to eat at Yard House in Scottsdale during my presentation.  I told the whole story about my experience and suggested that we find another place to dine during our visit.  SHAME ON YARD HOUSE FOR HIRING DANNY AND TRUSTING HIM WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS.",

The herbs were much the same, just tossed on. The seafood should be cooked with the sauce to infuse that garlic herb flavor.",

She did eventually slowdown and pay more attention to us. Overall the food was good, the service needed work but I liked the place",

    "text": "My room mate and i eat at yard house a couple times a month.  The food is always consistent and good portions for a good price.    However the one thing that this company really needs to work on is there customer service.  We were in yesterday evening and we were seated at a table near the bar area we sat there for at least 15 mins before our server even came to the table.  He asked if we had been there and we let him know that we had.  He then asked if we wanted any drinks.  Our friend ordered a diet coke, a order a glass of wine, and he ordered a moscow mule.  The diet coke came a couple minutes later the moscow mule came, about 10 minutes later my glass of wine arrived.  Some excuse about how the manager had to go and get more cause they ran out.  Our server then took our order and argued with our friend about what he wanted for dinner.  And was rude to my room mate and I when we ordered.  He then left and it was another 15 or so minutes that we saw him again.  When he came back i had asked for a glass of water and very rudely agreed to bring some water to the table.  And instead of bringing water for the table like every other table received or every other time we came in he brought just the one glass.    If i was basing a return to Yard House on this service there is no way that i would come back every.  I work in the hospitality industry and this is no way to treat a guest of your restaurant.    Please work on the service that you provide.",

Our group was about 12-15 of us and it took us a while to be seated -- fine, whatever, no biggie.  But once we sit, out waiter takes FOREVER to even say hi to us, small talking with the table behind us (the only other people he was serving). So finally he comes over and before we ordered anything, I wanted to get a round of shots to start off our vacation. Six shots took TWENTY MINUTES to come -- and the bar was an arm's length away. So I wanted to saddle up the shots bill right away -- I was charged GRATUITY for shots. Whatever, I just won't tip on it and let it pass.  Also, as someone mentioned above -- all of us were carded and hassled for our out of state IDs, even though everyone in our group was over 25.  The waiter continues to take forever and becoming frustrated, I just start to go to the bar myself to get drinks. After my 2nd or 3rd round, the manager tells me I need to stop going to the bar to get my drinks and I HAVE to let the waiter serve them (they really want that gratuity). He sits down and I tell him how slow and frustrated I am with his service. He tells me he'll make it better, asks me what I want to drink and says \"I got it.\"  So, you'd think free beer on the house, right? Nope! I get a tab at the end of the night for that drink. I hand the bill to the manager and he says, \"I never said it was free, I said I would GET IT FOR YOU.\" Oh, thanks for your great service.  Will never EVER step foot in this place just because of the customer service. Food and drinks were fine, but up there with some of the worse service I've had.",

There wasn't much of a crowd so we sat at the bar right away. We ordered our beers and the bartender asked for our Id's (which I don't mind) but this guy literally leaned across the bar really really close to look my wife in the eye and compare her to the photo on the ID, it was really uncomfortable. He even stated that it was fine but continued to give a suspicious look. Now I have a job where I look at Id's all day long, some people don't photo well but she looked the exact same on her id as she did sitting there. After that he demanded a credit card to start a tab, since we were in a hurry we just asked to pay for it now so that we could leave when we were finished and when we put down cash it just seemed like it wasn't good enough for him. He was just a strange man.   We also ordered the chicken tenders, and I just wasn't that impressed with it. I have had the pastrami sandwich there many times and love it, but the honey mustard tasted funky and the chicken just tasted like the oil it was fried in, almost no flavor. The food was fine though we ate it and still made our movie showing. Just the experience with the bartender made it an awkward experience.",

Anyways the waitress came over and sorted it out and brought us the IPA we actually ordered. I ordered the French onion soup and my boyfriend ordered vegetable and rice stir fry. His hardly had any rice, strictly vegetables and was swimming in stir fry sauce. My French onion soup was super salty and lacking flavor other than that. Wasn't impressed at all. Not worth the pricey penny either.",

The Yard House was suggested for a business meeting, so I agreed, not expecting too much and just hoping their fries were good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the \"summer salad\" option on the menu, and it did not disappoint! It was one of the most flavorful, delicious salads I'd ever had. We also all split a desert- and the Peach and Apple cobbler is ridiculously good, too.  I never had to ask for a refill of my iced tea, and our adorable server was in a really good mood.

It's non traditional mac noodles, which is a nice touch.  Once you read the description you should just close the menu and order up!  A la: chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar and parmesan with campanelle pasta and white truffle oil.  No joke, it's the real deal Holyfield.  You can definitely taste the truffle oil, but it's not overbearing.  It really adds an amazing flavor.  I guarantee you a happy foodie.  It's a rather large portion, so feel free to get a doggy bag.  It's not a bad idea to do a half portion, I'm sure it's not on the FDA's most healthy food list  ;-)  Splurge on this dish.  Trust me!!",
