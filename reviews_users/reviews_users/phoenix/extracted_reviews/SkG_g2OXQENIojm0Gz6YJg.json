    "text": "Food was decent, service sucked! The set-up to order needs a great deal of improvement. On a Friday night, you can expect the line to be out the door and pretty soon, nobody is going to want to be waiting in the line out the door in 115 degree summer weather. When we visited, there were 2 cashiers. So you wait in line, order, sit down and then they bring your food out. Again, service was VERY slow and we had to go to the bar to order our drinks because we never got them from our server.  I'm a fan of Aaron's other restaurant in Phoenix (St. Francis) and I really wanted this place to be GREAT as South Tempe could use some better restaurants and more of a selection but honestly, I was pretty disappointed.",

    "text": "I am such a fan of the Phoenix location and St. Francis that I was pretty stoked to hear that chef Aaron Chamberlin was putting a location in the East Valley (closer to home for me). I thought the decision to put a location in a quiet residential part of southern Tempe with no restaurants within a mile was pretty bold for them. They are essentially sending a message that they are going to own this area and be a cafe for the surrounding neighborhoods. I'll be honest that my first couple of visits during opening month had its issues. The lines were super long and the customer service was working through many kinks. But after a few months, Tempe Public Market is quietly settling in and becoming a staple in this area. The patio area is dog friendly and very spacious. They have plenty of misters for the hot summers and a killer fireplace for the colder winter evenings. I like that beverages (non-alcoholic) are self-serve. They have counter service for ordering your food and seating is open. These are some of those things that makes this place feel like home. So far I've had breakfast and dinner here now. The Blue Corn Pancake is fantastic. It's pretty large but not too filling for a pancake. The Steel Cut Oats are good but a little on the pricey side for me for oatmeal. I did enjoy coming here for community night for dinner. They do a 3 course dinner for around $13 that includes salad, entree and dessert. The fried chicken was nice and tender and really flavorful. Overall I can see this as a regular stop for me (especially in the mornings on that patio). I love the Farmer's Market at the Phoenix location and hope that is something that gets incorporated here someday.",

    "text": "I wrote a five star review on this place a year ago under a different name apparently you can't write a second review you can only update your first review. We went in today for the grand reopening really didn't look that different to me and the menu did not look that different. I had read on mouth by southwest that Udon noodles were added to the new menu. When we arrived I had already decided what I was going to get and I don't want to sound like a cheapskate but the noodle bowl was $15 an additional $4 to add chicken. I thought that $19 was too steep for a bowl of noodles so I chose to have the fried chicken sandwich. My partner had a Cuban. We took a table we had two fantastic iced tea's shortly after the food got delivered and I don't eat french fries very often but was very excited about having them and she barely set it down and I pulled one out and it was cold and limp. I own a kitchen and catering company therefore I find it very difficult to return items but I felt compelled and I was very apologetic asking for new fries. She apologized and took them away came back a minute later and said that they were making new ones for me. A few minutes later she arrived with a bowl of fries set them down and said  \" here you go let me know if you need us to do them over again\" this was the most condescending remark that could have been said.  So. The original fries should have never left the kitchen there was a gentleman of authority that we saw on TV that was working the pass out window, those fries should have never gone past him, the cook should have never put them in a bowl yet I'm made to feel guilty about returning them.  I think the girl that delivered the fries may have been in a position of authority. This is a very sad situation for me because Tempe Public market cafe is just blocks from my house. Don't let me fool you I am not a regular today was my fourth time there in the year or so that they've been open but unfortunately we won't be going back and I will not be able to recommend TMPC",

I appreciate the light and natural vibe. The layout is a bit weird, I'm not sure there was a plan for the line to congregate in front of the door, bathroom and coffee...but on to the good stuff: food!  Kids meals: huge, very cheap at $3! Mine had the burger and cheese pizza! FYI no drink or side with this. I'm good with no drink, my kids are fine with water. A fruit cup would be a nice add on for more $.  We also tried chips and salsa/guacamole trio, fresh and tasty. The $10 tag on this seems high to me!  Last but not least, we shared the spicy pasta/chicken. It was amazing!   Service was good, still seems some kinks are happening but that's to be expected. The only concern I had was the water/ice machine was down so customers were all using the same scoop and ice bucket to serve themselves. I know this was a temporary fix but very unsanitary.  Please give this place a try or second chance! I love what it brings to the neighborhood and we need to support other developers that want to bring local into the surrounding strip malls of S. Tempe!",

The pork could have been trimmed better to remove the fat and gristle, and it was missing the southwest seasonings that most have come to expect. The Sun Devil Fries were good and plentiful, but only 2 of the dipping sauces were to our liking and one of those was catsup.   At our table someone had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, but found it dry.  My wife suggested that we could split one in the future and just add more coleslaw to give it moisture ... but coleslaw is currently not an available side. So far the best thing we have had is the Devil's Mess breakfast - everything goes better with chorizo - and breakfast is served until 3 pm. Next time we will have a beer and split the The Rancher pizza to see if we can raise the star rating.",

Normally this isn't a big concern for me but this restaurant has a \"no straw\" policy which is the latest social justice fad.  But this means your going to put your lips to the rim of the glass to drink.  A rim that has been touched by the public and they may have just come from the restroom or maybe petting a dog on the patio.  If I do come back I'm bringing a straw or maybe even my own glass.

It was very disappointing, especially since it wasn't even late but prime dinner time. We love the location and the patio but if they run out of certain items they should let people in line know. The ordering process needs to be streamlined. We saw lots of people turn around and leave after seeing the line. I ended up ordering the cheese pizza which wasn't amazing.

    "text": "Lunch visit was very disappointing. Parking was very difficult and it was crowded in the restaurant as well. It was extremely noisy and could barely carry on conversation with people next to us. Even worse was  the high prices for mediocre food. The fries were dry and greasy. definitely not worth an extra $4.00. the grilled cheese sandwich was also dry and  had a smattering of cheese that could hardly be tasted.  Every side was an additional charge and just made whatever you ordered far too expensive for what you got. the staff who brought food to the table were very friendly as were those who checked back. It was not a visit or a meal that I enjoyed. I will not go back as there are many more restaurants to try.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place since it is very close to our house so I met a friend there at 6:30pm for dinner midweek. The restaurant was fairly quiet and there was plenty of seating outside which was nice. The patio has a comfortable atmosphere so it was great to sit outside. The menu prices are a bit expensive but we both enjoyed the roasted cauliflower dinner. Unfortunately, there were a few things that kept them from getting five stars. First, the food took quite a while to arrive after we ordered at the front and we had to ask someone walking around if they could check on it. We didn't have a dedicated server and I feel like that could help improve things if we did since they could take ownership of the tables. Second, my friend tried to order another lavender drink and they had run out. Third, they were out of the ice cream we wanted so we ordered the sprinkle one instead but they forgot about it. My friend went back to the counter after waiting 15 minutes. I really think these things could be improved if the tables had someone looking after them. Not sure yet if we'll give it another try since there are so many other dining options out there.",

I should have had a beer but it wasn't quite beer-thirty. patiently waited In an unreasonably long line to eat a  tasteless, watery bowl of quinoa and a lemon loaf that tasted like a slice of white bread. When I finally made it to the register I was much older but non the wiser. The counter service was slow, I had to bob and weave to avoid the employees walking around the cashier to the dining room. The food came out quick and after my first bite I understood why.  Half the food was nuclear hot and the other half luke warm-straight out of the microwave. Straight out of Compton would be have been better. The little  amount of  quinoa I did eat was very bland. I don't usually salt my food but I would have \"as-salted\" this dish with something I recommend-it's called flavor. I don't  recommend the Quinoa \"soup,\" or as it's called on their menu the quinoa bowl. I had  hope the lemon loaf would redeem the \"quinoa experience .\" At first bite I thought it tasted like a napkin until I realized i accidentally ate the napkin. To my dismay the pastry was mostly a very dry, bread -no lemon flavor whatsoever. My boyfriend's egg sandwich was palatable. I did finish eating the napkin. Try the pizza because everyone seems to like it. So disappointed!",

    "text": "This place was underwhelming. I've been wanting to go to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe for years (same menu) and I was so disappointed. Not only was the restaurant out of the items we ordered (rice, pretzel appetizer, etc.) but what we chose to substitute with wasn't even good and was very overpriced. $10+ for a chicken sandwich. Bun and fried chicken (no toppings bc my boyfriend d doesn't like pickles or coleslaw) that he said was mostly breading and no chicken at all. With no sides. $4 extra to add fries is a little steep when the sandwich doesn't stand alone. The salad I wanted had a few toppings out so I decided to make an \"a la carte\" style meal by ordering the sweet potato, broccoli and chicken. Pulled plain chicken with no season, plain broccoli and plain sweet potato with a side of \"Chile lime butter\" (that looked like just butter mixed with peppers). We got the chips and guacamole appetizer too - $10 for a small plate of chips but at least the salsa and guacamole had pretty good flavor. Overall this place was overpriced and just not good. We could have made several plates of what we ordered at home for way less money. The ambiance and service didn't make it worth it either when you have to get your own water and utensils. There are much much better restaurants around town and this one just can't compete.",

The \"vibe\" of the place both interior and exterior is just great.   In our group, we ordered the Cubano Sandwich, a pizza, chicken salad sandwich and the Sun Devil fries. Everything was great! Does it cost more than Carl's Junior to eat lunch here? Uh... yes. But this is  not Carls' Junior... this is a well orchestrated gourmet eatery.  I don't do a lot of reviews... but these guys deserve a shout-out! I am really surprised at some of the harsh reviews I read. Obviously, these people have never experienced a \"first-day\" event at a restaurant. They can be really tough as there is no way to know how many people will show up. The kinks will get worked out quickly and this will become a \"go to\" place in Tempe for a long time to come.  Keep up the good work guys! Having a better than expected turn out for an opening is a good thing!",

It opened just a few days ago and the line was long, so we saved a lot of time by sitting and eating at the big bar, which is a perfectly fine option. Thumbs up for their use of locally sourced ingredients. Prices are reasonable and the bartenders are very friendly. They were out of a few menu choices by 7 pm, but in their defense they have been hammered thus far! If only they'd had a few more gluten-free items on the menu (especially desserts, and maybe a GF bottled beer option, not just cider, at the bar), this celiac would have rated them 5 out of 5. We'll be back soon though.",

    "text": "I have to share my experience here this morning. My husband and I are on a time crunch but want to fit in a day date while our child is at school. We arrive at 10:50 and see that we must order breakfast or wait for lunch. I've dined here and had client meetings here before but always in the late afternoon. So we order and we wait, and wait, and wait, the manager and I make eye contact several times. Another employee looks like she just rolled out of bed, I notice three employees including the manager move my husbands TWELVE DOLLAR bacon egg and cheese sandwich under the heat lamp several times. A two minute conversations takes place 6 inches from his food between two employees. Finally my food is ready so they bring everything, it is now 22 minutes past ordering in an almost empty (and now very crazily decorated restaurant). I ordered the quiche and it's bad. The crust is burnt and there are more mushrooms than egg. The egg is gray from mushrooms, not appetizing. I ask \"are you the manager\" to the woman who is clearly the manager but ignored all of my \"where the hell is my food\" glances previously. I try to order something else (something I saw someone eating when I walked in and that is displayed on a permanent chalkboard menu) and she tells me that's just on weekends. So I order the yogurt and granola bowl. I think it's $11 on the menu. Granola? It's toasted pistachios and corn flakes... what in the world! Plain yogurt and cut up fruit.. no honey for sweetness, is the fruit organic?! What justifies these prices? We won't be back simple as that. Food and service completely lack luster.",

That is the hallmark of this \"kind of a hip\" neighborhood restaurant.  The service was a little sketchy and not well paced though the food service was timely. I do believe that the staff needs some experienced servers to crank up the new folks.  So about the noise.... It's loud. The music volume was dialed up for sure but between songs the kitchen noise was just as loud. The open kitchen concept has its issues and noise is one of them. It doesn't help when the cooks are doing what cooks do while preparing your meal, playing verbal grab-ass. Ok for a closed kitchen but it's all heard by the guests. Screaming out food orders like a 50's diner may not be the ambiance the diners wish to experience.  Look, it's good food and it's in my neighborhood and although a wee bit pricey and definitely loud, I'm glad I was there for a tasty dinner and will visit again",

We go to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe quite a bit- and the South TEMPE location is perfect for an area surrounded by chain restaurants.  Aaron Chamberlin and team kept the commitment to local vendors with items from Iconic Cocktail Company, McClendon's, Hayden Flour Mill and Peanut butter Americano.  New location is beautiful- with quite a large patio.  A new change from downtown- is that this location offers wood fired pizza! Food is delicious as always.  My favorite things in the menu:  Breakfast (healthy and non healthy): Chorizo & Eggs, biscuits & gravy (made with Chorizo) or the quinoa bowl with poached eggs (to be healthy).   Sandwiches: Cubano  Snacks: Pretzels and cheese or colours of the rainbow (vegetable platter)- again non healthy to healthy.  Dinner: Salmon or fried chicken or roast chicken or specials!  Seriously- the menu is great... but let's talk dessert! Their pastry chef is AMAZING! - homemade pop tarts (seriously amazing) - ballerina cookies (Made with nut flour) - macaroons",

    "text": "After a month hiatus I was expecting far more from the hype behind the chef who also is at the helm of ghost ranch. Now I'll preface this with letting you know I'm a foodie I've been around Phoenix's food scene; by no means am I holding this to the standard I do of the local heavy hitters or my favorite spot fnb. With that said my dining experience was not amazing (especially seeing that the executive chef was manning the burners while I was in) I had heard amazing things about the chef as I've dined at ghost ranch twice and have been informed on both occasions of the chefs extraordinary past.    Starting with the hummus...than pressing on to the  rancher pizza which wasn't bad when I compare it to a lot of pies around. Then to the entrees I noticed as the \"roasted salmon\" and \"udon noodles\" hit my table a similar taste lingered between the two dishes. Now I don't know about you but when I'm paying the $15-20 price I expect some differences when the plate hits my table, I wanted more creativity from a chef that is hyped up around the area as much as this one. Finishing my mains with the lasagna (interesting to have with what seems to be an Asian forward menu) but as out of place as it seems it was the best item I had throughout my meal. It was proper and matched that of the delicious pastries and beyond superb cocktails which were the three things that kept me in the restaurant. I'm only so harsh because of how juxtaposed the new menu is to the new decor and vibe that the place wants to give off.",

I was surprised that the crispy chicken sandwich came out with a side of potato chips. Unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed, perhaps because I was expecting more. The crispy chicken came between huge pieces of bread, which neither I nor someone else in my group ate (she had ordered the same dish). I would have preferred potato chips that were more light and crispy, like the ones that you can get from the store. Also, I have had crispy chicken sandwiches from other places and those other places just seemed to have more flavor. The chicken also wasn't very crispy either. I think if I go another time I might like the lentil soup better, but I didn't opt to try it this time.",

Our 4 star rating is an average between the 5-star atmosphere and ambiance and the 3-star food experience we had for breakfast.   First off this place is super cool, you sit where you want, it's extremely clean, inviting and the music is off the hook (it's a edm, hip hop instrumental type of vibe) and provides a great soundtrack for your dining or vining experience.  We came in for breakfast and got an iced vanilla latte, devils mess burrito style, rooster booster, and the blue corn pancake. First impression, portions are HUGE! First taste, delicious, fresh, but beware of the potatoes. It's like getting a whole potato and it cut into four - not my style! Our three year old was not impressed but his taste buds only enjoy Mac & Cheese soooo....  To expand on the ambiance, it seems like it'd be perfect for date day/night so my wife and I may come back without the kiddo.",

    "text": "We have enjoyed this place multiple times ...until last evening. They have remodeled and re-opened. Well, the changes were obvious.   Visually, it's great. However, the music was PAINFULLY LOUD- both inside and outside. We could not talk without half yelling. Even the waiter had to lean in close to take our order. -If you want loyal clientele, consider having a zone, if you will, where one can actually converse with the individual seated across the table. Maybe even two zones...a loud zone outside (bar) and another zone where the music level drops by 40 dB.  In terms of food- I had the Az burger which was soggier than in the past and the fries were less than memorable. They were semi warm and old. In the past, I have requested a second order of fries because they were so crisp and fresh. These fries were of cafeteria quality. My husband, on the other hand enjoyed the meatloaf.  Would I go back? Sorry to say, not likely. There are so many other places to spend my hard earned dollar and precious time conversing with company.  Suggestion-decide what clientele you desire... the bar scene...Or classy restaurant. Who will be your loyal repeat customers? For the time being, it won't be us.",

    "text": "I went back to TPM for a second chance on Valentine's Day after an underwhelming first impression at its Grand Opening earlier this year. Overall, a much better experience - it was raining and cold, so we didn't get to sit outside, but there was plenty of indoor seating available (although the tables are pretty close together). We were able to try the chicken and pot pie dishes this time around, and they were both delicious! The pot pie is deceivingly small - it doesn't look it at first sight, but it will definitely fill you up! I also tried the Live and Let Bee drink - one of the best cocktails I've ever had! We talked to the bartender, who told us they make their own lavender syrup in-house.   Employees came around to our table multiple times to see if we needed anything and were very polite - our dishes were bused promptly, as well. Wait time on the food was adequate!    My only gripe is that some items seem a little overpriced - $4 for a side of fries when I'm already spending $11 - $13 on a sandwich seems a little unfair, especially since they're just batched potatoes fried in oil!   Overall, I see myself returning to Tempe Public Market when I'm in the mood for a modern, trendy meal in a fun atmosphere.",

Yes, this is it.  Food was ridiculously over priced, 10 bucks for 2 eggs, 1 piece of burned dry toast, 3 decent pieces of bacon, and two very small BAKED potatoes.  In their defense the jam was decent, and they must have anticipated the dry toast and sconebecasue they give you a decent amount.  Who gives you baked potatoes for breakfast?  4 bucks for a scone? Maybe if it was good, and didn't need a lake of water to choke down. The Sahara called and needs their dry back.  You have to get your own drinks and utensils and napkins, and of course you get the obligatory stare when you don't include a tip on the receipt when you order and pay at the counter, because the only service they provide is actually bringing your food to you.  Run to a real breakfast place. May this type of do nothing overpriced average joint be quickly confined to history, that no one ever has to study.",

But if I do, it will be inside seating so I don't have to constantly swat the gnats & flies away from my plate when sitting on the patio.",

    "text": "Awesome to have a little \"local love\" in the Tempe area. After living downtown for years, we crave yummy local foods that support the local businesses.  The outside seating is my favorite. Brunch is really good. The blue corn pancake is awesome, although I wish they had a smaller order of it (it's a $10 pancake with no sides and it's huge, so it's a full commitment for breakfast!). The teas and coffees are great.  We also did dinner here. Pizza was surprisingly good. Fried chicken was awesome. Didn't love the pot pie, but my hubby liked it.  Great place to ride the bikes and hang for a happy hour cocktail or two!  Definitely a regular spot for us going forward.",

    "text": "Last night was the first time my husband and I had been into Tempe Public Market since their reopening and it was fabulous! We sat at a table across from the bar, enjoyed some tasty drinks and had a delicious bite to eat. From the moment we walked in, the hostess greeted and seated us and our waiter was pleasant and personable; welcoming us immediately. As we sat there, our waiter got a little busy which is understandable, Erin must have seen our faces and came from behind the bar, inquired if she could be of any assistance, asked us about our day and shared the evening specials with us. Both of which sounded amazing! She went out of her way to ensure we had a great experience; we didn't sit there for long before we ordered with our waiter and she checked on us again before we left. Tempe Public Market provided us with fabulous customer service from the moment we entered to the moment we left, prepared a scrumptious meal and served up some pleasing cocktails. We will be making this a weekly dinner outing but next time will bring our friends.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to this place after all the preopening hype,but was sadly disappointed.  However, as it's new, will probably try it one more time.   My wife and I visited on a Sunday evening and were impressed with the buildout and ambience.  Nice big patio, dog friendly, cool fireplaces.  I'm not sure how well this will work when it's 110 degrees this summer, but the patio is quite spacious. The interior is typically modern hipster-friendly, clean and well appointed. Nice looking place.   First of all, you have a Chipotle-like line which is SLOW.  And then, you have to wait for your order to be delivered. We waited over forty minutes from line to serving.  That's not so great.    We split a Cuban sandwich, which was $13 with no side.  ($4 extra for an order of fries). Bread was fine.  Very little meat.  I've had Cubans for $10 with twice the meat.  Apparently this joint has taken a lesson from Jimmy Johns on shorting sandwich fillings.    Similar items on the menu seem to be overpriced compared to other places.   We took advantage of the happy hour beer prices, and that was fine.  The Tempe Lager was good.  As stated, I'll give Tempe Public Market at least another try before moving on. But the combination of high prices and (at least in this case)  mediocre food isn't a good harbinger for the future.",

The first few times I tried to stop by, it was too busy to stay, fortunately the new restaurant storm of people has passed.  Overall pretty disappointed with the food, the habanero wings while crispy but had no heat and were cloyingly sweet, in fact the chicken quesadilla had better fire although the barely a teaspoon of guacamole on the side was a bit sad, either provide a reasonable scoop or take it out of the dish.  As I live in the neighborhood, I really wish them success by compared to the downtown Phoenix Public Market, the food misses the mark.",

I know you can't control all the pests when the doors get open and closed all the time, but there is an ungodly amount of flies inside the building.  We literally moved outside to get away from the flies.    2. Food takes forever to come out. You wait in a line that take forever to get though then you have to wait to get your food. All I ordered was the Rooster Booster which is eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes. Took over 45 minutes for food to arrive.   3. Food is decent.  Staff is friendly, but those pros don't outweigh the cons.  The manager on duty was very polite. She offered me a refund, but I declined as the food arrived as I went to speak with her, so I feel taking a refund at that point wouldn't have been appropriate.   I really don't think I'll be back.",

Tonight my partner and a friend came in for dinner after being on the road for 6 hrs from Los Angeles. We were tired and hangry. So we ordered one of their pan pizzas two cubano sandwiches and a chicken salad sandwich. We ordered the food at 7:20 and didn't get our pizza until almost and hour later, followed by the chicken salad sandwich and then a few minutes later the manager tells us they are out of the Cubanos in which he gave a 20 dollar gift card for the trouble which we appreciated. We then ordered a burger and a fried chicken sandwich but they were out of the chicken so we just had another chicken salad sandwich and the burger packed up. He did comp the entire bill and asked us to give them another chance which we will. The place has potential. Sorry the first impression wasn't as great as I had hoped. We will be back",

The last time we went - yes, we made the mistake of going back for brunch - the gravy on the eggs was cold. NEVER GOING BACK! What a shame too! Great setting, just horrible food and service! Read my previous review for details.)  From the minute I walked in this place was chaos.  The workers look frazzled and disorganized. As I was waiting in line I was told by a cashier that she could help me at her register. So I headed over only to find there was someone at the register, and causing the people behind me on line to order before me at the other register. Then I ordered Tito's Cubano without pickles and dijonnaise. I was told that all the sandwiches are premade. As I rethought my selection another worker told me they could make me a fresh sandwich, so I ordered it. Some time later, how long, I'm not quite sure, we (well my family) got their orders, but it felt like eternity. My sandwich did not come out. Shortly after a manager came to the table and advised me that they were making my fresh sandwich. Bless his soul. He was very apologetic. Unfortunately, he was mistaken. No one was making me a fresh sandwich. In fact I received the sandwich without pickles, however, upon inspecting the supposed fresh sandwich, and much to my surprise, discovered that the staff had simply removed the pickles, leaving behind pickle residue (I didn't go graduate for nothing). To wrap things up, my daughter said her hamburger was dry. My other daughter hated her grilled cheese. On the plus, my wife seemed to have enjoyed her salmon and the fries were top notch, hence the one star. We've been for brunch before and will only return for brunch, as that was a much more pleasant experience",

They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as some delicious looking desserts in a glass case. In addition to their bar they also have a coffee bar.   You order at the counter and pay first. We chose to sit inside since it was getting warm outside. I had the frittata and had a bite of the Devil's mess.   The frittata was a large portion, filled with fresh, perfectly cooked vegetables, arugula and soft eggs. The Devil's mess was good as well, and I liked the combination of chorizo with scrambled egg.  The vibe inside is upbeat, with a few TVs and when we were eating here the music was on the cusp of being too loud for me. For me personally if I'm at a restaurant I don't want my ears to be drowned out by music if it's breakfast time and I want a peaceful relaxing morning with the person I'm eating with. If I go again I'll probably check out the patio and maybe bring the pups to try more from their menu.",

We have been probably 6 or 7 times, but seem to have bad experience after bad experience!  We keep hoping it will get better. Service is unremarkable, the food is average. We were excited when they revamped the place hoping it would be better.  Tonight we went to try again and were surprised it was changed to table service and despite it being only 25-30% full we were quoted a wait of 45 minutes!  When they used to have you order at the counter it was so much easier.  Sorry TPM, we are out.",

I also appreciate seeing the menu items go from pizzas to crispy chicken sandwiches. The desserts are a whole another thing! Most importantly both David and Forbes topped off this STELLAR experience. Unfortunately I have had consistently not attentive servers but they definitely have popped in and asked how I was doing in between my server helping. Thank you both so much for being helpful and caring. These two go above and beyond and are truly genuinely nice people.",

Walking in, the first thing I noticed was all the patio seating with separate cozy spaces. Today was cooler so they actually had two fire pits going during the day, which you don't typically see here in AZ. It immediately created a \"warm\" vibe - both literally and figuratively!   Since I didn't have enough time to dine in, I opted to try two takeout options - the bacon (soft) pretzel ($5) and the lemon pound cake (around $4). You could tell the pretzels were homemade and they even had a little bit of mustard hidden on the inside - yum! The lemon pound cake was soooo moist - I know, I know, I hate that word too but I can't think of any other way to describe it, haha. Not too lemony and definitely buttery.    Prices aren't cheap. BUT, one of the things I noticed and that struck me during my short visit here was seeing how genuinely happy and enthusiastic all the employees looked. That is something I am willing to pay a little more for!",

The bar is nice and the outdoor seating area great..fireplace and quite a bit of seating. Same indoors .. It's loud.. dont plan to talk much unless you're screaming .. background music .. it's an 8 with 10 being a horse track ..typical trendy type place ..  Portions are decent sized.  Wouldn't make a point to come back but if it happened to be right in front  of me and I was hungry I would return",

My friend and I grabbed a table at the bar on the patio side after recommendation by Ken(restaurant employee). I loved sitting outside and enjoying the ambience and the nice breeze.   We sat close to bartender that helped with our every need from being us ice cold water when we sat down to recommending several of his favorites on the menu. I decided to try the sandwich that he recommended and it did not disappoint me! After the first bite I immediately knew why he loved this sandwich, as the chicken was hot/ juicy and hand breaded. The sandwich was topped with crunchy slaw and bread/butter pickles and if I am not mistaken I tasted a bit of honey drizzled on the chicken. I cut the sandwich in half thinking I could only eat one half but I quickly finished the sandwich. I will order the crispy chicken sandwich again.   Tip.. The parking was challenging so car pool if you are going in group as there are other business in this complex.",

    "text": "\"For every minute you are angry, you lose sixty seconds of happiness.\"  Tell yourself this while you wait in line because that line is fierce.  Ah, the latest restaurant from chef Aaron Chamberlin.  We had to pop in!  A group of us came on their Grand Opening, January 12th.  Earlier in the day, they had ran out of food and had to reopen at 5PM.  At least that means the food was fresh, right?  The five of us ordered:  House Pretzels - Handmade pretzels with a jalapeno white cheddar sauce. $7.50:  These were pretty great.  They're not the best cheese and pretzels in town but the cheese sauce was excellent.  The blend itself was nice but the texture was a bit grainy.  The pretzels were also salty and good.  Lentil Curry Coconut Soup. $8:  I would pass on this.  It's nothing memorable and tastes exactly how you would imagine it would:  like curry!  I was hoping for more coconut flavor.  Side of French Fries. $4:  These were ordered by mistake.  We had wanted to try the Sun Devil Fries.  Don't get me wrong though, the fry on these babies were perfect.  It had a crispy exterior and creamy interior.  We sprinkled on some Parmesan cheese and they were devoured.  Brick Pressed Chicken - Garlic mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach with a lemon thyme sauce. $16.50:  One of the disappointments of the night.  I'm glad Amber R. ordered this and not me, hah!  This bird had no seasoning on it whatsoever.  You would think the lemon thyme sauce would be sufficient but it wasn't.  Even tossing on some salt and pepper didn't save it.  It needs Jesus to be saved.  I will say that the chicken was juicy.  The potatoes had no garlic taste either.  Fried Chicken - Mixed greens and mashed potatoes. $16:  This was so Gucci.  I didn't think I'd be wowed by $16 fried chicken but it was good!  No bone, white meat, and crunchy.  I'd order this again.  The Rancher - Scheiner's sausage, pepperoni, cheese blend, house made tomato sauce. $16:  This was delicious.  That sausage was flavorful and fatty and it made my skirt flip.  It was an excellent wood-fired pie.  Farmers Market Pizza. $13 - Braised leeks, mozzarella blend, shaved Brussels sprouts, Parmesan, Meyer lemon, chives. $13:  Although this is a vegetarian pizza, I didn't miss the meat.  It was a very light and refreshing pie and it made me feel good.  Definitely squeeze the lemon on top for a bright note of flavor.  We also had the Live And Let Bee [gin, honey, lavender, lemon juice], Monsoon Season [Kraken black spiced rum, lime, ginger beer], and a Sangria [red wine, brandy, fresh juices, seasonal fruit] at $8 each.  I gotta say I wasn't impressed with the cocktails.  For the most part, the flavors weren't balanced.  I'd pass on cocktails here.  We also got a free cookie as per their Facebook post.  Oh and the macarons were pretty tasty too.  So the staff here are beyond friendly and work very efficiently.  The food had some hits and misses, the price point is on the higher side, but I wouldcome back once the hype dies down and/or come during off-peak hours.  Welcome to Tempe, TPMC! 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "So here's the scoop... for weeks I've been eyeing this place as I head to the gym just across the way in the parking lot. Lots of construction, looks of dirt and then one day,  saw the signage go up and knew what to expect. One of my fav spots downtown is the Phoenix Public Market Cafe so when I learned this was an extension, I couldn't be happier than to see this place make it way to my neighborhood.   So I came in on Thursday and learned they had a soft opening the night before and that the grand opening was scheduled for Friday, Jan 12... After my gym workout, I thought to sneak in a drink & dinner at the outdoor bar.   The overall layout is great. You can order when you 1st come in and then head to a table or go directly to the bar which seats both inside and outside. Outside at the bar, I had a nice view of 2 TV's with basketball on and decided to order a Cafe Fresh Juice... I got Hulk seeing how I just came from working out which had spinach, celery, green apple, kale, parsley, lemon, and cucumber... They make and package in the morning but I was fortunate that they had one in the late afternoon. A bit pricey at $6.50 but it was worth it.   Happy hour starts at 4pm and I saw a few items of interest from the people around me. Instead, I had the Salmon with mashed potatoes and seasoned veggies. The ideal meal after a workout right... it was on point and very delicious. It wasn't fishy tasting and the wedge of lemon sealed the deal as it was perfect throughout. No salt or pepper needed for the mashed potatos or fresh veggies. The atmosphere was great as everyone seated by the bar interacted with the bartenders and one another as we looked at even sampled some of everyone's food.   Looking forward to coming back to try the Chicken Freid Sandwich, nachos, and special fries as part of Happy Hour. No major issues, but with a new spot opening you always expect a few kinks during the 1st few weeks....c",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here on Sunday for breakfast.  It was our first time here.  I ordered The Flanched Flarney Garney, hands down the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had.  The eggs were rich, combined with the sharpness of the cheese and the creaminess of the avocado it was a match made in heaven!  My BF ordered The Rooster Booster, basic eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast.  It was just okay.  He only received one slice of toast (99 % of the time you receive 2 pieces)  and it did not have butter nor did they offer butter on the side. I also ordered a side of crispy potatoes, they were very crispy - but did lack flavor.  I took them home and I will doctor them up for another meal. I was disappointed in how many flies were flying around...we sat  INSIDE the restaurant.  There were at least 30 flies just on the side of the restaurant we sat on.  You might have better luck with fewer flies if you sit outside ;) All in all, I think it was a pretty good place.  A bit pricey for the area but we will be back to check out their lunch and dinner.",

Unfortunately, the line and the process to Oder is a complete NIGHTMARE! I stood in line for over 25min to order the Chicken dish with mash and Spanish, Pretzels w cheese sauce, and a grill cheese. My Pretzels were over baked and not worth the $$, however, cheese sauce was flavorful but a little too grainy, Chicken & Mash meal was mediocre, and my sons grill cheese came with no side and honestly it was just average. As a matter of fact the cheese was a little hard. In addition, I had two IPA's that costed me $15 in total! Are we in Scottsdale?? I'm not sure if I'll be back. Maybe only when I have guests in town on a beautiful evening I'll take them here to sit on the patio and have a few domestics. Overall, the restaurant is great for my area. I just hope business stays steady after all the curious hype is over and when people realize the overpriced menu for what you get.",

For instance today I stopped as I was in the neighborhood trying a new yoga studio. I was excited to pop in and take something home (this was my 2nd time here) and I got the Chino salad, which literally had 5 cashews on it. I asked for no protein and their was no price reduction (concerning since all I got was a head of cabbage and a small amount of other items). $10.50 is a bit much, should have gone to Salad & Go. Last time I was there at TPM, I got the Superfood Salad and again it didn't thrill me. I will say the pretzels are pretty tasty, trying to remember what my husband had and can't even which goes to show no lasting memory. I do know he told me he didn't really care to come back, which is why I tried again on my own. If you go don't get the salads, try something else but be prepared for spending some money. Also had the apple cake today but again nothing special, not a lot of flavor and somewhat dry. Sadly, I am not sure I will return.",

Tempe has very few independent, non-chain restaurants.  2. we absolutely love Phoenix Public Market.   We arrived on Sunday night at 5:30, line almost out the door... why was there only one register open, and two people standing next to it doing nothing??  Ordered food- 40 minutes later half our order came out, waited another 10 for the rest of our food. Then some of the food was cold!   Food runners all seemed like they were walking in sand- very slow and sloppy dressed. Speed was no existent.   The location is great, building and ambience is great. Management has a ton to fix. Dine in Phoenix at St, Francis  or the original PPM.",

I gave this review three stars largely because I've enjoyed my past experiences at Phoenix Public Market and I know my experience at Tempe could have been better. I was out of town opening weekend or else I would've been there. In seeing a line when I got there, it didn't look terrible so I swiftly got in line started my watch to count the time. For how short the lined looked, the wait was much longer than I was expecting. In total, I waited 30 minutes in line to order. I then proceeded to wait 40 minutes for my food. Eek. I honestly thought they forgot about my order and finally flagged someone down to check on it.   I ordered the rice bowl and my friend got a the superbowl salad. When we got our food, my friend said, \"I waited this long and they couldn't even cut my vegetables smaller?\" Hmm, she was right. In my case, the raw veggies were layer on top of a bed of rice. Don't get me wrong, the rice bowl was decent. The rice was a good texture and veggies were fresh but the vinaigrette had a little kick (I think it was ginger or red pepper flakes?) that wasn't specified on the menu. Since it was unexpected, I didn't use much and basically ate a bowl of raw veggies. That's all I can really say about the food. Maybe my expectations were too high?  In combination of the wait time and taste, I know I've had better.",

This is such a needed establishment in this area, it's awesome to have this place right down the street. As with all new restaurants, they are still working out the kinks of what works and what doesn't- the line to order food is a bit congested every time we go, but that'll change with time.   The food is awesome and as someone who does the Keto Diet- the fact that you can order things and easily have stuff be substituted or switched out is awesome. Definitely check these guys out during the week, weekends seem packed and lunch time can get a little crazy. The parking lot is weird, but considering the whole plaza is a little weirdly shaped, it's not surprising parking can be a battle now.",

The bartender could not have been nicer and more attentive, and brought out a water bowl for my pooch.  I strolled back to my patio table with my brew, and the happy hour munchies I ordered  (personal pizza, and chicken wings), arrived in 10 minutes, from an equally upbeat server.  Will the food win a James Beard Award?  No.  Was it hot, tasty and fresh bar fare?  Definitely.   Had one more beer, probably spent around 90 minutes there taking in the pleasant afternoon breezes.  The crowd was what you would expect for the area, mostly 30s and 40s professionals after work, well dressed and attractive.  My bill for two pints of Dos Equis Amber and two appetizers?  A whopping $23  Very enjoyable experience",

The inside and patio area are all really great seating with a bar in the middle for easy access whether you're inside our outside.   I got the breakfast quinoa bowl and my friend got the crispy chicken sandwich and they were both really solid. I loved the dill Dijon sauce that came with the crispy sandwich.

I considered getting up to get my own coffee at one point. My food came cold, rarely did anyone stop to check on our table and let alone refill my drinks. I also stood at the host counter for way too long until the waitress who told me to go wait for the host eventually ended up needing to come back and seat us. I tried their version of a Pop Tart and the minute you being the pastry up to your mouth you can smell the egg in the batter and/or frosting. It's very off putting. The jam inside seemed to not go with the pastry and frosting. It was like three flavors that didn't mesh well together. The eggs and bacon were good just cold and it was almost impossible to get someone to bring over hot sauce and ketchup.",

    "text": "I was so very excited for this place to open. It is literally what we have been waiting for in our neighborhood. I invisioned this being our \"watering hole\" and would have many great breakfast, lunches, dinners and happy hours. I visited twice before I made my final judgment, although the 2nd visit was better, I was sad to know this was not as pleasing of a place as anticipated. Coffee is just not good, I tried and tried. The process is not explained and I was not aware I had to pickup coffee at the bar. 2nd visit, I was listening for my name, food came out in parts about 5 minutes in between. My coffee still had not arrived, I did not hear my name called because its LOUD and I was only a table away. When I inquired they said, \" take Melissa's, I bet she took yours.\" Melissa soon arrived looking for her small coffee that I was given and I had ordered a large. Plus coffee taste bitter and should be something that brings you back for breakfast or stop in and pick up before work. Food: 1st visit was Quiche, it is over priced for the portion, not very good and cold. Coffee bad. 2nd visit with son and friend from out of town....biscuits and gravy were very good, no sides with it, but good and made the price worth it. Sons granola and yogurt dry with a ton of granola and little yogurt. Although a good amount of fruit, cut them in to bite size, they are generous big chunks.That's an easy fix. Frittata, over priced, especially when you have to pay extra for the basic side that most breakfast include, potatoes. I am more dissapointed because I feel we have to settle for a mediocre  establishment and would not dare to gamble paying for an over priced dinner just to be dissapointed. Maybe I was to excited and may have had high expectations for such a phenomenal location and patio. When the food is excellent, price is worth it. I see this as a possible happy hour spot during good weather in a nice patio on 1 or 2 occasions. Have not tried their drinks yet, that can't be dissapointing, fingers crossed. That will be my last effort before I give up on this place.",

    "text": "Remember the Campaign slogan \"It's the Economy, stupid!\" ? Well, in the case of the new Tempe Public Market Cafe, \"It's the Patio, stupid!\"...... whoever designed and decorated the Patio here was a genius. It's gorgeous. Name me another restaurant in the 85284 zip code where you can sit outside and watch the setting sun during our amazing early Spring evenings? The chosen corner was brilliant. .... which goes a long way toward explaining the onslaught of customers in TPMC's early days. Certainly it is not for the food or drink. Overpriced. Skimpy portions. Average. A good example is the Pork Verde Pot Pie. Sounds amazing, right? Especially to Az patrons. For $11.50, it should be the size of their large white bowls - not the same size and tin foil presentation of a $2 Banquet Pot pie from Fry's. It tasted good, yes. While it lasted. .... The lesson here is that Tempe could support about 5 more restaurants like this - the crowds show we're starved for just this kind of ambience, and women will keep dragging their husbands here- at least initially- for this reason. But the minute a huge ugly Apartment complex goes up on the NW corner to block that setting sun and spoil the esthetics? The prices must come down and/or the food and method of service change, or *this* \"South Tempean\" will head back on over to Espo's- reliable fantastic Mexican food reasonably priced and-oh yeah- they now have a great patio as well.",

Sadly, I have been there three times only to be met with average food that doesn't have average pricing.  I am hopeful the menu items get better.  The Chinese Chicken salad was somewhat bland.  The pizza was, so sorry to say, very average -- a toss up between what you would expect at a very average takeout and something I could throw together at home with store bought items.  I am not writing this to complain but to hopefully help make it a better restaurant because like I said, I want it to make it!  I want it to succeed for more than it's hip vibe and cool bar.  I want the food experience to be something I put on my go to list of places for lunch and dinner.  I'm not a fussy eater or picky at that, which is why I have gone there three times, each time hoping for an even better experience. I am still hopeful it will get better and will probably go back again to make sure I give it the chance it deserves.",

After a poor yelp review one of the managers mailed me a gift card due to the bad service and the place just being chaotic! We spent  a good 40 some dollars in there our first time. We went back yesterday for breakfast and to much of my disappointment the gift card did not even cover one entree! It was for 10 dollars! At least cover an entree! The food is not good. No flavor, super small portions . My boyfriend ordered a quinoa breakfast bowl and it was enough to fill up a toddler. We added potatoes to it which cost 3.00 ( we got about 3 chunks of potatoes) in the meal. Ending up costing about 13.00 for a measly breakfast bowl!!! I had the breakfast burrito. Again very bland and it was served with 3 grapes. Ordered two coffees and the coffee was horrible! Meal still cost us 23.00. Overpriced food for small portions and it's not even good  food! Don't see this place lasting long!!! We won't be back !!!!",

    "text": "My wife and I went here last Saturday afternoon to check it out, we live in the neighborhood. Arrived at 3:45 and sat at the bar. I asked if they had a happy hour menu. The bartender said \"sure\" and handed it too me. My wife ordered the house chardonnay for $4 and I ordered a kilt lifter for $3. We looked at the food menu and decided not to order anything because it all looked over priced, for example the cuban sandwich is $11, but if you want fries with that, it's another $4. $15 for a sandwich and fries. So we decided not to eat there and asked for the bill. When I got the bill, I noticed I was charged regular price for the drinks, which I believe was $8 for the wine and $5 for the beer (this was a twelve ounce bottle, not a 16 ounce draft!). I brought it to the attention of the bartender, his reply was \"happy hour doesn't start until 4:00, it's when you place your order\". I looked at the ticket and the time stamp was 3:52. He would not adjust the price, so I paid $5 for a bottle of beer! I could get a 16oz. craft beer for that much somewhere else, and that's what I'll do from now on. We will not be back. This place is way over-priced and I don't expect it to last long once the novelty wears off.",

So today we got there a bit earlier  at around 11:00 A M and it was not so packed . The ambiance of the place is excellent the build out of the facility is beautiful . I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich and the wife ordered the Superfood Salad . Both items in our opinion were horrible ...we eat at various other places like A J's , Panera and Whole Foods and all of those places put out quality good tasting food at reasonable prices . I would suppose other items on the menu could be better . Chicken salad is a very common item that you can get almost anywhere and I am almost never disappointed when I order it no matter where I go . So this was just a total surprise to me how bad this sandwich was .The Superfood salad looked disgusting and did not taste much better I spent $ 25.00 on these two items (included  a $2.00 tip on credit card at the checkout ) and was just really disappointed in the food ,,,.hard to believe but True .... \"OVERPRICED & UNDERWHELMING \" .",

    "text": "I have been there three times.  Each time I have walked down, as I live 1/2 mile away. South Tempe needed a place like this, expectations are high. Each time I've been there, the line was extremely long, and only one register open. I get it that the kitchen can only work so fast, but..........people would rather wait SEATED AT A TABLE than STANDING IN LINE!!!!  Open the second register!!!  EVERYONE in line is extremely frustrated by this!!!  Like I said, if I'm waiting 45 minutes or longer from arrival to food, I would feel much better sitting at a table with the rest of my party than standing in line feeling frustrated seeing a closed register. OPTICS matter!!  Next comes the fries (Sun Devil fries). Get a new fry recipe, or at least make them as good as they are described on the menu. Soggy, undercooked fries sloppily thrown in a bowl, a little crushed garlic thrown on top, and a sprinkle of (I think) parsley, and a few shreds of Parmesan. When I see chili, parmesan, garlic fries, it would be nice to taste all of those things. If they are done right and full of those wonderful flavors, you don't need dipping sauces!  I truly believe, you put out killer finger licking fries and people will come!!!  The winner so far is the crispy chicken sandwich, awesome!  Cubano was also very good....a tad stingy on the meat but still good. Quiche was flavorful but serving size was almost embarrassing. Pizza just ok.....I prefer a thinner crust. Green chili pot pie was pretty good...too much of one distinct seasoning, perhaps chili powder?  Biscuits & gravy were really good, as was the frittata. Bloody Mary's were also very good!  Wait staff is very friendly and helpful. Patio is great, inviting, dog friendly......a lovely place to relax and be thankful we FINALLY have a neighborhood restaurant!  So with a little tweaking (fries fries fries!), more efficient ordering (more sitting and less standing), a few details here and there.......I know I will get to a shining 5 star review!!!  Thank you for giving us all such a lovely gathering place!!",

Ordered my food and it came quickly. Had to ask for ketchup, had to ask for sugar/Splenda and she forgot silverware. The server who brought out the food noticed and went and got it for me.   Problems I noticed. Should have a sign on all door saying Host/Hostess at front entrance will sit you. I saw over 3-4 parties come in from others doors and looked confused or sat down themselves. Also make sure you have staff at Host area. People were upfront waiting for 30-45 seconds for help/directions. Finally I heard complaints from people on patio with slow service and also waiting for coffee for 10-15 minutes.  Also last thing, The hanging lights at the bar blocks the TV if you are in 2 of the seats !!  I realize they will fix and get better.",

Needed a table for 2, was seated outside and it literally took 25 min just to have someone stop by to see if they could grab some water for our table.  Ordered from their breakfast menu which was delivered 40 min later, then had to wait for silverware. My omelet was burnt but still edible.  I've been here before during the week and there is a bit of a lag after ordering.  Don't know if I would come again on a weekend unless I had nowhere else to be.",

Although it was not originally our first choice, the food and atmosphere proved it a good choice nonetheless. There are giant outdoor fireplaces, smaller fires you can sit around, and a decent bar. The food took a while to wait in line and order and then get brought out to the table, but we were able to enjoy the small beer and wine selection while we waited. The crispy chicken sandwich and fries were delicious.",

I had to negotiate with the waitress showing her the menu item that is listed as \"2 eggs any way\"....I asked for a two egg omelet.  I got a nasty glare from her.  We found Italian sausage on the menu, she didn't know they were sausages.  The waitress asked if I liked the omelet and I said it would have been nice with some cheese. She said ...well, you didn't ask for any. I told her she should have told me it was plain.  She ignored us from then on.  I was there before the renovated to the new look and it is very cool looking and they did a great job.  But they need a few conventional dishes for some to enjoy. Not everyone likes artisan dishes.  Especially the kids sitting behind us.  There's nothing for kids on the menu.  KW",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times but was holding off writing a review since my feelings towards this place are somewhat ambivalent. I really don't enjoy this format of restaurant where you order at the counter and then have to find your own seat. I prefer the full service restaurant style or else fast casual format works too but this weird hybrid bugs me. Mostly because you have the expectation of full service but all three of my visits here the service was seriously lacking. This last time, my friend and I went for brunch after a hike. We were able to snag a table right away but there was no silverware on it. We hunted around but couldn't find any and finally someone brought some. Coffee was self-serve but the dispenser as well as the carafe with the creamer were empty. We also both got bloody marys and mine came out right away but hers took forever (we were on separate checks). Food was also slow in coming out but once it did, it was pretty tasty. I got the Devil's Mess which I loved and she also liked her veggie frittata. I also ordered a side of sweet potatoes which were only cooked half way thru. I am assuming they rushed them since our food had taken so long and by that time I was too hungry to care much.  I'm not sure if I would really come back for breakfast again because of all the above issues. However, they do have an amazing beer list and have been a couple times to just sit at the bar and it was pretty cool. Once it cools down and the patio is more comfortable I can see coming back for happy hour.",

Which apparently there are 2 front doors. What?  The line was long which was fine being it's Sunday morning/afternoon - very slow moving and you're blocking the the front door and the bathrooms so people are constantly trying to get around you.  You also can't tell if it's a sit down restaurant or a stand in line, get a number and sit. Apparently it's both but it's not clear and no employees are going to help you out no matter how obvious it is that you've never been there before.  The line is super slow moving and you can't see what other people are eating until you are basically next in line to order. Nothing looked good - everything was super dry and bland looking. The only thing I was considering was the Tito's Cuban (based on a yelp photo I saw) but when I saw a man eating it I decided against it.  The fried chicken sandwich was the only thing that was a maybe - so when I went to order that they said they were out of the chicken salad and chicken. Literally nothing anyone was eating looked good so even though I committed all that time waiting in line I decided to go to the crepe place across the street.",

The decor is great, I love the open outdoor patio and the look of the market. We each ordered a coffee, one being an espresso and the other a cold brew. Both were fantastic. However, our name was never called, or wasn't called loud enough but I happened to walk to the bar and they were ready. I ordered a Mediterranean salad, and added chicken. Overall the salad was really delicious and the dressing was really light and not overwhelming. I think the price was a little high, but not too out of the norm.  So, two thumbs up for atmosphere, coffee, and my salad.   Here's the downside. My husband ordered a grilled cheese, and paid $4 for a side salad. This was a JOKE!! Seriously. If you're going to put a grilled cheese on the regular menu, not the kids menu, then you better make it worth it. There were two small slices of bread, and cheese only on half. No kidding. And the side salad: a small cup of lettuce, a few shredded carrots, and 1 half of a cherry tomato. Come on. For $4? My husband was super disappointed and left hungry.  Also, no forks on the tables and none in the containers outside at a little bussing station. Had to wander around until I found one inside. This is just a bit of feedback for staff, didn't really bother me, but kind of a drag on the first impression.   Overall, I still think this place has some potential, and great decor. I'd give this place one more shot based on the coffee and my salad. However, if the food isn't better on the next try, my husband (and sadly I) won't be back. I'm going to give it 3 stars, mainly for the coffee and the atmosphere.",

No free cookie with Yelp check in like they have at the sister restaurant. What's up with that?! My salmon was not over cooked and my veggies were fresh and delish! I like the vibe with open patio/bar with fire place. Nice addition to the East-ish Valley!",

The Chicken Pot Pie my wife got did NOT have a flaky crust, in fact it was almost too hard to break through.  The chicken inside was LARGE chunks.   The Cubano I got had nicely toasted bread but the internals were room temp at best with almost zero sauce other than on the sides. The waitperson brought my daughter's food almost 5 minutes before the rest of the food arrived. It is on us that we didn't send our food back.",

They only had one cashier open and she was having problems taking people's orders so the line was very slow--that was OK, everyone has to learn in the beginning. We ordered the breakfast sandwiches and the poptart; figuring out how to get coffee was too difficult and everyone was confused so we skipped that. We were served our food fairly quickly and the food tasted OK. Nothing fantastic--certainly seemed overpriced. My mother was a big fan of the poptart surprisingly. I thought it was just meh. Not sure what all the hype is about this place; maybe just that it has taken it such a long time to open??? We'll try the dinner menu sometime in the future once things calm down a bit.",

We also had the Caesar salad with chicken (the chicken is like a pulled rotisserie style which is my favorite on a salad) and the cornbread croutons were perfection. Lastly, we had the salmon and vegetables. The salmon was cooked to perfection with a great array of potatoes and veggies on the side. A really great healthy alternative to pair with the pizza! Haha   The outdoor seating is awesome as well as the fireplace. Great ambiance and the service was what I would come to expect from their other location (Phoenix Public Market)... very friendly and helpful. They were quick to remove plates, which is great because I love not having to stare at my plate after I finish my meal.   Overall, \"GREAT\" experience and food!  ^ Just realized I totally over used the word \"great\" but it was all fantastic, so whatever. ;-P",

    "text": "THANK YOU for coming to Tempe!!! I was there on opening day, and probably because I've experienced each of chef Chamberlin's other restaurants, I was expecting a crowd. So, of course, it was a packed house! It's an OASIS in the desert of south Tempe, where such creativity is sparse. So, yeah, people will be excited when it opens up, DUH!!! I wanted to hold off on a review until I had been there more than once & I've been there a couple times since, so...  A little note about the Presta coffee they serve, because this one caught me a little off my guard this morning: I almost never drink coffee without some kind of milk or cream. If I do, it's because I ran out. I tried it black today & it was so good, I actually opted to forgo the cream on all 3 cups! If you're a cream or milk person, try this coffee black beforehand & you may surprise yourself.  I had the Rice Bowl on opening day and it was DELISH! Also, the Flanshed Flarney Garney is so easy to love, it's a no-brainer. I'd recommend it to anyone, especially if you're a breakfast lover. Or, if you just like food. Or, if you breathe air, you will likely be someone who enjoys it. It's my fav thing on the breakfast menu. Also, treat yourself to a vegan cookie, even if you're not vegan. You won't be sorry & it won't make you a vegan, I promise!  This patio is such a great place to hang out; it's cooler than 98% of resort pool areas in the valley. I can ONLY believe this was previously a Circle K because I saw it before. The transformation is awe-inspiring. I love how the demolished concrete was integrated into the planters and the fireplace. All of the redwood built-ins are gorgeous! They should win an award for how cool the building is, not to mention for transforming an entire intersection. I can't wait to see the ripple effects this has throughout this area.",

No reason they shouldn't be working. The person at the register should know how to take orders in a timely manner, it took way too long.   The food: bland. The crispy chicken sandwich was crispy but absolutely no flavor. Did they skip on the Dijon? The presentation was there but that's it. Overpriced.   The nachos, I've had better. Barely any toppings compared to how many chips. For the price, at least add the toppings.  The green chili pot pie was spicy. One of the better dishes out of the three. The crust could be a bit more flakey.   Oh, you get your own water which they don't tell you. The ice machine was down so the ice was in a bucket melted. Having all utensils in a cup on the table is rather gross, who knows how many hands touch those things including kids. If you order a drink at the front they require two people for two drinks. Getting our drinks took the longest. Got them AFTER the food. $50 for bland, long wait to order food and drinks. I expect better.",

We are lacking local dining options in South Tempe, so I was excited to eat here and to fall in love with a new local restaurant in my backyard.  We arrived around 7pm the night before the grand opening. The place was packed and there was a private event on the patio. I didn't realize it is a order at the counter type of place but don't mind. The dinner entree selection is small, there are mostly pizza and sandwich options. We decided to try the soft pretzel and cheese appetizer, my friend got the chicken platter with mashed potatoes and spinach and I wanted to try the pork chile verde pot pie and threw in a grilled cheese. The pretzels were very thick almost like pretzel sandwich buns and had no salt. The cheese sauce was good although grainy. The chicken dinner was ok nothing to write home about. The pork chile verde pot pie was not good, the pork was very fatty and it was too spicy. The grilled cheese was not worth the price especially since there isn't even a side with it. The staff came by to check on how things were  but even after letting them know the issues they didn't seem to care. We spent over $40 and didn't have any drinks.  My excitement was short lived and unfortunately I don't really feel a need to go back. I'm sure this place will be busy for a while but with the Scottsdale prices and lacking food, will it last?",

SKIMPY portions yet high prices. $11.00 for a \"superfood\" salad in a soup bowl? Let me see, Literally 1 ounce of the following; Kale=cheap, Quinoa=cheap, Broccoli=cheap, Almonds=cheap, Sweet Potatoes=cheap, Avocado=OK I'll give you that one... Hey, that's worth $11.00! NO! Don't get me wrong, I love a healthy meal, but the opportune word here is meal, not snack.    The wife had the AZ burger. It too was $11.00 and then $4.00 for a 3\" bowl of fries. Yes. $4.00 for a CUP of fries. Have you ever been to 5 guys? Their small order of fries is $2.99 and more than enough to split. I know, not necessarily an accurate comparison, but again a very inexpensive item to produce. I digress. Back to the burger... The brioche bun was good. Did someone break in and steal ALL the spices? Bland is an understatement. By the way, my son had the kids cheeseburger. Same size as the AZ, patty, very little cheese, and bun. Half the price. Equally as bland. There were 2 pickles though...   Lastly, we ordered green tea, a cold brew iced coffee, and an espresso. The tea and iced were actually very good! Hence the second star. The espresso on the other hand was no joke the absolute worst we've ever had. Bitter, acidic and a mere sip for $2.50. Let me clarify, I make espresso every morning at home. We do not drink coffee. We know espresso. That was not espresso! That was just nasty.    In conclusion, bland, overpriced food. Good tea and cold brew. Horrible espresso. Good bread. I think they should scrap the menu (or at least half the cost of every item) or go exclusively baked goods. Buy some real coffee beans roasted by someone who's actually tasted good coffee. If you like this type of place/food, save yourself some money and go to Modern Market on Ray road. At least they feed you and there's some flavor...",

We loved the chorizo biscuits and gravy so much that one of us orders it each time, the other one orders something new so we explore the menu.  The blue corn pancake is amazing as it is flavorful yet not too sweet.  We have also ordered the Devils Mess and the Rooster Booster and both were very basic but fresh and tasty.  The pop tarts and bread are sooo good!   Now, for the reality.....the servers, although nice, need intense training. Two of the three times we were there we have had to ask for silverware and that was after our food had arrived.  During our visit today, the waiter put in the wrong order so we had to eat separately as one dish had to be sent back.  I ordered hot tea and was told I could put my teabag in the small cup and could get more hot water later.  When I looked in the cup I noticed it was not clean so I cleaned it with my napkin!  I had to ask the waiter for more hot water rather than the waiter realizing it was time for a refill.  My husband had water and never was he asked if he needed a refill - an yes, that has been the case at each visit.  Their attention to details has a lot to be desired, therefore the reason for 3 stars.  I'm hoping to repost soon with many more stars    To sum this up, we will continue to go back for awhile realizing this is a new business but we are hoping to see an increase in customer service very soon!",

We both ordered the fried chicken sandwich (no pizzas were available the night we went) with a side of french fries -- all of which was very tasty -- but we paid $32 plus tip for two chicken sandwiches, one order of french fries, and a can of Diet Coke.  I know the zeitgeist regarding the Cafe (\"We were forced to drive from south Tempe to Phoenix just to eat\") means we should've paid our bill of $32 plus tip and thanked the Cafe for granting us the opportunity to eat there, but, come on. The food is good but overpriced and there ARE plenty of restaurants in south Tempe that offer better value for food-buying dollars and more variety on their menus.",

    "text": "This is one of the few spots I've found in the Phoenix area that has a spacious enough atmosphere for those looking to gather with friends, take a rest from their work day, or get some work done over some delicious food. I saw people hanging at the bar, reading a book at spacious tables, and families sharing a meal. As someone who has trouble not procrastinating at home, I appreciated the ample outlets for recharging under every table. Most importantly, the food is amazing! I had the lentil curry coconut soup, the quiche, and the local pretzel because I'm a huge glutton and I will be going back to have them again! This is coming from someone who usually doesn't like to eat the same thing at any eatery twice in a row. I can't wait to go back",

    "text": "I'm so confused about why my experience seemed to be so bad compared to the other reviews. THE FOOD WAS AWFUL. I'm upset I wasted my money! I just do not understand. However, the service was good. The staff was very attentive.  The decor is nice, the patio very inviting, I liked all the plants and the huge fireplace. The inside was extremely noisy.   The menu sounds great, but unfortunately, the taste was quite the opposite. We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza, a Cubano sandwich, and a couple drinks... over $40 bucks.   The BBQ chicken pizza features chicken sausage, ok I can respect going out of the box, but the menu did not say chicken sausage. The pizzas are served in a rectangular baking pan which made the crust soggy, almost steamed like. I did not taste or see fresno chile or cilantro, I'm now wondering if they didn't complete our pizza. The BBQ sauce was ok, very sweet. Seriously, a frozen pizza is better.   The Cubano, wow it was ssssoooo bad. The pork was old and/or very overcooked, possibly microwaved. It had a strange taste to it and was gray and tough!!! There was a tiny amount of ham, like 1-2 slices, barely there cheese. It was mostly bread. This sandwich left you only tasting the mustard.  We were pressed for time and starving, so we had no choice but to eat the food, but I wish I would have sent it back and got a refund. Hopefully for others, they were having a bad night.  I will not return for the food, that's for sure.",

    "text": "Stopped in for dinner this past week with six other people. It was my sister's birthday and we were dying to try this place, so there were high expectations. The atmosphere is awesome, right off the bat. Inside the restaurant is open, airy, and has the feel of a True market. The patio is quite large and has a great vibe. The staff was genuinely friendly, helpful, and attentive! Kudos to them and their great attitudes!   A few of us ordered beer and wine, all of which was local: another plus! Prices were definitely fair for drinks. The food, however, is on the pricier side, but it's not anymore than you'd expect to pay at many other local or trendy spots.  Now the taste of the food - overall, it could be better. We were mildly disappointed with our meals. I had the pasta (I can't remember the name - it had a poblano cream sauce). It was alright, but was pretty severely lacking in seasoning. It could have used a bit of spice, garlic, or salt (and I never add salt to food!). Two in my group ordered the pork chile verde pot pie. On the smaller side, the chile was also surprisingly bland. A bummer for an Arizona restaurant. My dad had the Del Real sandwich, a vegetarian sandwich. It looked good, but was small and only came with a few grapes, and orange slice or two, and a few strawberries. Also a bummer for a $10 sandwich. The fried chicken was a huge plate, though. The pretzels were excellent.  I'd like to give this place another try, since the hype is so big. But hopefully the food will actually have some seasoning next time, otherwise the ambiance isn't worth the price alone.",

Regardless of the line and the abnormally long wait to get my lunch. The food was amazing! I got the fried chicken sandwich and butternut squash soup. I have to say that the chicken sandwich was the best I have ever had! I will be going back soon, just not during lunch.",

Long story short, after they moved on from the staff member I had a negative experience with, that guy messaged me on Yelp and harassed me. Not a big deal, more funny than anything. I wanted to bring this to Brent and Jayme's attention because obviously he represented their business.  After speaking with them and learning, through Brent, that the same ownership group who owned Tempe Public Market also owned Ghost Ranch (which is next door to them) and St. Francis (one of my favorite restaurants ever) I decided to take Brent and Jayme up on their offer to give this place another shot.  Much more pleasant experience with the staff on the second go round, seriously the enjoy vibe of this place changed from my initial visit. You can tell the feedback Brent and Jayme have received from me, as well as other customers has been taken seriously and changes have been implemented.  On this latest visit I decided to try the pizza, I went with The Rancher. I must say that this pizza is pretty damn amazing. It is my second favorite pizza that I've ever had in Phoenix metro (LGO still has the best but this is stiff competition). The pizza is a rectangular shape, was cooked perfectly and honestly might be enough for two people (I could only eat half of it).   I cannot wait to try more things (I'm thinking one of the house made bowls next time).   Thank you Brent and Jayme for reaching out to me, thank you for listening to my concerns and not taking them as an attack on your business. You clearly take pride in what you do here, which is very on brand for an Aaron Chamberlain restaurant. I will be back!",

The ice machine was broke so there was a tray of ice with a scoop and we were there long enough to need the restrooms. One was empty, no paper towels the entire time we were there.

I came in yesterday for a working lunch, and ordered the lentil curry coconut soup and a side of fries. I was most looking forward to the fries, as they'd always been great on previous visits (and at the Phoenix Public Market Cafe).   When my plate was set down, I was immediately disappointed. Gone we're the good, thicker-cut and skin-on fries, and in their place was a bowl of pale shoestring fries that looked as if they came out of a bag from Ore-Ida. The soup wasn't great either - somewhat watery, unwieldy big chunks of potato, and unevenly cut fresh ginger (some pieces tiny and cooked through and other pieces large and crunchy and inedible).  I was so excited about this location when it first opened, but I'd have to think twice about stopping in again.",

Order at the counter, get your number and they bring it to you, good size bar, seating inside with just rows of tables and an extensive outside patio area for seating.  Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie - House baked in a flaky crust filled with chucks of pork in a medium hot chile verde stew. I would say this may be their signature dish. I had this at the Phoenix Public Market and loved it as I did here.  The Rancher Pizza - Schreiner's sausage, pepperoni, cheese blend, house made tomato sauce, good combination of ingredients on a good pizza dough cooked just right.  AZ Burger - green chile, cheddar, lettuce, house dressing, good generous size burger served with fries, that all the ingredients work well together.  House Pretzels with jalapeno white cheddar sauce. Fresh handmade pretzels that are delicious.  All the food is well prepared and seem very fresh and good quality.  No wait on a Thursday evening with plenty of seating inside and outside of the restaurant with a few monitors but not over bearing like a sports bar.  Enjoyed the experience and would definitely come back again.",

If you haven't been in recently go and check it out, they did a fantastic remodel on the entire restaurant. The decor, food, and drinks are all outstanding. Yes some things have changed but it's all for the best, the new dishes and cocktails are fantastic. If you haven't been yet go and check it out you won't regret it.   My favorite part is the fact that they've gone full service for dinner and brunch, if you live in the So Tempe area you know this was greatly needed, who doesn't like having a server while relaxing on the patio after a long day of work, I know I do.   One last thing, they offer happy hour all day, from 11am to 7pm, that's huge I know of very few places that offer this kind of drink deals in the valley.",

I had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes salad and dessert, which was soft-serve vanilla with sprinkles on it.   The chicken was good but a little on the greasy side. I was however delighted that there was a kale salad served with it that wasn't mentioned on the menu.  I thought the service was good and liked the atmosphere. It's impossible not to compare this with the downtown Phoenix location, which has a pulse of its own and is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. But, if you're not familiar with their food and in the East Valley, it's well worth trying this place out and it's likely to become one of your favorites.  Note: The patio has misters.",

I usually get the sangria because their other cocktail on special is spicy (I just can't get into spicy cocktails, not my thing). I have tried a few food items that are also just fine, but not worth going out of your way to get. Their pizzas look decent, so I would like to try those and their baked goods aren't bad either.  I know they are going through renovation and a change in ownership, so maybe it will be better in the near future.",

It was such a beautiful day and the patio was quite enjoyable.   We were served right away and the cashier was efficient and personable. Our food came out quickly in spite of the crowd. This was impressive as I expected our food to take much longer.  Good job here. I thought the food was on the pricey side, however.   I enjoyed a slice of the quiche and a latte. It quiche was pretty good, but the slice was on the smallish side. It came with a side salad which was very good. The dressing was light and tasty. My latte was the perfect temperature and I enjoyed it. The best part of all was the company of course. If I'm going to enjoy time with friends in a nice atmosphere, here is where I'd go.   When I return next, I'd like to try the breakfast options and will plan to update my review then.",

The person who took our order was either annoyed or maybe the music was too loud but I didn't get a welcome feeling.   My husband ordered a burger. Not bad but not overwhelmingly great. The bun was yummy though.   I ordered a grilled cheese and seriously... ANYWHERE makes a better grilled cheese. The bread was dry. The cheese was barely there. And there wasn't any flavor. I ate half. Tried to share some with my kiddo who was not interested at all... And finished off my husband's burger. The price for the grilled cheese is ridiculous especially when THAT was what I got. I was really excited and was super disappointed.   The fries were decent. Not worth the  $4 side charge though. We ate maybe half each.   My husband told the manager I guess (?) About the sandwich and he didn't offer any solutions or obviously have any knowledge on what to even say. We aren't mean or throw fits. But we do expect quality when the cost is is this tier.  The macaroon was AMAZING though. So there's that.  I don't think we will be back.",

Since Tempe, is seriously lacking good places to eat,we were very excited to check this place out. If you are on your lunch hour at work forget it ,you will never get your food and get out on time. 30 min we waited for our order. The place is very crowded,but, mostly with people that are waiting for their food,for a very long time. We came a little after 1pm,thinking the rush would be over. I know that they just opened recently. It seems as if there is a lot of folks working here that maybe have not worked in a restaurant before. What might help is if they take orders at the table. Watching the staff run all around the place,inside and outside while looking for the table for the the number  has to be exhausting!  They have been open for a few weeks now. So they should be getting it together.We will give it another try, but it will be awhile.",

The grilled ham and cheese, however, was very good.    Would have ordered additional drinks but there wasn't a server in site.    Best part of our visit:  there were some damn cute dogs in the patio.  We really want this place to make it.

She was happy with her food, but the rest of us?  I wasn't feeling super hungry, so when we each placed our orders, I asked for the pretzels with cheese and a side of bacon. What came out was a stale, stiff, bland hunk of bread, with a melted puddle of flavorless Velveeta. As for the side of bacon? They crunched up a bit and put it the cheese.  Half our orders came out 20 minutes late, too. When they finally delivered the pizza, it too was boring and flavorless. We put it in a to-go box on the off chance that maybe it would make a decent 2am snack if it was smothered in enough condiments to make you forget what you were eating. It didn't.  Oh, then there's the layout. Given the location, they have a huge amount of real estate, but the out door area is primarily unused space, with too few tables. What's more, half the tables don't even have chairs! People standing around holding their plates of food, which grow cold waiting for a place to sit...  On top of that, the entrance is arranged in a matter that the line to the bathroom and the line to order are the same thing, creating confusion and disorganization. The icing on top of that cupcake is that you can't even see the menu until you're about to order!  I've never left a bad review before in my life, but this place absolutely sucked and I'll definitely not be returning, especially if their social media manager replies with the exact same canned message that's been sent to other reviewers instead of actually addressing the glaring issues with their service and quality of food.",

    "text": "I was so stoked to have Tempe Public Market Cafe open so close to me - only 2 miles away! Hooray! South Tempe/West Chandler are really lacking local restaurants with nice patios, indoor/outdoor spaces and local fare.  So, when TPMC finally opened, I was pumped! Hooray! Let's do this! Well.. I guess that I have to say - so far - I have been let down.  I went to get out of my house on a nice day, to use the wifi and grab a bite for lunch. I had a coupon for a free cookie as it was opening week, so was happy to use that. I looked over the menu and finally decided I am going to do the chicken sandwich. Ok. Well to start - the prices here (well at least for the fries) are more expensive than the downtown location. I have already choked at the $3 that was being charged in addition to the sandwich downtown because these are \"full-service\" restaurant prices with no service. But $4 for fries? Ug. Hard pass. On with the chicken sandwich.  Presentation-wise the sandwich is beautiful. Nice big hunk of golden-brown battered chicken on bun with some slaw an pickles. Looks delicious. Cutting the sandwich in half - the chicken is juicy. Now - on to the flavor. Wait - what flavor? The chicken was juicy, the breading crispy - but there is zero flavor in the breading. Zero flavor in the beautiful slaw. The only thing that made this have flavor was the butter pickles. Completely disappointed.   Well, suffice to say - the cookie was the same. I am one of those strange people that likes the dough better than the chocolate in chocolate chip cookies, and once again, there was zero flavor in the dough. Just completely missing something. As I am desperate for an awesome bakery like LGO around here to offer some semblance of a delicious baked good, neither the flavor, nor the size of the cookie suffices in comparison.  Service - well, I sat at the bar, and the staff seems very young and green. A bit clueless I have to say - drinks empty, no silverware delivered, no question of how my food was - asked for drink refills and silverware, finally ended up reaching over the bar and getting the silverware myself. Had to ask a second time for refill. Observation is not their skill set as of yet. Had to flag them down again for a box - twice.  The space itself - inside and out is beautiful. I love the patio - just needs more chairs - or tables at the long bench behind the bar. I am wondering what will happen come summer with the west side of the patio being unshaded, but so far, so good. Great patio space for sure.   So, once again for now, I will continue to my non-local (anymore) Four Peaks for delicious food, beverages, patio, and service as I have yet to be impressed by TPMC. I'm sure I will go again sometime in the future, but for now - I am going to go where I get an all-around better experience for the money.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Public Market Cafe; I almost never make it out to Tempe anymore but on opening weekend my friend and I decided to check it out! When I first got in there, it was so busy that a staff member came up to me and asked, \"Are you looking for someone?\"  And I said, \"Yes, my friend...\" scanning the room.  And she said, \"Is it Michelle?\"  And I'm like, \"No, Andrea...\"  I guess I wasn't the only one lost and confused amidst the buzzing of the crowd. No, seriously! I only told this tidbit of a story because that's how freakin' packed it was. It was the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday and the line snaked out the door.  I finally found my friend and we stood in line. 15 minutes passed...then 30...then 45! Yes, my dear Yelp friends, I stood in line for 45 minutes for food, something I only ever do if food is amazing. When we were finally helped, we both ordered Pancho Villa juices, which had jalepeno and pineapple in them. I ordered the Chile Pork Verde Pot Pie, a house specialty and my friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. The Chile Pork Verde Pot Pie tasted good, it had large chunks of pork in them and a good kick to it. My friend reported her spicy chicken sandwich tasted amazing and was worth the wait. We were both happy with our spicy jalepeno green juices, too! Overall, I love the space of the place; I wish that Phoenix Public Market Cafe was as big as this one, it was so relaxing to finally sit outside in the sunshine and enjoy our food. I can't say I'll be back to this location because I live way closer to the Phoenix one, but I could see how this could be a chill place to come and relax -hopefully not with a 45 minute wait on opening weekend!",

Service was average at best, the order up was horribly slow and I really felt like I was at a McDonalds. My last time there, 4 people in front of me in line, 7:30, not that busy and it too 10-15 in line to order. Not good! Food came out normal time, but both times I've orders different items, and both times not impressed with the food, average at best, no real flare to anything and the it was quite costly, I guess they have to pay for all the renovations some how.  Sorry guys, Not going to make it a third time.",

Because the menu offers both a cup a bowl size serving I made sure to ask the person taking my order to show me the difference before I placed my order. I was so excited to see how big a BOWL was and couldn't wait!! Unfortunately, I was beyond DISAPPOINTED When my soup came to the table. I couldn't believe how little soup actually comes in a \"BOWL.\" I called over a service person who took the soup back and brought me a new bowl.  To my shock It was exactly the same amount as before! This time the server told me that it's a 10 oz serving to a bowl compared to a 6 oz in a cup.  My suggestion would be to maybe serve the \"bowl\" sized serving in a smaller bowl so you don't feel like you're serving a cup size but just in a bowl.  That being said, the soup was great! This picture is of the bowl before I took my first bite!",

I got a sangria, chips and salsa (with came with three types of dips), wings for $18! What a deal! FYI: happy hour is until 7 pm, which I appreciate as it's next to impossible to even make the few happy hour venues that end at 6 pm.  Let's talk about the venue. Does anyone need an escape? This place made you forget you had a 10-hr day. A+ on the ambiance!  All in all, great service, yummy food, and amazing deals! I'm definitely coming back.",

Over the last couple of months- I've been 4 times in a attempt to give it a fair shot.   The decor and seating is an improvement. Decor is so fun!   The food is still hit or miss. You'll either get really awesome fresh french fries or awful stale packets of grease- there's no in between.   The service is still lacking on attentiveness and promptness. Asking for a refill or a set of silverware can be painful. Each time I've had to ask for forks & knives and every time the server or manager has instructed me to look in the silver canister on the table for more forks (they were empty I already checked). Please don't instruct your customers on where to find them- I've already looked, that's why I'm asking you.   The superfood salad is always good (as long as the sweet potatoes aren't nasty with brown spots). Again- I love the fries as long as their fresh. It's up to you to determine when the fries will be served properly or nasty re-fried leftovers. The pizza has been consistently burned on the bottom. In general there is a lack of attention to details (supply levels on the table, cleanliness, refills and seasoning).   We may try again in a few months.",

I had their Chino salad which essentially is a Chinese chicken salad with a ginger dressing that I found very bitter. Probably wouldn't order this again because of all the Napa cabbage but, that's my fault. The menu clearly states the ingredients.   This is my 4th or 5th visit and I still love this spot. Newly decorated and quite different seating which I liked.   I had the Asian salad with chicken $16, quite delicious, but maybe a bit over-dressed for my liking.

Three of us sat at the bar on a Friday afternoon about 2:00 or so and were 'helped' by a snotty brat with absolutely zero customer service skills.   I was the unfortunate one who got to sit underneath a giant speaker it was so loud that I could barely hear my friends talking so I asked the 'gentleman' if he would please turn it down a little. He generously agreed to turn it down a bit but made sure to let me know 'that if they got busy, he would have to turn it back up'.   It was all I could do not to laugh because there was maybe 3 tables in the whole place.  My friend and I both ordered the goat cheese cucumber sprouts sandwich, the del rel or something like that and what we got was two completely different sandwiches. Mine was dry, stale and gross. The cucumbers were curling from being old, the sprouts weren't fresh the bread was stale... all bad. Fries were old and cold... Ughhh.   We were absolutely ignored the entire time. I had to loudly ask for a refill as the little brat played on his phone.   It felt like he thought we weren't good enough to be in there or something. I haven't been treated that way for I really, really long time. I almost wanted to say 'yeah, I don't have makeup on and I am wearing yoga pants but it's my day off!'   Whatever, it was just a terrible Vibe. Will people continue to pay $9 for a crappy glass of wine and ear overpriced sub par food? Peace out.   Should be out of business shortly. Hopefully Postino's will go in there!!! That would be awesome!!!",

The food is okay but average. The coffee pot is self-serve and difficult to get to, and every time I've been in, it has been empty. It is difficult to track someone down who can take care of it, which leaves customers feeling like nobody is running the place.  They are also militant about their 11 am cut-off between breakfast and lunch. When I came in with a friend, they refused to even put her lunch order into their system because it was 3 minutes before 11 am. We understood if they weren't going to fill it for a few minutes, but they would not even take the order. They also made it clear that they wouldn't let us wait at the register for a few extra minutes in order to follow their rigid rules. They wanted us to move out of the way so that the people behind us could order. If we wanted to eat, we would have to go to the back of the line and start over again just so that we could time it absolutely perfectly. This was astoundingly bad customer service.  The best thing about Tempe Public Market is the architecture and design. It has definitely elevated the coolness in this south suburb strip mall! It is also a good place for meeting someone if you want a little bit of space to spread out. Unfortunately, the parts that matter most - the food and the customer service - consistently fall short.",

I was hoping that with the recent split from the Phoenix locations, Dave Chamberlin would overhaul the food. I was glad to see \"Taste the Rainbow\" is gone and there's a veggie udon dish now.   There are good food and drink specials from 3-7 PM. A few draft beers are $4 and select apps are $7.  Unfortunately, I didn't really like anything we ate. This has been pretty much True for me at all Chamberlin establishments. I get other people must like the food because they're doing fine, but it's just not my thing.  We got the Cauliflower Wings, a cheese pizza, and two beers. The panko crust on the cauliflower was nice and crunchy. I don't know if our order was put out wrong but there was nothing spicy--no wing sauce. The dipping sauce wasn't quite blue cheese or ranch and was just kind of blah.  The cheese pizza was just not great--the crust was somewhere between crispy and soft, the sauce was tangy but not flavorful. I just feel like at this price point the food should be better or, you know, good.   I'll stop in for a beer, but I think I'm kind of over the food.",

Ghost ranch restaurant was right next door and we originally wanted to go there, but they didn't have an open patio for my pooch, so we opted for this cafe.   Positives: 1. Inside seating as well as a huge open patio with plenty of seating. 2. Good-sized menu with a variety of options. 3. Four or more clean unisex bathrooms.  4. Tasteful design with a chill & relaxing atmosphere.   Now, let's get down to the nitty gritty. This is an order ur food at the counter kind of place. They were out of ice by the time we got our water, which wasn't a terrible thing cuz we got to the restaurant 40 min before closing, but the water tasted pretty funky. Maybe I'm just too used to the taste of bottled water. Yes, shame on me!!   Got the two entrees listed below and the Tito's cubano sandwich was the better of the two. It had good flavor and was even better when dipped in the horseradish sauce that it came with. The fries were limp & soggy. Not a good combination. Some things may be ok soggy, but limp, NEVER!!!   The superfood salad lacked flavor in every way, so I know it was very healthy, but definitely not worth $20!  Overall, this was a 3 star experience as the waitress was very nice and provided my pooch with a large bowl of ice cold water! How does a 4 legger get better treatment than the 2 leggers??? Guess I won't be back here til I grow 2 more legs!!!",

    "text": "I came in for brunch today. Based upon my reviews I think brunch is my favorite meal. They open at 7 and I got there around 7:30 so it was not very busy at all which I enjoyed. On the weekends they do table service so see the host to be sat. Service was fairly good, didn't have too much interaction with my server. I ordered an iced chai, pretty good, very sweet. They had many coffee options as well as a full bar. There was a good amount of options on the menu. I went with the grits which had braised pork, two eggs and toast. On their own the grits were pretty flavorless. No butter or even salt. But they were good with the pork. The texture of the grits was really good though. The interior of the restaurant was really cute. Would be a fun place to meet up with some girlfriend and grab a meal and maybe some drinks",

The place has an interesting vibe and is noisy. Most of the (self-seating) tables were taken by 11:30. Food is ordered at the counter and brought out to you. I'm fine with that. Menu-wise, they appear to have something for everyone.  Due to noise level, this would be a great place for kids. But not the place if you really want to enjoy conversation with your dining companion(s).  On our way out, we grabbed a couple of chocolate chunk cookies to go (they have a great looking bakery case). I mean, c'mon! We're not heathens.",

Josh really took his time crafting the beverages to ensure they come out picture perfect, and mentioned that he would also be willing to make custom drinks not featured on the menu. The restaurant manager also took the time to follow up with us to ensure we had a great experience while we were there. Five Star service from both Josh and Forbes!

    "text": "We ate here a few months ago and the food was delicious, the wait was nonexistent, and the prices were reasonable. At the time, the restaurant was seat-yourself, order and pay at the register, but now you must wait to be seated, wait to have your order taken, and wait to pay. The menu on the wall (which had more (and better) options) is no longer available.  The cocktail we had was called something like The Tempe Fizz. I assumed it would be at least lightly carbonated - wrong. The flavor was lackluster, and the ice inside the wine glass made the drink difficult to consume (I had to grab straws from the bar because our server took so long to come back).   I had the green chili pork pot pie. The server said it was very delicious and a little spicy. Not only was there no spice, but it had a funky taste that I can only describe as \"old\". The puff pastry on top was delicious, though! Kiddo had a pepperoni pizza - probably best meal anyone had! The pizza was really yummy, and the giant pepperonis were crispy and full of flavor! The other person in our party had the crispy chicken sandwich. It was spicy, but the sandwich had so much sauce and salad mix on it that it wasn't able to be eaten by hand, and they had to use silverware. Their side salad was also overdressed.   If you try this place, stick to a pizza at the bar and drink something you already enjoy on tap or canned/bottled. The pizza was by far the best portion of this meal!",

I am seriously disappointed with their new menu and the quality of food. I think the new menu try too hard to put super food in everything in a weird way. The dishes are designed in a combination of sweet and salty things. Because I am out of choices of more of a \"normal\" American food that is more like the ones you will get from a farmer's market, I ordered a safe choice. Kids grill cheese sandwich. Oh my goodness is it hard to chew! They also managed to burn a kids cheese pizza. My husband's nobel cristal is also hard to \"saw\" through, literal you can't cut through it. My daughter ordered a crispy chicken breast ( not crispy) and comes with no ketchup or any dipping sauce. It is dry and chewy.   Not coming back. I am sad to lose this neighborhood restaurant. Used to love it.",

We also literally had to go to bar to get another drink. Talked to manager after and she actually said it was her fault for not paying attention to her staff because she was busy in the back. What!!!

When we visited the place it had lots of staff running looking busy helping the 4 tables of customers for the 10 plus staff.  It might take you 15 minutes to order your food as your server is probably too busy discussing  how many people should we have standing at the front of the restaurant.   What about the food? Let's start with a cold brew then add cream and cinnamon syrup.   This turned out to be a glass of cream with a splash of coffee and with the hint of someone eating cinnamon a few states away.  The chicken quesadilla: imagine it is 3 in the morning and you returned home desperate for something to eat. You take some boiled chicken breast with no seasoning and all of the cheese you have in the house and put it in tortilla.  Melt it and enjoy that disappointment.   Overall, hard pass.",

It was busy but not crazy. Two groups in front of us - group of 4 and group of 6.... It took 25 minutes to take their orders...I wish I was kidding.   While we were waiting I hopped over to the bar to grab a beer. Beer selection is sad. Who doesn't carry Dos Equis lager? Also, the hefeweizen here is probably my least favorite one. The bar staff was okay if that means you have to ask for a glass and an orange wedge, also I'd suggest not tossing the receipt and pen at your customers ( or anyone that you've just met for that matter).   We grabbed a seat and waited.. and waited. Our food took about 45 minutes to arrive. I ordered the special pizza on the board margarita and my dinner date had a burger.   My pizza looked like the kitchen is either a. lazy b. Ran out of food or c. The restaurant is loosing money. Heirloom tomatoes are wonderful however not when they are the cherry variety and cut in half. That nice mushy seed guts all over is not appetizing. I also found it strange that instead of slicing the basil it was thrown whole leaves randomly on top (a whole 4 leaves). Just yuck. Sadly it was also close to flavorless. The whole thing missed it's mark.  My dinner dates burger was not cooked to the requested color and served with room temp fries. He asked for the green chilies on the side... They were served cold.   Also as mentioned in other reviews here the staff looks lost and wonders around. This place needs some serious intervention!! Someone save it!! It's so cute on the inside and the patio looks lovely!! Maybe just bring a packed meal?",

We live in the neighborhood and walk over and can easily find a seat now we enjoy their happy hour and service at the bar, instead of going to the cash register to order. We like the full service. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the limited menu, and prices. We normally split a salad and an entree between the two of us and the portions are just right by sharing. Last night we had the ginger Asian salad and the New York strip steak with mashed potatoes. It was very good and I would order it again. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. The bartender was our waiter/server and he was very friendly. We will be back!",

    "text": "2 stars for the wait and cold food on a carry-out order.  Do not attempt to order pizza along with other hot food items.  They will be cold by the time you get home and I live down the street from them.  My daughter decided to grab a carry-out around 8pm this past Friday.  I ordered Friday's pizza special, Margherita, Sun Devil Fries and a ballerina cookie; my daughter ordered the fried chicken.Paid and sat down near the ice machine.  About 15 minutes later, a carry-out (bagged)   order was dropped off on the counter next to the machine, there were 2-3 staffers standing near by; looked at it but didn't pick it up nor call out any numbers.  Another 5 mins went by and WE were wondering if that was our order but it was missing the pizza.  A full 25 mins went by before the staffer that took our order also gave us the same bag (that was sitting there) with the pizza.  We left, the pizza was warm/hot but not the chicken or the fries by the time we got home.  We had to re-heat both.  This must be something the kitchen hasn't figured out the timing when a pizza is order with other food.  I was there with a group of friends during opening night and 2 pizzas were order, they came out about 20 minutes AFTER the rest of the table received their food.  While I can excuse this happening on open night because it was crazy busy, it's 4 months later and the kitchen logistics should've worked out all the kinks.     Why didn't we go back--we were too tired that night.    Two things that annoyed me: 1.  It  wasn't busy and the none of the 2-3 staffers hanging around the ice machine took the initiative to ask the kitchen WHEN the pizza was going to be ready or thought to return the rest of the order back to the kitchen because it would be cold.  2.  If the kitchen knows it takes the 20-25 minutes for the pizza, why would  the rest of the kitchen fill the rest of the order and have it sit on the counter getting cold and soggy?  I hope the managers fixes this problem. The cookie was great, though.",

I came back this morning to try their coffee bar, WOW! Absolutely delicious! Staff was super friendly, latte was far less $$$ than some of those chain spots. Coffee is also local from Tucson. Check this spot out, you won't be disappointed.",

Seems like everything these days needs to be \"NUEVO-FUSION\" what have you, just to be different, rather than what Chile was originally intended to be. Why should green Chile be laden with Cumin, or other misplaced spices? Also, the pie was far from flaky and moist, and was probably sitting around. Tortillas and Mexican Coca Cola was good.",

The inside seating just feels too casual for what you'd sort of expect for a place with a nice bar.  The bartenders are a bit inattentive. I've sat at the bar for over 10 minutes waiting to order. More than once. I'm patient but they make me feel a bit invisible as they rush around and wait on others around me. On my first visit I got very excited as parts of Tempe Public Market somewhat resembles Windsor. Unfortunately the menu is much simpler and it's nothing like Windsor. The quiche is pretty good, not great but ok. Other than that I've only had a Caesar salad. There just isn't much on the menu that I'd want to eat. I was hoping they'd expand the menu once they were opened for a bit but so far that hasn't happened. Dear Tempe Public Market - please expand your menu and cocktail list! You need more appetizer options.  also, not that this is a bad thing - but this really seems to be more of a family oriented restaurant. There are a lot of kids on the patio area. For me, I just prefer a more relaxing atmosphere without kids running around - although I'd fully deal with this if there were better food options and friendlier bartenders.",

An add-on of fries or a salad should not be $4 when just the sandwich costs 10.50, $2 would be more appropriate, but whatever.  Also, the flies are ridiculous. They are flying all over the food and desserts. I don't know what can be done about it but it's gross man.   The seating in this place is nearly communal. Half inside and half outside. What the heck are they going to do in the summer? They will lose half of their seating as there is no way anyone can sit outside, especially with the poor overhead coverage.  Parking overall is poor as it's limited. It's going to get worse when Ghost Ranch opens next door.",

The line took 45 minutes to get through, and then our food took another 30 minutes to get to the table. When the kids cheeseburger and the adult grilled cheese that we ordered came to our table, they were cold and both looked like kids plates. I asked the server if this was the adult grilled cheese or the kids grilled cheese and he responded \"they're the exact same\". For the price difference, I feel like the adult grilled cheese should be bigger and better than the kids right?! It really was a sub par grilled cheese too. I could've saved myself $12 and made one at home. They only had one option for ice tea during the lunch rush, and no one had any idea if a kids meal included a drink. I had to go through three employees before I got an answer and they weren't even confident that it did. There are a lot of options for lunch in the area, I will not be returning!",

Outside tables are facing the wrong direction so sun was directly in your face. Tried to order a decaf coffee but they don't have it. Who doesn't serve decaf options these days? Ordered the frittata which was tasty but definitely not a frittata- an open omelet with the filling on top. Got a coupon for a free pop tart which was appreciated but the girl tried to serve one which was burnt but did replace it when I asked. Server was helpful to start getting us water and utensils. Friend's coffee was slopped into saucer. Glad we asked for real cups otherwise you get a paper cup, appears no refills. I know we sat a long time talking but got the distinct feeling from the server that he wanted us to move on. I doubt I will be back, sorry, it was not inspiring.",

The line wasn't too long but still took a while since the people in front of us could not make up their mind and there was only one of the two registers open on a Saturday night. I ordered the pot pie which was delicious and a side of crispy sweet potatoes. When they delivered our food they brought me a baked sweet potato.   I told him I ordered the crispy potatoes and he said that's what this is.  I know what a baked potato looks like, a little more training is needed here apparently.  I made him take it back to get the crispy sweet potatoes and he brought the baked potato back stating they don't serve crispy sweet potatoes at night. What! Then why is it on the menu and why did that gal at the register not tell me that?  My husband ordered the superfood salad with chicken and of course it came out with no chicken and very small.  Also it is a little expensive for the area. Great happy hour prices though, we might be back for happy hour but not for dinner.",

The food on this last visit was really underwhelming and not what I had experienced before.  Both the pizza and the nachos were both lacking cheese, as if the kitchen was running really low and rationing what they had.  The nachos consisted of a huge plate of chips with black beans dumped in a pile the middle and a small bit of guac and diced tomato.  On a previous visit they had more generous toppings, including cheese.  Overall a nice place to hang with friends but in my opinion the food does not warrant the high prices.

    "text": "Not safe for Celiacs!  Having Celiac Disease I have to be careful about where I eat out.  Seeing lots of identified gluten free choices on the online menu I thought I could give it a try.  We took several gals there for my sister's birthday.  As we finally got through the line to order (and this took a LONG time) the manager informed us that the identified gluten free nachos (and fries) were fried in oil that other gluten containing food was also fried in.  Therefore they were cross contaminated.  I thought this was very short sighted menu labeling.  I told him whenever I see a fried food labeled gluten free I assume it is fried in a dedicated fryer.  As I tried to choose another gluten free meal the manager expressed concern that they do pizzas and have flour flying in the air and that the lines are very prone to cross-contamination.  We talk it through and I decided to try the chicken and mashed potato dish (labeled at gluten free).  He gave specific instructions to the kitchen to be careful when preparing.  It was very tasty but alas, I awoke in the night to a stomach ache and some nausea and have had some issues this morning.  If I had to guess, I'd say I was glutened.  They definitely need to revamp the menu, removing some gluten free labels and adding the obligatory \"eat at your own risk\" statements saying they have heavily glutened food prep area.  I will definitely not be eating here again (which is sad as the environment is great and the Prickly Pear Tea is fabulous).  Thankfully Picasso's is up the road and offers a totally safe eating experience.    All that said, I have to say the manager was extremely kind and concerned about getting things right.  I fully realize that I took a risk eating there and do not fault them for my getting sick...I understood the situation and decided to do it anyway.  The manager comped the difference between the nachos and chicken dinner and really tried to help me out.  But I did want to inform other Celiacs or those with bad gluten allergies that this is not the place for you.  I trust that the management will also get more serious about having their menu reflect that they are not safe for such people.",

There was no service at all besides a few bussers walking around. Just a giant line you have to stand in just to order your food and for the price that is ridicoulous. I even had to get my own drinks. The ice machine was out and they had a little bucket with a little scoop to scoop your own ice. Thats very unsanitary. When we told the staff about what happened, they simply said \"sorry that happened and I will tell the chef to look for the bones next time.\" Really?? Good drink deals but I can not see myself spending money here again.",

No options for those who don't want a carby meal.  Yes, I know you can order it without bread and potatoes but, you have to pay for them anyway so it would be nice to have at least one option for those who don't eat all the heavy carbs.  I ordered the Devils Mess (without the tortilla) and despite the fact that it had chorizo, chilis and salsa, it was really lacking flavor.  It had heat, don't get me wrong, but heat doesn't equal flavor.  Plus, mine was supposed to come with spinach and I only had 3 leaves of spinach.  Overall it was bland.  It really could have used some cheese or sour cream to cut the heat.  My daughter had the breakfast burrito and again just thought it was meh.  Not much flavor, large pockets of cheese that wasn't evenly distributed throughout the burrito.  The coffee was ok.  It was towards the end of the self serve carafe so it wasn't as warm as it should have been.  I think the food was was too expensive for what you got - $27 for two for breakfast that was just so so is too much for me.  And, it's seriously loud in the restaurant.  We ate inside - not sure if outside was quieter but, inside, we could barely talk to each other it was so loud.  Probably won't be back.",

    "text": "We've been anxiously awaiting TPM to open for over a year now, as we love the Phoenix location and constantly go out of our way for meals at St. Francis. To have that caliber of restaurant within walking distance would be great, right?! If it weren't for the name, you would never guess this place has anything in common with the other two. We've gone for breakfast twice now, and walked away extremely disappointed both times. We've never had to battle the long lines everyone else mentions, so this review is just on the layout and food. Our service there has actually been ok, as well. First, let people know that they need to grab silverware and water themselves, regardless of where they're sitting. It seems minor, but literally every person can be heard muttering under their breath at that counter that they should have been told to do it in the first place. Second: what genius decided to stick the coffee right in the corner of the front entrance, right where the most packed location in the entire restaurant is? There's never room to maneuver to get coffee, and the waiters never seem to see if it needs to be refilled. I've had to flag down a waiter on each visit to let them know they were out. Third: flies. Seriously, figure it out already. It was bad on the first visit, and worse on the 2nd. Multiple other reviews list the same thing- we actually moved outside the second visit to escape the flies. Fourth: the breakfast menu had no imagination or execution. Some things were good, like the biscuits and gravy and the corn cake, but not near worth the prices charged. The rest of the menu is unbelievably bland. When you have 2 kids push away their food and ask if we can go somewhere else like Oink, First Watch or Crepe Bar, you have serious problems. You simply can't justify the prices with the food being put out. We'll probably give it another try because it's so new, but to say we're disappointed is an understatement.",

    "text": "Came here on Friday night for the first time. The place was done really well. The patio is awesome. The major flaw with this place is the service style. You order at the counter and tables are first come first serve. This posses many problems. First off people are lurking everywhere to snag the first table that opens up. It is wierd to have people just standing around trolling for your table. The next issue is good luck getting anything else for you table such as dessert or drinks. You have to go stand in line at the bar to get drinks. No service at the tables. This format would be great for lunch, but for dinner they really need to switch to the traditional host/server model. The food was good. Pizza was just ok. Kids cheeseburger came with no cheese. Good luck getting mayo or mustard. The fried chicken was really good. The best I have had in a while. We will give this place another chance just for the patio and fried chicken.",

There was only one cashier and like 10 people standing behind her on the food line. There was also one other person drying silverware but no other cashiers. My friend and I ordered separately to save a table so between my half hour and her half hour to wait in line, we didn't eat for an hour. By the time we could sit down together her food was sitting there while she waited for me to get my food. She ordered a bowl of soup that was literally gone in 4 bites. I thought she had already starting eating when I sat down but no it was just the smallest bowl of soup--not a cup of soup. My salad had a dressing on the side  that I think equaled a tablespoon. All in all we were both disappointed and agreed it was a terrible experience!",

After being ignored for long periods of time we attempted to close our tab at the bar we asked the busser to close our tab because the bartender was too busy hitting on girls to help us out. In order to speed the process up we tried to give the busser a credit card to pay instead of getting the bill first. He walked over to the register and day we couldn't give him the card. So I said \"Hey bud!\" to get his attention. Surprisingly, this was the first time all night the bartender looked over to us. He had some look of annoyance in his face when he heard me. The bartender asked me if I was talking to him or the busser. Obviously, I was talking to the busser because that was the only person helping me at all. Then the bartender asked me how old I am and then he told me that he was 28. I'm not sure why, and I can't keep up with all the things that offend the worst generation in history, but then he had the God damn audacity to tell me I was rude. I said ok because I'm not going to argue with am underachieving 28 year old bartender. I'm sure when calling someone \"Bud\" started bothering the snowflakes but I don't give a shit. I hope they fire that bartender and I'll make sure to visit again to have a follow up with the worst bartender in the country.",

We were greeted upon arrival and were told that the outdoor seating was open, so we grabbed a table (we were there a bit before the crowds that came later).  What they failed to tell us was that you had to go to the bar to order your drinks.  The 'wait' staff that was milling about outside was not able to take any orders.    When I went to the bar to order my drinks, it was quite the wait (remember that I was there early).  I ordered our drinks, but when I wanted to place a food order, I was informed that I had to go inside, to the counter that was 5 feet from where I was standing, to place the food order.  Again, a line.    In all, I spent roughly 15-20 minutes away from the folks I was there with, simply trying to place an order.    I had to repeat this process every time we needed refills on our drinks.  I also had to repeat this process again when we were ready to go and I needed to close out my tab.  In all, we were there about 2 hours and about half of that was spent standing in line.  This is not a good set up for a casual evening out with friends.  Go elsewhere unless they change their process.  I talked with several people in line that were equally frustrated with the set up.  If they wish to keep this set up, then they need to at least have someone greet you that explains their processes as it is not entirely clear.",

I thought to myself, \"this is the day I'm updating my review to 5 stars!\"  WRONG.  30 minutes after ordering, I ask the bartender to please check on our food.  Turns out our food wasn't rung in.  The bartender was VERY nice and apologetic, calls his manager over and she comes to ask me if I want a drink.  No thank you, I'm on a strict diet.  At this point, I'm still very nice and tell them it's no problem, we're not in a rush.  15 minutes go by, still no food.  20 minutes later, our food finally comes.  We grab our own silverware, and begin.  My usual (frittata) is very mediocre this time around.  My toast is toasted on one side, complete wet mush on the other..was it frozen? I'm not sure.  I ask for different toast.  Fiance starts to eat, tortilla is raw.  I ask for a different tortilla.  Manager comes over and laughs it off, \"oh let's see how many times we can f*ck up today\" and throws the tortilla across the bar to the trash bin.  We keep getting asked if we want pastries, I really appreciate the offer but I say no..I'm on a diet.   We got the bill and it looks like they comped a beer off.  As a fellow restaurant owner, I'd recommend investing in some training. We definitely won't be back for awhile, if ever, at this rate.

The positives -- The Devil's Mess breakfast scramble, the breakfast burrito and the fried chicken sandwich were all very good on my previous visits.  But today's lunch visit was a failure from start to finish, and leaves he wondering how soon I want to return. There were three of us in our party. Meal #1 arrived in time, but then it was five more minutes until meal #2 arrived. That order was delivered by what appeared to be a manager who asked if we were expecting one more meal. We said yes, of course, but that was the last we saw of her.   Finally, my AZ Burger showed up ten minutes later but without the accompanying fries. The server said the fries were still in the fryer and would be out soon. Another five minutes passed before my fries showed up.   I would have accepted this service issue as a one-time blip, but the food wasn't up to par today. The burger was cooked beyond the Medium that I ordered it, with that kind of stale taste as if the patty had been sitting around waiting to be assembled. The fries were a bit of a mess, with a lot of small bits from the bottom of the fryer basket.   At this point I just ate what I had instead of complaining since the rest of my party was already well through their meals. I would have had to find someone to complain to since no one from the staff ever came by our table again. The staff, including the manager on duty, all seemed to be enjoying their time socializing with each other but that means they were ignoring the customers.   After my first few visits to Tempe Public Market, I was excited to have a place like this in the neighborhood. But now they may have seen the last of me.",

No \"I'm sorry\", no apologies re: timing.  Just a sad explanation that they are re-launching in June to remedy these issues. Assistant GM had no apologies - just excuses.   I worked in restaurant business for many years. At a minimum, you offer dessert or drink as a token. I had to ask (because he clearly was not interested in offering) for either the pretzel in a to go box, or a refund. He finally relented with a gift card  Recommendations:   Be very specific with ordering.  Quality was good, but disappointing service (no utensils, no side plates for chips and salsa). Had to request and, after no response for 10 min, get them myself.  Maybe I should get some of the tips...  A bit overpriced for that level of service. But good food. Hopefully will turn it around. Maybe lots of the $2.50 happy hour beer will help!",

When I ordered it was eight dollars, and after I said looks like the grilled cheese for kids is $3- whats the difference? The cashier said nothing, I asked if I can order that instead if there's no difference and she said next time and laughed. After I got the very generic sandwichas you can see in the picture its pretty boring, the cheese tasted old, the bread had no flavor and the watermelon was warm. I highly suggest not ordering this in the future.",

You order at a counter and take a number.  Our dishes were each $10 and the portions didn't make me feel like I got my money's worth.  Small portions.  Breakfast is my favorite meal and I hardly get to enjoy it since I am on the go Monday through Friday with work and only get to make a shake.  This is not a breakfast as a treat type of place.   Nice patio and we took the dog. Maybe their lunch options are better?",

January was a rough month for Tempe Public Market and I, since its newly opened there has always been a crazy line, I did try to get their lunch twice and had to bail both times since I am on a timed lunch on the 3rd try I got their and there was no line! 3rd times a charm, right?  I arrived about 10 minutes before 11am and didn't realize I could only order off the breakfast menu, but I was asked what I was interested in and told them and was told that they could make that happen!   I ordered the rice & beans bowl, it had black beans, brown rice, avocado, feta cheese, house made salsa and cilantro, this was a great tasting bowl and just what I was craving!  I am sure Tempe Public Market Cafe and I will become fast friends!",

I came in and at first glance it looks like a super artistic hipster cafe. Super cute! I sat down and was greeted by the staff. I wasn't super in the mood for a meal so I decided to try their pastries and I ordered a slice of their cherry and tequila caramel cheesecake. Wow. I must say I was completely blown away. The texture and consistency of the cheesecake was exactly the way I have always wanted to enjoy a cheesecake. I was so excited and for all the cheesecake fanatics ( we all know how happy a velvety slice of cheesecake can make us) . It wasn't heavy it was simply delicious. After I paid I walked over to their pastry case and I actually bumped into the pastry chef. I believe he told me his name was LT. I decided to tell him how happy that slice of cheesecake made me and then he proceeded to give me some recommendations from his pastry case. He was so sweet and we actually talked a little bit about The cafe. I ended up taking some cookies  home and to be honest I'd probably keep coming back to try everything in that case, I'm eyeing that chocolate cake. I can't wait to go back. It's quite refreshing to find a local cafe that serves exceptional little pastries.",

I eat out a lot and travel internationally or out of state about 25% of my time, so have a lot of dining experience to compare with the food they serve here.  But the food is always mediocre & prices high for what you get.  I've tried many of the items but never really got excited about any of them.  I do love the Ghost Ranch next door that apparently the same owners started, but can't figure out why they can't create good food here.   Great place to hang out if you just want a beer.",

    "text": "We have a very \"Up & Down\" relationship with Tempe Public Market Cafe. We always loved the community-type feel of the place that is directly referenced in the name...\"Public Market Cafe\". You order, find a seat and they bring you out your food. You can choose your table, re-fill your water, and just relax and have a good time with great food. It was unique and set it apart from other traditional restaurants. Our first visit was disastrous but the manager apologized, made some suggestions and we came back and it quickly became a favorite. Then all of the sudden, the menu changed and our favorite dishes were no longer there, or they changed too much. We kind of accepted this as the nature of the place.   We hadn't been in a while so we went this evening. Wow, everything changed! New decorations, new ambiance, new tables and chairs, new-ish menu and totally new ordering system. Now there's a hostess and seating and traditional wait staff. Ok I guess, but very different from what set it apart from other restaurants. So I guess that's gone, but at least the food will still be good.  8pm on a Saturday night is obviously busy and we understood that. We asked to be seated outside and we were. Unfortunately the table was underneath a leaky mister and we sat with our feet in a large puddle of water. Ok, no big deal. Then we waited. And waited. I was about to go up front just to tactfully ask how long we should be prepared to wait when a clearly frazzled young waitress came to take our drink order. She was about to dash away when my wife said \"Oh, we're ready to order, we've been here long enough already\". This may have frazzled her more. My wife ordered the appetizer and her falafel sandwich and I asked the waitress if the Garden Pizza had cheese. No cheese was listed but neither was it listed on any other pizza (except the cheese pizza) and I figured 'What's a pizza without cheese?' I think this frazzled our poor waitress even more but she finally said that, yes the pizza had cheese.  The rest of the meal was timely. We got our pretzel appetizer quickly but were disappointed to see that half of the pretzels were obviously burnt. Too bad because the ones that weren't burnt were very good with tasty dipping sauces.  Our meals come out and while my pizza looked delicious piled high with veggies...there was obviously no cheese. But there was no way I was going to say something to our waitress that might drive her over the edge. It was a decent meal, but it was not what I really wanted. I wanted a pizza...with cheese. It was good, but I would not order it again.   My wife loved her falafel sandwich and fries so at least there was that. I asked for a take-home box for the more-than half pizza left - which was already large. She came back with a little container that could not have held even one slice. Bypassing our waitress I went to the front and someone gave me an actual pizza box which was very welcome.  Not my intention but clearly someone said something to our waitress because she apologized for the box. No problem, we can just pay the bill. She came back, gave us the bill, cleared the dishes, ran the card and brought back the bill and left. I opened it ready to sign but there was no pen. Waitress was gone and we just softly laughed together. What a weird cap-off to an interesting night. Had to go to the front to find a pen.  Even though service was lacking, still left a good tip but I have reservations about coming back. Perhaps it is still a new system and the staff hasn't gotten used to it. Perhaps the waitress just had a bad night. My wife and I aren't demanding, dismissive or rude so I don't think it was us. Perhaps it was just bad timing.  I want to love this place and I want to encourage unique businesses, but the new change and the staff made it difficult this time.",

Love going to Phoenix Public Market Cafe, but finally one that is closer to me with the same great affordable and locally sourced food as it's sister restaurants. A great place to hangout anytime/day of the week with a dog friendly patio! I got the Chorizo Biscuits and Gravy with Scrambled Eggs. My sister got the breakfast sandwich and my step mom had the Asian chicken salad. Plus the Sun Devil Fries that we all shared. Everything was amazing as expected and I cannot wait to come back and bring my friends! Don't forget to stop in for their Cinnamon Rolls (weekends only while supplies last) they are to die for!! But they have a bunch of other super delicious pastries for sale every day!",

I ordered the AZ burger. Still not impressed. There's plenty of places in the area to get a burger and this place doesn't even compare.  I feel like this place is catered to the wrong demographic for the area. I'm in my 30s and I even found the music that they play extremely annoying. All I could think about was how I wanted to leave. The setup seemed like it was catered to those in their early 20s. Maybe it's great for some but this is not my type of place... which is a bummer because we live right down the street.",

Nice patio for AZ fall and winter.......needs some live music on the patio!! Update......5th visit.   My favorite place in Tempe",

They have a large patio with a bar on the inside and outside and a fireplace for the cooler evenings.   As first timers it's a little bit odd. Luckily a lot of people seem confused when they walk in and the staff does a good job of finding us and bringing us a menu, huddling us up and giving us the scoop while we stand by the door. Note: you order up front and they bring everything after though it's not obvious when you walk in.   Food was pretty good. I had a bun less burger with guacamole and loved every bite. Once seated, the waitstaff brings you refills on drinks from the bar and constantly checks up.   We had a great time hanging out and chatting. Happy Hour runs to 6pm. With tips, 3 drinks a piece and entrees for all 5 we were under $150. Will definitely be back.",

I order the pizza and even though it is silly expensive at $14 for a cheese pizza with like 6 (maybe 8?) small pieces, it is amazing. I am ready to take back everything I said and bow to the Public Market gods.  Third visit: I crave the pizza so I go back a few days later. Another $14. That's fine. But this pizza has almost no cheese on it and is burned on the bottom. They are so busy that I can't find anyone to help me so I just eat a few pieces and toss it. I am over the obsession.",

They have happy hour everyday until 7 (weekends included!) and some pretty good prices and options. I've come here twice now, each time wanting to love the food but it never quite hits the mark for me. Almost every dish I've tried has been from the happy hour menu (pizzas, pretzels/cheese, chips and guacamole/salsa) and they don't have much going on flavor wise. The cheese dip for the pretzels is watery and the pretzels didn't really taste quite like a good pretzel should. Overall, really average food and definitely not something I would crave or want to come back for. Maybe this is just the happy hour selections and something from the regular menu would be better. Drink wise, their lager was okay but I really enjoyed their house sangria. Giving this place 3 stars for the overall ambiance, friendly staff, and good happy hour selection. I would come back here for a drink at their outdoor bar before I'd come back for a meal.",

They have indoor and outdoor seating, with a dog-friendly patio. We decided to sit outside because of the inviting fire pits and abundant heaters to keep us warm. You place your order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Their menu has codes for vegetarian, vegan, dairy-free, and gluten-free options which I really appreciate since I'm vegan. I was pleasantly surprised to see quite a few vegan options, including desserts which is a big plus in my book. I loved everything I had! The pizza was loaded with veggies and had plenty of red sauce. I'm not a huge fan of blueberries, but the vegan blueberry crumble bar I had was great. This place will definitely be at the top of my list when I'm on this side of town again!",

Great patio away from the traffic, good spacing between tables and nice atmosphere.  Also, good happy hour pricing on specific beers.   The bad, food couldn't have been more bland and amateur.   I will say we ordered only one sandwich, the chips and salsas and a few cocktails, that said, these should be spot on if you claim to run a kitchen.   Chips and salsa - no salt, cold chips.  Extremely unflavored salsa, seriously nothing there. Tomatillo was no better.  Guacamole was mushed up Avocado with no other spices.  I'm telling you, we have never had a more bland experience with chips and salsa.   I ordered the Cuban sandwich, my go to judgement sandwich.  It was $13 and the worst Cuban I've ever ordered.  It was a panini I could have made at home,   on a bad night.  Seriously something we would have done with lunch meat and bread from frys.  Even the mustard was flavorless.   Drinks. Like I said, beer was a good deal.  Cocktails didn't do it.  Sangria was bland, with no fruit and in a low ball glass!  No presentation or flavor.   The Lee Trevino was good but again, in a low ball and tons of ice.   Keep in mind this is based on an app and one sandwich but these were a great entry point and it didn't go well.  There is no value here, no flavor, no experience and no reason to get food.   Go here for happy hour drinks because the ambiance is great.  Just eat before your get there.",

    "text": "We have visited TPMC four times now.  Opening day at 1pm. They ran out of food. What a fabulous problem on opening day! We were excited to return.  The next visit was for breakfast,(before they could possibly run out again) the next lunch and then dinner.  We love the atmosphere and the staff is friendly and efficient. I'm afraid we were disappointed each time with our meals! Perhaps our anticipation of this cool new dining experience gave way to high expectations?  The first meal was  Feb 16th. I had the quiche with a side of fruit- $10. My friend had the Devil's Mess- $9.75. She didn't finish hers. I asked for extra sauce for mine. We both decided it was \"just ok\"and wouldn't order it again.  The second visit was soon after the first visit. (on President's day) and they were busy. I had the chicken salad sandwich (curry based) and I was very excited. The sandwich alone was was $11! I added a small bowl of fries for an additional 4$.  The flavor of the chicken salad was very good. However the chicken portion was so small that the 9 grain bread overwhelmed the flavor and I was once again disappointed. The serving of fries was small, overdone and flavorless. I let it go because the staff was very busy. My daughter had a pizza and was satisfied. My son in law had the quiche with salad and was still hungry. Now, thinking 3rd time would be a charm, and now they've had a couple more weeks to pull it together,  we made plans to give it another shot. We went last Saturday night for drinks and appetizers. My sister had Chips, salsa and quac for $10. A friend had the chicken quesadilla, I wanted the pretzels but they were out (7:15pmish)  so I ordered Eat the Rainbow. The quesadilla was a hit. The nachos were overpriced for the amount received and we all enjoyed the unique veggie plate but the serving of dipping sauces were only half filled and scarce. So.... we want to love this place! We want to find something there we crave and can't wait to go back for,  but haven't found it yet.  Thanks for the awesome environment and Kudos to the wait staff, but I'm not excited about anything I've tasted yet and I swear I am not super picky. I'm a flight attendant for 32 years. I've eaten all over the world. So far, your selection does not warrant your prices. Other friends have said the same. \"High prices for subpar food\".  We don't want to be mean. We want to challenge this new establishment to do better. We know you can!",

It was busy mostly people in their 30's and 40's, the place was clean and bright, but the noise level would rival Buffalo Wild Wings. We found it to be trendy, a little pricey, a place that Yuppie's love. The food portions on some dishes was hefty and on some quite light. We tried the Rancher-sausage and pepperoni pizza-$16.00, when the girl set it on our table we both looked at each other like \"What the heck is this\", it was a cross between thick and thin crust, which was fine, but the size was small, maybe 5\"wide by 10\" long, a little bigger than a personal pizza in a regular pizza restaurant, even in a Yuppie restaurant $6.00-7.00 would be tops for this little guy, it did taste good though. My wife and I are seniors and I don't think this type of restaurant is our \"Cup of Tea\".",

    "text": "Nice atmosphere, decent food. First time I came a while back, I wasn't super hungry. I got a cup of lentil soup, which was good but a bit on the earthy side of flavor. Needed a little more spice to balance it out. I also got a side of chicken- I got a couple of tiny chunks of chicken for around $4. Both were just super small for the amount you paid.  Tonight I came with a friend and we both ordered the AZ Burger, mine with no bun, side salad. They accidentally brought out fries but got me the salad- good on the service! The burger was well-seasoned and the chili was a nice contrast in flavor. Fries were decent- thankfully not too greasy! This part struck me as inconsistent: I got a massive piece of lovely watermelon, and my friend had a tiny piece that was pretty sad looking. Having worked in some higher end restaurants, I do know that part of a restaurant's good reputation relies on consistency of the small things like that. Just some minor things that could be fixed, but a pleasant experience!",

I ordered a hamburger which cost $11 but the only thing you get is a hamburger no side. I added a very small side salad for $4 so $15 for my meal that I had to stand in line and order. I thought that was a lot. We also ordered appetizers which we got right away but literally 4 min. Later main food came out. It sounds weird but I'm complaining because our service was too fast! We actually got our dinners before our drinks! You also have to get up and order drinks from the bar each time you need one. If I wanted that I would just stay home. I will say the patio area is super, fire pits all around. Food was excellent and the waitstaff is very friendly and extremely helpful probably because they don't have to do much, lol.",

The loss of a star is due to the limited cocktail options on the happy hour menu. They have one really interesting spicy cocktail, but the other options are all mainstream sangrias, mimosa etc.",

    "text": "As excited as I was for the location to open I'm equally disappointed with their delivery. I'm a big fan of the chef and often drive up to St. Francis for breakfast & dinner so was looking forward to the location opening in my neighborhood.  I understand that during openings they need to work through things but my overall rating still takes that into account. This is a counter order format and they shouldn't have all of the service problems and the menu is limited and some of the food coming out shouldn't come out. I've visited for breakfast, lunch & dinner and have seen the same issues in service & inconsistent food.   Atmosphere - This is why I'm giving it two stars. Great work at the location. My only comment is to get enough chairs on the patio so that we can use all the tables they have.  Service - Lacking in all areas. If the line is out the door then open the 2nd register, common sense. Even though I know what I'm ordering the order taking process is painful which is why there are open seats in the restaurant but a long, long line. The food runners do nothing more than drop the plate. They don't ask if you need anything or announce what they are delivering. During our four person breakfast there was a 15 minute gap between the first plate and the last, and none of the runners ever said anything about the next dish coming out.   Food - Interesting menu but poor execution. AZ Burger - Cooked well enough and enjoyed the house dressing, but not a fan of the bun they use. The issue is the price/value when you have to order fries. The cost of the side for such a small serving is annoying considering what they charge for the burger. Add the side. The Rancher Pizza - The only highlight so far and have had it twice. It is a pan baked pizza where it is really doughy. The sausage and pepperoni is what makes it so good. Would like a little more sauce but it's work ordering again. The Devil's Mess - Not sure what to say, it's a mess. Biscuits & Gravy - Probably would have been better if the gravy came out something hotter than lukewarm. A single biscuit. Not worth what they are charging .  Frittata - Bad. It was skillet cooked and the outside edges were way overcooked and in center was under cooked. The bad part was the too large hunks of under cooked broccoli that they put on it.  Lacked flavor. Flarney Garney - Good enough but not very good. Tito's Cubano - A too small piece of under seasoned pork and a small slice of ham. The dijonnaise added some flavor but not enough to save the dish at that price, again without a side.   Beverages - Beer selection is so so. The Sangria is way overpriced for the quality of a 4 oz pour after you take out the ice.  For breakfast the drip coffee is a disaster. If you order drip coffee you have to self serve out of air pots that were either empty of lukewarm. And, the coffee didn't meet my personal preference.   I hope that they figure things out because the neighborhood needs a location like this. But if the quality of food doesn't improve, the service improve and they balance the quality/price then I'll look else ware.",
