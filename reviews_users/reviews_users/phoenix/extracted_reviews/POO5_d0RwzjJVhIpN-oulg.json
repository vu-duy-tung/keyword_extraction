The chicken was dry and crusty in the teriyaki chicken  and udon noodles as though it had been cooked and left to sit for hours. The sauces were lacking flavor. The other times we've been there have been good. This time AWFUL! What happened? (Check 24 on 10/14/16)",

I have been to Japan and had real Wagyu and I can say that this is a fairly close American substitute. The atmosphere was great. Waitress was prompt and courteous. Cook was fun and entertaining with tabletop tricks. Would definitely go back. Great date place.",

Ordered some drinks and put in an order for 4 sushi rolls. My water had a giant piece of cabbage or something in it so I had to send it back. We then proceeded to wait for over an hour for our sushi. Decided it wasn't even worth the wait so we paid for our drinks and left extremely hungry. Went down the street to Sakana sushi and was in and out in less time than we spent at kobe. The service was a hundred times better and the food was delicious!  I will NEVER go back to Kobe. I can't believe this place is even still in business.",

Kobe Bryant does it in the kaboose, Even if you try to deny him, He'll make your rear end loose, But I hear he prefers them slim.  $4 sushi rolls and $4 beers, This place has got it gonig on, Great for cows and for steers, They also pour their drinks strong.   Their menu has such a variety, Go alone or with a group, This place won't give you anxiety, But it might make you go poop.  DENVER!!!",

    "text": "Kobe (Koe-Bay).  We haven't been to one of these places for a teppan performance/meal in quite awhile.  We last went to one about 3 years ago in Boston.  Prior to that was about 5 years ago in Denver.  Before that was Cleveland about 9 years ago.  Based on that, look for another teppan review late in 2012 from either Chicago or Seattle - I haven't decided yet but the fares are good that far out.  Our chef Gabriel did a nice job on both the food and the performance.  There was plenty of throwing things in the air, spinning various implements around, flashes of fire, smoldering onion volcano's and tidbits tossed to the folks around the table who tried mostly successfully to catch as well as our dog.  Gabriel also rewarded folks with a nice shot of sake from his squirt bottle.  I actually had enough of these to have a nice sake buzz going.  That's right - I catch food like a dog better than the other folks at the table.  A fact I'm not sure I should be proud of.  I ordered the filet & shrimp.  It came with miso soup which was fair and lacking very much tofu, a small and plain salad with a pretty mild ginger dressing, grilled shrimp appetizer and white rice.  This is the only teppan meal I have had that does not include fried rice - it is a couple bucks extra.  I opted for the fried rice which was pretty good.  The shrimp (both the appetizer and those that came with the main course) were tender and tasty.  The filet was not as tender but still tasty.  Overall, not a bad deal for the meal & show.  I frankly have grown a bit weary of these but it is fun to go with kids or teppan virgins.",

The food was excellent, the service quick and order accurate, and even though we had a full table and it felt a little squished, the family we were seated next to was welcoming and sweet. (Though this is always hit or miss, as you can't control who you're seated next to).   I had the Filet Mignon and Chicken combo which came with the soup, salad and chicken fried rice. We had a crab wonton app, and then they brought me some chocolate ice cream with a candle in it and sang me a birthday song, complete with a drum and everything! Also, the chef threw bits of meat into our mouths from afar and we tried to catch them, and squirted sake into our mouths with a squeeze bottle: mine until it overflowed. My bf laughed at me.  Definitely going back here. Would be curious to try their sushi as well since we opted for the grill last night. They didn't have TV in our section but might in the others(?) so chose \"not sure\" on that. No big as there's so much going on that I wouldn't have been watching TV.   All in all, it was an excellent experience. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "The food is definitely good and tasty, place is clean, prices are reasonable and workers are courteous. BUT - and this was a real turn-off - the service was sooooooo slow. Our family of 4 came on a Monday evening, arriving about 7:20. We chose to do a regular table rather than the teppan table (which had a 20 minute wait - we overheard the hostess telling the couple in front of us). That didn't factor into our decision to get a regular table though. We ordered Kobe Tofu and shrimp tempura as appetizers, the kids wanted Tempura Udon soup, I ordered the soft shell crab dinner, and my husband and the kids ordered salmon sashimi, Sunshine roll, Ikura, tamago, tako and yellowtail sushi. The appetizers came out within 10 minutes - hey, off to a good start! Then the soft shell crab, then one tempura udon soup, and that's it....two tables became occupied while we were waiting for the rest of the order. The table ahead of us, with 2 people, ordered a small fried rice and a chicken teriyaki- the rice order came out after 10 minutes, then after another 10-15 minutes, the teriyaki order came out. These 2 people had finished their meal and paid and are now getting up to leave, and we still haven't gotten the rest of our order. The table behind us, with 5 people, have ordered and their appetizers are out. I am now finished with my soft shell crab dinner and my daughter is finished with her soup. A lady comes to clear my dishes and I ask where's the rest of the order - her response, \"sorry, sorry - kitchen is busy...\" very polite, yes, but it is now over an hour - I don't run a restaurant or anything but I don't understand how the kitchen can bring out half of the order and not the rest at an appropriate interval. It's sad really because the food was tasty but I don't think I'm coming back nor am I really going to recommend this place to anyone else, unless they have a good 3 hours to wait for all the order to come out.",

I mostly have gone for sushi and o think the sushi is the best thing on the menu, I especially like the Ikura and salmon skin hand rolls. Next is the teppanyaki it is good and a show is always enjoyable but not my favorite thing. I've had the lunch specials and not too impressed so I take it down a star. If you ask if I would recommend this place, yes, yes I would.",

Not only was she delivering amazing customer service to me and assisting me with what I was needing, she also was great with her other customers (it was a slow day so I got to overhear).  I am so happy I got to experience the food and customer service, delivered by Gail and her Kobe team, that inspired me to write this review!",

They have a great selection of drinks from the bar, and the customer service is pretty good.  For example, I wanted two miso soups instead of getting a salad, and they let me make that swap without a problem.  The portion size is generous, I always have some to take home.  I'm looking forward to the next time I can come here for Teppanyaki with friends!",

My favorite chef is Taylor, he's so funny and very considerate of everyone's order (will ask for clarification and makes sure your order is perfect).  The Kobe steak is to die for (make sure to order it rare or medium rare) and everything is always fresh. Luke is the best server, try to get his table of you can. He's very polite, friendly and knowledgeable. James is also great, but I have had Luke a couple of times and he's always the best!  Never left with a complaint and always full. Much better than chains like Benihana!!",

    "text": "I've only been here about eight times when I am working from our Tempe office and can say it is in my top three.  I usually get the lunch special at the sushi bar for under ten bucks that comes with:  - Miso Soup  (really simple but good) - Green Salad (Amazing! The salad dressing makes this work) - California Roll  - Spicy Tuna Roll - Wasabi and Ginger  When you get there you are stalled by the \"wait to be seated\" sign that is as obvious as the stop sign on school buses when picking up the kids, the only problem is they are not very prompt at seating or for that matter someone being in the front to greet and seat.  So I just head to the sushi bar.  The prepares at the sushi bar are all on their game, they immediately offer you a sushi menu with the understanding of order when ready.  My four stars are based on the food and service they provide because if it went with the staff that seats, brings menus, takes orders and delivers food, the four would easily be a three, maybe even two.  I avoid bringing groups because of the service not the food and can say I have tried more than just the lunch menu and the food is terrific, the quality of service does not match but I still give this place four stars because it is worth trying.",

I've been here twice with large groups & have had a great, enjoyable, experience both times!  Starting with food, this is your standard teppanyaki place. They have a good sized menu, including sushi, but the teppanyaki really makes the experience.  Their teppan chefs are always super friendly, funny, & creative.. & the thing that sets this place apart from others I've been-- they will squirt straight sake shots into your mouth.  Portions are good, service is fast, & all the staff is very welcoming. I will continue to recommend Kobes over any teppan place in the valley!",

Took a drink order and then came back and told us that he could make the drinks  We left 40 minutes in without even a drink. 6 or 7 other customers walked out too  I emailed the manager last night as well and never got a response  I took my kids to red robin for their birthday instead.",

Score!  Here's where things fail.  They don't open for lunch until 11:30, I arrived at 11.  Who doesn't open for lunch until 11:30?!  Especially with multiple business complexes in the area (think Insight, Honeywell, U of Phoenix, Express Scripts) and hungry workers.

Drinks- a large beer was only $6.75. However, the happy hour prices are around the whole restaurant MINUS the teppanyaki.   Food- miso was good. Salad was okay. I prefer thicker peanut dressing. The main course was amazing! A lot of flavor. One negative was they gave you ginger sauce and mustard but no shrimp sauce.   Service- the chef was so funny. He squirted saki in my bfs mouth twice. I appreciated how he checked in to see if anyone was a vegetarian. The show was great. We did Not have a lot of interaction with the waitress.   Would recommend to anyone wanting to try teppanyaki.",

The prices are not bad considering the amount of food you get and the sake being sprayed at you... very entertaining.

    "text": "We eat here all the time and normally the experience is good, but last night we actually walked out due to poor service. The place was busy but we sat in the back room which was not full. A 12-top was seated right next to us before we were seated. We had our 17-month old with us and had to get our own high chair. We waited twenty minutes with not a single word or even eye contact from the waitress, who walked right by us several times to other tables. She took the drink order from the big table, then went to the table behind us, apologized for the delay and took their order. I expected her to take ours at the same time, but nope, she went to put their order in. She then went to another table and refilled the guy's water glass. She came back with the drinks for the big table. I thought she might be bringing water to us, but she then proceeded to take the order from the 12-top first (which is never a fast task - they were asking about the specials on the board in the front lobby, so she had to run out to check what they were). They also had to remind her that not all drinks had been served for their table yet. All this time, still no eye contact, hello, sorry for the wait, I'll be right with you, anything to placate us. My husband even went out to the car to get snacks for our daughter, which I ended up eating. Finally we gave up and left. We did say something to front hostess and got a weak \"sorry\". If I ran my business like this, I'd be out of business! Not sure when we'll be back.",

    "text": "I had never been here before and was really looking forward to eating here with my wife and daughter. We were part of a 16 top table of friends seated at one of the Teppanyaki tables. Now, those who know me say I'm a patient guy, but this place really tried my patience. They did not disperse enough menus for the whole table and my wife, her friend and I sat her for FIFTEEN FRIGGIN' MINUTES waiting just for a menu. Finally I personally got up and walked to the host station and grabbed the menus myself. BTW we still haven't placed a drink order yet. That happened about ten minutes later as I looked at my watch and noted it was just shy of a  1/2 hour before we even placed our drink order. With that said, my Saki Bomber wasn't delivered for another 20 minutes. In short it was just shy of an hour to get drinks and order! Are you friggin' kidding me!?!!?!! My wife ordered iced tea and they brought no sugar - another 10 minutes watching the ice melt. If not part of a large party I most definitely would have got up and walked.   On that note, one of the gals saw my displeasure of the near hour long drink order and delivery method and said to me, \"Yea, the service really sucks here, you're kinda at their mercy as to what they want to do...but I love the Tepp Chef.\" Eeeek, boy, wrong kinda love I thought.    Anyhow, the prices are a bit up there but you get a lot for it. They all include a cup of Miso soup, a small salad, a shrimp appetizer, rice, hibachi vegetables and your main course cooked in front of you. Now to be fair, the abysmal non-existent service from the beginning did pick up almost to pace. I was even asked for a new beer before the other was finished = which shocked me. The food courses were rolled out timely.   Miso soup was good but not great. It was very hot and flavorful but the tofu cubes were smaller then an eraser head. The salad had if I recall correctly, a ginger vinaigrette and was small but decent with a single tear drop tomato in it. You also got a shrimp appetizer which was cooked by the Tepp Chef on the flat top. The shrimp was very good. What I liked about these courses is that my wife doesn't like miso soup OR shrimp so I got both of hers - shoot...swish.   I ordered the scallops for my dinner with double hibachi veg and no rice. I was pleased that there was an abundance of scallops and they were seasoned and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered the chicken and it was absolutely terrible- dry and tasteless.   Now the real value at this place and my only guess as to why ANYONE would venture to dine here are the Tepp Chefs. They are extremely entertaining. I got a real kick out of the Japanese chef speaking Slang Spanglish and the comedic value of this seemingly flying over most peoples head. This guy was really funny cool man. He did the whole onion volcano bit which is always entertaining. He made me slap the backs of my hands together like a friggin' circus seal and beg for a shrimp bite which he tossed up at me in the air to catch with my mouth, and when I did he squirted, from one of those squeezy type ketchup or mustard plastic bottles, sake into my mouth as a reward. That sake squirting gag was a gas man as he squirted it into the mouth of a woman at the table but kept doing it for like 7 seconds as it all dripped out of her mouth and onto her chest and shirt - funny stuff.",

We were seated at a table with another family, who also happened to be celebrating their child's second birthday. First off, I must say that this is a great restaurant for children. The servers are accommodating and the teppan chef is mindful of the children and interactive with them. Taylor was our chef and he was so friendly and fun. Definitely request him if he's working. We requested extra tofu for our daughter, not once, but twice, and they were happy to meet our requests. The food was delicious and plentiful, and none of us left hungry. We had such a great time that we came back two weeks later with my in-laws and the only difference was that Taylor wasn't working that night. The food was still delicious and we definitely look forward to returning another time. If you are bringing a toddler, you might want to use a towel or blanket to have them sitting higher in the high chair so they get a better view of all the teppan chef is doing..",

My problem is with the tuna that was in the salad they were rather large pieces so you had to bite into them... you pretty much had to wrestle with it.  Just not the quality of fish I am used to eating.   The chicken fried rice I had was awesome, I think it might be one of the best I have tasted.  Others I were dining with had the veggie tempura plate which I did try and was very good.  Fried sweet potatoes, carrots zucchini, etc.  Others had the sushi rolls and their thoughts on the fish were about the same as mine.  I would go back, just not for sushi.",

The Vegas Roll and Shrimp appetizer were very good.  Entire bill was 24 bucks with two saki bombers.  Awesome deal and quality tasty food.",

    "text": "I kind of liked Kobe. The teppanyaki has always been great. The sushi is often hit or miss. I used to be a somewhat regular there, living through the meh sushi to get the good. What stopped me going there completely, besides discovering Sushi Eye not even a mile away, was an event that happened one Saturday. My husband and I were sitting at the bar like we always did when an off-duty waitress showed up with a puppy she had just purchased. Not only did she take the dog to the sushi bar, but stood right next to us at the end of the bar so the sushi chefs could pet her new pooch. The manager joined in on the doggy loving and then took her and the dog to the back, towards the kitchen. Granted, there was probably an office back there, but do you really want a dog in the kitchen where your food is being prepared? Granted, this happened at least a year or two ago, and I called the county health department, but I haven't been back since.",

Once we were seated, we did have to wait awhile (about 10 minutes) before someone came to get our order. After the drinks arrived, we waited another 10 minutes or so for the action to start. Our chef was Andrew and he was great!! He made the experience fun and we enjoyed watching his skills. The entrees werr great, some had the filet, others shrimp and chicken. I got to try a bit of everything and the swordfish was amazing! Overall, a really fun place to share some great food and drinks with friends.",

The plus side is that I now have my salad and all of a sudden my soup showed up too.    90 mins after being seated I finally have my dinner!   Service itself needs a lot of help.

So Valentine's Day we decided to go to Kobe and did regular dining (that was not busy like teppen). Here is what we ordered... Teriyaki Combo (beef and chicken), mix tempera, 2:2 piece sake salmon, soft shell crab sushi and the Big Red Special. First we were brought not mixed tempura but shrimp tempura and I asked if that was the mixed she said yes. She brings a side of rice for the teriyaki combo but no combo, 20 min later the combo arrives no salad or miso that comes with the dinner. So now there is cold rice which she does switch out. What was the point because the teriyaki combo was cold. A different person proceeds to bring us 2 plates of salmon not what we ordered and some kind of imitation crab thing. Not ours so we wait for the rest of the sushi. In the mean time we are brought someone else's dishes 3 different times. At this point I was over it. We asked for the check and we left hungry going to McDonald's. I think this will probably be the last time at Kobe. Never have we ever experienced this type of service and for it to be a bad experience on a special holiday.",

The outside dining had a lot to be changed as far as Quality dining. The outside had a lot of trash and cigarette butts all over the ground.

I ordered the filet and shrimp and the shrimp was like rubber. It tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way and it was very disappointing. The Filet was good but I've definitely had better from other places. They offer chicken fried rice for 2.50 extra and our chef drowned it in soy sauce so it almost looked like soup when he put it in the bowl. Everyone loves chicken fired rice and he just ruined it!   The best part is when they toss the shrimp to see if you can catch it in your mouth. If your lucky enough you may get a shot and they give you free sake.   I haven't tried the Kobe steak yet, it is super expensive unless you are out for a special occasion. A lot of other reviewers seem to like the sushi.  I guess I'll have to miss out because I won't be coming back. I'll just keep going back to Benihana's! They never disappoint.",

Unfortunately, the 4 PM time was not-negotiable since my daughter had to be at her high school and ready to walk in the ceremony at 6:15 sharp.  When I explained my quandary to the restaurant, not only did they offer to open a half hour early just for our dinner party, but they were accommodating in every other way and the service and food was stellar.  My dinner guests all raved about how good their food was afterwards.    Thank you, Kobe!",

We showed up at opening time on a Sunday and were the only ones in the teppan area.  Quick service.  Cook Trevor gave a great performance after first checking for food allergies.  All dishes were delicious.  Lunch portions are HUGE!  Wish we had come by here years ago!  Please give them a try!",

After being told it would take 20 minutes to be seated it took upwards of 30 minutes. After being seated it took 40+ minutes to receive the (1) sushi roll I ordered. In the process of waiting with my (1) other friend I watched a family of (8) who arrived 10 minutes after we did receive their food 10 minutes prior to my own food. The waiter was polite and apologetic but obviously their kitchen staff and management have no idea how to treat their customers. I won't ever go back.",

    "text": "So we made reservations at Kobe for a Saturday night and the event that we were at prior went a little longer than expected. We went ahead and called Kobe and they were extremely friendly and let us keep our reservation and just pushed it back thirty minutes which was great. When seated at the table I was with a party of four including myself and the rest of the table was another party of four and a party of two. You're given a server as well as the cook. The server was kind but seemed all over the place and very confused the entire night. This only got worse as the dinner went on. The cook was great, cooked the food entertainingly, and had a great personality while doing it. As we were seated right away she asked us what we wanted to drink which to me is fine because I was just going to get my go to which is lemonade, for I believe fifty cents extra you can get a flavor lemonade so I got the strawberry which was a little to sweet for me. One of the people that was in my party asked if they had a certain kind of wine and the server seemed to have no idea what so ever which is fine but like I said earlier she just really didn't seem like she was mentally present at all.  We didn't get any appetizers because your meal comes with a salad, miso soup, rice and a Shrimp appetizer. By the time I get to my meal I'm already having to undo a button on my pants! So whoever said its not a lot of food is crazy! The salad: First things first, the dressing on this salad is to die for. I believe it's some sort of ginger dressing but it's delicious. Salad as a whole though, ehhh. They sort of only put dressing on the top and the bowl is kind of small so it's hard to mix in the dressing so the lettuce on the bottom gets none. I ended up only eating the lettuce on top. Which is fine, I needed the stomach room for my food anyways! The Soup: I love miso soup. And theirs was good. The rice: For about two dollars extra you can upgrade to chicken fried rice instead of just steamed rice. Upgraded, it's worth the extra cost! They throw eggs and chicken in the rice and it's absolutely delicious. Shrimp Appetizer: Its just three pieces of shrimp which are delicious but I'm not sure I would call it a appetizer. Next was the actual dinner! I was really feeling seafood so I got what I believe is called the seafood delight, it comes with shrimp, scallops, and lobster. It was absolutely delicious. Then two other people in my party got the filet mignon and lobster tail combo, and the last person got sword fish. Tried the sword fish and it was cooked really well and had a good flavor, and tried the filet mignon and he cooked them absolutely perfect.  When it came to splitting checks and paying it was a complete mess for the entire table. The server had to go back and resolution them and fix them twice because it was done wrong and it felt as if it took forever.  Meanwhile the whole dinner the waitress was nowhere to be seen. I really wanted a water so I had to flag her down which I hate doing. For one of the brief moments she was at our table she dropped an entire full cup of water on a lady across the table from me and it was completely all over her and the glass actually ended up in her purse spilling the rest. YIKES. Needless to say, she looked like she went swimming. I felt bad for the server of course, I work in a restaurant too, it happens to the best of us. But she didn't say she was sorry or anything which kind of surprised me. At the end of the meal the couple ended up getting extremely upset because they never got an apology, no manager ever came by to say anything, and their bill despite everything remained the same. They then asked to see a manager to say something about it and the manager herself said that they don't control their staff and can't control what they mess up on so they can't be held liable...YIKES TIMES TWO. What do you mean you can't be held liable, they're your staff at your restaurant??? They just didn't want to give any discount or anything. This horrible level of customer service really bothered me.  Over all the food great! Service ehh, not so great. For about the same price I have had better experiences at Benihana.",

The Tempura my wife ordered came nice and hot but was not cooked long enough. the tuna roll I ordered was good. The Bento Box took way too long to get to the table, was not hot and had been sitting about 10 min. before brought out to the table. You could tell the staff was not trying to please anyone. The meat in the Bento Box was good meat. The rice was a blob.  I find that good Japanese restaurant's have high standard's for cleanliness food and staff. I did not find that necessarily here.",

And they won't seat you until your entire party is present either.  Anyway, the place is entertaining and quaint at the same time.

However, if you're also looking for good sushi in the desert I may recommend looking at other options. Overall, it really was not bad, but also not super good especially for the price. I think you're primarily paying for the tepenyaki experience here.

I would say it's an average pick but of course that could be my first time around and partly because the choices I made were of the ordinary.   For a Tuesday night the restaurant was not too bad but the Sushi bar was empty. Which is where we sat. They do have teppanyaki tables for the all fun entertainment.   We were seated quickly since there wasn't much of a crowd. Beverages were given within the first few minutes. Ordering took a bit longer than I would have expected. They have a sushi menu that you mark with a dry erase marker and then a full menu.   Picks of my night: - pickled cucumber slices with sprinkled sesame seeds with your ginger and wasabi. Free with your sushi order.   - 2 choice sashimi: yellowtail (hamachi) and salmon (sake) with 3 pieces each for a total of $14. Ehh not my kinda price for slices that could be a bit thicker. Taste was Normal as can be.   - Alaska roll: California roll (for you all that are not so adventurous) with salmon on top. This wasn't anything out of the ordinary. $8.50  - chicken udon stir fry: a well-cooked plate. Smells resonated within a nose distance! I'd say if you're looking for a hot plate this would be it. Seasoned cubed chicken, thin julienned carrots, scallions, all mixed in the thick rice udon noodle. The dinner plate was a bit small for a dinner portion. $9  Overall: decent food for Japanese restaurant.",

It is a big portion and I think its only $5.99  They have happy hour during the day that includes appetizers, sushi and alcoholic beverages.",

    "text": "Ordered take out hibachi from here for my birthday last Sunday & I wasn't too impressed.   First, placing the order took 20 minutes (no lie) because the host wasn't understanding my order. I ordered two sushi rolls, fillet/shrimp combo dinner and chicken/lobster combo dinner. The host put me on hold for 6 minutes because he couldn't figure out his to ring it up. Still I was being patient, so he didn't ask how I wanted my steak cooked, so I said I would like the fillet to be medium rare, he said okay. Then he hung up on me!! I was so appalled because I was not rude to him at all!  So we go & get our order. We are missing the dipping sauces that come with the hibachi meals, we had a wrong sushi roll & my steak was well done.   I was not impressed with this at all because our meal was a little over 100! When I called the restaurant no one wanted to help or seemed to care what I saying.   It's a shame because of what I did eat, the food was good. Just terrible service. Maybe if we ate there it would have been different. But that shouldn't naked a difference.",

Cook: We requested Jorge as our cook, since my friend comes in a lot and said he's the best. He truly was amazing! He was so engaging with all of us. My little girls are 7 & 9 and he just made their experience memorable. This was their first teppen grill so I appreciated that a whole lot.   Food was good. Very flavorful! I wish they had more vegetarian options but it was tasty.   We will definitely be back and will request Jorge again. If it weren't for him, our first experience at Kobe would have been our last.",

The customer service needs some improvement, there was nothing special, everyone was nice, no conversation starters or anything. The place is always pretty empty when I visit, except the teppan area.   I usually order gyoza, chicken terriyaki bowl and assortments of sushi in the HH menu. They have pan fried and steamed gyoza. I prefer the fried gyoza because it gives it a little crunch and brings out the flavors more. The chicken terriyaki is average. I enjoy their sushi but I notice the consistency of the rice changes with whoever is making it. I do like that it's not too noisy. The bartenders are cool and fun to talk to when we sit their. I was convinced into ordering the popular Godzilla drink which I really enjoyed.",

My dinner partner and I had planned on going to Sushi Eye for happy hour last night, but after driving up and down Elliot 4 or 5 times without finding it and with the end of happy hour quickly approaching, we finally pulled into Kobe out of sheer desperation. Biggest mistake ever.   So, the hostess asks us whether we want sushi or teppan, and we say sushi. Then, sushi bar or table? We've got some talking to do, so we say table. Once we're seated at a table with menus, our eyes pop out of our heads when we see the sushi prices. Like, we're talking $8 spicy tuna rolls. So we ask the waiter whether there are any happy hour specials. He says, \"Yes, but we only have happy hour at the sushi bar, not at the tables.\" Hmm, okay. So we move to the sushi bar and ask for a happy hour menu. The waiter says, \"Oh, you mean happy hour sushi? I thought you meant drinks. At the sushi bar we only do happy hour drinks. If you want happy hour sushi, you have to sit at the main bar.\" So, we've been there for 3 minutes and moved twice. Not exactly auspicious beginnings.  It only got worse from there. There are two happy hour sushi specials: spicy tuna roll and california roll, both $3.25. We were starving so we ordered two of each, plus Kobe tofu and pork gyoza (both also on happy hour special for $3.25).   It was the worst sushi I've ever had, and I've had a lot of sushi. The california roll was horrendous. It was 95% imitation crab and mayonnaise, with teeny slivers of cucumber and brown avocado. The spicy tuna roll, though not as actively offensive as the california roll, was boring and mushy. The Kobe tofu was bland and had an oddly spiced dipping sauce - eating it was reminiscent of eating McDonald's chicken nuggets dipped in sweet and sour sauce. And not in a good way. The pork gyoza, though, was wonderful, though at $3.25 for 5 of them, it was not enough of a bargain to warrant a return trip.   And all, the while, since the place is (for whatever reason) really busy, we're stuck at the end of the bar, where we have to listen to the world's most obnoxious waitress prattle on to the bartender about how she's soooooo tired of all these women glaring at her because they think she's after their men, and how she wants to \"get a t-shirt that says, \"Honey, I'm not after what you've got because I've got my own stuff to deal with at home.\" Wow. Witty.   Anyway, this place is awful and I'll never be back. Luckily, we finally found Sushi Eye on the way home (hiding sneakily between a Quizno's and a Baja Fresh, if memory serves) and hopefully we'll have a more pleasant happy hour experience next week. Sigh.",

Right as we were getting situated, a waitress walked into the room with a tray of drinks and promptly dropped half of them in a loud crash.  I would consider that excellent foreshadowing and a metaphor for the overall dining experience.    First we had to wait forever because we were the only ones at our table.  After asking if it would be much longer, they said you have to wait 15 minutes and 10 had already passed so we decided to invest another 5 minutes hoping for some sort of payoff in the end.  Ten minutes later, we finally got to place our order after we asked again.    In a nutshell: the salad and soup were nothing special, my fork was dirty, and the entrees were bland and burnt.  There didn't seem to be much seasoning used, if any.  Definitely not as good as Ichi Ban and the meals cost about $5 more, plus they charge $2.00 extra for fried rice, unlike at Ichi Ban where fried rice is free.  I was glad when we finally got out of there and I don't plan on going back.",

    "text": "Kobe just barely deserves three stars, and here's why.  The food is a wild mix of \"I've had much better at Shogun Express\", to \"Wow!  This is really tasty.\"  The service was another mixed bag.  Our server wasn't on the ball, but some of the others covered for him.  I'm not sure exactly how long they've been open, so the service may improve.  Overall, I feel comfortable saying that you don't get what you pay for.  Last night, my wife and I met a friend at Kobe for dinner.  We started off with an order of Gyoza; it was served warm-ish.  I almost sent it back to be heated up, but had a feeling they'd just throw it in the microwave.  The flavor was good, but nothing special.    Our Gyoza was followed by Ginger salads and Miso soup.  As our friend said, Miso soup is tough to mess up.  It happens, but not often.  Luckily, Kobe's was just fine.  As was the salad, which consisted of iceberg lettuce, a cherry tomato, a couple strands of carrot, and the only thing capable of saving such a pathetic salad, some yummy ginger dressing.  The ladies ordered sushi and both really enjoyed their rolls.  As I'm not a sushi eater (I know, I know, shoot me now!), I can't really comment on the quality other than the girls' reactions and comments, which were mostly (if not completely) positive.    I, on the other hand, ordered a cucumber roll and the teriyaki chicken and steak combo.  A cucumber roll is another one of those really difficult things to screw up.  There's was just fine.  The teriyaki dish was the worst teriyaki chicken/steak I've had in recent memory.  The meat was a dry and the rice was either over cooked, or had been sitting out too long like the Gyoza.  For desert, we ordered a mango sorbe and a vanilla tempura (read fried) ice cream.  Neither were anything to write home about, but neither were bad either, which is exactly how I'd characterize the restaurant.  Although I didn't try the entire menu, my recommendation is that you stick to sushi and miso soup.",

We were seated promptly and or drink orders were taken while we waited 5 min for our table to fill up. They took our orders as we were ready to give them and we waited for our chef. He was seriously a lot of fun, I wish I could remember his name! They might charge an extra $2 for fried rice but the free saki shots made up for that. Our food was prepared perfectly as ordered and we got the standard flipping food at someones mouth and one of the better onion volcanos I've seen.

Getting squished into a table of 8, when you only have 2 sucks too.  For teppanyaki, this place is a-OK for a while. Once you eat here a few times, you start to realize that not all the chefs can actually cook. You have to find the chef you like, and stick with them.   Also, after a while it all tastes the same. This place is really good, when you have not had it in a few weeks/months.  Salad and soup, not so good. Tell them to keep it!  The cooking experience can be fun for someone who has not been there before, or for children. Who doesn't love a beating heart made from fried rice, or a fire shooting train when the lights are dimmed?  Overall its good. Nicer place than Ichi Ban. And way way better than the local Benihana.

It  was made and forgotten about a left on the counter. 2. Somebody else ordered it and didn't want it, so did they decided to give it to me instead of making me a fresh one. Either way I had to eat cold food. I probably could have told them it was cold and they probably could have fixed it. But my judgement is on how they got it done the first time, not how they can make up for it. A good excuse on why it was cold would have been that it's supposed to be served cold, but I've ordered this dish in the past it was always served hot or at least warm.",

    "text": "Okay... so I think the food is really, really good here, what with the use of all of that extra sweet, salty, delicious creamery butter that they add to everything to cook it in front of you... so very, very tasty... and heart-stopping! But tasty, oh, yessss...   Here's the thing, though - the food is not consistent. We had a party of 6 and shared the table with another party of 4 and everyone had a different protein. So on our side, there was one who ordered chicken, two with scallops, one with shrimp, and two with filet. The chef comes out and gets to work on rice: some had fried and some had steamed. Steamed was served first and the bowl of rice just sat in front of the customer as there was nothing to go with it yet. Then the fried rice was cooked and served, but again, that food sat untouched. Scallops were cooked first and distributed to the two people who ordered them, but veggies were not cooked yet and no one else's food was either, so the scallops sat on the plates, untouched. Next was shrimp, then filet, then finally chicken, and THEN veggies. when the Veggies were finally served the chef scooped from a large pile of sauteed vegetables and started serving the table from the inside out, so the first three people on either side of the table got the large chunks of vegetables, and the people in the outer three chairs were served what was left, which was little slivers of overcooked, mostly onions. By then my scallops, which were seared to perfection, were cold, as was my rice. The food was very tasty and seasoned correctly but most of my food was cold when I was able to finally start eating.   For $25 a plate there's gotta be a better way than this, doesn't there?",

    "text": "This place is all about what they cannot do or will do and if they do what you ask they will charge you.  I asked for two California Rolls one with no cucumber.  When it was brought to the waiter's attention, the waiter took the roll back to the person who made sushi.  His resolve was to throw some cucumber on the plate and advise us if we wanted cucumber in the roll we would now have to place it there ourselves even though it was his mistake.  During the time at another table a lady ordered a second dish which came with salad.  She already had salad and wanted soup.  She was told there was no button to subsitute the salad so he would have to charge her for the soup.  He then told her on the bright side, the salad she was now getting had a different salad dressing than the previous one she had eaten.  Funny how I ordered the tempura and there was a button to charge for teriyaki sauce but no substitution.  It was an add on.  After getting tired of them telling us and other tables what they could not do, or would not serve, I cancelled the order and left.  I remember visiting this place a previous time vowing I would never go back because of the lack of service and making dishes with condiments I wanted or being charged for substitution or straight out refusals to make an item my way.  I will NOT be returning to this dump ever again.  It is not the staff but someone who has trained them to make no changes or substitutions without charging or at all.  It is really sad cause the atmosphere is nice but the service really sucks at this place,  Do not patronize this type of behavior cause I know I am not going to.",

Sadly the reviews were far from the truth. I've heard restaurants reaching out to people to write good views on yelp and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. Yes the restaurant was beautifully decorated, it looked promising at first with good costumer service and the decorations. Me and my boyfriend ordered each sashimi and a roll. I got a rainbow roll, usually try a roll I know pretty well when trying new sushi places. The sashimi tasted quite warm and not very fresh. Reminded me of McDonald's food when they freeze, unfreeze, freeze then cook their food. The furtherest from fresh I've ever had. The roll wasn't impressive or even bearable. The roll was missing a certain taste that comes in all good sushi. And it looked like it was smashed in really fast. The worst part was the wasabi, I'm a huge wasabi fan and very surprised when they brought out a dried out clay of green and called it wasabi. Very disappointed, maybe I caught the chef on a bad day or maybe I shouldn't trust yelp as much as I should!",

First, we didn't like where we were going to be seated and they quickly moved us to another table so that the baby would get a better view. The service was very good.  We ordered Sushi first and it was amazing!  Very reasonably priced as well.  The sushi came out as it was ready so that it wasn't sitting there waiting for the rest of the orders to be made.  That was a nice way for us to share and try all the sushi.   The men at the table ordered Saki bombs.  They were huge!   The best part of the evening was the show.  My chef knew we had first timers and put on a great show that included everyone at the table.  My nephew was amazed and even ate some of the rice.  So, with that, the food was delicious!!!   I have been to many different steakhouses in many different states.  This by far is one of the best!  I would recommend the filet minion. And if you really want to treat yourself, get the Kobe steak.  It was amazing!",

I specifically asked the waitress if we could order off the happy hour menu before we ordered anything. She said it would be fine as long as we ordered more than $20 off the regular menu. When the bill came she said the manager told us we could either get happy hour prices or $20 off the bill. I wouldn't have ordered $20 worth of full-priced sashimi  a la cart or an extra carafe of sake if I thought this would be the case. I wasn't happy about this and I won't ever go back to this place. The waitress didn't even say \"Happy Birthday\" to me even though she insisted on looking at my license to verify that it was my birthday. There really isn't anything special about Kobe so I'd suggest you go to RA for sushi and Benihana for teppanyaki.",

We waited for the rest of the party to arrive before any of us wanted to order dinner. It seemed the waitress was annoyed from the very beginning.   After we decided to order the waitress seemed to careless about our drinks being refilled. She would rudely reach over our plates and in between us without saying \"excuse me\". Anytime anybody wanted anything she would ignore them as she walked away.   I thought it was just me but we all noticed it. I understand if your waiting on a large party it may seem overwhelming. If that is the case than management should assign two waitress's to the party so that everybody gets what they need.   The food was great and I can't even complain about it because the food had nothing to do with the waitress.   On the second visit back. We went during lunch. It was not happy hour but normal lunch hours. Our waitress didn't even make eye contact or smile or anything at all other than show up at our table to take our order and after our food arrived she asked if we needed anything else after we were almost done. When we needed refills on our drinks she never even offered anybody a refill except for the person who had a empty glass. We finally got refills from the bus boy.   The food was great. I can't say the service is wonderful. The hostess is friendly.   I would go back because I love their sushi but I wish they would get better waitress's who actually care about the customers needs.",

For those of you who took off stars cause the cook took too long to arrive with the  ingredients, keep in mind that they would have to find them, cut them, as well as grab the seasonings, cooking wines and oils, and utensils as soon as the order was given. Our cook was awesome, and food turned out great. Even though it may look like a tiny portion, it's not and they will ensure you will not leave hungry. Unlike benihana, the cooks squirt a shot or two of sake (rice wine they cook with) into your mouth, which mine did three times. Also they try to toss extra shrimp into your mouth, hint: keep an eye on it to catch it- they give you sake anyway even if you fail. Food was awesome (filet mignon and lobster tail, bf got steak and shrimp) and had me feeling stuffed less than halfway through the meal. Also was given a rose by our waiter after it. Very good service! I'd go again sometime.",

    "text": "I do LOVE this place. It's not as expensive as teppan restaurants back home (California) and the food totally works for me. But let me break it down...  Service: I've never had a problem with the hosts, but sometimes the servers take a while. Now, mind you, this isn't EVERY time, just some of the time. But you don't come here if you're in a hurry, anyway...  Drinks/Food: I'm not 21, nor am I endowed with a \"fake\" ;),  so I can't say anything about the drinks. But the food...ahhh, so good. Portions are big, which is good for leftovers! Most dinner meals come with miso soup, steamed rice (which can be exchanged for fried at a slightly higher price), salad, and the entree itself. I think the sushi tastes great. I order the Buddha's Delight every time and I'm not disappointed, except...  -Sometime's the food's a bit greasy. Even the vegetables. Just tell the chef to go easy on the oil and butter. I know that people don't come here to eat the healthiest meals of all time, but still. -I am about 90% vegetarian and don't eat the meat. BUT! When I do try it, it always seems a tad undercooked. I try bits of steak, shrimp, or chicken (aka whatever my friends are having) almost every time I'm here, so yes, I have experience, and yes, it does taste a tad undercooked almost every time.  Price: The meals *average* about 25/person including tax, but not tip. Lunches are cheaper. The average I listed above is assuming you get the typical teppan meal, which most people do. Sushi and other appetizers aren't priced horribly, either. Your actual bill per person could be higher, but probably no more than 60 - there's lobster on the menu. I'd be very surprised if it was that much, though.  Decor/\"feel\": It's dark in here...not too lively. Somewhat interesting Japanese-style decor (well, duh) I don't really care, though. I come here to EAT!  Entertainment value: As a 20-year-old who's been to many different teppan restaurants HUNDREDS of times, I can say that this place is no different than any other. There are some cool chefs here, of course (I like Chris)...but unless you're a teppan n00b or a little kid you're not going to be enthralled. I will say it once again though: I personally do not care. I'm hungry.  OVERALL: Great place to eat, fun with a group, but make sure you talk to your chef and that you're not in a hurry. Awesome.",

    "text": "Ate here once before and it was fine, mediocre sushi at cheap happy hour prices. I went back today to try teppanyaki for my boyfriend's birthday since he loves teppanyaki. We went during lunch hour and called ahead and they said the tables close at 230pm. We get there at 200pm and they told us the tables were closed already. I was like fine whatever, We can just start ordering and then order off the happy hour at 3. So I get the chicken teriyaki lunch plate and it was disgusting. The chicken was severely over dry that I just couldn't eat it, and I'm not a picky eater at all. I basically just paid to eat a cup of rice and cold mushrooms that were also stir fried with the chicken. We told the waitress we also wanted to order off the happy hour menu and she ended up just bringing out our checks around 245. I mean, do they not care about making money lol? At that point I didn't think it was worth it to give them any more of my money so I went home and ate pizza instead.",

    "text": "I found this place searching yelp and read reviews for both listings: Kobe Japanese Steakhouse and Kobe Teppan and Sushi. We decided to try Kobe and were not disappointed. We went for teppan on a Tuesday evening and were seated quickly. There were not many people at the restaurant, and the staff was friendly. Our chef was an older man who was fun and entertaining. He interacted with everyone and performed the usual tricks. He definitely made this experience an unforgettable one. The food was delicious. I do wish they added more tofu to the miso soup, but that would be about the only suggestion. The seafood and filet were very flavorful. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves seafood. I did not try the Kobe beef, but based on the quality of their other food I would imagine it would be very tasty. Of course this is in Tempe so anyone from the east or west coast might have a different opinion, but for seafood in Arizona it is great.",

    "text": "Occasionally, we will make the rounds at Teppan restaurants, and this time around; we opted to give this place a try. We're not neophytes at this, so we always arrive with some reservations.   From the moment we walked in, we were none too impressed with the greeting we received from the people whose job it is to welcome you with a smile. And make your first impression a memorable one. It was memorable alright - in a negative way! The greeting was cold and disinterested. Yes, there are two of us! We are sorry that we interrupted whatever you were doing to let you know that customers actually want to dine here this particularly evening - NOT!  After being seated with another party, we were quite impressed with the cheerfulness and attentiveness of our server. She was very prompt and courteous as well. She actually did a great job of livening up the mood to get us ready for our Teppan chef.  Enlivened, he was not. Our chef was dry and reserved. Either he was having an off day, a bad day, or this is his typical demeanor. Definitely not the kind of presentation we were expecting.  And to top it all off, the food wasn't that impressive either. The chicken was definitely undercooked, and so were the vegetables. The rice was passable. The only redeeming quality was my wife's Kobe Beef steak. She indicated that it was done to her liking.  And as we were leaving, we passed by reception booth, and received the same cold shoulder we got when we first arrived. It's no surprise that this place was more than 1/2 empty on a Friday evening. Hopefully, they can endeavor to rectify these deficiencies.",

Lot of options for seating- teppan where they make the food in front of you, normal seating at a table or booth, or high top seating at the bar.   They have a really solid happy hour for drinks and rolls which is usually what draws me in. They have the usual rolls but also some specialty rolls that are really amazing. The yum yum roll is my fav- served with special sauces drizzled on top and served warm. Sooooo good. Something I never pass up on is the ginger salad too- it's really small and a great appetizer but there's something real special about that ginger dressing on top.   ALSO, some of the best chicken fried rice ever. You can order small and large sizes and it's made to order so you can order without certain ingredients (i always skip on the onions).",

The whole environment was great, calm, and that was what I need that day.   The services were average, which mean I did wait for little bit minutes even I saw not many of people there but still considered ok :).   The sushi was great one, they have sea urchin and unagi that were great. The miso flavor was nice with enough amount in a small bowl.  Ok, the only minus was, this sushi chef (there was two people behind the bar), they nonstop talked, chatted, and I had to listen (and waited for my sushi) this guy talked even until I am done eating.   Overall, love this hidden place, I will come over to try something else, and YES, I would love to recommended this place.",

We arrived just after 5pm to an empty restaurant, and weren't seated for at least 30 minutes when another couple finally arrived.

Once seated, and after our drink order was finally taken, another party of four were swiftly seated and rushed to place their drink order. (They literally hadn't even been given a menu yet.) For some reason, while we were first to arrive we were the very last to be served at our table. We finally made it out of there around 730. No dessert, nothing fancy, just a two hour wait for actual sustenance, unless salty soup and iceberg lettuce is going to keep you sated.... dont come here hungry.",

The description on the menu sounded like Kobe beef but what I was served certainly didn't look/taste anything like what I was expecting. Kobe beef is supposed to be more tender than a filet. It is supposed to be marbled with fat throughout and almost melt in your mouth when you chew. What I was served didn't look like Kobe beef and it was tougher than the filet my partner was served. The meal was also $4 more than expected because their online menu had it priced $4 cheaper than the in-store menu.  Overall, I was disappointed with the experience but will say that the drink specials, appetizers, (my partners) filet and scallops were great.",

My boyfriend and I decided to try this teppanyaki as it is close to our home, we usually goto Osaka however wanted to try something closer. This was the worst teppanyaki experience we have ever had. The teppanyaki chef was absolutely terrible. Incompetent, lackadaisical, and truly awful. We just went for a casual date night that turned into a nightmare. We ordered filet mignon for our main course to share which comes with rice, salad, soup etc. The rice and meat were under cooked and lacked any flavor at all amongst many other issues encountered throughout the dinner (i.e chef spraying saki all over my boyfriends face) The only reason I give two stars is because the bartender and server were fabulous. Our meal (we still paid for drinks & sushi) were comped which was also nice considering the terrible experience. The server was a great sport about the whole experience. We ended up down the road at the Vine!",

Pretty decent slicing and dicing; along with a fire show of sorts.   The anglo chef is the best, in my opinion.  Forgot his name since we do not go the \"table\" route very often.   As to the food quality at the table, not bad.  The shrimp and calamari have consistently been fresh and tasty; couple times I'd say \"not so much\" as to the steak.  This said, I could not give them a bad rating on any of the food items, either.   Service quality has always been excellent in the bar, sometimes a tad slow if you are at a \"table\" for teppanyaki.   All in all, we are fairly satistfied customers and Kobe is one of the better sushi locations in South Tempe.",

We love this place because Chef Taylor is so fun, passionate, and makes the food perfect every time. After our first experience with Taylor, we now request him every time (do it!) and have become regulars for birthdays and mother's days.  His scallops are the best I've had in my life, but the meat, vegetables, and shrimp are always incredible.  He's always telling jokes, engaging the kids, and aims to please (he chops extra garlic for my dishes upon request, and looks out to offer extra sake to those who want it)!  At the end of dinner my mom and myself were given roses for mother's day!  I drive out from North Phoenix to come here for family dinners. It's a treat and well worth taking the time/ drive out to experience!",

We bought a TravelZoo Local Deal for the $25 Theater-Style Teppanyaki or Sushi Dinner for 2 at Kobe (Chandler, AZ). It was plain awful. They completely bait and switched on us and treated us like second rate customers.   What began as either sushi or teppanyaki to the tune of $75 (we opted for sushi) turned into a fixe prix three course menu with extremely limited choices, none of which added up to the said dollar value. Not only that, but they sanctioned off a separate room for travelzoo local deal diners. A dirty room with no music, a new waitress-in-training who didn't speak english, a supervising waiter who apologized for the obvious bait and switch, stating the owners wanted to make it \"simpler and more organized\" when clearly they were trying to save a dime.  After we showed our surprise to the unexpected change, we had very little attention or service for the rest of the night. We had to basically beg to get the bill so we could leave. The food honestly wasn't even good, some was just plain inedible.   It was a depressing experience and I suggested that travelzoo never partner with that particular restaurant again. I also suggest that you find another more palatable place to dine. Plenty of other choices in town, no need to see for yourself here.",

I noticed the music was a bit louder in the dining area, as opposed to the sushi bar. With Adele-like music playing, it wasn't obtrusive.   I got the chicken katsu and an iced tea for $11.89 plus tip.   After five mins I got my tea and miso soup. The soup was your classic miso, with tofu and seaweed plus a few shavings of scallion. Good flavor there but the seaweed was slightly over bitter.   Next came the entree, about 5 mins later.  The chicken was nicely and thoroughly breaded and then fried. It came on a bed of green and purple cabbage. If I had some vinegar sauce, it would've served a purpose other than decoration. The meal also came with a small bowl of white rice.   Still working my way thru the menu, so that's it for now.   Update: I've been back too many times to count. I've stuck with the sushi bar and have had great experiences each time. Fast, pleasant service, fresh sushi and good lunch prices. Msn really takes care of his customers and I highly recommend you visit the sushi bar to find out for yourself.",

Their menu selection is solid, with similar offerings as the aforementioned competitor. In our two trips we've ordered the hibachi meals, yakisoba, some rainbow rolls and gyoza. The food is really good and if only rating this restaurant by that criteria, I'd likely give it a 4.5 stars. However, something we noticed on our last visit was the lack of energy in the restaurant. You'd expect a teppanyaki restaurant to be loud and full of commotion as the chefs prepare everyone's food, but this was not the case. For me that's all part of the experience. Also, the most recent chef we had was not very entertaining or engaging with the patrons. For that reason, I've rated this restaurant as 4 stars. Still not a bad rating, but could be a 5 if they turn it up and improve the buzz in the room. I'd like to add that a coupon is regularly sent in the mail for $20 after spending $100, which with a family of four is like having the tip paid for. We'd probably go again, but next time we're going to Benihana - per the request from the kids.",

To start our wait time before getting seated at a Teppan table was an hour and a half which was just because we went on a Friday not their fault but they were busy.   Now my biggest pet peeve is that we paid for a Darcie Kent bottle of wine to try something new and when we were at the bar I kept asking my friend why are bottle didn't say Darcie Kent anywhere. When we left I googled Darcie Kent bottles and they all clearly say Darcie Kent. We don't remember what ours said but it said something that started with Wes---  Besides that we had a very positive experience. Out server was Andrew and I would go back to see him in action anytime! He was so funny and entertaining. I recommend asking to be seated with him specifically.",

It was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor compared to other similar places I've been. Not sure why, because usually this kind of food tastes the same regardless where you go. Don't think I'll give them another chance. Might go to the basic Benihana.",

They said it would be a 15 min wait, and after 45 minutes, we asked the hostesses when we were going to get seated. They said that there was a large party ahead of us and that it was going to take another 45-60 min wait.

Our reservation was for 6:30pm, party of 13 Our entire party arrived by 6:45 Seated by 7 Party that arrived After us sat and began eating during this hour... the chef arrived to the table After 8pm. He Had an open argument/disagreement with our server and then walked away because the order was \"written wrong\".   I don't know if there are enough words for this experience to write at this moment, so feel free to ask questions.  Yes, I spoke to the manager. It was obvious that he didn't know how to handle this situation. Yes he apologized to me, unfortunately never came to the table to apologize to the rest of the group nor did he offer them anything. He explained that it takes time to prepare for large parties and the order was written in the wrong order so the chef had to go back and prepare it again......... I can't say that this makes any sense since there weren't any additional ingredients needed. At this point everyone's mood was down. Think about it, you tell your party dinner at 6:30 so people bring their appetites. Yes there is soup brought out, but not everyone wants miso soup. Yes they bring a salad out, but not everyone wants a salad. So imagine waiting from 7 until after 8:15/8:30 for your order to be cooked. The manager comped my husbands dinner only (This was his bday dinner) and then left the restaurant. When there was an issue with closing the tabs (because he had comped the wrong dinner) he was no where to be found.   The rest of the staff was understanding and helpful with what they could do, but the manager and chef could have done better. What a mess. No social skills for this type of industry.  We enjoyed visiting this location for Our special occasions until now, can't say we'll be back much less recommend it. I'm not sure what happened to the prior management, but they're missed.",

Instead of taking us all back to the Teppan table together (which is where we all ended up) the hostess proceeded to tell us all individually it would be a few minutes and made all of us wait. Pointless.   Once seated we order an appetizer and it never came but later still charged on our bill. The chef was not very engaging at all as we observed other tables have shrimp tossed in their mouth and that was not the case for our table. The chef asked questions about our food order/preference and did not honor our request. For example, he asked how I would like my steak cooked? I advised medium and he proceeded to cook it well done with the other order on the grill. I asked for the fat from the steak be kept on plate and it proceeded to throw it away. He prepared the shrimp and placed my food on another persons plate. To everyone at the table it just appeared he was just trying to hurry up and go home for the night and could care less about getting our orders right.   The waiter was like Flash lightening bolt and I can only remember him quickly removing our salad and soup bowls but cannot recall him asking how things were going let alone if we needed anything. Even when he brought our bill before we could get a word out he had ran away to the back. Food wasn't great and service was poor. Don't recommend this place. I'll stick to Benihana's.",

    "text": "Allow me to apologize in advance for the following novella.  Sorry, not sorry.  Kobe is by far my absolute favorite place in AZ to eat. While the food is amazing, it wouldn't hurt for them to make a few well-needed changes. Let me start by saying they have the biggest and best shrimp, mouth-watering filet, and the most bomb swordfish I have ever had. The soup is AMAZING--and I find tofu to be repellant but in the soup--perfection. Regardless of which entree you decide on, you will get more than enough food. If someone at your table happens to order shrimp, they will bring extra and give everyone at the table shrimp as well. I've been to Kobe probably 25 times, and without a doubt the chef's know what they are doing and I haven't seen any slip ups with the utensil tricks and/or fire. On point with the entertainment (some better than others but all great, nonetheless). My favorite cook there is a white kid (the minority, what a surprise amirite?) and want to say his name is Kyle. He's super professional, generous with the Sake shots while cooking, and never seems to have a bad day even when under obvious stress by the chefs being understaffed. That was the problem on our most recent visit this past weekend. Usually when they bring you the yummy tofu and spinach soup () and salad, the cook arrives at the table soon after. Unfortunately, our full table had to wait for OVER an hour, probably closer to 2 hours for a chef. My friend Tyler and I had time to drink probably too many Sake Bombers (the waitress brought us very dirty glasses with them-ughhh--I had to get up and exchange them for CLEAN glasses at the sushi bar), soup, salad, and even ordered, waited on and consumed 4 different types of sushi..I recommend the Rainbow Rolls btw- delicious!! The Las Vegas Rolls are gnarly, but that's just my personal opinion. Eel sauce is Ipecac. Also, shouldn't water come to all customers automatically? If you want water you have to order it. I just find it weird considering we are in AZ-- water should be a default move for any dine in restaurant. We waited for so long it was ridiculous. Even though the waitress had good intentions, she annoyingly came over countless times to apologize for the wait (stop apologizing lady...we get it--we are drunk and hungry, where is the food??) She asked probably 5 times and tried to take my soup and salad even though I kept telling her \"no don't take it yet\" I was eating slow to not fill up. Grrrrr....this was a Friday night, so needless to say it was packed with only one or two chefs at most for the ENTIRE place. The last thing I'll whine and cry like a bitch about is the waitress looked annoyed when I apparently had the audacity to ask her to box our leftovers. Because of her, I now believe that I can audibly hear people rolling their eyes. This place is the exception to the whole \"service trumps the food\" thing. It gets 4 stars because they could probably punch me in the jaw and I'd still come back...it's THAT good. But seriously Kobe, in regards to the shortage of chefs, please have some on standby or a backup plan. Doesn't matter, I'll still go back.",

When we walked in, we were greeted with the typical Teppanyaki smell, which I guess should be expected in a Japanese steak house, but it is still gross.  We were seated immediately at 7 on a Friday night and promptly served, which is good because the food was not worth waiting for.  The sushi was mediocre and the teriyaki was drenched in sauce instead of tastefully seasoned.  Everything we ordered was completely eatable, but not good enough for the price.  This restaurant would get 4 stars if it were cheaper.",

The waitress who was suppose to be supporting the table for water etc disappeared and we were left without water for 3/4 of the meal. She never even checked in on us (and it wasn't busy).

I had made a reservation in advance, so they were perfectly aware of the large party. Not to mention, there was ONLY one other table in the entire restaurant eating.   We saw our server maybe once, possibly twice when she asked for our drinks and then brought us our check. We all had empty drinks for probably 20-30 minutes. I was disappointed because I had brought so many close friends and family here, in hopes of having a fun dinner.   I truly am never one to complain and always give the benefit of the doubt (I use to serve) but this was awful. Not to mention extremely overpriced.  Overall all, don't go here!!",

    "text": "Do they really want me here?  So my husband and I stopped here one evening approximately 45 minutes before they closed, as soon as we came thru the door they made sure we knew they closed in 45 minutes. Ummm...Okay, I get it, but you're still open, right? Our server was also insistent that we knew what time they closed, he actually rounded it down from the 30 seconds it took to seat us, to them closing in 30 minutes now. So, while our server practically holding the menu in front of our faces, we managed to rattle off some choices. He promptly returned with our drinks and he then asked if he thought at that time we would want more drinks, before we finished our first round he brought the other drinks we thought we should order just in case we missed our opportunity later. Our food came out all at appetizer, salads, soup, sushi, and entrees! Once I poured some soy sauce for myself our server came by and asked if I would need more because he's trying to clear his tables now, gathering all the soy sauces on each table to assuredly refill them as his required \"side work\". He offered us to go boxes before we had even had finished our salads. We obliged feeling very rushed we thought the atmosphere at home would be more enjoyable. So,while boxing up our own food the rest of the wait staff essentially carried us to our car. The only reason this is getting 3 stars is because the food is really, really, good. BUT for real this service is beyond a joke.",

The menu includes select appetizers, mini-entrees, salads, soups, specialty rolls, hand rolls and nigiri. And it's literally all you care to eat, just be sure to pace your ordering since there is a small surcharge for uneaten pieces (that you are welcome to take home). It's fun with a group, and there are sufficient non-sushi/raw fish options for people who aren't feeling adventurous. We took my parents when they visited, and my mom was extremely satisfied with the gyoza, teriyaki chicken and salads. Be sure to try the tempura fried mushrooms ... WOW!!! If you're going to order more than one specialty roll, this option definitely pays for itself, just keep in mind it isn't offered on Friday or Saturday evening. Happy Hour at the bar has some excellent drink specials, and always friendly staff.",

They also shoot sake into your mouth before cooking, also entertaining. The food was pretty standard for a teppanyaki place. Overall for the serving size, it was expensive about $20-35 for each dinner. They also have the Kobe beef which will run $40-70 for each dinner.  I think it is good for special occasions but one dinner is not enough food for people with above average appetites. Therefore to not leave hungry, you would need an appetizer, drink, plus the dinner which includes rice, small salad. Possibly also side orders. That could put the price over $50/person which is a little more than what I prefer to get a good meal.",

Because babies should be around flaming stoves.  Anyway, the chef was not Japanese, which always seems awkward since they act Japanese and make jokes about Japan. Although he didn't do much joke making, and seemed out of his element.   The menu did not include any tuna. The steak and shrimp was okay at best. The shrimp seemed under cooked.  I come here because I'm a sucker for teppan, and because it's close. If it was farther away, I probably wouldn't go.",

If you like Sake Bombs, this is a terrific deal.  They have good food specials on Happy Hour too.  The service was great.  Our Teppan chef was a ton of fun, and as an added perk, he had a bottle of Sake that he routinely sprayed into our mouths.  Delicious.  The food was very good.  Like most Teppan restaurants, it's a little expensive, but in my opinion you're paying for the entertainment as well, which makes it all worth it.

    "text": "I had gift certificates to this place and wanted to eat healthier so it was decided that my wife, Kathy R., my grandson and I would head here for lunch.   My wife got the Kobe steak & lobster, Kathy R. got the kobe steak, my grandson got the kobe steak and lobster and I had the kobe steak.  All the meals come with: Miso soup, salad, choice of white or chicken fried rice and grilled veggies. When you go to a teppenyaki restaurant, you don't really go for the food, you kind of go for the entertainment. but this place served Kobe beef. Kobe beef is known for being lean, lower in cholesterol than chicken or turkey. it is known as  Healthy beef? In fact all of us  commented that the steak was so succulent it melted in your mouth.  Kobe has community seating...(The tables are designed to fit 8 people) You are seated next to other parties around the chef and the chef comes by after all orders are taken. Then in addition the chef brings all fresh ingredients to the table and cooks it for you on the spot with various tricks! The show is very impressive.  The \"show\" is the checf who cooks in front of you.  In this case he also pulled tricks with knives and fire to keep us all entertained.  My steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. There is nothing like Kobe Steak. The Miso soup was excellent, the salad was so so,  the grilled veggies were ok. It also came with white rice which I did not eat. I only had a few bites of everything and took a lot home with me for later.    One last thing about the meal sevral people at our table ordered fried rice so  we were given the opportunity to try some since the chef made extra. I must say even though I only had a bite OMG it was good. It had to be the best fried rice I've had in many years.   FOOD:  If you rate the place strictly on food, then it's not that spectacular. But you're not here solely for food. You come here for an experience. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: After we got seated the waitress immediately gave us menus and asked us for our drinks/orders. She was welcoming, and  was always right there when we needed her to be. She was simply excellent,  efficient, and friendly.  AMBIENCE:  Overall I enjoyed the restaurants environment and vibe! Perfect for families and group celebrations! It's pricey but you gotta keep in mind you're also paying for the entertainment and its unique service. CONCLUSION: This restaurant is fun for birthdays, Anniversaries, special occassions, group outings, couples, and kids. It's entertaining and the food tastes great.   RETURN FACTOR: 100% will definitely be back here but only for a special occassion..",

She's an idiot and she is terrible at waitressing. I've had her two times now and both she has been completely incompetent and should not work in this field.   The first time my boyfriend and I went 3 tables got up and left or switched waitresses because of her. She gave us doubles of everything and was so confused as to why that happened and I heard a hostess telling her she did it wrong.   This last time she brought us the wrong beers. I told her, I don't know if they switched the taps or if she just brought the wrong beer. While we were waiting for 10-15 mins to get our drinks, she comes by and asks if we're ready to order and I told her we were both getting unlimited sushi and she says \"oh yeah. Let me get your drinks and I'll be back\" another 10 mins. Then she comes back and since she's so GD slow we tried ordering everything we wanted and in the middle she kept trying to walk away like she thought that was enough. We ordered one appetizer and 2 rolls and 5 sushi. Then she didn't come back to our table for a good 20 mins.. Got the food. Then she disappeared for 30 mins. But once we put the card on the table she was very attentive and wanted to act like she gave a F. I really do not like this woman. And next time we go, if we get her I will just request somebody that isn't a complete idiot.",

Food was OK but not great, our server's attitude was lackluster/disinterested and the show was..meh.  I'm mostly irritated at management's lack of concern.  A bottle of gluten-free soy bottle costs $3.50 and they couldn't be bothered to have some on hand?  I got served a bowl of plain lettuce because they had no gluten-free salad dressing (with the stuff they had on hand, they could have easily whipped up a quick substitute.)    Next time, we will go to Y.C's Mongolian Grill.  Better value, they are very good about diners with food allergies and they're much friendlier.",

I also ordered one sushi roll .  Overall it was a great experience. Taylor was by far the best chef/entertainer we've had at Kobe. I would definitely ask for his table again.",

I was not that hungry but normally lunch special is fast and honestly who has an hour to sit around and wait for food during a work lunch. If I was not with a group of people I walked out a long time ago. Ridiculous",

I've been here a few times and the service is not great and the food always takes too long. Excited for my birthday lunch today with my niece, we were the first customers to arrive at 11:30am. I ordered the chicken fried rice and my niece ordered the bento box. Two items on their lunch menu. I received my entree first and assumed my niece's entree would arrive shortly after. It arrived 15 minutes later. If you don't think 15 minutes is a long time, cook some rice and set it out and you'll learn it will be less than ideal. Not sure why they would not serve the food at the same time. I left a message with the front host to inform the manager to call me and I never received a call.  I will NEVER go back EVER. I work in the area with 2000 other employees and will be sure to inform them of my experience.",

We called ahead of time to see if they can do brown rice on their sushi. They said yes. So we go in and when we order it they say, no they don't. According to them it's something with the way the brown rice is made, the texture isn't right for sushi. Well then how bout you tell that to the several restaurants I've been to that DO make sushi with brown rice. What a load of crock. Food (if you don't want brown rice) was great. But the service was lacking; kinda like they didn't have much clue to what they are doing.",

Thank goodness my husband had made prior reservations earlier that week because they weren't doing any walk-ins.   To start, we ordered white fish and salmon sushimi and the Las Vegas roll. I don't like raw fish, but my husband does and he said the sushimis were good. The Las Vegas roll ... Let's just say I've had better. Don't think I'll be ordering that there anymore. For our teppanaki meal, I ordered the New York steak and chicken and my husband had the New York steak and shrimp. We were also served miso soup, salad with ginger dressing and also shrimp appetizer.   Our chef was funny and very talkative. That was a good thing because we were sitting with 8 other people who we didn't know, so he broke the ice because afterwards we all started talking, which was nice.   Our total bill was $110 not including tip, but I thought it was well worth it. I'd come back again for sure.",

I was afraid I would eventually get bored watching the chef prepare our meal, however he kept our interest making jokes, interacting, and doing food and knife tricks. I highly recommend this restaurant. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you can't be seated until everyone in your group is present.",

The only times I haven't enjoyed this place as much is when I sat at a table and had to deal with the regular waitstaff. So I highly recommend (if your group is small enough, or you're on your own) that you sit at the sushi bar.   My favorite roll here is called the Sunshine roll. It has a bright, light flavor that I have never found anywhere else. The salmon plus lemon is a perfect combination that makes me wonder why no other sushi restaurant has thought of it.   If you're into something spicy, try their version of the Las Vegas roll (it's my second favorite). The fresh jalapeno and dot of Sriracha takes this roll from great to f****** amazing.   Frankly, there is something to be said for a place that consistently puts out the same amazing product without ever slipping in quality. For that alone this place should be recommended.   Though fair warning: this place is not cheap. There are cheaper sushi restaurants in Tempe/Mesa/Chandler but I guarantee that none of them taste better than this place. So if you're willing to lay $10+ down per roll, come here.",

The dinner started off by not getting a chef to our table for over 45 minutes! I felt my night was already ruined, but chef Taylor was a blast and made it quite enjoyable. The food was delicious and prepared exactly how I wanted it. So we then ate our food and asked our server Ana for our bill.   Here is where all hell broke loose, in the course of 30 minutes and 5 different attempts to bring us the prober bills I finally had to request a manager. A young lady came out and labeled herself as a \"half server\" whatever that is. Asked what was the matter. I then explained and she stated she would take care of it. Her taking care of it was a 10% discount. I felt so insulted, not only did I have to cancel my birthday plans but they felt my time and frustration was only worth 10%.   Thanks Kobe for ruining my birthday plans.",

    "text": "Went here for my daughter's 16th birthday on a Sunday afternoon, and had a great time.  The show was entertaining, and the food was (mostly) delicious.  We didn't have to share a table, because there was only one other family there at the time, and they were given their own table.   My daughter and I ordered the lemonade, and it was so good.  She had elderberry (which almost had a sweet tart taste to it),and mine was strawberry (which was a bit on the sweet side, but I like that).    My family did not enjoy the miso soup.  They found it too salty.  I ate it, but it wasn't my favorite.  Besides the miso soup, the only other thing we didn't like was that the restaurant was so dark.  This was in the middle of the day, and it felt almost dungeon-like.  My daughter and I had shrimp with japanese noodles and it was delish!  There was a good amount of plump shrimp.  My husband ordered the chicken, and had it with teriyaki sauce, which he said was outstanding.  My son had the new york strip steak with soy sauce, and he said he loved it.  The veggies were cooked the way we like, crisp tender. We also enjoyed the chicken fried rice.    I like that they give the lunch price at lunchtime on Sunday, as many places charge dinner prices all day on the weekends.  It was very reasonable.",
