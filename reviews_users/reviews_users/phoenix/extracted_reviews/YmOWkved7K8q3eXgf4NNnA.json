    "text": "Man, it was a busy Saturday, lol. I had to give this place a try since I heard so many good things about it. I walked in with a few friends and you actually order first at the back and they bring you the food later. I thought it was going to be where we sat down first then someone takes our order, but that wasn't the case. There was four of us and we got an order of a sandwich, omelet, and two eggs benedict. I got the eggs benedict and it was something new for me. I got to say it was really delicious. I loved it. The problem was that I had an appetite that day so I was still hungry, lol.   The staff were professional and the food came out in a timely manner. I took a sip of someone's orange juice at our table and well, lets just say they serve alcohol and it was quite tasty. The vibe of the place was nice and relaxed. Every one there seemed they were having a good time and it also looked very clean and organized. If the weather was nice or whatever you feel is nice there is an outdoor patio if you like eating outdoors. All in all, place was nice, staff was good, and food was awesome. I will definitely be back here again and if you love breakfast/brunch then I'd say give this place a try!",

Also the price is really good and under $8 for most plates. It is great concept even with the extreme busyness they had on a Sunday morning. I wish for breakfast spots were a hybrid sit down fast food spot. My friend says I need to come back for the farmers benedict so I will return.",

Panicky and nauseous, we summoned our young waitress to attend to our distress. \"This is the banana foster sauce. It is not supposed to be syrupy and this is how it's always been made like this,\" she answered with such composure and disinterest in our seemingly futile concern.   Curiosity dared us to ask how the sauce was made. Returned with the precarious object still on the plate, our waitress proclaimed it was cooked with butter, reduced sugar, triple sac [and cornstarch, alien DNA...].  Lightning struck us as we exited the restaurant in trepidation into the scorching 109 degree heat under the Phoenix sun: we were in Tempe, Arizona.",

My first issue is that they don't offer Egg Beaters as a substitute.  Not a big deal, but I had assumed a trendy place and trendy spot might.  Next, the potatoes that were served to me were absolutely from the day before.  We have all had leftover potatoes and know the difference.  Finally, the restrooms and the soap \"squeeze\" bottle were incredibly filthy.    Unless you simply can not make scrambled eggs on your own, avoid the hype of this place.",

It is also hard to find any empty table to sit; so one of us had to wait for the table while the rest of us ordered our food. This is not a place where you sit down and the waiter takes your order.

This sandwich had some cheese (forgot what kind of cheese) that was really strong.  It over powered the sandwich so I didn't care for it.    My wife had the pancakes.  Banana fosters pancakes I think.  These were really good.  I had half of her order since she never eats all of her food (lucky me;).    We also had a body Mary.  It was a little spicy, the way I like it.   It was not to strong, which to me is good if your having one with breakfast.

But I do love their Killer egg sandwich with gorgonzola. It's always cooked perfectly! I also love their Focaccia Roma Chicken sandwich. Oh, and don't forget the pecan cinnamon roll, it is nothing short of amazing. Even my stepson, who lives in SF (the home of fantastic food) comes here every time he's home visiting, just for the oatmeal and cinnamon roll.  Aside from the food, the best thing about this place is the manager, Daniel! He always smiles and says hello when we walk in, stops by our table to check on us (if he has time). Most of the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful if you need something else, e.g. extra milk, condiments, etc. There's a reason they are always busy...because of the great food and the friendly staff.",

    "text": "NCounter is located on the North end of Mill Ave, near the PHX Metro Light Rail track.  As much as I hate going out to eat on Mill Ave, due to the stressful moments I have trying to find parking, this place is definitely worth it.  The restaurant has a modern industrial feel to it, as the color scheme is black, white, and gray with orange accents. It's very trendy and has a \"underground hipster\" feel to it.  Very appropriate for its college town location.  They have a large patio section surrounded by trees which makes brunch on a February afternoon seem like you're relaxing in paradise.   Service there is very laid back.  You place your order at the front counter, you're given a letter (N.C.O.U.N.T.E.R. which I thought was pretty clever) to bring to your table as you wait for a server to deliver your food.  You serve your own drinks and retrieve any extra napkins or utensils you may need for your meal.  Seating is all first come first serve based, and the restaurant is even dog friendly.  I was really excited to see a cute Shitzu getting tangled up under a neighboring table.   The only thing that I didn't like was the line formation when ordering.  Tables and chairs are set up down the center of the restaurant in an angular position and you are forced to maneuver your way around other guests as you walk to the back counter to place your order.  Even there, space is limited; which results in you waiting in line- standing a foot away from customers trying to enjoy their meal.   Once in line, I was struggling with deciding on an meal.  There is so much variety to choose from.  I got to the counter expecting to see only breakfast items (waffles, pancakes, omelettes, etc) but they also offer a selection of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  For the most part, NCounter is a great spot to visit for brunch if you're in the Tempe area.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and the quick service.  It's probably not something that I would necessarily make the trip for if I wasn't living in the area- but that also comes hand in hand with the fact that I hate parking on Mill. :)",

As the other reviewers have said this place does get pretty crowded, though. Even though it was past noon and it is the summer so ASU is not in session, I still had no choice but to eat at the bar.

The people that think this place is great are the same people I say there wearing skull caps, and bennies as it was 106 degrees out.  Even the set up of this place was horrible! It was way to crowded with table, and it was hard to even walk around. The tables outside are bolted down and so are the seats, so unless you are the size of 6th grader prepare to be uncomfortable.   I get that the metal seats and table look trendy and cool, but it is Arizona and when I can't even touch the table and it is hard to sit....you have made a mistake!  The menu is nothing special and if it wasn't for the drinks they offer this would be a one star place.  If you want to be go some place that looks fancy but fails to deliver then go check it out.",

This isn't a cute little sit down where you can loyter for hours with girl friends. It's located right near ASU and so is pact with college students, super crowded-a bit like an upscale cafeteria. Nonetheless, very dainty and chill. Food is worth it I guess",

Some of my favorites include the chipotle egg burrito and the urban caesar salad but the portebellini sandwich is by far the best thing on the menu!

I ordered the plain and simple. I just wanted basic breakfast. I was very disappointed. The bacon was cold and chewy. The Bagel was hard and cold. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and requested another bagel it was obviously black and still they served it. The poached eggs were perfect. The fresh squeezed orange juice was sitting in a cooler you have to stir it and it was okay just wonder how long it was there. The coffee was okay from the Roasterie down the street so it was stated. Yelp followers  gave so many stars I had to try this but unfortunately my experience wasn't great.  It seems like the specialty items if you're going to try this restaurant are the ones to try.  Well service is lackluster. The servers act like you're an inconvenience. The initial cashier who was training someone never made any suggestions when I told them this was my first experience there and just kind of stood there waiting for me to figure out the menu as opposed to just good customer service and selling it was as if they were just in a cryo freeze until I saw them out with verbiage. I offered to pay for my juice coffee and eggs yet the manager said no it's on us and we hope you come back and try it again. If they place the same type of emphasis on customer service with the wait staff as they do the manager it might have been a positive experience.",

You order at the counter, get a number, and then find a table at which a waiter will come find you with your meal.   I ordered the Original Chop Salad [$10] because the pictures that I had seen of it online were gorgeous. My friend had the Classic Eggs Benedict [$9].  The chop salad is as beautiful as it looks in pictures. It's delicious too. The salad dressing is a light pesto sauce that coats your salad just enough. I hate when the dressing is so overpowering or when the salad is drenched in sauce.   There were some spots on the street available (you have to pay by the hour), so it wasn't too much of an issue.",

Today the French toast was served cold, cold enough that the room temp butter just sat on top, and when spread the butter still just sat on top. Same with the prior two visits.

They remade it and brought it out to me promptly. I am pretty particular, but they were very accommodating during their busy lunch hour.   The service and food quality here are always on point. Definitely my favorite Brunch place in Tempe.",

    "text": "I've been going to NCounter for over a year now, and use it primarily for quick breakfasts that get to include my dog on their patio!    It has become a very popular breakfast spot for weekday mornings, especially for vegetarians and secret drinkers.   I love it as a neighborhood spot, but don't necessarily think one should go out of their way to go here.  It has a great location diagonal from the A mountain and literally across the street from the 3rd/Mill LightRail stop. There is decent parking around and plenty of bike racks outside.   The patio is nice, with misters that are hit or miss, sometimes not on, sometimes too wet and you end up in a wet t-shirt contest, and totally kid and dog friendly.   It is counter service, but they do have runners that bring out their drinks and food, so have a person stake out a prime table while everyone places their orders inside.  I've never had much of a wait for for food, and they always bring out cocktails fast.  Their food is solid, the Farmhouse Benedict is perfect, they have some great bfest sandwiches, their french toast is super sweet, they don't have waffles which is a bummer, but their portions are generous.  Their b-fest cocktails are around $5 and actually a better deal than just buying juice- honestly!  I would say their downfall is coffee- it is terrible. Really terrible. I have to bring my own coffee when I come here, it is really that undrinkable. They don't have any bfest specials so if you come here often enough (and don't eat meat) you tend to get stuck in ruts, so that would be rad to see. Their misters situation can be really unpleasant. Their pastries never really look that appealing- I'm not sure if it is presentation, or what.  Their coffee/tea station is super annoying- you are supposed to grab your own silverware, napkins, drinks, ketchup, hot sauce, sugar, etc.  It is super annoying and a lot of the goods are high up!  While the food comes fast, don't expect clean up to be fast at all.  The runners really slack on cleaning up the tables and so I often have to move my dirty plate to another table to get it out of my face.  Despite these annoyances, I love their friendliness to dogs as my MaltiPoo Chloe likes hanging out here and they always offer fresh, cold water to her. The restaurant is super sclean and they have hosted the Bike to Work free b-fest, which was super awesome and supportive.  This is a solid joint appropriate for a wide range of b-festers.",

    "text": "This place is the TRUTH! This was my second time visiting the Phoenix area, though this time I was in Tempe at the Marriott Courtyard by Mill Avenue. I was concerned if the breakfast spots here were as good as those in Scottsdale, where I had stayed on my first visit to this area.  Over there, I enjoyed one of my all-time favorite brunches at the Daily Dos.  I was impressed that the PHX area did brunch/breakfast as well as some of my favorite stomping grounds in San Francisco.  So, on Saturday morning, after a night of partying and having multiple vodka club sodas in Old Town Scottsdale, I walked from my Marriott hotel in Tempe over to NCounter which I had looked up on Yelp.  I rolled up and, boy, was there a line! But, at 9am on a Saturday that says a lot about the reputation of this place.  After waiting for some time, I finally made it up to the counter.  As always, I was conflicted about whether to go for pancakes or the omelet. I like to load up on protein and go light on carbs/sugar, especially when I travel, so I went with the omelet.  Now at other brunch spots like Daily Dos, and my favorite places in Scottsdale, you could order a single pancake or French Toast as a side.  I didn't see either of those listed on the menu as sides, though I'm not sure if they would have made that accommodation upon request, so I won't dock a star for that.  So, I went with the \"loaded\" omelet, which loaded up on the meats (sausage, bacon, etc), and I had a side of cottage cheese and a cup of coffee.  Service was FAST.  The strong coffee was just what I needed as it lifted up my energy and morale which set me on a path to recovery from the night before :)  It was tough to find seating but I walked out to the patio and waited for a couple minutes and soon found some space.  It was a win because it was comfortably shaded which is critical in Arizona. Unlike DC, where I live, AZ heat is dry so as long as you're in the shade you're good to go, unlike humid heat.  At any rate, this is a SOLID brunch choice with quality food on deck.  This should be your main go-to spot for breakfast if you're in the Tempe area.",

I found this place off of Mill St, right by a Valley Metro stop.   The interior is a mix of IKEA and Chipotle. You order at the counter, get a metal letter placard for your table so the staff can bring out your food, and you fill your own drinks. I don't mind that at all; but it seemed like 75% of the college students coming in were confused about the concept. They would huddle around the registers looking at the menu brochures, look up bewildered at the menu on the upper wall, and then look down at their brochures again. The workers would get frustrated by this and ask over and over, \"I can take someone's order here when they are ready\" to get these kids moving.   Anyway, that's not a point against the restaurant at all--just warning you what to expect.  I ordered the strawberry pancakes and grilled potatoes. I wolfed down as much as I could--everything tasted fresh, and you can tell the potatoes weren't frozen. I didn't find anything bland--the pancakes didn't need any zest to them.The prices are a little on the higher end compared to a diner, but you are getting really good, really fresh food; not frozen, unpredictable crud from a Denny's.",

Their second week being open so I can understand the long ticket times (20 minutes for breakfast), but not the poorly cooked food.  English muffin on the Eggs Benedict was not even toasted, the potatoes were undercooked and lacked any seasoning.  They looked like they came out of a bag.  The bananas on the Banana Foster French Toast were uncooked and not caramelized with any brown sugar.  The French Toast itself was OK, but for $7 and no side it was pretty bad.  The bacon was cool and seemed to have been cooked off earlier and held in a steam pan like at a buffet.  The biggest nightmare was the setup.  I had no idea where to go as there are 3 entrances, none of which access the counter where you order.  You enter and walk through a maze of tables and people to order your food.  I thought I was in the right line and then realized it was people waiting for espresso.  Then when I got in the right line there were people all over the place and nobody knew who was next.  Was there no thought or planning involved in this style of service to handle busy times?  Sauce & Pei Wei seem to have it nailed, maybe they should take a lesson or two from them.  Second star because they offer breakfast cocktails, unfortunately we will not be back anytime soon to try them.",

Hoping for something healthy and light I decided to try NCounter. It was just what we were looking for. Good simple sandwiches (I had a tuna melt, she had a portabella sandwich) with a nice fresh side salad. The bloody mary was spot on, and the Americano was pretty solid as well. Other customers were tearing into some good looking French toast and eggs Benedict, so now I'm super psyched to come back for breakfast.",

    "text": "I personally would have given this place three stars but the yelp scale seems to say that means \"okay\", and when I give three stars I mean \"edible.\"  The people at the cash register were really nice, it's got a good vibe, they've got delicious passion iced tea, the food came out quickly, it's right by the light rail, it's got big windows which was great for people watching (and keeping an eye on my bike outside), and the set up was nice. I found their service concept a little weird (you order at the counter, they give you a red thing with a letter on it, you stick it on the table, get your own drink, sit down, the food is delivered [fine] but it gets weird when it's almost like service starts then - someone asked if I wanted my drink refilled. Not BAD, I just found the concept...strange.)  But the reason I'm only giving it two stars is the food. \"Fresh\" is in their slogan but the food wasn't. I got the Natibomb (I think that's what it was called) at the recommendation of the guy at the counter (that's another thing - everyone there was uncommonly attractive. Again, not a bad thing, but it was noticeable that they want their servicepeople to essentially be eyecandy... just without the skimpy clothes.) Anyway. The natibomb. It has apple and turkey and bacon and cheese, all things I like, all things that can be done in a way that is both indulgent (mmm bacon, turkey, cheese) but refreshing (fresh, crispy toasted bread, nice big bites of apple.) Instead the bread was soggy with butter, the cheese was bright orange (come on, real cheddar is DELICIOUS! Don't give me bright orange!), the turkey didn't stand out, the bacon tasted pretty cheap, and the whole thing was really greasy. Like, had to drink my (very delicious) passion tea to wash the grease down greasy. The apple seemed really out of place and didn't cut down on the grease at all. My salad was kind of overdressed, too, but not horrible.   Which is fine. If you like that kind of food, I think you'll like it there. But greasy food just isn't my taste. If you want a non-greasy yummy sandwich, try Essence Bakery on University & Hardy (they also have fantastic macarons) or The Center Bistro just up the street from Ncounter on 6th & Mill behind the brickyard. Both have local ingredients, too, which is a niche Ncounter isn't going for.   (As an aside, another thing that was strange was how many customer service people were there. There had to be at least 7 FOH staff walking around and while the restaurant isn't small, for something that isn't even full service dining, it seemed really overstaffed. But whatever works for them!)",

    "text": "This place is a joke. Another overpriced fake establishment going for trendiness over quality. My muffin had no flavor other than the undercooked bits of apple that still had the peel on. The coffee was ruined by the non-dairy creamer that was NOT labeled as non-dairy. For a place to have only two pitchers, one of which is 2% milk and the other non-dairy creamer not labeled as such, is unforgiveable. I ordered regular coffee; I knew upon seeing their super-auto poseur espresso machine to avoid any espresso drinks. I also haven't tried their cooked food, but judging by the prices, I don't think I will.  $8 or more for a sandwich is more expensive than Romancing the Bean and most items at Essence Bakery, and it's unlikely to be as good as either. If you want a muffin, walk across the street to Romancing the Bean (located at the base of the KPMG building), if you want good coffee or a croissant, get one of the best ones in the state at Essence (Hardy & University), and if you want an awesome breakfast or lunch, try either. For espresso you'll have to go Cartel Coffee. It's the only good place within a mile of Mill Ave. Whatever you do, don't waste your time or money on NCounter.",

    "text": "Busy & cute little place further down mill ave. In Tempe! Walk up style ordering with seat yourself tables there after (though if you have a big party, you might want to send someone to save a table, both indoor and outdoor filled up quickly). Our food was all around very good; seemed to be homemade apple jelly that came with the toast that was excellent. We asked for an extra plate when the food was delivered & they were out of side plates, we also needed a fork as one of ours fell, they were running low on both since it was so busy but they made up for it with quick alternatives/solutions. The big downside and what brought us from 5 stars to 4 were our drinks from the bar. Screwdriver was very watery, and the mimosa didn't have muddled fruit, which was surprising since it appeared to be a full breakfast bar (there was also no garnish for the drinks) & for the price ($16 for both not including tip), we expected a little more. Due to the style of the restaurant, nobody comes to check on you or we would have said something, didn't seem worth it to get back in the line just to speak to someone. If you're going to spend the money on a drink, I'd try the coffee on the menu or highly recommend a smoothie; I tried \"the hulk\" and it was excellent!",

    "text": "I came across Ncounter because it was one of the only open restaurants in the area I was traveling through that was open before 10 o'clock-- and I'm happy I found it!  I ordered the Portobellini hot sandwich that was filled with artichoke, spinach, portobellini mushrooms and roasted red peppers on ciabatta bread. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor that wasn't lost due to eliminating the provolone cheese and balsamic mayo to make the item vegan. The sandwich came with chips and was easily shareable, but I was hungry and ate it all! If ever in the area I would recommend trying this restaurant, and their Bloody Mary's (great variety).",

    "text": "Ncounter was a great introduction to my weekend trip to Arizona! I flew into Phoenix the night prior without an itinerary but it all worked out!  I'm an early bird and they open at 7 which was perfect!   I ordered their House Request in addition to their Banana Walnut Pancakes. Their portions are very generous! There was so much walnuts cooked into the pancakes and placed on top! The bananas weren't too sweet and it went well with the maple syrup. The House Request has cream cheese and a fried egg inside, tomatoes and onions. I don't eat red meat or poultry so it was nice they had options! The sandwich was so hardy and it wasn't too heavy. They also have a separate espresso bar.  The decor of the place was very modern. There was plenty of natural lighting and wood grain table tops. It is a self serve hybrid kind of restaurant.    There are plenty of metered street parking. I did notice a parking structure that also may provide parking.    Ncounter is located right on the corner. It was easy to find and there was plenty of other businesses around. Given that I had limited time to explore, I only scoped out a fraction of the area.   There is a cool chalk board right outside that I've never seen before that allows anyone to leave a positive message for the entire day. Messages are washed away the next morning.   Overall, I had a great experience. The food was delicious, the facilities were clean and the service was good. I would come back again on my next visit!",

    "text": "Seriously not impressed.  3 of us went all ordered different items and it was mediocre at best. I was the only one who liked the flavor of  my meal and everyone's food was cold and unimpressive.   It took at least 20 minutes to get our meals. And it a counter order joint so u expect a bit of a speedier delivery epically  for breakfast. Idk how servers make tips or money here but that could be why it was slow idk.   The coffee bar only had milk to offer no cream and I have a hard time with pump pots being used for dairy products....those inside parts don't come apart and there is no way they are ever 100% clean of dairy residue. Coming from a veteran of food and beverage....I would steer clear of that and ask for milk or cream on the side.  My chai tea was fantastic but it took almost 10 mins to get. I was also impressed that when I told them I didn't like melon they brought me out pineapple and strawberries  with no hesitation.    Items ordered: Morning  glory - the enjoyed meal  Keep it simple - all items were cold and the potatoes were mushy. French toast- huge portion but lacked flavor and creativity   It's a cute spot and I'd stop in for a coffee but would probably skip the food.",

    "text": "I'm always looking for breakfast/brunch options around town, so when I heard that NCounter had recently opened, I checked out their menu online and I was sold; I knew I had to go try it out.  It looks like 16 or so others beat me to the FTR and they've only been open for a week, so I guess there were plenty of other people excited about this new restaurant opening as well.  I'm being very honest in giving a three star \"A-OK\" review, but I'm optimistic that after another visit or two, I'll be bumping it up.  The first thing I noticed is that NCounter is located in a very convenient corner location off of Mill and 3rd St (right off the light rail).  Next off, their hours: 7am - 3:05pm daily.  Interesting!  Upon walking in, I was greeted by a bunch of friendly servers...  I love the fast-casual concept where you order at the counter (hence the name, I suppose) and then get your drink(s) on your own but then your food is brought to you... I was torn as I looked at the menu as there were a handful of items that sounded good to me.  My internal dialogue went something like this:  \"Mmmmm... smoothies!\"  \"Oh wow - they serve espresso and amazing sounding coffee drinks too - very impressive but I'll skip those today since I'm avoiding caffeine while being prego.\"  \"Bloody Marys, Mimosas, Screwdrivers, Greyhounds, and more...\" I'm for sure coming back for one of those after this baby comes!\"  \"OK - back to the food menu... those wheat germ granola pancakes sound like they'd be right up my alley!\"  \"But maybe I should just go for an omelette?\"  \"That bakery case looks pretty damn appealing too with cake pops, muffins, pastries, and more...\"  After much of the above debating, I decided to order a fresh squeezed OJ and a Greek Omelette with egg whites and no onions.  For my side, I went with whole grain toast.  I grabbed my OJ and an iced water and found a table... and despite the restaurant being packed, our food arrived within 10 minutes.    Here's where my constructive criticism comes in for NCounter:  -A couple of onions got thrown in there, but that's forgiveable.   -I suggest toasting the bread a bit more if you're going to call it toast; mine was not toasted! -The verbiage that is listed with the Omelettes on the menu says \"with your choice of toast, potatoes, fruit, cottage cheese or tomatoes.\"  So I assumed my omelette would come with my choice of one of those things.  It actually came with potatoes as well as the toast I asked for, which was a bonus, but I would've prefered to order toast and fruit or toast and cottage cheese! -The artichokes on the omelette were cold but the rest of the omelette was hot - just kind of a weird combo with each bite.  Aside from the above complaints, my food was good and considering they've only been open a week, I had a very positive first experience here.  Overall, this place is awesome and a welcome addition to the hood!  I can't wait to go back soon and try those pancakes... or perhaps a smoothie?!",

I will definately be back..",

    "text": "10/15/2017 Yelp review Breakfast and Brunch Ncounter 310 S Mill Ave, Ste A101 Tempe, AZ 85281 (480) 968-9288  I went to Ncounter last Sunday morning with my boyfriend. Before we went, I checked reviews and pictures on the Yelp. By looking at postings, it is a traditional brunch restaurant. It serves omelets, pancakes, waffles. All foods look delicious, and we decided to go and check this highly-reviewed brunch place. When we arrived, we saw the restaurant was full. It provided indoor and outdoor seating. We were confused first when we went in because no one seated us. I think they should put a sign on the front door so people who come at the first time will not be confuses like us. We had to see what other people do, and follow them. Customers order at the counter and find seats by yourself. Probably because it was Sunday, there were no vacancy tables. We had to wait at the bar to see if any one left. So do not go there at weekends if you could. The environment of Ncounter was pretty clean and bright which gave us a great mood on the weekend morning. There were blackboards with hand writing and drawing on the wall. I think it is fun stuff. Also, it had a long black table inside which convenience group of people to talk and eat. It is pet friendly (patio only). I love to see sweet dogs when I eat. My boyfriend ordered a burrito and smoothie, I ordered loaded omelet and iced latte. My boyfriend loved his smoothie. It was blueberry smoothie with peanut butter. He said it was not too sweet for a drink and the flavor of blueberry was not covered by peanut butter. I am not a fun of peanut butter, so I will not comment on that smoothie. The latte I ordered was $4 or $4.5. I think it is not worth that. It was too bitter and I cannot taste the milk. I will buy Starbucks next time. The burrito and omelet were just ok. They putted too much cheese on it. We had to get rid of it before we ate. My omelet contained ham, sausage, and bacon with side of fried potato. The size was big for me, I had to take out the left. My boyfriend thought the size was not enough for man. He ate some my omelet at the end. One thing I have to complain is the waiting time. My boyfriend and I almost waited half hour for our food after we seated. Servers perhaps took so much time to find where we were seating.  Maybe they should hire more servers at weekends.  Moreover, Ncounter provides drink bar with coffee and different types of drinks. Besides the drinking bar, there was a table with hot sauces. It is cool that gives customers more choices and saves more time for both servers and customers.  The location is great as well. It is located on the Mill Ave, the center of Tempe Downtown.  Also, it is beside the rail train station, which is convenient for people who don't drive.",

I immediately called when I got home and realized I had left it, and the man that answered asked me to describe it and then confirmed that it was at the restaurant. He set it aside for me and asked me for my name and told me I could come pick it up. When I got there, I went to the counter and asked for the water bottle by name and someone went back to grab it, saying she had seen it there earlier. She returned saying that it wasn't there with no explanation, and was not willing to look any further. I like this place, and i'm bummed that one of their employees stole something that they said would be set aside safe.",

I told the busboy who promptly took them away and got a new short stack cooking for me. They brought me a cinnamon roll to snack on while I waited. This is the only \"bad\" experience I've ever had and it doesn't even qualify as bad, as they took care of me.   The patio is also dog friendly",

Waiting for any recommendations, I ended up just getting a salad to go. He did not smile nor did he say \"thank you\".  I pride myself on being a great tipper and for the first time ever I did not leave tip.  As I waited for my order, I watched him interact with other customers and he immediately came to life when a couple of young Caucasian women approached his counter... thanks, smiled, eye contact, etc. Next I saw a young Black gentleman approach the counter and his whole demeanor changed, in fact this young Black man appeared to be mentally disabled and was having some difficulty.  I watched and saw how the guy working humiliated and dehumanized the customer... laughing and joking with coworkers at the customers behalf. When in town I will not come back to this place, I'll spend my money at an establishment that treats everyone with dignity and kindness. In the end the food was just ok, nothing special.",

The layout reminds me of places I've gone to out in San Francisco. However, even though the ambience was nice on the inside and outside the food was definitely below average. The eggs were good; It's not too difficult to ruin eggs. But the pancakes, which is a signature component of the meal, were very bland. They didn't have any flavor whatsoever. It literally tasted as if the ingredients were the staple ingredients for basic pancakes. I was also unimpressed with the syrup; the thinner, the better and theirs was average. Overall, I may beating this place up and. It taking into consideration it's located in the middle of a college town. But I wasn't impressed. The staff was very friendly and helpful!",

I have only tried the poached eggs dish and the scrabbled eggs with potatoes, toast, and bacon. Both dishes are great and simple. I am excited to go back and try something a little more adventurous on the menu the next time I am in town.   I have been to a couple other breakfast spots on Mill Ave and N-Counter is by far the best. They have a great menu to choose from, a bar with decent drinks, speedy service, and a beautiful interior. You walk in and place your order at the counter, so this is not a traditional sit down restaurant. I would suggest having someone in your dining party grab a table while someone else places the order.  Tip: I would highly recommend trying the Arizona Gunslinger hot sauce they have. It is awesome!",

I had the Farmer's Market, which was an Egg Benedict, topped with a poached egg, avocado, tomato, spinach and of course the hollandaise sauce, plus a side of potatoes. I thought that it was good the only thing I didn't like was that my meal was drenched in the hollandaise sauce. It was just too much for me.  My sister ordered the French Toast with Whipped Cream and Strawberries and BOYYYYYYY did it look & tasted AMAZING!   If anyone is around the Mill Ave area, you should definitely try this place out!",

First, the muffins came w/ apple cinnamon jelly. It was So good. Their potatoes were the perfect mix of crunchy and soft, and the omelet, oh man.

I feel at some point if a place gets this busy they need to find a way to better secure tables for people who are actually eating their food. I watched at least 4 tables be taken by people who just wandered in off the street and didn't order a thing.   Aside from the pure insanity, the food was pretty good. It was decently priced, they gave out fair portion sizes. The staff was as attentive as you can be with how busy they were. I had no negative Ncounters (get it?) with staff so that was a plus. Overall a good experience with good food.   I'm not one for big crowds generally so I don't see myself coming back in the future. But if you want a trendy Brunch spot on mill this is a good bet..",

This place had a line almost to the back of the cafe, & seating was limited so one of us had to swoop in on an empty table and sit down while the other stood in line to order.   Once we sat down, it took forever to get our food. When it finally arrived, it wasn't what I ordered. And we had no silverware. Or condiments. So I'm waiting on my meal, my mom is sitting there trying to be patient and not eat without me. The saving grace was that my food was yummy once I received it.   This was a Sunday morning/early afternoon, so I get that it's going to be busy. I'd like to come during the week when it isn't so crowded.",

I enjoyed my sandwich and loved being able to pick and choose from many options.  This place is self seating. When we got there at 9:30 am, there was no line and just a quick 10 min wait for the food. There's metered parking right in front of the restaurant.

I'm not a bene girl, mostly because I don't like ham... But how can you not like hollandaise? Which is why this veggie option is perfect for a gal like me! Spinach, tomato, avo, eggs, and hollandaise on a english muffin. It was delicious! Maybe a little less spinach next time as they piled it on there, but that's quite an easy fix. I also had a brilliant iced almond milk latte. I never have tried their coffee before, and I really enjoyed it! So glad it's finally patio szn! I can't wait to go back.",

NCounter is just a solid sandwich and salad cafe (correction: it does actually serve breakfast food like omelets and all that jazz) that brings your food to your table. The flavors are great and not too overdone. When I went I had a sandwich (forgot the name) and I was extremely impressed by how tasty it was. And the price? Honestly, I've paid about the same amount of money--if not more--on crappier restaurants down the street, but none of those dishes could ever compare to NCounter's sandwiches/salads!   If I had time to go back here, I would. Seems like this place is always busy, though, and with a limited amount of time for lunch, I can only enjoy this place once in a while. So sad!",

    "text": "I was very excited to learn that the owners of TC Eggingtons in Mesa, AZ were opening another restaurant and this time in Tempe. I went to high school and college with the owner's daughter so I know the family and how great they are. The same love and passion that they put into their restaurant in Mesa, which has more of a country feel to it, they've put into this very modern and edgy spin on breakfast and lunch.   The first time I came was opening weekend for breakfast. After getting a feel for the restaurant we realized that you order up front and then take your order number and find a seat. We elected to sit at their coffee/booze bar and ordered Blood Marys while we waited for our food. The Bloody Marys were awesome with just enough spice to give them a kick, and the perfect amount of alcohol. When our food was ready, which literally only took 10 to 15 minutes to come out despite it being packed, they brought it out to us. I went with a chipoltle breakfast burrito and it was absolutely delicious. I felt it was a little on the small side because when I was finished I still wanted more. My girlfriend went with an omelet and it was just as delicious.  My next visit was to try their lunch and while good it didn't have the same wow factor that my breakfast did. I had ordered the Turkey and Avocado sandwich,  can't remember the exact name of it, and it was good. It tasted exactly like a sandwich I would make for myself at home. It was on regular 12 grain bread, had turkey, avocado, lettuce, and tomato on it. Very simple sandwich and it tasted that way. I was hoping to get an iced latte as well, however all they have is milk and soy milk. I've come to really love my iced latte's and mocha's with almond milk as a substitute. I don't take in dairy and as a male I try to avoid soy so my options are limited. Vanilla Almond milk really takes an iced latte/mocha to an all new level. I decided to go with the unsweetened jasmine green tea and it was some of the best tea I've ever had. Despite my disappointment in their lunch and lack of non-dairy options I will definitely be back to NCounter.",

I was very excited for a new BREAKFAST place to be in Tempe since there are like NONE!~  I ordered the Farm Fresh eggs bene and my wife ordered some omelet, not sure which one and 2 OJ's. $26 later. We got our food fast. The Eggs were done almost perfect!! I was impressed! I am a big stickler for my Eggs being done properly on Eggs bene. They were almost right, just a bit too hard though but the yolk did run! The food was decent. It was not amazing. The potatoes were good but seemed like frozen type. Had a very garlic powder taste to them. I give them just an OK in my book. They should have put some fruit on the plate too. For $8 bene put some fruit along with the meal. Better presentation and well heck I wanted some fruit with my morning bene!  Wifes Omelet  was very good. Some spots were over done on omelet. Thats OK, hardly anyone gets Omelets right except for Zinc Bistro!  It was good.  Great place. I would give it some more time to weed out bad employees and get things really going with their new place. I would not write it off yet.I can see this place sticking around for awhile unless they screw it up and let it go downhill.  I am hoping for the best with this place. I will go back soon and hope for an improvement in their score.",

    "text": "Great breakfast and lunch spot. You would want to go here for dinner, too, but it closes at 3:05 p.m. I've wondered why it's 3:05, but I decided that maybe it's to give you 5 minutes to get in at the last minute. If not, oh well that's just my speculation. I have found it difficult to order because everything on the menu sounds good. I have eaten and loved the Banana's Foster French Toast, the Loaded Omelette and the Turkey Pesto on Focaccia. Yum Yum Yum. Oh I almost forgot I had the Blueberry Blast Smoothie and it was delicious- pretty much everything is good! They are also right next to the light rail. I like that A LOT! But beware, it's always busy, so it might not be a good place if you literally only have minutes. Another plus, is the patio is dog friendly. The patio is my favorite place to sit because of the great people watching opportunities on Mill Ave, but I wish it was a little bigger.",

On a recent visit to NCounter, I ordered a simple breakfast of eggs and a side of fresh fruit.  What I got concerned me to the point of asking one of their employees--fruit tasted acrid, of preservatives and like no fruit I want to taste again.  I learned from a manager/owner that contrary to their constant use of the word \"fresh\" on their website and branding, their \"fresh fruit\" comes out of a can. I understand that this is the unfortunate reality in many restaurants...those, however, are restaurants that do not (and will not) receive my patronage.  NCounter can do better. Until then, I won't be returning. I have no respect for a branding message that is not upheld in their product.",

The ambiance was great, place was nice and clean...and there was plenty of cute ASU girls in there...but that wasn't enough to distract me from how awful the food was. I was under the impression that this was a good restaurant for light, healthy fare, but that really wasn't the case. For $12 I got a tuna melt and potato chips. The tuna was more like coleslaw, and there was so little of it that I probably could have stuffed the entire portion into a shot glass. The bread was soggy with grease and butter. There was so much liquid that I could have filled a cup and drank my lunch. Gross. I would have ordered something else, but the line was much too long and I had a limited amount of time. I actually ended up stopping at a place around the corner to pick up a 2nd meal that I could actually eat. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. My friend got the cobb sandwich and wasn't thrilled with his either. Maybe I'll try again with the breakfast.",

Been there twice now cause the location was close to the hotel but being a real coffee lover,  sooooo disappointed to discover that they can't provide the usual gibraltars, flat whites, and machiatos we expect from cafes and restaurants now.  The first time my espresso came out in a 12 inch paper cup so virtually a dribble in a cup. The second time, when the waitress had no idea what a gibraltar was, I ordered a small Americano, only to have it taste like a weak french press. No crema, no strength,  no flavor.  Such a shame for the business to have invested in a commercial espresso machine only for them not to make the most of it.",

There was relatively fast turnover, but it's annoying having to cherry-pick someones table hoping they'll leave after their last bite. But, being a Saturday morning, being busy wasn't a deal breaker.  When I received my omelette, the cheese was partially melted and rather tasteless. The eggs were rubbery like something you'd get at a cheap buffet. The potatoes were OK, but didn't compensate for the rest. Overall, the portion sizes were small and the food was just mediocre. I'm not a picky breakfast person, but I would rather go to Denny's or IHOP than come back to NCounter.

(no syrup needed for these delicious waffles!)  *The Pear: this is an omelet with bosc pear, havarti cheese, almond slices and bacon. (You may be thinking, as I did.....pear, eggs and cheese? Don't miss out on this combo, it's outstanding!)  They do offer GF options too if you need/prefer. I have yet to try their lunch items because of all the breakfast options. I hear that the Smokehouse Avocado Stack is a must try item! No doubt, I will be back in very soon. Prices are great, happy employee's but the service is a little slow. I attribute the slow service to the fact every time I am in this restaurant it is crazy busy, so just be prepared to wait a little bit.

    "text": "My main thought: If you go here, get the french toast.  I run past this restaurant frequently and I always see people eating thick, decadent pieces of french toast, draped sugary toppings and topped with a mountain of whipped cream.  I love whipped cream, if socially acceptable, I would use it as salad dressing.  So, in retrospect, I should have ordered what I knew would come with whipped cream, and therefore, be fantastic.  But, I was an hour away from attending my daughter's preschool graduation, where I knew there would be cupcakes and cookies and ice cream (and maybe even whipped cream), so I wanted something semi-light and semi-healthy.    I was pleased to see an eggwhite omelet on the menu (it makes for easy ordering) and it sounded tasty - paired with avocado, tomato and cilantro, three foods that I adore.  We sat outside on a beautiful day.  As far as environment goes, I give this place 5 stars. It is great for people watching and you can SIT AT A BAR! for breakfast.  We opted for an outside table, right next to a girl who was eating breakfast with a baby pig sitting in her lap.  I must say, I have never ate my bacon while sitting next to a pig before - that scored a point for ambience.  Anyway, my omelette arrived  and it was very mediocre.  There was literally half an avocado embedded in my omelette, and while I do appreciate the fact that they are not stingy with the delightful green fruits, it was barely chopped and I like my avocados in manageable, bit size pieces or slices.  I ended up giving the massive chunk to my husband, who devoured it one bite.  I splurged and got potatoes (instead of fruit or cottage cheese) but they were sub par.  They were not browned and crispy, but rather yellow and soggy.    Don't get me wrong -- the food was not bad -- I just would not order that omelette again.  But really, shame on me for not ordering what I knew would be awesome: the french toast.",

Every occasion I've eaten here has seen me wait 30+ minutes, even get close to an hour, even though, everytime, I was one of only five or six patrons in the establishment. I understand you food is great, and that takes time, but it doesn't take 45 min to make a grilled cheese. In fact, I'm writing this as I still wait for food, and can see employees just hanging around in the back. I've worked in a restaurant so I understand the importance of quick service and urgency and there isn't any. The servers are incredible nice and I do enjoy eating here, but it can be unbearably slow at times.",

I am always on board to try new things.  We pulled up, walked in and I am immediately impressed by the number of people in there enjoying their brunch. I look up at the menu and I am also really happy to see the wide range of things to try. After this trip I want to go back and try them all. This time, though, I decided on one of the \"Almost Fried\" sandwiches called House Request. It sounded so interesting with multiple types of veggies and with olive tapenade (WHICH IS MY FAVORITE) and cream cheese with an over easy egg. It was so good. I also got a side of the grilled potatoes. They were delicious. My friend and I decided brunch wasn't brunch without some morning cocktails, she got a bloody mary (and since she'd been here multiple times before, she already knew she loved them) and I got a mimosa and it was so good!   Needless to say, I will be back to NCounter to try all of the wonderful things on the menu. Especially that Pecan Cinnamon Roll. It looked so good!",

All I can say is WOW! My boyfriend had a veggie, egg breakfast sandwich. I tried the spinach eggs Benedict, breakfast potatoes and the red velvet waffles. Everything we ate was excellent. He actually said, \"this is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had! It has everything I love on it.\"  The waffles were magical! Like a desert or guilty pleasure. I love my eggs Benedict as it was perfect in every way.  The vibe was cool and laid back, good service, great location and perfect food. I've added this to my list of go to's when I'm in Tempe!  Pure perfection!!!!",

I also ordered the Melon Patch cocktail. This wasn't anything amazing to it.   I really like this place a lot. The food is good and I like their outdoor patio and the fact that it's dog friendly so I can take my puppy. They'll even bring out a bowl of water for her.

The prices have been raised to not such a good value anymore. The pigeons/birds ____ all over the patio. You order food only to sit and watch 5-6 people that were behind you get theirs before you. The icing on the cake today, their POS system is down so they were turning business away. You mean to tell me you don't have a back up plan when your registers go down !?!? I know why do I keep going back ? Well honestly My Co-worker was in the same frat as the owner and I thought if I mentioned the decline to him it might get better. Pfffft they don't care. Today was it for me. To many other breakfast spots in the area now seek other options",

So it appears that the place never settles down and is always busy no matter the time of day nor season.  Food is amazing! I never know what to order because it's an extensive list and everything sounds tasty. Then I have to ponder the drink menu- mimosa? smoothie? Cartel cold brew? Hair-pulling decisions to make! The last few times I've ordered an omelette plate with potatoes, just love the simplicity of it. Friends also have noted love for their breakfast burrito and smoothies! They have a fairly simple bar menu for those who need a drink with brunch. The mimosas I've had are nothing special, almost too much OJ and not enough champs.   Their people are great too. Anytime I walk up to order it's always been with a smile and a pleasant non-fake greeting. Recently the only free table was slightly dirty, but the manager came by to clean it up and apologized for not being quick enough.   Definitely worth the time and money to visit here!",

Now the pancake order was a JOKE. All 3 pancakes were ridiculously burned and were promptly thrown out. I have included a picture of the pancakes.

First - you place your order at a counter all the way in the back of the restaurant and then pick a seat and they bring your food to you.   The line situation is a little bit confusing because they have \"order here\" and \"to go orders\" right next to each other behind a  stanchion so you get the awkward \"I was standing in line here\" when people who are \"regulars\" zip up to the line and then try to cut the line of five or so who formed a line behind the register assuming that to stand horizontally along the counter would imply they were \"to go\" orders   When you order your food and drink you are told it will be brought to you but if you want cream or sugar in your coffee they tell you that it's at the beverage counter (so you have to go back inside after being seated to get the coffee the way you asked at the counter)  Our food came to us cold so that was disappointing.

The turkey sausage was also a good side - although it was actually 3 patties, rather than a sausage link. Overall, it's a nice casual place for brunch right on Mill Ave; just make sure to get here outside of peak hours if it's hot outside and you want to find a seat indoors.",

I ordered the Killer, which consisted of bacon, Gorgonzola, tomato and eggs, sandwich style.   It came with a delicious small mixed salad on the side.   Soooo good!   The Croque Monsieur  consisted of grilled artisan sour dough, tomato, black forest ham, mustard sauce, Gruyere, 2 eggs.  Another outlandishly flavorful breakfast dish!    I have two suggestions: 1) move the drink bar - it becomes crowded and loses its flow.; 2)  Install shades - all the customers facing towards the windows were experiencing the same issue - sun in their eyes.  Other than that, expect tasty food and great service!",

    "text": "This place got pretty good reviews So I picked it for Saturday brunch. I was a bit surprised by the set up which wasn't mentioned in any recent reviews so that's one of the reasons for my 4 stars. You go up to the counter to order your meal and drinks and then they're brought to you. While I understand this, I'm a little old fashioned in that I prefer a server. Regardless, the food and drinks were wonderful. I had a Screwdriver, biscuits and gravy and some kind of eggs Benedict. All was very good and filling. Honey got an omelette, a Bloody Mary and split my biscuits and gravy. We couldn't finish everything so planned on taking food home with us which leads me to the other reason for the 4 star rating. When it came time to get a to-go box, I waited for a runner to come by. 2 or 3 were back and forth while one was talking with his buddy. For 15 minutes or so, no one even looked our way. Finally, a young man came by. Overall great place though.",

    "text": "Perfect fit on Mill Ave. I'm surprised it took this long to get a cool little breakfast/coffee bar on Mill, considering the amount of hangover breakfast traffic the area gets with ASU right next door.   I've been a few times and have been rather pleased. The food has been great, and they do a nice job with their presentation which gives the experience that extra bonus. The atmosphere is engaging, artwork on the walls, some cool old architectural sketches, and some nice color highlights and tasteful touches. The coffee was fine, nothing amazing but by no means sub-par. I honestly opt for the smoothies when making my breakfast trips, I take care of the coffee at home before hand.   Only complaint: when it gets busy things tend to fall apart. I've been there a good handful of times now and they are definitely gaining momentum. The only problem is when it gets out of hand and the line is out the door, food takes a while and sometimes comes looking rushed or even cold. Honest mistake though, it gets pretty packed in there.   Overall: perfect breakfast spot for a late start on a Saturday. Conveniently located next to a light rail stop as well.",

    "text": "I decided to meet my friend for lunch in Tempe as her work is right off of Mill and 3rd street. However she gives me a funky address that I type into my iphone (instead of saying, \"hey Tasia, I work on 3rd street, just off of mill) and it leads me on a wild goose chase. Alas, I finally get to the correct destination, park, and walk to meet her in the 113 degree heat (but <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweather.com&s=e42df6b6ca6aef233642e0a0e4c7529d225e163dc05ae195d9ddcb4665d98f7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">weather.com</a> says it *feels* like 106, ha!). She asks me where I want to go and I say \"somewhere new,\" which is easy for me because I haven't been on Mill since 2004. She is naming off food joints as we are walking South on Mill, I pull out my Yelp app and quickly type in \"lunch tempe\" and NCounter pops up. I give this suggestion, we stop walking, turn around and look at how far the walk now is (it really wasn't that far, it was just the heat) since I didn't think about this sooner. Just then, she sees a coworker and asks for recommendations and his first choice in NCounter. We look back at each other and decide to go for it.  This place is open Monday-Sunday 7am - 3pm and serves breakfast and brunch foods. The inside was very refreshing with the cold AC, open layout, and tons of tables and chairs, including one nice communal table. They also have a small patio with misters. My friend and I starred at the large menu and decided to split the Potobellini ($8) and the Peppered Italian Salad ($8.50). The Potobellini comes with portobellini mushrooms, roasted red peppers, artichoke, provolone cheese, spinach and a balsamic mayo that is piles on a delicious grilled ciabatta bread and you have a choice of a side salad or chips to accompany the sandwich. The Peppered Italian Salad comes with grilled chicken atop of sauteed cashews, red peppers, and garlic, over romaine lettuce with an Italian Parmesan dressing. The salad was tasty, but they went a little heavy on the dressing which is a total buzz kill for me. Next time I'll ask for the dressing on the side. For drinks they offer anything from alcoholic beverages (served at a smaller counter), coffee, tea, smoothies, and your traditional sodas ($2) and juices. I opted for iced tea ($2) and appreciate that they offer a freshly brewed Blackberry-Jasmine-Green Tea and a Passion Fruit iced tea.  The service was great. The employee taking our order offered up the Peppered Italian Salad suggestion and the employee delivering our food noticed we were splitting our items and brought us out a separate plate use. We also had our table top cleared pretty soon after we finished eating so we were able to enjoy our space and drinks while finishing out conversation before my friend had to go back to work.  We both agreed that the mild sunburn and heat stroke was worth it and that we both will be back!",

After ordering at the counter it took about 15 minutes to receive our food. Service was brisk and efficient and we enjoyed watching the food orders come out.  I had \"The Killer\" breakfast sandwich (bacon, tomato, blue cheese and eggs on toasted ciabatta) with fruit on the side and my husband had chorizo and potatoes with toast instead of tortillas. Both were excellent.  I'm glad to see they're opening new locations because I'd hesitate going to this one during the school year unless it was pretty early in the day.",

IThey had blueberry pancakes on the menu, something I often crave but rarely find (plain ones with blueberry pie filling don't count - blech), so that was my order, along with turkey sausage and a latte.  The latte away fine, nothing special (I like mine with a darker bean I think), the sausage was good, the pancakes were a disappointment. The blame is not entirely on NCounter - I like thinner pancakes. These were really thick, cakey even. Maybe some people love that, it's just not my thing. The biggest issue I had though was that the maple syrup was not only too small an amount for these crazy gigantic pancakes, but it was not real maple syrup. It was obvious from the texture, more like corn syrup than maple. To put fake syrup on such beautiful pancakes seemed a sacrilege.  I brought over half of them home simply so I could eat them with proper syrup.  Lastly, I had 3 bus boys / servers walk past me while I tried to make eye contact to ask for a to-go container. The 4th finally stopped and even though my plate was nearly full, asked if he could take it for me. When I asked for a container he seemed put out. I got my container, packed up my food and left.  I'll give it another try, there were definitely other things on the menu that appealed to me, but for now, 3 stars.",

Here is the list:  Breakfast chorizo burrito-Must have been that good, none left to try.  Croque monsieur actually a madame, with a couple of fried eggs topped a crusty bread.  (My meal)  Eggs Bennie-I had to have a bite of this perfect hollandaise topped creation.  Will be ordering that next time.  Banana foster french toast- the two little cutie pies finished off the sweet topping confection confection of caramelized bananas and whipped cream.  The toast had enough custardy texture inside.  Strawberry and cream french toast- Same French toast as above but covered with strawberries and whipped cream.  Farmer's breakfast-eggs, multi grain toast, bacon (or sausage) and breakfast potatoes.  The coffee, fresh squeezed OJ and choco milk were all good.  Of course, we're looking forward to dining here again!!!",

The last time two times I ordered the \"Farmer's Market\" the eggs were completely hard-boiled and it was served cold. With how busy they are, I am not sure how that happens. So I switched up to the \"House Request\" sandwich and there was about a 1/2 lb of cream cheese on it which is not very appetizing. After I scrapped most of it off it wasn't bad, but I had also obliterated the sandwich.  Maybe I have just had a run of bad luck so I'll stop by a few more times when I get time and see if it was just a run of bad luck.",

    "text": "I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasn't too delicious. If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was \"is there booze???\" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc.  So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food.   I thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. I'm not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I don't think I would be back to find out.",

You walk in and order, they give you a number and bring your food to you.    I had a cup of coffee and a loaded omelet with fruit as the side.  The omelet was deliciously huge and jam packed with ingredients.  The coffee was just average, I mean..it was in one of those metal towers I'm sure it was just old considering it was lunch time.  The place was very open and bright which is always nice for lunch.    I'm looking forward to going back and trying their salad because they all looked great.  Service was fast and friendly, this is a great place to pop into for breakfast or lunch.",

One time I came and the potatoes were a little dry, but other than that, all the food has been great.  I really like the cinnamony jam!   However, if you are real coffee lover, to be frank, they don't really know what they're doing. The other day, I asked if they had half-and-half for my coffee, and they said no, they only have (fake) creamer. When I looked surprised, the barista shrugged and said he'd look into it. Today, I ordered a cappuccino, thinking that would be a safe option. But it was like 10 ounces of milk, with no foam! I could hardly taste the espresso shot. Hello: That is a latte, people. I'm sure that they could do better with the coffee, especially if the customer gives them a little guidance... which I recommend.   Also, don't expect great table service, even if you give a normal tip. I was given an empty cup when I asked for water, and had to retrieve the water myself. Seems like it would have been easy to just fill that cup before bringing it all the way over to me, no?",

    "text": "After eating at Ncounter for my third time since the opening and being utterly blown away, I felt it was necessary that I get on yelp and offer up my opinion on the experience. Now, if you know me, you know I am not the type to get off my butt and go write a review about some food that i ate. Sorry, but I'm just not that proactive about food i guess. So you can guess that if I am taking the time to sit and write this I must be pretty smitten with the place.   You can imagine my surprise when, after logging on to yelp, I see a smattering of poor reviews freckled amongst the five, and four stars I was expecting to see. \"What gives?\" I'm thinking to myself. This place literally has the BEST breakfast that I have ever had. EVER. I mean, I know I've only managed to get my head in there three times since the opening, but those three dishes were BREATHTAKINGLY delicious. I got the Croque Monsieur last time, a hefty piece of sour dough with honey Dijon mustard, Havarti cheese, thick slices of tomato, topped with over easy eggs. Needless it was everything I could have wanted in a breakfast and more.   The atmosphere is the best. I'm 22 years old, so the modern simplicity and buzz really bring in the whole college town feel. The service is always super friendly and energetic, and the music (something the older generation wont appreciate here unfortunately) is sick. They play some of the dopest, most original stuff I have ever heard at a restaurant.   To be completely honest, I have brought several friends to this place and not a single person has let a negative word about it escape from their lips. The place is almost always packed too, which would imply that people are liking it a lot. So to me, these one and two star reviews are a little suspicious. I know competition in the Mill Ave restaurant game is fierce, and a place this delicious, with an atmosphere this inviting to college kids, has the potential to scare competitors. So be wary Yelp users, as people are not always what they seem.   I urge you to try this place. I have been looking for a new breakfast spot near campus to rival those in my home town of Sedona for years. This place does that and more. Can't wait to bring more friends!",

    "text": "I visited Ncounter this morning on the suggestion of some article about the \"Top 10\" places to enjoy breakfast in Tempe. To this restaurant's immense credit, they advertise very well with beautiful pictures, a simple but sleek interior, and great customer service.  On the suggestion of the cashier (which was a good suggestion, I might add), I ordered the pear omelet. It's an interesting but truly workable flavor combo of sliced peers and bacon with a side of potatoes. That beings said:   - Food was unacceptably dry. There are two possibilities as to why: either the chef overcooked my meal, or my meal had been left out for a bit longer than it should have been, which leads me to my next thing  - Long wait time. I went at 7:30 AM; there were about 8 other customers there, most of whom had already been served. My wait time was over 20 minutes, which was probably not necessary.  - Coffee was not good. If you prefer simple, drip, black coffee like I do, you're better off getting it from elsewhere. Always be wary about the self-serve containers. No thermal container adequately masks how long ago a coffee was made, and mine was way too sour. They do have a nice menu of specialty coffee drinks which may be more worthwhile.   I'm disappointed because this place, as I said earlier, advertises very well. Looks can obviously be misleading. However, I am open to coming back another time to give them another shot. Perhaps I'll try their Eggs Benedict next time. Until then, I shall......Ncounter other places (sorry, couldn't resist).",

When our food was delivered he had silverware in his hand but came back with wrapped plastic ware and literally tossed it at us. I looked at others eating no one had plastic and I began feeling unwelcome and less than. Was it because I was the only patron at that time of African American decent? Was it because I was wearing a head wrap? Was it because my company was with an white American male and appeared as an interracial couple? I could only draw those conclusions. Finally I went to the kitchen and asked for silverware and was handed actual silverware so the excuse given to my friend that there was none was not correct. I feel that after spending over $45 for a casual breakfast for two should have been given a better experience and I will be certain to tell all that I know that this is not the place to go for a great experience and meal!",

It's a stand in line, order, then sit down and they bring you your food place but even when the line is long it moves fast and totally worth it. When I sit at the bar Hunter and Caitlin are usually working. They are both amazing. Great customer service, attentive, and have great recommendations!

If you want a beverage other than water, tea, or coffee, there's another line for that, if you want a second, get back in line. If ya love lines, this is your place.  We waited over half an hour, after waiting in line to order, for our food. Table of three, and none of us were very happy with our breakfast. Nothing about it was any better than I could have done at home in less than 45 minutes it took us to get food.  Coffee was really bad, weak and almost flavorless.  Staff was fine, hard to get a good pulse on them seeing how you just order at a counter and then see the person who drops off your food.  Bottom line, for the price, we could have gone somewhere else with a server, and skipped the multiple line situation and the self-serve style. Really bewildered by the popularity of this place, especially since none of us were even impressed enough by the food to return.",

Like most places, there are some delicious menu items, and the other ones are just meh. The mood is great, it feels lively here, being in the middle of the college town.   Starting with the service, I like the idea of ordering and sitting down. It's less frustrating and you get to sit wherever you like. Hope more restaurants are like this. The workers are all very sweet and helpful, so that's that.  With the food, things aren't as good. Their menu is actually really basic, but there are some standouts. I personally enjoy the classic eggs Benedict here, but it's a hit or miss. It really depends when you go and how busy it is.   That leads to the lines and waits. This is why I'm giving three stars, as one time I had to wait 40 minutes for food, which made me late for a meeting. When it gets busy here, avoid it at all cost. The workers seem to lose a sense of organization and it feels very chaotic. So hopefully come here when it's slower, you'll have a good experience.",

    "text": "If you are in the Tempe area and are looking for a killer breakfast with great service and delicious food, you better go to Ncounter. Walking into Ncounter you may be thrown off by how they operate. Most people may think this system is unappealing, but I am here to tell you why every restaurant should adopt this process. First, you grab a menu to read while you wait in line to order your food and drinks (yes, you wait in line and pay FIRST, but bare with me). I know you may think that this goes against all great restaurant's, but here is some food for thought. Have you ever gone to a restaurant and waited for your server to notice your done eating, ask if your done eating, take way too long to bring the check, and then again take too long to process the check since they are obviously helping with other tables? Well, if you hate that inefficient process as much as I do, then you will love this process. The line moves very quickly and you pay FIRST so that when your done eating, you simply leave whenever you feel like it. GENIOUS. The one carveout I have with Ncounter is that it can be difficult to find a table since it is a very popular place, especially on the weekends. If you are in a group, have one person be scoping out a table to hold for the group. The atmosphere is clean, simple, and somewhat modern. With indoor and outdoor seating, you can bring your pup! They also have a bar area inside and outside so if you are there for a quick bite and don't want to wait in line that is another great option! Not only is the atmosphere amazing, but the restaurant is on Mill Ave. Mill Ave is filled with shopping, dining, events, music, you name it. So after you are done eating, you can walk off the food coma and even take a short hike up A mountain to view Tempe from above.  Don't be afraid to order one of their Mimosas or Bloody Mary's, which are well balanced and well-priced between 4-5 dollars. They have a variety of options ranging from gourmet omelets to fluffy strawberry pancakes and waffles topped with wiped cream. When I go to Ncounter, I know I am leaving full. They give generous portions that are very well priced. My favorite dish is the Bono. It is a barbeque, egg, tomato, onion, monster of a sandwich that literally makes my mouth water when the server brings it to me. Not only that, you get a side of perfectly cooked potatoes to go with it, just to make sure you leave full. The food comes out very quickly, usually under 10 minutes (I went for lunch during a work break one day and even got back to work early). The servers are always friendly, however, you don't need much contact with them since you pay first, leaving you to enjoy your company, your food, and not breaking your wallet.",

    "text": "I DISLIKE BEING LIED TO!!!   We arrived this morning just before 9 and there were only two other tables occupied.  There were five in my group with only three of us eating.  We went up to the counter to order and as I walked past the beverage cooler, I grabbed a bottle of milk.  I ordered a veggie omelet at the counter and told the cashier about the milk.  She responded that she had already got the milk (this will come into play later in our experience).  The others in my group ordered and we paid on one bill.  The cashier gave us a metal stand with the letter \"Z\" carved out.  We set it on our table and waited for the food to be brought to us. One of our group members had grabbed pecan roll for his breakfast, so technically we were only waiting for two hot breakfasts.  The first breakfast arrived after several minutes and the waiter did not take the metal stand with the \"Z\" so I believed my omelet was still on the way.   We were talking and visiting and finally one of us commented on how much time it was taking for my meal.  I waited a bit longer then took the metal stand with the \"Z\" on it and asked a different cashier, the first cashier was no longer there, if she could check my order.  She gave me the typical brushoff that they were very busy, and the food was taking a while.  She did not ask when we ordered or what we were missing.  I explained that one of our breakfasts was brought out 10 minutes earlier and I was still waiting on a veggie omelet, and that it was not busy when we first came in.  She looked back at the kitchen, walked over to a plate, came back and said it was on its way.   I went back to our table, where everyone else was now waiting on me, and sat down. I really dislike being lied to; I waited another six minutes, and when my food still had not arrived, I took the receipt and asked the second cashier if I could speak to a manager.  She made a snarky remark, did something else, then went in search of a manager.  The receipt showed that we had waited over 20 minutes for my meal, even though the other hot meal was delivered within six minutes.  The manager pulled up the transaction and said the veggie omelet was never ordered.   I was upset; if the first cashier had been more focused on her job than worried about someone getting away with a free milk, the omelet would have been ordered... AND had the second cashier taken the time to actually check the order, she would not have had to lie to me and say the food was on its way. I gave them two stars instead of one because the manager made it right.  The veggie omelet came out within a couple of minutes of him discovering the problem.  The veggie omelet was good; nothing to write home about.  It had more cheese than veggies.  It was quite light on the veggies.  Honestly, Denny's makes a far better veggie omelet and it comes out in five minutes.",

While you should always tip service-industry professionals, the nice thing about counter service is that you generally don't have to tip as much, saving some money.  This place gets very busy with the Mill Ave. business lunch crowd plus ASU students, so arrive early. It can quickly get crowded inside. The outdoor patio is a better option except in the hottest months (they do offer misters). Sneak around the back side for a quieter table.  Entrees I'd recommend include the Morning Glory Omelette and the Mediterranean Salad, but there are plenty more I want to try!",

My boyfriend and I would go hiking A mountain and after spending hours burning off fat we would go straight to N Counter for breakfast ( located at but not exactly at the base of A mountain)  Enviorment/Location:  To be exact N Counter is located in the heart of Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from ASU  (Go Sundevils!). The actual resturaunt is super cozy and inviting. In the spring/summer we like to sit outside and soak in the enviorment.   Food: I can never go back to I-hop after this place. Food is always fresh, always hot and 9/10 times always  freaking delicious. Everyone I take here, loves it. The portions are also pretty decent.  Service: you pay at the counter so you don't exactly have a waitress but the staff is always friendly and happy. Food is served pretty quickly, so no unnecessarily long waits  Price: I was there two day ago and  got: a loaded egg white omelet,  potatoes, a side of bacon, and a peach Bellini (alcoholic) =$19.50  I would recommend you try!",

Obviously missing the rush because after sitting multiple people walked in, however a multitude of people that arrived after us were getting their food prior to us. We waited over 20 minutes where people who barely sat were getting their food before us. Asked multiple employees to check on our order and we're never gotten back to. We're honestly appalled at this level of customer service. Just received our food while writing this and it's cold? How can something that took 30 minutes be cold on arrival? A few bites in I could tell my French toast was extremely moist and didn't seem cooked through. Asked for the manager and it turns out the person that brought us the food was the manager! Why was nothing addressed? Why didn't we get an apology for the lengthy time we waited? Or any acknowledgement at all. He was rude and unapologetic. For a place that is usually fast paced with delicious food it sure seems they've taken a turn for the worst. Very disappointed with our food choice today",

But they also make one with avocado that is equally delicious. For lunch I highly recommend one to get the chopped salad, truly delicious especially the pesto dressing. For dessert pick from any of the delicious cookies or pastries at the counter. Enjoy a mimosa from the bar to help your hang over on Sunday.  Very trendy atmosphere. Inside can get crowded but there is usually room outside, and in the cooler weather the dining experience becomes quite favorable. Perfect spot for a late Sunday morning or any lunch date. Check it out!",

I got there and I didn't know where to stand apparently I wasn't in the area of the line so the counter guy didn't even acknowledge me. Instead he was waving at some 19 year olds he wasn't gonna get with anyway. Lets be honest.  So I ask him if this is where I stand or do I go over there? He seemed to get visibly upset like his Aspergers flared up.  I thought I would wait for my food there, but he said \"ah you might wanna grab this\" very smart alecy possibly still burnt from my simple question.   Walked to the bathroom after my meal, there was a dude in the toilet. They have sliding glass doors to the bathroom and I had to wait relatively close to the toilet, Low and behold the guy finally gets out and it's one of the cooks. I didn't hear the sink run.  Overall I thought the food was good, I could of dealt less with the spoiled attitude of student staff.",

I recommend going on a day that's nice enough to sit outside, the patio is great for people watching! It is a self-serve cafe so much more casual in nature than other breakfast eateries but the food is awesome for the price you pay. 3 huge, fluffy, perfect pancakes with mix-ins for $6.50. If you love pancakes as much as I do, these are some of the best.   If you're in the 'hood and can deal with the early closing hours, I definitely recommend this place amongst the many 'drab' eateries on Mill Ave.",

I also ordered a coffee. Everything was good but nothing spectacular to rave about. I liked that the food wasn't greasy but the meal was slightly over priced in my opinion.  The guy at the register wasn't sure whether to address me as \"sir\" or \"man\" so he used both which was a bit weird. Haha overall good experience and a good place to come back to for breakfast. Again nothing to rave about but if you want breakfast and don't care to only try places worth traveling for, then you're good coming here.",

I usually call in for takeout because it's always packed. I love bringing lunch home from Ncounter and enjoying it on my patio. I crave it! It is slightly over priced but it's honestly worth it in comparison to other cafes and sandwich places. I personally feel like you get what you pay for. The only things I don't particularly care for is the location. I don't like searching for parking on Mill Ave just to walk into a massively crowded place where you have to shove yourself through the lines just to pay for your to go order. They really need to open another location to accommodate the number of people this place attracts. Preferably another location with a dedicated parking lot.",

Step inside to a very crowded restaurant, but the line to order moved very quickly.  My dining partner and I were having trouble deciding between the benedict, omelette and just plain ol' bacon and eggs.  We both ended  up going with 2 eggs over medium, bacon, toast and potatoes.  We found a great seat on the patio and waited for our food to come while enjoying the perfect weather and people watching. When the food came my dining partner had burnt toast, but that was quickly remedied and all was well.  It was a lot of food and it was delicious, eggs cooked perfect, I realized I should have ordered crispy bacon but it was good nonetheless because cmon its BACON!  They have a bar and offer Bloody Marys and Mimosas which I saw plenty of people enjoying.",

I knew that was a stretch because of NCounter's popularity that we'd get a table at the brunch hour on a Saturday. But luckily, we got a table and we actually sat outside under a space heater and it was just fine. The inside is so modern. We went in December and their Christmas decorations were super cute. We stood in a line that wasn't too long but long enough that I had time to drool over the baked goods window. Mini cupcakes? Damn cutest things I'v ever seen. I ordered the Saturday special which was a plate of biscuits and gravy (I'm a simply gal) and my girlfriends order the much-raved about eggs benedict and an omlette. Let me tell you, for not being a fancy sit down brunch place, that was the best looking omletter I have ever seen.   The bs and gs were great and I got a chocolate milk which totaled to $12.50. Meh, a little overpriced. I have to give NCounter props though, they sell their own merechandise and the branding they have going on is very cool and hip. Plus they have seating everywhere. I'm certain had it been a nice day out the place would have been packed to the rafters.  Can't wait to go back!",

I came here because it seemed popular, and had a pretty good rating on Yelp.... but I really don't understand how... maybe all the ASU kids are impressed by the modern interior design?  Maybe they're sick of their meal plan food?  Or maybe people are just hungover and any breakfast food tastes good...  Anyways...  -The service was awful.   Not one single person had a personality or even a glimpse of a smile.  There was about 20 people \"working\"... but doing absolutely nothing.  Workers were just aimlessly wandering around the dining room, standing behind the counter in a daze, or fist bumping their friends talking about how wasted they got the previous night (no joke).  -The place was a mess. There was food and garbage ALL over the ground.  The drink station countertop was a sticky disgusting mess... spills, lemon seeds, used napkins allll over it.  The place was pretty busy, but any empty table was still covered in the previous customer's dishes and food mess.  (Which I didn't understand since there were 3 workers wandering around the dining room at all times).  I had to flag down a dazed employee and ask them to clear a table off for me.  And of course he just wiped even more food onto the already disgusting floor.  Seriously, food ALL over the floor.  Gross.  -The food took forever and was cold. We waited about 25 minutes for a super simple order of food.  I got the Farmer's Market.  The whole entree was cold.  And NOBODY likes cold soggy potatoes.  It was supposed to have avocado on it, but it had one mere sliver.  My boyfriend's food was also cold, and he didn't eat it.  We would have said something to someone... about a refund or getting at least warm-ish food instead, but everyone was too busy wandering around in a zombie daze, and at that point, I just wanted to get the hell out of that disgusting place.  And there was awful music playing... like music that plays really loud in a club.  Like loud Britney Spears and hip-hop.  It was just weird.    I would never come back here, and would advise anyone (unless you like cold food, disgusting places, and awful service) to try another place for breakfast/lunch instead.  Ew.",

How it works is you walk up to the counter, order your food, and pay/tip right away. They'll give you a metal table number and if you ordered a hot or alcoholic drink, they will attach a laundry clip to it so the bartender can find you more easily. I recommend their mimosa or bloody mary. Great iced and hot teas, as well. Come here before/after a walk on Tempe Town Lake.",

I work down the street and had to check it out after inquiring about good eats in the neighborhood, the traffic it gets on a regular lunch hour is something to gawk at but the vibe is fitting for me and others who are familiar with the Northwest and the \"Portlandia\" mentality.  I had the Natie Bomb Sandwich, because on the website in the gallery section it caught my eye. What is there not to like...  \"smoked bacon, turkey, apple, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, on grilled 12 grain\"  It was calling me...   So, it despite the heavy amount of foot traffic, I found a place to sit outside and enjoy the sandwich with little effort, the turn over time is impressive as well. It is pressed before arrival and comes with a side of chips. If you are looking for comfort food this isn't really the place, but if your looking for creative takes on classics and a great place to just blend in and relax at a middle of the road price range. This place suits that need just fine.",

    "text": "First off, NCounter has such an amazing atmosphere. It's always bustling with students and is the perfect place to meet up for brunch with a friend. It's located right in the heart of Downtown Tempe on Mill Ave and is conveniently located next to the light rail. If you're not taking the light rail or getting there on foot, then I suggest parking in the parking lot behind Hayden Square Condominiums on 3rd Street and Ash. It's open, free, and NCounter is literally steps away!  Now onto the food!!! The food not only tastes amazing, but is beautifully presented. Just by looking at the plate you would never imagine that it only cost $7-$9! Though there are many more that I have yet to try, my favorite as of right now is the House Request plate under the \"Almost Fried\" Breakfast section. The olive tapenade/cream cheese combination is so delicious and the side salad gives a nice balance to the sandwich! The only negative is that the eggs are sometimes a little too runny for the sandwich making it a little difficult to eat, but is still yummy nonetheless. For those who want something more sweet then there are pancakes and french toast that are simple, but do just the trick (or pastries if you want something small). If you're not in the breakfast mood then there are also many sandwiches and salads to choose from. Although this place is always packed I have never waited long for my food and the service is always excellent.   If you are in the area by chance or for some festivities taking place on Mill/Tempe Town Lake, then I would highly recommend stopping by here for a bite to eat. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I wasn't particularly impressed with Ncounter. I had the Killer breakfast sandwich and my husband got the Eggs Benedict. Both were just alright, and not really that tasty. The tomatoes in my sandwich were sliced very thick, which would have been fine if they had any flavor. The ham in the Benedict tasted kind of weird to me, and the hollandaise sauce was extremely bland. The potatoes that came with it though were very tasty though. I also got a peach Bellini, which was not that great. I don't think they used high quality peach nectar. I did like that it came with a gummy peach ring as garnish though. There was also a mix up with food, and long after everyone else in our party had their food, mine was still no where to be found. Eventually I got up and found a manager, and my food came out shortly after. Overall, there are many better places to have brunch and I doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "Keep in mind, you're on Mill Ave - ASU college kid central. The staff reflects this. A bit flighty, some were really nice, though. One guy cleared and rearranged the tables and moved the umbrella so my friend and I could sit in the sun. We didn't get napkins or silverware with the food. I thought that was a bit silly. We had to hunt down the stuff ourselves, despite the fact there seemed to be tons of employees running around. The line was long and despite the large area - indoor and outdoor seating, including a breakfast bar - if you hit it at a hot time, you will have to wait in the cramped space. Claustrophobics beware!   Now for the food. Pretty decent spicy bloody mary, definitely had a good kick to it. I'm a bloody mary fan and for $5 you can't go wrong. As a vegetarian, I was worried the options would be sparse. Not True. I had the vegetarian eggs benedict! They rocked! Never saw anything like that on any brunch/breakfast menus - and I get around. It was exactly what I wanted. Two English muffins, runny eggs (I like using the potatoes to soak up the yolks), fresh spinach, avocado and tomato slices and the right amount of Hollandaise. Wow. The potatoes were tasty - just needed a dash of salt, although I'm a salt hound. My friend had the coffee which he said was ok (but I can't judge for myself, sorry) and he had a more traditional breakfast of eggs, potatoes and bacon. He enjoyed it, though you'd really have to try and screw that one up. All in all the food was yummy and the location is great. Perfect when the weather is nice to sit outside and enjoy!",

The service was also great even though there was a line the man taking our order was patient and answered the questions. The girl who brought our foo offered us sharing plates for the pancakes. And someone even stopped by our table to ask if the temperature was ok and if we needed him to get us an umbrella! We had great food and didn't need to look around at all when we needed something!

The customer service is great. If you don't like something, they will take it back and get you something new...even delivering it to you if you work on Mill Avenue.  The Bad:  Wait times, almost every time I have been there are outrageous. 10 minutes for a smoothie, 25 minutes for a takeout sandwich, 20 minutes when I was sitting, waiting for my food there.   The price. I often found myself paying close to $15 for lunch... and I cannot honestly say I think the lunch I received was worth $15.",

    "text": "So I went to N Counter last week, had a terrible experience! I went as far to write a letter to 3 email addresses listed on their site... and no response. So here it is :)  To who it may concern:       I just arrived back from lunch at N Counter and am still considerably upset at just what happened. I tried to use the contact  us button on your website but it appears there is no confirmation when trying to hit send.    I was able to leave my office and enjoy a lunch date with my boyfriend, which is very important to me since we have conflicting schedules.  We jokingly argued where to eat lunch, I wanted N Counter for your great salads and he wanted to go to Cheba Hut for their big sandwiches... I won.  Since I am eligible for expenses at my job, when I approached the register I told the cashier clearly before ordering that I needed to pay for mine separately and will need an itemized receipt for reimbursement.  I ordered clearly a Fushion Chopped Chicken salad and a soda, he then swiped my card.  I bring up my order because I have had in the past received the wrong chopped salad because I didn't say Fusion, always learn from my mistakes, right?  After swiping my card, he said he needed to wait for my boyfriends order for an itemized receipt so our food was on the same ticket.  I let him know, that's fine as long as my receipt included my food only.  Of course after J ordered, swiped his card and the itemized receipt had all of our food on it.  I was very disappointed, because I was very clear and polite on what I needed.  After he pulled the receipt, he asked if it would be a problem?  Yes, it is actually... that's why I asked twice. So the young man went and got a \"manager\" which may be one of you on this email, he looked at me and said it was not possible to get a different receipt. I explained my needs to the manager and let him know I asked twice,  I was very frustrated to say the least but remained professional.  I then was told by the manger to \" CALM DOWN\".  I was in complete shock, I couldn't believe it.  He said this to me in front of a full line of people, I was so embarrassed.  He put in the order again, with a no make and handed me the receipt and I walked away.  I usually speak up for myself when necessary but I had no words for his behavior towards me as a customer.  We sat down outside, I am trying to shake it off and enjoy the rest of my lunch hour.  The runner brought our food and it was the wrong salad, I questioned it politely and said I ordered the Fushion chopped.  She just stared at me and I felt very uncomfortable, so I offered to take the salad and interest of eating with my boyfriend.  She then offered to get me the proper lunch.  Again I was flustered.  The salad came quickly and was able to salvage  some of my lunch date, when she dropped the salad off we realized we never got the cupcake we paid for on the second bill so we had to ask for that too.  So all in all, what usually is a fantastic  or generally okay experience and a great lunch or breakfast was awful, embarrassing, waste of time and money.  I work very hard for everything in my life, my time is important to me, I treat everyone with respect and kindness and don't deserve to feel how I am feeling this afternoon after leaving your establishment. Next time... Cheba Hut!  Respectfully,  N",

It looks nothing like the coffee shop that last inhabited the space (and that is definitely a good thing).    Flavored iced teas are good, as is the orange juice.

With a large outdoor patio, a beautiful atmosphere and DELICIOUS food, this gem is definitely worth paying for parking.   The Cobb Sandwich is one of the best lunch picks I've ever made. With a side salad, it's the perfect meal. All the sandwiches are tasty, so you can't go wrong. And with a case of sparkly baked goods, you can round off your day with a delicious cupcake or cookie.   Stop by. You'll be so glad you did.",

    "text": "This was not a good experience. The only reason I am giving it two stars is for two reasons. One is for the delightful folks we met at the restaurant in order to not get kicked off of our table for 6. ( Yes, kicked off a table- Sheesh!) They were awesome folks though. Two, the woman who took our order was very nice.   The restaurant is built with no rhyme, reason or sense. If it was not crowded enough they crowded even more tables into an already cramped space. They put the coffee counter in the worse strategically placed area in the entire restaurant. I got knocked over twice when I tried to refill my coffee. The restaurant itself is cut throat to get a seat and packed with angry, rude customers and staff who ask you if you are done yet. (Really? When I go out I do not want people rushing me and making me rush off my table. How rude) When we finally got a table we literally got told me could not sit there and had to move because it was reserved for 6 or more people. WHAT??? I have never seen this in a restaurant before. The waitress kept telling us we had to move. Finally, I was so pissed after she told us to go outside in 120 degree heat we went and got people who were waiting and invited them to sit down with us. We made a party table. The waitress was not happy with us. Oh well, the feeling was mutual. The staff find it impossible to work here. They can not deliver the food or service the self serve coffee counter due to space limitations and crowds of people waiting to fight it out for a table. I had the sad misfortune to time my empty coffee cup with the staff members attempt to deliver a new urn of coffee. With that and other customers visiting the counter for napkins and such, it makes it a literally impossible and maddening task. The waitress trying to replace the urn was very rude and snappy with me. She about ripped my head off. Sorry, I am in your way lady. I am a paying customer actually trying to get some of your coffee. They really need to change the entire layout of how they do things here. I can't believe no one has ever gotten hurt or burnt eating at Ncounter. To make matters worse there is a table like two inches away from the counter. God forbid one sits at that table.   So, \"what about the food?\" Hmmmmmm, I found the food not good at all. The coffee was not exceptionally yummy and was way too hot. I got the Banana's Foster and it was Blahhhh. It tasted weird and made me feel sick afterwards. It had some weird sauce on top of it that did not taste right and was strange to the touch. Also, part of our order was not delivered and we had to drive back to get it. My meal was also not hot enough.   On the fair side, my friend had the ham sandwich dish that has a french name to it. I tasted it and it was okay but not good enough for the price. The brownie cookie we had was good too. It wasn't the best I have ever had but good. Their other bakery items looked promising, except maybe the bagel, which looked gross.   The entire experience was so aggravating I would not go back unless it was winter for patio seating, and or off hours, ( But what are their off hours here? This is the second time I have been here and it was too crowded to get service) It seems taking things Togo here might be the way to go. However, then they would need to change the name of the restaurant wouldn't they?",

    "text": "I never enjoy writing poor reviews but I feel strongly about this one. This place has so much potential but fails to meet expectations... consistently.  My coworkers and I used to come to NCounter very often for lunch, it was always packed but quick and the food was always on point. Recently though, it's taken 15-20 minutes to get food (not that long in the scheme of things but pretty long for fast casual). Worse than the wait though, the food has gone downhill. We keep going though, hoping this time will be better than the next, but always leave feeling disappointed.   My old go-to was the Foccaccia Roma-Chicken, which is still probably the best item I've had there, but lately has only had the tiniest piece of chicken. The Cobb sandwich and Pecos Grille seem like safe bets but are less than impressive.  And worst of all, I ordered the tuna melt today and it had almost 0 tuna - all mayo, lettuce, and avocado. I tasted tuna in maybe 2 bites of the whole sandwich. My coworker mentioned she had the same experience and doesn't order that sandwich anymore (in her words, \"Last time I had the tuna sandwich, I was so upset... like I'm almost called to let them know this is unacceptable\" lol... This would have been nice to know before I ordered, right?!)  Because I work in the area, I've only ever had lunch here. It's possible that weekend breakfasts are completely different. And the menu options are great - a lot to choose from and healthy options too. The atmosphere is also a plus - the patio is perfect for nice Tempe days.   I just feel that overall, there are is little attention paid to detail. If some simple adjustments were made - both in the kitchen and with staff - it would make the WORLD of difference.",

From granola wheat germ to fried skillets, eggs benedict, chipotle burro, they have a ton of selections. Yeah, that's the hardest part of going here; selecting what to get. Oh, yeah... Don't forget to start off with a smoothie. If you have kids, ask for the Mickey Mouse pancakes, they will love them.  For lunch, the salads and sandwiches are equally as good. The cheese-freak in me is a fan of the \"melt-down\" and the \"cheddar'd dip\"  Ncounter is one of the most light rail friendly locations along the line. In fact, it's directly across from the light rail station at 3rd and Mill, you can't miss it. If driving, you can park in the garage just West of Ncounter or on Mill OR in the parking lot on the East side of the road.  Oh, they have beer, booze, coffee and pastries, too. Grab a coffee or try a bloody mary or a mimosa while sitting on the patio, you can't go wrong... The red velvet cupcake really doesn't suck. My friend Bill ordered one once and I had to have a taste. Nothing says manly like two dudes sharing a red velvet cupcake, right?",

It's usually pretty quick here anyway, I come all the time on Sundays when it's super crazy, sometimes I can't even find a table to sit at. Today it wasn't that busy at all but yet I waited for my food for an hour and a half!!!!!! When i noticed a few people who had ordered after me got their food already I went up and asked them to check on my order and explained how long we had been waiting and how people who ordered after us had their food they said \"sorry 20 more minutes\". 2 girls sitting next to us that had ordered before us didn't have their food either! Clearly someone messed up our orders. I decided to just get a refund and leave. So did the girls next to us! and of course that took like 15 minutes. 2 hours later I'm starving.

As for the seating: it's OK! You know, it's on Mill Ave (which is so mehhh) so they work with what they were given as far as the building/setup is concerned. It's always so packed BECAUSE the food is so great! If you can find a way to fix the way the seating goes (inside and out) to make it less cramped when it's hopping, you will get a 5 star rating from me. But other than that--kudos! For bringing a nice, divey breakfast joint to a trashy, bar street for ASU and young drunkards alike!",

The smoothie was good and all but that grilled cheese just might be one of the best I've ever had! I did switch the 12-grain bread for sourdough but it was melty, cheesy, crispy, spicy and ooey gooey all at the same time. Very good and will certainly order from here again!",

Nothing really stood out. 4 stars for the environment/vibe/coffee, plus it's my first visit so I've only tried one thing on the menu. I'd definitely like to come back and try more of their menu to see if other options are more flavorful!

    "text": "After my 5k on Saturday 2/13, I went into Ncounter with a friend to enjoy a post-run meal. We snagged a table by the door and after about 10 minutes of eating I watched a homeless man, that was struggling to even walk, slowly make his way to exit the door from using the restroom. Just by looking at him, I could tell he hadn't eaten a good meal in awhile, and sadness just emanated from his eyes. I physically could not sit there and not offer him some of my food, which I would have been throwing out anyways.  I invited him to our table to enjoy some of our leftovers.The manager came by immediately and hovered over our table, while very clearly disrespecting the guest which I had invited to our table. Even going out of his way to criticize the man for apparently \"begging for our food.\" I made a point to ensure him that this was not the case. I then asked him, politely, to retrieve a to-go box and some disposable silverware. He found the smallest box possible, neglected to provide silverware, and basically threw it onto the table without saying a word. The manager of this establishment embarrassed me in front of our guest and I was not going to let that fly. After providing the man with food and finally obtaining silverware, the homeless man went on his way and thanked us profusely.  I then went to the back, near the kitchen, and decided to have a word with the manager in front of his employees. Once again, the manager was disrespectful to me, after I had just spent $30 that morning in his restaurant. He lied to my face - telling me that he is always coming in and begging, which I found hard to believe as he was frightened to even talk to us when I physically had to stop him. I told him that because he had embarrassed me in front of my guest and the entire restaurant, I would now be embarrassing him in front of all of his employees for his atrocious arrogance. I will no longer be stepping foot into this establishment, ever again. The manager is a pity excuse for what it means to run a business, and I feel bad for the employees that have to work under him. It is basic human decency to treat everyone with respect, and I hope this taught him a lesson on humility.  Snooze is a much better alternative, with fantastic staff, and is only about 3 minutes away!",

    "text": "My first visit and I already know I'll be back for more!    Ncounter is on the corner of Mill and 3rd.  Metered street parking is available, but I used the parking garage farther down 3rd- first hour is free.  Large space packed with staggered tables to allow people to walk by, but I found it a little tight, and I'm petite!  There's a partition wall/counter that held the soda fountain and other accoutrements, and beyond that, more two- and four-top tables.  Lots of light shining through from so many glass windows- love it!  Ceiling fans were going full-blast; I couldn't find a table that offered respite from the strong breezes.  Ordering food entails lining up at the counter- not my favorite thing to do, but the process went quickly after I decided what to order.  Staff was very helpful and took time to double-check ingredients info for me.  I ordered the banana walnut pancakes and the Grilled cheese \"Melt Down,\" with ciabatta bread instead of 12-grain (due to allergies).  Also ordered an iced mocha.  The banana walnut pancakes were delicious, and the pancakes had a nice texture! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ncounter-tempe?select=gpDF5uw_20j-D0gth23QLg#gpDF5uw_20j-D0gth23QLg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ncou...</a>  The bananas were a tad too ripe for my taste, but not too mushy I couldn't eat them, so I didn't complain.  I asked what kind of syrup it came with and was told \"artificial syrup,\" and was offered desert honey, which had great flavor and went well with the pancakes.  I liked that the walnuts were plain and not candied.  I will have to try other varieties, as I am not looking forward to eating very soft slices of banana here again.  The grilled cheese sandwich was exquisite! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ncounter-tempe?select=qCkmJETFCMlS7adhlkIR5Q#qCkmJETFCMlS7adhlkIR5Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ncou...</a>  Five kinds of cheeses (jack, cheddar, Swiss, American, and cream), jalapenos, and bacon, with tomatoes omitted.  Ciabatta was toasted and had great textures (crunch/crusty on the outside and soft underneath).  The slices of jalapeno gave this sandwich just enough heat and tang-- I wish I was back at Ncounter having another sandwich just writing about it!  The potato chips were good enough to add crunch, but I could've done without.  Gives me yet another reason to return- to try other sides!  Such great comfort food, I kept two thirds of the sandwich to take home and enjoy later.  Mom tried a small portion and ended up eating most of the leftovers!  That says a lot-- the sandwich kept well AND Mom enjoyed it, and it's hard to impress her with anything, especially with leftovers!!    The iced mocha was just OK.  A little watered down.  Hope I have better luck with other beverages next time, for there will be a next time... Mom has already requested more of the \"Melt Down\" for takeout.  :)",

I am so thrilled that they decided to open two other locations in Phoenix this year because we need more Ncounter in our lives. Don't forget to order through postmates or another food app. It also helps to call in your order for pick up since the line and wait time can be a lot.

I ordered the French Toast with Bananas foster a side of eggs and side of grilled sausage.  My girlfriend ordered the sliced pear omelette and the potatoes along with a Mezcal Mary.  My French toast was great.  Nice crust with a soft cooked middle and the bananas were perfectly ripe.  The eggs were scrambled well and tasted like eggs as opposed to other restaurants where they almost taste like some egg product.   The grilled sausage was cooked perfectly and had a nice snap when you bit into it.   I also had my girlfriends potatoes as she's keto/low carb.  They were well crisped and had a perfect texture.    I am very happy with this visit and would highly recommend anyone give Daily Jam a try.",

I had the killer breakfast sandwich- I thought the Gorgonzola cheese sounded fun but honestly it didn't taste very good and I would not order it again. Potatoes were meh. I enjoyed the bite I tried of the natie bomb lunch sandwich more.  Cool fact about this place is they have cartel coffee, espresso and cold brew. I love cartel cold brew. The brewed passion tea was also delicious.  Mimosa was made with fresh oj and was great size. Screwdriver is also huge and gets two hair-of-the-dog thumbs up.  You order at the front and pick a table. If you want more drinks you have to go back up to the bar get make another purchase.  In summary the 3 stars I devoted to Ncounter are awarded for the beverage game, which was strong. Not my favorite brunch spot.",

In hind sight we clearly should have read up more on this place. We were looking forward to being served a nice brunch. This place, however, is the type you order at the counter. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is not what I want for brunch.  Given the reviews I feared a long line. We lucked out though and the line was quite short. It was still busy so the only open tables were outside. While the seats were mostly shaded it was still far too hot to enjoy it.  I ordered the Hot Juan. Our food came out fairly quickly after that. The Hot Juan is an omelette with chorizo, green pepper, onion, jalapenos, cheese and salsa. The omelette was good sized. There is enough to fill you up without overdoing it. The flavors were solid. The vegetable flavors came through well, but I would have liked more flavor from the chorizo.  The omelette comes with a side of fried potatoes. They were crispy and did the job.  For me this is a good option for a casual breakfast or lunch. It is not a good option for me if I want to sit down and enjoy brunch.",

Ncounter was one of say 20 restaurants honoring a $25 off coupon, so Ncounter had loads of customers at say 8:30 AM on a Saturday. They had adequate cheerful staff and lots of interesting choices, including vegetarian options. They took good care of my 91 year old mother in law, who is blind and showed up in a wheel chair. Veggie omelette was a winner, as were blueberry pancakes, and steel cut oats with berries. Things ran like clockwork. Sorry to say not many places could operate so smoothly with such an influx of customers. Thankfully, everything was prompt, as ordered, and quite tasty. Orange juice tasted fresh squeezed. Cost was say $30 for 3 before tip.",

I ordered chilaquiles which was advertised on the menu to be lightly fried tortillas and offered to add chorizo or chicken for two dollars more, so $11. When I received my food it was two eggs, unfried corn tortillas and a side of spring mix salad which was warmed from sitting in the same container. No chicken in sight. Salad should never ever be served with Mexican eggs and tortilla!!! Very disappointed and the flavor was not good. Will not be ordering from them again.",

    "text": "Ncounter is the hip and happening place to be at lunchtime on Mill Ave.   I had the chance to try this place a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by the vast options on their menu and the quality of food. Everything on the menu looked enticing, but I ended up going with the bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado sandwich with a side salad. I placed my order and took my number to the table to wait for my yummy lunch to arrive. Once it finally did (it did take a while but they were slammed due to popular demand) my tastebuds jumped for joy with the flavors of a regular blt mixed with the egg salad (who would have thought?!?). The mixed green salad was nothing special, but it didn't need to be. Next time I won't be so healthy and I'll go with chips or something fried! Other menu items I'll be back to try will be their breakfasts...oh my goodness they sounded good.   The environment at Ncounter is very busy, but it isn't overwhelming. Despite it being crowded they have a good system so that the ordering line goes quickly, there are clean tables and seats available for everyone, and the process is comfortable for all who walk in the door. The staff is very friendly and all seemed to be working hard to make everything run like clockwork.   Ncounter is a top notch lunch or breakfast spot for anyone who wants a solid meal (with both inside he box and outside the box flavors) at a reasonable price. If you are hungry on Mill Ave give them a whirl!",

    "text": "I really like that Mill has another option for the working crowd nearby. With our office down the street, I was growing pretty tired of the uber college pub-deli-pizza routine, in fact I drive away from this areas most days. But NCounter is a nice addition: cool space and a much needed revival on this corner. The remodel was done beautifully and the place gets so much more traffic now than it ever did with a crepe and coffee shop. Kudos to opening something comfortable enough to sit down in but quick enough for take out.  The food has been decent in my experience. Having ordered several meatless entrees from both the breakfast and lunch menus, my consensus is that the quality and creativity is pretty much what I'd expect from any Mill Ave establishment. Not knock-your-socks-off, but much better than drive thru. The presence of some healthy options is appealing. The egg white omelette was ok, but relatively flavorless even with tomato, peppers (still raw), avocado and cilantro. I usually get the Portobello sandwhich veganized with no cheese or mayo, but they've messed up my order a few times for take out, meaning I don't realize the cheese is on there until I've walked back to the office. I do wish the counter staff would pay a little more attention when customers order, but they aren't rude.  Can't say I'm a regular, but it's good to have a decent nearby option that's not burgers and fries. I do love scheduling \"meetings\" here just to get out of the office.",

The sandwich and side salad were beyond my expectations for this place (which was hard to do since I already had high hopes).   The place was a little corky and unique.  It was pretty busy so we had to sit outside.  Living in AZ, most know this can kill an experience.  NCounter had fans and misters outside so it was actually really nice.  The only downside is it took a little long for the food considering it was all pretty much sandwiches we ordered, but it was worth the wait.  I would recommend this place in a HEART BEAT!  Keep in mind when going, it is only open until 3:00 pm.",

    "text": "A word of advice to those eating in the Tempe area: avoid restaurants filled with trendy vibes, trendy college students, and 40-somethings dressing 20-something to relive their trendy years. Do I sound petty? Perhaps. But I stand by that statement and Ncounter is probably the best proof I can display to fulfill my words.  Aesthetically, Ncounter appears to be your standard wannabee \"coffee center of intellect.\" Sepia toned pictures of windmills straight out of the Wizard of Oz, run-of-the-mill bright wood tables, a \"bar,\" and a hand full of the self-proclaimed elite trend monkeys I just love so much to hate. What a bore.   Now being my first, and hopefully last, visit to Ncounter both myself and the person I came with were slightly taken back by the new menu. Standing a few feet away from the actual ordering area we spent at least five or so minutes pondering upon what to eat. Everything sounded so appealing and utterly delicious! Every breakfast classic from eggs benedict (shortened to \"bene's\" ugh...) to your standard omelette had enough variations available to please nearly any palette. Already in the mood for an omelette, I gravitated towards an item entitled the \"Hot Juan.\" Chorizo, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, peppers, and onions; sounds wonderful does it not? My breakfast mate decided upon a somewhat similar option, \"Huevos n' Chorizo.\" Essentially the same dish only the eggs are served sunny side rather than in omelette form. We also ordered a side of sourdough toast and a coffee to share. **The coffee here is self serve, something I have not before seen in a restaurant. A great idea I wish more establishments would catch on to.**  Before I get into the actual food itself I want to discuss the vibe and service of Ncounter. The place is infested with what could possibly be the rudest, most self-absorbed, trendy, soul wretched, basic, and nasty clientele and staff on Earth. Everyone from the man behind the ordering counter to the bus boys to the gathering of Pitchfork Media fans (some of them were actually wearing the logo on their clothes...) exuded a vile aura of judgement. Sneering and sneakily nodding at the apparently entertaining crowd around them, each and every individual resembled a cartoon character created to fill the world with angst and elitism. I could not help but feel like an onlooker of a real life Breakfast Club. Clashing cliques of staff and customers. Is this a restaurant or high school? Also really did not appreciate my server essentially tossing my plate of food on the table and scurrying away without a word.   Okay so you get the point, the place is hipster hell. Or maybe I'm just being dramatic. I imagine everyone will have different opinion on the matter. Fortunately, I actually do have something both undeniable AND negative to spew about Ncounter. The food resembled that of a musty and fly ridden diner I once ate at in a nightmare I had years ago. In fact, it was so insultingly putrid and revolting I refuse to actually go in depth. So instead here is a short list of single words that describe the slop I was served: 1. Cold 2. Meatless 3. Pace (yes, like the salsa brand) 4. Floppy 5. Speechless   Ncounter serves no purpose for a foodie, which is weird because I seem to have developed a love-hate relationship with the dump over the course of writing this review. I absolutely LOVE and ADORE the fact that Ncounter is essentially the restaurant equivalent to an Old-Western brothel. The over-hyped food and foul attitude of the place keeps trendy people out of my sight much like cheap whiskey and prostitutes herded the mongrel masses of times past into a playpen of their own filthy ways. I absolutely HATE everything else about it.   In case you didn't pick this up on your own, the ever increasing anger in the tone of my review really just represents EXACTLY how my experience played out... Also I feel ashamed I actually devoted so much emotion and time into writing about Ncounter. God, even the name is terrible isn't?",

    "text": "Easily one of my favorite breakfast places in Tempe! It comes across as high-end, but casual at the same time. Whether you're a sweets for breakfast person, or are more a fan of the savory omelet, eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy side of the aisle, Ncounter does it all very well. They also offer a variety of well-done breakfast cocktails like mimosa, greyhounds, and bloody marys. So far I have not been disappointed by anything I've tried here.  The omelets I've had here have been incredibly fresh, all the ingredients certainly chopped/cooked on the spot. They have so many options when it comes to additions that I'm certain anyone can find something they'll like. Ncounter can get pretty creative, I personally appreciate the Greek and pear omelets, as well as the variety of eggs benedict combinations.  I've also tried the french toast and it was very fluffy, perfectly fried. Also, the french toast was huge portion-wise. I'm not sure how they do it, if they just have giant loaves of homemade bread or what but it works.  Ncounter is upscale on the inside, but carries a laid-back vibe. You order at the counter, are given a number, and its up to you to find a table to have your food delivered to. This can be one of the only downsides (though a good problem for them to have) is that finding a table on a weekend can be pretty challenging. They do have misters on the patio but in the heat of summer they only help so much.   Overall, Ncounter is great place for breakfast/brunch on the weekend, especially with their extensive cocktail selection if you're into that. For what you get, it's not much more expensive than any other decent breakfast place in town however I don't see it being the best place for families/kids. Breakfast is going to run you $10 per person, $15ish if you get a mimosa or something like that but I can sincerely say the quality is well worth it, you won't be disappointed. Get there early enough to hunt down a decent table and you're golden. I wouldn't recommend the patio after 10/11 in the summer.",

It's almost as if being nice was a strain on their well being. Also management should probably tell them to smile more cause frowning at your guests makes them feel unwelcome. They also should explain that greeting and helping people when they approach the counter would be helpful so I know this place actually wants my business. If not that's okay there's plenty other breakfast places like first watch and snooze who can overcharge for breakfast but at least give amazing customer service. Hope this helps. Also whoever brews their coffee should take a lesson in how much water to actually add. If I'm paying $3 for a coffee it should be enjoyable not taste like dirty water. Hope this helps management to fix the problems and hope this helps other people make a good decision when getting breakfast. The blonde lady who works at the front counter really needs a review on customer service. If she's too good to help anybody then she doesn't really need the job, does she?",

I got the eggs Benedict (hard to make perfect but it was good) $8.5 my daughter had the pancakes with blueberries and REAL CREAM. Best pancakes and value. $6.5 Hubby had waffles with strawberries and real cream $6.5 Then we tried the hulk smoothie. The smoothie was mostly just ice so wasn't impressed by that 5$ So fair prices for a nice breakfast experience.",

The garnish on the bloody was a lime, no celery, olive or asparagus ! There is a frozen rose for $9. as well. Really? The cheap drinks were the reason we were willing to put up with the counter ordering system, which is dumb because there are 10 servers milling around, why not just take orders? It's not formal enough to take out of town guests, but not cheap either. We enjoyed the food last time, but didn't stay this time because of the hefty drink prices in plastic cups. The bar and service staff was very friendly and inviting, so if you don't want to get your drink on, go here!!!!",

I came there at 11:30 A.M. on a Sunday (so certainly in the middle of the brunch rush). Despite that, I received service that was superior, genuine and speedy. More importantly, the food that I ordered (morning glory omelette with a side of fruit) was delectable (I don't get omelettes too often because they tend to be bland, but this is easily the best omelette that I have had), generously seasoned and loaded with fresh avocado, tomato and onion. In addition, the fruit was certainly more than just an afterthought with a thoughtful mix of grapes, melons and pineapple (and no cheap fillers either). While it may be difficult to make a brunch decision with all of the available options, Ncounter has plenty of options for anyone that is guaranteed to be very enjoyable",

The red velvet waffles were delicious and not too sweet. The BYO sandwich and the side of potatoes were so bomb that we ended up ordering another side of potatoes.

But going to the hoity toity French cafe vibe really doesn't fit for them as they have not trotted out the same customer service.  But here's the thing with that cafe style culture...there is no coffee menu on the wall, there is here.  But when you go to a cafe like that they can churn out amazing cappucinos and lattes with one barista.   The food was decent.  I do like the croque madame, but overall it was just ok when you combine the speed at which they took orders (slow).",

I really like how they were able to cook the egg Benedict so well. I just wish I had asked for it to be cooked over-medium. The middle of the eggs were runny just as they should be. The hollandaise sauce was good too. The potato bits left a little to be desired. They seemed to be hollow on the inside. I prefer my potatoes bits to be slightly crispy on the outside with a fluffy, mealy interior.   When I arrived, the restaurant was busy. As I sat there, the restaurant became packed. I'm glad they were able to get my food out without me having to wait too long.   They had an area for condiments and drinks on the side. I was surprised by how many condiments they offered. Overall, the classic egg Benedict was tasty, but the potato bits left something to be desired.",

When the server came by, the dad mentioned that the food wasn't sitting well with his daughter's stomach. The server kindly offered to bring her something else and said she would stop by when the daughter was out of the restroom to get her order. Later, the manager stopped by...the manager was completely hostile towards the family. She questioned why the daughter \"ate all of the food\" and wanted more food and why she wanted to eat more if her stomach hurts. It was completely inappropriate and rude to the teen and her dad. They ultimately said never mind and that they would leave. Also, the girl hasn't eaten much of the dish and the server offered to bring a new dish! It was a loud confrontation that left us, one table over, feeling uncomfortable.   Also the food was blah, very mediocre. Chai tea was good. Skip this place. There are bunch of better places for brunch!",

Next time avoid summer time and go earlier or later when its less crowded.",

I had the Farmer's Market Benedict and absolutely loved the hollandaise sauce and the potatoes on the side were really good - perfectly crispy on the outside.

    "text": "I stopped in for coffee after hiking \"A\" Mountain and was excited when I saw they served PRESSED coffee which is one of my local favorites. It was kinda busy but expected on a Sunday morning. The line was long but I was able to order coffee from the bar.  The coffee was expensive like $4 for an 8oz cup but I love Pressed coffee so didn't mind. I ordered my drink and was surprised when I was handed a cup to go get coffee from the self serve dispenser. I should have known something was wrong then smh   I proceeded to get my coffee which I desperately needed due to my morning hike and of course it was EMPTY! I went to notify a staff members when I very rudely brushed off and told someone should be handling it.  At this point I was to ask for my WHOLE $3.94 back lol. My friend had ordered a smoothie and was waiting so I decided to just be patient. A couple of minutes later someone came out with coffee.  As soon as I tasted the coffee I knew it WAS NOT Pressed coffee. It was disgusting....tasted like dish liquid.  At that point I decided that I would just walk to Starbucks once she got her smoothie.   We found a table as we waited and 10 minutes later she still hadn't got her smoothie.  After checking with the cashier she was told for the 1st time that smoothies were picked up from the bar.  Her smoothie was sitting there, melted:-(  This was my first and LAST TIME COMING coming to encounter!!  UPDATE!!!  I recently went back to NCounter and am happy to say my experience was 100% better this time around. My husband and I stopped in for lunch to a long line.  It was moving pretty fast so we didn't wait long...just long enough to browse the menu.  We opted for a Strawberry Banana Smoothie and the Pecos sandwich w/ a side of pasta salad.    I kid u not...the cashier was handing me my change when I heard our name called from the coffee bar. My smoothie was ready in less than 1 minute.  I've had many SB smoothies in my day and I must say this one wasn't bad. They use orange juice as the base (I prefer Almond Milk) but it was pretty tasty, a little tart from the OJ.   The Pecos Sandwich was perfect! Buttery toasted bread, thick slices of turkey and fresh veggies. We had great seats on the patio and relaxed while eating our lunch.    NCounter has won back my business....I'm a happy customer!",

Double doors were wide open, beautiful day. Walk up to cashier to place the order. Was met by two very friendly and smiling young ladies. Ordered a spicy omelette. You sit down and they bring it to you. It was huge! More importantly, it was delicious. Great breakfast place.",

Although the restaurant was packed, we were able to find a table but the table was dirty with crumbs. The restaurant is very loud and is not a place for large groups or if you want to have a conversation. The Daily Jam has a large menu and drinks; and the ordering line moves quickly. On Sundays street parking is free, otherwise, I recommend parking in one of the garages. There are so many other great restaurants on Mill, I would advise going elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'll admit it, I have never had egg salad but I am so quick to tell you that I don't like it. While my girls were running the Wonder Woman 5k on a Sunday morning, my partner and I decided we needed some breakfast so walked down to Daily Jam. The restaurant was a little crowded but you walk past the bar and up the counter to order instead of having to wait for a table.   The line was short and we placed out orders quickly. I really wanted a BLT, but it has egg salad on it. I decided to give it a shot. We ordered 2 ultimate BLTs (I think that is the name), a side of potatoes and a drink- to go.  Service was quick, we got our food in less than 10 minutes. I don't recall seeing that the sandwiches come with potato chips on the menu but it's possible it was there and I just missed it. Just in case it's not there, take note. You don't need an additional side. Anywho, the only downfall was that the pick up spot for to go food is on the opposite side of the registers. Since we got a drink, we exited the line like normal but then had to walk back through the sea of people that had now formed in order to wait for our food. The waiting spot is pretty tight. Luckily there is a door to exit onto the patio because at that point, you aren't walking back through the restaurant to go out the front.  We walked out food back to Tempe Beach Park and set up to wait for the girls to finish the run. A couple people stopped by our table and asked us where we got our food because it smelled really good...and it was. Turns out I like egg salad.",

You have a choice of toppings like fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips. I had chocolate chips for my toppings. I was very satisfied with my choice, the chocolate chips was melting on top of the waffle and it was just a nice creamy texture. It was a nice compliment to the Red Velvet Waffle. I didn't even use the syrup because the chocolate chips was enough sweetness for me. I really enjoyed my breakfast choice this morning.",

But again we only ordered sandwiches and that's not their specialty. Apparently eggs are. I asked for no mayo. I got mayo. Again, no mayo. (One of the mangers already wrote me and said they would have corrected it), but we were in a hurry, and I like my food correct the first time. Pretty much ruined the sandwich for me. So I scraped the bread, and ate the parts that were mayo free. The lettuce was quality, none of the iceberg stuff, and my partner said her tuna had cranberries and other good bits in it. I like that. Next time we'll try the eggs.",

We found a window seat and perused the menu prior to going to the counter to place our order. The menu had great choices which included both staples and creative variations. I ordered a coffee and a Mescal Mary and my boyfriend ordered a soda. For breakfast, he got the Bananas Foster French toast and a few sides. I ordered the Pear Omelet.   The coffee station was self serve and delicious. The Mary came out quickly. Pretty spicy, but garnished with a piece of bacon.   They deliver the food to your table and when it came out, our eyes had a pre-game feast before our bellies. Everything looked AMAZING. Once we tasted it, our palettes confirmed the deliciousness.   My boyfriend was delighted with his French toast and sides and my omelet was a perfect balance of sweet and savory. Every element was independently delicious and perfectly cooked and married well on the plate.   We will definitely go back again before we make the journey home!",

I got the Chop Salad and it was awesome.  It had the normal salad stuff, but also included couscous, corn, cranberries, and feta cheese.  To top it off it came with a pesto dressing that was superb.  I work on Mill and appreciate a place to eat that's consistently good and has staying power.  NCounter is my new favorite!  I highly recommend it, everything I've tried has been delicious.  If the rating was just based on food alone I would have given them 5 stars.  For me, the atmosphere makes it a 4 star rating.  It's very eclectic and modern inside and perfect for this type of restaurant, however I prefer a little less noise so it's easier to talk to my lunch companions.  Thank you to the management of NCounter for restoring my faith in their customer service.",

Their menu is amazing - it was so difficult for me to decide what I wanted, and I'm usually not indecisive when it comes to food decisions. The line was HUGE when we walked in the door - we almost decided to go somewhere else because we figured it would take forever. Wrong! We were probably in line for around 5 minutes; it was moving very quickly. After we ordered, our food came out very fast too. I was impressed. They obviously have their 'flow' down pat and were properly staffed for such a busy morning.   I had the eggs n' chorizo, it was fantastic. The pear omelette caught my eye and I will definitely be trying it next time. A breakfast place that's in a decent price range that serves mimosas, bellinis, and bloody mary's? Count me IN! I will definitely be indulging the next time I stumble in after a rough night.   Nothing much to say about the service. The girl at the counter was quick and efficient and our food came quickly too. You serve your own drinks and any accoutrements you might need (napkins, silverware, hot sauce, ketchup, sugar, etc) are on the counter next to the soda station for you to take at your convenience.   Bottom line for me....the food was amazing, lots of awesome choices and innovative ingredient pairings, and the price was definitely right - I'll be back!",

    "text": "While I love having a fancy dish at Essence, it's nice to finally have an option for an all-American style breakfast in Tempe that isn't IHOP.  Though often crowded on the weekends, the servers really do a great job of clearing off tables quickly, and checking in to make sure all is well with your dishes. I have been there over 10 times, and have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table to open up.  I think the only confusing aspect of the restaurant is how your food is ordered. A few times I have been waiting in line to order at the main registers, when servers at the secondary registers (next to the drink bar) have asked people behind me for their orders. It just feels weird to be standing ahead of someone in line, only to hear them get their order in before you. A couple times, it left me feeling as though NCounter wasn't well organized and a bit put off that my food wait time was increased even though I was ahead in line. That's the reason I have knocked off one star from my rating.  I just learned, though, that you can also order food online. My husband went to pickup an online order and showed up 5-6 minutes early to just be safe and the food was already packed up and waiting. I did wonder how long it had been sitting there before being picked up. Perhaps NCounter would do better if these online orders were 2 minutes late instead of 10 minutes early. Just a suggestion.  The food, though, is fantastic! My favorite items to order include:  * Eggs, Toast, and Grilled Potatoes ($5.50)--simple and tasty, make sure to ask for some extra jam! * Classic Eggs Benedict ($8)--Delicious! * French Toast ($5.50) * The Pear Omelette ($8)--you can't beat this brie and bacon combination.",

I've been three times this week, and I've noticed a few minor missteps, but it's their first week and they're off and running.  Loved the bananas foster french toast (though the bananas were a little cool, as was the bacon that came with), not sure if they use real maple syrup, since it was coated in awesome... wouldn't mind clarification on that.  A bit annoyed that they only have Minute Maid lemonade, and a few other things seem to be more quick-and-dirty versions than home-grown versions (the potatoes for instance, which are tasty, but don't strike me as homemade like Liberty Market's or Matt's Big Breakfast.)  Fantastic toast and jam, and good eggs. I tried their chicken sandwich on Foccacia today and it was delightful. Good portion, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The atmosphere is fun, the cupcakes are dangerously dense and delicious, the seating is flexible, and the service was incredibly friendly and darn fast.   I wish a few things were a bit higher quality, but that's because I've been spoiled to death by Matt's & Liberty's take-no-prisoners approach. NCounter is a great fit, they've done great things with the space, and seriously: three times this week, the office has trekked on down there.",

And it has plenty of seating, which is always good.   I ordered the Farmer's Market eggs, which are a take on Eggs Benedict, and freshly squeezed OJ. The only hiccup with service was that I didn't realize that they don't bring the OJ out to you w/ the rest of the food and they didn't explain that you actually grab it from a little fridge cart near the counter - but that wasn't a huge deal.  The food came out fairly quickly and my dish was super yummy. Eggs perfectly cooked, a nice hollandaise sauce, decent potatoes... and I love anything w/ spinach and avocado. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was \"this close\" to licking my plate clean.   My co-worker ordered one of their sandwiches and said it was good, and specifically commented how good the bacon was.   I can't wait to go back and try some of their pastries and coffee.",

The food came out quickly, and when the tea and coffee dispensers were out, when we told a server they replaced it right away.  Although the food was delicious, the only thing I didn't like about it was the way you went and ordered first and then found a seat.  It's kind of like an in between of fast food and sit down restaurant, which is fine, but because the place is so small I had to hunt for a table.  I eventually went and swooped in on a table while my boyfriend waited in line to order because we were worried there wouldn't be any tables left by the time our food came.  Other than that, everything was perfect.  I will definitely be back, but probably on a day when they are not quite so busy",

That being said, we were there today for breakfast and the food was very good. I had the farmer's market bene and it was really tasty, although just a little tiny bit less than hot. Still good and the potatoes are amazing. Hubby had the crack o' dawn sautee dish. He said it was really good and the jelly on the toast was super tasty. My biggest beef is with the bartender/barista who lost my order for a latte while chatting it up with some girls at the counter and we had to go ask for it and then it came after my food and was also less than hot. Otherwise, I'd totally go back again as the stuff other people were eating also looked really good, including the pancakes which I have to try next. I'm hoping the orders will be timed out a little better next time.",

Good for them, but it really kills the vibe whilst screaming over brunch/lunch. The cashier/order window is in the left- back, so fight your way passed the packed tables and stand in line to order. They are pretty good about getting the food out quickly and the food...well it's decent. Their sandwiches are very good, the breakfast burrito - ehh, I've had much better.   Overall, nice spot to check out for breakfast/brunch that isn't as pricey as Harlows, with a chic, modern atmosphere. But if it's crowded and you value relaxing conversation, look elsewhere.",

They seem to have a ton of staff behind the main counter but depending on the time of day (or some other inscrutable factor?) they want customers to order everything at the coffee bar counter, not the main counter. They don't make it very clear and I've witnessed a lot of confusion over where to order by other customers. Despite so many \"cooks\" in the kitchen, simple orders take a long time coming out, even to go orders. On my last visit I ordered a full breakfast, the salad it came with was wilty (didn't realize til I was gone and it was too late) and the eggs smelled so horrible I was actually looking around the elevator I was in to see who else was causing the stink. When I got to my desk I realized my breakfast was the culprit behind the reek. Not awesome. Also, staff seem aloof, like maybe they think they are too cool for their customers.  This place is right next to my office and I wanted to like them. But I won't be wasting any more time or money here in the future.",

My girlfriend and I waited almost 30 minutes for a take out order. We quietly stood by the pickup counter patiently waiting and there were three associates that would periodically look over at us but didn't even bother to ask what we were waiting on. After 30 minutes go by I finally ask if our order is done and its over on the other side of the counter just waiting to be bagged up. Working in the kitchen I know it doesn't take thirty minutes to make eggs and the associates should have been courteous and asked what we had been waiting on. They bagged our food and handed it over to us with no sorry  or apologies . I am never coming back to this restaurant unfortunately and I will be sure to tell my friends. I hope that the manager reflects on this from a customer perspective.",

The first time I ordered the pear omelet, which I remember scarfing down in a state of sweet, cheesy, eggy bliss. I also had a greyhound - fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and vodka - which really made my day for two reason: first, it combines three of my favorite things (grapefruit, vodka, greyhounds), and also because the juice is fresh.   My second time there I got the Farmer's Market, which is there vegetarian version of eggs Benedict: English muffin, tomato, spinach, avocado, poached egg, hollandaise. Yum. Most of the dishes are paired with potatoes, and I am happy to report that these are also excellent. Many of the breakfast potatoes around are mediocre at best, but there are nicely seasoned and cooked just right. I paired my meal with a cappuccino, the only disappointing part of my experience. If you want a cappuccino made the traditional way, with equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam, then order it dry. Otherwise you will be served a latte. Send it back and you will be served another latte. Say something to the barista and you will be informed that you are wrong. Ah well, this really isn't such a big deal since there is a clear way around it.   NCounter will likely be making it into the regular rotation of breakfast places, especially on days when a breakfast cocktail is in order.",

Service is fast because you don't have to wait for a server to bring you menus and take your order, you go right up to the counter and order off the menu they have displayed then they bring your food to your table once it's done.  A definite plus is that they do have a bar as well so if you want to order a Screwdriver with your breakfast, more power to you.  I definitely did!  Food itself is DELICIOUS!  I ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast and I was practically licking my plate at the end of it.  The flavors blended together perfectly and the portion size was good too.

It seemed as though the cared, and enjoyed their jobs. Well done.   I had the Farmers Market, essentially a vegetarian eggs Benny. Quite tasty and good portions. The only negative with my meal was that one of my eggs was poached hard, the other very runny. Not sure how this happens, but no big deal. Variety is the spice of life, they say, and ncounter is no exception it seems.  A bit of Cholula hot sauce and I was good to go.   Street parking was plentiful.

The patio is a great size and was all shaded so it wasn't very hot. One of the workers even brought out a dog bowl of water for my dog which was really sweet.   We chatted over bloody mary's, mimosas, and bellinis for a couple of hours. I wasn't hungry at the time so I didn't' try any of the food, but my friend is somewhat obsessed with this place and says their food is amazing!

Melons add zero flavor or texture to a parfait and frankly, its cheap. Ok, I'm being mean and I'm kind of sorry. But I'm kind of not.   A killer parfait has rolled oats, honey, and some actual fresh berries like: Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Goji Berries, pomegranate seeds, etc... Something besides melon. I think you're picking up what I'm putting down.",

Took about fifteen minutes for our food to arrive. Also, we appreciated that the menu indicated gluten-free items!  Boyfriend was very pleased with his omelet and sides. The granola pancake was basically just granola thrown on to their regular pancake batter. It was good, but I was disappointed to find that one of my pancakes was raw on the inside (next to the granola). We will return, but I am going to get a different dish next time.",

That's cool. The service was prompt and friendly. Lots of goodies in the display case. Yay! Things are looking up.  The Blackberry Jasmine Green Tea was crisp and fresh. Only sat for a few minutes when my food was delivered and boy, did it look good!  Unfortunately, that's where the good part ends...  It may have been the prettiest Tuna Melt I've eaten in a long time but it was also one of the worst. I used five napkins--FIVE!--to sop up all the dripping mayonnaise from this tuna salad that was spewing all over my plate/side salad/table/lap. Yuck. When are restaurants going to learn that you only put enough mayo in tuna salad to hold the ingredients together??? I'm sorry, but if you hold up a tuna sandwich and it all drips out, you've done something wrong. Such a shame because it really did look pretty on the plate...   I was even more disappointed to find that they drenched the side salad in WAY too much balsamic dressing, so I abandoned that completely.  And the final nail in the coffin was the \"Ncounter\" signature dessert which is a combination brownie/oreo/chocolate-chip cookie. It was $4 and I only took one bite. SO DRY! Ugh.  I had wanted to try them again for breakfast sometime but I really doubt that I will.",

The food is perfect (eggs etc, sandwiches, salads) and quick (order at the counter and they deliver to your table). The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Everything on the menu is delicious...I've tried it all.  It's right across from the light rail stop at 3rd & Mill.  There's also convenient parking half a block west in the garage.  So here are a few problems to keep in mind before you go (you should go, but beware):  1). The drip coffee sucks. If you want a good coffee drink ask for it at the coffee counter....or walk a block south to Starbucks.    2). There is only one electrical outlet for public use in the whole place. So charge your devices before you go. No, I won't tell you where it is but if you see me there I might share it with you.  3). During the ASU school year it is usually busy. But don't let the lines keep you away. They move surprisingly fast and you will be eating sooner than if you were to go elsewhere.",

I also love that they have a protein smoothie on their menu so I enjoy my brunch with my man friend instead of getting stuck at some health food place.  With all this good food the place can get busy and slow which is the only negative thing I can say about it but I guess that is what happens when people find out that your food is freaking amazing.

I now ALWAYS get the Croque Monsieur. Sourdough bread topped with ham, tomatoes, gruyere, mustard, and two basted eggs. Every time I go back I tell myself to try something new like Bananas Fosters French (which looks so yummy!), but I a,ways go back to this.   But, as I mentioned, it is quite pricey for something next to a college campus. The mimosas were over $5 and, while tasty, we're small and not a good value. I also believe the food prices may have raised since their opening. Maybe this is because of their quick rise in popularity.",

    "text": "Oh Ncounter.  I was so excited. Why oh why was my food so cold and flavorless.  I live within biking distance to Mill, so I was thrilled to see a new cool spot was opening up.  I was picturing cruising to Ncounter to grab a coffee and an omelet and going about my merry way. Sadly, this fantasy will not come to fruition.  Understandably, the place has only been open a week.  I know how hard it can be to work out the opening kinks, I've been in service for going on a hundred years now, so if I happen to go back, I'll be happy to reevaluate.  But honestly, this isn't the first restaurant you've opened...so why the subpar food???  I can only speak about the food I tried, so here it goes: I ordered a latte and the Greek omelet.  I was pleasantly surprised by the latte.  I get soy milk, and often places somehow manage to make it taste like wood pulp, but here they got it right! Hooray, they passed the first test!  On to the omelet.  Yuck.  I don't know what the story was with this thing.  First off, cold. Secondly, raw white onions are just not my cup of tea.  I expected them to be sauteed and possibly seasoned.  But no.  Just raw, cold white onions.  Add cold artichokes, tomatoes, and a mere hint of feta cheese, and there you have the greek omelet.  I would have hoped for some sort of seasoning...I don't even think there was salt and pepper. :( My boyfriend got the Ncounter omelet and an americano.  Unfortunately, his were both strikes.  The americano barely tasted like espresso.  I'm not quite sure if their barista knows what they're doing.  And his omelet? wow...the presentation itself was...well...gross.  Take a look at the accompanying pics...I think cottage cheese and hollandaise sauce should be put in cups...otherwise it looks like a big, multi-colored splat.  No, the taste wasn't there either.  The hollandaise was lackluster, and that was really all that you could taste.  Damn.  I love hollandaise, I was hoping for a really indulgent, amazing, gluttony inducing, goop.  But no again.  The service was pretty good.  You could tell the cashier's were sick of the same questions, but I know how that goes.  At least they were smiling through their frustration.  I'd like to end this review by saying this: throughout writing this, I have decided to go back in a month or so.  I hope all the kinks are worked out, the cooks find their groove, and the barista gets the hang of it all.  I really would like my fantasy of a weekend brunch on the patio after a little bike ride to come True............    A five star review is in the works...I just feel it!!!",

Sadly, I could taste the few last chunks of spinach, I presume, that would have been nicely blended if she just let it finish....(I should note that I've never dined in.)",

Tables were close together and could be easily pushed together in the event you have an encounter (get it!) with a stranger and want to become better acquainted. The restaurant was well staffed with friendly people striking up conversations and answering questions.  Plus the food was terrific. (It reminded me a lot of Local Breeze: fresh, local, healthy.) The coffee is local and comes from Press Coffee. Delicious and it comes with free refills. They also had a large assortment of baked goods and I'm pretty sure I saw someone with a mimosa. I welcome NCounter to Mill Ave and wish them nothing but the best.",

NCounter could be a \"Morning Club\" where you get coffee and orange juice, after your night of martini's and dancing at the night club.  There is definitely an energetic vibe here, (maybe not everyone likes that in the morning.....so, be forewarned) there is loud music, tons of people and good food. It's a walk up to the counter sort of place, you might want to stare at the menu overhead before getting in line and delaying everyone behind you as you try to make up your mind (sorry everyone! I'm one of those indecisive persons that annoy everyone.....) I ordered an omelette (finally) which was pretty good. I'm looking forward to trying more of their dishes (including some of their healthier options, like the egg-white omelette).   Anyways, this really is a fun breakfast stop (especially if you don't feel like going to those truck-driver diner type places and are looking for something hip and fresh...[and eye-opening!])",

Felt like a Denny's with a trendy name and a few additional \"healthy\" options.   I ordered the Ncounter omelette. The chicken wasn't seasoned, and added a bland flavor to the dish. I figured their signature omelette would be tasty, but no.  French toast was okay, but syrup was of poor quality. For the price we expected much more.  To top it off, they lost our friends order, so after 30 minutes we approached the counter about it and 12 minutes later it was served.... but by that time we were ready to go. Will never be back, it's nothing special. :/ boo, wanted a fun brunch.",

I like almost all breakfast places, but was not all that impressed with Ncounter. I feel like I really could have liked it if I had ordered something else though!  It was pretty busy there, so that seemed like a good sign. We also got our food fast which was good. I got a Mimosa and the Farmer's Choice Eggs Benedict. Being the clumsy individual I am, I spilled 1/4 of my mimosa within seconds of getting it. Napkins were MIA for some reason. Then I finally found them in an unexpected place. Then could not find a trash can anywhere. That fiasco aside, the food was kind of gross. Usually I pretty much inhale all my food within minutes, but it was not that way with my eggs benedict and I was sad! It was just very soggy. So much hollandaise sauce that it masked the flavor of everything else on the english muffin.  I would be open to giving it a second try, but I was not too happy with my first experience here.",

I ordered for my husband and I at one register, my friend at the other, so our orders could not be put on the same table marker, even though we ordered at the same time. My friend's order of an omelette came out fairly promptly, nice and hot.  Ten minutes later our order, of pancakes and a market bennie came out stone cold. No servers asked us how things were, so rather than try and get someone to care, we just ate. My husband's blueberry pancakes had approximately 15 berries in the cakes, and a bare dozen on top. The coffee was hot, but only one of the two urns had any, and there was only one dispenser of 2% milk which ran out, so you had to visit both sides of the coffee counter to get your coffee put together.  Given that it was less crowded than normal, we were disappointed in our rather expensive ($30 for pancakes, three eggs, market Bennie and two coffees) meal. Better prices and service can be had elsewhere.",

Yum!  Order like a fast food joint and seated like a restaurant.  Not sure how I like that.  Sitting at the bar is not a bad idea either to get away from the crowd...or into it I should say.  The layout of the restaurant is a tad bit odd.  When it's busy with lines you kind of line up back to back with patrons at the bar and people sitting around!  Guess you must love thy neighbor here -- wink!  I ordered the Chipotle Egg Burrito.  Presentation is a plus here!  First thought to me was there was a lot of cheese!  I'm not a cheese fan, but if you are this is your type of burrito.  With bacon, avocado, potatoes, cilantro, eggs, and a chipotle sauce it seems overwhelming, but it works.  However, I'm a texture guy and everything seems to be a one big mush for me.  If they added some crunch I think this burrito would be out of this world (tortilla chips?)    In the end, the place is packing with students and hipsters.  Very crowded and loud if you don't mind it's pretty cool.  Outdoor seating is nice and the food is A-Okay in my book! - Enjoy!",

The biscuit was okay but the gravy was Bland and the sausage tasted like Frozen sausage crumbles. There was also a bone in my gravy. The coffee was just okay the only thing that was actually good was the bacon. The cashier was friendly but the rest of the staff seem pretty indifferent. I could have spent $6 at Denny's for the same quality of food that I paid $12 at Ncounter. Since I haven't tried anything else here I don't want to give a negative recommendation but I wouldn't spend money in this place again.",

There were a TON of people swarming the place so the atmosphere was really frenetic and all the servers seemed annoyed and frazzled. I realize why they want you to order at the front--because if they served you like a regular place, they'd have to take off the cost of things on your bill because they messed up. So, yeah, you order at the counter and wait. And wait. And wait. We saw multiple tables get their food before us. We waited literally a half hour. We asked what was up and they said our order was lost somehow. Eyeroll. Thankfully, they got it out quickly after that, without utensils. I went to get some and found the utensil holder empty. The waitress said the forks were coming. Some kind of dishwasher delay. Uh, what kind of restaurant doesn't have forks? So then my food got cold. Worst of all, because I was so starving by the time I got to eat, the serving size didn't do it for me. It's not generous at all. It's like those gourmet places with tiny portions. I left hungry.",

Seemed as though they were more focused about moving people in and out.  Although the staff didn't start me off right, the food was extremely good.  I had the breakfast burrito.  It came out with a spinach salad that had a really good dressing - a unique add on to a breakfasts burrito.  The burrito was phenomenal.  Eggs were perfectly cooked and the entree didn't require any sprucing up with hot sauce or salt etc.  My wife and mom had the farmers Benadict.  The plate was exceptional with extremely fresh and flavorful ingredients.  Three items with drinks and I got out if there just a hair over $30.    Cheap date with great food and so so service.

    "text": "Saw this on Fox 10 one morning and thought it looked good. My girlfriend is a celiac so finding breakfast places for her can be difficult, especially with places that sneak flower into eggs to make them fluffier (ihop). All of the omelets are gluten free (They do state that the kitchen is not gluten free so there is a chance of cross contamination) and are quite good. She had a cheese omelet with ham, I stuck with the plain and simple breakfast.   The quality of the food was good, I found that while my bacon was properly cooked, it wasn't as warm as I would have liked it. The eggs were cooked well but the best part of the plate were the grilled potatoes! On top of that is this apple cinnamon jelly for the toast that is a must have. The omelet was almost too cheesy but good size and not super greasy. It also came with a side, she chose the fruit which was fresh. The portions were perfect for what you pay for, I was full but didn't have to unbutton my pants when I left, which is the worst part about most breakfast joints, it really slows down the rest of the day.  To top off our meals I chose a regular coffee which wasn't too strong but had a great flavor. I'm not sure how often they change it out, but it fresh enough for my taste. My girlfriend had a caramel latte, which was really good, very smooth and not as bitter as it's Starbucks' counterpart.  The atmosphere was modern, with lots of outdoor seating. We were there on a Wednesday morning so it was not crowded and were in and out with time left on the parking meter outside. I believe that going here on a weekend would be a different story, as I'm sure it could get quite crowded. I would suggest not sitting right next to the fence or you may get a visit from one of Mill Ave's locals asking for spare change.  We will be going again, I'd like to try some of their other menu items",

Gave the friend the big build-up so was a bit embarrassed by the poor showing.   We ordered 2 Plain and Simples and they showed up pretty quickly. So far so good. However, the food was not hot, the bacon was undercooked and the potatoes were way overcooked. Not sure how the potatoes were overcooked, and still served at room temperature - but that's how it was. To cap off my experience, I found a long hair on my plate. I'm not squeamish, but I gotta say, \"yuk.\"  Restaurant 101: Someone needs to scrutinize every plate before it leaves the kitchen. Is the food hot? Is there a big friggin' hair in it?   We were the first customers on a Sunday morning, the cooks were probably hung-over college kids.   Oh, and while I'm at it - the coffee was weak and nearly devoid of flavor.  I'll be downtown in a few weeks, so will try it again and revisit / revise this review in the interest of fairness.  UPDATE: Went back a few weeks later, and it seemed to be back to it's usual quality. Would probably go again.",

    "text": "Right in the middle of downtown Tempe you will find a plethora of restaurants, bars and shops.  So what made us choose NCounter?  Well first of all we wanted breakfast and secondly you never say no to my cousin Tina.  So we entered a place that normally I would have walked past, well I am super happy we didn't pass this place up.  First and foremost if you see an empty table when you walk in, GRAB IT, they are as rare as Foie Gras is in California.  Next go stand in line to order and pay or you will never get fed.  So even though this place sort of starts out like a fast food restaurant, the attention to the food served severs that connection very quickly.  The food is really good and made to order.  I ordered The Killer breakfast sandwich.  It was a \"nearly\" fried egg with blue cheese, tomatoes and perfectly cooked bacon on a ciabatta roll.  The sandwich was very tasty I only wish I had switched out the bread, ciabatta is not my favorite bread and yet this one was still very soft and tasty.  Hubby got the Croque Monsieur, he liked his meal but he is spoiled and normally eats them at a real French restaurant so he wasn't over joyed.  However they gained points when he was served a spicy Bloody Mary, oh yes my friends they have a full bar.  So breakfast was good, but it is crazy in here.  People are coming and going all the time, it's crowded and REALLY LOUD (did you hear me?)  Also parking can be challenging.  We were very lucky because we were there on a Sunday and the College students are on break (ASU is right around the corner).  All in all, I would definitely like to have their food again, but I think next time I will take it to go and find a quiet spot to enjoy a gourmet breakfast.  Oh they have lunch items too, but don't go after 3pm because they will be closed.",

They must have changed their cooks of something because I come here all the time (at least once a week) and the past two times I've been here it's been awful...  My farmers Benedict was missing avocado and had un-ripe green tomatoes on it!! Ew. Next, I came for lunch today... And it was bad. The Roma chicken sandwich was SOGGY! The bread was so filled with liquid by the time it hit my plate that it fell apart in my hands, landed/splashed on my plate, and got on my shirt... Very disappointed.  What happened Ncounter? You use to be so reliable and delicious :(",

Potatoes were hot, and lots of them. Gluten Free toast was toasted perfect, had to go up to counter as they forgot butter (which I asked for). Their Americano coffee was a bit watered down, probably should have a smaller size cup for serving and add less water. Other than that this is a great spot, location right near the train line. I would recommend to go for breakfast.",

Loads of flavor packed into two slices of focaccia bread. Balance it out with the pasta salad. Would have given it 5 stars but the last time I was there I had the clam chowder and it was way too thick... Everyone loves a thick clam chowder but this was more like a steak gravy with potatoes. Couldn't get past the first bite. But if you don't order the clam chowder and you order any of the other salads sandwiches or breakfast items, you can't go wrong! Oh and for those of you who have a gluten allergy or celiac disease... This is a gluten Friendly restaurant!",

Service was excellent and the food came out fast. Also, the wait time really depends on when you go; for us, it was not more than 10 minutes on Friday at around 12:30.  I had their 10$ breakfast sandwich and my friend had their eggs benedict. Both were pretty good; the toast was crunchy and it had lots of flavor. However, my only gripe is that the food was more on the heavy side: my sandwich had a bit more cheese and oil than I would have liked. Nevertheless, I would still recommend you try it if you are around this area.",

The blueberry smoothie is worth going back for, but the biscuits and gravy were lack luster. They need some more flavor, the gravy had no wow factor and honesty I ended up taking it off the biscuits to just eat them. The biscuits were good, however mine had some burnt spots I had to eat around. Worth checking out, but don't expect for anything out of this world. :)",

Did a load of laundry, watered the plants, highlighted my hair, did some cleaning, unloaded the dishwasher, cleaned the pool, and patiently waited for my husband to wake up.  At 6:30 I pretended to drop something and woke him up.  I said, \"Hey!  Wanna try someplace new for breakfast?!?!?\"  He got dressed, put on his shades, and got in the car.  I love that man so much.  My goal was to get to Ncounter right when they open because I have read about how busy they get.    I really liked how pleasant and sunny the restaurant was, and ordering at the counter was easy.  We got the Greek omelet, the basic 2-egg breakfast with bacon, and a mocha.  They have nice sized water cups too.  This time of year I really appreciate that.    My Greek omelet was really nice.  Full of veggies and feta cheese.  Great flavors.  I also enjoyed the rye toast and what tasted like homemade apple cinnamon preserves.  Mr. M's 2 egg breakfast was very good as well.  The bacon was OUTSTANDING!  And I wish I would have shoved the toast aside to get a picture of the potatoes that came with his breakfast.  They were fried or roasted to a nice golden brown and really went well with the egg yolks.    My mocha was delicious as well.  Did I see they use Press coffee?  That totally makes sense.  I loved it.  With two breakfasts and the mocha, the total was $21.62 before tip.    I did happen to notice all the very fit people in the restaurant who looked like they just biked around Tempe Town Lake, or climbed that hill to the east of the restaurant.  I did none of those things.  Maybe next time.",

I said there's a whole line of folks who would love to be helped.  She says, \"Well, I said I could help who's next!\" as she inserts an eye roll and huffy sigh.  I explained it is loud, so we can't hear you speak, and placed my order.    Fortunately my experience improved from there. Soft drink selection was good, although self-service area is very tight.  Took my number to the patio and my pear and bacon omelet appeared shortly.   It was lovely, and although the sliced almonds added a strange texture, the flavors blended well.  The fruit was ripe and sweet.  Server brought silverware and a tiny napkin in a logo paper bag, cute!  He was very efficient and brought hot sauce and cleared tables quickly.   It began to rain so I moved inside and took a table.  I could then observe clearly how the line worked when there were 15 people in  it.  Much clearer.  Glad I missed the rush!",

I decided to get breakfast here before I ventured over to the mill ave bridge.  Man was this place packed.  But I after receiving my breakfast, Farmers Market Benedict, I learned why it was crowded.   My Farmers Market Benedict breakfast consisted of 2 poached eggs, spinach, tomato, avocado, and hollandaise sauce over and English muffin.  It came with a side of potatoes.     English muffin slightly toasted.  The eggs were perfectly poached.  Slightly cooked whites, barely set.  Yolk the consistency of pudding. Yummy yolky eggy pudding. If yolks that are not that pudding consistency, and you shouldn't call it poached.  Again, these eggs were perfect.  The spinach and tomato were as they should be, spinach slightly cooked, and tomato raw.  The avocado, hollandaise sauce, and side of potatoes added the finishing touches to this fantastic breakfast.   Seriously, just thinking about those eggs alone makes me want to go back this weekend.",

I didn't even touch the potatoes because they weren't fresh. Really, could have gone to McDonalds and been more satisfied.   Traveling for work, so I'll just keep trying different places.",

Then we waited for 45 minutes for our food. I asked a couple of times and was told they were slammed. The guy's next to us got their food in 15 minutes. When ours finally came (2 fried eggs and potatoes) it had two long dark haired in it... Not either of our hair. Ugh...I was super hungry.   I have it back and we asked for a refund. He did come over and refunded us both which was nice but never an acknowledgement of any poor service..Anything. sorry... Never again",

Eventually I got the GM on the phone, she was kind enough and did refund our card. She also offered to send a gift card as an apology. That was two weeks ago and we never received anything. It's too bad, but we don't have any plans to go back now - there are too many other good options nearby.",

Breakfast wasn't bad..waffles with fruit and eggs Benedict (nothing special to remember) but the salad I'll remember. My Bloody Mary costed 9 bucks. It was ok. When I want a Bloody Mary, I expect all the olives and celery and bells n whistles. Other than that, it's a good simple breakfast place.  Service was ok. Don't expect a sit down and server checking up on you. You go in, order, take a number, and they bring your food.

It was missing the avocado and was not served with salsa,, which it definitely needed with all of those potatoes. I'd suggest that Daily Jam drop the overpriced $9 burrito and stick to the other options that I know they prepare much better.",

After trying different eggs Benedict at different restaurants across different cities, I was sad to say this wasn't the best I've tried. The hollandaise sauce was overpowering and very thick. The avocado was past its peak of ripeness and the tomato lacked succulence. I did however enjoy my cup of vanilla latte. I had the chance to try the huevos ranchero and it was mediocre at best. I would come here again but wouldn't order what I go ever again. I did like the atmosphere and loved the outdoor seating.  I also loved the way and ease of ordering.

We like the fact that their patio is dog-friendly, and that they have water bowls for the pups.  If you're in the area, or just want a quick bite to eat for breakfast, give this place a chance.    Enjoy!",

Today I went back with my daughter and again they forgot my sauce for the burrito and my daughters pancakes were RAW in the middle! How does that happen? Then I noticed that they microwave the food before it's taken out to make it seem fresh and hot. Very deceptive and disappointing.",

    "text": "Your experience at NCounter begins by paying the bill, giving the place a fast-food feel, which is fine until the bill comes in at thirty dollars for bacon, eggs, and coffee for two. (Hint: Don't make people decide on their tip before they see your service. Making waiters work for tips is bad enough without front-loading the decision on a customer who hasn't had their coffee yet.)  Food quality is average for a diner, about Denny's-ish. Coffee was bland and below-average strength. It won't pick you up if you're not a morning person.   Bathrooms are clean and oddly stylish.   Lastly, if you have crowd-anxiety, avoid this place on the weekends. I went on Sunday for breakfast and shared the school-cafeteria-like dining room with at least a hundred people.    I really can't recommend it, overall. Noisy, crowded, and overpriced for what you get and the experience they provide.",

    "text": "I had lunch here about a year ago and finally got around to trying breakfast this weekend. When I arrived, the line looked really long, but it went surprisingly fast. I ordered the Hot Juan--an omelette with chorizo, cheese, and salsa, and my boyfriend ordered the blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage. My boyfriend also ordered a milk and was disappointed to find they don't actually serve you a glass of milk, but instead, they have those little Shamrock bottles. I went with the iced tea, and while the jasmine green tea was delicious, the passion tea tastes like Robutussin.  Our meal took about 20 minutes to come out. I think they might have lost our order because I notice people who sat after us got their orders first. Anywho, my omelette was good, but it was a bit too heavy on the cheese and salsa and didn't have enough chorizo. The side of potatoes that came with the omelette were amazing! I would definitely get those again. The blueberry pancakes and sausage were delicious, and even though I am a more savory breakfast person, I might order that next time.  The one thing I really disliked about breakfast is they had loud club type music playing the whole time. I know it's on Mill, but you would think they would make a different choice in music. And then in the midst of all the club music, some sad Bruno Mars song came on...it was weird.  I would have given this place 3 stars based on breakfast alone, but when I had lunch here, it was perfect! I highly recommend the Original Dagwood- turkey sandwich with havarti. The vibe was also a lot more relaxed at lunch (aka I didn't feel like I was at a club).",

My recommendations   Breakfast- grilled wheat germ granola Sandwich Hot- Portobellini Sandwich Cold- smokehouse avocado stack Salad- Original Chop (My FAVORITE SALAD) the presentation is colorful and beautiful, taste is scrumptious, and pesto dressing is amazing   Only downfall is it closes at 3pm too early for me.",

    "text": "This place is a little too DIY for me. I placed my order at the counter, passing pre-prepared cups of orange juice and baskets of napkins. This should have been my one and only clue... But it was early and I was thinking with my \"hangry brain. \"  I ordered a latte and it was delivered to me without sugar options or stirs. So I got up to find the missing pieces to my beverage.   My Eggs Benedict was delivered to me with silverware wrapped in a napkin, thank goodness for that much. Unfortunately, I'm a two-napkin (min) eater, so I needed a few more. This waitress was sweet and offered to fetch me some.  Now I know I wrote in my tip that the latte was decent, it was in fact very good. It was so strong that six packets of sugar later, it was slightly sweet.   For a place that was loud and packed, I got my breakfast faster than expected. The kitchen is definitely doing something right. There is also outdoor seating if you don't want to sit inside the noisy mess hall.  Ncounter has this incredible opportunity to be more \"green\" if they chose to offer coffee mugs as well as paper cups. It's surprisingly cost-saving and since only the staff carries the dishes across the restaurant, low in risk of breakage.  Also, all of these napkins and utensil-bags could be compostable. And sugar packets switched out for sugar dispensers. Imagine if Ncounter was a zero waste/zero landfill establishment...  I only mention all of this because of the excellent job in branding this restaurant possesses. It's modern and open and clearly focused on efficiencies. There is even an Ncounter-branded bike locked up outside. All of this points to an earth-conscious brand, so I was a little disappointed to see the flagrant wastefulness inside.  Overall, I might be back for the Eggs Benedict.",

Some of our food was handed to us as we stood waiting on a table to open up, other food was delivered to our table 30 minutes later and finally, after 45 minutes our two veggie omelets were delivered after repeated trips to the kitchen, interrupting the texting servers and asking them where our order was.  I attempted to contact a manager to show him/her our burned omelets but could not get anyone's attention.  Finally left out of frustration without eating the burned omelets.

Eating here is like watching reality television, in that it's very bad and we should all stop doing it  Consistently average food in a cool location with OK service. The only redeeming things about Ncounter (Jesus I hate the name even more now that I type it) are that I can crawl there from my condo and the coffee is self-serve.  The food I regrettably find myself coming back here for is the killer, a breakfast sandwich on ciabatta which is about 60% gorgonzola cheese and the rest dark personal shame and bacon.  In short, if you are trying to wake up tomorrow and do a little bit better than you did today, please skip Ncounter. This review was mostly to talk myself out of ever coming back here.

    "text": "Went yesterday for the first time, and I had a really nice breakfast.    Had the Farmer's Market, pretty much a play on egg's benedict but with avocado and spinach, so like egg's florentine with avocado? yeah?  The potatey's weren't piping hot, which doesn't bother me at all...I'd actually prefer them not to be.  It reminded me of my dad though, something he'd be all pissy about and want to send back to warm up....So if you're bringing a friend like that there, beware.  The potatoes were really good though, they weren't all greasy and diner tasting, they were as healthy as potatoes can get maybe? The farmer's market was awesome though, not greasy, really light, lots of flavor, and a pretty presentation.  The hollandiase sauce was the perfect consistently, not too thick, and definitely not too thin, and not drenched all over the place. The english muffin was the perfect texture..I hate when it's a hard muffin and you can't cut it, that's the worst. And lots of avocado... thank you!  People can be so stingy with the avocado....feelin' you guys! The farmer's market paired with my bellini, a cutie patio, my friends and the shins playing?  I'd say we did pretty good.  Speaking of my bellini, it was really refreshing, and mostly champagne...feelin' you again Ncounter/ bartender!  When it was dropped off she actually said, \"lots of champagne in this one\"...I was definitely not mad about that.  And what I thought was fruit inside of it, was actually a peach o ring, like that!  And I ate it at the end, definitely a champagne ring, new fav?   My friends got the eggs benedict, the fruit and granola, some of their toast with their signature (not vignature...vig regulars what's up?) cinnamon apple jam? I think that's what type of jam it was..whatever type of jam, it was delish.    My friends also really liked their food and the overall ambiance of a place seemingly reminiscent to LGO but over in the Tempe area.   Speaking of LGO...Ncounter's food I think is better than LGO's.  There are very few things at LGO that have blown my mind, it's just nice to go there, because it's super cute, a nice neighborhood, something for everyone, picnic tables...you know why we all like it.  Realistically I love going to LGO, because it's always a lovely time with my friends.  BUT I think Ncounter offered an awesome brunch with my friends, and the food was better.    Ncounter will definitely be a new regs place for us... in fact I'll be back today? The salads that went by looked amazing.      Last thing that needs to be said....GET THE PUMPKIN COOKIE.  Holy fricken mother, I think we all died and went to heaven eating that cookie.  I am not even kidding... if those were around me everyday...easily the fast track to morbid obesity.  This being said, you should defs give Ncounter a try.",

NCounter answered my prayers. I ordered the eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon. So delicious! It's really easy to make the hollandaise sauce too tart. So not the case here. It was very filling and I had the potatoes on the side. My boyfriend got the Pear omelette and it was sweet and salty, the perfect combination. For a drink I ordered an iced chai tea. Perfect! I have tasted iced chais that have tasted like soap before so I was pleasantly surprised when this didn't taste like it. Did you know they also serve breakfast cocktails?? That's right for only $5 bucks you can get a mimosa, Bellini, or bloody Mary. Most places charge like $7. It's within walking distance from my house and steps away from the light rail. Whether you are a meat eater or non meat eater there is bound to be an item that will satisfy your palette.",

Ordered some pancakes, the house Ncounter omelet and a couple of drinks from the coffee bar.   We were told by the bartender to go fetch our own silverware and water. Our food arrived prior to our drinks and my omelet was REALLY cold - like I mean the broccoli was still slightly frozen - too bad considering it's their house specialty - the hashbrowns were also undercooked and the cream cheese glob was just overkill on the omelet.  Our coffees finally showed up, bu they must have run short on milk since there was a two inch gap at the top of my cup.  Fortunately, the pancakes were pretty darn good.   Needless to say, we won't be making the drive from Phoenix again any time soon...",

We arrived at 9:30 a.m. before any rush, which is ALWAYS a huge plus. I felt lucky. The ladies at the counter were perky for a Sunday morning, which is more than I could say for myself...COFFEE PLEASE!   After deliberating with my friend about which two dishes to choose out of the dozens that sounded fantastic, I ordered The Pear-- complete with bosc pear, havarti cheese, sliced almonds and bacon. My friend ordered the huevos and chorizo! These meals were tres bien and aye aye aye awesome, respectively. The Pear had crispy bacon served up in the cheesy goodness, which was balanced out by the crisp pears and almonds. I enjoyed the array of tastes present. I topped mine off with a Bloody Mary, which was served in a tall glass with just the right amount of spice. Hurray!  The huevos and chorizo was the right amount of mess. The combination of chorizo, onions, grilled potatoes, salsa, cheese with flour tortilla can never steer me wrong after any night, especially a long one. Our waters were consistently refilled for us by wandering good-looking waiters. The aesthetics and atmosphere looked and felt good to me. There is also the right amount of people-watching one can do here, from the hungover sorority types, to the bicycling hipsters, and cheery family members and friends greeting one another. I was entertained.  However, the queue steadily grew towards the door while we enjoyed our conversation and brekkie. So, while I love it, I will never go there during the rush hours. I totally understand some of the frustration about wait times. SO! That said, overall experience was fantastic and I'll get my slow butt up early for breakfast again and again! :)",

They were ready for the crowd and although the line was long, it moved quickly and the staff was friendly.  The coffee was good and the scone was tasty. After loop one on the bike we decided we needed something more substantial than a scone (spectating is hard work!) and returned to NCounter for lunch.  It was packed.  But again, although there was a line, it moved quickly and the staff was friendly.  A table opened just before we got to the cashier and I grabbed it.  We both had the vegetarian omelet with a side of toast.  I don't know what the jam was but it was tasty!  I think it may have been an apple cinnamon?  Very Fall flavorful.  The omelet was big and full of good veggies and cheese.  Everything was fresh and it wasn't at all greasy.  It came out nice and hot.  I would have eaten here again had I stayed longer.

Roland (employee) asked what I was looking for and said they had some in the back but I said I was ok. Without me knowing he went in the back, got a to-go container of coffee and tracked me down on the street to give it to me. Will definitely give them my business next time in town. Roland is the man!",

The food was good, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant for such a busy place.  There was plenty of seating, too.  This will be a great place for those headed to a game to stop in for a bite to eat either on the way there or on their way back because the lightrail is right across the street.  I have also tried this owner's other restaurant, T.C. Eggington's in Mesa and really like it too.",
