She wouldn't take half of our drink orders and she didn't get out dinner orders right.  We were still patient and calm until she decided she wasn't going to fix our orders and she wouldn't bring us more drinks.  When I asked for a manager she said she was the manager and there was no one else I could speak to!  I've never witnessed something like that at a restaurant and they should be embarrassed by their service!!  It blows my mind!  There are much better restaurants in the area that are guaranteed to have better service.  Fast food restaurants have better service and nicer staff.",

The chips and salsas that you get are substandard by comparison to places a lot cheaper. The food does taste excellent, however my wife's chicken came out very raw. They gladly took it back and gave us a free dessert for the problem.  If they had lower prices I would rate it higher but the prices dont justify a higher star rating.",

Take everything you love about Mexican food and make it gourmet with fabulous presentation, and place it just past downtown Scottsdale.

I have thoroughly enjoyed myself each time I have been here, and I will always go back.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is family owned.

We were there on a weeknight and it was cold but because the had heated lanterns and small fire pits, we chose to eat on the patio.  Not all the lanterns were turned on and they sat us almost on top of the table next too us and it made it difficult to get in and out of our chairs. We asked to be seated somewhere else but they did'nt want to turn on the lanterns and it was a 30 min wait to get inside. That aside, the food was pretty good and the menu deffinately unique, but the service was very poor.  They were friendly but very slow and not very attentive and it wasn't that busy.",

Considering I pretty much hated all the food in Phoenix or Scottsdale, this review should go pretty far.  The guac is great, the tortilla soup is hearty, filling, and tasty, and the shrimp dish is amazing.  Cheesy, with tortilla strips and loads of shrimp.  Well balanced.  I hate phoenix, but I love sombrero's.   Don't get take out, it loses its flavor.  Plus dining outside is pretty dope.",

Well, maybe it's not perfect, but my meals here over the past five years have always been good, and I consider Los Sombreros a great place to take out-of-town guests. If I were to grade it on a pretentiousness scale, it actually rates better and is more inviting than Barrio Cafe. So give the place a break -- try the guacamole, the chicken mole, the lamb adobo, any of the skirt steak entrees and any of the seafood dishes.",

Steve behind the bar recomended it and made me a deliciouse one with gran marnier? whatever it was, it was delicious and we had 2 each at the table.

The patio is great because in the winter they have heaters and on the weekends a guy sitting outside playing guitar and singing in Spanish, making for great ambiance.   But this is tough because I've been to this place and gotten 5 star service and meal, and then I've gone and gotten 2 star service and meals.  So I've settled for in between.   As for the menu they do have excellent, authentic mole which is hard to come by.  I personally adore the lamb dish  which is fall off the bone delicious as well as the rib-eye if you are looking for a nice protein.  If you are more in the mood for something in a tortilla their shrimp and fish tacos or seafood enchiladas are both stuffed with fresh seafood and dressed with homemade sauces.  They serve healthful sides like black beans, brown rice and fresh veggies.  To end the night I highly recommend the chocolate pie which has a toasted almond crust and creamy, chocolate mouse filling.  On a side note you can buy tamales in the winter months full of fun flavors, like chocolate and pineapple.",

The food is better, and the original menu is intact. They have added a few new things, too. They've actually lowered prices on some items a little! They've done some redecorating inside. Now that the weather is nice the outside patio is lovely. Great restaurant for the food of Central Mexico! If you haven't been for awhile, try it again.   We have been fans of Los Sombreros at the original Scottsdlae Rd location for years. We renewed our friendship this past weekend. We had been going to the newer Northsight Rd location because it is closer to our house. Unfortunately, it has closed and we sort of forgot about the original. We are very happy we stopped in to have dinner. The food was as good and original as it has always been. We've always liked the patio with it's fluffy trees better. We reconnected with our friends on the loyal staff. My favorite dish is the hibiscus enchiladas and my husband had rellenos. Both are prepared in the style of Central Mexico. This is a little different from the usual border, Tex-Mex style of most local places.  If you've been going to the Northsight location and found it closed, drive a little further south and go to the original. It is worth a trip!",

    "text": "I was going to Sidewalk Surfer across the road and had seen this Mexican restaurant before so to sooth my curiosity I stopped in for lunch.  Always on the lookout for Chile Rellenos made with Poblano chile I was extremely glad to find theirs were. The price seemed a bit high but where I'm from the only place that had Poblano chile Rellenos was only slightly lower.  I was very surprised and pleased when my order came and there were TWO Rellenos. (By the way the place I was referring to has gone out of business)  There were 3 kinds of hot sauce: mild, tomatillo, and habenero. I didn't know you got all 3 so I asked for the tomatillo and habenero and got 2 of tomatillo 1 habenero. Both were execellent!!!  The Rellenos were excellent! The server had subbed the \"chunky tomato\" sauce to the chipotle tomato sauce for me. Did I mention that the Rellenos were the best I've had?  It makes a big difference using a Poblano chile instead of a hatch or anihiem chile in my opinion. Sombreros off to Los Sombrero for doing so.",

It was so incredible that our guests could not get enough and the Los crew was kind enough to serve one last round to a few guests, even after they had packed up for night. This team of talented caterers & servers went the extra mile to find out what was most important to us that night and made the experience flawless for us.  I highly recommend Los Sombreros for any special event or party you might be planning!",

It is about a mile south of Old Town so doesn't draw the big tourist crowds. Their loss is my gain as this place is very good.  I made a reservation through Open Table a week ahead and we arrived a little after 6:00 p.m. on Friday night (May 11). My wife and I were promptly seated on the patio (which has plenty of shade and misters), and then greeted by our server. The service was good and friendly all evening.  The chips are good, the salsa is OK (could use a bit more kick), the margaritas are very good, and the food is very good. My wife had chicken, and I had ribeye tacos with a side of green beans & bacon.  Despite being south of Old Town there was a good crowd. Everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves. We will definitely be back.",

We told him no, but we live in the neighborhood and just drove by and decided to try it. He then walked us through almost everything on the menu, gave us so many great recommendations, and made us feel very welcomed. We sat at the bar and had margaritas, chips and guacamole, chicken tacos, and mushroom quesadillas. The food is Mexico City-style (my favorite), and everything was excellent and reasonably priced for happy hour. Now that we know about this authentic neighborhood spot, we will definitely be visiting regularly. I highly recommend and can't wait to go back!",

We were seated on the delightful patio near a woman with two annoying dogs. Despite relatively low density of clientele, took a while to be seen, have our orders recorded, and served. We pursued several activities while waiting, including visits to the bathrooms, which had bizarrely overengineered and rickety doors. One of a party was locked in and had to be pried out via jaws of life. We also speculated about the crime scenes the CSI officers were coming from or going to while waiting in line for takeout. We noticed the officers were in and out before we were able to place orders, which inspired us to spawn conspiracy theories about them intimidating the fine workers of Los Sombreros. Anyway, when the food finally arrived, it was decent. Tacos were pretty small for the price. I will do a truck next time.",

    "text": "I was visiting Scottsdale and was looking for great Mexican food.  I live in Boston, where we have great food, and even a couple of very good Mexican restaurants, but I figured that in the Southwest, Mexcellence would abound.  Boy, was I wrong!    I read all the reviews on Yelp of dozens of restaurants, and finally decided to try Los Sombreros for a late dinner on Friday night, Feb 6 2009.  I was in AZ by myself, so I figured I'd eat at the bar and get a great eye on how the place worked.  Many Yelpers mentioned a lively bar scene, Steve the bartender, his attentiveness & his margaritas, so I headed there hoping he'd be working.   Well, no Steve.  And my first disappointment was that not one Yelper mentioned that the bar is OUTSIDE!!  I know it's Arizona, but a cold front had come through & it was only 48 degrees.  I'm a Bostonian.  I'm not afraid of the cold, but if even one Yelper had mentioned that the bar was outdoors, I'd have chosen another restaurant.  The bar also has only 6 seats (well, 7 if you count the one where the pole in your face is closer to you than the worst seat at Fenway or in the old Boston Garden - that seat lacks bar top space sufficient to even hold a drink).  As a salsamaniac, I was looking forward to the salsa because so many Yelpers had raved about it.  People!!  When the salsa is a tomatillo salsa, you should at least mention that fact!  42 reviews and not one person thought to mention that the salsa is green?!?  I love tomatillos, but I was looking forward to a tomato-based salsa and didn't get one.  And as tomatillo salsas go, this was average, at very best.   I loved the fact that later in the evening, Los Sombreros re-activates its happy hour menu & offers a variety of plates for $5. That was cool, and I tried the guac & chips.  Again, disappointment.    The avocado had some brown spots and the chunks were so big that they snapped every single chip I tried to use to \"dip\" into the guac.  The only way to eat it was to use the fork to pick up the avocado chunks and put them on the chips.  I can't even say that the avocado was diced.  It was chunked, at best, so the \"guacamole\" consisted of chunks of avocado & a little seasoning.   And speaking of the chips . . . at even an average Mexican restaurant, I expect them to be warm & well-salted.  These were cold, slightly stale, huge and virtually salt-free.   I ordered a margarita.  At a Mexican restaurant, especially when I'm seated at the bar, I don't expect to see my margarita poured out of a pre-mixed bottle.  And I don't expect it to taste worse than the pre-mixed Cuervo margaritas we had at the last Jimmy Buffett tailgate.  If crowds necessitate making your house margarita in batches ahead of time, that's understandable.  But don't pour from the big tub for the people actually seated at the bar.  That's just dumb bar management.   My entree was a delicious sounding shrimp, tortilla & cheese concoction (I apologize for neglecting to write down its actual name).  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, either.  It arrived looking like a Mexican shrimp & cheese casserole, with pieces of tortilla so large that two cuts of each tortilla piece were necessary in order to create an appropriately-sized bite.  The shrimp were delicious, but come on - how tough is it to cook shrimp?  The tortillas, tomatoes and cheese were messy & melty, but there was nothing special about the dish.  The strongest flavor came from the shrimp, and that should tell you a lot.   Overall, I felt cheated.  I wasted one of my few evenings in Scottsdale on Mexican food and a restaurant experience easily beatable on Route 1 in Medford, MA at anyplace with a sombrero you choose to try.    Seriously - steer well clear of Los Sombreros.  You can save a bundle by going to the grocery store & picking up some Old El Paso.  It won't be worse.",

    "text": "Went to Los Sombreros beginning of April 2009 right when they opened around 5:00 p.m.  Had baby in carrier with husband.  We usually sit at the bar outside, but with the baby, we wanted to be seated on patio.    We ate chips and salsa.  don't like the little dorito wheels that come wedged in the chip basket.  The salsas are just alright and the tiny bowls aren't big enough for even the two of us.  Got crab queso.  It was good. We filled up on that and when my husband's carnitas (used to be our fav) came, so did the flies.  Yea, the regular dumpster variety.  ILK!!!!  We were surrounded by about 20 flies.  They were landing on the food and us, and biting.  The service was poor.  We finally got her to come over and we wanted to pack up the food and get out of there.  I had fish.  Oh yea, and a margarita.  They seemed  fine, but on we go...  The waitress noticed the flies and shooed them away while she gave us the \"to go\" boxes.  Our bill was about $70 with tip.    We didn't eat the rest of our leftovers that night.  But the NEXT night, we warmed up the carnitas and ate it up.  It seemed fine.  The next morning we woke up with severe vomiting and diarrhea.  This lasted for 2 days.  I went to the ER and had to get 3 liters of saline from dehydration.  Now, we think this all came from the carnitas.  Perhaps we should have not eaten it a day later.  Maybe it was on it's last legs the night they served it and that extra day...it turned bad.  We can't be sure.  Stomach flu has been going around so it could have been that.  Thing is, we both got sick at the exact same moments.  Hummm... Won't be going back.  Ever.  Sad...",

    "text": "Didn't like the salsa or the chips - and that's a pretty important component of Mexican food. They were kinda rude to us as well... although I will say they were attentive and informative. I guess it's just that they had us feeling like we weren't good enough to eat there. They were pretty strict about substitutions too - as in, they were against them. They don't seem to want to let you have flour tortillas instead of corn. Personally, I find corn tortillas to be quite vile.  Another staple they offer that wasn't very impressive was the margarita. It tasted like just a grocery store-bought mix that they stuck expensive tequilla in (if you pay extra - the standard issue is Cuervo). I had some tacos and they were good, but they didn't blow me away. They did end up agreeing to make them with flour tortillas, but as the dish was handed to me I was informed that they would never do it that way for me again. Huh? Wow, so I had a one of a kind meal.  My rating may be a little misleading because I think other people would like it more than I did. I think it's a nice environment - cute little restaurant inside, and great patio outside (that would be better when it's not so hot). I want to give this a 2.5, but can't and I don't consider this to be a 3... however, as you can see from the other reviews, I'm in the minority here.   I think I may be a little too fussy and cheap to eat here - I like my food simple and they over-complicate the dishes and over-charge for them. They won't let me substitute things (which is something you can't do to a fussy person) or even leave something off the dish. This indicates to me either a level of pretentiousness or some degree of incompetence... I think it's the former rather than the latter. The prices for the entrees are way too high for what you're getting. The value just isn't there for me. My friend says this is his favorite Mexican restaurant, so maybe this might be your kinda place.",

    "text": "I'm in Phx this week to visit the male parental unit. I couldn't wait to get some good Mexican food in during my visit, because we all know what extremely limited selection there is on the East Coast. Upon Yelping it, I was surprised to see how low many of the Mexican places were rated in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area! I settled on this place out of convenience and it had the least fluctuation in ratings.   Now there were 4 of us vegetarians here, and I did not for a second think this would be an issue. Mexican food is probably one of the easiest to make \"vegetarian-ish\", and most places I have been to have several veggie options on the menu. Not so for this place!! The only veggie entree on the entire menu was chille relenos, and they were able to concoct cheese enchiladas and a 'veggie plate' (which we did not end up getting, why would we pay all that money for a plate of vegetables!?).   Between the 4 of us, we got a large order of guac, 2 cheese enchiladas, and a chille relenos. My dad and I each got Patron Silver magaritas too. Here's the breakdown:  Great: -The guac was superb and I would attribute one of the stars just to that. I love guac anyways though, so it's really difficult to rate poorly for me. -The enchiladas were also great and you could tell the tortillas were homemade - yum!!  Good: -Margaritas. Pretty good, and pretty strong (had only 1/2 of mine and could feel it!). Tasty marg mix. -Patio with heat lamps was a fun ambiance, although it looked a bit chaotic (too many chairs at our table, heat lamps scattered all over the place, etc). -Accoutrements such as black beans, rice, and veggies. Standard fare, decent taste.  Meh: -The chille relenos were bleh. Soggy in their sauce, and really really cheesy (like too much so. tasted rubbery.) -Salsa that came with the chips was not that good! That's usually one of my fave parts about Mexican restaurants is the fresh and delish salsa. Not so with this place!  Double Meh:  -Service!! Sheesh the place wasn't THAT busy it was a Tuesday night, but after our waitress took our order we didn't see her at all, even after we had already asked for more chips and salsa and my dad had asked for habenero salsa (he has taste bud issues in that he has none). It practially took my round-ish dad flying out of his seat and tackling the waitress in order to have her come by again just so we could *remind* her of what we had already asked for 10 minutes earlier! And we could tell when the food came out that it may have been sitting there for a bit; it was just meh warm not piping hot as it should have been.  -Price. I thought for this meal, $105 (incl tip) was a bit ridiculous, especially since the cheese enchiladas, while they were good, were just glorified quesadillas (which were $5.95 on the app menu).   Wouldn't go back here, but we did leave full (mainly due to chips/salsa/guac).",

    "text": "I thought all was lost in Scottsdale, how could we be living so close to Mexico and not have a descent Mexican restaurant and then I found Los Sombreros. My goodness the food is amazing, the margaritas, to die for. The entire staff was extremely helpful. They just cant go wrong.   I have only been there twice and both times I was thoroughly impressed. I had the Enchiladas de pollo my first time, delicious, and my dining partner had the Mole Poblano (He's from Mexico City and he said its one of the best mole hes had in the states)  Second time around I had the Tacos dorados, and a few appetizers, the guacamole and the Tortilla soup are a must, they are outrageously awesome.  The only down side is it can get pretty warm inside, we ask to move outside to the misted patio and were completely comfortable.",

    "text": "I was not that impressed. Ok, bear with me. Let me tell you a little story.   My family loves Mexican food. I think I've finally convinced them to forgo On the Border for some better fare. Well, since they were in the Scottsdale area one Saturday afternoon, I thought we'd try Los Sombreros. I said I'd meet them there. Good thing I brought the book I was reading (Summer People by Brian Groh - fantastic). My family was running late, and I discovered that it's a little hard to serve food when you're closed on a busy weekend day. Saturday afternoon? Closed? You're kidding me... Well, I took a spot on a bench and read. Lucky for me, I could text a friend to consider other possibilities in the area. Los Olivos was where we ended up. (Ugh. Don't get me started on that place.)   ANYHOW, I thought I'd give Los Sombreros another chance. I met my text-savvy friend the next evening for dinner. I arrived and snatched up a table on the patio. The hostess said it was the most popular table. Go figure, even if it's by all the little propane tanks surrounding the palms. I quickly ordered a Lager and drank happily while I waited. The menu presented a little bit of a challenge. Resist the amazing-looking entrees for dinner (and spare myself $17) or just splurge? I went with the fish tacos, since that's what the waiter recommended. What I got was not expected. Three mini tacos that were a challenge to eat. They reminded me of the signature dish you'd get at Pink Taco. I wasn't impressed. Later that evening, my tummy wasn't impressed, either.   So, would I go back? Eh. Maybe. I'd like my family to try this place during operating hours. If I go back, I'll get one of their more appealing dishes, like the lamb or crab. They definitely surprise you with their take on Mexican cuisine. I like the looks of the menu. I just hope not everything they serve leaves me wanting, like those messy, greasy and so-so tacos did.   3 stars for Los Sombrerors. 5 stars for Summer People.",

Sliced radishes, real cotija cheese, mole, etc.   Do yourself a favor while the evenings are nice, bring the special someone or family and dine on the patio. Highly recommend the Quesadillas Mexico City style to start off; nothing like it in town and positively delicious with a cold beer or margarita on the rocks. And, we are supporting our local owned joints!!",

    "text": "I've been here twice now, once was a solid 4-stars, the other, a solid 1-star.  I must add, the 4-star experience may have been clouded by their ($13) Patron Margarita.  First meal was a wonderful Carne Adobada with black beans and rice.  Meat was tender and juicy, sauce was GLUTEN-FREE and super tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, however, the $16 price tag was a little steep.  My second meal was Carnitas and they sucked.  The pork was tough and lacked any real flavor and came topped with literally a teaspoon of pico de gallo leaving the plate 90% plain pork and 100% boring.  I do like the fact they have their gluten-free options highlighted on their online menu, and can provide that same menu in-store, on-demand.  I'm 1 for 2 at this place, perhaps I'll try it again, but if I don't, I'm sure I won't lose any sleep over it.",

    "text": "I ate here on a Sunday evening, the place was relatively busy but not as packed as I've heard it gets on Friday and Saturday nights. We were seated right away on the cute little patio outside, facing the back of the restaurant I might add, so you get none of the noise from Scottsdale Rd. They've really made the outside look quaint and inviting, both in the front and the back.   I was a little surprised to see the high prices on the menu but I think that's just because I'm skeptical of any Mexican/Southwestern restaurant that's expensive. I've been disappointed in the past. I ordered the Carne en chile colorado (chunks of beef in a guajillo sauce, spinach and potatoes) and after a few bites I knew I ordered the right thing. Although I have a feeling ordering anything on the menu would have been \"the right thing.\"   The party I was with all loved their entrees and we all enjoyed sipping our Patron Silver Margaritas. Usually I don't get too excited over Margaritas at a restaurant because they all taste the same to me but I especially liked that this one wasn't crazy-super sweet and that it was strong, of course. The sweetness can sometimes make me feel like I ate a bowl of candy but not these. I'm sure the Patron Silver had something to do with it too. ;-P  The service was a little spotty as our waitress didn't come around much and I asked for water I didn't receive. Although I  was already done with most of my meal before I remembered, and by that time it wasn't a concern. The  food was so good I didn't care.",

We have eaten plant based/vegan for the last 4 years and it is not easy to find delicious food that is not heavy or lacking in flavor.

Why would I pay $3 more when I can order off the regular menu? I mentioned that to her and I guess she didn't understand what I was saying so she won't charge me the $3 \"this time\". Asked to \"try\" some of their guacamole before I purchased it. The look on her face was, well like she didn't know what to do. She finally said ok and brought me about a spoonful of it,  nasty is what comes to mind. No flavor to it, at all. Just an avocado toast, no tomatoes flavor, nothing. I'm not happy with the taste of their food and how I was told to pay an additional $3 I also had to ask about Taco Tuesday. Only reason I knew about it, another server mentioned it to guests that were sitting by us. There was no cheese in the taco I got even though menu mentioned it.  Would I go back, nope. Would I recommend it, probably not.  One more thing. They need to change the air filters, kinda nasty when you look up",

    "text": "I arrived at Los Sombrero's around 7:30 pm on a Friday night. Although it's located on a major street, the restaurant has a nice 'tucked-away' feeling.   There was plenty of parking, and plenty of seating, which I definitely was not expecting on a Friday night. While it wasn't busy, it was by no means a ghost town. There were plenty of people there to give it a lively atmosphere, but there was enough space to give it a more private feel in the outdoors area where my girlfriend and I sat.   Our waitress came to us rather quickly after we were seated. She was professional, friendly, and very efficient all evening. The food was good, not amazing. I ordered 3 soft shell chicken tacos, and the portions were not huge. I ordered a side of rice too, but wasn't a huge fan of it and felt that it was a tad overcooked.The chips and salsa that we had was absolutely delicious! I was a very big fan of the salsa, as well as the chips.   All in all, the atmosphere was fun, but nothing too special. The food was average, but the service was great.",

    "text": "My overall rating dipped a star from my last visit.  The service here sucks!  They appeared to be fully staffed during the dinner hour, yet it took more than five minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence at the wait stand.  Employees were milling around tending to more important stuff, I guess.  Not sure what ranks above a potential paying customer. When I was finally seated and attended to, it didn't get much better.  The waiter was curt and impatient.    The food wasn't bad.  I opted for a house margarita (no bueno/poorly made) and two of the appetizers.  I must say the appetizers were great. This restaurant offers a twist on what I consider traditional Mexical cuisine.  They do a nice job so the flavors aren't so outlandish and out of line with what you're expecting.  They also provide you with chips and salsa to start.  The chips were light, crispy and freshly made; however, the salsa left tons to be desired.  They brought two varieties out with the chips and I didn't care for either one.  Both lacked flavor.   Los Sombreros could really improve in my eyes if they acted like they gave a damn about their customers.  I didn't get that impression on either visit.",

    "text": "The food is typically delicious.  It is New Mexican cuisine, not Central Mexican, etc.  Just ask them- they'll tell you.  This used to be one of our favorites, but they got too full of themselves as they got too full of customers.  They skimped on some ingredients (though you'd never know unless you started eating there soon after it opened).  The service became rude, with a few pleasant exceptions.  They started to nickel and dime (e.g. serving a tiny amount of Chipotle salsa and charging for a refill). They began adding an 18% gratuity to parties larger than four, then providing service deserving of no tip at all (and I am typically pretty generous since I know what being a server is like and appreciate that most servers are struggling financially).  We avoid it now.  However, we found the Blue Adobe in Mesa.  The food there is as good (which is a compliment) and the service is usually very friendly and attentive.  Try this place once, and see for yourself.  For a good test, go with a party of 6.",

We had trouble even finding staff to get seated, almost left but I persisted and we were seated by a friendly host. Everything we ordered was delicious, the shrimp queso fondido is a must try in my opinion. Not a huge menu but I'm confident everything on the menu would be a hit. Chips and a salsas come out as expected and by the time we got our appetizer the restaurant had filled nicely to provide a much more normalized atmosphere. Portions were good sizes and the food was we'll prepared and tastey but you'll see the cost for it when you get the bill. That's really the only downside, I'd love to make this my go to regular spot but the price puts it in a once in a while treat spot.

    "text": "Visisted this restaurant with my family recently.  I lived many years in Mexico so I know what the cusine should be like.  This restaurant is fairly authentic and has many things you don't find in other Mexican restaurants.  For the most part, their food is very good.  Of all the things we had, the only thing we didn't like was their \"Spanish\" rice.  It has an odd flavor because it is spiced with cumin.  Cumin is not used in Mexican cuisine (or if it is, it must be very rare).  The better dishes, like Lamb Adobo, are pricier than the usual snack-type meals like tacos but are worth it.  They don't provide complementary chips.  They have them but you have to pay for them (welcome to Scottsdale).  Their salsas have out of the ordinary flavors but are good.  They run mild.  So if you want decent heat, ask for their Habanero sauce.  They have Tecate beer, but not on tap :-(   Margaritas are good.  Their limeade is homemade and good.  Their desserts are delicious.  We had flan and a Mexican chocolate creme pie.  The service is very authentic.  This means that if you expect American service, you will be disappointed.  Mexican service is deliberately slow and waiters must be summoned for service.  It's a cultural thing.  People are expected to take a long time at meals, eating slowly to enjoy their meal and enjoying each other's company.  If you are in a hurry, this is not the place to go.  If you can handle this type of service, the food is worth the bother.",

We literally had to ask for more water and another cocktail more than once and we had to beg for our check (table next to us was asking the same thing - she asked 3 times for their check)  #2. Food was bad. Carnitas was plain, plain, plain. My wife's enchilada was cold.  #3. Prices were RIDICULOUS!!!! For my wife and I to have enchilada dinner (cheese), carnitas dinner, guacamole with chips, and 2 margaritas was $65.70 before tip. That's insane....oh yeah dinner took 1 hr and 15 mins at a Mexican restaurant.   Diners beware!!!",

I made a reservation for 16 people and the tables they set apart for us were way too close to the wall to the point that it was uncomfortable to some of my guests. We had to move the table ourselves. The server kept forgetting our waters. My little cousin (5 year old) was thirsty and we had to tell the server three times. My cousin's margarita tasted weird and when she asked for a new one, the server gave her an attitude. The server barely stopped by our table. By the time we were ready to pay, the server was eating his dinner a few tables down from us and it took him a while to come get our check. No wonder the place was empty. The gratuity was really high and they don't split checks. Paying was a huge hassle as we had to calculate how much we each had to pay. Most places that don't split checks, will figure out how much goes on each card if you tell them what you ordered. I will not be coming back and do not recommend this place.",

But oh well, I did it.  Let's start with the positive.   Great patio and dining room. A pretty cool door in the bathroom-although there's rust in the sink and it's not that clean. Service was just OK (there you go, the 2 stars right there).  What i didn't like:  1. Labeling. It's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants call food a name that it's not accurate. Tortilla soup is more a Caldo Xochitl (tortilla soup has a tomato base broth). Rompope has no tequila.  2. Food. Cuitlacoche crepes tasted good but they had an after taste of burned oil. Tortilla soup was lame and well, not a tortilla soup. Mole was thin. Chiles rellenos had like pound and a half or cheese. It was just offensive the amount of cheese stuffed in this things. Bean & cheese tacos (kids menu) were bad. Guacamole was packed with onions and serrano chile, too overwhelming (I belive it was serrano). Rompope was just alcohol with milk, it tasted ok, but nothing impressive.   The only dish I really liked was the chocolate cake. That was tasteful.   3. Price. The price is ridiculous, specially what you get for it.  Most likely, I won't go back.  The best (worst) part is that they rather not accept American Express. They try to push you to use something else. wow",

(Think googling food items or speaking Spanish) they are pretty pricey (two people for $60), and have a lot of stipulations like not splitting checks and limits on soft drink refills. Overall, our was a fun environment and good service. We went at 5pm on a Monday, and it was not crowded, but I imagine it gets much more crowded toward the weekend and with all the students. There is a whole outdoor patio/dining room and bar separate from the main dining room. It's an adorable building. Check out the bathroom doors, they are AWESOME!",

After some further inquiry the waitress said she would allow us to order from the happy hour menu. We got chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer and it was mediocre at best. The tamales were good but not worth the $79 tab we incurred with an appetizer 2 drinks on happy hour and three entrees.",

This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.  Tablemates had other dishes they raved about.  Noteworthy notes:  I've not yet sat on the patio, but I can't explain why.  It looks awesome.  The margaritas are sufficiently stiff.  They're not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places.  The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and that's the only reason I'm not giving LS a 5 this time.  If you're after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride.",

It was the first spot I saw when I hopped on the road from the hotel so I figured I'd give it a shot. Upon checking out the menu, the Tijuana donkey (instead of Moscow mule) jumped out at me. Turned out they were dangerously delicious. I wanted something light so I asked about the two seafood dishes. The bartender told me he doesn't do seafood. Undeterred I went for the snapper. It was just delicious.   Based on that experience, I decided to head back again later in the week. Unfortunately, it turned out to be like reconnecting with that hot girl you had a date with years ago - it didn't quite live up to that memory. The mahi dish was meh at best, and the tortilla soup was just ok as well, lacking flavor.   I'm really not sure what to make of the place. I'm going to split the difference and go with three stars.",

Knowing the owner was associated with the owner of Elote Cafe, a restaurant we love in Sedona we came in with a hungry stomach and high expectations, only to be pretty disappointed. The salsa was okay, it was served in a chipped bowl which is not very professional. The guacamole was actually very good, the best part of the meal. I got the tacos and my husband got the chile relleno. While he enjoyed them, they were still mediocre and so were my tacos, at least For the price. They were not very good. I expected more freshness and spice, and they were very bland.   Service was okay. Got what we needed but we didn't have a knowledgable server who was able to describe dishes and make recommendations, he merely took the order and delivered the food.   I honestly wouldn't go back, not for the price and the quality.",

    "text": "Charming little place, not very crowded and has a DELIGHTFUL large patio area.  A friend and I came here after a morning with our children at the Desert Botanical Garden, hungry and tired.  CONS: Only one person seemed to be working (around 2pm) and we had to wait to be seated and then for menus.  There wasn't a lot of menu options, especially for kids.  Slow service,   No chips and salsa unless you order it (even though the meals were really small).  Kind of pricey $10-$12 for 2 or 3 tacos and beans OR rice.  The kids meals were teeny tiny, and my daughter never usually finishes any of them.  She could have eaten 3 of the quesadillas, they were so small.  Good thing they were like $1.50 or $2.  They got the order wrong, I ordered beans and rice came.  When I got the server's attention and told him, he brought the beans right away.  PROS:  The food was delicious and unique, like nothing I'd ever had before.  I ordered the seafood tacos and they were great!  My daughter liked her quesadilla.  We felt welcome on the patio, even though we stayed for like 3 hours visiting.  Later when we were the only ones there, they didn't mind that our kids went and sat up at a high table by the bar and talked (but they were well behaved).  They were friendly and the place was charming and well kept.  Kids prices were great, but you might need to order 2.  I would love to come back soon but this time I'll order the chips and salsa.",

    "text": "Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.    We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.    My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named \"Best Mole\" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sauteed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!    Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!     Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.",

Tasty pork on authentic tortillas  with pieces of pineapple.  My buddies got carnitas and chicken tacos, which they loved.",

Was greeted by a friendly host and given chips and salsa promptly (always a plus in my book) upon arrival.   I wasn't super hungry so I had the huitlacoche crepes - it was smaller than I thought it'd be but still delicious and full of flavor. I love creative cooking in South Scottsdale because you don't find it often.   On the menu they boast making the best margarita you'll ever have - those are pretty high standards to set, but I can honestly say it was one of the best margaritas I've had. I can't wait to try their cilantro liquor cocktail next time I'm in.   Jaritza was our server and she was super friendly, prompt, and attentive. I enjoyed the atmosphere and will definitely be back again!",

My husband did not care for his chicken tacos because he thought the meat was a little tough, but mine was fine. Manager offered another entree but he ended up sharing mine. No dessert but wish I would have had room for it. Eat outside of you can, looked very charming.  We will back again on a warmer night, they are doing a really nice job.",

There are a few standouts on the menu ... the smoked chicken enchilada is exquisite ... the huitlacoche quesadilla appetizer is crispy and cheesy and awesome ... and you haven't LIVED until you've had their queso fundido ... with cinnamon.

The complementary chips and two kinds of salsa were delicious. I had the chicken tamale which was exceptionally well seasoned with a smokey taste that is unusual in Mexican food. Everyone in our party was thrilled with their dining choice. The accompanying house margaritas were also good.

He ordered us the fresh made guacamole, the queso fundido and the carnitas tacos.  We had $2 dos XX pints.   The guac was pretty good, topped off with pico de gallo and served with chips and one type of salsa.  The queso fundido was whole beans covered in a white cheese; it was pretty good.  The carnitas tacos were very good, served on small fried tortillas topped with cabbage, pico, and a radish slice.   I loved the pin wheel \"chicarone\" snacky chip that was mixed in with the tortilla chips. The bartender, Arturo took care of us, was friendly and attentive, but not overly so.  5 of us ate for like $35 bucks!  Hooray late night menu!",

    "text": "Thank you, it's good to be back!    I hadn't been to LS in a few years since I don't find myself in that part of town often so I was excited to pick up the Groupon and head back.  After a  not-so-hot Mexican food experience with a friend I wanted to show him what I like.  And now he likes!  We got there around 8:30pm on a Sat nite and it was still packed inside so we sat outside since it felt reasonable with the misters.  We each had a Cadillac margarita, eh, was on the plain side.  The chips and salsa were tasty, one roasted tomatillo and the other a chunky tomato with peppers.  Neither overly hot but nice roasted flavors and spices, tasted freshly made.  We decided to have an appetizer dinner and went with the crab & mango salad, fish tacos and corn souffle with mole.  The salad was surprisingly filling and had nice, fresh flavors, the fish tacos were really tasty - just enough spice on the fish with a slice of radish, avocado and a little shot of crema.  The corn souffle was our favorite, we thought it was a nice idea.  The mole was nicely developed and went well with the corn souffle, although I think it would've been even better with some peppers in the souffle to add a little more heat against the sweet of the corn and mole.  Yes LS is on the pricey and more gourmet side.  If you're interested in nice flavors and interesting plays with Mexican food with quality ingredients then you'd probably like it.  If you're looking to consume mass quantities of cheesy-Mex and not so much savor it then its not for you.  The menu isn't overloaded, but it all looks pretty well planned and sounds tasty to me!",

Our last visit was over the top disappointing-I ordered the crab mango salad which comes plated in a high mold. I tasted it before I broke open the mold an it tasted weird so I broke it open and a fowl smell hit our party's noses that clearly indicated that the crab had gone south. We asked the waiter to take it away and he came back to show us the can it came in? Okay. I know that can happen but if it does, the manager or owner should have come and something extra done, don't you think? It was taken off the bill. period. I had some of my husband's entree because I didn't want to slow down the rest of the meal. My brother ordered a chicken dish and got enchiladas instead, by the time he had several bites and realized it-we were over it- What happened Los Sombreros?",

The guacamole was thick and creamy with fresh avocado.  The onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and lime juice were blended well together for a a creamy and thick guacamole that was still fresh and bright in flavor.  The chips were sturdy enough for scooping while being thin enough that they were not overfilling.  One of the better guacamoles that I have had in awhile.  The seafood taco appetizer was excellent.  The soft tortilla was evenly made without a doughy taste or feel.  The ceviche filling had a great citrus taste without it overpowering the minced seafood and other ingredients.  There were no harsh onion notes.  Great appetizer, but a bit on the small side if you were thinking of making a meal of it.  Not sure what the entree looks like (just more of them or larger ones).  The carnitas were sumptuous.  They are slowly braised in oil leading to a soft and tender carnitas rather then a roast one.  While I do enjoy a good roasted carnitas with a good maillard reaction and crust this method was also very good.  Although it is slowly cooked in oil the carnitas were still had a strong pork flavor that shone through.  It was not overly oily or greasy.  I also partook of a mezcal that was on the menu, the particular one I had was recommended by my waiter.  It is a cousin to tequila but not cheap stuff from college.  It is served with an orange and spiced salt but the drink itself comes neat.  It had a wonderful smokey flavor to it with a great depth of flavor that made a wonderful complement to my meal.  All in all I would return to Los Sombreros if I am in the Scottsdale or Phoenix area.",

Because the food has tons of flavor, the Marg's and Cerveza are tasty and ice cold and above all, I can repeat the prior words over and over for the past 7 years that I've been going here!  BP",

Then had the chiles rellenos and the chicken enchiladas. Fresh, delicious and all prepared with a real homemade feel. Barely had room but made space for the plain flan which was a delight as well. Overall a great meal.",

    "text": "I had two experiences with Los Sombreros .... One dining and one trying to get a reservation for a large party. My future in-laws were trying to decide on a place to make a reservation for about 20 people for dinner two nights before my fiance's and mine wedding.  They sent us on a mission to try out Old Tortilla Factory and Carlsbad Tavern.  We knew the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern, knew it wasn't what they were looking for, and found Los Sombreros on yelp.  They had good reviews and what looked like a very cozy atmosphere on the patio so we gave it a try.  We tried both restaurants and could not express how much better Los Sombreros was, the atmosphere, the food, the service .... hands down, we wanted them to book the dinner reservation here.  Well that's where my five-star review is a one-star review and I felt the experience trying to book the reservation outweighed the dinner service so they now have a one-star review.  My in-laws called them, spoke to Miriam and requested to reserve the patio for the night in question (mind you, this was about 6 weeks out so we were giving them plenty of time .... they said the more time we could give them, the better it was for them).  Miriam took the reservation but needed a credit card to hold the spot.  My in-laws thought that was weird but gave it to them anyway.  There were a few questions that she couldn't answer so requested their contact information to have her manager Jesus call them back the next day. No one ever called them back so two nights later they called again and reached Umberto.  They explained what had happened and that no one called them back and requested to speak to a manager. Umberto asked how he could help so my in-laws thought they were speaking to a manager and proceeded to tell him that they spoke to Miriam but because no one had ever called them back, they wanted to cancel the reservation.  When my in-laws said they were going to cancel the reservation, Umberto said \"well we already have your credit card number\".  My in-laws had to cancel their credit card number because they were afraid they would be charged for the reservation of 20 people anyway! How can you ever recommend a restaurant that you're trying to give them a party of 20 people on a normally not too busy night (Thursday night) and they still threaten to charge your credit card because they have the number? We will never go back and I definitely can't recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "I visited Los Sombreros with family in December.  We entered the strikingly small restaurant through a charming patio adjacent to the parking lot.  We were coldly received as we encountered three employees during our walk from the entrance, past the kitchen and bar to our table as not one of them made eye contact, let alone cracked a smile.  Our server was polite yet I felt a bit rushed to both order and eat.  I ordered limeade to drink and saw noted on the menu that one refill is included.  Although I sat with an empty glass for the latter portion of my meal, the server never attempted to provide my refill.  Also, when one member of our party was finished eating, she cleared his plate from the table and proceeded to also remove items that others were still using.  We all agreed that the food was enjoyable, although I would have preferred it to be warmer in temperature.  Finally, I was especially dissatisfied to learn that we were charged automatic gratuity for four adults and 1 child.  After experiencing the icy, hurried service, tightly cramped dining area and expensive prices, the imposition of the unearned auto gratuity was the final straw.  Mouth-wateringly delicious Mexican food served for reasonable prices in a warm environment is too easy to come by to return to Los Sombreros in the near future.",

After a several year hiatus we returned and came back looking forward to another great meal. Unfortunately, it was only so so. From reading the reviews, evidently the husband/wife team here have divorced and the wife now runs this location while the husband has opened a new place in Sedona. We ate on the patio as always and both had the snapper fish dish. Previously it was a whole fish, now just a filet and nothing special. The chips, two salsas and guacamole wee great, everything else just OK. This restaurant always seemed to be a great example of authentic Mexican cuisine, now that best thing I can say about it is that's it's better that the national chains. Next visit I'll be exploring other Mexican restaurants in the area and hoping that Los Sombreros will return to its formal glory. Will also try the husbands place in Sedona to see what he's up to.",

Sometimes the service is a little slow on the first contact, but once you order the food comes pretty quickly--and it's good! I've been here 5 or 6 times and always leave with leftovers--large portions in general are served! The margaritas are so-so in my opinion, but they have a huge tequila selection and lots of mescal. The best things on the menu? The lamb is delicious but better for you spice lovers; carnitas are superb; yummy chunky guacamole (although this could probably come in a bigger bowl); huitlacoche crepas; and lots of their specials (i had really good duck tacos once! unfortunately i have yet to see it on the specials again). I took my parents, including my dad who needs perfect service, here and they both enjoyed it.   Pros: outdoor seating           delicious food  Mediocre: margaritas  Cons: wait till first service",

    "text": "Los sombreros was absolutely dreadful talk about serving dog food the tacos I had a unique shell they were way to over cooked to where my taco evaporated before I could lift it to my mouth , the salsa was terrible the lighter one they served you tasted like there was lemon and vinegar in it , and the second bowl of salsa had way to much garlic to start and slowly starts to taste like your average Sunday BBQ sauce I dont even want to get started on the other two meals... But then we ask for a plan cheese crisp with no garnish , when it comes back it had pico and sauce, the chef said they were trying something new , and for the enchilada it tasted like pickles because the dish is served with steamy fresh pickles and zucchini , carrots, broccoli, and cucumbers. what i see in the chefs presentation in his/her dishes is that they are going through a mid life crisis to save there restaurant I've only seen this in kitchen nightmares but never have been to a restaurant thats on the waiting list for that show . I do not recommend eating here unless you want to spend your life savings on crap",

When you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken. Once I opened the menu, I could not believe it. I think the cheapest dinner item was over $16. I tried the carnitas, a Mexican staple and something I usually enjoy. Not this time. In one word BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. No salt. No pepper. No lime. Nothing at all to make this meat taste decent. It was tender, I will give them that, but it was more like jello than pork. The texture was pretty gross. We also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas. Who the hell does not serve tortillas WITH their carnitas? Seriously....  The black beans were okay, the only part of the meal I could actually stomach. The rice was crunchy and bland. The salsa was bland and watery. Also, no refills on the salsa... Cheap bastards charge me over $16 for BLAND CRAP and cannot even fill up my salsa for free?  The service was bad, slow and aloof.   I would rather eat at one of the \"bertos\" instead of this crap hole. Honestly, save yourself the money and find another Mexican joint. I am in shock that this place has customers.  Not even deserving of one star. That bad.",

    "text": "It had been many years since we had been to Los Sombreros, as we usually end up at Frank and Lupes's if we are this close to Old Town. Now, the first issue is the style of the food: some people do not consider ANY kind of Mexican food to be \"gourmet\" or worth any combo plate being more than $8.95.I grew up on Mexican food, and it's changed to include other areas of Mexico - the seafood of the Yucatan, the European influence of Oaxaca. It's not \"fusion\"....it's all Mexico, but most of us have had limited exposure to what Mexican food can really do! We arrived early on a Saturday and settled in on the patio - prettier than I remember and furnished nicely. We were immediately welcomed and escorted to a table. They could really use a guitarist on nice evenings. We ordered the Huitlacoche Crepas after I read the reviews here on Yelp. They were in-cred-i-ble with the earthiness of the mushroom-like fungus (sorry, I couldn't come up with a better word), the sweetness of the corn, and the compatible contrast of the cheese and a drizzle of pomagranet sauce. I don't know why a previous reviewer posted regarding the crepes being too sweet, as the sauce was not overly plentiful, and I would not have liked the dish to be swimming in the sweet sauce either. My husband had the carnitas which were wonderfully lean and smoky. However, when he tasted my Smoked Chicken Enchiladas, he absolutely rolled his eyes in ecstasy. Normally, I might have avoided a Tomatillo sauce, as it can be too bright and citrus-y, but this was just a blend of flavors that made me utter continual \"Mmmmmmmm's\" with every bite, and although I could have finished the plate, I left just enough to enjoy for a small lunch the next day. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!! With drinks (3), appetizer, 2 Entrees, tip - the bill was about $100, and worth it. We will be back soon. 2nd review - April, 2012  - I have removed a star. The hostess was rude, seating on the front patio is horrendous.....noise, the smell of the street, and the table in the corner sits at such a slant that you have to hold on to your drink. We introduced new Scottsdale residents to the restaurant that night, and they wished we had taken them back to Frank and Lupe's. So, Los Sombreros needs to prioritize consistency  - which probably isn't going to happen in such a small space",

Well at the end of the work day we were all scratching our heads about where to get dinner so I suggested we try out Los Sombreros.  We had a party of 11 people and I felt a little pressure going in just because if it was bad then I wouldn't hear the end of it.  When setting up the reservation the person on the phone was easy to deal with and he called me back after my initial call because he wasn't sure about being able to fit us in on this busy Wednesday evening .  The overall experience of Los Sombreros was exactly what I was hoping for.  We had to sit inside on because of our group size, but it was fine.  The service was good, they had two servers working our table. The margaritas with fresh lime juice were really tasty.  Guacamole was incredible.  My crab enchiladas came and wow I was in heaven, even the sides I ordered of vegetables and black beans were full of flavor.  I think EVERYONE in our group liked their dinners, so I felt pretty cool for a few minutes at least.   All in all one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had.  I live in Michigan and we don't get this kind of food up here.    One note: Not many options for vegetarians.",

Right away we were happy with the chips and salsas, and the guacamole was fresh and tasty, but dinner proved to be a mixed experience. We both had the mole poblano, which is shredded chicken in a Puebla-style mole. The mole was fantastic, with a complex and pleasing flavor. The chicken, however, was inconsistent between our two plates. About 90 percent of my chicken was dry; my husband had more moist than dry chicken on his plate. I was disappointed, especially given the cost ($18.95), but the mole sauce helped the dryness, and then there was that lovely, fluffy rice, and the wonderfully creamy refried beans. I'm thinking the dry chicken was due to an off night, but I can't say I'm in a rush to go back. There are too many other good Mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix.",

    "text": "I have been dying to come to this place for several years, but just didn't get around to it.  I met the original owner/chef years ago on the way to Mexico City and since then I wanted to visit the restaurant.  Well thanks to Groupon, it was the final motivation to my butt in there.  First off, I don't truly classify this restaurant as \"mexican\" food as most people know it.  The food is much more complex than typical mexican food and thats the part I love about it.  I was there on a Tuesday evening around 5pm.  The place was already busy inside, but I was never greeted at the entrance by anyone.  I simply walked in, looked around and found more comfort at the bar outside.  The bartender was young, new and not really experienced enough to give me great insight into the menu selections, but that was ok, he was new to the place.  I observed the level of service throughout and service or greeting of people arriving at the restaurant was almost an after thought. But hey, Groupon was expiring and they were getting busy.  It seemed to catch them off guard.    Chips and Salsa were very good and both salsas had excellent, mild flavor, but didn't over power anything.  You could truly enjoy the taste of the salsa.  I wasn't sure if there were nopales in the salsa, so I asked, but didn't get an answer.  I next ordered the Huitlacoche crepas (9.95), they were very good, slightly sweet with plenty of cheese in the crepe and topped with a ample amount of pomegranate.  It was good, but I would not order it again, more because of the sweetness of it, rather than the creation itself.  It was well presented and very tasty.  My meal was brought to me shortly after the arrival of the appetizer, consequently my meal was returned, and later brought back, but not quite as hot.  But it was DELICIOUS.  The Lamb Adobo is certainly an item not to be missed.   It was tender and juicy, ample amount of food and the Adobo (Ancho chilie sauce ))was extremely good.   I had it with a side of rice and beans, although the portions of both were smaller than I would have expected.  The Lamb Adobo is clearly a winner on their menu, and is the motivating factor to return and try other unique and delicious dinners.    I waited for a check for more than 20 minutes and then once the credit card was placed, it took another 10 minutes to notice it.  They were busy, I'll give them that.  However with the food as great as it is, I would hope that service levels could be escalated.  Simple things such as recognizing you when you enter the building even to say \"we'll be right with you\" is all it takes.  Checking on you after you have your meal are basic service elements that can use improvement at this establishment.  For my first, much anticipated visit, I was relatively disappointed only in the service levels, but certainly not the food.  The food is delciouis and I will be back.",

It had pretty good reviews and a friend of our recommended it for a late night happy hour.    To begin our waiter was a snob, he acted like we were lucky to have him, and at one point he actually rolled his eyes at us... seriously.   The guacamole looked fantastic coming out of the kitchen, so we started with that.  It was good, but it and the chips needed salt and there was none on the table.   The menu was not vegetarian friendly unless I wanted to order an appetizer salad.  They had a special on the board called \"Mushroom Quesadillas\", so I asked the server what was in them... trying to make sure it had no meat.  He said basically mushrooms and cheese.  So I ordered those.  What I got was  essentially a mushroom and cheese tamale deep fried, No tortilla! It was okay, but I would never have ordered it if I knew what it was... which was why I asked.   Getting anything out of our server was like pulling teeth.   The only reason I gave this place a 3 instead of a 2 was the chocolate cream pie dessert.  I think we may try it again for a reverse happy hour if someone invited us, but the prices were a little high for the food quality and service.",

Both were excellent in taste and size. Prices are a little high, but if you want cheap, Super Burrito is across the street. Great looking place and patio. Service from bartender was friendly.",

I was very satisfied and would come back here again.",

    "text": "My wife and I have eaten here for many years and loved it.  The last couple times were not so good and last night (9/25/10) was awful.  The margarita was weak tasting and half way through it, it was like bad water - all for $8.50.  They have also changed the salsa and we don't think it was very flavorful.  We had the tomato and cheese appetizer, which was very tasty but the salt level was extremely high.  My wife ordered the chicken mole and I ordered the pork dish in green sauce (not the carnitas).  We do not typically send food back but my wife's chicken was very tough.  They brought a second dish, which was more tender - this leads me to believe the first chicken was either leftover or burnt and they just covered it in sauce and served it.  My pork and the sauce it was in was tasty but over half the pork was either solid fat or grisly meat.  I happen to like leaner cuts.  We ate at the bar and watched the bartender make the margarita mix in a bucket.  After making the mix, he poured an awful lot of water on top of it.  No wonder our $8.50 drinks were so watery.  We have been told the owner does not allow the wait staff to come in until 15 minutes before opening - likely to save costs.  Unfortunately, the cost cutting has also affected the food and drink quality.  Sorry - this restaurant is off our list permanently.",

    "text": "Had dinner there for the first time since my original review. I told my husband, it's probably been a good 10 years since we've been here.\" Turns out it was 10 years to the day in fact! I was actually much more impressed this time around I'm happy to report.  First, no more ordering chips. They are complimentary. We did order guacamole (delicious) and ceviche. The ceviche was excellent. Very fresh, veggies still had a nice bite to them. A little on the spicy side, but not excessive.  Remembering the food used to be on the hot side, I ordered the ribeye tacos. Perfection. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly tender, perfectly simple dish. I did substitute one of the beef tacos for a seafood one. It was good, but I wanted a little more from it. I thought it was slightly bland. I also sampled my husband's refried beans and rice. I'm picky about beans and LOVED them. The rice needed salt badly. For dessert, I went with the chocolate cream pie. It was \"stiffer\" than I expected, in a good way. Much better than a typical cream pie. A mountain of chocolate! I did think it needed a little more fruit on the side or something to cut the richness a bit.  Service was excellent, especially given it was a busy night. One of the owners stopped by and it turns out, he grew up in the neighborhood. I love that! The new ownership is definitely doing justice to this gem.   If I could make one teeny suggestion, it would be with regard to seating. At the point we arrived, there were quite a few empty tables, yet we were seated right next to a large party. Not knowing how they assign reserved tables (ours was a last minute reservation), we didn't request a different table. However, I prefer when restaurants space out diners, filling in the space as the restaurant gets busy. To me it's odd to sit right next to other diners when the area is largely empty.  Thank you to Los Sombreros for a wonderful dinner. Now that we live in the neighborhood, we'll definitely be back soon...not in 10 years! After Easter...we gave up eating out for lent...I don't know why...I'm not even Catholic. Stupid move on my end.",

The taco options are very creative and tough to choose from... too bad they don't come with rice and beans with such a high price of $12 for 3 small steak tacos.... that was my only issue.   Great salsa with nice thin and warm chips... classic!   The place was much smaller than I imagined so I would assume on a busier night, a reservation would be smart.   Overall good night and would come back!",

More times I have returned and all times their food has been exquisite!!! I'm vegetarian and there are options for everyone- Mexican food by nature it's not meat oriented. You will not find yellow cheese or piles of lettuce on the plates, but rather yummy Mexican red rice, beans that taste like home, fresh salsas and warm chips- and not the usual tomato hot sauce, prepare  yourself for roasted chilies and invested time of wonderful ingredients. Try the jicama-orange salad... refreshing and crunchy. Their crab salad, very fulfilling and fresh. One of my companions tried the soft tacos de carnitas- juicy, meaty, savory and like being on Mexico. Portions are very generous and healthy plated. Make space for dessert... piloncillo ice cream has Mexican cinnamon hint, flan? (Now I know where I can have a flan as great as mine) Go with time to seat, enjoy and relax. Food is fresh and perfectly seasoned. Service? The best!!! Since you approach the entrance until you leave. Very harmonious and lovely place! Salud Adan- and other owners. You guys are doing justice to Mexican food. Thank you and your team for what you're doing!",

This is a really cute place, nice atmosphere, cute patio, and the staff is pretty friendly. The owner came around to all the tables to say hello, which I why I'm not doing one star.  First experience: they sat us at a table that sat four people, we ordered an appetizer and a drink, and then they asked to move us because they had a party of four coming in that wanted to sit there. They apologized and comped our appetizer but that felt pretty crappy. Food wasn't on par.  Second experience: dirty table, slow greeting, warm beer due to frozen keg and they brought it out anyway instead of letting us know so we could change our order (they comped it... Ya thanks for the free warm beer), and finally the server decided to tell us when our food should have been coming out (about twenty minutes) that they were out of an ingredient for what I ordered, so I had to order something else which they brought out right away but told me they just happened to have an extra plate (it had been sitting in the window for a few minutes).... Just. Not. Happy. With that kind of inconvenience, that should have been comped, but instead they charged $12+ for three tacos and no sides.  Not coming back again.",

We've always had a good time and a good meal here. However, we've only ever eaten dinner/happy hour here.  Our favorite is the Puerco en Chipotle. It's basically a huge portion of slow roasted and extra juicy pork in a chipotle sauce with Oaxaca cheese on top. Oh my god. This just melts in your mouth. The flavors are so good together. I just wish it had more cheese!   My husband has had the Lamb adobo before, which is a lamb shank in a spicy sauce. Again, this is really tender and flavorful.   I've had the smoked chicken enchilada dinners several times here and they are consistently good. The chicken is flavorful and blends well with the chipotle crema.   For happy hour we've had the grilled ribeye steak tacos, guacamole, and well margaritas. Everything was good, but the steak wasn't as tender as the other meats we've had here and probably wouldn't order again.   For dessert, they have rotating flan flavors. The traditional flan is my husband's favorite, but mine is the Bailey's/Kahlua flan. Oooh, oh so good. This is a great way to end the night.",

Hmmm... interesting... They re-opened about a week ago so I decided to check things out.  What a difference! The updated place was busy, we were promptly greeted and sat by a very sweet and friendly employee. The vibe was upbeat and happy. The place still has it's unique charm but better-squeaky CLEAN with a better table layout and the place is spruced up a bit. The food was phenomenal- even better than I remembered. (my seafood crepes were great, but the chipotle pork.. ohmigod)  Yolanda took care of us and gave us great recommendations... when I shared how happy we were compared to our previous experiences she even introduced us to Jeff one of the new owners who shared their history and connections to South Scottsdale. It was great and I could not be happier that Los Sombreros has been revived!  We will be back again and again.",

    "text": "I purchased a coupon, this was my first time there and I went for lunch with a friend who had also never been.  It is a very nice atmosphere and more upscale than I was expecting.  We were taken to tall tables just off the bar.  I only saw one other couple in there and they were in another room with lots of windows.  The bar area is a bit dark but very nice. Our waiter brought us their drink menu and dinner menu.  Since I'd just been on their website I knew they had a lunch menu with $9.95 specials.  Even though we were there at 12:30 pm we had to specifically ask for their lunch menu.  This was red-flag #1.  My friend wanted one of those special margaritas whereas I asked for \"just a plane old margarita.\"  The waiter said \"so you want the 'house' margarita'\" and walked away.  Both margaritas were very good, my friend was particularly pleased with his.  Mine was a little fancy for my taste.  He ordered the Chicken Enchilada and really liked it.  I ordered Chile Relleno, and while it was prepared very well, it wasn't like any Chile Relleno I'd ever had before.  It had a sweet taste to it and was very rich.  While I believe many would really enjoy the way they prepared, I wouldn't order it again.  I'm much more of a plane-Jane sort of guy.  When the bill came we were charged for two of the special margaritas my friend had ordered ($10/each).  We asked about it and the waiter said \"that's just the way it comes up on the register; they're both the same price so it doesn't matter.\"  I wanted to know how a plane old margarita could be the same price as a \"special\" margarita and he explained that he'd brought me a \"house\" margarita, not a \"well\" margarita.  I guess a \"well\" margarita was what I thought my vocabulary was asking for but somehow things got confused in the translation.  This was red-flag #2. My friend will most definitely go back and take his wife.  He knows margaritas and prides himself in making them himself and immediately knew theirs were made with fresh lemons.  The waiter confirmed this.  While I wouldn't avoid this place, and even though they have very good food, drinks, and atmosphere, I'm the sort of person that is put-off by multiple red-flags.  Red-flags in this instance translate to \"not total honesty.\"",

The food is very much like what I have eaten in Mexico City, D.F. down through Guatemala and Honduras - so it is not your typical Sonoran style Mexican food so often served in Phoenix.  I had the potato tacos - really small, but absolutely totally filling and tasty.  Their salsas are different than anything I have tried at other restaurants - very pleasant taste, and not too hot.  Everything is made 100% from scratch, so that makes the higher prices worth it, in my opinion.  Service was excellent.",

Los Sombreros costs a few dollars more than maybe it should, but the portions were large, fresh and served with lovely presentation. I had enchiladas with hibiscus, which tastes like a sweet jam.

The hotter of the two has a very strong chipotle flavor, which I love, but for those who don't the other one was just as good. The weird little pinwheel wheat things they give you with the chips are not my cup of tea, but just about everything else is. I think the spot is totally quaint and charming, and the servers are always accommodating. I'm vegan and started disecting the menu when the waitress asked if I was vegan, and I am, she suggested I get the chef's special vegan dish- rarely does that happen! It was amazing, the sauce was incredible, the potatoes mushrooms and corn were cooked to perfection and I appreciated the extra veggies and avocado.

Overall it was way way overrated and overpriced. When you walk in to get seated you have to walk through the bowels of the kitchen - not a nice first impression. The staff was friendly and the dining room ambience was nice. The guacamole was very good, but it better be for $10!! My mojito was good as well, but again, $10 is a bit much for a small drink. That's all the positives I have to say about the food. My husband ordered the ribeye steak tacos and they were all fat. He suffered through them because we were with a group of 8 and didn't want to complain. Another person in our group didn't get their food until about 20 min. after the rest fo the table because the waitor had mistakenly left it off the order. We ended up sitting there with our food getting cold because we didn't feel comfortable eating in front of our foodless friend. We were surprised that they didn't comp his meal or do anything to make it right. We didn't say anything - but they really should given him something for the long delay. I ordered the Camarones con tequila al ajillo which was recommended to me by the waitor. The presentation was nice, but the portion was tiny (for $20.95) and the food was tasteless and it was full of huge strips of fatty bacon. I hope you love corn tortillas, because they don't even offer flour! My son ordered a kids quesadilla and I had them add chicken to it (it was just plain cheese on the menu). They charged me an extra $4 for about 2 tblsp. of chicken. His entire meal was one corn tortilla folded in half - no sides. He is 7 and was still starving when he finished. The quesadilla at Taco Bell is better. They also snuck a $3 charge to our bill for a tiny side of sour cream for my son. So a \"snack\" for my son ended up costing us $9! We would never recommend this place or visit again. Not my idea of a $70 night out!",

I've been a big fan of Los Sombreros since I first went to it when it was located in the strip mall by the Big Lots.  There was absolutely nothing I could complain about there - not Tex Mex, but real Mexican food.  The salsa is smoky and five star.  I am personally a fan of battery-acid hot food and they had a habanaro salsa that was, well, YIKES and YUM at the same time.  The guacamole is one of the best I've ever had and the seafood tacos appetizer is something I absolutely love and think of often made with crema - not Americanized sour cream.   They are amazing.  I also am in love with the crab enchiladas and the puerco en mole verde.  My husband - a definite mole afcionado, loves their mole poblano and rates it second to none.  Margaritas are very good and the chocolate tamal with that carmel sauce and ice cream....wow.  I have taken four different people here on different occasions and all of them agreed it was sublime.",

    "text": "Los Sombreros is the best authentic Mexican food in the valley.  That is a bold statement, especially with offerings like Barrio Cafe, but the attention to detail, authenticity and one of the coziest patios around makes Los my favorite Mexican spot. We have been several times and always order the same thing so this time around we thought we would try one of the new items on the menu.  I am so glad we did. We started with the crepes appetizer and the fig & panela salad. The crepes were amazing. They were filled with goat & blue cheese and had a delicious pomegranate sauce on top. The salad with figs had a honey lime dressing that was divine.  My husband usually gets the seafood crepes but had the Ribeye instead.  He was totally obsessed! He loved that it was covered with a chipotle and pineapple salsa. And of course every time we go we have to get their tasty margaritas and the chips and guacamole. You can't go wrong with those!",

    "text": "We ventured up Scottsdale Road on Monday night because my inlaws wanted to take us out for dinner and they wanted Mexican. The sign for the restaurant out front is not that big, so definitely pay attention. The patio is really cute, but we opted to sit inside. Inside is small and cozy with exposed brick. I felt instantly at home.  My mother-in-law and I had the House Special margaritas which we both liked, although I have to say that the margaritas my mother-in-law makes at home are way better. For appetizer, we tried the queso fundido with crab which we all loved. Nice pieces of lump crabmeat and a nice manageable size for an appetizer. For dinner, I had the chicken tacos which were delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it in the tacos. Even though it's listed as an appetizer, it was more than enough food for me for dinner especially after eating the queso fundido. My mother-in-law had the goat cheese and blue cheese crepes with pomegranate sauce; I snagged a bite...delicious! My father-in-law had the seafood tacos which he really liked (I didn't get to sample them). My husband had the crab enchiladas which I also snagged a bite of...they were good and the tomato chipotle sauce gave the dish a nice kick. We did however both taste a bit of shell which was unfortunate.  Our server was really nice and paid just the right amount of attention to us. I didn't get a chance to see the final bill since my father-in-law was paying, but the prices were very reasonable considering the amount of food you received. I think the most expensive entree I saw was about $20 which includes two sides. Definitely a place we will return to especially when it's nice out to sit on the patio.",

Just south of Thomas Los Sombreros has been providing its patrons with stiff, sweet, and ohh so salty Patron Margaritas since its founding and its a great place to stop at the bar for a quick drink a some tasty guacamole.  A little pricey for a Mexican restaurant and the service can be a little suspect but in the end definitely one of the best authentic restaurants in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I could not agree more with Alicia B's review. I went here with my husband Saturday night, it is in our nieghboorhood and we had heard decent things. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, not because it was full or busy. The hostess looked a right at us, no acknowledgement and then she went on to what must have been more important business. Finally, a passing waiter sat us. The service continued to be inattentive and slow. Our cocktails were tasty, I had a pomegranire margarita and my husband has something with a kooky name, I think it mentioned a Donkey. We had the Queso with crab which was pretty good, the crab could have been tastier and the whole thing needed some spice. The chips and salsa, OK. I had the carnitas, after recommendation by our waitress. Not bad, but certainly not good and not worth $17. My Husband has the seafood crepes, they were OK, but lacking flavor. The food was not bland, but flat, just meh. This place would be a 3 star, but for the price, it is coming down to a 2 star.  The building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere, too bad the food and service don't follow suit.   On a side note I did get to overhear a great conversation by two guys visiting from out of town, probably in thier mid to late 40s. I guess last time they came here the women were way hotter. This time there are hot women, but they are not as common. They seemed to like the place, one of them remarked the only thing better than his food was getting laid earlier that day.",

    "text": "We tried to get here for the 10 course tasting meal before the end of the month. Since we live 15 miles away we called on Friday at 5 to see if we could make a reservation before driving all the way there. Their policy in general about reservations is to not take any except for parties of 5 or more and it applied to the special dinner as well. I asked if there was any problem getting in that evening. \"No problem, come on in.\" We left right away and got there a little after 5:30. Well, there were problems. First was parking. There is limited on site parking, all taken. There is street parking on Virginia Street and extending into the neighboring residential area, all taken. There was parking across the street but that was clearly marked as reserved for the business in that location. I waited in the car for ten minutes for a spot while my wife went in to see what the situation was and to get a table, if possible. After ten minutes a spot opened up in the parking lot but before I could back up and take it, someone else arrived and slipped into the spot right in front of me. Maybe they are regulars and know that when it comes to parking courtesy goes by the wayside. Frustrated I left the car in the middle of the lot and went in to see what was happening to my wife. She had stood for a few minutes at the entry before someone acknowledged her presence. She asked about a table for two and was told, with a wave of the arm, to take a seat anywhere on the left in the dining area and then that person walked away. And that is where she was sitting when I found her. She had not seen a waiter or received a menu. I wondered how long someone would have to wait before the staff realized they had a customer. At that point we left. What does this place need? Better parking, a reservation system at least for peak hours, and attentive staff. The food might be good but we wouldn't know.",

My expectation and hope is an evening with great company, food, and service. Great company I can handle, great food Los Sombreros has covered...but the service makes me wince. The owner is the first person to greet you at the door and she is abrasive and has been rude (kinda sets the tone, it's her place after all). Not once, not twice, but several times. I try and support businesses that value and appreciate their clients, especially in this financial climate. So my compromise is take-out. We only (rarely) order take-out and on the condition my husband picks it up so I dont have to be reminded why we no longer eat there. Christmas tamales are to die for.",

Quesadillas are not the type that you would find at say, a Chili's -- two large flour tortillas with some cheese in the middle.  They're made of fresh masa and are stuffed with rajas, and are more akin to fried turnovers than your standard Americanized quesadilla.  Other than the quesadillas, we ordered the mole verde and seafood tacos, both of which were excellent.  The chips came with two types of salsa.  I was a huge fan of the chunkier spicier one.  Even the veggies were good -- not the standard onion and pepper mix, and perfectly cooked.",

It was a bit crazy and busy,  so we got some margaritas at the bar while we waited  for a table. The margaritas were delicious- we each tried a few different ones, and all of them were delicious. As we began our meal we started off with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The guac was delicious and fresh, however I could have used a little more spice in the salsa. Also I was a little taken aback by the wagon wheel chips but after a bite or two, I could see why some people may enjoy them.  My one major gripe about this place was the fact that it seemed like our waitress disappeared for a bit. We had finished chips and salsa and our first round of drinks before she came back to take our dinner orders. I had the crab enchiladas. They were amazing. I also tried a bite of my dads seafood crepes, and now I know next time what I will be getting. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, and we took leftovers home, which were just as delicious. I would definitely like to go here again, but hopefully with better service. I would eat here again.",

But other than those perks, there is nothing really impressive about it. I went once for a few months ago, right after receiving a mailer announcing new management. Nothing stood out then, but I decided to give it another try since they added brunch and sent a buy-one-get-one-free offer. Had a decent margarita and chips and salsa. Salsa is fine, chips are thin and crispy and seem like they might be made in-house but if they are, they should be served warm. I had the huevos rancheros with carnitas, served with roasted small potatoes. It looked so tasty but was bland and uninteresting, even once I doused some Cholula on it. We split the Mexican French toast. The different sauces drizzled on it (chocolate, caramel and pomegranate) blend together and the texture is really moist, more like bread pudding than French toast. The fresh whipped cream was a nice touch. Given how much more I like similar places - Barrio Cafe, Barrio Queen, Gallo Blanco - I do not think I would pick this place again.",

The replacement glass of water was filthy with lipstick marks all around the edge. YUK!  So we looked closer at the table & had to get the utensils replace because we were picking stuff off the surfaces. We should have left immediately but had already placed our orders. The salsa is very good but it was downhill after that.  I have NEVER had a chili rellenos dish served in a bowl, floating in enough liquid to call it a soup. The flavor was good but the entire dish was a soggy mess. Because of these things, I can barely give them 1 star & would never recommend them to anyone.",

    "text": "Had the absolute WORST experience last night at this restaurant!!! They didn't have our reservation for 20-30 people and shoved us outside on a teeny tiny patio. It was very awkward, the road noise was so bad our speaker had to change the format of the entire event! But that was just the beginning! We waited for 30-40 mins to get orders taken, then another 45 for the food to arrive, the waiter was the absolute rudest I have ever encountered. I have worked in many, many restaurants and understand when things are slammed or other factors but this guy was such a jerk! During this entire time the owner knew our situation and apparently didn't care because he never came to our table to apologize or make it right. Plus there was a 20% auto gratuity added for some guy to take forever and be a jerk! The two appetizers they comped hardly made up for the horrific experience! Oh and one stall for over a hundred people doesn't seem like enough bathrooms. I will NEVER go back to this hell hole. I advise you all to do the same and stay away.",

Went to this restaurant with my family and service was crap, one lady(maybe a host or owner idk she didn't bother introduce herself) came by asked if we're okay, we asked for a high chair and she said she'd get us one(she never came back to our table). The waiter came by got our drinks order and he was not so helpful, I think he was the only waiter for the restaurant because he was running around each table. Anyways, I wanted order chicken enchiladas but it has spicy sauce on top so I asked if the cook could put the sauce on the side and his response was \"No\" so I had to rethink another entree. We asked for quesadilla for kids and if they could add chicken in it he said \"no\". The salsa was watery and not good.  After waiting and waiting and waiting we decided to get up and leave. So far the only thing that went good was our soda drinks! My guess is that everything is pre-made and that's why they couldn't put anything on side or add.  I would never recommend this restaurant. I forgot to mention OVERPRICED!!! We ended up at the Mexican food place directly across from them lol got better food excellent service and more reasonable price.",

    "text": "The Los Sombreros 10 Course Tasting Menu ($50. for TWO) is PHENOMENAL and is something you shouldn't miss out on if you are thinking of trying flavors of Central Mexico as the special will end sometime call or check website. I was told they are extending the special past August to promote the new menu and new restaurant they are opening.  You get. Chips and two Fresh Salsas.  Two cups Pozole Soup Two Hibiscus Taquitos Fig & Panela Cheese Salad Shrimp & Papaya Salad Salmon with Mango Salsa Trout with Almonds in Lemon Butter & Capers Chile Rellenos with Beef Picadillo Pechuga Rellena (Stuffed Chicken Breast in Chipotle Tomato Sauce) Pork Loin with Tamarind Mole House Made Piloncillo Ice Cream  Everything had delicious flavors.  I never had Hibiscus Taquitos before and they were a stand out. A little sweet and cheesy and tangy they were delicious.  The Chile Relleno stuffed with Beef were very unlike any other I had before being much lighter and MUCH tastier than any other I ever had. I liked that they weren't a fried battered kind like you get at most places and only had just the right touch of cheese on them.  The four entrees were all delicious but a few were over cooked but very ACCEPTABLE and that is the only reason I didn't up this place to five stars but I was five stars happy.  The house made Ice cream was very fresh tasting and the most creamy ice cream I remember trying in a while.  This place is far above average and is very good but it's a small place and many tables inside are high tops.  ***UPDATE****the chef and ownership has changed since my visit******  4.5 Stars",

Our main course was the chicken mole enchiladas aka. chicken enmoladas which I hadn't had in years and was my very first go to dish here. It is 2 enchiladas with mole sauce and cheese and it is so very good. Their mole is excellent. It came with sides of re-fried beans (which they have the best), rice and steamed vegetables.

It is a little brick house that is so warm and inviting. They have a wonderful patio with misters - yes, you guys, we actually wanted to sit outside in August! This never ever happens with me. The service was so friendly and we had a great experience.   We started with their DELICIOUS chips, salsa, and guac. The guac was so yummy and I love their chips - thin and crispy! Their salsas are also homemade and very tasty. They made me a pretty mocktail as well which paired perfectly with the munchies. Sometimes virgin margaritas can be way too sweet but not this one! It was perfect.   We both had a pretty big lunch so we were looking to have a lighter dinner, hence the salads. I ordered their tomato salad + added chicken and it was amazing! It was like a Mexican Caprese salad and the dressing was a dream. My husband ordered their fig salad (it was huge!) and he loved it. We were both super satisfied.  They also have daily specials and our server mentioned that they have incredible specials + live music on Sundays! I can't wait to bring our pup back on a cooler Sunday to hang out on their lovely patio. We'll absolutely be back soon. I'm so happy that I re-discovered this South Scottsdale gem.",

Would rather have ordered a margarita   The quesadillla appetizer (5/5)handmade thick  fried corn tortillas filled with lots of cheeses and covered in sauce! We all enjoyed this.   Shrimp and goat cheese tacos (4/5) great flavor just a little lacking, it needs some slaw or greens with it.   Al pastor tacos (5/5) great flavor on the pork and love the fresh pineapple on top.   Kids chicken enchiladas (5/5) I tried a bite and it was so delicious! Lots of shredded chicken, cheese and the sauce was perfect!

So that disconnect between what the host told us about \"Taco Tuesday\" and what we actually experienced was disappointing as we were looking forward to enjoying happy hour prices. Overall, the ambiance is very quaint and COZY to say the least. Quite a small dining room so reservations are most likely a must. We'll probably return to try some of the more expensive/higher-end meal options such as lamb or steak and perhaps sit on the lovely, lighted patio during a warmer season!",

The chips and salsa was really good! They had a smokey salsa I really enjoyed. I recommend going on Tuesday for taco Tuesday. Tacos start at $2 and they have drink specials for their house margaritas and Tecate. This place is a cozy little restaurant with a nice outdoor seating area. Everything our table ordered was pretty good but I think it's worth noting that the ceviche was $14 which seems a little steep for a small appetizer. Overall, the food and service was pretty good. I may return for another taco Tuesday  Pictured is the outside area and the carnitas tacos.",

Free chips and two excellent house made salsas kept the margarita's company.  We shared ceviche for a starter.  A unique presentation and was excellent.  Will order again.  My wife had the smoked chicken enchilada while I had the carnitas plate.  Quality was great and flavors wonderful.  Adam, the owner, spent a few minutes with us.

I had the Carnitas with my 2 choices of black beans and veggies. Meat was tender and flavorful, beans good (I liked that they were served separately in a small cup), and don't skip the veggies! They were a great combination that have a delicate grilled flavor. EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD! My husband thoroughly enjoyed his Tamale with refried beans and rice. I didn't get to taste but it was beautifully plated and he loved it. Our entrees were served with tortillas. Lots of food.  I'm sure you'll love Los Sombreros too!",

I have been here twice since the Yelp event and enjoyed both visits. You can't go wrong with chips and guac. Their salsa is a tasty chipotle. But I have to say their shrimp ceviche is probably the best I've had in a while.  I've also tried a few of their tacos and they're really good. As for drinks, I've had the Steve-a-Rita and the Cadillac, both of which I would recommend. I did try the Paloma and would not order it again but only because of the Tajin, just not my thing. Having said that, I will definitely continue visiting this establishment, as the food is great and the service is too. The drinks are wowza!",

Great fun in a small but comfy setting. They also have a really nice outdoor bar area with more seating outside than inside.  Extensive margarita menu so you will be able to either drink a classic or discover something new. Don't miss out on checking out the bathroom doors, really cool!!",

Fresh chips and salsa, not that boring tomato puree, but a nice house made chipotle salsa and hot crispy chips.   I had the ribeye, my GF had the crab enchiladas.  Rice and beans were spot on as was the guacamole.  Seasoning on my steak was nothing less than perfect, tender and flavorful, cooked slightly more than requested, but so tender and delicious, I could not fault it at all.   When I saw pecan pie on the dessert menu, I knew we had to try it, unfortunately they were out, so instead David (our amazing server) brought us hot house made churros with homemade ice cream.  Words can't describe how good that was.   We have a new favorite. Can't wait to come back and try another amazing dish.  And they take reservations!!",

Like it was the actual avocado. I am still new in Phoenix area but I bet if there is any guacamole contest they would win :)  The shrimp cocktail was amazing so delicious . I've never tried anything like that before. Amazing shrimps , everything so fresh and simply delicious.  The beef was so delicious. I think most think I love about this place is of course the delicious fresh food but also the amazing attitude of the owner and his waitress/ bartenders .   Jaritza was amazing waitress , she was smiling all the time and really took care of us. Which was a bonus , I love it when I go to a place and get amazing service . I enjoy the food much more when I see the friendly and nice waiters/waitress.  It was a long time since I was in a place that the food was delicious with a great atmosphere and wonderful attitude . Everything is just amazing. I highly suggested to go there have a drink and food :)",

To eat we had the jicama and orange salad, which my husband described as a vegan ceviche lol. Was very delicious and the Queso fundido with spinach. That was very good as well. The atmosphere is really cool too it's very comfortable and clean. Actually took us back for a moment when we were in Akumal Mexico. Definitely a new favorite of ours.

We pulled into the driveway and were impressed with the cute bar area on the back corner. It was made out of an old shipping container and had lights hung up in the trees around it.   We walked around the front, thinking the entrance was there but we ended up walking back to the back, and actually had to go through the back patio seating and through the kitchen, which was odd.   As we were waiting to be seated we were talking about it, and how it was our first time here, and as we walked to our table multiple servers asked us about it being our first time and were shocked. Odd, but okay - we sat in the dining room inside and it was very cramped, we had to weave through the tables and were sat by the back windows. Our waitress and I'm assuming trainee since he was not introduced, were very kinda and gave us recommendations for their favorite dishes.   When we received our beer order, it was very warm which was disappointing as it was a hot day. Our food came fairly quickly, and looked great. Although to our surprise was very bland. It seemed to have no seasoning, and tasted very bare minimum, which didn't seem to follow the hype that the waiters were giving. My husband liked his meal more than I, but we both agreed we may at one point in the future try this place again. Everyone's experience is different.",

    "text": "I'm really torn on this one. I haven't been here in a very long time.   I had some vague recollection of the pricing and something I had previously tasted not being in line with my taste buds.   It was midday, I was starving and the place is close by and often packed. So, I decided to give it another go. My memory of the pricing was accurate, as was my taste bud recollection.   It wasn't too busy so we were seated very quickly. We were also brought chips, salsa and water very quickly. One thing for certain is our server was attentive.   My friend ordered the cuba libre, I ordered the agua frescas. No complaints on the drinks, at all.   But, of course, of course I ordered the same thing. I didn't realize this until my first bite. What do I normally go to? The vegan options. Always.   I ordered the vegan enchilada. The vegan cheese had me do a double take at the menu because it was creamy and deliciously deceptive (tasting like actual cheese). However, I just simply do not enjoy the enchilada sauce. It's a personal preference I'm sure but it to me, is a bit on the bitter side. It's almost like my salsa roja before I add lime and a wee bit of sugar. It's bitter burnt, something. I'm not sure. The veggies on the side were cooked well. My friend had the carnitas soft tacos and had no complaints at all but he found them smaller than expected (they're street taco size).   I'm determined at this point to try again and to just stay away from the enchiladas... now that I remember.",

    "text": "As others have stated, Los Sombreros is a cute place off Scottsdale and Virginia. A co-worker was looking for a tamale to satisfy a craving, and I Yelped this joint. She got a chicken tamale and the Mexican chocolate pie.   My co-worker enjoyed her tamale. I tasted it, and it was good, but nothing to write home about. The sauce on top, however, was an extremely tasty tomatillo. The Mexican chocolate pie was great. It was a huge hunk, so it was intimidating, as one could imagine the heavy, frosting-like chocolate. After stealing a bite of that too, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was very light...similar to a mousse. The flavor was good, but not as \"cinnamony\" as I would have hoped. Note that the meal also was served with salsa and a large gratis bag of chips.  Cut to today. My other friend and I decided to try this place out, being that our co-worker had been our taste-tester.  First of all, those who know me need only see this: ONLINE ORDERING!   We ordered online, noting that the process was very user-friendly. Upon arrival for pick-up, I noted that the restaurant was cute. It smelled of wonderful fire and food. The bar was cute, with nice wood and brickwork. The patio was fairly large, and was also nice. The hostess stand was between the bar and patio. Our order was to be picked up at the bar.  Our order was not yet ready, so we waited a few minutes. The owner came out and chatted us up, noting what folks like on the menu, and thanking us for coming in for a try. He was very nice.  Our food and drink came out in quality packaging and a brown bag. We did have to ask for chips and salsa, so that was a bit awkward. But he took care of us, and got a small container of super firey salsa for my gal pal.  My meal: Hibiscus tea. I guess I was expecting something else, but this was straight up jamaica. Not bad. Average. I ordered a green corn tamale with veggies and refried beans. The tamale was the highlight of the meal. It was prepared well, aesthetically pretty in service, and in that aforementioned fantastic tomatillo sauce. The veggies were just about julienne, and were a bit aldente for me. The refried beans were standard, and maybe even a little chunky for me.  Her meal: Chicken tacos with rice and beans. The rice had no flavor, and was very dry. She also found the refried beans standard. For the tacos, she opted for flour tortillas. They were very small, and she said that the chicken tasted oddly boiled. She also noted that two flour tacos cost the same as 3 corn tacos.  The chips: Pretty good. The bag was large.   The salsas: Hot: Super firey hot, but no flavor.                      Standard: A bit watery, pretty bland.                      Chipotle: My friend likened the taste to the smell of bandaids. I did NOT like this salsa.  I may return and try something else, but I'm not rushing to come back.",

Also, people who work here are so welcoming.  My favourite is their Michelada (A Mexican drink made with beer, lime juice, assorted sauces (often chili-based), spices, tomato juice, and chili peppers served in a chilled, salt-rimmed glass).  Also their Smoked chicken soft tacos, Potato Tacos, Guacamole and creamy Esquites were yummy.  My 5-star rating is purely for the Ambience and Micheladas:)",

    "text": "This is a really cute restaurant with a great patio attached. The ambiance is top-notch. I'd recommend checking out the menu first though to see if it aligns with what you're looking for in a Mexican place. My teen son was with us, and he just wanted some simple burritos or a quesadilla. They don't offer burritos and the quesadilla was a foodie's dream! (Mexican truffle, goat cheese, etc.) If you like more inventive Mexican food, then you're set here. If you're my teenaged son, not so much!  I enjoyed my chicken soft tacos. Every ingredient was good quality and tasty. My husband got Pechuga Rellena. (Grilled chicken breast stuffed with mushrooms and goat cheese.) He was totally in his element, loving the unique ingredients and flavors. All of us (my son included) loved the chips and salsa that were brought out first. I'd like to come back and try another menu item.",

    "text": "Okay, so the margaritas and guacamole were to die for. This location is very quaint and had a nice outdoor patio with misters as it is HOT. Granted, I wouldn't be bringing my pup here as it's too hot still in the afternoon. However, I saw one other person with a dog there. We liked our server who was efficient and attentive. However we were slightly disappointed in how long our dinner took in coming out. I guess the kitchen got way way behind? When it did finally come, it was tasty. He enjoyed his enchilada and I enjoyed my salad. Overall, we would go back as it was fun. The only down side was we were starving by the time the food came out. Parking is behind and around the side of this location. They do take reservations, so make one if you want to sit inside. Not a lot of seating inside. The patio isn't terrible with the misters on though.",

    "text": "My wife and I were really excited to try Los Sombreros. We went early on a Thursday evening to Happy Hour and dinner. I'm Celiac and need gluten-free and this place has LOTS of options for those looking for gluten-free.  Their happy hour prices were pretty good and the house margarita was solid for a standard margarita. We also got the queso rajas, al pastor tacos and guacamole all from the happy hour menu. The guacamole was very good but the queso and al pastor tacos left a lot to be desired. The flavor on the tacos was ok but they were relatively dry.  For dinner, I got the Puerco en Mole Verde and my wife had the Smoked Chicken Enchiladas. The Puerco en Mole was ok flavor wise and the presentation was good, but I wouldn't get it again. The smoked chicken enchiladas were just ok as well and my wife said she wouldn't order them again.  Overall it was very much a so-so experience and we may give it a try again because they have so many gluten-free options, but won't be our first choice given all the great food in the area.",

The beans and rice were also very good . Let's back up though ! We started with guacamole . It was simple and chunky and tasty . Like REAL authentic Mexican guacamole. Husband ordered the carnititas and stated they were the best he had ever had . He cooks carnitas at home and he said these were better than his . The margaritas were a little different and very very good . Service , excellent . The owner come to the table to see how we were doing . We have been visiting Scottsdale a week and this was easily the best meal we had . This is a must visit when in the area !",

Lunch time & literally no one else in there (bad sign).  Located in a very popular area but no one else there!  Waiter brings menu with dried food bits on it, yuk.  Six at our table & no one liked their food!  Tacos overloaded big time with white onions, meat tasted watered down with little spice, rice was disgusting, even ice tea sucked!  Couldn't eat anything after tasting a piece of the meat & one bite of rice!  Told the waiter food stinks & they still charged full price!  Don't go here!  Julio's Too is just right down the road from here & it has great food!",

Everything about this place is great - the indoor seating area is small but great furniture and chandelier gallery. The outdoor area is nice too. Staff friendly and timely.

We wish more restaurants used them, but they probably take up more valuable floor space or are more expensive. The building appeared to be a home conversion. The service was adequate. The food had a unique take which is a prerequisite in a city of predominately Mexican restaurants. The reason for the lost star is the price points. Two smoked chicken, the uniqueness, enchiladas for $15 isn't competitive with our usual places. Don Ruben's has combination dinners for $9.95 the last time we visited and the online menu states. Don't you hate it when the online prices don't match the menu upon arrival? They also have decent parking for Scottsdale and a beckoning patio which we didn't take advantage of because of temperature. Worth a try, but we probably won't return.",

From the time we first sat down to the time we left, I almost felt guilty for being there and making them take my order or bring my food out. This shouldn't ever be the case. After being sat, it took about 5 mins to get the menu, then another 5-10 to get a water, then another 5-10 to have our chips brought out. When ordering I told our waitress that I couldn't have dairy and asked to substitute guacamole for the cheese and sour cream. At first she told me they can't do that. I asked if they could charge me the difference or whatever since I can't have dairy and would like that in place. When she brought out the food, my side of guacamole was covered in cheese. I wanted to say something to our waitress but she never came back by. After being finished with our meal, we waited for our server to come back by, but she never did. After about 20 mins of waiting and noticing she came to the other two tables outside but not ours, I waited another 10 mins and finally resorted to going in and asking the manager for our bill. His only response was they got an unexpected rush of people coming in. The main dish was pretty good, but the sides were more bland. It was a very uncomfortable dining experience sadly.",

The tacos tortilla was smaller than my hand and with only four pieces of meat...the guacamolee was filledwith cabage on thebottom to make it look big and tons of onions....I was forced to scoop  out one huge spoon fulled of guacamole because a flie sat on top of it.  We were there for 20 min ....remember we were in a rush...but when we got the bill $135.00   they include a twenty dollar tip !!! Cannot belief I paide $135.00 for 18 tacos....and a two soda drinks...  NEVER GOING BACK....at night my feet were huge guess the meat was toooo salty.....",

I modeled my own guacamole recipe after theirs, it's that good. Try the specials of the day, they're always great.   The service has been a little hit & miss for me. Most of the time they're fine. There's this one woman who is extremely unfriendly. I think she just doesn't like me :-) But ya know, with food & ambiance like this, it doesn't bother me if I occasionally end up with a cranky server!",

    "text": "My husband was having some Mexican cravings one night, and as we always try to do to try a new place, we decided to try Los Sombreros which is only a few miles from home. As we pulled in the parking lot, we were surprised how packed the lot is so we thought this was a good choice. At the reception area, we got greeted and seated right away. Service is quite good as glasses with water and menu were handed as we take our seats. A basket of freshly made chips with mild salsa was served as we take time finding a good meal to choose. As we scan the two-page menu, we found the selection to be minimal and somewhat overpriced with only a few items costing to at least less than $10 and the rest within the range of $10-20. The chips and salsa were good enough that we asked for another serving without knowing that this will be charged, it was actually on the menu that per refill costs. Not a good thing I guess. We decided on Simmered pork in a pumpkinseed tomatillo mole sauce, presentation is nice but nothing really special as we take bites of it. It's an entree that comes with choices of refried beans, black beans, rice or vegetables and tortilla. The only thing that made my husband happy with the meal was the hot salsa that really made him sweat like he has never sweat before from eating hot salsa!   Overall, the experience didn't leave us happy and will not try to come back here again though I would rate the ambiance and decor high as it is inviting and homey.",

I've been to all the hyped places; Z'Tejas, Chevy's, Gardunos, Macayos, Tia Rosas, Carlsbad Tavern, Blue Adobe, Arribas, Salty Senoria (horrible), Pink Taco (deplorable). The food here is as quality as I've had with mexican.   I find many mexican places give you little taste with a heavy supply of starch and cheese. Their Carnitas and Lamb Chop are slow roasted and bursting with flavor. Margarita and salsa selection leaves a little to be desired, but this place is a can't miss. Save room for dessert, because the Mexican chocolate cream pie is simply amazing.  Alright I'm cutting back to 4 stars, the plates are great, but the margaritas could be better, and the chips and salsa leaves something to be desired.",

I was dubious of some of the reviews based on my experience, but hey, that was like I said a couple of years ago.  What my girlfriend and I experienced was fantastic food, wonderful service and just as I remembered it, a great atmosphere.  I had a tasty margarita, just the classic.  We ordered the guacamole to compliment our chips and salsa; which by the way comes with two salsas, one that is chunky and sweet with a small hint of heat, the other seemed to be tomatillo based and was equally good.  The guacamole was just as I remembered, chunky and delicious.  My girlfriend tried the Enchiladas de pollo.  She loved the flavor of the smoked chicken.  I had Puerco en Chipotle, which is slow roasted pork in a tomatillo-chipotle sauce.  It was darn good.  I didn't eat to much of my sides because I had consumed so much guacamole and the pork was just too good!  We were there on a Saturday night about 1900 and were seated immediately on the patio.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  Overall fantastic, just as I remembered.  Sure you may have to park on the street (we did); no worries, it's a great place.  Buen provecho",

We sat outside and it was really nice, the atmosphere was comfy and the music wasn't blasting so you could actually hear the people at your table.  Everyone in our party seemed happy with their meals. The guacamole was terrific and we all enjoyed our drinks (I had the white sangria which was pretty good). The food however was a little uneven. I had the crab enchiladas which were tasty but the sauce was so spicey it could have been any kind of meat in there. My friend has a chicken mole dish and she said the mole sauce was absolutely perfect. Someone had the shrimp cocktail which came in a gigantic glass, which was kind of funny (he said it was alright but didn't eat much of it).   I liked it enough to give it another shot next time I'm there.",

While the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area, that is about all this place has going for it.  I can't give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa, especially when the salsa is below average.  I ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed.  First the waitress messed up my order.  I clearly said I wanted the beans and rice, this is a mexican restaurant, right?  For some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans.  Umm...ok.  I didn't complain, bc I didn't want to wait any longer for my food.  But this is definitely a first.  Overall, the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard.    I will not return.",

    "text": "I've become a regular here, and I actually begin to miss this place if I go more than a couple of weeks without a visit.  It isn't so much that the ambiance readily engages or celebrates Mexican spirit and charm (it doesn't), or that seating is otherwise comfortable and spacious (it can be tight and some inside tables sit high).  But the food is amazing, the margaritas are my favorites anywhere, and the service has been excellent (with one rare exception when it seemed to take exorbitantly long for our waitress to initially appear).    I'm one of those rare individuals in the southwest who doesn't generally care for guacamole ... pureed avocado (to baby food consistency) with chopped tomatoes is generally not my thing.  But I genuinely can't get enough of the guacamole at Sombreros.  Its chunky avocado, cilantro, tomatoes, lime, and cheese are perfectly put together and served with chips that can carry the load while still managing to be light.  My wife and I typically throw caution to the wind (given that we intend to order dinner entrees, as well), and order the large portion.  There's never any left and we duel for the last bits with warring chips (I hate to admit I lose most of the time).  Although the guacamole is by far our favorite, other appetizers are excellent as well.  The queso fundido (with multiple choices for fillings) is very good, and my wife swears by the huitlacoche crepas, which she often has as a main course to follow the guacamole.  We've never had any entree that didn't live up to expectation, and the Puerco en Chipotle is a favorite that is hard to ignore every time we come.  The pork is incredibly tender and juicy, the chipotle sauce (more like a juice) is spicy without being overwhelming.  With a couple of warm tortillas if you want them, its hard to leave a bite behind.  The Lamb Adobo is excellent as well, and the Pollo con Espinacas (with a chipotle cream sauce) is a spicy taste treat.  The Puerco en Mole Verde received high marks as well.  The entrees come with two traditional sides, and beans, rice, etc. are all fine but nothing exceptional.  Always hoping to find a great margarita when we're out, I've tried many.  There are some good ones to be found to be sure, but I'm impressed by the quality and pour at Sombreros.  My personal favorite is the Cadillac, but there are many excellent ones from which to choose and an outstanding selection of tequilas if you're partial to shots and chasers.    It's been a couple of weeks since I've been there ... I'm feeling the pull.",

    "text": "Los Sombreros serves the Mexican delicacy Huitlacoche (Corn Smut in English...I know which language I prefer) which is pretty cool and something everyone should get the chance to try. The place is really cute so a meal out on the patio feels a little like a short trip over the border. The menu doesn't have a lot of options for vegetarians (me) but I still really enjoyed my meal & would come back, that's how much I like this place. My boyfriend & I had:  - Queso Fundido with Rajas: Delicious - good real cheese mixed with a lot of peppers & onions. I liked that there was some salsa (or a lot of cooking liquid from the peppers) mixed in with the cheese so it was a lighter fundido than just full on cheese. - Guacamole: Love their guac. It's really chunky & really fresh. - Huitlacoche Crepas: Such an interesting dish & totally unlike what I've had at other Mexican restaurants. The flavor of Huitlacoche is hard to describe - it's savory, a little like mushrooms, has a creamy texture. The flavor combination of the dish was very sweet & savory - savory huitlacoche with sweet pomegranate sauce and seeds with tart blue cheese, all wrapped in a soft crepe.  - Carnitas: My boyfriend ordered this and said the meat was really good. The serving size is enough for 2 meals. The corn tortillas that came with it were really good and fresh. The mexican rice and refried beans that came with it were probably not vegetarian and were just average.  I noticed in the kitchen they cook over a wood-burning stove, which seemed rather authentic and must make their food that much better. The bar is outside & looks like a beach bar, adding to the fun atmosphere.",

The portions were okay, but I still left unsatisfied and hungry..  There are plenty of good Mexican places that serve way better food at almost half the price of Los Sombreros entrees.

They were too busy to allow us to sit at a regular table.  (2) They won't do separate checks. (3) The chips came with only two \"wagon wheel\" chips. The second basket had none, so only half our group got to try them. The basket at the next table had a bunch of them.  Now, the good stuff. The food was very good. I ordered the green corn tamales. They were almost as good as the ones I used to get in Tucson. The others in my party also enjoyed their food. We ordered the guac and it was good, but the presentation piled it high in a mocohete that made it hard to get some on a chip without pushing the rest of the mountain over onto the table or floor. The two in our group that had margaritas said they were delicious, but friends who went the night before said their margaritas were ordinary. Portions were generous. I'm glad I ordered from the left side of the menu or I would have had to be rolled out the door.",

Very trendy outdoor eating and bar area, lots of seating - but the bar is tiny, maybe five or six stools. The wait can be an issue, not a place to go if you are in a hurry or starved. Their guacamole is really good, but needs salt and they stuff the bottom of the cool rock bowl with tons of lettuce. The cilantro is a nice touch. Good chips and salsa, why do they charge for it when their entre's are NOT cheap. You pay for the name here, but the quality has not dipped over the years. Really good margaritas, again, a bit overpriced. I am a creature of habit, if I want something different I will go to another restaurant... I always have the Crepas de mariscos - fish/shrimp/crab stuffed enchiladas. Delicious spicy green sauce and the shrimp is NOT over cooked! My wife got the smoked chicken enchilada and liked it - pretty low key response for her, not blown away.   We will go back again, they are 'on par' with Frank and Lupe's which is further north in Old town, I think off Marshall.

    "text": "First Impressions: Slow service, and seemingly inattentive waiting staff, always busy (in that \"will they remember I am sitting here?\" kinda way).  The patio is nice to sit at, but that isn't enough to keep me coming back. Maybe I would be more patient on another day, but today I had my five and six year old sons in tow. Don't the wait staff know what a chore it is to keep children seated and entertained while hungry?  There is a special place in hell for restaurateurs that make parents endure this trauma...  As I waited for food. I was getting more and more pissed, and I broke out my mobile yelp to draft a scathing review. BUT, then my food came out.  And damned if I wasn't pleasantly surprised.  All the ingredients were super fresh and cooked to perfection (no wilted veggies or overcooked/dry chicken here).  I've been here a few times and never remember being to so impressed.  Not that they were bad before, just not real memorable.  But this meal was _much_ better than the previous occasions. Did they get new kitchen staff? Are my taste buds off today? Or have I just been ordering the wrong entrees all along? Whatever the case--my food today was delicious (I ordered the chicken enchiladas BTW).    SO... I have mixed feelings about this place.  Service did pick up during the end of the night, but at first it was abysmal.  Food was delicious, but previous visits didn't impress.  Drinks were passable.  Chips and salsa, also passable but not great.   Ambiance, very nice.    Overall, I think I will be back.  Maybe it was an off day for service, or maybe it was an exceptional day for the cook.  Who knows.  But they've earned another try.",

Let me start by saying being the son of a mexican chef makes me very, very judgmental. But I can still be fair. The pozole was good. 3.5 stars out five. Good broth and meat. The hibiscus tacos were ok. 2.5 stars. Nothing you would order again. The fig and panela salad was good. 3 stars. Cheese and dressing were great. Shrimp and Papaya salad was ok. 2 stars. Shrimp was old (typical AZ shrimp) Salmon was great! 4 stars. I would order it again. Trout was ok. 2 stars. AZ Fish not very good. Stuffed chicken was great! 4 stars. I mean its stuffed chicken, how can it go wrong? Chile relleno with beef picadillo. Now the star of this show, 5 stars. The inside reminded of a desert they make in Sonora, MX. Its called capirotada. Its sweet and salty, maybe a hint a syrup? Pork loin. 2 stars. Not very inspiring Piloncillo Ice cream. 3 stars. It need something to cut the same flavor profile and make it a complete desert. Look, I know people say its great, but Barrio Cafe is way better with the same $$ point and flavor profile. I want to like it. I really do. But its not what it is cracked up to be.",

    "text": "Coming into the Phoenix area for a family party, we stopped off at Los Sombreros for some margaritas and Mexican on an otherwise cooler night in the valley of the sun.   I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only \"try\" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is.   Moving on, we somehow \"lucked out\" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale.   The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose.   The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up.   The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable.   The fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well I'm not really one to combine seafood and cheese, this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and I'd recommend it to a first timer, +1 if you request to add spinach.   Finally moving on to the entrees, different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors, assortments and sizes.   I myself ordered what I was told is sort of the house specialty ,call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal. While it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me, the flavor of the pork wasn't really there, at, all.   I browsed over a couple other reviews and noted the same complaint but hey that's what hot sauce is for I guess.   Overall it's an alternative to the chains hoarding Scottsdale road.",

The menu is pleasantly concise and you won't have to worry about feeling overwhelmed choosing an entree.  I had the smoked chicken enchiladas, one of six or so meat choices, with rice and black beans on the side.  The meal came to the table after a short wait, occupied by a nice serving of homemade tortilla chips & house salsa.  Entrees came garnished with steamed vegetables and were hot and fresh.  I could definitely tell that the tortilla used for the enchiladas was homemade and the sauce was stellar. It was quite flavorful with strong cilantro and garlic tones.  If you do not like cilantro, you may not like the sauce, but I found it to be very fresh and zesty.  An experience well deserving of 5 stars.",

Right after we ordered drinks three employees sat next to us and started to assemble Silverware and napkins and speaking very loudly. Really! One of my favorite dishes in Mexico is Steak Tampiquena, usually a marinated flank steak with cheese enchiladas. My wife and I both ordered it. Not sure what kind of steak it was but it was flavorless and overdone, we both ordered it medium. It also showed up already cut up, which is probably why it was overdone. The enchilada was very small, lacked much sauce and was cold as well. Refried beans were watered down mess. It was like buffet food slapped on a plate. No sizzling steak, no melting cheese, no sauce, no flavor. Help!! Just annoying employees doing their side work next to us. Help!!. This is our third and last time here. The prices are very high for what you get which is below average food and above average prices. Chips and bad \"salsa\" are extra. No mas Sombreros, the food has gone south and not in a good way.

You do not need to pay extra to go to this place. I saw a review in Phoenix magazine and decided to check this place out. The only explanation I can possibly think of is that the  reporter got lazy and decided to skip on the meal and browse the website instead. Literally everything we got from our chips and salsa to our main entrees (recommended by the waiter) was bland.   The patio is cute although we had to sit by some tanks of gasoline which wasn't really a good vibe. While I'm sure this place is healthier than some of the other mexican restaurants it's not worth it.",

    "text": "Being native Arizonans, we have had every conceivable combination of tortilla, meat, cheese, lettuce, etc.  There is comfort in the same ol' chips and salsa starter followed by some sort of tortilla combination bent, folded, or fried served with a bit of lowered expectations.  And then there is Los Sombreros....  How have we lived for years just down the street from this unbelievable gem?  Layered, nuanced flavors in everything - including an incredible smoky tomatillo salsa that hints of mesquite in the fireplace.  I had a carnitas dish that almost had a barbecue sweetness layered over chipotle smokiness.  Layers.  If you like your food \"brown, hot and plenty of it,\" then Los Sombreros might not be for you.  If you want a taste of Mexico's best family traditions then make your way to Los Sombreros.  We will be hard pressed to return to standard Mexican fare after tasting this food.",

    "text": "Love, Love, Love, Los Sombreros!  This is a wonderful, South-Scottsdale gem that just keeps getting better!    Here's Why: *Food, OMG, seriously amazing. I have tried multiple things on the menu (weekend brunch, lunch, dinner, and desserts) and never had something I did not think was outstanding.  Fresh, flavorful, innovative takes on traditional items (while staying True to many of the great things about Mexican cuisine).  This is NOT Tex-Mex, its real flavors that some of the best dining in Mexico has to offer.   *Staff/Service, you will probably almost always see one of the owners there when you come in, they are very involved in ensuring a great delivery but even when you don't, the staff is truly outstanding.  Ask them for recommendations, they will never steer you wrong and they are happy to accommodate special requests whenever they can.  They treat you like family.  *Atmosphere, I am \"partial\" to their large outdoor patio in back, you might not even realize it's there from the street but it's a great spot to dine (weather permitting) and the outdoor bar while small, is quaint and reminds me of some of the great beach-side bars in Mexico.    So thankful to have this level of cuisine in S. Scottsdale while keeping a neighborhood feel with quality results.",

We overheard the owner say they just bought it and they are doing a great job! Too bad we don't live here...simply a must try if you are in this area. Chocolate pie is to die for!!!",

After my second bite I was not only grossed out, but seriously concerned for my safety and that of the other patrons, as the chicken in my tortilla soup smelled gamey and rotten.  My wife sent back her posole as well, as it was flavorless.  The people were extremely nice and immediately took these off my bill when we sent it back - something we NEVER do. My 7 year old son seemed to like his food, which he ate before mine arrived, but now, a few hours later, he's sick to his stomach.  Again, very nice people and a great atmosphere, and from what I saw it looks like they make good cocktails, but the food itself was not good and appears to have made my kiddo sick.  I can't say I'd ever come back.",

Fresh guacamole was great but portions could be better...we had to order 2 large for group of 5. Oh, the Margaritas are wonderful too!!",

    "text": "So yesterday, May 6th, my 2 friends and I went here because I raved about how good the food is .. and the food is definitely 5 star!!!    The 1 star rating is for the situation that occurred yesterday. It was HOT out there, HOT, like 104.  The bar to the is naturally connected to the building, meaning, that the entrance to the bar is an open door to the rest of restaurant, well inside the dining room there were only 2 other tables when we sat down. We opted to sit at a table that was NOT year an a/c vent as one my friends was elderly and did not like the a/c blowing on her.  So here is the MAJOR PROBLEM I have and why I rated this 1 star.  So the flies that were INSIDE the restaurant were RIDICULOUS, I mean it ruined the whole dinner!! We were constantly killing flies, swatting flies, off us, off our food, out of our drinks.   HERE is my beef: when we told the restaurant staff, hostess and waitress, we were told that the Ecolab guy was supposed to show up there earlier in the day but cancelled and was going the next day.  MY PROBLEM IS THIS: they KNEW the flies were bad, they KNEW the Ecolab person was not coming for another day, THERE IS AN ACE HARDWARE less than 1/2 mile down the road, WHY DIDN'T THEY GO TO ACE AND GET SOME FLY TRAPS/FLY STRIPS......SOMETHING  TO CONTROL THE FLIES????  It was  utterly ridiculous.  I LOVE this place, the food is amazing, but to knowingly sit people in a room full of flies and be ok with it??? WRONG ANSWER!   I know this place is under new ownership as of some time last year, because when I took my then bf there one of the owners was there and actually came to our table to ask how we were and how our service and food was. He was pretty young, and I hope that he will read this review and school his employees on this.  As we were leaving a group of about 10 people came in to sit in the dining room, we thought, 'oh great, something to draw the flies away rom us\" lol, but as quickly as they sat down they left to sit out side, when I asked if they were leaving because of the flies, they said YES !!!",

She recommended Los Sombreros, so we grabbed a Lyft and were pleasantly surprised at the great atmosphere and 'home cooking' vibe. Our waiter, David, was pleasant and attentive. He seemed genuinely excited to recommend his favorites that he was certain we would enjoy.  The fresh chips came out piping hot and were delicate and crispy. They may have been a little too good because I could not stop my hand reaching for more of them before I realized I was probably going to ruin my appetite. The guacamole was fresh, delicious, and generously portioned. The shrimp cocktail included perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp in a wonderful sauce. For our main course, we shared the Lamb Adobo, which was a full lamb shank, slow cooked to fall off the bone tenderness.",

The chips are plain, salsa is good, of each dish we've chosen, none was eatable! The refried beans tasted anything but beans! All we can say is that it is a shame such a good location, and potential, we so little care for the food it self! Hopefully it will change for nothing remains the same forever!",

    "text": "How refreshing. A real gourmet mexican (yes, i said that) joint I can ride a bike to. Moving to South Scottsdale, from downtown, has been somewhat frustrating. But being this close to Los Somberos is a big help.  I first went several years ago when they were in a strip mall on S. Scottsdale Rd. Got dragged there by a couple local restaurant people who kept raving about it. Shockingly fucking spicy and delicious. One app had us hallucinating. Loved it.  Time passed and they opened up this great little house-style location further up the road. Apparently the chef/owner and his wife got divorced. She kept the place. I was worried. But she's making it work fantastically.  THINGS TO TRY:  steve the bartender's margaritas: you can actually taste the tequila, so call your favorite. i like the patron silver marg. many prefer the cadillac marg that has orange juice. bear in mind, when you are talking, steve is listening. he has ears like a bat. if you don't want him to hear you saying something embarrassing about yourself, don't say it.  shrimp fundido: white cheese melted over sauteed fajita-style veggies and big fresh-tasting shrimp. great with corn or flour tortillas.  chips: pretty good. the salsas are a little mild for my taste. not bland, they have plenty of tart and sweetness. just wish they were rounded out a little more.  smoked chicken tacos: only ask for this when it's already the special. they'll try to accommodate when it isn't the special, but it will pale. when it's a legit special, they use nicely smoked, succulent dark meat. not that cubed up breast junk. i hate chicken breast. 5 stars if they add this to the daily menu.  carne asada tacos: consistently best i've had in PHX.  carnitas: a very generous, juicy, tender portion. they always happily hand over flour tortillas for me.  beef short rib: get this if you require lots of flavor. and by flavor, i mean rendered beef fat.  Lots of other stuff on the menu, and always at least one app and one dinner special. Enjoy!",

They put the veggies in with both dishes, make it impossible to eat either (didn't realize until I got home.) The lamb was boiled and in a sauce that made it impossible to taste the meat - it was just chewy sauce. The mexican rice had next to no flavor, the salsa ordered came in two tiny side containers you'd get at Filibertos, and one of the two salsa types had next to no flavor - it was water, cilantro, and a couple of chunks of onion and tomato.   The guacamole was tasty, and the chips were fresh, but that is the only good thing I can say about this experience.",

Food is exceptional, not your typical rice and beans fare.  The crab mango salad is gorgeous, fresh and just divine.  Wonderful quesos funditos to choose from too. We watched other dishes go by and wished we had two stomachs. It is NOT in the over touristy old town area, so make a point to get here. Dessert flan with special tequila on top was to die for.  We are fussy foodies, and this place met our expectations. Definitely returning to this find!",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant a few times, but it had been a while, so I decided to go back with my family during Arizona Restaurant Week.  We actually ended up ordering off of the regular menu instead of the fixed menu.    We started with the guacamole - if you like guac, this is a must! It is not tableside like my other favorite upscale Mexican restaurant, but it is still great.  The chips it is served with are good - not too salty - but the salsa they serve is marginal.  They offer two kinds, which were both very watery and bland, but maybe I am just really picky having been raised on homemade spicy salsa?   For my entree, I ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas.  These were absolutely amazing.  It was heaven in my mouth.  When I took that first bite, I literally just sat there and savored all the flavors exploding in my mouth.  The chicken was so tender and smoky, and the green sauce was a little tangy yet spicy.  The enchiladas came with black beans and rice, which nicely complemented the entree.  The rest of my family ordered the mole poblano, which was white meat chicken (you have to request this) drenched in mole sauce.  I love mole sauce, and this was definitely one of the better ones I've had.   I would recommend heading here when the weather cools down because they have a great patio and live music out there.  The ambiance inside is pretty unmemorable, and the service inside was not that great either.  Hopefully, it is better outside - that along with some better salsa would make my Los Sombreros experience complete!",

I get the pollo con espinacas and he gets the pollo enchiladas.   It was a nice evening so we chose to sit in the outdoor patio area - great atmosphere with twinkling lights, little fire pits going and a guy playing guitar and singing in Spanish. They were very busy that night so the food did take a little while to get, but other than that the service was good. And besides, you have the chips and salsa to snack on while they prepare your food.  Los Sombreros is not your typical taco shop. Don't walk in expecting to find greasy tacos and humongous burritos. It's more what I would call \"foofy\" (technical term) Mexican food.  My pollo con espinacas is two generous portions of chicken served in a chipotle cream sauce with spinach. On the side you can get rice, beans or veggies so I got rice and veggies. This dish is SO good. The chipotle cream sauce is just the right combination of spicy and creamy - make a great dip for the chips too! And the portion is big enough I always take half home.  I didn't get a margarita but this place has a HUGE list of tequilas so if you're looking for something other than Cuervo this place can satisfy.  I've always been happy with my dining experience at Los Sombreros. It's a great date place with great food.",

They close the restaurant annually to go down to Mexico to brush up on their cooking and keep the menu current.   Now - if you are not a foodie, and only think Mexican food is supposed to be smothered in cheese (like my father), don't go, because you'll be taking up a seat that should go to a real lover of fine cuisine.

This is not the case at Los Sombreros!!!   The atmosphere is sooooo great -- an old house thats been redone with a great porch and fantastic big outdoor bar.  For food I got the mango crab salad which was amazing!!! Light and refreshing, but incredible flavor.  We also had an awesome watermelon salad and my date had a pork dish that was really good too.  His portion was so big but not overly creasy or heavy...just too much.  Mine was the perfect light meal even though the waitress said it was small; thus they probably are accustomed to big portions.   This is not your typical mexican fare.  Everything was very fresh and not too greasy.  The sangria was good and the margaritas were pretty good as well, although not fantastic.  Over all a winner!! Sit at the covered outdoor bar if you can and watch the monsoons come in.  A great date night out!",

And every time we asked, the waiter would look at ask like \"really - you want more water?\"  Then, even though it was a Wednesday night and not crowded at all, they kept trying to kick us out (they tried to take my plate twice while I was still eating).  I probably won't go again.",

I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and the food has been consistently fresh and excellent in taste and presentation. It is not your typical Mexican food. This place serves dishes that one would not find in Los Olivos or La Tolteca. I had the green and black bean corn tamales. They are phenomenal! The queso fundido dip is fabulous as well. I like how it is a small, quaint place. If you want to avoid the rush go around 4:30 pm. otherwise outside seating will be the next best bet aside from waiting for a table inside since the place holds around 35 people total.",

    "text": "The Phoenix metro is all about hidden gems.  Anyone who hates the Valley because \"it has no character, everything is a chain\" just doesn't know where to go.  Los Sombreros is a prime example of this.  \r \r I have known about this place for a while but have never stopped in because, well, it doesn't have much curbside appeal as you roar by on Scottsdale Road in the XXX zone.   Shame on me.  I went this weekend and walking in the back was like being transported to a friendly cantina in Mexico.  The ambiance, service, and food were all delightful.  This is authentic/gourmet type dishes in a casual setting that includes an outdoor patio and bar.  The scale of the whole place is small and intimate.  I had seafood crepes in some kind of avocado sauce.  The plates around me looked equally delightful, from the traditional mole to the carnitas to the mango crab salad.  The pepitas crusted snapper is next on my list to try.   I'll be back again... soon.",

It's so nice to be appreciated--when we came in the hostess immediately recognized us and welcomed us back.  The food was incredible and the margueritas the best in the city.  Especially good are the tamales and the enchiladas.  My husband enjoyed the corn chowder and his three tacos.  Try the hibiscus tacos for something out of the ordinary!",

    "text": "The food is FABULOUS.  The service SUCKED.  Capital S SUCKED.  My friends and I had been dying to try this place.  We met last night, and started with a drink at the bar.  They had cocktails, and I had a glass of white sangria -- it was pretty good, not fantastic.  The bartender was really nice, and pretty darn cute too (this wasn't the Scottish guy -- which I was sort of hoping to see -- I'm a total sucker for the accent).  We ordered the guacamole, which is truly divine.  Chunky, with a good amount of cilantro.  It comes on a bed of cabbage and some a radishes.  My friends thought that was kind of weird, but I thought it was good!  The chips were good, and they came with these weird sort of pinwheel-y things.  I didn't care for them, but my friends liked them.  We decided to get a few things for dinner and just share them.  We moved from the bar to our table and ordered the seafood tacos.  They were spectacular!  The fish and shrimp were tender and delicious.  We all raved!  Next, we got the carnitas.  The pork was so delicious.  It had a lot of carmelized bits, which are of course my favorite part.  There was a bit of fat on it, which I had to pull off....  Blech.....  But it was so good, I didn't mind the fat removal.  They were served with black beans and rice or veggies and corn tortillas.  I would absolutely recommend this to anybody.    It was around this time that the service REALLY got annoying.  The server and bussers kept coming by to see what they could clear from the table.  Literally they came by THREE times in ten minutes.  And it's not as if there was a huge queue at the hostess stand, and there were a few open tables.  So why the pushiness?  Did they NOT want us to stay and order more drinks?  Apparently not.    My friend really wanted to try the green chile tamales.  So she ordered those, and they were good, but I was in no way WOWED.  After bringing those out, they came by again another two times to clear.  Finally we just gave in and told them to clear the table!  Fine ya bastards, take our plates!  Another point to make -- the food came out incredibly quickly -- which was nice at FIRST, but after the pushiness of the server and bussers, it just made us feel like they were trying to turn the tables and just get us out of there.  I will definitely come back because the food was delicious.  My friends and I all commented about how interesting their menu was -- there were many different things we all hoped to try in the future.  Maybe last night's pushiness was a fluke.  I hope the next time I don't feel so much pressure to leave!",

    "text": "I went to Los Sombreros last night and was pretty excited to check it out since I live close and have heard great things about it.  OK...so we get there and there is no where to park..there is a lot behind the restaurant that I believe belongs to Pep Boys and has signs up saying you'll be towed if not a pep boys customer.....ugh...we took our chances since there was no where else to parking (we were thankfully not towed).  It was pretty crowded..but I was ok with that...especially since it was a Friday night. ...and then I got to meet the hostess.   Got up to her podium she looks straight at us and without saying anything like \"excuse me for a minute\" she turns her back to us and has a 5 minute conversation with a someone working there (which I would have been understanding about had she acknowledged I was standing there at least.  When her conversation is done  she asks how many, we say 4 (2 friends were meeting us and were seconds away).  When we ask about an estimate in time for the wait she says she won't \"worry about that\" until all of our party was here...I explained they were in the parking  lot..blah, blah....Her attitude was nasty and  giving me a poor first impression.  Red Sangria was Mmmmm, Queso fundido with chorizo was WOW, sea food tacos were just ok, chips and salsa were just ok....and all of it was a little over-priced!  My fav thing about this place was the ambiance...big patio outside with some fire pits going...a man playing mexican tunes on a guitar...and warm colors throughout.....Still I really don't think I will be returning..",

Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable, sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard, a little better than \"just OK\".  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp, me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split!  we had such a fun time, the service was good, food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual, albeit fairly romantic meal.",

Portions weren't very substantial considering the price, although the Chile Relleno I had over the holidays was decent, as was the queso appetizer - decent.  But this is big bucks, big wait, and it felt like I was moving through a small maze to get to the restroom.  Server had an attitude and neglected us at several points during our dining experience.  I hear about how authentic they are, but even if this is so, it's just not worth it.  Also, very few options for vegetarians, unlike most Mexican places which do have such options nowadays.",
