They are the drier version of this dish (not swimming in sauce), which I prefer. I also don't really like shrimp and they substitute the shrimp with chicken.  I always get take out so i can't comment on a dining experience, but the take out is always fast and ready to go when they say it will be.  Good food, fast friendly service.",

With the amazing reviews and extremely high prices I was ready to be impressed. I was not. In fact, this was what my mom called \"the worst American Chinese food I've had in my life\". The food was bland and greasy, to the point where we felt so bad that we took the majority of our overpriced entrees to our house just to throw it out. The po po platter (which they called a Bo Bo platter?) was dry and the plum sauce accompanying it was watery. My sweet and sour chicken, was tough and cold. The meat, not covered in what would be a sweet red sauce, was snow White. My mothers 'Desert Jade Shrimp' was, as she said, \"only covered in butter\". The only two good things in this restaurant  was the Mai Tais and the service. I was appalled by this meal. It was not worth the trip.",

But, don't let the location and appearance turn you off. This is a great place if you have a lot of friends who don't mind having \"family style\" Chinese food.  The sauces are very light and flavorful.  The portions are ample the lazy-susan helps get the food moving between your friends.  The staff and the owner had no problems handling a horde that wanted one of everything.

    "text": "AMBIANCE: We came here after we heard this place achieved the dean's list on dirty dining. I was going to only give this place 2 stars (see below) but because this place was not dumpy like other Chinese restaurants and actually was clean and comfortable, this was part of the reason why I raised my rating. It reminded me of when I was a kid in 80s and would go to Steak & Ale with my family. It was very dark inside, which I love when it's 110 degrees outside, with dark furniture and windows you can see out of, unlike other Chinese places where they have to keep their windows shaded or blocked out for some odd reason. But this place has nothing to hide. Upon entering it is nice to see a full bar and to be greeted right away. I believe this is a family restaurant, and you can see the pride in the way the place is kept up. It is super clean, not dusty or dingy, and the bathroom is immaculate. Nice touch, even though the sun had not set yet, was the placement of lit candles on EVERY table, and only a few were occupied. I also noticed a fireplace, which must be nice if they light it in the winter.  FOOD: one word, BLAND! I just don't understand. From appetizer to entree, everything was missing either sweet, salt, or both. The fried wontons could have a used a lot more filling and the \"sweet\" orangey sauce was not even sweet. What?! The fried dumplings looked like they stuck to the pan, as they were slightly black and some were broken from when they tried to remove from the pan (probably not enough oil, or they walked away for too long). The familiar sauce that came with it was not salty enough so I just used soy sauce. The Kung Pao chicken was unlike any I've had before. Where were the red and green bell peppers? Missing. Where was the heat, even though it was in red to indicate spicy on the menu? Missing. It was just chicken, lots of green onion bottoms, peanuts, and those whole red chiles no one eats but is supposed to add heat. The sesame chicken, usually with a very sweet sauce, was not. The chicken was okay, but slightly overcooked, noticeable by the very dark brown fried coating. I didn't like the tangerine beef: when you have any meat sliced thin, hello, it must be cooked no more than a minute or two or tough, as it was in this case. Think beef jerky. I noticed that the restaurant kept filling up with old people and I thought that maybe a nursing home was nearby, but then it dawned on me; they like bland food so this place was like their mother ship!  SERVICE: This also led me to raise a star as the service was stellar. More than a few people from a couple waitresses to several bussers, took great care of us. They even wrapped the pancakes for our mu shu pork dish for us. Everyone is so friendly and served with a smile, I so want this place to succeed.   Yes, you are in Phoenix and the pickings are slim for the traditional, Americanized, Chinese restaurant that serves the freshest and tastiest food. Add some fresh spice, honey, turbinado sugar, fish sauce, whatever!, just turn it up a notch and watch those cooking temps (don't forget fresh meat and frying oil) and you'll have a winner. Add then add home delivery and you'll corner the market. In the meantime, I have found my current benchmark, Chou's Kitchen in Chandler, and I will have to trek it out there when I want the best, until I find something better.",

    "text": "Hooray! I may have found my dish here!  I came back on a Friday night at dinnertime. The weird, empty atmosphere was replaced with the chatter of other tables and several bustling waitstaff.  For appetizers we ordered egg rolls and fried wontons. Not the highlight of the meal, but they were pretty cheap, so whatever.  For my meal I ordered a spicy chicken dish and added vegetables because I can't just eat a plate of saucy fried food without something healthy. This meant my dish was pretty expensive, but it was 2 meals worth, so worth it. The chicken was perfectly crunchy on the outside, tender inside, and the vegetables were still a little crunchy and a good mix. Ordering it at heat level 6 was perfect for me, though I ate around a few jalapenos because it would have kicked it up to an 8.  The servers were very attentive, and my water glass was always full. The lady who sat us and brought the food was like a fussy mother, in a good way, as she rearranged the plates and glasses to make more food fit on the table.  It was so good, I boxed half of it up so I wouldn't look like a pig, then I finished it as soon as I got home.",

I also had the pot stickers and those are done correctly - they steam them first and then give them a sear in a frying pan.  Highly recommend for these two items - I'll have to go back and check out the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Holy general Tso's ghost. How did I not discover this place before? So I was in my office and had a wicked craving for Chinese food. But the only place I knew of was Panda Express on 40th and Thomas... I'd rather eat my shoe with siracha than that panda. So I turned to the break room to see what fliers or menus were posted on the cork board... And Lo an behold ... Desert Jade.  It was not far at all doe my office and said what the hell I'll try it out. Drove over and liked that it was quiet and quaint. Not to over the top with typical Chinese restaurant decor... I couldn't find any Buddha statues or that annoying waving cat that you can't help but poke it's paw. It was very relaxed and cozy.  Immediately they brought out water and hot tea... The hot tea by itself with no sugar is awsome. Not sure what kind of tea it is, green maybe or ginger, don't know don't care, it was good.  The lunch menu is very inexpensive and very plentiful portions. I ordered the sweet and sour pork with fried rice. It was very rich in flavor for a classic lunch time go to. The fried rice was simple and didn't have crazy extras like bamboo shoots or bean sprouts. Two hearty scoops of fried rice and an egg roll plus my swee and sowa pohkk ... Great food and very hearty portions and left with a bill less than $10 with tip. Can't get that at panda, and unlike Panda, it didn't do the express blowout 30 minutes later in the office bathroom. Great little place hidden off indian school. Will definitely be going back.",

I love it so much that I try to check out newer or older places in the hopes that they are the good stuff... the real deal... the place you think of when you crave Chinese even if you aren't close.  This is that place for me.  Every single thing I have ordered here has been fantastic.  I have been here many many times but just getting around to reviewing it.  In fact Ive been coming here before I even knew I was coming here.  Let me explain:  When I was wee tike and living in Michigan I came to visit my grandparents once a year in Scottsdale.  My grandfather used to take us to this Chinese restaurant because it was his favorite.   For at least two decades after he passed my mother and I scoured the valley because we could not remember the name or area it was in.  It wasn't until recently that I raved about this place and took my parents here that my mother gasped, for she remembered every detail about it.  Lo and behold it was Desert Jade.  Not only my grandfathers favorite Chinese joint in the entire valley but mine as well.    Desert Jade is legitimate.  They care about their customers and have been around for decades in a small place that is not particularly easy to park in.  Yet its always packed and for very good reason.  I love you Desert Jade and will continue to eat here every opportunity I can.  Thanks for the memories.",

I had high hopes for Desert Jade and was hoping the food had improved from Gabi's 3-star review back in 2009, but I was not impressed and it seems that the reviews range widely here.   The three food items we tried tasted fresh, but were seriously lacking in flavor.   The Wor Won Ton Soup came with a generous serving of shrimp, pork, and beef pieces and vegetables, but the wontons were dense balls of dough that, as another reviewer mentioned, tasted more like gnocchi rather than meat-filled wontons.   The Beef with Broccoli came with the thinest sauce I've ever had that had the flavor and consistency of beef broth. The beef was a tad overcooked and the broccoli was limp from being overcooked.   The Chicken Chow Mein was the biggest disappointment as I was looking forward to the big, fat soft noodles that I have enjoyed and every other Chinese restaurant I've ever dined!! The lady on the phone said \"Pan fried?\" when I ordered, which I guess I was supposed to know meant, \"Be prepared for thin, vermicelli-type noodles.\" Again, no real flavor to the chow mein dish, though the chicken was tender.   On the plus side, the service was friendly and the food was ready quickly. I just wish the food was up to par with the service.",

When we arrived the owner, we recognized her from the show, was sitting at the hostess stand reading something and never looked up to acknowledge us standing there in front of her waiting for the hostess to seat us.  On the Check Please episode she carried on about how much she loves people and her customers.  When my family dines at Flo's, even when they are hoping busy, the owner, Flo makes a point of making some contact with every customer every time.  By the way when we left the owner, still sitting at the hostess stand reading her phone or whatever, never said goodbye or thank you as we left.  We started with the Hot and Sour soup (and the Egg Drop soup) and pot stickers.  The Hot and Sour soup had nice shrimp and pork in it although it was more Sweet and Sour.  My son said his Egg Drop soup was o.k.  The pot stickers looked home made, but not a lot of flavor..just meh.  For our entrees we ordered: Sauteed Shrimp (Highly Recommended), $13.25 Shrimp w/ a light egg batter, deep fried & sauteed w/ green onions  *The batter on the shrimp was not crisp and was not sauced or seasoned.  I WOULD NOT       recommend this dish to anyone. Mongolian Beef, $9.25 Sliced beef marinated in a brown sauce, sauteed w/ green onions  *The meat was tender although the sauce was very thin/soupy and not much flavor. Spicy Eggplant w/ Garlic Sauce, $7.95 *Although the portion was generous, this dish was neither spicy or garlicky. BBQ Pork Fried Rice, $6.95 *This was adequate.  So disappointed because of the great reviews given on Check Please AZ.  We ordered some of the same dishes featured on the show too.  Guess it was all for the show....burn!",

Now understandably, this is not \"genuine\" Chinese food, but rather very decent \"americanized\" Chinese food. You will find the old take-out standbys here: Mongolian beef, lo mein noodles, hot & sour soup, etc. The decor has remained pretty much the same with its velvet red booths, dim lighting, and large mirrors. I wish the fireplace worked for those cold nights (wait, what cold nights?!? you know what I mean), and that they ran a duster over the windows. You receive free tea with your meal which is always a plus. I can't really comment on too many dishes as I only really get the Mu Shu which is delicious and they prepare it for you at the table.   The only bizarre thing I experienced here was when we ordered a large bowl of sweet and sour soup for the whole table but we couldn't finish it all, so we requested a to-go container for it. The waitress said they could not give it to us as a take home for some bizarre confusing reason we couldn't make out. Then she wanted to argue about it even though were were just going to let it go. It was like someone telling you that you can't take home buffet leftovers (which is understandable for obvious reasons), but this was not a free refillable menu item and we had paid for an entire large bowl. So we couldn't figure out what they were going to do with the soup, pour it out? Overall, I'll probably pop in here and there, but I will finish my soup next time! I recommend the hot pot, everyone loves cooking food at their table! The service, except for that one time, is always excellent.",

We ordered the wontons and they came only with cream cheese and plum sauce (similar to sweet and sour). I was hoping they would have had a little flavor, but they did not. Green onions would have made a huge difference!   The tangerine chicken was good. However, there were inedible pieces of orange peel and whole chilies on the plate. The sauce was very sweet with very little flavor. On a positive note, the chicken was all white meat and was large in portion.   My husband really liked his Singapore noodles. He even enjoyed the egg roll that came with my lunch special (I thought it was burnt and too greasy).   Overall, our experience was OK.",

They have the best wor wonton soup on the planet and great chicken lettuce wraps. Their walnut shrimp is phenomenal and pretty much, no matter what you get, you will be thrilled. All their food is fresh, and seasoned appropriately, and exactly what I want from the Chinese restaurant",

    "text": "My mom got a suggestion from one of her friends to come and eat at this place. We were feeling in a Chinese kind of mood, so we thought: what the heck?  I've never been to this place before, but I've passed it several times. I was excited to try something new and review another place.  As soon as we pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that there were a lot of people parked out front. I took that as a good sign.  We walked in to the restaurant and I was surprised at how nice it looked inside! I've been to several Chinese restaurants where inside has pink wall paper, and an assortment of Chinese-type figures all over, and out-dated look, with a huge fish tank in the \"wait-to-be-seated\" area. No, this one was pretty snazzy! Another plus.   We sit down and our waitress was very nice. She was very cordial, not too chatty. We ordered the honey dipped barbeque chicken and the cream cheese wontons for the appetizer. The chicken thing was good, but there was hardly any cream cheese in the wonton. It was almost just fried dough.   We ordered our entrees. Sweet and sour pork, chicken and another chicken plate. I thought that it would have come with rice (the menu said it did) but only the plate of egg rice came out (which we ordered).   The price was reasonable. Not too expensive. It was very filling too. The place was okay. It was better than a lot of other Chinese food places out there, but at the same time it was kind of the same. You know?   Anyway, I wouldn't rush back to this place. But I would tell others that it's got \"OK\" Chinese food.",

The building on the outside looks old and the half lit sign was not inspiring confidence, but I have been craving Chinese and my hubby and I always go past it it and stare curiously.  Lets be clear here, this is NOT an authentic, or anywhere close Chinese restaurant. This is a good old fashioned American Chinese joint, keeping that in mind we tried the Sweet and Sour Pork, Singapore Rice Noodles and Sauteed Shrimp.  The food came out FAST, I mean in 10 minutes after ordering we had our first dish on the table. It was hot and fresh, no rewarmed in the microwave junk. The pork was lovely, big chunks of tender battered pork in that great artificial red sauce which was tangy with just the right amount of sweet. The pork was accompanied by nice sized chunks of pineapple and green peppers that still had some crunch, not cooked to oblivion.  The Singapore Rice Noodles came in a huge portion, probably enough to feed 4 people. Perfectly done thin rice noodles with lots of shrimp and pork tossed together with a wonderful curry sauce. Not at all greasy or over sauced. We took more than half of the dish home for delicious leftovers.  The shrimp dish consisted of a good sized plate of very lightly battered shrimp sauteed with chili peppers and large cut green onions. It looks deceivingly simple but has wonderful flavor much light salt and pepper shrimp but with much less mess as they don't need to be peeled. The server asked us how hot we wanted the dish so we went with a 5/10, we ended up with a nice blend of flavor and heat that was a gentle medium for us.   The service was fast and friendly, the restaurant itself is very clean, it looks like it recently got a new coat of paint. Overall for the price the food is quite a good deal.  Oh yes in response to another Yelpers review in where he noted all the elderly in the restaurant and wondered if there was a retirement home in the area. Yes there are like 3 of them in very close proximity!",

The sesame chicken, which was featured in reviews, didn't seem particularly high quality and also lacked flavor. The egg rolls were \"meh\" rolls. At least the fortune cookie would be a saving grace, right? I took one bite and was disappointed. How does one eff up a fortune cookie? *shakes head* If MSG is a magic flavor enhancing sauce, they clearly don't use it.

Upon leaving the owner asked how was everything, I told her bad, she said \"oh sorry, guess you'll be looking for another place to eat\" lol. Not that I expected anything other more than that, Asians aren't actually known for their customer service to begin with.  Save your money, I'm not sure how this place has so many stars..I'm only giving 2 because my waiter was descent, otherwise they'd have a solid one - since zeros aren't allowed here.  It was a Friday night and the place was empty...that should have been my first sign to leave.",

Like a dumbass I kept eating it thinking that it was just a bad piece of chicken but then I looked and saw that the chicken looked a bit different, meaning white with no signs of it being fried at all.   All morning yesterday I had a fever and was vomiting.  When I got home from leaving work early, my son said he was sick too and had the same symptoms.  And that was all I ate because I have 2 protein shakes one for breakfast and one for lunch, and my son and I were the only ones who ate the chicken fried rice.  I dont know if it was contaminated or undercooked,  but please dont slack on cooking food thoroughly.",

I'm vegan, and I've been able to sort out how to order my favorite items with my favorite server to make sure they have no animal products in them. Spicy bean curd with water, not broth. It's to the point where I don't have to order - it's just \"the usual.\" That's wonderful, but it won't help any other vegans feel comfortable ordering. It would be great if they updated the menu to indicate what is, or could be made, vegan.  For instance, I know the bean curd soup can also be ordered with water instead of broth. It wouldn't change the great food they already serve, but it would open it up to new customers.",

Maybe I would be a happier customer if the dish wasn't called Singapore noodles, just stir fried rice noodles.",

The Mongolian beef is delicately sliced, very lean, flavorful, and melts in your mouth. My fellow \"yelpers\" this is Mongolian beef perfection. I couldn't find a single flaw, I just couldn't and now my mouth is watering.  Desert Jade has very affordable prices and the portions are great.  The staff is incredibly nice, friendly, gracious and accommodating and the service is second to none. In addition, Desert Jade offers terrific lunch and dinner specials.

I have so many favorite items but here are few must-tries: chicken lettuce wraps (I'd been eating these here looooong before so-called \"fusion\" joints like PF Chang's had them on their menu), sizzling rice chicken, sesame chicken, Desert Jade chow mein, honey-dipped chicken wings, any one of their delicious soups.

Whether you enjoy having an entree, for example the Walnut Shrimp or the Beef and Broccoli; or you are looking for an entire meal of appetizers, this is your place. The selections are endless and the flavors are incredible. It makes one feel comfortable to venture off the path and chose something new. I guarantee this establishment is worth the drive, wait, and traffic. My personal menu favorites are the Walnut Shrimp, Pot Stickers, Fried Wontons, Hot and Sour Soup, and the Sizzling Rice Soup.

    "text": "I've been coming to Desert Jade for 12+ years now and have had great experiences each time. The decor hasn't changed in all those years, looking more like a Scottish hunting lodge than a Chinese restaurant, which is always amusing. The restaurant is family owned and has been for 20+ years, with friendly waiters and some of the speediest service I have ever experienced. If you're hungry, this is the place to go to get your meal quickly.   They have a huge variety of items on the menu, but my favorites include the sizzling rice soup (the owner has told me the rice is fried daily and is always delicious!), and the chicken fruit salad to start off as appetizers. People always seem a little put off by the combo of chicken and fruit, but I promise it is one of the best things you'll try in the restaurant. The chicken lettuce wraps are refreshing, very tasty yet light. The lemon chicken is zesty, though a little heavy on the sauce, so make sure to mix it with your rice.   I really love supporting smaller, family owned places around the valley and Desert Jade has always been a gem.",

Good thing I didn't. I was surprised that they have pretty darn good food and the customer service was top notch. If I'm in the mood for Chinese in Phoenix, I'll definitely go back here.   The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because there's another Chinese place that is 1 star better than Desert Jade but I can't remember the freakin' name of the place. Nor what street it's on. Nor what it looks like. Damn those missing brain cells.",

I'm sorry, but I was NOT that impressed with the food here. I came here last night with a group of 6 people and we did the whole \"family style\" thing. A couple people ordered potstickers and said they were really good (and at least the waitress warned them that they would take 15 minutes to make) but others were not that impressed with the wonton soup.   My dish was actually pretty good (Ginger Chicken), but a couple of the other plates looked a little sketch (I mean, the Walnut Shrimp was literally a plate with shrimp, then a huge serving of broccoli and then a pile of walnuts....IT WASN'T EVEN MIXED IN!!) I was also disappointed with the \"fried rice\" they served with the meal, which was just fried with some soy sauce (no eggs, no veggies). The Mu Shu was ok, but I actually prefer the one at P.F. Chang's.   All in all, it wasn't horrible, but as the 2 Star rating indicates, I've DEFINITELY HAD BETTER!!   Almost three stars for great service, though!!!",

About a block away from Desert Jade, we could smell the unmistakable smell of Asian food, and our minds were made up.  As we walked in the door, we were greeted quickly and brought to our table immediately.  Hot tea and ice water were on the table in seconds.  We each ordered off the Kitchen Specials section of the menu, not knowing the portion size.  Faster than I had anticipated, we had two large plates of food on our table, and a bowl with a heaping portion of fried rice as our side.    As we ate, we couldn't decide which dish we liked better.  Both were amazingly fresh and meaty, with minimal breading (as it should be!) and maximum flavor.  While we both would've appreciated the sauces to be a bit thicker, they were not lacking.  After eating our fill (only about half), we took the rest home for a guaranteed excellent lunch tomorrow.  We will be back!",

Anyway, I agree with one of the other posters that this place seems kind of shady when you drive past it but don't judge a book by its cover.  The inside is a throwback to Chinese restaurants of the 70's...dimly-lit, plush-covered booths, stuffed birds in the window..you'll know what i'm talking about when you go inside.  Anyway the service was good and the food was just ok.  The lo mein had good flavor but was a bit greasy.  I think I just ordered the wrong thing, so we're going to give this place another chance.",

I was surprised that my Sesame chicken looked like a half of an entire chicken. It was pretty good & we did have a lot of food!!! The service was really good & we didn't have to ask for anything.

Our daughter, who lives in LA, has to have Desert Jade as soon as she gets to town for a visit. The service is top notch. They know their regulars. They know how their regulars want their meals prepared. I have been chided for always ordering the same thing, more or less, but at least they don't have to ask me. The decor is counter-intuitive, pleasant  enough, unexpected but doesn't detract. I think there is some variability in the cooking styles because this is a family-run business so chefs change and I notice sauces do have some variability. Still the spicy eggplant melts in your mouth. The moo shu pancakes are airy and the soup portions are to bathe in. The cost is also surprisingly low for the high quality. Most of you will not be disappointed.",

The potstickers were terribly bland. Plain meat in a dumpling, poorly pan fried. The sauce had no flavor. I'm pretty confident there was not an ounce of salt in anything . Beef with vegetables was supposed to be spicy...definitely not. Bland, over cooked possibly microwaved vegetables. The tangerine chicken we got for the kids was the only thing that had any kind of flavor in the sauce, but none of the meat offered was made tempura style. They sliced strips of chicken breast which hardly had any crispy coating.  There was no pride to the food here. We are not chain food eaters, but Panda and Pei Wei would have been significantly better choices.",

We decided to order Sweet and Sour chicken, Mongolian beef, chicken fried rice, and House Chop Suey (recommended by our waitress). I was looking for Hong Kong style chow mein but they didn't offer it.   The food was pretty good. Hubby said that its one of the best compared to his recent Chinese dining adventures. I really enjoyed the chicken fried rice. What I love about most Chinese establishments is that you always leave with a doggie bag, which of course we did. For around $50, our order would of fed 4 or 5 people (good value). We left full and satisfied.",

    "text": "Was in the area around dinner time and decided to try Desert Jade.  First, I checked Yelp and with an overall 4 star rating we decided to try it.   I was very happy that they served us free tea.  Yeah, that's right.  Free tea.  Nice!  I thought that was a sign of things to come.  We ordered the egg drop soup because it is my husband's favorite.  The \"small\"comes in a bowl which gave us each a cup of soup (the smaller cup they give you to serve yourself) and maybe another 1/2 cup.  The problem is that hubby hated it.  He said it was the worst he's ever had.  I say it was just OK but I wouldn't order it again.  BTW, if you want noodles, you have to pay 60 cents for noodles.  Their crispy noodles are like sticks not the wide ones usually served.  We tried the noodles and they were crispy and not greasy.  But why nickel and dime people?  Why not add it to the cost of the soup?  No other restaurant that I know charges for these.   We ordered one egg roll which was crispy and not greasy.  It was just veggies.  We both liked it. Hubby's meal was the Tangerine Chicken, ordered spicy.  This dish came out looking good, but the chicken was over cooked.  The flavor on the sauce was orangey and good.  I think the reason for the chicken being overcooked is that they use a rotisserie chicken and then added slices of the rotisserie chicken into the sauce.  The way the chicken was sliced led me to believe that.  Most orange chicken or even General Tso's chicken is in chunks--not slices of chicken that are still linked to one another.  Do you get what I am saying?    It was like taking the side of a chicken and putting slits in it and then dropping it in an orange sauce.  All I heard was complain about this meal all evening.  Yap, Yap, Yap.... The chicken is over cooked, the chicken is overcooked... Yap, yap, yap.  Will never come here again... Yap, yap, yap.  Ladies,  you get it,  right?    My dish was tofu with ground pork.  I asked for it spicy and they really, really gave it to me spicy.  Well, I asked for it and that's what I deserved.  It was a tasty dish and I would have it again but I don't think that's going to happen because hubby was not happy with his dish and we are probably never visiting Desert Jade again.  BTW,  if you want brown rice you pay 35 cents per person.  Again with the nickel and diming.    Well, you know how I arrived at the two stars.  One for the free tea and one for my dish which was spicy but very acceptable.  I have definitely experienced better!",

Those talking about long waits - there is a reason - people love this food. Long waits usually mean lots of customers - usually means the product is great. In this case it is. We get the Bo Bo plater - basically a sampler - great. Sesame chicken is the family favorite so they order double. I love the mu shu pork. They also do take - takout orders.

When our order arrived the juice had spilled all over the plastic bag that it was in. And by spilled I mean pooled in the bottom, it was significant. We ordered the cream cheese rangoons and they were terrible - the worst I have ever had. The first one I bit into had zero cream cheese (literally) and the remaining had a smudged of cold cream cheese that looked like it just came out of the container.   For dinner we had the Mongolian beef and garlic chicken with mushrooms. Both were delicious. However, I am a huge Rangoon fan and as pathetic as it sounds, I won't be back for that reason. There are way too many great Chinese places in Phoenix to only be enjoying half my meal.",

I have never dined in, only gotten take out, but they are extremely pleasant when you go in to pick up the food and the restaurant seems nice inside. Food is consistently delicious, fresh, with quality ingredients.  We've gotten past the no-delivery, but major downside is not being open on Sunday (our usual takeout night)! We broke down and tried our old place last Sunday and it was nowhere near as good... Until they change hours, we'll be forgoing Chinese Sundays! Desert Jade is the best!!",

I've never had a bad meal here and take friends here. I think it's great. I wish it were open on Sundays. That's a bit of a bummer.  They have great almond cookies. We usually get moo Shu chicken, which is very flavorful. I have also had them be very accommodating and make me steamed foods with brown rice. I just love this place!",

We have always found the service friendly, wether eating in or getting carry-out, and they have never refused to do a special order for us. (I don't like mushrooms- what?)  We have been coming here for more than 10 years now and the food is still great.  Try the pan fried tofu with vegetables... the ginger chicken... the shrimp with lobster sauce... to name a few.",

I've lived in this same neighborhood for about 8 years now and driven by Desert Jade a thousand times and never really noticed it. (Kind of like ALL of those places on Indian School!)  But, we decided to get adventurous and try it.   And it was really pretty good!  As you walk in, it looks like your typical Chinese restaurant. Red pleather booths, paper lanterns kinda thing.   We were lead to a booth by the window which had some kind of tableau in it featuring big fake turkeys (not the cooked kind... the real kind)... So, don't know what that was all about.   One problem I noticed first... No Asian people eating in the restaurant. A clue to me when eating any kind of ethnic food. If you see people native to the type of food you're about to eat, it's a GOOD sign!  I ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup first. As the waitress was putting the Sizzling Rice into my soup at the table, she dropped one of the big clumps into my water. No matter. She was sweet and we all laughed.   The soup was really quite good. As was the Moo Shu Pork (that they made at the table. I'm used to assembling the crepes myself) and also the Kung Pao.   I'll definitely be back, Desert Jade! Thanks for a great Chinese meal!",

A well cooked and flavored skirt steak as opposed to the rubbery crap most places serve. Everything was great. Just when I was starting to lose faith in going out anymore. Service was great too. Went in Saturday the 27th and evryone was nice and helpful with the menu. Manager or owner made space for my son's carseat. Very cool, highly recommend. Oh and great booth too.",

Let's start off with the front desk, rude!!! not welcoming the person standing there was on their cell phone and when I asked for a table it was like fine I'll get you one.   We sat down expecting a great dinner and instead we got bland flavorless food. The appetizers were burnt like really burned my broccoli beef had no beef the rice had no flavor not to mention the server pretty much tossed down the food on our table.  They made us feel like we were troubling them. This is not the place to go with your family this is not the place to order out. The people running this restaurant should really consider what type of business they're in.  I don't like writing negative reviews like this but it must be said.  Restaurants have strong competition it's only a matter of time before word gets out that this place is just awful.",

    "text": "Like most Chinese, if you dont order a bit of everything then you will be let down. Desert Jade is one of those places that unless you order five dishes, then the food ends up tasting bland and unappetizing after a few bites. However its fantastic if you order a bit of everything and have a few bites between returning to a dish.  This time around I tried the manderin chicken (orange chicken) which was crispy, sweet, and very tasty, especially mixed with my boyfriend's ginger chicken which was light, tasty, and aromatic.  Among other dishes that were ordered were Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken (which they were wonderfully accomadating on and gave the sweet and sour sauce on the side), pork fried rice, barbeque pork, and many other dishes. All were served hot and between 8 people almost all dishes were devoured.   Every time I come here is a bit different, when its the whole family everything is delicious, when its just my boyfriend and I everything seems to be a let down. Which is a shame because the restaurant itself is very lovely, it would be a perfect date spot if we could figure out two dishes that go well together without having to order five things to satisfy our pallets.  They do serve complementary hot tea which is light and refreshing, also they have very good pot stickers. Their parking lot is huge and they easily accomodate large groups. In fact they're a bit of a let down otherwise! But the food is good and the portions are massive, service is a bit cold but everything else is hot.   I generally dont suggest this place to anyone since there is way better Chinese around town but I would say, give it a try if you're looking for something close to where you live, and give the Mongolian beef a try because it is very good.",

They remember their regulars by name and ask about your family members and/or friends (especially my mom awwwww). They are genuinely heart warming & sweet.   I have been coming here for almost 20 years. Wow that's a while!  So I must really love this place & the family that runs it.  Plus they are funny & they joke around with me for years about my lack of driving & taking cabs there unless with family or friends (must have my cravings satisfied haha).   Some of the servers have been there a while so they know I like my food spicy & no carrots even if I might forget to say. I don't like to waste food. So they will make most of their dishes to your preference since it's made fresh.  Just ask.   Great Food!  Great Service!  Always fresh ingredients and no msg. Always consistently delicious!  Simple Chinese food done well!!",

Pepper Chicken, sweet & sour chicken (sauce on the side) and an order of Dumplings.  I will give them credit the dumplings were great and so was the white rice.  The S&S chicken was just over fried over breaded chicken if it had chicken in each little nugget.  The pepper chicken had little to no flavor, and soggy veggies.  I did some how receive an extra order of what I think was teriyaki chicken, thought it was wrong and realized I was charged for it on the receipt. No big deal who doesn't spend $50 for Chinese food? Seriously, I always do. Sadly, it wasn't good either. If it's between this place or Panda, pick Panda. It will taste better, and be cheaper.",

Chicken was over cooked, dry and breading had burnt taste to it on some pieces. I couldn't even finish eating all of my meal. I was a little disappointed since all of the reviews on this place seemed to be really good.  Maybe it was a one off and not a typical visit, however I do not know if I will return to try again. Or if I do, maybe I will try a different entree. I had the tangerine chicken.",

Once i got home with my order my plate was full of mixed vegetables.... CARROT, CELERY, GREEN ONION, REGULAR ONION... ALL DICED UP MIXED IN MY FOOD. The owner told me that the new employee doesnt know the menu yet but that it is my fault for not saying \"the person doesnt like vegetables\" GIVE ME A BREAK! I ASKED FOR NO VEGETABLES! I ask for a refund & she said she had to write down my credit card number, CVV, and name. Then she says she will do the refund another time when she has time because they are busy... I just picked up food and it was empty with only 1 customer seated inside. Again, just dont go here unless you want people to tell you you are the reason their staff is poorly trained. Crossing my fingers I dont have credit card fraud after asking to be refunded...",

We went for a nice family dinner here and were relying on the favorable reviews; however, we were vastly disappointed with what Desert Jade had to offer.   It was obvious from the appetizers that something was off. The wonton soup was watery and not seasoned at all. The fried shrimp was almost burnt, and the bbq pork ribs were boiled with no flavor.  The tangerine beef was leathery with a thin coating of burnt breading; the Kung pao chicken had pieces of barely recognizable \"chicken\", and the chicken lettuce wraps were mostly egg and rice noodles.   What was most disappointing was the reaction we received when we provided feedback to the restaurant. First we spoke to the server who called my husband a \"kid\".  Then the manager, an elderly woman, was extremely rude and belligerent, stating, \"you don't like the food, don't come back.\" Most assuredly, we will not.   If I could, I would give Desert Jade zero stars. Alas, one star is as low as it can go.",

There was maybe a half of teaspoon of the cream  cheese mixture and a wrapper about an inch and a half. Way too much wrapper with absolutely no filling. The sauce with it was great, added with hot mustard was awesome. The lemon chicken barely had sauce on it. With it being to go, sauce should be on the side because the breading on the chicken became soggy. Not even good for leftovers because the breading just fell off due to sitting in sauce for 2 days. Lady at the desk was nice and they didnt forget anything (hot mustard, soy sauce and fortune cookies)",

The walnut shrimp was hilarious: a few shrimp in a soggy coating tossed with what looked like tooth paste with a few steamed broccoli and  a couple of clumps of candied walnuts.  Seriously run away. Waste of over $60. Not to mention the indigestion to follow",

After separating the beef and onions and incorporating the appropriate amount of onion that an onion lover like me would want I ate everything but the pile of onion on the plate.   During my meal no one checked on me, and they check on most of the other tables, so I couldn't say anything without getting up from the table. When the lady came to take my plate she commented that there was a lot of onion! I said yes there was and it felt like I was paying for $10 worth of onion. She walked away while laughing about the amount of onion.   Someone else brought my check, and I paid. On the way out I saw the lady who served me and I nicely let her know that the amount of onion was seriously too much. She said she already told them in back, and hen told me how much beef cost per pound,\"almost $10 per pound!\" She continued to laugh in my face and I tried to explain that this doesn't help me in this situation. Again she kept laughing it off when I said I would probably never return.   She wished me well and hoped that I'd find a restaurant that I liked.  What!?!? Just absolutely terrible.",

Desert Jade made almost all of its dishes with gluten free soy sauce so I was able to order a wide variety.  It was really good food and excellent service.  The hot sour soup was some of the best I have ever had,and I have had it all over the country.  The sizzling rice shrimp was also superior.

It is the best non-dim sum Chinese food in central Phoenix, since the now long departed Silver Dragon (I think, off of Northern) closed.   Pan-fried noodles are excellent, so are mixed Chinese vegetables. This is the really nice feature for me: Desert Jade is incredibly accommodating about substitutions. I get shrimp,chicken,pork, beef combo with broccoli, but without the pork and beef, and substituting string beans for broccoli. This (and similar requests) never cause any sort of problem at Desert Jade. Hot tea is loose leaf, no tea bags, which is another positive for me.  My companion Mr. Super Spicy gets his usual gin-and-tonic and says it is adequate. He assures me that dishes marked for spiciness are indeed up to his standards, and that beef with broccoli is decent, with lean but tender meat. He likes the pork fried rice (LOTS of pork) and says egg foo yung is good too. Wor Wan Ton soup is full of tasty morsels, not merely thin broth and droopy noodles.  The ambiance at Desert Jade is a bit odd, it's very comfortable, mind you, but more like a hunting lodge than any Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Clean forest green velvet upholstered booths, diamond shaped mullioned windows, scenes of pheasants and grouse, etc.  The bar near the front entrance is charming, and more traditional. Also, this restaurant is open until 9:30pm, quite unusual for Phoenix dining!",

My grandma might not have eaten this in China but it is damn good regardless. But I digress- Try it. You like it.   We also got the barbecue pork with veggies. I like snow peas and there were also baby carrots, bean sprouts, and carrots. I thought it was great.   If you like spicy- ask for the chili oil. I like it on everything.   To address some of the reviews that made reference to it being expensive. I don't know where Chinese food go the reputation of being cheap. Maybe it was from all the buffets scattered throughout the state. But Chinese food isn't 'that' cheap when going to a decent sit down type place. Our tab was about $35 for 2 people.

I found Desert Jade, which is near my office, and which I've driven past a thousand times, but which I've never tried.  So I called in an order for a hot and sour soup and an egg roll, and went to pick it up.    I walked up to the cashier (who was the only person in the front area) and stood there as she feverishly went about scanning credit cards.  I stood there for about 5 minutes with absolutely no acknowledgment from her that I was standing there.  It was like a game to me -- let's see how long I can stand here without being acknowledged.  Then an older white man who had dined in the restaurant steps up to the cashier and puts his check down to pay for it and -- I'm not kidding here -- she picks up his check and charges his card STILL without acknowledging that I was standing there.  It was not until after she finished checking him out that she turned to me with a smile on her face and asked how she could help me.  Really?  Hmm, let me think.  I wanted to say she could help me by not being completely rude and disrespectful, but I just simply told her that I had placed an order over the phone and was there to pick it up.  Once she actually acknowledged me, she was very pleasant, but everything before that was completely unacceptable.    The soup and egg roll were actually pretty good, but the service was beyond terrible, and actually entered into the world of being a tad bit racist.  I was offended, and for that reason, I won't be going back to Desert Jade anytime soon.",

    "text": "I read the awesome reviews on this site, therefore my expectations were high. After all, Phoenix is plagued with AWFUL Chinese restaurants.   Our entire dinner was bland. The sauce that accompanied the Fried Wontons was insipid and flavorless. Red, thick sauce should be sweet. This was not. Unimpressed. The pot stickers were ok, but nothing special enough to write home about.  I was leery about ordering the Tangerine Beef, because I had a rancid dish of the same name from a different Chinese restaurant a couple years ago. Thought I'd give it a go. Bland. Beef pounded into oblivion smothered with a sauce so faint that it cried for flavor.   The Sesame Chicken, bland as well, was overcooked and nowhere near as sweet as one should like.  The Kung Pao Chicken was the least amusing dish of all. No flavor, no heat, and no veggies.   The Mu Shu Pork was ok, but the plum sauce was, again, bland!  Now, the cleanliness and presentation of the restaurant was in face phenomenal. Very clean and the lit candles on the tables were a very nice touch.  The service was legendary. Very chipper, friendly, and at times amusing. There was an older lady whose job apparently was to take dirty dishes from the tables and only says \"thank you!\" when she does anything near you.  I noticed that a great many of the diners were very elderly. Is there a retirement village nearby? Do you not realize that the elderly LOVE buffets and bland food? This restaurant was full of both, and I think it was the army of elderly people with diminishing taste buds who wrote all those glowing reviews.  I understand that people have varying opinions and tastes, but come on! Raise your standards and start asking yourself if the food you are tasting really deserves FOUR or FIVE stars? Fail.",

We typically order lettuce wraps, and sizzling rice soup to start. Then a few entrees for everyone to share. I think we have tried the whole menu! I used to order certain items to be a dick.. like the worst sounding stuff on the menu, but the joke was on me because many of them became family favorites (hint: you MUST get the asparagus). All the food we've ordered was fresh. Wait staff is always on point. The prices are more than reasonable. Best Chinese food I've had. Nobody else is even in the same ballpark. I am not sure what those few people who left poor reviews were on.. probably meth. I imagine them eating lots of kraft mac n cheese with cut up hotdog in it, and a side of ketchup.. They just don't know quality. DJ till I die bitch-",

It's a lovely restaurant with great decor and atmosphere (you can hardly tell you're on Indian School). The service was great; the waiters are friendly (they were happy to chat with patrons and make suggestions) and I have to say it: they speak English better than most places. Most important the food was just what you like about Chinese without the little faults it usually has. All the meat and vegetables were fresh and whole without being overlooked or drowned in sauce.  Tangerine chicken, for instance, is usually little balls of dark meat heavily breaded and soggy with sugary sauce. Here, it's nice cuts of breast lightly coated in a still-crispy shell with just enough of a very flavorful sauce that can be adjusted to your taste. Vegetables were crisp, tea was hot, and dinner was great. I highly recommend this place.",

I was invited to lunch here by a colleague who had dined here many times in the past.  I felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced, given the quantity and quality of food.  i ordered the kung pao shrimp ($8.25), which was a spicy dish, but ordered it HOT.  It came so mild I might as well have ordered shrimp in lobster sauce, with some peanuts thrown in.   There were about 10 peanuts, a 1/2 cup of sauteed green onions, and about 4 medium sized shrimp, to go with fried rice that had nothing in it and an egg roll the size of my thumb.  It WAS nice it came with hot tea.  Was it outrageously priced?  Absolutely not.  Would I eat here again if someone invited me?  Of course.  But if it's my choice, there are much better Chinese restaurants to be found.",

I ordered my food to go, so when I arrived to pick it up, I stood in front of the guy at the counter for at least two minutes. He didn't look up or acknowledge me whatsoever. He was going through all of the orders so far from that night. It would have been one thing if they were getting ready to close, but it was about 7:30 and they were open for two more hours. Finally, after standing there staring at him and feeling really uncomfortable, I interrupted him to tell him I was there to pick up an order. He looked annoyed, asked my name, and then told me what I owed. There were two to go orders sitting on the counter and he didn't even tell me which one was mine. After I paid, he went right back to doing what he was doing before, so I had to ask him which one was mine. I got home and enjoyed the items that were ordered. The jade fried rice (delicious and full of meat), king pao dual (great flavor, spicy, big shrimp), and the tangerine chicken. Tangerine chicken was good, but my least favorite of the three. If I decide to go back, I hope their employees actually decide to greet and acknowledge their customers this time. Customer service goes a long way in my book.",

He got me Sauteed Asparagus and for himself Sauteed Pork.  I was glad he got \"sauteed\" dishes thinking they would not be fried and more healthy. Turns out Sauteed means fried at Desert Jade.  My asparagus was a carton shaped block of breaded and fried asparagus; Which would have been fine if a group wanted to split as an appetizer, but it was sold as a \"House Special\" with rice.  And cost $12!  I plopped it out of the box and went to the kitchen to try to figure out what to cook to make a meal.  Who would eat just one type or vegetable, breaded and fried, with white rice?! The Sauteed Pork was fried pork in a sauce with limp green onion leaves, not the nice crunchy part. And was fine, but small portion, so he ended up eating some of the frozen pot stickers from Trader Joe's that I \"sauteed\".  Both dishes were listed as \"spicy hot dishes\" and neither were spicy; and I have a relatively low spicy tolerance so if I say it has no spice, it has NO spice.   On the other hand Trader Joe's has great frozen pot-stickers and bottled sweet and sour spicy sauce.  My only other visit was for when i was craving Wanton Soup.  The wantons were supper small and dense and not flavorful. The broth was nice, but the vegetables also included the surprise mushrooms. I've never had mushrooms in wanton soup, and if I had I would have known, I'd ordered without.  (My bf is allergic and I worry about giving him an allergic reaction from kissing, and I like kissing!)",

It was very reminiscent of the Chinese food that I grew up with in New York. After a couple of years of not going to the restaurant, we decided to try it again last night. Very disappointing! The service was terrible. The place was empty,  so there was no excuse for that.  I ordered roast pork appetizer.  I  thought the menu said that it would come as ribs, but, no, it was just sliced roast pork that was absolutely tough and tasteless. I had to put the sweet and sour sauce that was on the table on top of the pork, which should not be necessary.  The sauce was watered down. I then ordered the chicken that was breaded in an egg wash and deep-fried on top of vegetables. The sauce that came with this dish was tasteless and again I was very disappointed. My friend ordered chicken with cashew nuts and I tasted her dinner, as well. Even her cashews had no flavor them. I don't know who owns this restaurant now,  ut it can't be owned by he same family or descendants who originally owned Desert Jade. Needless to say, we won't be going back.",

The pan fried noodles are perfectly crispy and delicious. The sizzling rice soup (my new fave item) is flavorful and the veggies in it taste fresh. They still have the husband's favorite sweet and sour chicken (made with chicken that is fried and then sliced... that makes all the difference). The service is still great, in fact, we have been coming to Desert Jade for almost 10 years now and many of the staff members are the same, which is very cool. On top of that, they remember you, have personal conversations with you, and remember your order. You really can't beat the service. Additionally, the food never takes more than 15 minutes to come out. Other notable dishes are the pot stickers (made in house, not my fave in town, but a good solid effort), the spicy red sauce (yummm), and the lettuce wraps. Definitely check them out!  PS They still provide hot tea to the table, a nice touch, but they stopped the almond cookies.... this is sort of heartbreaking... bring back the almond cookies pleeease!!!",

Another lady greeted us and took us to our table.  A gentleman brought us hot tea and cold water to our table right away, and then we were greeted by our waitress Rose.  Good team work going on at this place.    I have never been to a nice Chinese place before.  This was a really nice one and I was super excited to see how the food would taste.  While enjoying my hot tea (BEST TEA EVER!  it was PERFECT), I glanced over the menu.  The prices are very decent and they have many different dishes to choose from.    We started with an order of fried wantons.  These were light, airy, slightly crispy, delicate and filled with a little bit of cream cheese.  They came with sweet and sour sauce, which was the best sweet and sour sauce I've ever had.  Nice bright red orange color, sweet and tangy and not thick or to thin, just right.  Very good start to a grand meal that I had no idea was about to come.  Rose moved our fried wantons' plate out of the way and put two large plates in front of us.  She then started bringing out our food.  We had sweet and sour pork, pan fried noodles, fried rice, and sesame chicken.  Sesame chicken was at least two large oh so TENDER chicken breasts crisped to perfection in thick dark onion sauce that I soaked my rice and noodles in.  Pan fried noodles were lightly oiled and tasted like they were fried in a wok, very tasty.  The fried rice was fresh, soft and fluffy.  The sweet and sour pork was smothered (NOT soggy) in their yummy sweet and sour sauce.  It included large chunks of pineapples, green bell peppers and onions.  Every portion was enough for two to three people to share or even save for the next day (see photos), BUT it is going to be so hard from stopping yourself enjoying your hot fresh food in such a romantic dark setting (music overhead was a love song station).    We had so much to pack up, Rose came by and put it all up for us in boxes.  She was awesome, very sweet, and always came by to check on us to see how we were doing.    For everything we got -not- including tip was ONLY $34.  Forget the buffets, this is the place to go.  I highly recommend this place for large groups, couples, events, and anyone else who loves Chinese Food.  It's the BEST I EVER HAD!",

This place, as noted, is a two dollar sign, but it is exactly that distinction that sets it apart from other restaurants like this. Like Mexican restaurants in the area, there are roughly four thousand places you could get American Chinese cuisine. They range in price and this is probably the high end as far as this type of cuisine goes, but the tangerine chicken will make you forget about the eleven bucks that it costs. This place was a nice reminder that spending an extra four bucks for your meal is usually worth it, especially when you are going to take to the Internet to tell others about it.   Also the egg rolls was mad crispy.",

The woman at the front who took our order was so so polite. And I dont just mean polite, I mean GENUINELY polite. She explained how some items we ordered were made a bit different than other places, and brought a piece of the (orange) chicken out to taste. Id say 8 minutes later, barely enough time for me to catch up on Facebook, our food was ready to go. Nicely packaged to take out. She showed me how to eat the lettuce wraps since it was all packaged separately (I knew how but it was still nice of her).  So...the food. BEST EGG DROP SOUP AWARD. EVER. Seriously. This may seem minor but I am a soup lover.  and chicken lettuce wraps...amazing. The rest of the food we ordered between the 2 of us was all great.  I foresee a problem here. This will turn into a weekly visit",

    "text": "I enjoy coming for lunch, although I no longer work around the area, I still commute across Phoenix to eat here once in a while when the craving hits. I have never been here for dinner but the prices look steep for Chinese food. They have the best tangerine chicken and that's the only thing I have ever ordered. The have cut back on portions over time but there's still enough to get full but not enough for leftovers for dinner like before. You also get a free pot of hot tea with your order. My only complaint is the waitress. There seems to be only 2, a guy and a lady. The guy is always nice and attentive but unfortunately we always seem to get the lady. She is not too friendly so we always just brushed it off as a cultural thing but the last time we were there she didn't even take our drink order. I guess we were fine with that since we ended up drinking water but the whole situation was just awkward since it has never happened to us before. We just feel as if she wants us out as soon as possible. They also box your leftovers for you which I also find awkward but I can live with that. Yes, this place does look like a retirement center at lunch time and I took a picture to proof it. (There were tons more seniors next to and behind us) We are always the youngest couple and can actually feel our youth being sucked out of us. This does not take away the fact they have delicious orange chicken and will continue to sacrifice my youth once in a while for its yummy crunchiness.  P. s. I don't know if kids are allowed there, I have never seen them in there and they don't have a kids menu",

    "text": "\"2 stars for disappointing food, one star for great service.\"  Had I read Iain B's review prior to my dinner at Desert Jade the other night, I could've saved us $46.    Instead, my husband and future yelper sister Alexa M and I headed down Indian School road in search for some decent Chinese food.  We were all pretty hungry and it was my bright idea to try a new place.  We passed by Shanghai Chinese and actually pulled into the parking lot of another restaurant (maybe China Village?) but decided since the parking lot was close to empty, that was not a good sign.  So, somehow we ended up at Desert Jade.  Ivan was our server and he was fantastic.  I just wish I could say the same about the food...   Unfortunately, the egg drop soup, Kung Pao Vegetables, Spicy Chicken, and Beef and Asparagus dishes were nothing to write home about... all were mediocre.  Next time, I'll go to one of our regular spots instead... or at the very least, I'll check the Yelp reviews before wasting time and money.  You live and learn... they cannot all compete with Tottie's or Jade Palace!",
