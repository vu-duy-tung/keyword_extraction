I suggest making a reservation if you can because on Monday and Tuesday nights they have a $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta board special after 8pm and every weekday they have happy hour of $5 pitchers of beer or glasses of wine until 5pm. Great lunch spot for sandwiches and salads (I think they have lunch special for those like half and half) and great meet up spot with friends or a date for wine and bruschetta at night.",

They really didn't seem to know what was going on",

Ours was great BUT I wish I had another two or three to choose from.   Bruschetta? You want it? They have it. Four people in your group? Get a Butcher's Block and one Bruschetta. A bottle (or two) of wine? Perfect night. Park around back for easier parking spots. The walk will give you time to realize on the way out you should probably Uber home",

My gf and her fiance and I came to this location a few weeks ago and had a horrible time across the board, I never leave yelp reviews but had such a bad experience that I decided to write one. Within a few days the GM of the restaurant reached out to me and apologized and asked us to come back. Last night (Friday) we did. We were on track for another mediocre night when I decided to write the gm via yelp and let him know our second time in wasn't going much better than the first. Within a few minutes the manger on duty came over asked for Michelle (me) and wanted to know what was going on and wanted to hear about our experience. I thought it was really impressive how the managers really cared about our experience and are working to make it better! I will be back thanks to Tim, Jenna and our server Brandon! Thank you for working hard to make this location reach up to its potential and listening to your guests.",

For Bruschetta, we ordered one Brie and Apple with Fig Spread, one Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, one Salami with Pesto, and one Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato.

I had to wave my arms to get their attention to get water. Our food plates sat in front of us until we left. Bartenders never asked if we wanted more food or if we were finished. The couple next to us complained about their service also. Sadly, I won't be back.",

If you are gluten sensitive/celiac the gf bread is delicious.   Their caramel ice cream dessert is a must.   Service was friendly and cheerful but it was also slow and lacking.",

This location also has MAJOR leak problems, as we experienced on our second visit last weekend during a monsoon rainstorm.  We told multiple bartenders who clearly did not care, as when we were leaving there was a HUGE puddle inside, which was a hazard for guests who were unaware.  Unfortunately, we were all TOO aware as my date and I were sporadically rained on the entire time we were there.  We actually considered popping open our umbrella, but didn't want to cause (too much of) a scene.  So, we left.  At least when I told a hostess that people will probably fall, she appeared concerned.",

She was about to sit us outside when she was interrupted by the guy \"who seemed like a manager\" and he said no you cannot put them out there we have a lot of people in front of them, which there was just one couple outside by the entrance waiting. The \"manager\" said we can wait 30 minutes or go to the bar. When walking around the bar and there were no seats. And no one around to help.......

I have always had exceptional service, however at Postino Highland I unfortunately did not have a good customer service experience. Our waitress was extremely rude and very unwelcoming. Didn't say more than 2 words to me and my friend the whole time. She didn't even come over once to ask if we needed anything or how our food was. I will most likely not be returning to this location, and go to Postino Central where i've always received amazing service. Still giving Postino 4 stars because of their great food, but taking one star off for the bad service.",

It's not unlike other Postino locations, amazing food and good selection of wines and beers. Great for large groups, brunch, outdoor patio, kid friendly, huge couch available for large groups, and amazing happy hour with large bar. Can't wait for fall to take advantage of the outdoor space even more.",

My husband and I got the bruschetta (highly recommend!) and a meat and cheese plate. He was very impressed with his five dollar picture of beer as it was a great deal! The pricing is well worth the food that you receive and when ordering the bruschetta you will be excited and overwhelmed with all the amazing combinations you get to choose from. The atmosphere is also a fun bonus with its industrial mid century modern look.",

I kept raving to my girlfriends how bomb the bruschetta is here so we stopped by before heading back to California.  This was my first time at this location and it was much better than the one I first went to in Phoenix.  Love how bright and open this location is and all the cute decor inside.  Perfect spot for any type of occasion!   We each ordered our own bruschetta boards and a cup of their soup of the day which was roasted red pepper w/gouda.   For my bruschetta board I chose: -Brie & apples w/ fig spread -Fresh mozzarella w/tomato & basil -Smoked salmon w/pesto -Proscuitto w/figs & mascarpone  The soup was surprisingly much better than expected!  I would definitely recommend getting a cup :)  Now the bruschettas.. They were all sooooooo goood. The Brie & apples one is more the on sweeter side but still one of my favs  and you can never go wrong with smoked salmon or prosciutto!  My least favorite was the fresh mozzarella because they used way too much basil.  I tried to eat as much as I could but I couldn't finish the entire board. We definitely over-ordered but no regrets here! I will be back.",

The decor looked cute driving by so I decided to check it out with the promise of delicious flatbreads and good wine. The glass of wine i had i admit was good. However - I do have a severe dairy allergy and told the staff assuming they could easily accommodate me and simply not use butter or cheese on my flatbread as they have 100 other fresh ingredients and olive oil as a substitute. I was told immediately by a server that they couldn't accommodate me in any way and there was NOTHING I could eat essentially except settling for an olive plate with some charcuterie meats. I was really disappointed that the server didn't seem to double check that they were correct that there really was no flatbread option they could give to me. She seemed like she just wanted to get off her shift and had no time for me. i even had a tiny bite of my olive and meat tray and even that made me instantly have an allergic reaction - my eyes swelled up and it was difficult to breathe obviously my night was ruined.",

My favorites are the salmon pesto, prosciutto mascarpone and bacon burrata. The Apple Brie option is great as a dessert to end your bruschetta board. They have an excellent deal on Monday and Tuesday nights, a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20. What you don't finish they will recork and you can take it home!",

My girlfriend and I came for a light lunch here on Sunday and it could not have been a better experience! We found two seats at the bar and sat there.   Let me back up and say that this location itself is absolutely gorgeous. I love love love all the natural light and decor that takes place in this environment. The interior design gives such a classy and elegant feel without aging it.    One grand thing: $5 until 5pm for wine. This was an incredible revelation that I discovered. I ordered the sparkling Rose which was not sweet,but had the perfect amount of happiness to it !    As for lunch itself, Postino gives the option to choose a \"Pick Two\" sorta thing. I chose the half prosciutto and Brie panini with a chicken raspberry salad.  Both of these choices were absolutely superb!    So to be clear, Postino left me planning for the next time I can stop by. Cannot wait !!  Thank you so much!",

The event coordinator Natalie was amazing, so knowledgeable and helpful, guiding us with types and quantity of food and beverage for 40+ guests.  She really is experienced. The food was fabulous, the ambiance was magical - string lights overhead, fireplace,  candles and we brought in flowers for the tables and rented white linen table cloths.  The weather was perfect for it and the guests were wowed!  We got compliments all night long and throughout the weekend.  My son and his bride said it couldn't have possibly been any better!  It had a sophisticated but relaxed vibe,  a perfect ice breaker to kick off the wedding weekend . The bartender and wait staff were amazing. And it was a LOT more affordable than the other places we checked into.",

The bruschetta was delicious and the pub board was tasty as well and our wine was very good. We knew we had to go back the next day. So we headed down the next day for brunch. There was a little bit of a wait so we got a glass of wine at the bar and then headed to our table for a delicious breakfast, bruschetta, and more wine. Raul the manager was so friendly and welcoming and the service was as good as it was the night before. He informed us of Postino's catering options and we look forward to utilizing them for our next event. Such a fun place, highly recommend!",

My waitress came by frequently to check on us and I had a very pleasant conversation with a gentlemen named Raul.  He recommended 2  very good wines and after a sample of each i couldn't decide which one i wanted because both complimented my plate nicely.  After a conversation with him I decided to go with a red that he recommended.  I could not have been more satisfied with the food and service at this location. If you love wine and plates that compliment, i HIGHLY recommend this place.  The staff is very welcoming, the food and wine selection is perfect, and the comfort level is extraordinary.",

We got management because like we said waitress never came back told them food cold etc. but more importantly one did not get meal. Got new meals again .  Hoping for better NOPE the same and the Walnut bread with preservers dry cold and bland even the preserves no flavor. The finale no comp on drinks or any meal even the one that we didn't get!  Waste of money waste of precious time.  Go to the Breakfast Club you won't be disappointed!",

I told her I was here for the experience and to sit me in the best  possible spot...or a table that had atmosphere so she sat me outside by the fire which was beautiful! My server's name was Mark and he was exceptional! He welcomed me immediately and asked me all the right questions in order to make the best suggestions for food choices. He was so informative, and probably one of the best servers I've ever had! If you are a wine lover, please sit in his section because he is studying to be a sommelier....and he is so interesting and informative...I learned a lot from him...and he makes the best suggestions....because I loved everything I ordered! The bruschetta was amazing!..  bruschetta is a big deal here Scottsdale apparently... I only ate a few restaurants so far and they all featured bruschetta!  The salad with a brussel sprouts was so incredible! Tori, the manager delivered my food and she made me feel so welcome!

The wine selection is robust and their Italian negroamaro red pairs nicely with their Italian themed dishes. When in Rome...or Scottsdale...  Great setup with bar area with misters and decent patio.  A lot of open air and natural lighting.    Only knock is no Mexican beer options and bartenders need to look up more and be attentive. Once you have their attention all is great.",

The atmosphere is so cozy and sweet, they even play great music. Our server was so nice I'm totally going to butcher the spelling of her name I'm sure but it started with an A and ended with an A. Please forgive me but I was drinking wine.  I'm only rating 4 stars because our bruschetta took 50 minutes to come out.. They handled it very professionally though, the manager even brought out a hummus plate that was SOGOOD!! It was cooked cold veggies with a side of hummus and ranch dips. If you like hummus plates you haveeeee to try this one. We were instantly in a better mood. :)  The bruschetta I think actually first almost dropped to the wrong table and then wasn't caught right away. We understand that stuff happens but can't really mess with me when I'm hungry!  Overall will DEFINITELY be back this place is awesome!",

I placed an order to go then headed back to the salon to shampoo a few clients while we waited on food. I went back about 15 minutes later and the food still wasn't there yet. I think if it weren't for the fact that I was also picking up food for clients, I wouldn't have been so incredibly anxious about how long it was taking, but we're talking about the comfort and welfare of my own clients here as well. After maybe a 30 minute wait on top of the previous 15 minute one, my food finally came and I was about to call off Postino's forever when I received such outstanding customer service from one of the staff behind the bar and was compensated for my wait. I will be returning and not only that, but my clients were impressed with the service when I told them about it as well. Thank you so much Postino's!",

Even though this is listed as an appetizer, you could definitely share as a meal.  There was 3 in our party and we decided to share a selection of four bruschetta's of which the smoked salmon and pesto was my favorite.",

This is our new spot!!!! Once weekly AT LEAST. Our wine and bruschetta was the best I've ever had. Incredible customer service on top of that?? THAT is what makes an awesome restaurant.

They are really good for groups so if you're having a birthday or some sort of festivity, I'd recommend coming to Postino. My favorite location is the Highland. I love the decor inside and the layout. I must say the prosciutto bruschetta is my favorite. I also love the chicken mozzarella panini with the brussels sprout salad.",

    "text": "My wife and I eagerly chose to dine at Postino Highland last night (Father's Day), being fans of Postino in Gilbert and Phoenix-Arcadia. The Postino Highland did not seem like either of the other Postinos we have enjoyed.   First of all, the god-awful music was poorly chosen and way over-amplified. It seemed at times like ultra-hip urban jazz, at times like a mad high school garage band, and at other times like music to go crazy by.   Second, the service was poor. We were left for seemingly long periods during the meal. Our wait person was pleasant enough, she just wasn't attentive.   Third, the food disappointed for the first time at a Postino. We started the meal with their very good bella postino consisting of artichoke and white bean hummus dips. We ran out of bread before we finished, and our wait person was nowhere to be found.   My wife ordered their \"soup of the moment,\" which was so spicy she couldn't eat it. Our wait person never came by after serving our food to see if it was okay.   I ordered their Hannah's field salad. The greens were tough and overpowered the other ingredients. But I did develop stronger jaw muscles while eating part of it.   Their wines by the glass are over-priced compared to many other quite decent restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.   We do not plan to return to Postino Highland unless they make a big turnaround. A very small number of diners were there when we arrived, and when we left there were no other customers remaining, before the sun went down! If the music had been pleasant and in the background, they may have lingered longer.   So, two thumbs down on that visit!",

After being sat and a bowl being brought for the pooch, we began ordering. We began with wine and after the third in our party arrived we began to order our lunch. We started with the bruschetta and that was absolutely amazing. I would very much recommend the smoked salmon with pesto and the goat cheese and roasted red peppers. Those were my personal favorites. For lunch we had the chicken salad, the soup of the moment (italian sausage which was the perfect size and incredibly flavorful) and the vegetarian panini as well as the grilled cheese.  This place seems perfectly laid back for lunch and the food is incredible. For a perfect almost winter day, sitting on the patio just made it that much more relaxed. Plus the pooch enjoyed himself and all of the attention he received. I would definitely recommend as a perfect lunch or dinner spot.",

    "text": "Incredible. I love a good wine, my husband loves a good beer. This place provided both. It was a suggestion from an old friend who used to live in Scottsdale. We're from Tucson, here on a short weekend trip. Our visit to  Postino was delightful. We were greeted promptly, seated quickly on a Thursday night after 8:00pm. Our host was quick with waters then he offered a couple of solid suggestions on appetizers and beer. He then gave us time to browse the menu. After ordering, our meal arrived quickly.   Here's what we ordered and here's why I crave this place long after we'd gone home: We shared 4 options from the bruschetta board. Keep in mind you get to pick 4 types, and each comes with 4 slices in it. The bread is soft and flavorful. We chose: Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil (very fresh tasting!), Warm Artichoke Spread (I still dream about this), Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato (the bacon didn't add much flavor, but still good), and finally Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. That last one is the one I'd drive 120 miles just to taste again. These guys have this down to an art, and we appreciated it. My husband also ordered their Chicken & Mozzarella panini. The bread was fluffy and crispy at the same time. He said the sandwich was great and the flavors really worked well together.  The music made us laugh, 90s pop, the staff was dancing to it. The decor was fun (old wine labels). The food was a pleasure. We'll be back next time we're in town.",

    "text": "I had heard good things about Postinos and my daughter and I decided that while having lunch together in Old Town we would try it.  First off, when we entered we were disappointed that we could not get Pasta for lunch.   But we decided on a few items and sat and sat and sat.  The server was quite obviously ignoring us as my daughter was completely turned around in her seat and unable to make eye contact with her. Finally I asked one of the young men walking around if we could order as we were suddenly pressed for time to get my daughter to work.  Mostly because it was seventeen minutes from the time we sat down and ordered drinks until I was able to flag down someone to take our order.   Although the server heard me ask the young man if we could order she looked right through us and asked him \"you got it?\"    When the food finally came it was ok. Nothing exceptional but the server continued to be very apathetic.  It seemed to be directed at me although I have no idea why.   All in all a very disappointing experience.  I am a bartender and server and I would be absolutely embarrassed to treat any of my guests the way we were treated.  I was dressed in jeans and a t shirt as I had been cleaning house prior to picking my daughter up.  But I am always an above average tipper and in spite of the sub par service still left 20 percent with hope that the young man who took our order and followed up on our table several times would get the tip.   There are many restaurants in that area I suggest you go somewhere where your business will be appreciated and you will be treated like a guest not an inconvenience.",

Right away, the manager, Chip, came over and introduced himself and welcomed us to the new location. He and the bartender, Justin, were extremely helpful with out food and drink decisions.

Bartender was going to get a tip, but I took it back given the fact I can see my food in front of me; it's behind the bar sitting on a counter in the box sitting in the photo. Horrible wait... will never come back. Inattentive. Lacking for sure.  **Update: Decided to speak to the manager and he was apologetic. He also ended up refunding my money and giving me a brunch card. I appreciated him taking the time to try to mend things. Nevertheless, the restaurant seemed quite chaotic tonight and service suffered.",

This was my first visit to Postino Highland and it's no exception. I typically post up at the bar or at a nearby patio. The restaurant sits a bit up above the sidewalk along Scottsdale Rd. The bar is located on the outer corner of the space and gives a nice, open feel that is just right this time of year with the nice fall temperatures.   While we didn't sample any of the menu items other than a nice crisp Sauvignon Blanc, the offerings are generally quite good ( based on my experiences at other locations ); I was tempted by the Bruschetta selections ordered by the young ladies seated next to us. Next time! And the NYC Grilled Cheese is always a good choice.   The bar seating is really comfortable, the stools / chairs a notch above your typical narrow, ungainly furnishing so: Points there. Staff was great, pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon but always friendly and really helpful and engaging. The vibe is fun, an ideal spot to hang out with friends or even solo. I'll definitely be returning, likely updating this review once I gain a more fleshed out insight to one of my favorite destinations.",

One thing that's a little interesting about this location is that it feels a little \"homier\" to me than some of the other ones (more booths is the main thing I guess), which I'm a little surprised by given the location.   In addition to the usual bruschetta board (this time it was artichoke spread/roasted pepper & goat cheese/salami & pesto/prosciutto & mascarpone...all excellent of course) I also split a mozzarella & tomato salad w/my mom. It was delicious...especially the dressing.   I love that Postino does $5 glasses of wine before 5 pm and since I was with my mom we did a bottle of of Stagedive for $20. Excellent wine, and and excellent deal!",

Thirdly, the bar is large and wraps around three sides so you aren't just staring at the wall.  The food at all Postinos is always good.  I really like the salmon and the salami bruschettas.   Over the years they have really stepped up their craft beer selections which is much appreciated.  This last visit I went with a chardonnay from upstate New York and it was great.",

I LOVE their wall made out of match books! Such a great touch.   As for the food - well everyone knows how amazing Postino is! But, of course, the bruschetta board is a must. My dream board is:  Brie + Green Apples Warm Artichoke Red Peppers + Goat Cheese Salami + Pesto P.S. If you want to add a 5th choice because you just can't decide, you CAN without ordering another entire board.  So my 5th favorite is the bacon + burrata! ;)   Yup, get those and a bottle of wine and you'll be a happy camper, PROMISE! You also can't go wrong with their salads, sandwiches, and soup of the day!

The servers were absolutely amazing and so accommodating, but the manager was extremely rude. He seemed annoyed that we were having our shower there, and was not accommodating about absolutely anything. When we asked him if we could get service because we hadn't seen a server yet, he told us that we had been coming and going too much and he didn't think we should be allowed service until we would finally all sit down. He wouldn't let us put decorations down and was extremely annoyed that we came earlier than our reservation, even though we just wanted to wait, we weren't expecting to be sat early. Once we were done dealing with him though, everything else was awesome. We had two female servers who were great, and one male food runner or busser who was also amazing. Definitely recommend this Postinos location other than the manager who clearly needs some help in customer service.",

She recommended a great bottle of French wine that I normally would not order and I'm so grateful that she did.  I love their bruschetta board and decided to branch out and follow her recommendations.  I tried their Red Pepper Gouda soup- amazing!  She also recommended I try their seasonal cauliflower bruschetta.  Another great suggestion.   The manager, Chip, gracefully touched our table to ensure that we were all enjoying our experience.

The guy in the Wiener dog shirt was so funny I didn't catch his name, but he was always around to keep my drinks full and help out Darrel any way he could. All three of these people said goodbye to me on my way out and it made me feel like I was genuinely appreciated. The food was perfect but the service was so phenomenal it felt like more that eating at a restaurant it felt like home. This is my new favorite spot go check it out, there's no way you could be dissatisfied.",

    "text": "NomNomz: 5/5 Wine: 4/5 Ambiance: Casual, trendy, chill  Postinos is my go-to spot for happy hour and whenever my friends come to visit. Always a good time. This location is a totally different scene than the other locations, and it's in the heart of Old Town. It's the larger of the locations and definitely always poppin. This place is super low key, but has enough energy to keep you coming back for more.  Wine: They've got a great assortment of world renowned select wines. Glasses range from $9-$13, and they offer at least one selection of most varietals. If you need a bubbly fix, they also have prosecco and sparking rose as well.   Beer: The Kierland locations has an assortment of drafts (shorty - $4; Pint - $6; Pitcher - $10), and cans & bottles ranging from $5-$11 if wine isn't your thing. Although it's known as a wine cafe, this place doesn't forget about their hops lovers.   Nomz: Now let's get to the bruschetta boards. What can I say, they're all pretty much to die for. It's really just preference for what you like. My favorites: Smoked salmon w/pesto (I always order double if there's a few of us because this one goes fast ladies n gents), sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese, roasted pepper with goat cheese, salami w/pesto - and my friends always love the burrata and brie selection (you choose 4 for $15).  They have some great salads, sandwiches, and soups to choose from if you want more. Brussel sprout salad ($11), or Tuna Nicoise ($13.50) are my two faves, and you can never go wrong with the NYC grilled cheese ($8.50) and tomato bisque ($4).  Tip: If you're a newbie, sign up on their email list and you'll get a free bruschetta board (their hottest item) your first visit. Also, Every Monday & Tuesday after 8pm, they have a special priced bottle and board for $20.   Service: This place does phenomenal! I've had great service at the tables, but also love this location for their larger bar seating area. They place is always super full, but there's usually a spot to hang at the bar and order drinks (+ food!)  Hours for easy reference:  HAPPY HOUR: until 5pm daily!   Monday-Thursday: 11:00am-11:00pm Friday: 11:00am-12:00am Saturday: 9:00am-12:00am Sunday: 9:00am-10:00pm *kitchen open until 11:00pm",

    "text": "Who knew that there was more to bruschetta than just tomatoes and bread?! Postino opened my eyes to a whole new world of deliciousness - my personal favorites are the artichoke spread and brie/apple/fig (I don't eat pork, therefore my bruschetta options are somewhat limited). They have a great beer & wine selection, and their Board & Bottle deal on Mondays and Tuesdays is the best. I love this place so much that whenever someone comes in to town to visit, I take them here.   They have a large patio which is great, weather permitting. Postino is a perfect spot to grab a quick drink or bite at the bar, dine with a small group of friends or for a large gathering. My only qualm is that there is often a significant wait time if it's after 5pm... which isn't surprising because of how beloved Postino is to the community... so make sure you get there early and don't arrive already starving!",

I've been to this location with each of these scenarios, and I've almost always had a positive experience.   I cannot bear to give any Postino location less than four stars since I love their food and wine so much, but the service has admittedly been a little spotty at this location.  On several occasions, my drink has been forgotten, service has not been attentive, nor has a GM been apologetic.  I hope that the staff at this Highland location will get a little bit better with customer service like their other locations.  Regardless of service, my go-to favorite menu items are the bruschetta board with the following: -apple & brie -prosciutto & fig -salami & pesto -artichoke spread -salmon  I also love the mixed green salad add protein of your choice.  Wine selection is awesome and ambiance is perfect for any scenario.  They make a mean Arnold Palmer as well.  So now you see that even with some spotty service at this Postino location, I'm still a devoted fan... cheers!",

A great place for an Instagram worthy lunch or a wine night with friends. Also don't forget to check out their $20 bottle and board special on Tuesdays! I usually switch between getting the Nine Iron Sandwich or the Bruschetta. The last time I was here I went with the Bacon Burrata (no burrata lol), hummus and tomatoes, Smoked Salmon, and Salami and Pesto Bruschettas and they were all fantastic. First time trying an starter board from there and it was pretty tasty. Creme Brulee was good but not the best I've had, though I'll probably get it again. Overall a great dining experience and I will be back soon!",

This is so paramount in my opinion because it's about service. They see hundreds of people a day and for someone to remember you only after seeing you one time is pretty impressive. As a patron it makes me feel like I'm included and part of the game.   I usually get the bruschetta variations and again, consistent and never disappointed in the taste and quality.

    "text": "BACKGROUND  Well, let me just say that Postino owners, the DeMarco couple and Bailey couple, co-owner's of LGO Hospitality sure have a grip on restaurants AND social media.  As per usual, I'm never oblivious to social media trends and where Yelp sends it's minions, and it's no accident they've been sent to all of the LGO Hospitality venues (including Chelsea's Kitchen and Buck & Rider) and all of five of the Postino's.  It's due to the fantastic vision of it's co-owner Craig DeMarco.  Craig DeMarco is responsible for some of the Valley's best restaurants, including Postino, Windsor and Federal Pizza. As founding partner of Upward Projects, he, along with founding members Kris DeMarco (Craig's wife) and Wyatt and Lauren Bailey, have brought a dozen restaurant projects to the Valley.   Their passion re-purposing classic Valley buildings and invigorating neighborhoods, such as North Central Phoenix, Arcadia and downtown Gilbert has not gone unnoticed.   They're killing it and I am a fan.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  When I first visited Postino's Highland 10 months ago, I IMMEDIATELY LOVED it. This location is my favorite, although I also love the ASU location.  It's just cool and sexy. I feel happy here.  I've been all different times of day and night, and it's just fun.  My last visit, I went with my BFF Whitney. We shared one of their bruschetta boards and had some wine.  I've tried almost everything on the menu, and I've never had a bad meal.  The offerings seem simplistic but have a sophistication and maturity to them.  The wine list and draft beer selection is impressive.  And the service is ALWAYS on point.   CONCLUSION  Does it seem like I'm promoting Postino's Highland?   Well, yes, I am.  That's because I'm very selective and I can't find anything bad to say.  Isn't that what Yelp is for? To promote businesses that we've enjoyed?  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpostinowinecafe.com&s=92c5ce7e03f3d30eaab863c5a91586bfb95affce76d889a0cb678b070f08bc42\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">postinowinecafe.com</a>",

We sat on the patio- being there around 11am, it was a little chilly, but the attentive staff got the fireplace on for us, which definitely added to the experience. We ordered bruschetta ($15 for 4 options) and 2 salads- raspberry chicken salad and the first one on the menu. All were perfect. Top picks for bruschetta: apple and Brie, salami and pesto, fig and marscapone, and artichoke spread. Also enjoy the burrata with bacon.

This is what I call magical!!!",

This location is special because it has an awesome indoor/outdoor area and is larger than some of the others, which I love.   If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. The cheese board is also amazing.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta for $20! It cannot be beat!!",

The last time I was in was seated but had to wait to sit for a few minutes so the young man could take the 2 extra plates, why not take them after we have sat instead of us standing awkwardly in the way of others. Service to get our drinks was slow, mind you there were only a few other tables sat as we were there pretty early. The food came wrong requested chips as side was given salad when asked to get chips they came with attitude again 5 minutes later. Asked for a refill on Diet came back 10 minutes later with regular. Had to hunt down the waiter for the check only to have to hunt him back down to get the $3 charge for chips to be taken off. Even after all this I decided to do a to go order today. Was on hold for 10 minutes before hanging up and taking my business elsewhere. Will not be back and this was a place I regularly got lunch from twice a week.

I prefer to come in between their rush, and understand that service tends to be more scarce during these hours. However, the bar service is ALWAYS slow. I have never had attentive service here, even if I am one of three people here. Their attention always lies in their fellow serving staff and NOT in their clientele. Just a tip from a fellow industry member: spend less time splitting your tips while customers are there and more time attending to them-your tips will be higher.",

She said that she was coming by our table to assure that none of us were driving and asked if we needed a cab called.... We told her no, that we were fine, but also asked if we seemed like we were drunk. She replied, \"There are some signs of intoxication over here, yes.\"   I'm sorry- but we are all grown adults who were not being eccentric or wild- just laughing, chatting, and having a couple of drinks. It was completely demeaning and embarrassing that the manager would accuse us of being intoxicated. Even if we were, that is not how you treat your guests.... Especially when we were literally the only table of patrons on that side of the restaurant. I've been to other Postinos locations that I have enjoyed, but this one left a very bad taste in my mouth.",

For $16.75 (gluten free version) you get a board with 4 delicious options. Love the smoked salmon one and the fig one. I always get those two then experiment a little for the other two. Great wine selection, good beer selection ( try the Kilt Lifter if visiting from out of town. You will be begging your local beer spot to carry it) and a very relaxing environment.

I absolutely loved coming to this location and of course the food was just as amazing as ever!   We got a board of bruschetta. My favorites are the Brie & Apple as well as the Roasted Red Peppers and Goat Cheese. We also had their sparkling Rose which was soooo good! Definitely recommend!   Wish I took pics :( More excuses to come back ;) Service was SPECTACULAR. My water was never empty ;) Great job Upward Projects on another AZ favorite!",

We sat down and noticed it ends at 5:00 pm which is very odd for happy hour and which we did not know before selecting Postino. Most places are 6 pm or even 7 pm like Stone and Vine. Anyway, it was 5:04 pm so we nicely asked our server if she could give us our first glass of wine for the happy hour price ($5). She said, \"no, it's 5:04.\"  We should have left then. We proceeded to have wine (at $10 and $12 a glass) and a light dinner. Service was rude. The door to the patio near us was constantly left open and the 107 degree heat was not enjoyable at all! Not sure ANY of us will visit this location again!",

Came on a Wednesday night after the happy hour special so it was not that busy at the bar area.  It took forever to get my drink order.  I was able to get a seat at the bar and get my water right away but I waited almost 10 mins until one of the two bartenders asked for my order.  The second concern was while I was sitting at the bar I notice in that time frame, police had pulled 2 separate cars over, so although the location is great the cops were out that night.  So my suggestion is to Uber.  The outside patio looked very inviting I really liked the setup not sure if I'll be back to this particular location.",

    "text": "I was in town visiting my fiance's parents and his mom and I had an appointment at Sachi Salon. We got there about an hour early to hopefully enjoy some breakfast. It was about 11 AM on a Sunday morning which is usually, primetime brunch. We got a parking spot in the lot and we noticed Postino. At first, it looked closed from the outside. I opened my Yelp and it said it was open for brunch. We walked over there and it was totally open. Not only open, but there were seats available and no wait. It was meant to be! We were approached by our server, young girl and not super friendly but got our coffees right away for us. I noticed later that they had a French press and I wish that I had ordered that. The coffee was delicious, though. They don't come by and refill it for you, you have to ask. I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with my eggs poached, which they said they don't do poached eggs but rather based eggs, which I had never heard of and actually prefer, they were very good. It came with bacon and cranberry walnut toast and I ordered a side of avocado. The toast was absolutely delicious and it came on a beautiful board with a great presentation. My fiance's mother ordered the grilled focaccia bread which came with eggs with a side of fruit. Hers looked delicious as well. The food came out in a fairly quick time span and our server started growing on us, or us on her! The overall decor was really cool as it is advertised as a wine bar. I wonder what the night environment is like. I'm so excited that we were able to find this place and enjoy breakfast so last minute. It was convenient, the prices were affordable too high given the area we were in.",

The outdoor patio area is also spacious and great for a breezy AZ spring day. Overall we had a nice lunch here as everything tasted good and my friend was satisfied with her wine and pick two meal. Mine started out great from walking in to Postinos and being acknowledged by several hosts/waiters. However as soon we we were seated outdoors the service got a bit spotty. (Understanding it was around 12 with the lunch hour rush) I had ordered tea and while I was brought a mug with a selection of teas, they had forgotten to bring out the hot water pot for quite a while. This also happened for the bruschetta I ordered so sadly I had nearly finished my salad when the one bruschetta was brought out.   So I highly recommend Postinos but possibly outside of the lunch rush hour! I'd also recommend to Postinos to have a \"pick two\" where one bruschetta could be one of the options you could pick as part of your combo.",

My favorite two are the Brie and Apple & fig spread and the ricotta with dates and & pistachios. They are both so delicious paired with wine. The Brie is so smooth and it pairs with the sweet fig spread sooo well. The sandwich was ok but the salad was nice. You definitely cannot go wrong with the bruschetta.",

Make sure to notice the deco, its very interesting.  Wish there was more vegetarian options, or at least more deserts. But the cauliflower with home made sauce and the chocolate based dessert was very tasty.  Definitely a must visit, more so since they are spread over more than 1 area.",

    "text": "Holy moly this place was fantastic! Unfortunately we didn't stumble upon this place until the last day of our long weekend stay. And it was right around the corner from our AirBnB, bummer! Our first and only visit was so worth it!   Postino has an incredible happy hour that we took advantage of: $5 glass of wine or pitcher of beer until 5pm. They have an incredible selection of wine to fit anyone's tastes. Another amazing special: $20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm.   Of course we couldn't just drink rose all afternoon so we ordered the Butcher's Block and four bruschetta breads. They do not skimp on the meat and cheese plate like other places might. I hate when I order a charcuterie board and there's two pieces of cheese and a slice of ham. At Postino they load that board up. They were also nice enough to bring us more bread without charging us. Now onto the different bruschetta: these were so delicious! We got the spinach artichoke, smoked salmon, Brie & apples, and a seasonal that had a crap ton of bacon it-- no complaints here.   My only complaint is that there isn't a Postino in KC! This would definitely be one of my go to happy hour spots.",

We were absolutely not disappointed, as everything was not only delicious but the staff was extremely friendly. We so enjoyed ourselves that we went a second time before we left to return home, and the management recognized us and came over to chat with us about our vacation. Very wonderful on all levels, we will be going again when my partner graduates from ASU in the spring. Thanks Tim!",

Came here to have another glass of the sparkling Moscato and a bruschetta board, this time at the bar, with amiable, unobtrusive, and handsome server Bobby.

I don't know if Management just doesn't staff well, if they are hiring, if they are extremely understaffed? I have no idea what is going on but most of the waiters seemed frazzled. They were overextended in regards to tables they were assisting. I would watch the line of food coming out which seemed to be coming at a reasonable pace and yet it would sit there for up to ten minutes (yes, I legit was timing it) and the whole thing would be full of food orders waiting to be taken to tables and a couple of waiters/waitresses would go up at the same time to only stand there and try to sort through the tickets. We went during dinner time between 5-6 p.m. and the place was full which I am sure it always is, but maybe Corporate should hire more people? Food was good, wine was good, service was unfortunately not. I'm sure I'll be going back at some point in my life, but so far this is my second disappointment.",

It's not the closest one to me, but I wanted to see what their awesome design team did with this iconic example of Modern Phoenix architecture. I've always loved how Upward Projects repurposes interesting, older buildings for many of their restaurants. This particular building is very special, especially for a modern architecture geek such as myself. The service and food were, as usual, very good. But when I asked the (dreamy) bartender who designed the building, he incorrectly told me Frank Llyod Wright. This building was constructed in 1967 and was designed by Frank Henry who taught at Taliesin West but never met FLW, who died in 1959. Details matter.",

Service started out pretty good and then wandered into the void as the evening progressed  and the place got busier.  They did allow Morris on the patio although there did seem to be some confusion as to whether this was normal policy. If you are going out and your  main interest is socializing than this is a good place. Food is nothing special for the price but decent.",

Whenever I go here, say: for quick munch with friends after work; during the middle of the day for a rejuvenating mimosa; or even at night when I want a balance between romantic atmosphere and a crowd with a reservoir energy if things were to pop off - Postino's is always able to make each experience worthwhile.  It's quite spacious inside, but there may be issues with parking because Postino is one hot tamale in ol'Scottsdale. Once your inside though, the staff has perfected the customer service deal. Courteous in asking you how your day was, but cognizant that you want a seat quickly so you can get down to your business.  Every order I have gotten here has been solid. I typically go for the board of meats that starts with a C. I called it my Charizard plate because I can't remember the name of it and I feel like a Pokemon would relish the taste and the large portions they serve. But regardless of the name, you're gonna wanna imbibe as many fluids(alcohol) as possible with your meals to make the experience perfect.  This place is a solid high five.",

I sat at the bar and quickly realized there were many a regular there to take advantage of the deal.  The wine list was solid, and at $5 a glass was a real value.  For food I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato/mozzarella. The portion of the grille cheese was large! Three sandwiches came out on the board with a variety of sauces. The bread was fresh and tasty but the sandwiches were a little skimpy on the cheese.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were perfect. Great flavor and presentation.  Perfect sized portion.  Service at the bar was solid. I got enough attention without feeling bothered.   Overall the experience was pretty good. It got me out of the hotel without needing an Uber or walking to far in the crazy AZ heat. The biggest criticism I have is the ambience. The decor felt dated (think late 70s/early 80s). A facelift (and more cheese on the grilled cheese) would do wonders for Postino.",

I used to come to Postino so often for lunch and dinner, I had no idea they had breakfast until Snooze was too busy and we saw Postino was open (that was down at the Annex location) but since then, I find myself coming more often for the brunch menu since it's such a treat.   They still offer their gluten-free bread for any of the breakfast options. I usually get the Morning Staple (eggs, potatoes, bacon, and toast--served with a delicious berry jam) but I decided to try the Farm Scramble instead (served with eggs, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and a salad). It was delicious and a total mix of sweet (from the salad dressing and tomatoes) to savory (from the cheese and eggs). My date got the B.E.L.T (which is a breakfast panini with bacon, eggs, lettuce, and tomatoes!)   I'm just OBSESSED by how unique and flavorful the items are. They take regular breakfast foods but elevate it by adding in extra seasoning and ingredients that enhances the flavor. Let's just say, the food is NEVER boring! They even have breakfast tea (my FAVORITE is the herbal with mint). If you're a Postino's fan, you have to check out their brunch!",

Mind you the hotel I was staying at had its own restaurant and eating options, but yet they recommended this place to me, so I figure that's a good sign!  I came for lunch and was immediately greeted at the door. The place had just opened up and they mentioned they have a wine list for $5 wines. Although it wasn't even noon yet, I said what the heck! It's 5:00 somewhere right?!  I had my phone and charger in hand so my server asked if I wanted to sit near an outlet. Yeah of course I do. Thank you for that - when the little things are big things. I had just gotten off a long flight and needed to charge my phone.  I ordered the chicken mozzarella panini and it was quite filling for lunch and the wine was nice after my long flight from Baltimore.  The place got packed pretty quickly and I can see why. I really enjoyed my visit here.   I chatted with my server a bit and he mentioned that they are bringing one of these to DC in the near future. I can't wait!",

I have visited a Postinos a long time ago, but I don't really remember what I had before. This time when I tried the food it was so amazing that I want to go back.  I had several of the bruschettas, but the ones that I really liked was the Brie, apple, and fig spread bruschetta. The next time I go, I want to also try the prosciutto di Parma, fig, and mascarpone bruschetta. I'd like to have the warm artichoke spread too. The smoked salmon and pesto sounds great. The salami pesto sounds ok too. I know I tried at least four different flavors, but they just weren't as good as my favorite one.",

And my salad was pretty small in quantity, in my opinion. But it was tasty. My partner's soup was delicious and so was her salad.   I can't wait to come back to try some different offerings and maybe even happy hour drinks.  The ambiance inside and out is very appealing; the bar area as well! It's certainly a do over for me.",

    "text": "I was in town for the weekend on a girl's trip and we decided we couldn't NOT go to Postino's. Running the risk of sounding basic; we decided we had seen too many fabulous Instagram posts about the Bruschetta that we had to try it for ourselves.....   We were seated at a central booth (in the middle of two walkways). After just having placed a rather sizable order for 3 small girls, we were chatting and anxiously awaiting our food. Our appetites quickly dissipated when a fellow patron walked past our table and projectile vomited EVERYWHERE, and then proceeded not to say anything and pretend it didn't happen. It's a dimly lit restaurant with dark floors and we were the only 3 people to see this unfold. I quickly raced to the host stand to fill an employee in on the situation. Before anything could be done 3 waiters simultaneously slipped on the vomit.... as the 'puker' walked past and sat back down at his table pretending nothing ever happened (he quickly there after ran out).   Needless to say it felt like we were either on an episode of candid camera or in the midst or a very, very gross dream. This, of course, was no reflection on the restaurant, but did make it more challenging to enjoy our meal.   Despite having to gag down our food, we were impressed by the bruschetta. Our favorites were the Smoked Salmon & Pesto, Burrata & Bacon, and Brie Apple & Fig. Between 3 people we split a board of 4 bruschetta, a cheese board, and a salad.",

They do have other really good food options- good paninis and salads.   We got a bruschetta board. Our choices were (1) Apple/Fig (2) Tomato/Mozz (3) Prosciutto/Masc (4) Bacon/Burrata in order. And we ordered the brussel sprout salad to share. They kindly brought out the salad already split into two bowls, which was a nice touch.   We also ordered a glass of wine each since they had their happy hour going on! It paired well with the bruschetta.   As always, we loved every item! I will come here forever, maybe one day when I become a certified Scottsdale mom.",

My choices on the bruschetta were just ok. We went with the 1. prosciutto, fig, mascarpone 2. Dates, pistachios, Ricotta 3. Pepper jam 4. Arugula, bacon, mozzarella. The pepper jam one was the best but the rest we're just so-so.  We also got a half sandwich and salad. I got the gluten-free chicken & mozzarella sandwich and the Brussels sprouts salad. My wife got the tuna sandwich and Brussels sprouts salad as well.  They appeared to be very cautious with all of my gluten-free requests.  Both sandwiches and salads were very good. The Brussels Sprouts salad may have been the best item.  Overall we were very happy with the experience and would say this is a very good option for those out there with Celiacs and need gluten-free.",

It seems warmer & more upscale, with nicer and more booths, & has a huge outdoor dining area with fireplace and heaters. (See photo.)   It's right across from the Optima, by Fashion Square Mall, and their \"'table' seating and bar area side\" looks out at the beautiful view.   They have awesome deals on wine! Take a look at my photo of \"just the wines as you walk in,\" which is a fraction.\" Hit them on a wine and bruschetta board night, and the wine pays for itself. 'What a deal. They also have a great beer selection.  The food is always consistent and delicious! My absolute favorite thing to order, for either lunch or dinner, is the half sandwich/ half soup. They have a different soup every day, and some are super unique. The chefs like to keep it switched-up. I've been there when the \"soup of the moment\" was a spicy andouille sausage minestrone type, a tomato basil (which the other people in my party loved, however I thought that it tasted exactly like a jar of spaghetti sauce). My favorite it ABSOLUTELY their potato leek soup! OMGosh, I could have had 3 bowls of that even though I was stuffed after one (and the \"half sandwich.\") See the photo of their half sandwich. To me, it's a big portion & same with the soup and salad.  The sandwich that I love is the \"Nine Iron\" Panini (See photo.) Turkey, bacon, mixed greens lettuce, tomato, and a creamy mayo with a hint of horseradish taste that they call dijonnaise.  If they don't have a soup that sounds appealing, I'll get their signature half salad with my \"Nine Iron.\" The salad has a scoop of chicken salad (that is fantastic, with green apples, almonds, pecans, and it seemed like I had some dried cranberries & maybe peanuts in mine). Trust me people love it!!! The chicken salad is surrounded by beautiful mixed greens topped with a subtle sprinkling gorgonzola crumbles. But, OH that raspberry dressing on the side! Everyone I know goes crazy over it!!! It's  called a raspberry vinaigrette, but I don't taste acidity in it at all. To me, it tastes like a fresh raspberry coulis!  Thus the prices are great.  A half soup/ half sandwich (actually large) and an Arnold Palmer for only $15.   Since I always check the cleanliness for Dining Grades, I took a photo of the cute stack of \"P.\" toilet paper in the clean restroom, the restaurant was also spotless, and the view through the open kitchen made me give them a thumbs-up.  Nick and ALL of the servers who have ever waited on me (or my crew) at this location are just so much more sharp and friendly that at the Keirland location. 'Example, one slick waiter did this cool flip with our credit card landing it into the clip-board clip. And they are fast, super friendly & attentive even when they're packed.  It's just a fun, happenin' place, while at the same time, being warm, and with unique seating areas like the recessed large group area. (Check out my photo.)",

On our most recent visit, we came to this location twice in one weekend because we love it that much.   $5 wine for happy hour, and the happy hours are long. The bruschetta is some of the most amazing that I've ever had and all the flavors are delicious. My favorites are the salmon pesto, the traditional caprese, and the salami pesto. They also have one bruschetta option that they change up every once in awhile, and on our visit they had the mortadella which was awesome. They switch up the soups daily, and we got the turkey and kale soup. Delicious but so small if you order the cup.   This place is also interior design goals. Such a gorgeous sitting area and indoor/outdoor concept. Perfect location for brunch photos or to even come at night for a drink at the bar (I believe they're open until midnight).  Postino is also surprisingly decently priced for the quality of the food and the atmosphere, imo. It's definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  Please open up a location in California!",

I think the breakdown is less than $2 a beer for Kilt Lifter and many other local favorites. Outstanding value.   The bruschetta is amazing and I haven't tried one I haven't liked. The ricotta, smoked salmon, artichoke, Brie and prosciutto are a few of my go to's, but I seem to switch it up every time depending on my mood. They are great to share. Yum.

It was a good tasting sandwich, but it contained two slices of turkey and that turkey was not the best quality. It also could have been pressed more on the machine. The side of chips were out of the bag, but the side salad which contained raspberry and some cheese and leafy greens and walnuts was pretty good. The Bellini was only $5 and that had a nice refreshing taste, while all glasses of wine are also only $5 until 5pm. Very young crowd now that school is back in session.

I feel the simplicity of this concept is evolving and not as simplistic as when the first Postino's  opened on Central. I am not complaining, it's still a very clean menu, with sandwiches salads a soup a few cheesy appetizers and of course the bruschetta. We also had the brunch menu to choose from and it looked yummy!  Everything I tasted was tasty especially my salad with pears, pecans and gorgonzola. I was a little underwhelmed by the bruschetta, and at $15.00 it seemed a little small.  Service was Clunky, yet friendly and professional. The issue I noticed was 2 servers were in service sequence back to back. It seemed like one didn't know someone had started the table, and then returned again to mimic the other servers sequence of service.  The walnut tables are beautiful however drinks were served without napkins or coasters and our table was wet all over the place. I finally mentioned the issue to our server and a cocktail napkin was deliverd to me only, and then removed with the next Ice tea refill.  It's a great concept with a pretty good perceived value. Check this spot out, and I will be back as well.",

Postino has some of the yummiest food around and I'm excited to have an additional location nearby. :) Service is great - I had a wonderful experience with Tessa and the hostess that day even ran after me when I left my sunglasses behind on the table. Truly appreciate the good people and good food! Will be back often!",

We came for their soft opening, and it was a wonderful evening. The cheese board and bruschetta boards were on point. Naturally, I had myself some lovely bellinis and the main squeeze had some yummy dark beer. The only downside to the evening was that they didn't yet have a couple of the beers on the menu. My fiance had to order 3 times because every beer he ordered was not in stock yet. However, you can't really find fault with that since literally 3 days ago this place still had no windows and no interior. They got everything up and running overnight!  New favorite spot for an easy date night. Plus, it's right next to my salon so I'm probably going to have some bubbly here before I get my hair cut next :)",

I read the reviews and thought people were being picky about the music. NOT SO! The music is painfully loud and I was uncomfortable the second I walked in. We arrived at 7pm and there was plenty of parking and only 1 couple near the hostess stand milling about so I thought JACKPOT! We'll get a table quick. There were literally 3 empty booths right by the door and a few tables with hand written Reserved signs on them. Imagine my shock when the hostess said 35-40 minute wait! Probably a godsend because I was already sick of the music, but shouldn't there be a ton of people around if it takes 40 minutes to get a table on Saturday night? I'm still trying to connect the dots? Anyhoo. We left. Not going back until future reviewers say the volume control on the radio is working again and wait times match the number of people waiting on a table.",

First of all I LOVE Postinos- I have frequented the Arcadia location and recently went into the Kierland location where I received great service. The food never disappoints. Last Friday I received terrible service. I was on the patio and the server was a female with brown hair and I wish I got her name because whoever owns the franchise cannot want someone like that working for them. She was genuinely annoyed at the thought of doing anything for us. I am very forgiving of servers who get busy or have bad nights because I have been there but this was just a miserable experience. I arrived a little after the others and asked for water- the server never brought it so I asked someone else. She actually never came to the table after I arrived for a solid 15 minutes in the first place. Finally when she did come I ordered everything because the other members of my party said she was not reliable. I got an appetizer and an entree - they just came out at the same time. She genuinely looked disgusted by us every time we interacted with her. I still am giving this 3 stars because I love the food and next time I'm in hopefully we get better service.",

The crowd was very young, loud and rowdy. I would prefer the Arcadia or Kierland location for an older crowd. Wine selection was great, bruschetta board was superb! We also ordered a panini and salad.. Wasn't crazy about the chicken mozzarella panini or the Hanahs field salad. We also ordered the lava cake for dinner which was yummy, but my husband said it tasted like pure cocoa powder to him... Overall pretty good.

I thought the choices for bruschetta was great lots of options had great choices of many different flavors, but the bruschetta I had at a local competitor it was better.   Had I not been to that other restaurant I probably would have like this one a lot better. Out of respect for Postino I will not mention who that competitor was. Overall we had a great experience the food is not overpriced as on the menu were sandwiches soups and appetizers but all in all had a great time. I would come back.",

I'm soooo glad that I didn't take a customer there or book this for our executives. There was bird feces everywhere out back. We sat out back and I felt like I was sitting in bird droppings all around me. I was disgusted. We moved inside because the sun was blinding us and it was so dirty. It was much cleaner inside; however, the service was not good (a young gal with long dark hair). We received our food and our waitress never came to ask us if we needed anything or how everything was. Another gal, with long dark hair, did give us a refill..... which when she filled a glass of iced tea, it ran onto the floor and she never came back to wipe it up.  We finally had to ask someone to get our check. On a good note, the food was really great, just very disappointed in the cleanliness and service. Hope this helps.",

We often go for happy hour and order the Butcher Block (an appetizer consisting of various meats, cheeses, olives, nuts and hummus) to enjoy with our wine.  In the past we have always found the food fresh with a wonderful presentation.  The last couple of times it seemed kind of slapped together and did not seem as fresh. We are wondering if the chain is growing too fast, or they are taking on a more corporate culture since they are now have so many locations.  We still enjoy going but are concerned that one of our favorite places is losing some of its charm.",

I had come here, not been served right away, yelped a negative review about it, and was located by the general manager of the restaurant within forty five minutes later... Yes, you read that right...I have NEVER had much respect for  managers at restaurants from experience of working at a restaurant, but wow. Employees must feel lucky to be working for Chip (GM), as he is someone I would want to work for. This restaurant has completely changed my perspective on customer service at restaurants and how a place can be completely the opposite of your first impression. FABULOUS food, but you should come here for the service alone. Thank you Postino for a genuinely memorable experience.",

    "text": "Postino was one of the first recommendations I received when I moved to Phoenix - for good reason! They have a killer $20 deal that includes a bottle of wine and Bruschetta on Monday and Tuesday after 8pm. Surprisingly, I don't come to Postino for the wine, but for the Bruschetta. I'm more of a beer gal myself and there's $5 pitchers of beer during Happy Hour plus Bruschetta for the same price. (Also, for my fellow native East Coasters, they have Brooklyn Beer on tap! I nearly fainted when I saw it, this is one of my favorite brews, so it's easy to get your beer fix on here even amongst the wino's).  Back to the infamous $20 deal- it's simply Arizona locals' favorite because the Bruschetta is large. If you're picturing tiny little pieces of bread, no, magnify it to Arizona size- they are huge. Not only that, but the ingredients are very fresh. I've ordered both savory and sweet and they are all great. If I had to pick a few to order, I'd say I always re-order the Sweet & Spicy Pepper Jam with Goat Cheese as well as the Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios. I can't think of another occasion where I can have spicy jam on bread with goat cheese, but at Postino's I can, and it's delicious.  In addition to their fare, the ambience is great, too. There are little details at Postino like the matchboxes on the wall that span decades, the neon yellow \"Weird is Rad\" sign and brightly lit chandeliers by the bar. And at this particular location, the restaurant used to be a bank in the 60's, originally designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's apprentice.  Oh Postino I've already hit up the Central and Highland locations, now I'm on to circling the next.",

The misters help too.    If you've been in the valley for more than a week you've probably been to Postino several times so the food and drink selections should be familiar.  I've never thought their food was great but the atmosphere and the drink specials ($5 pitchers of craft beer before 5PM!!) are tremendous.  This location is newer than the rest but everything else will feel familiar.",

    "text": "Beautiful and delicious. Hubby and I went out for a date. We were looking for tapas and wandered to Scottsdale. Impressed by the Bruchetta Board my children and I enjoyed at the Tempe location, I was eager for my husband to enjoy the experience as well.   Postino is a semi-outdoor, open concept. Even though it was hot on the outside, with the misters, it felt surprisingly cool.  We were ushered to a table immediately by our lovely hostess. Our attentive server took care of us, providing careful service that was not overbearing.   I enjoyed my refreshing Bellini ($5 everyday/all the time). Hubby ordered a Pilsner on tap that stayed cold through the evening.   We ordered 2 Bruschetta Boards ($15 each). You select from a list of toppings. They organized the Bruchetta from mildest flavors to most robust. Board 1: Brie and Green Apple with preserves, Prosciutto with figs, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata and Bacon. Board 2: Warm artichoke, Pistachio and date, Pesto Salami and Seasonal: Romanesco and cauliflower. This was a feast for the senses. The boards are colorful, packed with flavor and textures. Our favorites were the well balanced Brie, green apple and preserves combination that balanced sweet, savory and tart. The smoked salmon was delicate, accented by the pesto and capers. We were surprised by the Romanesco cauliflower combination. We liked the textures of the roasted corn and cauliflower on the Romanesco backdrop. We thought the weakest combinations were the Warm artichoke and the Pistachio Date pairings. They were not bad, just not outstanding.  Thank you, Postino, for a lovely dining experience. I did not disappoint my Honey with this recommendation.",

The ricotta with dates and pistachio was probably my favorite! Very light and sweet. We also ordered the smoked salmon with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone and the sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese! Also the cucumber honey lemonade was probably one of the best lemonades I've ever had... And wines and other beverages for $5 before 5 whhhattt. The restaurant itself was also very aesthetically pleasing and the wait staff made sure we were enjoying our lunch. We will definitely be back!",

Their happy hour has $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer (and they had plenty of great options of both). The only downside is it ends at 5 pm so it's more of weekend deal for me. For late night, they have their $20 deal that includes a bruschetta board (4 kinds) and bottle of wine. Their bruschetta is the best in town (The roasted peppers with goat cheese and the artichoke spread my two must orders! I get them every time and then switch up the other two). The $20 deal is only offered Monday and Tuesday's after 8 pm. My favorite items on the menu are the butcher board (it's huge, perfect to split with another person), the turkey panini, and raspberry chicken salad.",

There were several empty tables available,  but still seated within time given.  Once seated,  it took about 10-15 mins before being acknowledged and our order was taken.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and food all together. Our drinks were tea,  never were they refilled through the course of the meal.  Our sandwiches and salads came out in a reasonable time.  The salad was good, although the added turkey resembled deli meat and wasn't broken up for bite size. The panini' s had hardly any filling inside, very little meat, lettuce and other toppings.  The chicken salad was good.  Our main food came out before the appetizer.  When we asked about it we were told the chef was new and was working on it.  It was a bruscetta board. We got it about midway into our meal.  It was probably the best part of the meal.  Even so, it should have been comped or discounted in the least. This was my first visit,  not sure if I  would return. Overall food was okay, and service was mediocre.  For the price and location,  I anticipated a differen experience.",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the most amazing and attentive staff. From the host to our server, Mairi, to the manager, Raul, my party was treated with so much hospitality. Everyone was genuinely friendly and very accommodating. That alone is enough to make me want to return.    The interior of the restaurant affects an intimate ambiance of romance the likes of which I've never felt at any other location. From the table candles to the dimmed lighting, the staff has spared no inattention to detail. My mood was instantly elevated and I could not stop smiling.  Now on to the food. Everything, and I do mean everything, tasted so fresh and amazing. I was impressed with the flavors and the wine selection was respectable. Although, I do feel unworthy of commenting on the wine list since I'm not much of a connoisseur. In fact, I ordered a glass of moscato and while I was met with expressions of disdain and shame from my own party, our server continued to treat me with a dignity I clearly did not deserve.   Great food coupled with atmosphere and impeccable service (truly, second to none) makes this my new go-to for date nights or just a casual dinner with close friends. Because of Raul and Mairi, I will definitely return more often. Thank you so much for providing such a beautiful experience.",

We let them know we had an infant and toddler with us, they gave my little one some cool pliable sticks that she played with the whole time And they gave us enough room for my friend to be able to park her stroller close enough to her so that she could watch her baby. My friends ordered a sandwich to share and they split it for them, this was a nice added touch- they are also vegetarian and the server was great about going over options with them. Since my last review they have added a veggie board called The Bounty....this is my new fave option here. While it's technically an appetizer, I order it often as my main dish. It includes lots of fresh veggies, grilled cauliflower and flash fried brussel sprouts, plus a delish almond hummus and plenty of treats. We also tried the butcher's block and were impressed with the variety of cured meats, olives, nuts, dried cherries, cheese and on and on and on.... Def give this place a try, the food is excellent and the service has always been top notch.",

However, a couple of my coworkers selected the Scottsdale location as their choice for lunch when we went to celebrate their birthdays recently and I was very impressed. The food is excellent. Postino's has a great selection of sandwiches, salads, soups and flatbreads to choose from and everything is excellent. I tried the roast beef sandwich on one occasion and the nine-iron, with bacon and chicken on another. My coworkers had everything from the soup of the day to the flatbreads and everyone was very happy.  The atmosphere was very welcoming, with large open tables and plenty of room. Also, unlike some places the acoustics and background noise were good so that you could actually the people across the table from you. Service was fast and friendly as well.  I was glad to find that Postino's is more than just a wine bar and would definitely recommend it as a place to visit!",

    "text": "Ah my beloved Postino's!  The food is consistently good, healthy, and fresh. The vibe is fun and inviting and the staff work cooperatively so service is smooth and hassle free. No matter when I go I get a great meal. Granted it gets crowded on weekend nights which I avoid but even when packed the staff are chill and helpful. Their salads are tasty, not overly dressed and as mentioned fresh. The bread used is from a local baker who consigns directly with Postino's, I could eat the entire bread board solo but  control myself. The vegetarian sandwich is so, so tasty as are their soups (but do ask if any meat is used in prepration). A super deal is to mix half portions of sandwichs,   soup or half salads. Not a huge menu but plenty of choices, Again the staff are very open to getting information on ingredients and preparation methods and the kitchen will modify dishes. I don't drink alcohol but they are a wine bar and friends say the selections are great. This Postino's is in my neighborhood so I feel like it is home.  I always feel welcomed and that attitude extends  to locals and visitors  alike, Simply good food without pretense or \"attitude\"  There is a beautiful patio with misters too.",

A member of the group brought her boyfriend) and rather than accommodating an extra chair for us, which we would only have needed for 10-15 minutes as several members of the party left shortly after our request, they said we could get our checks and leave instead. Upon asking to speak to a manager we were told they were able to find another chair, which we no longer needed, but still decided to get our checks and take our party elsewhere. It's a shame that a party of 12 who was ordering food and multiple bottles of wine couldn't be accommodated. I will not be dining at this location again with a group or otherwise. Really disappointed as I generally love dining at Postino, but I'll have to find another location to frequent.",

    "text": "They told us one hour. It was closer to two. Waited another 15 for service. I understand it is crowded for the board and bottle deal, but the crowd needs to be managed in a way that's more accurate to customers in terms of commitment made and that deals with tables in a way that aids in assuaging the insane wait. Your servers can't really do anything so this isn't a reflection of service, rather the poorly managed expectations and wait. Otherwise, service is strong and food is perfectly acceptable.  UPDATE: Raul, the manager at this location, completely reacted in a gracious and constructive way that made us all feel positively about Postino and rectified the situation. He came to our table and chatted with us about what had happened, which makes me feel optimistic not only about the quality of the restaurant but also about this issue being improved in the future. I will continue to return because of what he did tonight. Additionally, Ameya, our server, was excellent, attentive, and sympathetic. It is these two people that mean my review is going from 2 to 5 stars. The service recovery that happened here has created significant loyalty in our group and I hope the feedback about managing expectations via underpromising and over delivering in the future truly is productive. Thank you Raul and Ameya.",

The open-air location is GORGEOUS, the service is impeccable, and the happy hour is amazing ($5 pitchers of craft beer and glasses of wine until 5PM)!!  And I haven't even gotten to the bruschetta yet!! Before Postino, I used to think that bruschetta had to be watery tomato spread on uninspiring pieces of hard toast. I was SO WRONG. The bruschetta board here serves up HUGE, FLUFFY pieces of bread topped with fresh ingredients. My personal favorites are the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and the Warm Artichoke Spread.  The craziest thing to me is that every time my good friend Megan T. and I have stopped by on a weekend, there's been NO WAIT. If this place existed in San Francisco, I guarantee you'd need to wait AT LEAST an hour. Arizona, please get your sh*t together and give this place the recognition it deserves!  Now that I'm moved out of Arizona, my heart breaks knowing that I won't know the next time I'll be able to come back. Postino, you have a guaranteed customer in me if you ever make a move to California :)",

A very hip interior and a lovely patio make this place a dream to come to...and that is before we even start talking about the food and drink. If I lived up in this area, I would probably come for their bottle and board special (1 bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20! INSANE) all the time. I of course did try their wine and bruschetta which were very good. They have $5 glasses of wine or $5 pitchers of beer daily from 11am-5pm. Their bruschetta stole the show for me though. A couple of my favorites were the smoked salmon with pesto, warm artichoke spread, and their seasonal (when we went it was a sweet lemon mascarpone that was to die for!) Move a location down to Tucson please!!",

The food flavors are amazing (I had the delicious veggie panini), the wine list is unique and filled with an excellent assortment of tasty affordable wines, and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. Not to mention the place is beautiful inside. I am an Arizona native and once upon a time visited the old Valley National Bank this used to be in the 70's...I loved the retro feel and how they paid homage to the history of this venerable old building. Well done. Hands down my new favorite place for getting together with friends.",

She was engaging and happily explained the beer selections of Pitchers for $5.00 and was knowledgeable about those, and the menu choices we were interested in. We ordered the Butcher's Block.  It is $15.50. That was an amazing assortment of varied meats and cheeses, with crostini. We substituted the hummus for cheese. There were also nuts and olives, dried cherries to compliment any drink you might have there. We appreciated not only that it was already \"Happy Hour\", but Marissa at the bar gave the feeling of Happy Hour vibe. We are going back!",

Paired a nice bottle of white Sauvignon Blanc with the Butcher's Board and 4 different kinds of bruschetta, which was all delicious. We ended the meal with two of the dessert collections, because they looked too good to only have one. There is a great ambience in this rustic restored building. I love good wine and a great tasting menu and Postino's provided just that!",

I'm giving 5 stars despite the wait time because the manager did what (in my opinion) any good manager should do (in fact, i think they went beyond) when guests have to wait so long for their food. Our waitress apologized several times and they comped our whole bill! Free drinks or dessert would have been fine but I think this shows they care a lot about their customers!",

If I went back and it was the same bartender, I'd definitely walk out and go to another of the 100 great establishments close by. People sitting on both sides of us expressed the same frustration. Aside from this (fixable) issue, happy to see the new Postino in swing!",

I have been to Postino countless times and there is always a level of consistency that I appreciate and look forward to. And the taste! Oh. My. God. I get cravings for their bruschetta and it never ceases to amaze me how amazing it tastes. The atmosphere at Highland is cool, edgy and sophisticated from the large patio, floor to ceiling windows, matchbox feature wall and that rad neon sign in the back. And finally the service is what I enjoy the most. The staff, from manager to hostess to waitress, is always warm and welcoming. It is great when you can walk into a restaurant and know you won't have any issues because the staff gets it and cares about you, your food and your experience. Postino Highland is THE place to be on a Friday night. Or any night. Or day. I mean really you can't go wrong.",

There is a reason it is usually packed as it it just that good.  In particular the happy hour is hard to beat with $5 pitchers of local craft brews as well as many good wines for $5 a glass.  Also, the Bottle and Board on Monday and Tuesday's after 8:00 is one of the best deals around.  We have tried pretty much everything on the menu and it is hard to go wrong.  The bruschetta boards are a must have and they mix up the choices by always having a seasonal option.",

Upon being seated the young waiter by the name of Jasmine came to my table and was very nice, presentable, and just absolutely the best.
