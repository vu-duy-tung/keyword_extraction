We made a reservation because we didn't know what to expect, since it was also on the other side of town from us. Turns out, we didn't need the reservation, they started getting busy around 7pm and we had gotten there a little earlier to take advantage of happy hour specials. We started out with some spring rolls - not much flavor and they reminded my husband of frozen spring rolls from a grocery store. Then we had the chicken katsu, viva las vegas roll, and the king crab roll. Other than the spring rolls, our food was great!! Our server was awesome and very personable too. Will definitely go back and hopefully snag a patio table!",

It's super dark in there though and the booth on the far back of the restaurant is destroyed and uncomfortable. They should replace that and make it at least acceptable to seat paying customers.

We had to go up to the bar to get our own place settings. When we asked a manager about where our waiter went, he said he was being slammed in the inside. So, I guess we were not as important as the 'inside' customers.... The sushi was marginal. maguro on the sashimi plate tasted as though it was freezer burnt, and didn't taste right at all. Miso lacked any flavor at all. We finished our drinks before the main course came out and were never asked if we wanted more beer or sake. What waiter walks away from another bar charge??  Won't be coming back.... ever. If I could give this ZERO stars I would. Can I get back the last hour of my life?",

We did not expect Japan-style sushi in Arizona.  We did not make a reservation.    We were seated promptly, and had drinks quickly.  It took a bit to place our order but I was with old friends and didn't mind the conversation.  When sushi started arriving and drinks started coming out, the service was efficient and courteous and right on.  This Kierland Commons atmosphere could exist anywhere.  I felt like I could have been in California or Texas or Washington DC.  Freshness is a key ingredient with sushi, and everything on our table seemed to have a hint of freshness.

I will probably go back there when I go Phoenix again next time. But Sushi Nigiri from a la carte menu are pricy.

    "text": "I used to frequent this RA on a very regular basis and absolutely loved it. Always received great service and was seated in a timely manner (even during rush time)  I just went here with a girlfriend a couple of Fridays ago and it was awful. I would give it one star except I'm hoping this might be a one time thing however many signs indicated it is not.  The wait was AT LEAST 30 minutes long, thinking it was worth it we waited, saw some friends and they got sat at a table large enough for us all to sit together so we only waited about 20. We were sat outside after being told there were misters to keep us cool. the misters were about 9 ft high and pointing in the wrong direction so we all sat there in an uncomfortable humid state of sweat.  We asked multiple times for extra menus and place settings and did not get them until AFTER our food was served. No soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too. My friend and I ordered sake bombers and they gave us water glasses instead of bomber glasses...they said they kept breaking so they don't provide them anymore. What kind of sushi restaurant does not have the appropriate glasses for bombers? They must be really struggling financially.  Our server was dull and unenthusiastic, no desire to please. Asked for more water and got it about 15 minutes later. If I wasn't enjoying the company so much I probably would have lost it and asked to speak to a manager. Server also didn't get my friends order right and so they didn't get one of the rolls they ordered until we were almost finished eating. Also they took away the mushrooms in the veggie tempura one of my fav items, big bummer for me.  We didn't dare order desert even though we wanted it. All of us are very good tippers and we couldn't even decide if this server deserved a tip. We ended up leaving 15% instead of 20-25%. I considered that very generous.  There are way too many new sushi restaurants that contend with RA or are better for me to have any desire to go back again. I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down if they keep up that quality of service.",

They couldn't loon at my birth date??? Even speaking to be manager he would t give me the time of day.",

It brought back my childhood memories.  I've eaten at many Japanese restaurants in the past but this was the first time i have seen it on the menu.   The  chirashi bowl had a few kinds of fish chunks with some vegetables and it was good.  However, the short ribs were dry and had no taste.  It was also cold.  If you have a short lunch time you should not go there.",

    "text": "I'm really impressed with this place.  I think some people may give it bad marks because it's sums up everything beautiful and wrong with Scottsdale in one meal.  The location in Keirland, lends RA to be a haven for the Scottsdale douche elite to hang out at the chain sushi restaurant with mexican chefs, order a dynamite roll and reminisce about the time they ate the freshest yellow fin at the Grand Wailea resort on Maui.    And I got to say, I saw a couple of them there.  But sushi is a funny thing.  You can't fake freshness no matter how hard you try, and the fish here tastes like it was flown in from Japan, Alaska, or Hawaii this morning.  Blows places like Yume out of the water.  My wife and I wondered in on a Saturday afternoon and to our delight happy hour was in effect.  Long story short, we ordered a lot of nigiri, ponzu marinated sashimi, a couple of hand rolls, gyoza, and 4 beers for a total of $64 including tip.  I'd definitely come here during non happy hour, but I have to say, this is going to be my new place for Saturday afternoon indulgences.  You see, like the mexican sushi chefs that work here, Scottsdale is a bit of an anomaly.  There's no real culture here other than the one that's been put up by developers.  All the authentic real grit that resides in the Downtown Phoenix, has been washed away, polished up, and desert that used to be considered no mans land nothing is now the height of luxury in the Valley and its only getting better with time.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that beyond the Pottery Barns and the overpriced Hemingway Cigar Shop bullshit, there are local businesses that have adapted and learned like the chefs at RA and they are turning out spectacular food and doing it really well.  Don't let any other reviews change your mind.  Come down to Kierland on a hot day, sit at the RA Sushi Bar, order a cold beer, a couple pieces of maguro, and suck up all the Scottsdale ambiance you can muster.  Douche bags included.",

After showing up at the wrong location to just be told \"this happens all the time\" instead of just taking us at that location we were told we HAD to drive 22 minutes to the other location to keep our reservation. You would think since this happened all the time they had some sort of procedure in place but no.    So after driving to the other location we were seated quickly (I called and told them what happened so they knew we were going to be late) but sat without being greeted or offered water for so long that we might as well have just not been seated yet.   When we finally were approached by our server (Jayme) she stopped by the table next to us and began a full conversation while placing napkins on our table without saying a word to us but still talking to the table next to us. Not to mention after she finishes her conversation offers no apology or explanation for her terrible greeting. It was downhill from there. After taking another 10 minutes to retrieve a drink menu, we saw her a total of four times with the worst fake happy attitude it actually made us uncomfortable.  At the end of the day there are way better places in Scottsdale to get Sushi with WAY better service, so why go to RA.",

Wed they have a deal where you choose 4 small plates plus an order of edamame for $30. Also have happy hour menu and drink specials until 7 every night (I think all day Sun as well). The chili ponzu yellowtail is always amazing. Service always good. Solid sushi meal always.",

The sauces on the Tuna and Yellowtail were out of this world. Plus the price was right at HH. We also shared a Salmon Bento. It was generous and tasty!  I just wish the HH drink specials were the same. No great deals on Wines by the glass. Boohoo!",

I'm always willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and cut you some slack, but when there are only 4 tables and the place is empty, cmon. It seemed there were more workers than customers and it literally took 1.5 hours for dinner. Wtf.   10 minutes just to get waited on. Another 15 for him to come back to take our order. All pepsi products, no dr pepper or pibb (ugh!). Even the sushi on the happy hour seemed outrageous.   With so many sushi places, no real reason to come back here. Too expensive, too poor of service, good food I guess, but most sushi tastes the same to me.",

Since substitutions are sometimes about allergies that isn't super.  Anyway, I had not been here in a few months because I got really tired of how terrible the young girls taking the orders over the phones were. I decided I would give it another chance and called tonight around 4:30 to place a take out order. I gave Whitney my name and was about to place my order when I was asked if I could hold. 5 minutes later I was still holding and I hung up.  Management, train your employees on customer service. I doubt I am the only business you are losing!   It's really sad too when you love a restaurants sushi but the employees can't take a take out order and treat customers properly at off hours.  Guess next time I'm craving RA I will be driving to old town. Hopefully they are managed better and value their customers their.  Bye bye Kierland. Too many fails for the least acceptable reason.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for years and never considered it an exceptionally amazing but loved the happy hour and their crazy monkey roll. Well I decided to come here just for that last weekend. It was not busy at all which is very strange as it was prime time on a weekend night and we were seated outside. Let me bottom line it: the food has completely gone downhill and the service is TERRIBLE. Our waiter was nice but seemed kind of new because he would rarely come around to check on us... like 20 minute intervals at least. My husband didn't like his iced green tea so he asked he send it back, he forgot my husband's replacement drink order until we asked again for it. He said he \"comped\" us for the iced green tea even though we drank hardly any of it and asked for it to be sent back. He never brought us water, I had to walk inside and ask the bartender for water. He forgot the soy sauce and ramekins for our sushi, so my husband had to walk inside and ask for this as well. We're not particularly picky people but when we get a night out we expect basic service.   Now on to the food, I used to LOVE the crazy monkey rolls. I mean I craved them so much it's the reason I went there last weekend. To my disappointment, it was sloppily put together and there was more cream cheese in there than anything. It actually did not even taste good.  Long story short, due to the terrible service and decreasing quality of their food we will not be returning unless it only for happy hour drinks or something. There are far better sushi places in the area with comparable prices, Sakana is amazing for example.",

I love club music and even going to clubs on occasion, but it would be nice if there was at least an area outdoors where the soundtrack didn't feel invasive---especially since I usually go there after work to kick-back.

The six that my group ordered all derived from Califormia rolls which are safe and boring.   I ordered:  Tropical Roll with, \" Cucumber, mango & avocado rolled & topped with spinach tempura bits, spicy shrimp mixed with masago & mango salsa,\" Unfortunately the mix was so cold that it was flavorless. I tried to let it sit until last, and ate my other food, but it wasn't good. I ended up leaving it on the table.   The Ultimate Shrimp Tempura: with, \" Spicy kani kama crab mix, cucumber & shrimp tempura rolled & topped with seared tuna & avocado.\" It tasted like a california with avocado and resembled a rainbow roll. There was little flavor from the shrimp tempura,as the boring crab mix took up most of the roll  Tuna Tataki: \"Thinly sliced, seared ahi tuna; served with an onion soy vinaigrette\" This happens to be my favorite item on the menu, and is the reason I keep coming back to Ra. The sauce is perfect with the tuna, and it's sliced perfectly. Everything about this dish is perfection.  Overall, RA is a nice place to sit back and relax, but the menu is boring except for a few items. At the table there were 7 items overall, but only one warranted a second bite.",

I still LOVE their happy hour, and I am here at least once a week with friends. If there is ever a problem- and there rarely is anymore- the management fixes it at once. I still love the garlic citrus yellowtail, and have added new favorites to my list as well, including the crunchy calamari rill, zonie roll, rainbow roll, etc.  Although I still think most of their rolls are small (the zonie roll, and others), their happy hour prices make them affordable. I wouldn't go here during a regular, non-happy hour time, unless it was for a lunch special. In addition, their drinks are delicious. I like the dragon bite and the blushing geisha. I really recommend going in for their happy hour deals!  One pointer - I do not recommend sitting in the bar area. The service in that area has not improved, and you can get the same happy hour prices in the dining room area with far better service. The only downfall to the whole indoor area of the restaurant is that it is very, very loud. Also- they could improve their hostesses a little- I don't know if it is a lack of training or what, but they always seem clueless, cold and brash.",

Staff was super friendly and our server was amazing and made my friend and I feel very comfortable. He was really funny and didn't make our visit awkward at all. (You know when you go out to eat and always get that awkward server) well not ours! I believe his name was \"Ali\". That's the name on my receipt. Such a great server and even though it's a 40 minute drive there, my friend and I both agreed we would be back there soon! Thanks Ali for making us feel welcomed! And thanks Ra for giving us such a delicious dinner.",

Then when we asked for the check it took another 20 minutes for that! Every single time I come here the service is either slow, or the servers are extremely passive and rude. I likely won't be coming back. The staff is lucky I am a server as well and believe in karma or else I would have left close to nothing for a tip.",

I hadn't been to Ra in a severely long time and was pleasantly surprised and wonderfully satisfied upon this recent re-visit!  Items we ordered that I care enough to remember and am salivating at the memory are:  Beef Tataki Roll - artichoke, asparagus, roasted red pepper & avocado rolled & topped with seared beef, served with creamy wasabi & drizzled with black pepper soy OMG! Mango Lobster Roll - lobster mix, avocado & cucumber rolled & topped with thinly sliced mango, served with mango-tobiko & kiwi-wasabi sauces So Yum!!!",

Tempura rolls were something special, the others were quite good as well.   Really enjoyed it!  The service: fair.  The ordering with a checklist thing was annoying, and it didn't work well.  We ordered 4 types of rolls, only got 3, had to ask for the fourth one.  Hello?  It was in writing!  The ambience: Ouch.  Maybe it was because it was happy hour, but as we sat there the music got louder and louder.  By the time we left, it was almost to the point of pain.

However, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they chose the new location on Scottsdale road.  Tried it for the first time today and the food is still consistently great, but the new location is horrible!  Sitting on that patio is like lunching on the side of a highway!  Cars and large trucks roaring past  does not make a relaxing patio experience!  They needed to take some of their renovation dollars and build a wall with water feature to block the view of the road and the noise or at least plant some tall bushes. Not sure if the food is worth the awful patio.  So sad!!  Will miss the old relaxing location.",

His first statement to us was that he couldn't bring us water or plates because he was waiting for them to be cleaned, but eventually we would get them.  But the food was great so I wasn't sure how to rate the place. (hence the 3 stars) Got several rolls, the potsticker soup, and some drinks.  All the food was good and the atmospere was cool as well.

So I walked back to the hostess counter and stood there waiting for her to acknowledge me. Basically every time I go it's a version of this story.

We ordered unsweet tea, so she figured we would not want any sweetener. I explained that means I don't want it PRE-sweetened. Took our order, disappeared. Edamame was terrible. Salad & soup mediocre. Sushi sampler was not marked as spicy but somehow had wasabi hidden under each piece of fish. Meat was mediocre. Waitress disappeared again.   When she came back, she said that her sister had her car with a dead battery and she had to leave, and the manager would take care of us. Nobody ever came by the table.  I wandered the restaurant to find someone to refill my tea. I showed the manager, she walked away. Waiting for the replacement sushi without wasabi took forever. I asked the manager how long does it take to make RAW FISH? No response. No apologies. No discount off the bill.   When I asked for the bill, the waitress that supposedly had to leave to do something with her sister/car brought us the bill. Odd, thought she had to leave and could not take care of us with the same level of disservice that she had done so far.  Wasted $33 and over an hour and will not return.   The reason the restaurant is quiet is that we saw very few people actually eating there. That should have been our first sign. Waiting for the waitress to order, we finally got up to leave and she happened to show up as we were heading towards the door. That was our 2nd sign, we should have kept walking. When we finally left after this bad experience, we saw other restaurants nearby that seemed to be full of people eating and enjoying themselves. Pick one of those and save your time and money.",

I realize that they have a license to prepare food without gloves, but having a bandaged hand preparing it was a little unsettling. If my food had been prepared by this sushi chef, I probably would have left 2 stars.  Other than that, the Las Vegas Roll and the Tootsy Maki are both absolutely delicious.",

My nigiri salmon was so fishy that I wondered if I should be eating it raw. The rolls were assembled poorly with sloppy rice bits everywhere. The overall experience was disappointing, to say the least. I realize you are going to pay a premium at Scottsdale Quarters because the restaurant's overhead must be out of control.

The server that took our drink order initially refused to do it because \"it wasn't his table.\" Well, he took our drink order, someone else took our food order, a third person brought our food, had to flag down the hostess for a water refill, and then they \"had to get our softshell crab roll on the fly\" because \"the kitchen messed up.\"  Um no. The waiter(s) messed up. Don't blame the chef for not putting the order in. Honestly, we have given Ra a few chances over the years to redeem themselves, but when two people spend $60 for lunch we expect much better service.   The food was fine. Ra, for just \"fine\" food, this really isn't worth it.   UPDATE. Since this is the closest sushi spot to us and my car was getting work in the same plaza, stopped back in. I sat at the bar because I was alone and service was great, food was still just fine but hit the spot. Will probably stop in when I'm getting an oil change again.",

    "text": "We've been going to Ra since my daughter was 6 years old - a family tradition. The best quality here in AZ was at the Kierland location, but they closed that down so we started driving to the one in north Scottsdale that became its replacement. Might be a management thing, but the quality's gone down since that closure. Or maybe that was the time of the corporate buyout. At any rate, we have stopped going as often. Overall the restaurant just went downhill. Family favorites like the tunacado have really suffered - the tuna used to be SO fresh and of such high quality - truly memorable. Now it's the same tuna you can find at any corner sushi bar.    But the clincher is this .... my daughter's home from college and we went to Ra for old time's sake last weekend. I ordered what has always been the star of the menu, the Hamachi Kama (I know, it's not sushi, but it was AMAZING), only to be told it's been taken off the menu.    Big misstep for Ra... just one of many but this last one was sort of the nail in the coffin. At this point there is no reason to go to Ra anymore. Hamachi Kama was the last thing they did truly well - the item that set them apart from the other 50+ sushi joints in this big city. Sure, others have it, but no one does it quite like Ra did - sizable, fresh, broiled to a beautiful crisp without overcooking the center, and the sauce they served it up with was unique and stellar. Good enough to cause cravings... why would they eliminate the last great thing on the menu?  Disappointing to see this trajectory, but it looks like it's goodbye to Ra after all these years.",

The chicken might as well have just been a slab of meat as well - super awkward to eat.  I told the waiter I wasn't pleased when he asked how my meal was, and that it was just filled with all carrots... he said sorry and then asked me if he could bring me a side of broccoli or peppers.... uhhhh no.... but why couldn't you have just added that to my bowl??!!! Ughhh the logic is beyond me.  He offered me a coupon for a free roll or app for the next time I come in... thanks, but no thanks!",

My wife had a discount coupon for us to eat at this establishment and since we were in the neighborhood we decided to stop in. The place is very nice and happy hour was in full effect when arrived so that was a good thing. We had the Vegetable Tempura and Miso Soup.....both were very good. The service was decent even though they seated us near the kitchen entrance. I don't know if I need to go back but it wasn't a terrible experience at all so I would recommend it to Sushi Lovers. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!",

I'm not sure if it is under new management but the customer service was not great at this last visit for take out. Everything was fine until it came to requesting a copy of my credit card receipt. The hostess stated that she threw it away. When I insisted on a copy, she was full of attitude and stated that she didn't think I needed it because most of the guests do not. I proceeded to tell her that it was on my business account and that I needed a copy for record-keeping. Instead of reprinting it, she went and dug it out of the garbage in front of me and handed it to me. One, I was a little appalled by this considering this is a restaurant and second, I did not understand where the attitude came from. I would think it is customary to provide a receipt and to let the customer do as they wish with it.",

I was a big fan of the garlic edamame and wished I had ordered it for myself.   The waiters did mix up some orders, but it was fine since they were serving such a large group. They even made sure to make our stuff come on time. Also, they split the check for us in 10 ways, which was really kind of them!",

Then we just sat for about 15 min, we read through the menu about 3 times.  Sam, who was not assigned to our section, asked us if we'd been helped, because he seen us looking around.  We let him know we had not and he took our order.  The manager, I believe her name was Ashley came to our table and apologized for no one coming to our table to check on us and took care of our first round of drinks, our appetizer and offered us dessert!  This was the first time a manager has offered to make something right without a customer complaint.  THIS is AMAZIN customer service.  It's so rare, I had to leave a review.  Sam was great! He checked on us after we got our order, cleared our plates and even gave us good small talk.    It's unfortunate that that servers are so terrible these days that it's practically expected, but even with the short comings of the server who was assigned to our section, the manager and another team member stepped up to improve the customer experience.  Kudos to these two!!!",

I've been to RA before but tonight I had my $20 gift certificate for my half bday. I love this! I used this last year and couldn't wait to do it again. The Vegas roll is amazing! Now to the service. I initally sat inside but when my friends arrived we went out to the patio. The male server who brought me my drink inside was great! When we went outside and had a new server everything went down hill. First the server only brought us 1 menu for a table of 3 people. We had to ask for the HH menu and she dropped it down and walked away. When we ordered I asked if she could leave the HH menu there in case we wanted to order more drinks and she got an attitude with me (wasn't the first time) and told me she needed to make room on the table so she took it from me. I've noticed that the last couple of times I go to RA they leave the wasbi off of the sushi plates and I have to request for it when i receive my rolls. I had to do this last night and she again responded with an attitude and walked away. She never asked if we wanted refills. She was upset when I was trying to explain who was going to pay what with our cards. She came back with our cards she handed my check to me and mispronounced my name purposely (it's Jaime) so...  gave her my gift certificate and it seemed like the total owed was off she ignored us when we tried to call her over. She looked straight at us and kept walking. I just paid and left. I have no clue why she was in such a bad attitude but it's ashamed because I love the food and she made our experience horrible. Never going back there again and I'm going to vocalize our experience to my friends (at least not at that location).",

The other thing I discovered was their Happy Hour menu, which I must say, is probably one of the best in town in terms of prices and offerings. $1 sake, sushi like salmon and yellowtail for $2.50, generous servings for friend calamari for less then $4, shrimp cerviche for less than $5.

Granted, it's a game, but the sushi place is not a sports bar.  They should require the people to order so many drinks or some much food every hour to maintain the table... that's my only rant!

BUT.... the 2 stars state it perfectly \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  That pretty much says it all.  The sushi was okay.  Nothing special that makes me want to go back, so I probably won't unless I am shopping in Kierland and must eat a sushi roll but that probably won't happen.   Service was good.  It was that blah sushi. 2 stars.  With plenty of good sushi in town, they gotta step it up.  Do you think they do better sushi before or after happy hour like are they thinking \"ha, it's happy hour and that cheap-skate wants good sushi?!  ha ha ha\"-- I don't know.  But I'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots.",

    "text": "I've been quite happy with Ra recently. When they first opened in Phoenix several years ago, the sushi and the service were, in my humble opinion, rather mediocre. Over the years, however, the food has gotten more innovative and become very good. I am a HUGE fan of the Hot Mess (crab sauce baked with jalapenos and sweet eel sauce atop crispy rice patties) and my mom loves their grilled salmon. Their sushi happy hour has quite a bit of variety and the value is pretty good for Scottsdale. Another thing I've noticed at both the Kierland and Old Town locations is that the service is consistently excellent. There was an error in one of our orders recently and our sweet server made it right tout suite!   Yes, the acoustics....they leave a lot to be desired. I get it: it's a rock 'n' roll sushi bar so loud music is part of the ambience. If you have a hearing loss or if you have difficulty tolerating loud music - be forewarned. I actually prefer to go when it's busier because there are more bodies to absorb the sound of the music. When it's slower, those hard surfaces (tables, glass windows) really make those sound waves bounce.  Check it out!",

    "text": "Hmmm sushi in Scottsdale, Arizona...  The goods - there is usually little wait, the music is good, and the sunday specials rock my sox.  The staff is usually attentive and down to earth, and the food usually comes out pretty quick.  It is hard to find a good mojito in this darn town let alone anywhere, and they make a MEAN mango mojito.  The crazy monkey roll is my absolute favorite with a lot of flavor, but its definitely an acquired taste (if you are a nigiri lover, this is probably not the one for you).  They are open late night too which is great and hard to find in the n snottsdale area.  The bads - they are not always consistent with their fish.  Sometimes its great, other times it absolutely blows --- the nigiri is a toss up.  A seasoned sushi-er knows when something is not right; I put a piece of nigiri in my mouth that tasted way off, and what do you know it came right back up about 10 minutes later. Normally, I would swear to never return to a place that caused unnatural regurgitation, but the manager was quick to rectify the situation, covering our food on our bill and offering us a voucher for a free dinner of whatever we wanted next time we came back in [this however did not go as planned - check out my review on the ra downtown] Another time I found a bone in my salmon nigiri, definitely not ok.  The scene here too is simply obnoxious at certain hours, not as bad at this location though than others.    Its worth a try, and I do still dine here, but your money is only worth it during the happy hour specials.",

Danielle the bartender (how could I forget her name with some unexpected drunk guys coming in and shouting her name every couple of minutes) was really welcoming. By the time I left the bar had been half full and a table of 8+ was being served. I'm not staying long in the area but very tempted to come back again!  p.s.

Ordered a calamari roll and spicy salmon roll which again took 20 minutes to receive without any ginger or wasabi. The calamari was fair at best but the salmon was \"off\" and I mean it was very warm which is the last thing you want in raw fish.  The bartender asked \"how was it?\" which I informed him the salmon wasn't right and he replied \"would you like something else?\" And at his point I said \" no thank you, just the check\". It didn't make sense to wait Another 20 min for sushi that's is mediocre at its best. Bill arrives....still charged me for the salmon roll. So I paid it, and went up to the manager and told him the situation, who must be 25 years old max, and he replied \"Oh\".  Huh??? That's your response, that's your customer satisfaction?? Wow! I'm not surprised, this place is run by children throughout the entire restaurant. Weak!!",

On the off chance that the weather isn't Scottsdale-Spectacular, or you love the indoor experience, the ambiance inside is wonderful and alive, as well.  The edamame is a must to enjoy while you're waiting for your sushi.  I always order the King Crab Rolls, since I love the avocado inside, with the cucumber and crab. As with any restaurant in Kierland Commons, parking close can be a challenge, however there is a large parking lot a block to the south, and a large lot and parking garage a few blocks to the north...and after all, walking within this quaint area is part of the experience.",

She hardly came by and we had to flag her down to put in another order which took 25 minutes for 1 roll of sushi to be delivered. At the same time, we also asked for our bill  because we had already been there for an hour (2 rolls and an entree of noodles) and figured we'd get our bill before we lose her again. It took another 20 minutes between getting the bill and her swiping our card. What was supposed to be a nice evening out turned into an hour and a half of the slowest, most inattentive service I've had in quite some time. We've been here once before and had great service and sushi so it was unfortunate my experience last night was subpar.",

Daniel was the manager on duty and represented RA Sushi excellently by allowing my party to enjoy a round of happy hour drinks during regular hours. That's what I call customer appreciation.  My only complaint is my friend didn't receive his cali roll until several long minutes after we already had our plates in front of us.  Thanks",

I ate the edamame, seaweed salad, salmon nigiri, spicy salmon roll, tuna nigiri.   The rice was soft but not mushy.   And it wasn't hard, which is from not enough water added when it cooks.   UGHHH!   The salmon nigiri and the tuna nigiri were oh, so fresh.   The spicy salmon roll was quite tasty.    The edamame was, well, edamame.   The seaweed salad was similar to that premade in the grocery stores, but this version was a little tastier.   I didn't sample the rest of the items ordered, but I'm told they were delish.  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of all of the food, but what is presented is a representative example.  I would go back.   I thought I had been to a Ra Sushi prior, and didn't like it, but with or without being the first time or second, I liked it.",

Lots of salad and rice though. Two kinds of sauce, mustard and katsu come with it. I would say the chicken katsu bento and mule drinks are overpriced by a dollar or two. Mules are generally $8 in most places. $10-$12 here. Last thing, the website is remarkably slow and needs work. Maybe too many graphics, dunno. Hard to switch between menu selections. No drink prices online, not good. Actually, I don't see prices for anything.",

Sensing that we'd better stick to simpler drinks, ordered a vodka Martini, dry, olives on side. It arrived warm! Third try, I hunted down our waiter, and ordered Sake and finally discovered the bartender's strength.  We had a group of about 15. Too large for one waiter, but management must have been inspired by bartender's limited imagination. Despite the slow service, we were resigned to our one server.  Leaving, I asked the hostess to please call a cab for the remaining half dozen guests in our party wishing to leave. \"Cab?\" She asked, cocking her head like an inquisitive Spaniel. \"Yes, a Taxi,\" I replied hoping to select a term in her vocabulary. She stared, blue eyes in the headlights of antiquated language: I may as well be asking for a \"Carriage.\"  We left using Uber.",

This time around we notice that they got rid of the Sushi sheet and pencil where you can mark your order and just give to the server. I would think it's quit a bit harder on the server, especially if your party is ordering a lot. I also took note that the menus were redone to incorporate the calories to all the items (which I loved). We ordered Green Tea and a Kirin. For Sushi, we ordered Sea Urchin, Salmon, Smelt Eggs with Quail Eggs and a Yellow Tail Sashimi. All the fish was fresh and tasted good.  Always good to have a spot to stop by for a quick bite to eat for lunch.",

Our server was nice enough, but not very engaging.    We really enjoyed the pineapple cream cheese wontons - enough that we ordered a second serving!  The spicy salmon and Tootsy Maki rolls were delicious, but we weren't very impressed with the Vegas roll... it had an overwhelming strong mayo taste.  Otherwise, it would've been a very tasty roll though.  Not a bad happy hour spot, if you are looking for some cheaper sushi, but the drinks are still pretty pricey.   At the very end of our meal, our server brought over two drinks that she said they \"wanted us to try\" - nice, but there were three of us... one of us was supposed to just watch the others drink, I guess?  And unfortunately, the free drink was absolutely unpalatable - some kind of strawberry sake martini? Avoid it if at all possible.  Instead, the Mango Martini and the Shiso Naughty are much better options!",

Since RA's happy hour was only on Sunday nights, figured I'd give it a try.  The place was going on, but we were served pretty promptly.  All RA's seem the same to me... the fish is average, the ambiance is good, and if you go for happy hour, it's a steal.  We had two rolls, some nigiri, and edamame and our bill was $19.  Basically, the place is a 3* joint to me.  But they get an extra star for their Red Cross promotion.  With your bill, you can leave a donation on your card, and RA will match it 100%.  And this wasn't a one-day promo, it goes til mid-May!  Not sure if it's nationwide, but definitely come support RA as this is pretty awesome.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here for Arizona Restaurant Week.   We've never been to RA Sushi before, so we figured we'd check it out.   This is at the Kierland Commons location in North Scottsdale. We walked in and I thought it looked really cool inside. I liked the atmosphere and thought the red lights were a good touch.  Our waitress was nice, but really didn't understand the AZ Restaurant Week menu. She gave us conflicting information about it. It had been going on for at least a week but she said we were her first customers to order off that menu. Maybe she should have been trained in it better. Whatever, not a HUGE deal.  We got the pot stickers for the appetizer. It was good. No complaints there. But it reminded me of the pot stickers you sample at Costco. I wonder if they got it from there.   We ordered the Las Vegas roll and some other sushi assorted platter. The Vegas rolls were way too messy. I didn't know how to eat it with my chop sticks. Kubuki is better. The California rolls were super tiny too. I had no clue what the other thing was. I think it was salmon on top of white rice? Not impressive.  Then came desert. We got the green tea ice cream. I couldn't finish it because it tasted too bitter. My wife informed me that it wasn't bitter, but I thought it was. Maybe my pallete is off?   Anyway, it was overpriced. Our server was nice, but she didn't really go above and beyond. Would I come back? Probably not.",

Ive tried about 6 sushi places in az and been dissapointed and felt totally ripped off but ra has some great deals and quality for your money.   My favorite is the seared tuna with a sweet onion sauce and their salmon roll with asparagus. Everything is fresh and fast. The bartender Eric ALWAYS takes great care of us and always has some entertaining and morally objective stories to keep us entertained.   They USED to have a great happy hour menu but they changed it and I am not impressed . I haven't been back for hh since the change and I hope they revert to the original hh menu.   One nice touch is they are good about pouring your beer/saki in a nice cold/hot glass and refilling it as it goes down. Its the little touches that matter!",

I know it's not so \"authentic\" to the sushi purists, but the presentation of the dishes is pretty and the seasonings are terrific and everything tastes great.  Dustin has been my server a couple times and he does a fabulous job. Plus he has great skin! In fact, being lovely seems to be a server requirement here, because they all are.  The drink and food menus are very creative and extensive,  so plan to spend some time perusing.  If you are a hot, spicy pepper freak,  be SURE to order the shishito peppers!  They are a meal in themselves.   My only complaint with this place is that sometimes (well, frequently) you have to wait awhile for someone to show up at the hostess desk to seat you. This is also True for the downtown Scottsdale location. ...and they have lovely servers, too. I'm sensing a corporate theme here.",

The hostess noted we had not been servedand went to find a waiter.  There was a delay even after that point.  This did provide us with plenty of time to get our order of sushi.  When our waiter arrived he tried to leave after taking  the drink order.  I stopped him and had him take our sushi order before he wandered off again.  This level of service is what I would expect in Greece where literally I have had to chase waiters down to get a beer.  The sushi when it arrived was good.  We enjoyed the Las Vegas roll and the Gojira roll (GoJiiiirrrraaa!!!!) the most.  The fried banana desert was splendid.

We ordered cocktails first, which took ages to arrive.  Our starter arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but no soy sauce.  The server did not return and to our amazement there was not soy sauce on any of the outdoor tables, so we had to walk into the main restaurant to ask for it.     Nobody else ordered a second drink or desert as we were now sitting so long we were physically uncomfortable and just wanted to be out of there.  Waiting for the check was another unreasonably long process.    Unfortunately, poor service has become the standard at this location and with so many other choices in the area we will not return.",

The bar is right in the front and was packed at 7 on a Saturday, but they sat us right away at the sushi bar. The service was quick and the sushi chef was helpful, though it was hard to hear him (again, old).   My wife and I had the 'RA'llipop, RAckin Roll, Chili Ponzu Yellowtail, toro nigiri, salmon nigiri, king crab nigiri. My buddy ordered a watermelon and kiwi salad with shrimp and sushi that I lost track of. When we asked the sushi chef about salmon skin he told us it was 'kind of like bacon' and made some for us to try (no, not like bacon...).  The RAllipops and the Chili Ponzu were the standouts of the evening and the toro nigiri and king crab nigiri were a bit of a disappointment. The toro was a little fattier than I like (I know, some folks like that), and the king crab had a lot less flavor than I'd remembered it having and tasted a little like refrigerator.   I would have given four stars (the service was five) but for the value. I really expected knock out sushi. It was 'good sushi', at a 'great sushi' price point. (And too loud for this old man).",

The waitress was pretty nice and pretty patient with us because we spent so much time chit chatting and catching up that she had to return at least 5 times before we were actually ready to order.  My friend picked the place and I decided to give it a try cause I figured a different location might be better but the food was still just okay and the apple martinis were still very very strong.  So strong that she and I had to do some more window shopping for another hour to make sure I was good enough to drive after just one drink which is insane.  The place was very clean, I give them credit for that, but I personally feel for how bland the food was it's too overpriced.  But I'm guessing it's just me because I have many friends that can't stay away from here and love going back for more and more and more.",

One trip, I got 2 drinks, peppers, and one or two sushi rolls (which are relatively small), and I paid $60!! Yes...60 bucks for ONE person to not even get full! I then heard from a friend that happy hour is the best time to go...prices on happy hour items are a bit more reasonable. So...I went to the late night (10-close) happy hour last weekend.  We walked up and saw a few tables of people outside, and inside there were no more than a handful more...good, not too busy. There was one other woman waiting at the host stand so we stood behind her. We stood there...and stood there...and stood there.   Several times employees walked by; one even gave a polite little head nod which verified that none of us were invisible. However, even after several times of poking our heads around the dining area and toward the bar tender, no host ever came. We even walked around the fish tank at the entrance thinking maybe someone would come over out of concern that we were essentially BEHIND the host table. Nope!   After at least 10 minutes of being completely ignored we finally gave up and left. That other woman stayed. That was about a week ago. She very well may still be waiting there. We went to a different restaurant where we paid much less than we would have at RA (even at happy hour prices) and where we were served very quickly.  I have had it with RA. Food is expensive and the taste/quality is mediocre...more presentation than substance. They use tricks to make the food appear larger than it is...spreading out the pieces of sushi roll, garnishing with sauces and some items to make the dish appear taller. It looks nice of course, but when you're hungry, the aesthetics don't fill you up! Happy hour was my last attempt at allowing them to win me as a customer...and I never made it past the entrance.",

They had a DJ playing music until closing. The music was a good touch!  We came here on a Sunday night around 8:30 so we were able to catch their happy hour menu. Which had a lot of appetizers and rolls for almost 40% original price.   The chicken yakitori was delicious! The chicken was so moist and tender. The rainbow, spicy salmon and California roll were good too. The spicy salmon definitely had a spicy kick to it. We also go the sweet potatoes and asparagus tempura, the sweet potatoe was really yam. The slices of \"sweet potatoe\" were so thick it wasn't great. The asparagus was good on the other hand. The pork gyoza was yummy too! I'm getting hungry just thinking about the gyoza.   Don't get the grilled short ribs whatever you do, they were burnt and fatty. I took a bite and spit it back on my plate because it was chewable.   But pretty good sushi.",

The spicy tuna roll is a classic must have and the viva Las Vegas roll is something everyone should try! I wanted to try something different so I got the Zonie Roll and it was amazing!

The sushi is not the best on the planet but the quality of fish is good and they have the solid basic rolls that everyone loves. I really liked the sashimi platter, and I also really liked this fancy roll that didn't have rice. My favorite meal is the chicken udon. They even served our friends alcohol when they were literally closing. I think that Ra sushi is about 15% overpriced but that is my personal opinion. Most fish is pretty pricey.

They give you end cuts that are not tender they are chewy. Today the tuna is loaded with tendons. Not what you want with sashimi. You need to keep those cuts off customers plates for use them for rolls where people cannot visually see the entire cut of fish. Get your stuff together guys. After today  think I have given up on this place I think this is my last time getting Sushi here. I go to Kodo Sushi about 2 miles away which is 10 times better fresher and always take great personal care of you. 90% of time I've been here at the bar today there is no one at the bar to serve me.

The broth was so Very flavorful and just plain delicious! Then the noodles, pork, 1/2 an egg and other goodies made it just right. I also got garlic chips and corn to add in. As for the Pork Gyoza, for me the dumpling wrapper was just a little to thick and dense. Don't get me wrong, they were good just a little to heavy. Overall RA is one of my favorite restaurants.",

The sushi won't make you sick but it's not the best quality fish and often doesn't taste that great. That doesn't stop me from ordering it every once in a while when everywhere else is closed on a Sunday night (they are usually open until 12am).   The sushi rice is a bit sweet but it at least is properly seasoned with vinegar. I've had some okay sushi as well as complete misses from here - for example, my most recent poke bowl was filled with sloppily sliced cuts of tuna and salmon, with the skin still showing and sections of stringy connective tissue, rendering the fish tasted inedible. I would stick to cooked foods overall at RA rather than mediocre sashimi. I don't think it's worth trying unless you're really craving sushi and everywhere else is closed.!",

We made a reservation for Saturday night and our waiter literally forgot about us after we finished eating and tried to flag him down so many times and he kept ignoring us so we finally had to ask the hostess to get us our check, which she did do and he never came back to check on us. We had all of our dishes and plates just left on the table for whole time so we were staring at them and finally had to stack them at home. Maybe he was the only one working in our area that night? Who knows but you'd think they would staff correctly on a Saturday night or at least have him apologize at the end of the meal but he wasn't even around to do so.  It's super upsetting because it's not like this place is cheap. I don't foresee myself coming back here in the future because the hospitality was just plain bad.",

    "text": "Okay so before everyone gets all JUDGEY about the impossibly high rating I gave a sushi restaurant in Arizona that's part of a chain owned by Benihana (THE HORROR!), hear me out.  My office is located in the Kierland Commons. This can be nice when I want to blow half my paycheck at H&M during my lunch break, but it's not so nice when I NEED to blow half my paycheck if I want to be able to go somewhere walking distance from my office for lunch. Originally, I thought my most reasonable options were a $7 Asian Chicken Salad at Chloe's Corner or crossing Scottsdale Rd to get to Chipotle. That is, until I ventured over to RA today and saw what I had been missing.  For starters, they have some amazing lunch specials.  Yes, they are pricier than Chipotle but in the grand scheme of sushi, they're pretty damn good. They have a Sashimi Lunch combo that is four pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail with a miso soup and a salad for like $12.  Their Bento lunches come with so many things I can't even remember them all and cost like $9.  For the area (this mall in particular), these lunch prices are incredibly reasonable.  What I got today, the Tuna Squared Salad, isn't even on the lunch menu and it totally blew my mind that for a couple bucks more than the tuna-mayo salad over greens I get at Chloe's (which is delicious BTW but that's not the point), I could be getting a huge portion of greens topped with about 5-6 pieces of seared ahi, about 5-6 slices seared sushi-grade albacore, avocado, and cashews.  These are all very expensive things!  This should be a very expensive salad! But it's $10 and it's glorious.  Oh one more thing that I probably won't be getting while we're in the triple digits but I have had before and it's delightful: Miso Hot Soup.  Picture a huge miso soup full of shrimp and tofu and mushrooms with with a kick strong enough to clear your sinuses.  Plus it comes with these fried rice balls (I usually get it to go and they come on the side) that are surprisingly delicious. I always think I can save some calories and not eat them, but it never happens. Those suckers are in the soup by the second spoonful and gone before I'm half done, they're just that good.  All in all, no, I don't go to RA for mind-blowingly fresh, melt-in-your-mouth sushi. But I do go for decent lunch options at prices that allow me to blow money during my lunch break the way God intended: Shopping.",

I always figure it's a safe, non-threatening place for sushi in exotic decor.  But with all of the bad dates, I haven't had a bad sushi roll here. Do they salt their Edamame too much? Yeah. Are their prices a tad on steep side? Sure. But, I still dig 'em.  I will eat here again, but only in the presence of well-known fam and friends.",

We ordered family style, including spicy tuna rolls, seaweed salad, the Viva Las Vegas, soft-shell crab rolls, tempura, chicken teriyaki, and a few other things that I can't remember.  Even the sushi newbies loved all the sushi items!  They were also turned on to Asahi.    Our waitress graciously split the bill evenly 7 ways with 7 credit cards and no attitude.

Vegas roll was very generous in size, and the calamari roll had an amazing eel sauce.   Staff was very friendly and polite, the only thing that threw us off was our appetizers came after our rolls?

My friend ordered the Las Vegas roll which was a Yelp favorite. I ordered the California Roll, Edamame & Chicken Kabobs. Their happy menu varies from $2 items to $7 items (still not bad for happy hour!)  The white sake sangria was my cocktail of choice and was SO DELISH. It was fruity, fresh and hit the spot.

I ordered the shrimp calamari tempura roll, shrimp tempura roll, scallop nigiri, sweet shrimp w/head, and spicy tuna handroll. We have never ordered sushi to go, but we figured it would be good considering it was a 25 minute wait. Peering into the bag we noticed there were several containers. Although one stood out to us. Half were green and half were pink. We didn't think anything of it, just thought it was a different style. Let's just say waaaay too much cream cheese. As we took our first bite, we realized we messed up and went to the wrong place. The food was mediocre at best. Scallop was too chewy. Rice was too sticky. This sushi was definitely made by someone who watched too much anime. The interior of the restaurant looked like the red light district too. It is safe to say that I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone, not even my worst enemy.  Maybe they'll hire some real chefs one day and make some real sushi. xoxo-gossip girl",

When we showed up for reverse happy hour on a weeknight I had a reservation which I showed up ready to announce to the host. We stood there for 4 minutes before the bartender actually asked if we planned on sitting, I said yes so he said he would go find someone to help us. After getting our hostess, I informed her of our dinner reservation and that we were there for happy hour. She then sat us without a happy hour menu and gave us an ordering sheet to fill out....without a pen or pencil. Not off to a good start RA. Might I add I've always been a little against commercial sushi restaurants, and so far...this was reinforcing the reasons why. BUT the server we then had was amazing! Very sweet and attentive, always asking if we needed anything else and if we had any questions.  ....The food was okay.  I had ordered a yellowtail roll and spicy salmon roll, both were fishy tasting. More than any other place in Scottsdale that I've tried.  My boyfriend I really enjoyed the Zonie roll, which was my favorite and the Las Vegas roll which was my boyfriends and I must say, has a great presentation. If you plan on coming here, sign up for their \"hooked up\" email list and get new menu updates as well as free gift cards.  I won't be returning, try the sushi at stingray across the street at Scottsdale Quarter.",

In the description it says it lays down avocado, shrimp, salmon and another fish to make it look like the colors of the rainbow. I thought this meant that every individual roll was going to have all this fish but it was just spread across the 8 rolls. The color of the fish was very bland and there wasn't even avocado slices on each roll. It in no way resembled a rainbow and even tasted more bland then it looked. I really enjoyed the nigiri though and our server was nice just not very attentive. It was pretty slow when we were there and I saw him just standing around talking to other employees. Which is fine cause I'm a server too but when your table needs something and you see your server just shooting the breeze instead of doing their job it's a little annoying. All in all it was an average experience, might come again and try their happy hour and some other rolls besides the rainbow one!",

Although, after my recent visit to this particular Ra Sushi location I am entirely done with them.   Was in the area and saw the restaurant from the street and decided to drop in. I was by myself so decided to sit at the bar. First, it took a while for me to be greeted... From the get go the bartender (Jennifer) wasn't warm, friendly, nor accommodating. The initial interaction with the bartender would hold True for my entire experience.   After being greeted I put in my drink order. The drink did not take long and was actually made very well. The issue was the horrendous customer service. I was three sips into my drink and the bartender (JENNIFER) brought me my tab.... Mind you, this was around 8:00 PM on a weekday... no close coming around the corner nor did I indicate I was there for just one quick drink. This coupled with the fact that she had an overall rude attitude towards me was upsetting. No customer ever wants to feel rushed.   While at the bar I was never checked up on one time. No, \"how's the drink...\" \"Here is your bill. No rush sir.\" \"Would you like anything else?\" \"Thanks for coming in\" ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I was also never asked if I wanted a menu. I received dirty looks to boot???   I typically like to stay on topic and never reference other reviews as a 3rd party... Although, one needs only read through this restaurants review to see they have a major issue with service that they have obviously yet to properly address.   I will not be spending my hard earner money with this business again. If you value good customer service and professionalism I recommend you stay away from Ra Sushi.   Disappointed.",

The server was fine- not too friendly, but did his job.  We started with pineapple cheese wontons which ended up being the highlight of the whole meal.  Next we had the tunacado, the scallop dynamite roll and the chili ponzu yellowtail.  They were all just average- which is really what I feel about this whole restaurant- its just average.  To top it off the restaurant was freezing!  I know its hot outside, but everyone in the place was cold and they did not bother turning the air down as we requested.  There are better places -even in Arizona-for the same price or even less.",

I actually couldn't finish my drink and left it on the table. Our food was tasteless except for the excessive salty sauce that made our food inedible. The food was so bad, we didn't even attempt to try dessert.   We left for another restaurant to get dessert and get the salty and horrible taste out of our mouth!

We thought we would try again last night and all I can say was what a waste of money.   To start we sat down and the music was blaring like a night club. We asked the server if we could move or it could be turned down just a little. She said \" I don't have the authority to adjust music\". Also all of the tables outside where covered in old plates and napkins. Probably 5 dirty tables where near us and where not cleaned during our stay as their was only one server for the lounge and patio. Pretty hard to dye your job when you are so short staffed. We finally were moved outside and then had to wait 15 minutes to have a heater turned on. No offense but it's Scottsdale in the winter. Every restaurant in Scottsdale has these on and working in the winter.   The food didn't make anything better. I had the Vegas roll which took about 30 minutes and my girlfriend had the spicy salmon roll. Which came out once I was done eating about 45 minutes after ordering. Once her food came out she knew it wasn't what she normally has here and walked it back to the server. She received quite a bit of attitude and eventually decided she just wanted to leave and not have another roll.  The manager came out a little while later(he had to finish his sake he was drinking at the bar). He kept asking if we were happy and full and we said yes so we could get out of this poor experience. What I should have said was how can she be full when she walked food back to you as she didn't like it and how can we be happy when we are sitting around 3 dirty tables and waited almost an hour for sushi.   We use to come here a good amount but our last two experiences where so poor I think we will find somewhere else to go for late night dining. Really a shame as we both work late hours and use to enjoy late night happy hour. I think we would try it again if the management team actually cared and tried to improve the service or maybe schedule enough staff not to burn out the server they have and given decent service.",

Never been a huge fan of Ra considering I feel there are other better sushi restaurants around, but the majority wanted to go here so I went.  Definitely good happy hour prices but still not all that great.  I ordered for the hubby and I:  the chicken wings, tootsie maki roll, Ra-ukin Shrimp and korean bbq short ribs.    I honestly don't have a lot to say about this place because there is nothing sticking out of my mind.  For all of that, my bill came to $33 including an 18% gratuity.",

But it is grossly unfair to allow other customers to cut in line ahead of folks who have been waiting patiently. Fortunately there are many dining choices in the neighborhood and Phoenix as a whole so we ate a great meal somewhere else. We may try you again someday, but I doubt it. Good luck competing with restaurants that value their customers. There still are a few around.....  In response to an email that I sent directly to RA, I received a prompt reply from the GM. I would like to commend him for his attentiveness to my concerns. I understand that situations may happen when customers feel slighted, but when managers step forward to apologize and attempt to right a wrong, customers should grant them the credit that is due. Thank you Mr Stidham for a job well done! I will visit RA the next time I return to Scottsdale.",

Tonight was our 4th dinner this week with Ra supporting Nicky's Week and the work of St. Jude Children's Hospital.  From the moment our server Dan walked up to our table with a black eye, to his rubbing his eyes while he was taking our order began this unfortunate experience with his equally blase attitude.  Dan proceeded through our dinner service to walk to the end of the bar and lift his shirt to show off his stomach, which he was apparently impressed with, to one of his co-workers.  Empty water glasses, empty ice tea and having to flag him down to ask for the check was simply the icing on the cake.  This was all under the less than watchful eye of what we had to assume was a male manager who was equally disheveled in his appearance.  We can only surmise he was a manager based on hearing him apologize to the table behind us for their dissatisfaction.  When we left the restaurant \"the manager\" was comfortably seated at the end of the bar doing absolutely nothing.    We left a shockingly low tip that hopefully conveyed our displeasure to Dan and left the remainder as an increased donation to the memory of Nicky and the great work of St Jude.  Over the years we have certainly come to expect much more from a service standpoint than your Kierland team offered this evening.  We will not be back to this location in the near future.",

Also, their half birthday deal is amazing, but I come here instead of the better old town location because it's closer to my house.  Other than the service, the sushi chefs are nice and it's very clean. Oh, but I will note that a lot of the time when I walk in and stand in front of the hostess table, the hostess will be missing and I'll have to wait a long time before someone realizes I'm there...

Was told by the GF that the spciy mitso was similar to something she had in Japan.    The other great thing was their happy hours:  10 to midnight.  So while surrounding restaurants are cleaning their kitchens to close for the night, this place is just getting started.  Now for the bad:  we never got around to ordering a main, because of the ghetto Muzak that was being piped onto the outdoor patio area, inside, even in the bathrooms you could not get away.  Are these people serious?  Nothing like hearing the lyrics \"you gotta lick it, before you stick it, you gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it\" (yes, that song from a previous decade is now in a cheesy extended club mix version playing exclusively at Sushi RA)....how nice it is to hear such words as you contemplate which raw fish to order.  I don't think so.  I looked around but did not see a dance floor...although I did notice a couple behind us with 2 young girls which made the whole scene seem entirely inappropriate.  I thought for certain they must be offended, but realized much later, during a short break in the music, that they were speaking French and seemed entirely oblivious to the lyrics being pounded out.  The management of this place need to mature a little bit.  I have been to places like this in Manhattan, where they think they can survive on great food and reputation forever, and that people will tolerate any attitude and disrespect for the sake of it.    The bottom line: this establishment serves 5 star food while pandering to 1 star clientele.  I was surprised to hear they have been around for 8 years.....",

Our waiter took more than 4 minutes to even come to our table and greet us and take our drink orders. Just a little information before I go on....this was at 3pm on a Saturday and they were not busy AT ALL.  He finally gets our drink order (sodas) and it takes him a while to deliver them.  We place our food order, several minutes later we get our food but never received our soups as our appetizer.  That got corrected after bringing it up to our server.  Now all our drinks were empty and needed refilled.  We had to flag him down and ask for refills, he had his hands full so would be \"right back\".  He didn't come back, we had to again track him down to get more soda.  While we were waiting I went to the restroom, it was gross, papertowels overflowing and trash on the floor.  The restaurant itself looked a lot like this also.  There were wrappers and debri all over the dining area.  You would think being in North Scottsdale Keirland things would look nicer.  We will be sticking to the south scottsdale location where we know we get great service and the place is clean!",

This Ra location could not be in better company (Sapporo's, Cheese Cake Factory, Mastro's Ocean Club, Morton's Steakhouse) all located within walking distance. Our server was very helpful and full of suggestions when we asked for them. It's always an added bonus to have a good looking staff as well. Hannah is by far the best server in the place. She's always quick and very attentive and she has a very pleasant demeanor, and she looks....well, seductive. Unfortunately, as is the case with many chains, the beer line up could use some improvement. How about some Labatte's Blue, Sagres, or Sam Miguel for example? Come to think of it, the wine needs a polish as well. Some Gazela, Lotengo, or Villa Maria would fit in nicely with the current line up. I mean it's not like were trying to dine in North Korean now is it? Overall the food is a solid B. Teriyaki chicken, rolls, tempura, you name it and Ra has it. The rolls are pretty reasonable, especially the regular rolls. As far as proximity goes, Ra is at the top of the heap, considering that Barcelona is just two blocks away.",

We got two sushi rolls and i laught when the waitress brought them to the table. These were the smallest rolls I had ever seen and it was not a half portion cause of happy hour or anything. They were as big around as a quarter. No Kidding! I was really wanting to pig out on some sushi rolls but after seeing those we just ordered teriyaki chicken which I have to say was good. Teriyaki is not my favorite but this was alright. I most likely will not be back but if I find myself there I will get a dinner entree and not the sushi. Drinks were stiff and delicous and waitress was good and friendly. Nothing good  to say for the sushi and thats sad when the word sushi is in the name of the restaurant.",

    "text": "I have family in Scottsdale and I think that I've eaten here literally every time I see them.  Last night was no exception, so off to Ra's happy hour we went.  They've recently changed their menu, so the happy hour offerings were different as well.  They have a few more drinks on special, but I went with the white sake sangria which is always a favorite.  Edamame was good per usual.  But, the new offerings are what blew us away.  The shisito peppers were probably my favorite part of the meal.  They were simple, but every bite was spicy and filled with garlic. Also new and garlicy, were the garlic sugar snap peas.  These were cooked well and very good.  The dengaku tofu is an old favorite.  I have to praise Ra for the amount of vegetarian dishes on their happy hour.  There were more options than we ended up ordering and that is extremely rare on most menus.  My only complaint with the new menu was the vegetable roll.  They seemed to have gotten rid of a standard veggie roll with cucumber, carrots, and avocado wrapped with nori.  The new roll is wrapped in rice paper and had artichoke hearts, and iceberg lettuce and a few other things mixed in.  I like that they tried to give it a new spin, but sometimes you really just want the classic.",

Well I go to the one in Old Town scottsdale a bit but mainly in Kierland so thats what this is about.  smile hour- is great , they offer super deals on drinks and food during the happy hours so you cant beat it.  Service and smiles- I highly recommend sitting at or in the bar for the best service. The ladies seem to have worked there for a long time and rock out the drinks and conversation.  Aroma- although most sushi places have a smell to them the down side of sitting at the bar is you get the normal smells plus thestale beer of the bar, but I think its such a great place , you get over it real quick. PLus you can always sit on the patio and people watch , which is the BEST!  Nom Noms- Miso soup, Las Vegas Roll( not my fav but every person I know lves it) , caterpillar rool and any sashimi, will always be fast and fresh. Never a complaint there.  Break it down Jess- Its corprate so they cant really screw up but of all the RA's I have been to cleanliness, service, staff and vibe, this is by far the best . Hopefully I will see you there.",

It took me a couple tries to appreciate it.  the desert roll (bananas fried and topped with fruits, w/ a hint of white chocolate chip) was surprisingly good.

She had known my brothers and I were wanting to eat and I went to a table that was already prepped to get my silverware. At first I thought maybe because we came in at 11 and they're about to close in another hour. But it couldn't be that since she was a way better server to two other people who came in later than us. She immediately got them plates and silverware. Once our food came she came midway bringing soy sauce and such. We had only gotten one little bowl to pour it in. We all double dip so I just put my soy sauce on my plate. The food was good, the service not so much. Very tempted to write her name down but I don't know, maybe she was having an off night.",

Although the happy hour menu looks like it has been expanded, the quality of food has clearly diminished.  Our sushi roll (spicy yellowtail) looked like it was rolled by a 3rd grader.  Additionally, it was barely filled with any fish!  I can't believe that a reputable restaurant could serve something that looked so puny.    We will not be returning in the near future.",

It was early around 5:00pm and the hostess wouldn't give us (wife and 3 yr old) a booth because they were saving it for a party of 5 or more, but the interesting thing is that they seated a party of three after us and the other booths were empty up until the time we left.    Our waitress really could care less if we enjoyed our food or if we wanted more.  My wife had god knows what in the bottom of her water cup and nicely asked her for another water, no sorry or here's your water she just put it down on the table and walked away.  We ate and she didn't check to see how our food was and if we needed anything.  About 30 mins later she said to us you're done right, can I bring your check...I'm thinking to myself no desert or do we want anything else???    Now the food, they had plenty of sushi chefs and our crunch rolls tasted like they had been made and put in the walk-in for an hour.  The fish was cold, but the quality tasted stale. I have been to RA in California countless times and the experience was completely the opposite and went there all the time.  Not going back here and if you go buyer beware.",

The manager then came by and apologized and again asked if we would just like to cancel. Again we said we would just like it to go. I let my team head back to the office and I stayed to wait for the food. An hour and 15 minutes after walking in the manager came to me with our lunch bagged up. He apologized and said it was on the house. I felt good at this point that at least they were making it OK.

The back up bussers are always spot on to clear the evidence of my gorging. Thank you for letting me look dainty!  This is my fave HH location. Great people watching. We all know their lunch specials are the bomb, especially the bento boxes. My faves that aren't on HH are the lobster spring rolls and the Gojira roll.

She just started closing the window which I thought was very rude. I asked if they were closing the bar cause clearing she seen me and decided just to shut us out.  I heard the manager say to the bartender \"it's up to you\" and she replied with \"well everyone's cold.\" And didn't even respond to me they both just shut the window on us. I run restaurants the manager should of found a solution and simply turned on the heat inside. It was Friday night so I went to Goldie's instead and had a way better experience ! My bartender there treated me with great vibes and WANTED to make that $100 tip I gave her. I will never go to RA sushi when the bartender from last night is working. She had a negative vibe and didn't even care to serve me or find a solution for me. The vibe truly sucked and I see why it was so dead on a Friday night. It's Friday night and the manager should be in control and not let the employees decide when they want to do their job or not. RUDE. Why have the window open in the first place? LAME.",

    "text": "First off - sushi in Phoenix?1? At least, that was what I was thinking when I walked by this place, which looks like a decent place to stop in, but I will admit, I hesitated a bit. After glancing at the menu and seeing the sushi that was on peoples' plates, though, I was convinced it was worth a try.  If you're staying at the nearby Westin Kierland Resort, this is totally worth it - prices are good, beer is cold, and they have a huge menu, full of options for everyone, even the non-sushi eaters in your party. (I was visiting with a total vegetarian friend, and he said his meal was great...)  I started off with the garlic edamame. I know, you are asking yourself, \"What the hell is GARLIC edamame?\" It's awesome stuff, is what that is. You need it. Get it. It has a bit of a bite to it, but it's hardly prohibitively spicy. It's loaded with garlicky spicy goodness. Great choice.  Then, I proceeded to order about 1/3 of what I usually get, in order to get a feel for their quality. I ordered 2 pieces each of salmon roe (ikura), fluke (hirame), yellowtail (hamachi), and salmon (sake) nigiri, expecting middle of the road quality fish that was at best OK. Surprise! It was awesome! The quality of the fish I had cannot be overstated. Each piece of sushi was served at the correct temperature and was a smooth mouthful of deliciousness - this is no fast food or supermarket sushi joint. I just had to go back and get more hirame and hamachi; they were that good. I also indulged in their crunchy calamari roll, which I must say is a bit gimmicky, but also totally delicious - go for it.  We finished with their version of a creme brulee, and it was tasty. Overall, a super unexpected find. I had to force myself to try a different restaurant the following day for lunch, because I could totally see myself coming here for ALL of the meals during the conference. I am happy to say - YES, sushi in Phoenix!!",

    "text": "RA Sushi is a fun place to go and it has a great Happy Hour!  We came here yesterday on Father's Day for brunch and were seated very quickly. I am not a big fan of the Americanize sushi craze. I was brought up on the old school counter seats and conveyor belt setup, with different colored plates. But, RAs does a nice job and has a well deserved reputation for good sushi and as an after work watering hole.    We started with Edamame, which was very flavorful.  Our waiter was eager to help, offering to tell us everything he knew about the menu and sushi.  Over the top for sure, but very nice just the same.  The sushi portions are the Americanized thick cut with an exaggerated piece of fish that hangs over the rice on either side. I was less impressed by California Rolls which are made with a crab salad, rather than strips of crab.  It also had a fishy taste. If you are sushi purist, you might not enjoy it.   We skipped their famous Sake Bombers, since it was before Noon. But we had a very nice Father's Day and enjoyed the atmosphere of RA's.  Our bill came to a reasonable $19.00 per person, including taxes and gratuities. So, Three Stars \"A-OK' in Yelp-ese.",

Waitress never stopped by to check on us after the food came out, which came out super quick but nothing past that.  Had the Hot Mess, would have been nice to get a refill on water too.

The last time I ordered take out, I called the manager after I opened the bag and looked at the to go boxes. I always get the RA chips and salsa and it is always a nice decent portion. That time it was significantly smaller. Now, I normally wouldn't call and complain, but the serving size I received was ridiculous. He said he would note my call and my complaint in the manager report and have someone contact me via email. That never happened. So, a few weeks have passed and I decided to give them another try tonight. I ordered what I usually do in hopes of the last time being a fluke. It was WORSE than the last time!! Literally 3 tablespoons of the tuna. I won't be going back which is a shame because I was regular. It shows that the management doesn't care.",

    "text": "In the past few months, RA Sushi bar moved from Kierland Commons a little south on Scottsdale BLVD and I was a little bummed.  I actually like the new location though!  Parking is more convenient, plus they are open until midnight which is sort of rare in the early closing city of Scottsdale.  Their staff is VERY professional and friendly.  My waitor had just started working there that week, but I could tell he was very well trained and had previous experience.  We did discover that we were very opposite in terms of political views, however, he was very respectful of my beliefs and I did the same.  They have gluten-free tamari sauce and organic rice as an option.  While this restaurant is typically outside of my uber-healthy restaurant options, the avocado roll and noodle soup works for me.  I sometimes go there to impress special dinner guests or sometimes I go there for my everyday \"work on my laptop\" nights.  If I had one complaint, it would be that the room is sometimes dark but my eyes adjusted after a few minutes and the music can be a bit loud, but often they will turn down the volume if I ask (yes, I'm getting to the age where the music is too loud).  This is definitely an upper-end sushi place and offers the same high quality that you would expect from other RA Sushi locations.  Check the website for Sunday Brunch and Happy Hour specials.",

That's a normal app for an Asian place. It would be nice to see more meat appetizers as my friend I usually go with doesn't like seafood. We like going here because of the drinks and app specials. I like the sushi here, but they should have more variety for people like my friend who don't want to just eat sushi.  The service was pretty good. It wasn't the best but it wasn't bad.

Like every Ra location, the service is spotty, hit and miss.  Best value: the sashimi entree. You don't get to pick the selection, but compared to individually priced nigiri, the value is there. It comes with one cup of miso soup which is meh.  Skip the beef short rib bowl. $15 is over priced. And, it's beef, not pork. And, it's very fatty and tough as nails. Biggest mistake next to the Ra chips 'n salsa mash up.  Still going to be a regular. They have the best sushi in town. Just have to know what to order - and what to skip - and put up with servers who don't always care about anything.",

Millennial as host   Asked if we could have a booth, was told they had two reserved.  So a family of four put at small table . Over the course of our meal six were still open. And I am so tired of hearing sorry guys. Stop calling me guy. 3. Menu -completely changed, portions are small, not sure why people come here. If you are a sushi foodie this is not your place. It used to be my place years ago but it has changed drastically. 4. Not friendly. They say hi, but don't stop and talk to me, I am human too. Waiter ok but was doing his job.   5. Wasted space. They have a huge place where the sushi chef makes food, it would be a great space for food bar stools and TVs 6. Sushi grade is poor. My daughter gagged on her sushi roll.  My roll was not fresh. Seaweed is old.  It should melt in your mouth if fresh   Sorry for the bad review. We moved to Seattle five years ago. We were back to visit family and friends this week. We used to eat there all the time. Such a letdown.",

There is a nice big patio which is great when there is nice weather and good for people watching!! The staff is always nice, no complaints.  RA has a great happy hour and reverse happy hour, one of the best around! The \"ra\"ckin shrimp is pretty tasty and very crunchy. I also like the chili ponzu yellowtail, although you can probably find better cuts elsewhere. The sushi never wows me, but it's good, I've never sent anything back, and I always leave full.  Overall, I don't come here for the best sushi in Phoenix, but I keep going back for the happy hour -it's totally worth it!!",

    "text": "Ive always enjoyed Ra, and I love the new location and environment since they left Kierland.  However, I feel like their quality has gone wayyy downhill. I went there the other night and ordered a few specialty rolls. The rice was \"mucky\" and \"mushy\". The scallop dynamite roll had more chunks of onions ontop than actual scallops. It was awful! This is the 3rd time going there after the relocation that I have had less than stellar sushi. I probably wont be going back.  The other thing I would like to say and this goes out to the management..... I like to go and sit at the bar. Many people (usually women) want to place their purse, jacket, etc on an empty bar stool to either \"save it\" or so someone wont sit next to them. This has happened several times when I have gone to RA. If people dont want people sitting next to them, Get a table! Management should take note that these folks that do this are taking up a PAYING CUSTOMERS spot! ANd puh-lease!! SItting at the bar is a fun way to make new friends!!",

    "text": "My family of 5 visited RA Sushi around 7pm on a Sunday. We didn't have reservations and the restaurant was exceptionally busy so that is where we ran into a lot of snags, or so the server said. We waited for 30 minutes for a table, which was fine because we hadn't seen each other in so long. We were seated and waited another 30 minutes for edamame and miso soup. Our server brought out our rolls in varying order, not timing the dishes at all. The Vegas roll was mediocre at best, overwhelmed by cheap flavors and additives like cream cheese. I got the spicy yellowtail roll which should've been divine, but tasted like tuna salad from Subway. We had to ask the server for wasabi and ginger, sushi house stables everywhere else. The server also forgot one of our rolls and after telling us she forgot it, brought a completely different roll 40 MINUTES LATER. She didn't apologize but instead gave us a voucher for a free app or sushi roll but told my sister \"they may not take it because it says it's expired.\" I just don't get it. For $100 worth of sushi, totally not worth it. Bad service, bad rolls, no hospitality...the polar opposite of my experience with RA Sushi in Chicago.",

So he decided to bring me to RA. As an appetizer we ordered the steamed edamame as well as the Pineapple Cheese Wontons. The edamame and the wontons were very good, the pineapple sauce for dipping was bomb. I highly recommend those. For lunch I ended up having the RAcking Roll and the California Roll. I loved the RAcking Roll, very delicious and the shrimp on top of the roll was amazing. I absolutely, loved it. The California Roll just seemed so basic to me, don't get me wrong - it was good. But after consuming the RAcking Roll, I wanted more flavor and taste. All and all, our experience was very good. The waitress was nice and we had great service. I would definetly return again!",

Honestly I thought this was another much fancier place, but it was close and the food wasn't bad the last time we came.  We were seated immediately and had reservations that definitely were not necessary for a Tuesday afternoon.  We didn't get a better table because of the reservations and it looks like we missed the happy hour specials.  We ended up getting an appetizer, the Zonie Roll, the spicy yellow tail roll, and the Pacific roll.  The rolls themselves were creative and OK.  The fish wasn't super fresh but the rolls had good flavor to them.  Definitely not a place I'd go to WOW someone, more like somewhere we'd go if we were lazy.  The Happy Hour specials looked cool, and they do a reverse happy hour which is also fun.  Our rolls took FOREVER to come out though, to the point that the birthday party to the right of us with about 15 people got their food first even though we were seated first.  They apologized twice and took a roll off the bill, but still it didn't leave a great taste in our mouths.  The sushi didn't either.  So Meh, we thought it was alright.  Unlikely to be back.  Sushi you remain an elusive mistress in Phoenix.",

Place is packed with silk and the men who love them....to our amazement we were seated right away albeit next to the kitchen but oh well...  RA is a place for redefined sushi, tetaki, sashimi and assorted japanese style choices...we tried most of their specialty plates from the happy hour menu and a couple of signature rolls from the menu.  I tried to dislike the food, but, it's good!  And you cannot beat the prices for happy hour!    Turns out the taping was a charity event for a young man battling cancer, proceeds from a special menu were being donated by RA.  Kudos for that!  RA isn't my kinda thing but I would go back for happy hour or late night...the scene is a little too moda LA for me.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of RA and this was my first visit to this location. I went with a friend and my daughter during happy hour so I expected it to be busy. When we arrived we gave our name to one hostess and she said they were cleaning a table so we should be seated shortly. About 5 mins later another party of 2 arrived and they gave our table to them so we ended up waiting another 10 mins for a table. We ordered and wanted our appetizer first but they ended up bringing our sushi first and our appetizer last!?? Our waiter was horrible obviously he wasn't hired for being a good waiter. He cared more about flirting with us and other guest. When it was time to pay we split the bill and he never brought back change. I tried getting his attention but he didn't care. I was to fed up to wait for my change. He definitely didn't deserve that $10 tip on a $35 bill. Beside the bad service the sushi was great which is why I give them 2 stars. They need to train the staff with better customer service.",

    "text": "So, after the assplosion, I think I'd better write my review! Sucked as soon as we walked in.  Party of 5.  Approximately 1pm.  Not busy.  2 four-top and one 2-top tables empty, plus the sushi bar.  They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table.  We suggested just taking a 4-top.  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila!  We were seated.   Drink order got taken quickly.  Our waitress, Sarah, hated us from moment one.  Got our drinks, placed our orders.  I've never waited so long for sushi! I had the tempura box lunch special, and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste.  One girl is allergic to gluten, so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper.  It came wrapped in rice.  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber.  Huh?  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice.  Luckily, we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper.  It was a WAY smaller serving than the original. She was great about refilling our drinks, but just wasn't as friendly (meaning not at ALL) as any other server I've ever had. This place sucks ball and I won't be back. Now, Back to the assplosion...",

The rolls were sloppy, the fish could have been fresher and the service was a little slow and inattentive.   The fish isn't cheap and there's not even a whole lot of character.  Thank god I'm not 16.",

Perfect for chilled healthy food in the AZ summer, especially during Happy Hour when the Sushi & drinks are deeply discounted.  The food & service are consistently fabulous, and the atmosphere fun.  Fun to shop till you drop at the Kierland shops afterward.",

My husband had the New Zealand roll and I had the Salmon Teriyaki so I could try a benton box which I had never had before.....it was nice but next time I think I will order a roll as I sampled some of the New Zealand roll and it was delicious. The music was fun but just a little too loud....it was killing my appetite and making me want to go dancing instead! lol There were a few nice wines to choose from on the menu and our waitress was very good!....will return again.",

In total they have over 20 items to choose from - sushi and appetizers, most under $5.  I believe it runs from 3p-7p.  Good looking wait staff and a nice decor.    Agreed - walking around Kierland is a nice way to work off lunch, or perhaps across the street to the Westin.  We'll be back for happy hour again!",

The reason why it only gets 2 stars in my book. Turn the fucking music down! The tech music they play sucks! It is hard to hold a conversation with that shit turned up to \"11\" If you can handle that then enjoy.",

I would recommend coming in during happy hour or getting there lunch card and coming in for lunch. They offer a lot of fun and creative rolls which you won't find anywhere else such as the Arizona roll or my friends favorite the Crazy Monkey Roll. Overall if you want a young atmosphere with some good sushi RA is your place.",

Ma got pork katsu bento box and it finally came out as sis and I were finishing the bowl that I had ordered full of raw fish. We were a bit scared at first, but the shrimp, tuna, yellowtail and salmon were in perfect bite sized pieces over rice and accompanied by tasty vegetables. It was a winner even to sis who claims to hate salmon. The pork was a letdown, but saved by the salad's it was served over and next to. Ixnay the pork and everything was perfecto!",
