Since we had driven out of way to eat here we stayed anyway.  Tried two smoothies - Green Peace and Tropic Thunder.  I really liked the Green Peace with avocado and spinach.  The kids liked the Tropic Thunder - I didn't get to try it.  Also had the buffalo cauliflower wrap... with a regular tortilla and with a gluten free tortilla.  It was very tasty and different.  Was impressed with the gluten free tortillas until they get hard, then they are hard as a rock.  Didn't care for the hummus... too chunky and thick.  The salad was very basic as a side to the sandwich.  Tried the Dan Dan Noodles and really liked them, even the fake meat on top.  My kids refused to eat the food so I can't imagine I will be back very often.",

Choocolate made from scratch...it had to be real raw cacao powder, it was the best mocha I've ever had. Awesome to be able to have the cleanest and tastiest version in my area!",

I loved the ambiance of this restaurant, and the food from the one breakfast burrito of scrambled tofu and veggies was so delicious, I would have loved to give them a higher rating.  The friendliness of the staff person taking the order was not mean or rude or anything, just lacking that friendly touch.  He didn't seem very enthusiastic.  Then the wait time took forever, it seemed.  Anyways, I went back on a different day to try out some of their sweet treats that were displayed in a case.  I figured since you just have to point and pay, it would be worth the drive.  It was!",

We had a delightful time ordering, total niceness at the register. We all went and sat down, we were the only ones in  the restaurant. Keep in mind they close at 8. When 8 finally rolled around, they turned the lights off. You know, the universal signal that we want you to leave? Ok, I get it. It's Friday night, queen wants his cocktails. But honey, I just paid 34.00 for some tacos and a salad, plus a3 dollar tip, and you are going to try and rush me out the door? Oh no. Rude. I don't pay 40.00 for poor service. I pay 40.00 for amazing service. Oh and when we were on our way out, I asked if we could still buy a desert, nope! The guy who I think was the manager, oh no honey, don't mess with this queen. Go to pomegranates, better service, some menu items are much better. My tacos and salad were mediocre at best. I have had some amazing food here, but not last night. AveraThe actual staff member I was interacting with, well she was a doll, but any manager of a successful restaurant knows how to treat customers properly. I'll be surprised if this place lasts for long if this is typical. Bye. (Not going back)",

It's a beautiful and spacious restaurant with local art for sale on the walls and fresh flowers on each table.    They have a selection of teas, juices, smoothies, and sparkling water--don't expect a soda fountain here!  They also have a tempting dessert case filled with chocolates, cakes, and cupcakes.  Yum!    I ordered the broccoli curry stir fry--peanut coconut rice noodles, bok choy, carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli served over a bed of fresh greens.  Great flavor, portion size, and not too pricey.  Filled me up...but still had room for dessert.  Tried the coconut lime cupcake which was really good!  Will definitely be back!",

With that being said, I LOVED 24 Carrots. Definitely a place to check out even if you don't always eat Vegan or Vegetarian.  Boyfriend and I started with the chicory Kapi, a green peace smoothie, and cold brew coffee. All awesome. Boyfriend was particularly pleased to have multiple banana-less smoothie options, since he has a banana allergy.  Split a few dishes with friends. Tried the Dan Dan Noodles, Quesadilla, and the Buffalo Cauliflower Wrap. Dan Dan noodles had a ton of flavor and a good amount of spice. Part of the magic for me was the various ways that they prepared fruits and veggies to add flavor to the dishes. The seasoned jackfruit in the quesadilla was amazing, as was the yummy buffalo cauliflower. I would eat any of the three as a stand alone meal.  Ended the meal with the raw chocolate peanut butter raspberry cup and a lavender cupcake. Both were bomb.  All in all, I would go back in a second and definitely plan on it if life brings me back to Phoenix. Thanks for a truly tasty introduction to what Vegan food can be, 24 carrots!",

Walnuts are just too bitter to make the dish edible.also the tacos use walnut meat, bitter again. Not edible. They need a way to tone down the bitterness. Try soaking in milk. Then squeeze excess liquid.this has worked for me in past to tone down bitter product.  Also the spring rolls were dry inside, good variety of veg lots if carrots,  but adding cucumber would bring moisture making it more enjoyable. I had the Vampiro juice w red beets it was great. Next visit they used golden beets. Did not like the flavor. It just didnt work for me..However breakfast is tasty..pancakes were soo good. And my Gardener scramble was delicious! Love the smoky taste of the tofu strips. I will return  get my go to DanDan noodle bowl. The tofu , noodles and zucchini noodles worked well together  and just the right amount of spice. Topping it off w peanuts was perfect! The place is clean with a patio  and a really cozy corner area with couch and toys for the kiddos. I have to mention the desserts , Fantastic! Gluten free and raw offerings make it guilt free :)",

    "text": "If \"5 Stars\" is \"as good as it gets\" then 24 Carrots is well deserving of that rating. Because this place in its new location at Guadalupe Rd and McClintock Dr (just west of Baskin Robbins) is nothing short of phenomenal! The new venue boasts of a much larger dining area; is brightly lit (thanks to the entire north wall consisting of windows); has Vegan, Raw, and Gluten-free bakery items; as well as a cutting-edge Veg and Raw menu that consists of innumerable items that will absolutely-positively knock your socks off with flavor!    One thing that stands out at 24 Carrots, in comparison to other Veg restaurants of this type, is the freshness of the ingredients. Picture produce from local farms. And imagine that same produce being handpicked by the 24 Carrots' owner that very day. Then think taste explosion with each and every bite! As this isn't just a once-in-a-while sort of thing, 24 Carrots changes their menu weekly to reflect what's available from their dedicated local suppliers.  But the food at 24 Carrots is much more than just morsels as fresh as the morning dew. That's because 24 Carrots' redwoods-among-spruce reputation can be found in the sheer uniqueness and creativity of the menu items themselves. For this is no ordinary Veg food consisting of fake-meat sandwiches on vanilla-white bread or bland, grossly-overpriced rice bowls. Instead, you're getting is a bumper crop of culinary originality, food created by climbing mountains that other venues of this type have not yet dared to scale. And just when you think it can't get any better, 24 Carrots routinely tops themselves with some new flavor sensation that will curl your toes and shake, rattle, and roll your taste buds with utter delight!  Also, the new location has a much bigger staff, yet equally as friendly (thanks to greatly-expanded kitchen space having abundant room for more help), and that means they can now crank out their culinary masterpieces in short order.  And there's even comfy couches and chairs to sit on for people waiting for their lickety-split orders. Though, if time is not an issue, feel free to just hang out and sample one of their hit-the-spot juices or smoothies while you surf the web (and, of course, the Yelp website) on 24 Carrots' free Wi-Fi.     Overall, my two thumbs are up, waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy up(!) for the new 24 Carrots, which is setting the bar awfully high for outstanding Veg and Raw food in the southeast Valley of the Sun. Bravo!",

    "text": "Oh boy. I hate doing this. I really wanted this to be a great experience! Hardly. We went here at 11am on Sunday. What would normally be a busy time for a place like this. Only 4 or 5 tables sitting (the point was it was not busy). The gal who took our order was pleasant. No issue there. The food came out promptly and was hot. Again, no issue. Now for the hard part. This place was filthy. Loaded with dirty tables. A filthy floor. And the bathroom had no paper towels and the sanitary seat cover bin was empty. The windows (on the inside) were so dirty you could not see out of them. Some folks came in after us and they had to wipe off their own table (and the staff did not flinch). This always makes me wonder what the back of this place looks like and how they handle the food. There were lots of bodies able to do this work. Apparently not a priority. Gross. Now for the food. I had the French toast. Looked nice. But it was under cooked and overly sweet. Yuck. My wife had the enchilada thingy. It was ok (better than my dish). And the desert bar I ordered tasted like butter and sugar. Not much else. Better options in this space. Uprooted Kitchen or Pomegranate both upstage 24 Carrots by a long shot. Don't think I will be back.....sorry.",

It was just watermelon topped with \"jalapeno nectar\" (I think agave syrup or honey or something), pistachios, and basil.  Although for $6, I might just try to recreate it at home.  The jalapeno poppers were not my favorite.  I know that vegan cheese can't taste like real cheese, but the texture on this \"cheese\" was too watery for me.  The nachos were pretty good.  I liked that the portion was HUGE (definitely share these) and that they put some inventive stuff on top - like shredded beets!  The flavor was a little lacking for me, especially in the beans.  I think it needed some salsa or hot sauce to spice it up.  We also both ordered juices.  I got the \"beet it\" juice and thought it was good and refreshing.  Not too bitter even though there was no added sugar.  Overall, love the decor and ambiance of this place.  The food is unusual and an adventure to try new things, so I'd definitely be back!",

We also like to cook so the best meals are typically home made.    I wanted to hate this place since it's not close to home, but every single thing was lights out delicious.  We had this carrot ginger soup, raw tacos, nori wraps and Dan Dan noodles.    Everything looked and tasted Amazeballs!  It was a bit pricey but I'm happy to pay more for high quality, fresh and flavorful. We felt full and nourished and will try something sweet to go.   Lastly I read some other reviews that seemed very off put by the stoic demeanor of the cashier. I can see how polarizing his attitude might come off.  He wasn't what I'd call convivial.  I go to eat for the company I'm with, not the staff, so this was a non-issue for us. That said, a nice woman did come by and warmly asked if we enjoyed everything.    This place is 24 Carrot Gold!",

    "text": "I'm traveling and stayed a few days in Tempe. Once I discovered 24 Carrots I went back several times. The first time I got the El Vampiro juice - it was pretty much perfect! A little sweet and tangy with the shocking red of beets. Then I tried the quesadilla which was ok, liked the filling of black beans and kale but I've never been a fan rice wraps - too dry. And I think the guy at the counter was standing in for someone because he got my order wrong in two ways and it took a while. I went back for the wifi the next day and had the tres leches cupcake - this thing is divine!! Perfect texture and taste, not sickeningly sweet but decadent in all the right ways! I ordered the dandan noodles and that was amazing: crunchy veggies fresh spinach, delicious sauce with a touch of heat - I didn't need sriracha. Noodles get tough if you wait and eat it later so eat it fresh! The next day I got the mango cayenne cupcake - terribly hard cake and no spiciness but the mango cream/frosting was ok. I ate the black rice bowl for lunch and liked the flavors - had to add salt even though I usually don't eat a lot of salt - in this case it had zero salt and some added salt enhanced the flavors. I got the burger and carrot cake for dinner. The chickpea patty is nothing to write home about but the bread was very hearty and good. The side salad is yummy too and colorful, the balsamic vinaigrette is solid. The carrot cake was perfectly succulent but too much cream cheese frosting - wayyy too much! Could have gone without any of that. I give this place five stars because of so many vegan options that are gluten free as well, including deserts! Love it! And wifi!!!! Service can be slow and about half the people are friendly, the rest seem unhappy.",

Overpriced, small portions, bland mediocre at best food, terrible service, long wait times during non-rush hours. The best thing they have going for them is the cafe is cute on the inside.  The service was absolutely horrible, we were in line (mind you not a very long one) for at least 20 mins. We waited at least another 20 mins for any of our drinks to come out, 3 smoothies and two plain coffees. Then my wrap arrived and it was another 15 mins before our friends' food came out (they ordered before me), a wrap and a basic sandwich.   I love wraps, rice and grilled veggies, but my wrap was not good, the best part was the few bites with avocado in it (paid an extra $1 for maybe 1/4 or 1/2 of an avocado in it). The chips with salsa was decent, but came with a tiny amount of salsa.  Even the vegan in our group didn't really like her meal but was more okay with her boyfriend's sandwich. No one really liked their meal.   The smoothies were just ok. Mine (triple acai threat) had a good flavor but was super thin (more like juice). The dreamsicle flavor had a weird aftertaste and the peanut butter/chocolate had no chocolate flavor in it to be found.  All and all a real dud, we will never be back.",

There wasn't a lot of people though and the four of us only ordered juices/smoothies. How hard is that?! I also ordered one of their chocolate balls from their bakery.  They forgot it, so I had to go back up to the register to ask about it. The guy was apologetic and said he's bring it right over, which he did.  Everyone got their smoothies and juices but me. I remained patiently waiting until my friends finished their drinks. I realized they forgot me again. I went back to the register and notified the girl there that I never got my cucumber cooler. She apologized, they made it right then and there and gave it to me.  I was a little annoyed at all this.. So much that my review so far is solely based on customer service.  While waiting I did have a sip of the Good Juju and berry smoothie. They were both delicious. This is the reason I might come back, but if the service is the same I certainly won't.",

So far I've had a green smoothie and three brunch items - Arizona bowl, breakfast burrito, and carrot pancakes - and they are all so delicious! The carrot pancakes are especially delectable. They are so flavorful it's unreal, they almost taste like a cinnamon bun. It is a little pricier than I would typically like to pay (though not outrageous by any means) but it is worth the price; everything I've gotten has great flavor and is a pretty good portion, not to mention the ingredients they use are all local and natural/unprocessed. The place is adorable and pretty quiet and I enjoy going there by myself sometimes just to read.  The only cons I have are the price (but again, what I've had has been worth what I've paid) and every time I go I have to wait about 15 minutes for my food, no matter what I order or whether there are other customers in there or not.   Overall, great place! I have come back a few times and I will continue to!",

The reason I am here writing this review right now is because multiple times I've gone to 24 Carrots, the service has been absolutely terrible! Today when I went there was the straw that broke the camel's back! We ordered two sets of pancakes, but when we got them, they appeared a bit burnt. It wasn't until we flipped them over that we saw how really burnt they were! How can you even serve pancakes that burnt to your customers?! It was obvious that the cook had to have known he had burnt them too! He just tried to hide it! Then when we asked if they could remake them, the servers were very apologetic and understanding, but as we watched the servers tell the cook about the mistake, he raised his hands in the air above his head in annoyance! Why should HE be mad that HE made a mistake and now has to fix it?! We ended up getting new pancakes that were better and weren't burnt. I love 24 Carrots so much, and it pains me to write a bad review, but after several instances of bad service, it gets old, and something needs to change! I didn't pay $20+ for burnt pancakes! I hope things change for the better because I don't want to experience this anymore.",

    "text": "I came from Oklahoma to visit my dance teacher who lives in Phoenix and she took me to this wonderful vegan restaurant. She knows the owner Sadhana and her family.   The owner is super creative and their menu is always changing so on their website they have a \"weekly menu\". Many of the ingredients that they use are what vegetables are in season and are in plenty at the time. Since it is Fall, there is a plethora of pumpkin dishes!  My dance teacher and I each chose a dish and a juice:   Food:  *Roasted Quinoa Veggie Bowl* basil- roasted seasonal veggies, organic quinoa, lime tahini dressing, cranberry, sunflower seeds, and organic greens. This dish was SO delicious!! It came in a stainless steel bowl. The dressing was just enough, and the roasted veggies were warm, and so appetizing.  *Zucchini Noodle Salad* This bowl was huge! Two people could eat it. It was so yummy but I could not finish the whole thing. Made with zoodles (zucchini noodles), field greens (I had spinach), seasonal veggies (I had beets and carrots with my zoodles), seed medley (pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds), lemon tahini dressing. So healthy, crispy, and refreshing!  Juice:  *Carrots over Easy* this juice was sweet, but not too sweet. made with carrot, pineapple, strawberry, and apple. Absolutely delicious.  *Beet It* made with carrot, beet, ginger, cucumber, celery, and apple. You can really taste the ginger in this vibrant red juice. Super great for digestion and not bad tasting either.  I highly recommend this cafe to eat something healthy and hearty. There are a variety of foods from wraps, sandwiches, burgers, quesadillas, taquitos, and SO MUCH MORE! Sadhana and the chefs also prepare delicious baked vegan goods. I spied some pumpkin cookies and some kind of a cream cake in the dessert window! Your stomach will not be disappointed by this gem of a place. Go. NOW.",

    "text": "There's not a lot of places like this (vegan, gluten-free friendly, health conscious, organic) in Phoenix, although they are getting better! However, it's still no California when it comes to accommodating to the varying health preferences.   Honesty if you're in Phoenix and you've got dietary preferences or restrictions (gf, vegan), you're better off going to a Chipotle. Don't come here! Disappointed in the portion size, the wait and overall experience here. The atmosphere is deceivingly \"come one, come all\" but there's a weird aloof nature in the staff. A simple hummus plate I ordered took twenty minutes while the patrons who ordered after me got their food delivered before me. The wait was not worth it. The chips that came with it came to a grand total of maybe five? The hummus was weird, tasteless mush. Seriously, go to chipotle, order a burrito bowl with rice, or get some corn tortillas instead of flour, get beans and veggies instead at a generous portion size, and enjoy the pleasant, quick, efficient nature of the staff. Don't come here unless you want to overpay for poor service, and food that isn't worth the bill.",

Sasha is the owner and she puts so much love and creativity into her meals using the freshest organic ingredients from local farms. They have weekly specials and the menu is always changing.  The flavor profile of her food is so great with such depth. The desserts are to die for and the coffee is great too. My favorite entrees are the carnival butternut squash enchiladas, breakfast burritos and raw pasta marinara, but really you can't go wrong with anything you order. Their carrot cake is my favorite dessert.  The location is great too. It's in the same strip mall as Changing Hands book store and Trader Joe's.",

It's crazy their smoothies are no sugar added but they taste like milkshakes! So delicious and good for you. The staff is super nice and helpful when you ask about menu items.

I was even being helped by a regular customer that drives 30 miles just to come here! She convinced me that I NEEDED to try their dessert & k caved! I wish that I took a picture of it, but it was a cute mango, coconut & cashew cream parfait that was seriously the best thing I've ever tasted! It was the perfect amount of sweet! & the best part? No sugar added!   Back to my meal, I ended up choosing their Buddha Bowl. It was EXACTLY what I was wanting. Perfect amount of spice & the curry flavor was just what I was craving. It's also a generous helping. I easily saved the rest for tomorrow's lunch.   Bottom line, this place is definitely worth a try & I'm so happy I stopped in. This will not be the last",

The third time, today, I went back & I didn't like my smoothie, it was overly fruity, and I didn't like my raw cheesecake, it definitely was not up to my standards, but that's maybe b/c I make my own raw cheesecake & can be a little big of a harsher critic. The wait time was not bad, even though they were full. I still want to keep my 5 stars for this place because, again, they are vegan, support local, and use organic whenever possible.  Disclaimer: I do want to say that I could have modified the smoothie b/c I saw the ingredients prior to ordering, but I didn't. It being \"too fruity\" was definitely not on 24 Carrots :-)",

    "text": "It doesn't get much more vegan-hippie than this, but I dig it. I understand this is typically the demographic that healthy/vegan food cultivates. Initially I did not have much interest in checking this place out because of its overly-hippiness, but I went as per recommendation of my brother and do not regret it! My husband and I both had the vegan breakfast burrito and I got mine with a side of chips&salsa, and he got his with a side of fruit. Be prepared, although the burrito is a good portion size, the 'sides' are miniature. I believe his came with 5 pieces of fruit, and mine was 5 chips with a dollop of salsa. But, I would recommend going with the chips&salsa so you can use the salsa on the burrito. It took a while for our food to come out, but we did go at a peak hour. Also, their juice maker is in the front of the store and is extremely loud...so it was a little annoying to be trying to have a conversation only to be interrupted every 4 minutes by a jet engine. Regardless, I am still giving them 4 stars because I know I'll be back to try their nachos (we saw the table next to us give them and they look huge and delish!) and I like what they stand for. I'll always be an advocate for places that promote healthy and ethical eats!",

    "text": "I've been coming to 24 Carrots (old and new location) for over a year.  The food is consistently fantastic!   Always fresh and seasoned amazingly!  You might expect vegan food to be bland, but it's not when done right.  It is amazing the flavors they get out of things.  The creams you eat would make you swear they are cream from a cow..  Today I had their tacos with a side salad and carrot soup.  The shells and contents were very, very good.  (see my picture I posted).   I ALWAYS order the carrot soup when I'm here too.  This is my favorite item on the menu.  You also can never go wrong with the quesadillas.  They've been good with every variety they have offered.  Ok, the parts people might complain about:    1. The wait.  Yes, it takes a fairly long time to make fresh vegan food.  Usually I get my food within 10 mins though.  Once during a very busy time it did take 30 mins.  That is pushing people's patience for sure, but this isn't McDonalds.  If you don't want to wait, you can order ahead and pick it up when you arrive.  This works great for quick lunches.  2. The prices.  Yes, it's not cheap.  Again, fresh, organic food is expensive and takes a lot of labor to prepare.  I think the prices are reasonable for what you get.  3. The hip kids working there.  There are some kids working there that have kind of a hippy vibe or tattoo obsessions or are pierce-aholics.  This kind of goes with the territory though of these types of places.  As long as they are clean and handle my food properly, I'm fine with it!  If you judge people on looks, you might be taken aback though.  Overall, great place that i love to eat at.",

I had the southwest wrap and my cousin had the Arizona bowl both were pretty bland and needed more seasoning. We did try their juices and smoothies though which were super good! I'm used to vegan restaurants in Portland which are both abundant and delicious, but I would definitely give 24 carrots another try.",

    "text": "Veganism (let alone raw vegan) isn't nearly as trendy as it used to be, so options in the Valley are consequently dwindling. I'm thrilled 24 Carrots is carrying the torch! Nothing in Whole Foods (where I usually go for such dishes) compares to what I could eat here--for example, the raw vegan cheesecake is fresh, creamy, and packed with flavor; the ones at Whole Foods are waxier, likely because they aren't as fresh. I also loved the pineapple express: totally fresh, which far exceeds cold pressed, bottled fare sold for the same price in health food stores.   The food is absolutely fantastic, and the portions are massive. The prices are a bit high, but well-justified given the freshness, quality of ingredients and portion size. I can't complain about the price.   I had the Arizona bowl and it was big enough to serve as two separate meals. It was lovely, filling and nourishing food. I also had the raw vegan carrot soup. It had a good bite and nice flavor profile, though it could have been creamier and richer. This could be achieved by nuts, but even just by blending a Vitamix for a bit longer.  The only complaint was that it took a little while to get my food. The deliciousness and freshness was worth it but such time can be hard to bear with a baby in tow. Props to the kids corner stacked with books and toys though. Very cool and rare to find in restaurants.   Excellent food all around. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",

The good juju was ok, I'm not a huge fan of the cinnamon, but the almond and coconut combo was nice. However the Arizona bowl was *phenomenal*. It's a little bowl but packed with fresh veggies and flavor. At first I thought the bowl was too small but then I couldn't even finish it! It's a rich, dense, and saucy bowl of cooked veggies. The service that day was pretty mediocre. Every one was exceptionally nice and kind but they messed up different aspects our order three times (!!!). If they weren't so darn sweet and charming I might have minded but I enjoyed the staff's company and didn't mind sticking around a little longer chatting with them. Plus I got a delicious and nutritious meal at the end.  I really hope they open up one of these in downtown Phoenix! Green is so unhealthy, and Bragg's needs a friend who makes smoothies and juices! I'll definitely be back.",

It's a super chill place, with plenty of comfortable low-key seating, and a menu chock full of juices, smoothies, salads and deliciousness.  There's a refrigerated unit with some fresh veggies for sale.  There's also a display case with gluten free and soy free desserts.  As you order some food, you'll probably want to order more, because the menus are delicious.  If you like juice, then you're set.  If you like smoothies, you're set.  If you like vegan desserts, you're set.  Their entrees include wraps, tacos (!), sandwiches, salads and raw delights.  So delicious.  I was impressed with the number of raw food choices they had.  I'm bummed that I didn't get to have the breakfast - gluten free carrot pancakes and french toast.  A dream come True for those who eschew gluten!  The entrees here are delicious.  Just watching what people were eating was so exciting.  My favorite raw sushi nori rolls ever were here - I was impressed by the delicious selection of ingredients tossed together into these tasty treats.  I would order them every time I went there, hands down.  So delicious and fresh and flavorful and not overly salty (usual downfall of raw vegan sushi rolls).  The veggies are so fresh, I was so happy.  The zucchini noodles were also so fresh and deliciously sliced to a thinness that gave zucchini noodles a new definition.  Delightful.  So exciting for my tastebuds, because I love zucchini noodles, but I never realized how they could be done so perfectly.  Give me more!  All in all, this place is a veg paradise, and if it were open Sunday night, I would've gone back in a heartbeat.  Fresh, tasty and healthy - what more does one want in an eatery?",

    "text": "I am not vegan and this place is legit! I have driven past numerous times before venturing into this \"health\" spot. One day, after being sick for a few weeks, I thought I'd be adventurous and stop in for a fresh juice that might help fight the cold. Man was I in for a treat and it has since become a favorite spot of mine!  Still a skeptic, I thought to myself, \"I better try this place a few times before writing a review.\" Now that I've been several times, I feel like I can truly vouch for this place. I can't believe their meatless dishes are so delicious and flavorful! So far, I have tried the following:  -Hangry Tacos - Really good! Not the largest portion but still a good size. I was full after eating this dish. They looked dry and unappealing but don't let that discourage you from biting in and experiencing all the flavor! -Raw Tree of Life Salad -- Huge!! Enough to split. So many interesting flavors. I prefer it with their vinaigrette over the tahini dressing. -Portobello Cheese Steak Sandwich -- I was truly a skeptic of this dish and almost didn't try it. I am SO glad I did. It is by far my favorite dish and I can't wait to order it again.  Most of the juices I tried were primarily selected to help me get over a cold and were full of ginger, beets, carrots, and a few other Vitamin C packed fruits/veggies. If you want a sweet, yummy juice, the Blue Pom Bomb is really tasty. They can give you great recommendations on juices depending on exactly what you're looking for...  Which brings me to their service. I am so impressed. All the staff I encountered were super friendly and willing to answer any of my questions. They provided excellent recommendations and because of this, I have tried great dishes I wouldn't have selected on my own.   I also like the layout of this place and it's always clean. They even have a cute, little, comfy corner nook with seating if you want to chill, read, or just hangout. It's also nice they offer both indoor and outdoor patio seating.   Even if you're not a health nut, one day when you're feeling adventurous, give this place a shot!",

    "text": "I really want to like this place but this was my second try and it just does not impress me. The staff is very friendly but in need of customer service training. Food execution needs work too. My first visit was disappointing for a few reasons, one was because they were out of the special, something that again happened today. The portion sizes are on the small size for the prices they charge. The mac & cheese is so small but they trick you into thinking there is a lot. The bottom of the bowl has a huge handful of raw spinach to take up space, very deceiving. The actual amount of mac & cheese is no more than 1 1/2 cups. This is not a main dish! The jalapeno popper appetizer is not accurate! There are no jalapenos, they are not battered nor fried. It is raw red pepper with almond spread...totally False advertising. The server immediately recognized the disappointment and said they are trying to get the owners to change the name. Well, yes, if customers are continuously disappointed then something should be done. The enchiladas were tasty but very dry. Food should not be dry at 1230pm! The caramel bar was good but very, very sweet and under cooked like eating raw cookie dough. Then we noticed we were overcharged for a drink. It was just $1.00 but when we brought it to their attention they tried to give us a $2 off coupon instead of just refunding the $1. The claimed the chalk board was wrong...but that does not change the facts. Frankly after spending over $50 for lunch for two people, the dollar is meaningless. But it does speak to the lack of training. We certainly are not going to rush back to use a coupon and spend even more money. We eventually had the dollar refunded but they did not do that right either as tax should have added to the refund as well. Oh well, we tried, twice. Not happening again.  Additionally, I am now I am having an allergic reaction to the wildflower tea. I specifically asked twice if it had lavender and both times was told no. LIARS!!!  You could kill someone with your incompetence!",

Their website said that their menu is updated weekly. To this, the 24 carrot staff were rude and I got angry looks from the staff. When my food arrived, there was hardly any avocado in my burrito. I realized this after eating one half, and emptied the other half to verify my hunch. I've attached a picture of my half portion: an thin avocado piece no longer than an inch. They made me look like a fool for complaining for a $1, and paid me back in rude lunch experience.   Moral of the story: don't complain for avocados here. I'm very unhappy with their customer service. I left my number for the manager to reach back to me, no calls yet.  New update: got a cauliflower wrap which was good, but offered stale smelling hummus as a side. On complaining Manager argued it's not stale and served it to 20 people. I'm scared to fall sick after consuming a bit of this stale food. I was offered a substitute, but manager didn't want to admit their mistakes, this is after paying 13$ for this meal.   I would advice not to have food here, their quality has come down but prices are still freaking high.",

When we got their it was a coffee shop, which was okay but the prices were so high. I was overwhelmed by all the options and even curious about some of the healthy options and brunch options as well. I asked the cashier what the most popular item is and she just started reading off the menu to me, so than I asked her what her favorite item is and she said that she didn't know. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak with the bean curd and it was honestly okay, kind of bland. Definitely not worth 12$. My sister got a sweet potato Cuban sub and it was so flavorless, also not worth 12$. We split these honey mustard pretzels and they were greasy on the outside and dry on the inside. This is the price I would pay if I out to a nicer restaurant for dinner. We tried to save the meal with their nutter butter cookie sandwich, but it was just crumbly and fell apart and the cream on the inside was a clay texture. Overall we will not be returning due to the prices, taste of food, atmosphere, and lack of good customer service.",

I went with a friend once and she wasn't too happy with the service because the employee wanted her to go back up to the counter to finalize payment when a second helping of a dish was ordered.  They do spin the iPad around and have a tip option immediately which makes sense since they bring the items to your table with a number and clean the table for you.  I always tip but still clear my own table so it's a little confusing because there isn't an area to put your plates when you are done or a visible trash can.  Signage may help it be more clear how they serve and clear the tables.",

I don't think it's just me who would eat there more often if it was less spendy.",

Value is important to all, including vegetarians, and it's crucial to be considerate of that when creating a menu.",

    "text": "This used to be a 5 star from me as the food is usually very good and completely vegan with gluten free options that are cooked to order, not the typical gluten free default breads and tortillas that other places use.    The reason for this review though, is that the place has really been off their game lately.  This is so sad because I want to love them and I keep giving chances almost weekly! All summer I have been going there, but more than 75% of the time they are closed during hours that their website and yelp state should be opened.  This is beyond frustrating as they are across town for me and also I have tried to bring a few different friends from out of town only to get there and have to find another place.    usually when I get to eat there, the food is phenomenal; however, I have noticed portions getting smaller and smaller and when the owner is not there they always \"run out\" of gluten free bread (which is made to order so read: don't feel like mainf it).  Finally, I went yet again today to order my favorite thing, the \"BLT gluten free\", which I have ordered for four years now, and it was literally about a quarter of the size that it used to be.  I could have eaten it in 3 bites and it was $12.50!! I never usually complain but I did ask if I could either get more or be charged for a half order, since that is what I got.  They were nice and gave me another micro mini sandwich but they both were completely undressed and very different from the usual deliciousness.  They were mediocre at best.  I'm really disappointed and after 4 months of really unfortunate disappointments, not sure I want to keep giving chances to this place... Ugh there goes one of the few vegan options I have... Really hope they get it together Bc I miss 24 carrots!",

We ordered the hummus to start which had about 1.5 tablespoons which wasn't even enough to dip all the vegetables we were given. Also it wasn't good. I had the BLT which was bland and had a weird taste. I also ordered the apple soyrizo hash which had no soyrizo in it and when I asked I was told it's just the flavor. Well then don't put that in the name of the item and also then where is the flavor coming from??   My brother had the avocado quinoa bowl and it was tasteless and missing items like black beans and my mom had the blueberry French toast... The toast was literally just toasted and there were barely any toppings, in fact she had to ask for more to make it edible. Also the free mom-mosa that was to come for my mom took 45 mins: ridiculous.   Apparently the smoothies are good so my recommendation is - make it a smoothie bar... Smoothies, coffees, dessert.. That'd be great.  But don't do food. I cook vegan food and it can be delicious. This was not that. And it was way overpriced for what it was.   Someone did come over to ask us how it was and when we told her she offered to refund us, which we declined, or give us a gift certificate which we did accept.. But that's always like cool your food was bleh gimme more! We may return to try something else but well see. Not in a rush.   We got Baskin Robbins after. Can't go wrong there.",

They only have a banner in the window and the door is hidden behind an alcove on the end of the shopping center so it makes it pretty hard to see driving by.  They are in the Trader joe's shopping center on the opposite end.  Hopefully they are getting a new sign so that people can find them.  I will have to say they are 100% better in the new location.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, there is plenty of room and the food service time has been really fast the four or five times I have been. They keep the web site updated with their menu since it rotates from week to week which is always nice to be able to check before heading over.  Keep up the good work.

Real fruits & veggies, real fruit juice and the way they make their smoothies thick is to add frozen fruit instead of ice. The secret.  Their menu changes weekly, so that can be a good thing, but alas it means you can't get the same thing twice. Their raw sushi one week may be outstanding, the next week just okay. I've also had their quesadilla, which has also varied in quality. Hopefully they will at some point settle on a few fixed entrees the way Green has. I don't want to stifle the cook's creativity, but I also want a meal I can depend on to be delicious.  Love the new space. Congrats on the upgrade!",

I'd recommend starting there. Salads are good. Burgers, honestly I'd pass on them. Desserts, smoothies and teas are all great! Husband especially likes the PB & B. I like how big the Iced tea selection is. Last visit I had the cookie bar with salted caramel icing. Yum but super rich! We've exhausted the kids menu, but unfortunately my toddler won't touch it. I think that's more about her than the food. I've tried her meals and they're okay. Customer service here is excellent! The space is a good size and they have a play area for kids, which as parents of a young child we love! I haven't been in for breakfast yet, but based on the pictures I need to make that happen.

I have been eating their fresh and ever-changing food creations as well as drinking their fresh juices and smoothies for several years, dating back to their original location in Chandler.    It is really nice to see them expand into this new location in Tempe, where they are growing and getting the exposure they deserve.  They offer healthy, delicious options for raw, vegan, and gluten free eaters.    Sasha, the owner, took time to sit with me and give me valuable tips and suggestions for choosing to go on a raw cleansing diet.  Very warm, knowledgable, and hospitable.  She even let me try a raw dessert on the house!    I give this restaurant five stars and would love to see it continue to grow and succeed.

Tons of smoothies and juices Good coffees and teas We've had 6 different menu items - and we've been happy with them all.  Cons: Lots of chalkboard menus with squished writing - bring your glasses! Extremely laid back atmosphere, we're cool with it, but strange for people who aren't.

There are also wraps, plates, bakery items and more.  Their juices are interesting combinations of fruit and veggies that are delicious and filling.   The owner, Sasha, came to our table to greet us and insure all was well. Very nice lady who is dedicated to healthy eating and quality organic ingredients.   Great place for vegetarians, vegans, raw foodists, gluten intolerants and many others with dietary restrictions or preferences, and it tastes good for \"regular\" folks too.   The only two downsides are probably unavoidable. Number one, it is rather noisy with the blenders going to make the juices and smoothies, and no soft surfaces on the floors or walls to absorb the sound. The other is the price. This is not a cheap place to go, but you get what you pay for and I believe the value is there.  Best to luck to 24 Carrots in its new location!",

They were just not for me.   My boyfriend had there green Chile tamale tacos and he hated it said it was bland, and overpriced.  My son had the cucumber humus, he also was not a fan.   I'm the only vegetarian on the household so I love finding places like this but if my men don't like I probably won't go back.   It is very over priced tho, for three people (and one was off the kids menu) I paid $60 and it literally a walk up stand nothing fancy.",

It took forever to get our food and $4 for a 16oz cup filled with huge ice cubes all the way to the top. Ice tea was NOT freshly made (which I expect when paying that kind of a price with no refills... big no - no, poured from a pre-made container (it tasted old!)... When I complained about the 4oz tea with 12oz of ICE, I was told sorry, no refills unless I want to pay ANOTHER $4!!! No thanks. Even though the food was good (although no where stated where any of the organic food was sourced)... when a restaurant is in desperate need to rip off customers without a care... that's where I draw the line.

What I found very objectionable, was sanitation. One of the servers had long dreadlocks, but no hair covering at all. This is unacceptable in any place that serves food. Worse still, companions food had 2 hairs in it.  Rather than complain and take a chance on eating food that is contaminated, we both left immediately and found a different place to eat.

    "text": "Well, I see this place bought a ton of Yelp advertising, which included the decent of the Yelp minions, again, coincidentally ALL thought this juice shop in a Tempe, Arizona, strip mall, is a 5 Star place.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against 24 Carrots Juice Bar & Cafe, but 5 Stars? Just look at the photos.  To me, this place is 3/5 Stars, but I love their big helpings of fresh veggies, their local do-good story, and their HUGE DETERMINATION to succeed.   I love the \"Do whatever it takes\" can-do attitude.  24 CARROTS JUICE BAR & CAFE: THEIR STORY  7 years ago, Sasha got thirsty. Really REALLY thirsty. And so, she began on a quest to quench that thirst. But everywhere she looked she was faced with the same problem. Drinks, juices and smoothies filled with artificial ingredients and excessive sugar.  Realizing the serious need for a healthy and tasty snacking alternative, she came up with '24 Carrots.' In 2007, she was joined by her best friend and cousin, Shyam, who brought with him a wealth of business intuition and a very discerning palate.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   I was first introduced to this place because of my trainer.  My trainer is IN LOVE WITH JUICING and LOVES this place.  When we went in, I was nonplussed. It just doesn't seem like a place where I'd usually hangout. That's just my personal bias though. The fresh treats refrigeration display only had a 1/2 of a carrot cake and was storing some ingredients that weren't for sale.  The menu is on a chalk board. I ordered the Voodoo Child juice.  It took about 10 minutes to receive two juices and a piece of carrot cake to-go. We subsequently tasted the carrot cake and it didn't taste that good to me.  My juice was served room temperature/warm. Maybe I'm too picky, maybe I don't like my juice warm, but it made it difficult to drink. In the juice's favor, it was JUICE juice, not a smoothie, meaning it's made with REAL food, not with sherbet or excess sugar fillers.  CONCLUSION   I've been several times, mostly because it's close to my home, I love their commitment to healthy food, and I do love supporting deserving local business.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F24cartotsjuice.com&s=bb1d26d039a678391ddbea4060b459679459177741767415e7b26fd523be82d2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">24cartotsjuice.com</a>",

The food was good but for the price you do not get much for example my husbands plate looked like a kids portion. I am not sure that it will be put in our regular vegan rotation but I would return again if I am in the area for nothing else but to try one of the juices.",

    "text": "A few years ago, I did a project where I made a database of vegetarian and vegan spots around the greater Phoenix area. This was on the list and I've had it bookmarked since. I was across the street from it and made it over to order an early dinner.   It wasn't busy when I arrived and I took a look at their menu on Facebook before I came. I was confused that the regular menu didn't show up on my phone (I think it's the file type) but looking at the website, it's there. I ordered their garden burger, which was made with a black bean burger, tomatoes, greens, a blackberry chipotle sauce, and topped with a \"jalapeno popper\". It comes with a choice of side and I did a salad. I also ordered a campfire brownie, which looked really good in the case.   This place definitely has a hipster vibe to it and there is a lot of seating. The cashier who rung me up wasn't friendly, nor was he rude. I got my food within 10 minutes and it was just handed to me. The worker at the coffee spot was chatting with a customer for a while. Sometimes, you get a feeling about a place or about people and I was not impressed. When I got home and began eating my food the only thing I enjoyed was the brownie, which was pretty delicious and authentic for being vegan. The salad was literally just greens, so nothing special. The vinaigrette was pretty good though. The burger was not very good. The bun was soft, and I would've liked it to be toasted, and the patty itself was soft and not flavorful. The lettuce was almost too crunchy. I know I seem picky but I personally didn't enjoy the food. Pair that with the lack of customer service and I won't be coming back.",

I thought to myself it's okay just drink water because I don't wanna bother them... But after three bites I can't stand it... :( I'm sorry I really want to like this dish, but it's just too much for me. It was nice tho they made me another one with soy sauce on the side so I can add it myself. It's much better.... I would recommend you get soy sauce on the side and add it to your taste. Other than that things are good. And I may try some other things here again. So 3 stars.",

As a new vegan, I'm still learning about all the great types of food there are, and 24 Carrots is a great place to try new things. I took some friends for breakfast and we got the breakfast burrito, Arizona Bowl with cauliflower, and the french toast. Everything was flavorful, fresh, balanced, and DELICIOUS!  I am a total caffeine addict, so I also got a soy latte with date caramel- Holy deliciousness! Really rich and decadent. They also do fresh juices and smoothies.  The cashier was really helpful and knowledgeable when I asked him about some of the dishes and their ingredients, and the staff checked in often to make sure we were enjoying our meal.  The limoncello cookie sandwich was amazing as well, we all split it for dessert. A great, casual place to bring friends and have an amazing healthy meal. We will definitely be back!!",

As a vegan from San Diego, I seek out local veg*n restaurants like I did this weekend in Phx. 24 Carrots is very close to where I stayed and I was excited to try the cauliflower breakfast burrito.  The gal taking our order was completely insouciant, barely verbal, and quite rude. I decided against ordering a meal and instead settled on an almond milk latte and spicy chocolate cupcake.  After waiting 10 minutes and noticing no one working on the latte, I asked the gal about it. Apparently she had buried the order with all of the others so we had to wait even longer. No acknowledgement or apology.  The cupcake was dry and not much better than Whole Foods's vegan pastries.  A $4 cupcake should be moist and tasty.   What is really unfortunate is that I brought my mom, an omnivore who is curious to try vegan cuisine. She was so turned off by the negative experience that she will not be back. And she lives around the corner.  Take a cue from Nami, people. Improve your customer service and desserts.",

That being said, the three star rating is on here with my willingness to return and hopefully update my review and increase stars. My experience on the customer service side was overall pretty poor. I arrived, and was a little taken aback by all the options and I had limited time so I went with soup and a hummus/veggie plate. They had two soups listed on the chalkboard but they were out of one. Which is fine.... But its a chalkboard, so just erase the unavailable soup. I even suggested it, but was either ignored or maybe she didn't hear me.  I get my soup and its the one they originally told me they were out of. Luckily I was hungry and they both sounded delicious so I went with it. It was a ginger coconut carrot something or other. Very good!!!! It was sweet and I'm thinking with coconut milk and extra agave added and some apple juice (as she explained was part of the soup base) - might be vegan but probably high calorie and definitely high sugar. Very gingery but also very good. Was just puzzled at the mix up that they never quite admitted to.  Anyway..onto my hummus/veggie platter. I was one of two patrons there. My hummus platter (hummus and veggies) took about fifteen minutes. It was bewildering. I was so hungry and didn't want to continue eating the high sugar soup so I just waited and waited and listened to the several staff folks just banter with each other. I was very frustrated. Even if the hummus is prepared fresh per order..it still took about ten minutes longer than it should have.  It was good, full of great veggies and portion of hummus was generous which made me happy.   It was the inexplicable long wait and weird inaccurate communication about the soup that drops this review from four to three stars. However I am excited to come back and hopefully be proven that this was a one-off. Luckily the food seems great so I'm optimistic that customer service concerns are resolved.",

The juice is as fresh as fresh can be. Prices are reasonable for a vegan joint, which sometimes can be more than I would wish to pay. The patio area is absolutely adorable. I want to recreate it at my house. There are fresh herbs outside that don't disappoint. You can smell the basil as walk past into the front door. Local ingredients are used whenever possible which gains major bonus with my husband and I. Another thing I really loved, there were people of all ages here. It's not just any \"hipster\" place. A lot of vegan places get a reputation as \"hipster.\" 24 Carrots did not disappoint!",

A hidden hole in the wall of flavor and serenity this will quickly become my go to place! 24 Carrots is filled with vegan options for breakfast or lunch, gluten free goodies, coffee, tea, fabulous concoctions of fruit & vegtable juice and smoothies, friendly service, books and even a cozy corner to curl up and read in.

I enjoyed the Blue Pom Bomb a sweet mixture of blueberry, pomegranate, strawberry and apple juice and the potato leek soup,that came with a kick of spice, loved it!

The food is ok not bad and not great just ok so nothing to go out if your way for its also very expensive for what you get. I got the vegetable scramble from the breakfast menu and was disappointed in how oily everything was, barely any vegetables and ofcourse my order was messed up. The reason I am giving it such low ratings is when I asked twice when ordering whether a dish was GF and was told yes several times. When the dish came it had toast which was a main component and I again asked and ofcourse it wasn't. They then told me they could switch it for GF bread but I would have to pay for it even though it was their mistake! Good thing the nice guy at the register probably realized how ridiculous this was when I tried to go pay for it and told me to not worry about it. Sad to say I won't be going back as it just doesn't deliver in any aspects.",

Incredibly delicious vegan desserts. As someone who tries to follow a natural, plant-based diet, this place is a dream!  The only negative thing I would say is sometimes service isn't great, and they'll let you stand at the counter for a while without acknowledgement. But some of the people there are sweet. Their juices and smoothies look great, but I make that stuff at home so I haven't tried them. And when I took my sister here, she stated that it was \"too healthy\" for her.

I ordered the Arizona bowl, the Kapi coffee, and a raw pumpkin cheesecake. The BF ordered the French toast and the Gardener Scramble- delicious as well. Loved it all. I felt so good about what I was eating and it came out surprisingly fast. The Kapi was so yummy. I'll be back here regularly.",

    "text": "Not just carrots.  But, all about healthy drink and food selections.  Even their coffee and teas are healthy organic.  I don't eat here as there is a restaurant across the street which has my current food attention.   My staple here is the Triple Threat, primarily because of the amazing health benefits of pomegranate juice.   Additionally across the street is a tan bed shop where my then girlfriend frequented nearly daily.  So, she would tan, and I would fest. Then we would met up at the frozen yogurt shop (her choice).  Then it would be hold on for dear life when she drove us off FAST in her sports car.  I paid the price for my younger years when I enjoyed speed. But, I was also at the wheel in those days.  Oh, back to the health shop/restaurant...great place. Expensive too. But, that's to be expected.  NOTE: read my other numerous reviews for tips, entertainment, and historic references. Thank you, Tim B.",

    "text": "8/20/19  I am one picky eater. I'm a chef myself and I'm very critical of food. This place was really really good! I had the Nashville hot chickun sandwich and a salad, my husband had the raw Alfredo zoodles. Both dishes were really good and full of flavor. For dessert we had a pumpkin pie snickerdoodle cookie sandwich and a campfire brownie. They were amazing!! I'm definitely going back to try some of their other dishes. I definitely recommend that you try it out.  8/25/19  Went back to try some more yummy food here, and it was disappointing. I had ordered the seasonal tacos and they were deep fried , but not correctly. They were soggy and super oily and lacking in flavor. I ordered an extra side of salsa and some ranch and the salsa needed salt and the ranch was watery and tasted like nothing and I had no issue paying for it but it was definitely not good. The rice and beans with the dish also were flavorless and sad. The desserts are decent and can be dialed in a bit and their juice was good even though they forgot we ordered it and brought it out at the end of our meal.  The complete flavor profile was lacking last night and I unfortunately have to change my 5 star review down to a 3 star review. Food and flavor need to be consistent regardless of your staff and time of day.",

    "text": "I was really feeling up for something healthy and fresh, and we decided to venture over to Tempe to try 24 Carrots out. This place exudes good intentions, and I really appreciate that. The staff cares about the food they are serving and the causes they are supporting. Unfortunately, it is a little on the higher price end, and the desserts miss the mark. I feel very conflicted because I want to give all the stars for the vibe and mission, but the food is more like a three star experience. Really, I am a 3.5 here.  I went with the daily taco dish, which were vegan carne asada, made with seitan and mushrooms. They were delicious, although they were on the small side (for the price tag). It was served with a rice and beans mixture that was made with some type of green sauce that was quite spicy for me. (It might have been a coriander chutney.) i was surprised to get the rice/beans because the cashier asked if I was ok with a salad for a side. There was no salad, unless rice and beans is their meaning of a \"salad?\" My husband got the daily quesadilla, which was styled as \"rice a roni beeph,\" and it was pretty tasty. He got chips and salsa with it, and that was a better side, in my opinion.  I really wanted a piece of chocolate cake for dessert, but they only were sold as whole cakes, unfortunately. I opted for a tiramisu cake, which didn't have much in the way of coffee flavor, and it tasted just like a basic chocolate cake with some cream topping. So, I guess I got my chocolate cake fix, but I would have been sorely disappointed if I was hankering for some tiramisu. I am not sure I would go back for dessert.  I WOULD go back for a juice, though. It was pricey - $9 for 20 oz, but it was delicious. I had a concoction of beets and ginger and other goodness, and it hit the spot. My husband did a green smoothie, and it was good, although not as great as my juice.   Despite the mixed review, I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "I read some of the previous reviews that were anything less than 4 stars, and the complaints were \"unsanitary\" or \"expensive\". What these people don't understand is the entire concept of this beautiful, sustainable, and wholesome Vegan cafe that I adore.   I started coming here when I moved to Tempe after about 2012. I left Tempe in 2015 and forgot about this gem of a restaurant.  Don't come here for quick and cheap eats. Come here for vegan and gluten friendly soul food cooked with high quality ingredients and friendly caring staff.  I stopped in today for a quiet place to study as I was in the area unexpectedly. I had time to discuss food with the owner who was at the register herself a lot of the time today. You can tell she's so passionate about what she does and the food her team creates. It radiates.  I ordered the raw carrot ginger soup and the cold brew. Both delish and refreshing on a hot June day in Arizona. I enjoyed the atmosphere so much I stayed studying for several hours. I love that they have sustainable refillable water available for guests and I also was able to get silverware on my own. A not so friendly previous Yelper said dirty silverware made them leave. They much have never worked in a restaurant- because it happens. More than we all want to know or admit, but my silverware today was clean.   I enjoyed myself studying I stayed for a few hours and never felt unwelcome. I watched the lunch rush get handled with ease by the staff. They seem like happy busy bees running around. I used the gender neutral bathrooms several times. They were clean and well stocked. Low flow toilets with cute signs made me happy; again, about sustainable living and eco friendly awareness.  I had a friend call so decided to invite here down for lunch because hours slipped by and I was hungry again. She got Thai style peanut noodles and tiramisu and enjoyed it. I got the bean vegan burger special with GF bun and side salad. We both ordered and LOVED the real, traditional Chai   The owner even bussed my plate that was almost licked clean and chatted with us a bit more. Again, it made me fall in love with this place even more.   I'll be back and gladly pay the fair cost of the menu for such worthy ingredients and high quality from-scratch vegan goodness.  Thank you 24 Carrots. You made studying for nursing school super enjoyable today. I'll be back.",

What I received exceeded my expectations and helped make the birthday celebration extra special.  The cake was beautifully decorated, delicious, and exactly as large as was stated (was told it served 8, it ended up cutting into perfect eighth sized slices).

She mentioned there was a place up the street and we decided to feast.   Bright, clean interior. Friendly staff and a whole lot of items to choose from. I was decided upon their tacos that are on the menu, however when I saw that one of the specials were jackfruit BBQ tacos I decided to go for it. I am very glad that I did. I'd never had jackfruit before and was excited to give it a try.   The tortillas were small like street tacos and they were really good. There was a perfect amount of sauce on them and the BBQ wasn't overpowering, in fact I'd almost forgotten that they were BBQ apart from a sweet hint that came through ever few bites. The beans and rice were really good as well.   I also grabbed a Blue Pom Bomb juice, mmmmm. I appreciated that they had their juices separated by fruit and veggie options because I know there are times I shy away from the fruit juices.   The vibe was light, the food was great. I am so glad there are more and more places like this making plant based diets easier to follow while dining out.",

    "text": "One of my friends introduced me to this vegan restaurant and I couldn't have been happier. First, I rarely go to vegan restaurants because I love my meats way to much, so I was willing to try something new. I was a little overwhelmed with the menu because everything sounded great. I ended up convincing myself to order an appetizer, a sandwich, dessert, and a drink.  My appetizer was the pepper poppers, which was five pieces of red pepper with spicy almond cheese, sesame seeds, and small pieces of dried fruit on top. I absolutely loved it because I'm a huge fan of spicy foods. The chef explained to us that they would have done jalapeno instead of red peppers, but they were apprehensive of the spice level.  I ordered the Nashville Chicken sandwich, which had faux chicken, pickles, tomatoes, and a house sauce that is on the spicier side. The chef was asking for my opinion on the level of crispiness of the chicken and it's definitely on the crispier side. However, that's how I like fried chicken. I understand that the level of crispiness can be subjective. I love the amount of house sauce they put on the sandwich. It was enough to taste and it didn't overpower the full taste of the sandwich.   My dessert was a tiramisu and it was absolutely delicious. The piece of cake was extremely moist and flavorful. My friend and I continue to rave about it.  The customer service was amazing and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxing. We went on a Thursday afternoon, so people were probably at work then.",

Cooked to perfection, ingredients blend together to give you mouth watering tastes. Served not too cold not too warm.  Cucumber Cool: obviously cucumber juices are my favorite things. Tasted good with parsley etc.  Why 4 stars?? I feel price is too much for the quantity. I could easily get ~2.5 meals outside for the price (not vegan obviously), but I'm also comparing it with other vegan restaurants.",

House made bun I think it was potato rosemary... very nice to see not store bought but made on site.  Everything is made fresh onsite.  Got a gluten free cookie bar for later. Friend had a green smoothie made fresh with no powders.  Lives up to its reputation of fresh vegan vegetarian mostly gluten free. The pricing is right on track with other restaurants using organic and fresh ingredients.  The staff used food handler gloves for gluten free   The only thing that was distracting was a very loose dress code.  I'm not up for booty shorts by restaurant personnel it's very unprofessional even in a casual restaurant.  I'm paying for atmosphere and food, so I don't know if I'll be back.",

    "text": "We had heard about 24 carrots and had wanted to try it for a short while. Heard lots of good things. So we hit our Saturday morning boot camp workout, went by the farmers market for a little bit, and worked up an appetite. Upon arriving we were greeted by a pretty little bed of flowers out front and as we walk in it became evident to me that this establishment supports local fresh Growers and makes it their mission to have a very welcoming atmosphere for anyone to enjoy and an abundant menu that can cater to just about anyone's taste buds. My mother loved the masala chai, and she has been making her own fresh masala Chai at home for about 40 years!!! I had a coffee and it was pretty decent. I ate the Arizona Bowl with cauliflower and was very pleasantly surprised by the way that the Apple soyrizo hash mixes with the garlic aioli and all the veggies and black beans. I eat meat two or three days every week and I enjoyed this meal so much more than most meat dishes! You can taste the quality in the all fresh ingredients!  I will certainly be back!",

    "text": "My co-workers and I decided to try this place for lunch.  I was slightly skeptical to begin with being the carnivore that I am, but I figured I'd branch out beyond my typical lunch spots.  The ambience was as I expected a vegetarian/vegan cafe would be with a spiritual/yogi vibe.  When we got there, a few people were seated and it was far from what I would consider busy.  We placed our orders and took a seat while we waited for our food...and waited...and waited.  My colleagues ordered smoothies and a salad and I got the portabello cheese steak sandwich with a cup of the spicy roasted tomato vegetable soup.  All items that you would think could be put together and be in customer's hands within 10 - 15 minutes tops.  From placing our order to having food in hand, this quick 'to-go' lunch stop ended up taking almost 40 minutes!   Although I thought my food was flavorful, my sandwich did not stay in sandwich form for long.  With every bite, more and more of the sandwich kept spilling out the sides.  At the same time, my soup was more of the consistency of chunky mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately for my co-workers, their salad left a lot to be desired and they resorted to tossing it out.  For the time our adventure took and the price (forgot to mention that you should probably be ready for some sticker shock), I probably won't give this place another attempt.",

The hardest part of a no dairy diet, in my opinion, is the fact that I can no longer enjoy conventional desserts. I was able to find a salted caramel bar of sorts, and a cream-filled chocolate cupcake. Both were absolutely delicious! I expected the salted caramel bar body to be moist, so I was unexpectedly surprised by the semi-cookie consistency, but this didn't detract from the deliciousness at all! The cupcake was like a Hostess cupcake, but way better! I also order a brown suga' latte that was lightly sweetened, had the perfect hint of brown sugar, and perfectly coffee-ed. The service was a bit slow on the coffee, but it was 30 minutes to closing time and they had a steady inflow of customers, so I totally understand the justified wait. Not to mention, the wait was more than worth it. #newfavoritedessertdestination!",

    "text": "The thought of having gin(ger) and juice on a hot afternoon was comforting so I dashed into 24 Carrots Juice Bar & Cafe thinking that it would serve fresh juice. It does...sort of.  Sadly the flavor of juice I wanted, is not freshly made to order - whaaa? - it was previously extracted earlier in the day. Uh, no thanks, I'll pass on the juice that's been sitting around all day.   Scoped out the pastries and asked about ingredients. Everything that looked appetizing to me was gluten-free. Um, no thanks, I'll pass. If I'm going to eat flour, then I want the dose of gluten that naturally comes with.  Wow, I actually felt awkward. Was I really going to leave empty handed? I turned to the door, I turned to the counter, I turned to the door again. I looked back at the cashier looking back at me to see me looking back at him to decide what I was going to do.   What happened next I know not, but I believe a jedi mind trick was afoot because I was leaving with a big to go bag in hand.  1. Raw jalapeno poppers ($6) - pieces of bell pepper stuffed with spicy almond \"cheese\" and dried cranberries atop field greens. Very tasty. The beginning of this meal was looking quite promising. I think there were four poppers but unfortunately the almond spread wasn't thick enough to stay in the pepper. As I bit, it dribbled all over my shirt and crotch. Mmmm spicy cheese crotch! Eating on the run is a messy business.  2. Zucchini Noodle salad ($9) - spiralized zucchini, veggies, and seed medley atop field greens with choice of tahini or balsamic dressing. Well that zucchini wasn't the only thing spiraling because here's where the meal started to spiral downwards. I didn't see anything resembling a seed medley, and my request for tahini dressing went to no avail. Whatever I got tasted like vinaigrette. Not like. Not happy. So I was left with a beautiful salad of hard veggies that I was no longer interested in eating.   3. Raw Tacos ($12.75) - cabbage cups, walnut meat, avocado, salsa, veggies, cashew cream, and comes with a side. I wasn't given cabbage cups, I was given a couple of flat dehydrated rounds that were used as soft taco shells. They tasted like beans. If you like beans, this will probably be your thing. I DID NOT like it. Also, the walnut meat was a fail for me. From how it tasted, the nuts had been soaked and then mixed with something (not sure what). I would have rather been given plain raw walnuts. And to add insult to injury the avocado slice was badly bruised. The cook should have thrown it out! Not happy with that melange.   4. Bountiful burger ($13) - butternut burger, spiced cranberry chutney, kale slaw, choice of bun or bed of greens, and comes with a side. I was really looking forward to this butternut. I assumed it was butternut squash. Well you know what they say happens when you assume. I have no idea what part of the patty was butternut because all I could taste were beans. Again, if you like beans....this is your dish. The flavor was there, but the beans were a no go for me.   So what started out promising turned into a depressing ending to a meal that could have been wonderful if only I was given the ingredients that I ass u me'd would have been available.",

Top items: raw tacos - delish, I order it every time, walnut \"meat\" and a great raw taco shell I would eat this everyday. Mac and trees - yummy, creamy, noodely. Spinach Artichoke dip appetizer - their vegan cheese is so on point not to mention it comes with lots of dippers. The Blt and breakfast  burrito are awesome and I highly suggest checking out their weekly specials its always changing. They have a dessert counter which includes some very yum and unique sweet treats made in house. They not only do vegan but also cater to other allergens such as gluten and soy free. The people are so friendly happy and chill. The fresh flowers and art is refreshing and lively. Will impress not just veggie heads (ask my dad lol).",

I don't try new things and order the same thing at every spot. I hate change. So...when I saw them advertise smoothies, that is one thing I will try because I LOVE smoothies. I was skeptic due to the fact they're on the vegan side of things but let me tell you...I was shocked to find at the end of my ordered meal it was all gone, and not in the trash. I actually ate it all! Their smoothies are fresh and delicious and definently don't taste all sugary like those artificial places. I live 5 minutes away and between leaving the cafe and getting home my smoothie was gone, literally. I got a BLT but opted with no bread and had them mix it into a salad which was some kind of spicy but good house dressing. Their bacon wasn't real pork but still quite edible. I opted for a few of their gluten free treats as well which were actually quite good considering it's hard to get a good gluten free dessert right. While I can't say this is my first choice, but I most definently will be back, especially for their smoothies. As for the service, the guy taking my order was super nice and my order was brought to me in a reasonable time.",

I brought her rudeness to her attention because I have a low tolerance for bad customer service.  I hope she didn't spit in our food.  Anyways, we ordered the Zucchini Noodle Salad and Dan Dan Noodles.  The Salad should just be called Zucchini Salad because there were hardly any noodles.  The dressing was flat and tasteless,  needs salt or some over seasoning to bring out the flavor.  Adding red onion to the salad would be a good idea too but I know there are a lot of people out there that do not like onion.  The Dan Dan Noodles were excellent...bravo!",

I am not a vegan but like all kinds of food.  Some of the dishes are really good.  The dan-dan noodle bowl (sp?) and nachos are first rate.  Very good.   Some dishes were not good, did not like the veggie burger.  Most disappointing was the hummus, almost flavorless.  There is no excuse for bad hummus, especially at a vegan restaurant and especially considering how good some of their other dishes are.  Some commenters say it is pricey, but prices are typical for this type of place and there is much food prep for fresh ingredients.  My advice is for them to be more like in-and-out burger.  No, I don't mean serve meat, I mean have a simpler menu and concentrate on what they do well - some dishes are really good.  Oh yeah, and fix your hummus.",

    "text": "This is an all vegan restaurant, which is very appealing to me since I associate myself, more and more lately, as vegan. Plus I don't eat any dairy products so it's nice to have good, tasty, and fulfilling meals that I know won't upset my tummy!   Just a heads up, this place is a little pricey! For an entree and dessert for one, I got a total of around $17! But they really do make delicious food that doesn't taste \"averagely vegan\" in the least, so I say it's worth it every once and a while!   Tonight, I had the Southwest Wrap and a lavender cookie sandwich with strawberry filling. The wrap was a little powerful in its cilantro dressing, which kind of overpowered the dish, unfortunately. Toward the end, I just started scraping off the excess filling and just enjoyed the flavor of the homemade, toasty wrap! The dessert took the cake (pun intended?!) for me! The lavender cookie was much like a scone, with biscuity characteristics, and the strawberry filling was sweetly welcomed. The two together paired very nicely.  All in all, of course I will be back! They do have the best vegan dishes on this side of town, by far. They also offer raw too, which is rare and very appreciated. Try the Raw Tacos! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I was excited when I found hat the location us not too far from me, because I have been wanting to try it for a long time.  My first visit was not very positive. I ordered the tacos but asked to hold the jalapenos, because I don't like my food too spicey. I asked to keep some chipotle in, because I like some spice.  As I waited for my food - and I waited a long time - I noticed that the water was empty and asked the gentleman who took my order to refill it.  Eventually my food arrived (at that time I asked for water for a third time; I had asked again while I was waiting for my food). I did not look at my watch, but it took a long time!  The tacos had good flavor but no spices at all. That was very disappointing, because I had asked for milder spices, not to leave them off completely.  In the end, the water was finally refilled as I got ready to leave.  The second time I ate there, I tried the portabello sandwich. It was drenched in sauce and I was unable to even taste the portabello. Big fail! But the service was better this time. Also, when I brought up the issue with the sauce to the gentleman at the register, he offered me a free smoothie at my next visit. That was very nice. The third time is the charme, right?  I ordered the beet burger. It was not bad, even though I had expected more beet flavor.  All in all, I like this place. The fact that they use good quality ingredients and support local farmers is the main reason I will always go back there, but the gender neutral restrooms are a close second. It always looks clean and friendly when you walk in the door.",

    "text": "Fresh, healthy, and vegan are the key words here at 24 Carrots. Prices here are a little high, but you're paying a premium for the quality and freshness of the food they serve.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and the restaurant was bustling with patrons eating tasty brunches. Remembering how empty the previous restaurant, Efe's Turkish Cuisine used to be, it's a welcome change to see a steady stream of customers in this space!  The menu is strictly vegan, and they offer options such as faux burgers made with beet, tofu as egg substitutes, and apple chorizo hash. I decided on the breakfast burrito ($9.75) to go.  Our order was neatly packaged and placed in a nice white shopping bag with utensils and napkins. When we got home, I opened up my to go container to see something that looked more like a breakfast \"wrap\" than a burrito. There were multiple layers of spinach tortilla/wrap holding the ingredients together, and there were a plethora of crisp, leafy greens in the wrap, along with other ingredients such as apple chorizo, scrambled tofu, and garlic sauce. The flavor was fresh, spicy, and an interesting balance of savory and sweet.  My husband got the Arizona bowl, which looked more like a hearty salad rather than a breakfast meal. Despite him wanting to come here specifically, I guess the idea of a vegan breakfast didn't appeal to him after thinking about it, since he promptly cooked up some eggs and bacon and mixed them in with his bowl when we got home!  They also offer smoothies and fruit drinks, which I'd like to try some day.   If you're vegan, vegetarian, or just looking for a healthy meal, 24 Carrots is the place to be.",

I am a meat eater, but do like to go to vegan or vegetarian restaurants every so often. I completely forgot I was not eating bacon.  Super delish sandwich, to say the least.  Their soups are also pretty tasty.  Make sure to check out the soups of the day, since they change often, and I believe they have a cold and a hot soup everyday.  I have tried a couple of their desserts and cannot complain, especially the sugar cookies (oh! yum!).  One thing I noticed was that on Saturday they have Rhiba Farms there, selling local, fresh produce, which looked amazing.  If weren't running errands after that lunch I would've for certain bought some produce there... that was a nice surprise.  Anyway, I do recommend this place for our vegan and vegetarian peoples out there, or if you would like to try some delicious vegan delights, if you are a meat eater! :)",

The food and coffee was so delicious, but oh my goodness, the oil was extremely overwhelming. I eat gluten free because I do not like to feel heavy and weighed down after a meal, but that was not the case today with my burrito. I ended up giving it to my husband who doesn't mind oil and it was even too much for him.   Loved that they have books to read and toys for kids to play with.   Will definitely go back. I will just be sure to order something without oil or request that they don't use it.",

    "text": "Ehhh .....a little bit too healthy for me. Okay - I admit, I just finished 90 minutes of hot yoga and just sweated buckets of water weight. So I thought why not try something healthy. Decided to try 24 Carrots and picked out their Smokey BLT Club and the Pesto Pasta. For you meat eaters I don't think this is the place for you but doesn't hurt to try. ;) Smokey BLT Club - you're thinking bacon, right? Wrong! It's their \"house vegan bacon\" which pretty much is warm firm tofu with some sauce on it, along with avocado, tomato, red onions, greens and aioli sauce covered by a multi grain sandwich bread. Also came with a side of hummus and carrots. If the \"bacon\" wasn't warm then the sandwich wouldn't have been as decent. Content.   Pesto Pasta Primavera -- uh didn't realize that I think I ordered something completely different. Their pesto pasta says it has \"Asparagus, carrot, red peppers, cabbage, kale, but free basil pesto, drizzle cashew cream\" I ate whatever was on the plate bc I was so hungry. I'm looking back on the menu and confirmed I was given the Zucchini Noodles. Wow!! Totally missed that one. Didn't get asparagus. Didn't get red peppers. Didn't get carrots. What??!! Haha - mental note: should have realized there were missing ingredients. Ate it anyway since it was considered healthy.   Overall content but got hungry later. Lesson: look at the plate for missing veggies!",

    "text": "Very few times Yelp has let us down when selecting a new restaurant to try but unfortunately this was one of them.  I do not know how this place can have 4 stars!  I am beginning to think these reviews are by people that do not know what good food is supposed to taste like.  First of all, both Yelp and their website states that they open at 8am. They open at 10am.  We live in Tucson so we were excited to try this place out on our way to Scottsdale. Not cool that they weren't open at 8am like stated.   My husband ordered the Vegan Breakfast Burrito and I ordered the My Favorite French Toast. We also ask if the jalapeno poppers are indeed jalapenos (not sure why my husband asked this question but I guess he had a feeling) and we were assured that they used jalapenos.  We also ordered a side of the apple Soyrizo hash.  Our food arrives and I wish I had taken a picture of my plate.  The description of my French toast reads: Creamy Coconut Custard| Berry Coulis| Cinnamon Sugar Bananas | House Granola Seasonal Fruit Side.  Yah right!  There was no sign of creamy coconut custard only two slices of barely buttered bread with a smear of berry and an entire whole banana with no cinnamon sugar laid across the dry bread.  It had no flavor, the whole banana was weird (should have been at least sliced) and was just not good.  The apple Soyrizo hash was soggy apples, soggy sweet potatoes and soggy white potatoes with no Soyrizo whatsoever.  This \"hash\" had zero flavor and after two bites, I couldn't force myself to take another bite.    My husband's burrito while looked like it should taste good was not.  He said he didn't know how they could have all these ingredients and not have any flavor.  He ate half of it because he was hungry but the rest of the day his stomach hurt.  The \"jalapeno\" poppers arrive and it is some sort of mixture on top of quartered red bell peppers! Now I am very allergic to bell peppers so we tell the server that we do not want this dish and since she had taken our order my husband reminded her that he had asked if they were in fact jalapenos.  She said \"Oh yeah! I'm sorry. I can refund your money\" and we took her up on that offer.",

    "text": "If you're looking for healthy, fresh and delicious vegan and/or raw options, look no further than 24 Carrots.  My first visit here was on Mother's Day of this year. I got a naked breakfast burrito, sans vegan cheese. It was perfectly seasoned and I was so pleasantly surprised by how fresh the veggies tasted.  The breakfast burrito comes with bacon, but my bowl was lacking the veggie bacon. However, I didn't mention the snafu.  My DD ordered Banana Foster pancakes and she let me taste them. They were... interesting? They had a weird consistency; not pancake-y at all. We wondered if maybe they were gluten-free? But again, we didn't ask. The service was good, and I love that we were given our own personal water pitcher.   I finally went back to try some of the lunch items that I'd been eye-balling for months.  Smokey BLT club (no T): I got mine with a side of chips and salsa. Very tasty and flavorful, although I am not a fan of their veggie bacon. It's not firm or crunchy enough for my liking. And I didn't like the salsa; it's very tomato-y, and I don't like tomatoes (hence my holding the \"T\" from the BLT). The aioli sauce on the sandwich was bomb though.  Buffalo Cauliflower wrap: I got mine extra spicy, no celery or carrots, but with a side of carrots and hummus. OMG. Let me tell you... Ask and ye shall receive. *waves church fan* That Sriracha was KICKING! I needed the earth and the wind to calm that fire! It was, however, amazingly delicious. Sometimes, a dish is just all heat, and no flavor. But no. The flavor was definitely present, along with that heat. I like hot and spicy foods, so the watering eyes, burning buds, and duck lips trying to such in the air flow to cool my mouth was all good times for me. For kicks, I'll try it with the normal spice level next time to see how I like it. Excellent dish!  Desserts:  Puddin Pear tart. It was tasty, but not worth the $5.50 they charge for the tiny slither they give you.  Black Forest Cake: Yes! Moist, decadent chocolate cake, with a sweet and creamy icing on top and in the middle, topped with a cherry. Divine! Definitely worth the $6.25.  Lots of smoothie options (I've never tried any of them). 100% vegan, lots of organic and raw options for foods and desserts. Food is always fresh and it's filling, yet light. They support local farms and businesses.  The owner likes to switch up the menu. I like this concept. I keep checking their Facebook page to see when they'll re-introduce the meatloaf that I want so badly to try.   A solid 4.5, but I think some things are over priced, and I don't like the fact that there is still no overhead signage. If you don't know where you're going, it's a pain trying to find it.   Oh, and the hours on here are currently wrong. They are currently open 8am-7pm, Tue-Sat, and 8am-2pm on Sundays; closed Mondays. Not sure if the hours will change come winter, so it's best to call ahead to double check.",

    "text": "I'm really not sure how this place is still open to be completely honest. In the three years I've lived here, I would say I've come to 24 carrots about 8 times give or take. If I'm hungry and in the area I'll stop because I like supporting vegan restaurants every so often and I honestly want to like this place but they make it so hard to do so. Food is mediocre at best and service is always awful. I'm writing because our experience this Saturday was just so bad. We came in around 5 on Saturday and were the only ones there besides a couple who was finishing their dessert. We ordered the pepper poppers, nachos mac and trees and a buffalo wrap. Literally 45 minutes passes and finally a server (if you could call them that ?) Comes to tell us that they are all out of beans and if we wanted to order something else from the menu since \"that's what makes them hearty\" we replied with can you just put  extra of all the other toppings and she said I will have to see if that's okay (like what? Why wouldn't it be okay if I'm not getting a main aspect of the dish because you guys are ill prepared ?) they bring our food over the next 5-10 minutes and it was just all bad. The nachos were literally a bed full of spinach with maybe 25 corn chips with a drizzle of some sort of cashew cream sauce, maybe half an avocado diced and shredded cabbage and carrot. My husband and I literally laughed when we saw it. Poppers aren't worth getting as they are literally just raw red bell pepper and almond cheese. My 18 month old liked the Mac and trees and my husband was content with the buffalo wrap. Anyways my point is y'all really need work on customer service and timeliness on orders and honestly just have the food be more worth the price. We spent nearly fifty dollars and left all feeling kind of hungry and walked over to Trader Joe's to get a snack.. there are way better vegan options through out the valley. But I hope you guys can take all the negative reviews really see what people are saying and make some changes. I wish I had photos of our food to show but we don't bring our phones while having meals.",

So for a solid, delicious, and reasonably priced breakfast and lunch, this is your place.",

We had to go and get a menu to verify what we ordered, as the menu claimed it came with certain things and toppings which did not make it to our plates. The burger has like warm mush that faintly tasted like potatoes. Salad unimpressive as well unfortunately.  $30 down the drain. Tempe and Phx has better options out there we hope...",

I had the \"My Favorite French Toast\", gluten free-afied, and it was delicious. The roasted oats gave it a nice texture while the berries, cinnamon banana, and coconut cream added a sweetness that I could enjoy with out feeling guilty. This place left me smiling! I will be returning and recommend that others give this place a try!",

    "text": "24 Carrots was my last vegan stop during a recent trip to Arizona.  I was hoping to try one of their weekly lunch offerings, but arrived too early!  I settled for a couple of their brunch options and they did not disappoint.  I ordered the Carrot Cake Pancakes and Arizona Bowl.  The pancakes were a great - fluffy with chunks of carrot and pumpkin seeds.  I also had a side of tofu bacon with them and it was really flavorful and had a great texture.  The Arizona Bowl was delicious - a mix of tofu, soyrizo, veggies, spinach, and avocado.  I think that my bowl was missing the cheese and beans, but it was still filling and really tasty.  I also tried a piece of almond coconut chocolate cake, which was yummy as well.  I was there the day after Easter (for which they were closed) so the baked goods and desserts case was empty, they were out of maple syrup, and my bowl seemed to lack a few components.  I understand that it was the day after a holiday, but really wish they had a bit more to offer.  I will definitely return the next time I'm in Arizona with the hopes of trying out more of their offerings!",

They have a great selection of juices, smoothies, and coffee drinks as well as pastries! They've definitely grown over the years! The food itself is usually very good but sometimes it can be hit or miss with the unique recipes. One thing that seems to always be consistent is the amazing people who work here. They are very helpful and polite and always offer great customer service. May not be my go to every night but it is definitely on my list of regular visits!",

I do not have any diet restrictions but a close friend of mine does, so finding places to eat can be difficult. I enjoyed their grilled cheese sandwich, which taste great but not really liked grilled cheese. I would still tell you for try it though as it was very tasty. My friend loved her soft tacos. So far I would recommend for people who are trying to eat more healthy but also have family/friends with diet restrictions like no dairy/gluten. I wish their was more places to eat like 24 carrots.",

I also got a slice of raw lemon creme pie. It has coconut \"cream\" on top. Wow... incredible. The carrots and hummus are delish too. Presentation was great (I am visual and food looking pretty is great!) The staff was really friendly. I couldn't ask for a better experience. I can't wait to come back again. :D",

The atmosphere is great, I love the decor and how they serve you water in your own individual glass bottle for the table. They have a little seating area with couches and board games that would seem to be fun to hang out at night or on a weekend afternoon. With the hours I work it is hard to get there when they are open so I hope with the more business they get, the longer they will stay open!",

    "text": "First time I get to 24 Carrots and the place was closed for interviews.  Next day I showed up at 11:30 a.m and the place was unkept, the pastry case was empty.  I asked if there was any pastries.  Sasha, stated busy morning...........really! you have a business and you don't have any back up for your pastry case? WoW, first impression counts and we are not going back.  It's early and they are out of pastries!  I keep thinking they were just having a bad day, but the place didn't have a sign outside.  It just didn't look like they didn't care.   So I'm a newbie at raw dishes, any suggestions? Nope, don't expect to get any at this place, you will be on your own.  You grab the menu from a stand and figure it out yourself.  It is nothing like the beautiful pictures on the website or facebook...........very deceiving. So, I ordered the Taco Supreme which took forever to get, and it was missing the avocado which states on the menu avocado etc.....didn't get it.  This place disappoints big time.  Our recommendations for starters, get pictures next to your dishes on the menu or an overhead sign with prices and keep your pastries stock 24/7 remember, first impression counts. The water jug with cucumbers, stock cups next them so people don't have to ask for them.  Finally, you need to make up your mind what hours you are going to keep the business going.  You keep changing the hours.  You advertise on your website 8 am. to 2pm but you change the times making it  impossible to ever make it when it is opened and some of us drive from far to experience your food and last but not least  keep it clean and groom well, Sasha and her employees looked sweaty and  disgusting.  This is a restaurant everyone should look clean and presentable.  THE FOOD PICTURES ARE DECEIVING!",

    "text": "We live in the area and decided to try it....I think it is WAY over priced for what you get.  Compared to other places around Tempe and the area like Delish or Greens where main items are between $6-$9, 24 Carrots is charging $11+ for the same items also their juice prices are way to high for the amount!  I went ahead and ordered a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for my kids.  They charged me $5.00 for 1/2 of a sandwich and a few pieces of fruit. It was truly pathetic that they think they can get away with charging that kind of money for literally 1 single piece of bread with about 1 teaspoon of jelly and peanut butter on it that cost them about 20 cents to make.  I don't mind paying for my kids food if they actually get food but if I have to spend $10.00 for 1 full PB&J sandwich then I have to express my concern.  My beet burger was good....not $11 dollars good, unless they lower their prices then I fear they will not be around for a very long time. I went recently to Daily Dose and spent the same amount on a HUGE vegetarian burger and order of kids cheesy pasta for my two small kids to share...we both had leftovers, but not at 24 Carrots we all left hungry.  I should of know by the sign that is posted in the front window that says \"no outside food or drinks\" that others must of tried to bring in cheaper items because they too didn't want to pay for over priced mediocre food either. ;-(",
