Hands down my favorite. The enchilada sauce I could drink. The mini chimis are addicting. I personally love their appetizer platter that has a little bit of everything because I can never decide on just one thing. The service is so genuine and kind. It's all around one of the best Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale.",

We ordered cheese enchiladas, corn tamale, bean burrito & bean tostado. They were pretty heavy handed on the chz on the enchiladas & tostadas. Good news if you like chz. I do but it was too over powering. The service was EXCELLENT. Happy cashier and there was someone in the seating area making sure the customers were good and the place was clean.",

    "text": "I was mildly okay with Julios because it was cheap and it never made extravagant claims to being very good.  It's greasy, overly-cheesed \"Mexican\" food that's bad for you.  Sometimes that's what you want... the large, lousy portions for not much money with shredded bits of iceberg lettuce.  Make no mistake, it's not good, but sometimes we all have our guilty pleasures and sub-adequate Mexican food happens to be one of mine sometimes--usually when I'm hungover or something.  Last time I went there, I popped open a little salsa container for the chips and, Jesus Christ, it was a solidified gelatinous cube.  It wasn't frozen, either.  It was gelatin.  It was this... ugh.  It was denser than Jell-O, too, you could slice it with a plastic knife and it would continue standing on its own.  And that's when I realized that what I was eating wasn't just bad food that's fun to treat yourself too every couple of months or a few times a year, I was eating a pile of failure.  The novelty was gone.  It's all fun and games until you see that salsa.  It's like having fun drinking in a dirty dive bar, then you fall down on a pile of broken glass.  The fun's over... clean up the glass, guys.  Start making fucking salsa in a food processor and take some goddamn pride in what you do.",

I usually stuck with a beef chimi and was pretty satisfied. It comes with rice and beans, plus you get the chips and salsa, so I feel that the price is a fairly decent value.  This past week we went on a Julio's kick so I tried something new. First, the green chili pork chimi. Yum! Instantly replaced the beef in my mind.  Tonight, I tried the pollo magnifico.... Wow. How did I never look at this section on the menu? Loved it. Basically a fundido chimi, lives up to its name! Also, the nachos supreme were quite yummy but got pretty soggy in the take-out container.",

The tacos were as good as I remember and the rice and beans were just the right size, along with some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.   The place itself was welcoming for me because every detail in the lobby was perfect from beer cooler to counters, the floors were spotless and the beverage station was well stocked and gleaming.

She said they get orders called in starting at 9am which I'm not really sure how that affects my call. She obviously knows what orders are ahead of my call.

It is one of my favorite places in the valley to get Mexican food, especially if your just looking for something quick or something to take home with you! I have never tried anything that was not good. Some of my favorites are the tacos, red chili burro and the mini chimi's with jalapeno cream cheese! I also love that they have Mexican sodas in the fridge. Nothing like a Mexican coke to go with your meal!",

So far I have ordered the enchiladas and tacos here and thought they were great. The chicken enchilada was one of the best that I've had so far. The ordering process is simple and I liked the casual atmosphere. I have gone back a few times and had a great experience each time.",

Since it was my first time, thought I'd play it safe with enchiladas. I ordered the 2 items with rice n beans. I chose the chicken enchi and beef enchi. I was impressed!  The sauce was what I was hoping for. I'm glad I found this place. I don't see myself eating here in the heat of Summer but I can definitely see myself getting it to-go. I will definitely be back!",

They are delicious, along with every single thing on the Julio's menu.  The people there are the polite incarnate. They would probably have a funeral for a bird or something. Probably one they don't even know like a raven, or even a pigeon - the rats of the sky. More importantly, whenever I go to have Julio's I have such a good time with their food. The first time I went with a real homie and I got the \"Pollo Magnifico.\" Good doesn't quite capture it. My heart skipped so many beats I developed a heart murmur.   It has a bit of a retro vibe too. It's like if Pulp Fiction was shot within a Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale flair. Except for the busier times, say the weekends, you can always get a seat and your food quite fast.   Every other time after that was a bad experience, not because of Julio's, they were always perfect, but because I tried to introduce possible love interests to this place. I guess there were other things going on that made those relationships not work, but the fait accompli in my mind was that they didn't like Julio's. I mean just because we had dinner somewhere else before why can't you get another snack? You gotta always have room for Julio's.  Through breakups, the woes of relationships, and the bliss of love, Julio's is gonna have your back and always be delish. Stay up fam. Get in there and get a Chimichanga.",

The free chips and salsa (mild) were probably the best part of the this snack. Salsa was in small cups, but fresh and chips were hot and tasty. Big negative is not having horchata, even the counter girl questioned the manager on this big oversight. Decent lunch special - will give the place one more try for the tamale in the near future.",

For my entire adolescence I searched and searched for a tex-mex style restaurant in my hometown area... but alas found nothing. It wasn't until aught nine that I discovered this magnificent shrine to tasteful eats.   Family owned and operated, Julio's provides a warm and friendly environment for the casual diner. The menu is simple yet diverse with plate combinations and creations that are not so easy to find in the sonoran style valley. Looking for  recommendation? Try the Green Chile Relleno plate with a side of love from full timer Steve Rosa. Want  a burrito, well they come in size BIG at Julio's and full of all kinds of fresh ingredients. Need I mention how delicious the FREE chips and salsa are with every meal purchased? And with a handful of good friends the restaurant can quickly turn into a wonderfully amusing adventure into the land great food. All in all, I highly recommend stopping by and not just getting a meal, but maybe making a friend or two at the four stool bar section... I know I have!  xo, Josie",

I've tried several of their dishes but always resort back to my classic/no-frills order: two chicken tacos. These fill me up and have a respectable amount of chicken in them. The fried taco shells and shredded cheese is what I'm really craving but since the chicken actually provides nutrition it's a nice balance.  I don't care for the albonginas soup - too oily. They do a very good job of keeping the salads healthy as long as you don't eat the shell it's a good healthy meal. The nachos are. .... nachos. Order those for your drunk friends. Back to my point - in my experience stick with the tacos if that's what you're in the mood for. I'll choose these tacos over Best Little Taco shop or Blind Pig any day. Ole!",

They have delicious food, friendly service, reasonable prices, and healthy portion sizes.   Everything on the menu is good, but my favorites are the mini chimis (cream cheese sauce is amazing), pork green chili, shredded beef tacos, flautas, and their chimichangas (oh...they are giant and glorious)!  They also have old fashioned sodas, beer, and margaritas to go along with your chips and salsa. Their salsas are excellent, and if you mix the hot with the mild the blend is magical. My only knock on them is that their chips are mediocre at best. Normally I judge a place based on their chips, but in this case the rest of the food makes up for the lack of chip flavor.  If you are in old town Scottsdale with a yen for mex or if you just want a quick take out check it Julios Too!",

I really enjoyed the Pollo Magnifico, but the rice was slightly over cooked and a little mushy, and the beans were over cooked and dry. You get free chips and salsa with your meal. The chips were fresh and the salsa was good. The place has a typical taco stand, cheesy atmosphere, but the service was friendly. Overall I would say this place deserves 3.5 stars, but that's not an option, so I will be kind and give it 4 stars.",

I've never had any issues but the past 2 times I've called in an order and told the time it would be ready it's been a horrible experience. The 1st we had to wait at least 30 minutes past the pick up time and was late getting back to work. Today we waited at least 15 minutes past the pick up time. When speaking to the staff we were degraded and told to call earlier next time. Thing is we did!! Our pick up time was WAY before any lunch rush. The staff didn't seem to give a $&/! that we waited for our food long after it was due. We don't think it was even started until after we showed up. Even tho their food is excellent, I'm not sure if I will come back.",

The first thing was the excellent beer selection right when you walk in!   We stayed in Scottsdale for 3 days and ate there 3 days!  We just flew in from Texas to see a KISS concert, so we know Mexican food.   We weren't expecting much, so the first day we just got a beer and a coke and they gave us free chips and salsa! We were amazed by the huge menu so the next day we got dinners and the food was pretty spectacular for under $20!  I had the pork chili and my wife had spinach enchiladas.  On our third day I had the chili relleno lunch and my wife had the taco salad.  We shared a margarita and still got 2 drinks for under $20!  Awesome.   And then there's the service.  The guys at the counter noticed I was wearing a bacon shirt and we discussed bacon for a minute.  The second day we showed up, I was in a different bacon shirt and we talked bacon some more!   On the third day they were still amazed I had yet another bacon shirt (I have a LOT of bacon shirts).  They were great to have lunch and dinner with!   I really liked the salsa too.  In Texas your salsa is always tomato, jalapeno, onion, and cilantro, but here they got the heat up with some other chiles and seasoning that made it special and good, though what they call hot was still pretty mild for us.   Love, Aaron The Bacon Nation   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baconnation.net&s=31d501ea7b31bf8dc0402f40363ab39f65587f2c8e3dc31f1a96a1987e750942\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">baconnation.net</a>",

Julio's Too is the take-out version of it's big brother Julio G's, the menus are the same but the prices are sure not! Julio's Too is very reasonably priced, and offers the same quality of food as the main restaurant. The lunch specials are amazing, with most being around just $6.00!! They too have my beloved Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and I usually end up ordering a half-pint to take home with me.   I love the flautas, green chile burritos, shredded beef tacos and the mini chimis. Their salsa is very addicting, I just wish that they gave you more with your take-out order. The only flaw I find with Julio's Too is the beans. I am a bean connoisseur, and their beans just do not quite stack up to the others out there. They are just lacking that special something. When I have a craving for Mexican food, I usually lean towards Julio's because it is close to home, fast and cheap, but sometimes when I am really in the mood for some good beans, I have to go somewhere else with better beans!   But even with the questionable beans, I am still there quite frequently.",

She would never order anything of course, and when the food would come she would squirm in her seat, roll her eyes and say, \"Are you seriously going to eat that?\". When I took the lid off my Julio's Too take out, I had a flash back of my anorexic friend and I thought, \"I'm not sure this time.\".   I'm from Texas.  I know TexMex and I love it.  No offense, to the other Yelpers who have used the term, but this is not TexMex.  This is more like a Mexi-Mess!  I ordered the chili relleno and green chili corn tamale which was presented in a foil tin mixed with refried beans and rice.  I'll give them credit for the beans and rice.  That was good, but the rest...hmmmm.  The chili relleno was drowned in a glob of greasy cheese.  I'm not trying to say, that the chili relleno is the healthy choice.  It's breaded and sometimes fried.  It is never soggy or submerged in goo...unless you order from Julio's Too.  As for the green chili tamale.  In Texas, tamales are much smaller.  The corn (or maize as they say) is much more understated allowing the filling to really stand out.  This tamale was like a men's size 12 corn shoe with a little bit if cheese and green chili inside.  It was also, encased in a tomb of cheese that I had to dig through before I finally found the tamale.  I won't go in to the salsa.  The other Yelpers got it right.    Now, I do like the location, the vibe and the service.  I would ride my bike over there for chips and guacamole with friends.  They have a convenience store selection of beverages and a nice patio, which merit an extra star.  I'm not trying to be a jerk with this review, but this is just what I think.",

I give them a high rating because the veggie taco salad has to be one of the best I've ever had, and I've eaten a ton of taco salads. They put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. I also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. The tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. I didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much.",

I was extra angry, however after speaking to the manager, Carlos, and having him investigate whether or not I actually ate there he was still reluctant to refund me the $75 dollars for the tow. Luckily, I recorded the entire conversation I had with the Julios workers on my cell phone and after explaining that if he would not refund me, I would be posting the discriminatory videos to YouTube right away, he finally gave me my $75 back. Needless to say, if you go here make sure not to park in their parking lot and also this place sucks even though they refunded me as it took over a week of dispute and too much effort for them to right their wrong!",

    "text": "Came here for a late lunch as we wanted to try a new Mexican place since we are still desperately looking for our go to Mexican restaurant.  We decided beforehand if the food wasn't going to be good, we would have back up and eat at the W Hotel at Sushi Roku. If you didn't know this, the W Hotel is right across the way.  First and foremost the parking is tight here so whether you're eating inside or outside on the small patio know that you'll have to wait around until someone leaves the lot or park around the corner if you want to be walking distance to your car.  As soon as we walked in were greeted by a nice young girl. She was friendly and directed us towards the lunch menu which was decently priced. As usual, we're still looking for a Mexican restaurant to replace our fave and legendary taco place in Santa Fe, New Mexico called the El Parasol, so we ordered the shredded beef tacos.  The order came with free chips and salsa. The salsa was available in both hot and mild. The food came out on paper plates within 10 minutes of ordering. The food was lukewarm. Beans and rice not hot at all and the taco, while it looked robust, tasted like it was just microwaved. Surprisingly though the taco was filled nicely to the rim with lettuce, cheese, and the shredded beef.  As soon as we took a bite of the (hard shelled) taco we could taste that the taco meat was soft and seasoned nicely but the taco shell was very stiff almost sharp and remember no warmth. The texture and taste was unbalanced. You had soft meat that was enveloped by a shell which to the taste was lukewarm.  Hungry after a 30 minute drive to this restaurant, we both ate the tacos as they were edible and only took 2-3 bites of the rice and beans (since they both were lukewarm in temperature).  Since we were still hungry and on the other side of town there was no turning back...thinking maybe we ordered the wrong thing here and still hungry, we decided to give it another try and order one beef tamale. The tamale was over $5.00. Unlike our lunch combo plates our one tamale took awhile to serve. In fact it was almost 15 minutes before it came out.  When the tamale finally came to our table, we both forked it and each took a bite. We were surprised that the tamale came out hotter then any of the other food we got there. As soon as both swallowed we said the same thing...  The tamale was too salty to eat any further.  Then my husband suggests that maybe it's just the sauce. Or just the meat or just the tamale skin that is salty. Since it was my idea I guess I was going to be the guinea pig. After two bites, I realized that every part of the tamale was over salted and I stopped eating. My husband hates salty food so our meal was officially over. Luckily, Happy Hour was starting at Sushi Roku, our back up place.  While we got good service from the staff and the prices are decent, it's safe to say that we have yet found our go to Mexican place in Arizona.",

I'll be honest, and I'm sure you can relate, When you find a good regular place to go to you kinda get stuck rotating the same few things. I don't ever consider soup unless I'm going to a soup spot, or if am sick. But their soup is sooo good and it's perfect for the cold weather. It definitely has a kick, and if you like the kind that just lingers and reminds you it's there, but still calm enough to enjoy your food, then you should give it a try.   The folks who own it are really kind and they really have a great thing going. Cheers to this beautiful local business!",

The service is quick and everyone is so nice, it really has a home-y feel to it.   They have a good selection of beers, both local and name brands. They cater, and while I've never thrown a party fancy enough to need catering, when I've been to events catered by them the food is still superb.

I had a combo to try some different things. 1) Beef taco - fantastic, the taco shell was fresh and the beef was delicious 2) Red beef tamale - the biggest tamale I have ever seen.  Maybe too big, as the beef flavor was lost 3) Bean burrito - fairly plain, beans and some cheese in a tortilla, no sauce or anything.  The rice and beans were good, and the side of guac I got tasted just like I make at home, so I was happy with it.  The margarita was also decent, nothing fancy but tasty and with a salted cup - not frozen junk out of a machine, but freshly made.  Unfortunately the salsa didn't impress me, but I think that is because I'm used to a thicker salsa.  It was runny with some chili seeds that gave a little kick, but not a lot of flavor.  I'd go back though, I think I'd try a chimi or more tacos next time.",

But no, I was coerced into coming here because they're \"open late\" and my friend swore up down and backwards that it was \"amazing\". I really should have known better because her favorite Mexican place is Arriba-really?! I feel bad for her, because there's so much great Mexican food in this town!   OK, so they decided to extend their hours, but you know what? THEY CUT THEIR MENU TO FIVE ITEMS AFTER 1 AM! Not cool.   Pro: The golf cart that drove us here from Dos Gringos...apparently it's a club shuttle, but has \"Julio's Too\" written all over it, and the guy driving it said he's work for them for 10 years and that the owner of the golf shuttle also owns Julio's Too. This driver claimed everything here was \"delicious\" but couldn't be specific about any item. Hmmmm, I wonder if that's because...  Con: THE FOOD SUCKED. It was just plain bad. I mean, I eat from some grimy burrito places, and their food is AMAZING compared to the stuff they're passing off as food here. Maybe it's because we went late, but either way I decided to play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito that I could barely eat five bites of before completely giving up on it. Others in my party ordered the carne asada burrito (oh, I should mention that I was the only sober one here-everyone in my party was absolutely sloshed), and most of them ate all of it, but later told me how bad it was and what a bad idea it was to eat it. They said they would have much rather gone to a good place (which I agreed with!), and collectively we all agreed never to come here again.   Next time you see the Julio's Too shuttle driver pass by, ask him for a ride to the nearest GOOD Mexican place! Or even the philly cheesesteak place near the bars which is decent. Just stay away from this place.",

Don't bother with the salsa, It comes from a jar. You would have to be really wasted to actually eat here and think it is anything but hideous. Colin S is also correct on the parking. The lot was full but there was no one in the restaurant. One of the worst Mexican restaurants I have had the misfortune of dining at.",

We got the steak fajitas, 3 item combo (beef enchilada, chicken enchilada, chili relleno), and a shredded beef taco salad. Although the taco salad has a great presentation, they skimped on the meat and it was bland. The taco shell was more soggy than crispy. The enchiladas were mediocre at best and the relleno was decent. The only dish that was good enough to get again were the fajitas.   Mix all this in with a near 30 minute wait after ordering at the counter and next time I will head elsewhere. Yelp was a letdown on this one - I assume the reviewers are the entertainment district bar crowd.",

That sucked, ended up finishing it off by using chips to scoop the insides out.   The quesadilla - MASSIVE!! By far, the BIGGEST quesadilla I have ever seen and for such an amazing price. Unbelievable. Tortilla was nice and crispy on the outside and the inside had tons of gooey melted cheese.   Dine-In came with a large basket of fresh crispy chips and little containers of their house made salsa. Mild was tasty. Hot had a nice little bite of smokiness to it.   Carne asada chunks were big, they definitely don't skimp on anything here.   Small spot but good amount of outdoor seating. Over a great little spot. There is a plethora of Mexican/taco/burrito places - if you're looking for inexpensive and huge portion, check this place out.",

It comes with both hot and mild salsa and both were great. For food I ordered the chicken fajita salad that came in a big taco shell. I loved the take on a traditional taco salad with ingredients I liked more. Everyone else in my group ordered different lunch specials and they were really pleased. There are $3 margs all day which is a great deal and they were pretty good.   There were two negatives to this place that took away a star for me. The first was that there were a lot of flies in the restaurant. I know they had the door open a lot so I'm sure they flew in, but it was pretty irritating / gross. It could have just been a random thing though. The second thing isn't a huge deal, but many of their hot sauces were out and they didn't have replacements. They should be sure to stock these appropriately.  Overall I would def recommend for the food. We saw a ton of orders being placed for takeout, and we all agreed if we lived here we would do the same frequently!",

The chefs and servers went out of their way to make sure they got my order correct (I ordered my enchiladas \"Christmas Style\" which is a big thing in New Mexico, but not so much here in AZ, so they wanted to make sure they got it just right! ) I had cheese enchiladas and a tostada as well as the mini chimichangas, and I had enough food for the whole weekend!! The tostada alone would have been a meal by itself, holy cow it was huge!! They serve chips and salsa with the meal and those were really good (I'm a cilantro-hater and there was no cilantro in the salsa, yay!) I can't wait to come back and try the flavored margaritas woot!! They have some really, really cool Historic photos of classic Arizona articles on the wall inside that are really neat to read too...definitely a place to check out for any AZ native who loves to see fun, historic/iconic things!! Right in the heart of Old Town across from the W Hotel with a fantastically huge patio that's puppy-friendly, (also excellent for people watching!)",

It was like this weird soft cartilage but in strips (similar to a sheet of beancurd if you know what that is lol) I lost my appetite after seeing it and went through each chimi only to find there was at least a couple strips in every one.

I've also had just about every taco on the menu and the carnitas as well (which I would never order again). The beans and rice also aren't that good, they're not bad just not that good.

Shredded beef tacos, their queso with spinach (as an app or in an enchilada with chicken) and the best chimichanga I've ever had. Can't say enough good things about this family business. Lovely service....free chips and salsa...cheap drinks. Just go.",

Definitely a good place to go to to grab some lunch! I recommend the smothered burrito or the mini chimis!!!",

    "text": "I went into Julio's yesterday for lunch.  Didn't start with a good impression at all.  When I ordered my margarita I was asked for my ID.  Understandable.  I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10+ years, I get it.  But I didn't even get a smile, or even eye contact.  I then stood there for about 5 minutes while the employees passed around my out-of-state license (I just moved here a few months ago, and I'm 24, btw).  I found this pretty unprofessional.  The older blonde was cashing me out and piled on the attitude.  If she had rolled her eyes one more time, I'm pretty sure they'd roll right out of her head.  The younger gentleman who brought out my burrito put the food down and walked away... that's it.    My point is... if you like food, you miiiiiight like this place, it was mediocre.  If you like good service, don't waste your time.  If I was the owner of this restaurant, I would be embarrassed to employ these people.  They were rude, condescending, and pretenscious.    I had the spinach and chicken burrito.  It was meh.  The margarita was great, but came in a plastic cup... pretty anticlimactic and non-environamentally friendly.  BOOOOOOO!",

If you come for lunch the lunch specials are cheap but you are going to be lethargic when you go back to work. They also have drinks in here which seems kind of random. I've only gotten a margarita here once but it seemed pretty strong for the $3 or whatever it was. Also, you get free chips and salsa which is always a plus in my book. The carne asada tacos are my fave, but I like the taco salad and the green corn tamale is delish as well.",

My husband and I frequent J-Too a lot, I didn't realize how much until today. My husband was on his way home from work, and unfortunately was hit by a red light runner right in front of this restaurant. When I arrived to the scene, one of the employees came out and gave us some cold water bottles, and then said he remembers us from when we dine in, he said he was sorry to see the accident and hopes my husband recovers quickly, then he offered us a discount on dinner. His kindness was so appreciated during this stressful and scary time! Then, while we were eating our meal another customer's car battery died, and I think the manager offered to find jumper cables and help charge their battery. It was so cool to experience and see these guys go the extra step! We'll be back! Thanks again!!",

Based solely on Yelp reviewers we decided to try this place. Even though its a mexican eatery, something about it seemed different. It was.   I had the Lunch Pollo Magnifico that was recommended by the nice lady taking orders. I was hesitant because of the jalapeno sour cream they put on it. I was wrong and that ended up being the piece that brought everything together. This fried burrito was amazing! I'm normally not a fan of chicken in burritos because it always seems dry to me. Not here. The chicken was seasoned and very tender.   If you are in the area and you are able to find a parking spot in their tiny lot, I would recommend stopping here.   One star removed due to the mild salsa tasting like it came from a jar (not from new york city...)",

My five stars is not just for the food, the customer service is phenomenal as well. My wife and I were greeted with warm smiles and friendly demeanors.  I had the three item combo which consisted of a chile relleno, cheese enchilada,  and shredded beef taco. The chile relleno I could tell was freshly made with a perfect crunch, unlike many places that make them ahead of time resulting in a soggy unflavorful mess hidden by loads of crappy sauce and cheese on top. The taco was bursting with authentic Mexican flavor and freshly grated cheese. The enchilada sauce was probably the best I've ever had,  definitely not from a can. My wife had the two taco meal and opted for a chicken and beef taco.  She kept talking about how much they reminded her of the amazing Mexican food we left behind in Orange County,  California, where there is an excellent Mexican place on every corner.   Our meal came with a basket of perfectly fried tortilla chips and delicious salsa.  We had the option of mild or hot salsa and I asked for one of each,  both being yummy. Upon leaving,  we asked to buy a bag of chips to bring back home with us.  The nice young man kindly bagged it for us and said \"no charge,  have a great day\"...a perfect ending to a wonderful experience.",

Mini chimis are always good (hard to mess up), but the things that take more time and effort have been lacking. I think they are not trying hard anymore and it shows by the shorter lines and no one in the restaurant when I go.  Now, I just go to order mini chimis for my kids and go some place else for me. Sad, this used to be a staple in my family.",

They loaded my bag with 3 cups of mild salsa, chips, and the beef taco. I lived in San Diego for 4 years and found the quality to be pretty authentic.

Juilo's  Too fits the bill. I always check out Yelp reviews to see what people have to say about a place I might go to . I was in the mood for tamales. A fellow Yelper said he had been coming to Julio's for the past 25 years for the Green Chile Tamales. I order the 3 item combo getting 2 Green Chile Tamales and one Red Beef Tamale. With a container of black beans and some rice the huge plate of food was not what I expected. I The Red Beef Tamale was very good but like the fellow Yelper said the star of my dish was the Green Chile Tamale. All 3 tamales were huge. The Red Beef Tamale had a very nice  Ranchero sauce. All of the tamales were smothered with cheese. My wife had a 2 item combo with a Black Bean Burrito and the Spinach Enchilada. Both dish were packed with so much food we didn't even eat a quarter of the great chips and salsa that comes before the meal. They have all day $2.50 margaritas which were nice. We had leftover galore. For under $35 we ate like royalty. Service was informative and very friendly. We  definitely  found a gem of a Mexican restaurant that is not fancy but has great food.

Bottled beer as well as margaritas are available. It is a nice touch for a limited service restaurant. The decor is a little out dated but not distracting. There is also a nice dining patio out front.   I stopped in for for lunch by myself (don't tell the Blonde) and ordered a taco salad. This came with a side of chips and salsa. The mild salsa was had well developed flavor with out being heavy on tomatoes. The house fried corn chips were light, crunchy and not greasy.    The taco salad shell was slightly over cooked and there were a few carrots in the salad mix. I suspect they are using a prepackaged salad mix. I ordered my taco salad with shredded beef. It was lightly seasoned letting the flavor of the slow cooked beef shine through. The taco salad was topped with a generous amount of sour cream and guacamole.     The staff was very helpful and courteous. They are attentive to the dining room and quickly replaced the Dr. Pepper when it ran out, delivered meals quickly and accurately, and offered to refill chips and salsa. Overall, a nice place for an quick inexpensive meal. They have plenty of off street parking, too.  Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff) -Clean inviting building. -Pleasant attentive staff -Generous portions. -Beer and Margaritas. -Off street parking (this is huge considering the location).  Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff) -Dated decor. -possibly too quiet (I don't remember any background music).",
