    "text": "In a nutshell: Beers great. Food needs work. We stopped by around 6 on a Saturday. I got a flight, hubby got a pint, so we had 7 beers between the two of us and every beer was delicious. It's obviously a working brewery and they want you to know it - visible fermentation was going on at least one tank, and they'd left several 50-pound bags of malt hanging out in a corner. The food sadly was another story. Hub had the fish & chips; flavor was good but everything on the tray was soggy! If you bring me battered and fried food, it'd better be crisp. I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich, which had good flavor, probably the best thing on our table food-wise, but again came with soggy fries. Boo! If they can sort out their fryers, I'll definitely bump them to 4 stars. But until then, hey folks, work on your food. Brewpub eats are more than just something to fill a hungry stomach between beers.",

Whenever I sit at the tables, the servers are always outstanding, personable, and helpful. The food arrives unbelievably quickly. I don't know how they turn out their food so fast.   I have only experienced two recurring problems here, which is why I am not giving the place five stars. First, the biggest problem with this otherwise amazing place has to do with the hostesses. Most times when I come in, nobody is at the hostess station. They seem to disappear a lot. Lines form and people are waiting even though tables are clearly available. This has happened to me multiple times. I don't know if they need to hire additional hosts/hostesses or re-engineer how they do their work, but having to hang around at the hostess station for 5 or 10 minutes is not cool.  Second, the service quality at the bar is uneven. Sometimes it is amazing, but I've noticed that there are certain bartenders who are much less attentive than others. There were several times where I have finished a beer and have had to wait quite a while for a refill. Or had to wait a long time trying to pay my bill. Let me be clear - some of the bartenders are awesome, but some not so much.   Absent the hostess station issue and the uneven quality of service at the bar, I would have given this place a (rare) 5-star rating.",

If you start your day off here (hopefully to enjoy some football), it's a good idea to have one of their well crafted spicy bloody mary's with a breakfast platter that has some of the best & most flavorful seasoned sausage patties.   For lunch or dinner, ya count go wrong with their crispy & flaky Walleye w/Chips, The juicy Bison burger, or Mac & cheese.   Also, having nearly done a county wide tasting survey, I'm pretty confident to say their HOT pub pretzel with beer cheese is the best pretzel in town.   Their East End Amber is usually my go to pint here, but it's always a must to see what guest brews are being tapped. Be warned tho, sometimes irresponsible consumption of brews may result in drunk purchases being made next door at Pier 1 Imports.  Now if only they would bring back that Wonton Chicken Salad...",

The atmosphere is roomy and comfortable and service was friendly and efficient on my last two visits.  We started sharing a half order of the three cheddar, two ale cheese and mac with truffled parm crust. No denying this dish was tasty and layered with flavors and texture due to the delicate tasty crust bursting with truffle essence.  I came back to try the wild walleye in beer batter. It came with a very tasty fresh slaw that was heavy with celery seeds and other flavors. Nicely seasoned tarter sauce and a MOUNTAIN of hand cut fries. I got a very generous amount of meaty mild fresh tasting fish in a beer laced batter. I thought all the flavors were delicious but I think the batter was slightly off being donut like in texture and that's the reason I'm lowing the 5 stars to 4 stars because the batter was still good but not perfect. I looked at photos from other people's walleye and I do see I didn't get what they got. I do note that I feel that this is a very good restaurant to eat at and on my visit possibly due to someone new cooking or a slight slip in the recipe I got something less than what they normally serve.  I was absolutely blown away with what I ordered last time and hope to bring them back up to five stars next time.",

The beer selection changes regularly but features the in-house craft beers along with a variety of guest taps. I've backed away from the in-your-face hops-forward styles as I've grown older, and tend to go with ambers or less aggressive session lagers. But this place features a wide enough selection to fit nearly any beer palate.  Let's talk about the food. The wings are quite decent... and especially savory since they are smoked. They feature beef jerky on the menu (strangely, with creme fraiche on the side). Cheddar and bacon tater tots are oddly large, but quite snackable. The other standard pub grub offerings are here, but always with a little twist, for example, the fish and chips plate features walleye.  I have to praise them for their standout menu items. The house-made andouille is fantastic. And their poutine in brown ale gravy is downright mop-uppable. But I am also thankful that amongst the standard fare they include lighter-carb fare such as brussels sprouts and roasted cauliflower.  The service is always friendly and this place seems to have been busy ever since they opened a few years back. Count me amongst the regulars!",

Next came the half order of mac and cheese.. Not our cup of tea.. Our 3 year old spit it out instantly, ironically the only person at the table that enjoyed it was out 1 year old, but seeing how he also eat play-doh I wouldn't read to high into that.    My wife and I each ordered a different sandwich. She the grilled chicken and myself the pulled pork. The grilled chicken was flavorful, but too flavorful. Really the only flavor either of us could taste was lime. My pulled pork was very good however, the fries were a different story.    I wanted to give their beers a chance so I ordered a flight of 6 different beers to try. To be honest I had a hard time even picking six as it seems most of their beers lean towards heavier beers such as ipa's and porters. Seemed odd for a warmer climate. Half the beers I tried were average to pretty good. The other half I left in the glass after tasting as they were not worth finishing.",

They need to go eat at Zinc Bistro to see how it should be prepared.  When the meatloaf came out the presentation was the same as Alice Coopers Cooperstown restaurant, Mega Death Meatloaf. After trying it that's as far as it went. Meatloaf fell apart on our forks. No crustiness to the meatloaf at all. Mash potatoes and green beans were good.  For the prices being charged the food and beer just wasn't very good. Won't go back as these were supposed to be their signature dishes.  Hostess and wait staff were extreme courteous. That's the best I can say about our night. All hard surfaces and extremely loud.",

Walleye fish and chips for the wife and a great medium rare cheeseburger for me. Beer battered and crunchy fish and great fries. The beef was clearly fresh and cooked perfectly with a locally made bun. Out bartender/server \"Sam\" was delightful and attentive. I would suggest ownership tell their story either on the menu or somewhere within the establishment. Folks this place is local, supports local purveyors and prides itself on quality.

Those are mighty tasty and such a huge portion we shared. (Table of four) I had a strange request.... and wahalah.... warm wort taster .... I'd visited heaven. I also had a side of potato salad. All four of us enjoyed our meal, and our visit. We were lucky enough to be there at a time when the wort could be scooped out. And Autumn was offered a treat at the end.

I always try to make a point of stopping by when I'm in the area. We recently tried their fish n chips and they were simply amazing. I still haven't found a beer that I didn't like and all the food has been great. Good job SBC!",

I often think about food when running/exercising/hiking/swimming... As soon as I got out of the pool, I searched on burger place near the pool and this place came up on my search.  When I arrived after lunch hours, they weren't too busy and got seated nicely at comfy booth.  Just happened to be it was during happy hour and they had nice price for food and beer. TVs are throughout, it was the first day of the NFL and I enjoyed watching some games while enjoying my food.  For my burger, I added fried egg for $1.50.  Either I was really hungry or this burger is really tasty, (or could be a little of both), I quickly ate the whole thing so fast. If I were to come back when I am not hungry, not sure it will still taste as good but the time I ate, this burger really hit the spot and I was happy.  They have so many different craft beer. Not much of beer drinker here but whatever I had was just what I needed after swimming for a long time.  Friendly service, good food, good beer, plenty of TVs,.. Perfect way to spend Sunday.",

It comes with an over easy egg, melty American cheese, and perfectly crisp bacon with a maple pepper butter on top of a sweet challah bun to give the perfect sweet, savory, salty, cheesy combo. The French fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They have all day $5 margaritas, bloody Mary's, and mimosas all weekend. Their patio is a decent size and is dog friendly which is always a plus. It's a great relaxing atmosphere with a knowledgeable friendly staff. Their beers are consistently phenomenal and they have an awesome variety. There is literally nothing negative I can say about this place, that's how much I like it! If you're in the area, DEFINITELY give this place a try.",

Hostess proceeded to seat other patrons who all arrived AFTER us with the same party size. 5-mins turns to 10-mins. At 10-min mark I revisit hostess stand. Hostess reassures me I'm next. More patrons walk in. Those patrons are seated immediately... again, same party size. 10-mins turns to 15-min... 15-turns to 20-min. At the 20-min mark, all hope is lost and we walk out.",

The bison burger with tomato jam can't be beat and the tacos were were also tasty with a unique twist of a peanut topping. We also enjoyed the unique flavor of the pickle potato chips.  We will be back.",

None were spectacular but really enjoyed the galactic IPA, the Dank Triple and the Rico's Revenge Red IPA. The grilled chicken sandwich was awesome but the fries were a let down. They could have been amazing. There method of cooking and serving is spot on but the shitty potatoes ruined it. If I could post a pic of the pile of rotten ones it would make you go WOW!!!  Coming back??  Hmmmm??   Maybe give it another chance!!!",

    "text": "We headed to Scottsdale Beer Company on its opening night for a friend's birthday.  We ended up having about 10 people squished into a couple of tables.  I know it was opening night, but this place definitely has room for improvement!  They didn't have a beer list.  Not on the menu.  Not written on the massive chalkboards on the wall.  Nothing.  Our waitress got a little flustered any time someone would ask about drinks.  I don't get why they didn't just write down a temporary list on one of the blank chalkboards that weren't designed yet.  This seemed odd to me.  They also didn't have most of their house brews ready yet.  It seems weird to move forward with your opening before the Beer part of your name is ready.  The food as okay.  I had the fish and chips, which is not something I typically order.  It was pretty good - I have no complaints.  My boyfriend had the vegetarian pot-pie.  I tried a couple of bites and it was pretty good as well.  It was a HUGE portion with only a little bit of crust on top.  We ended up getting a to-go container to use some of the filling as baked potato toppings the next day!    The service was slow.  Our waitress seemed to dread helping our table.  When it came time for the bill, it wasn't split, so she had difficulty remembering who ordered what. I wasn't there when the party was seated, so maybe it was their fault for not initially telling her that some people would likely want to have separate bills.    Overall, we had an okay experience.  Because of its location, I can predict that we will be back, simply because there aren't a lot of great places to grab a beer in our neighborhood.  I'm hopeful that they will work out some kinks before we head back!",

Its cool to see how they make their craft beer.  We decided to sit at the bar thinking we would get good service maybe talk to the bartender. He served our craft beer immediately, the food took some time to come out. We ordered the Mac n cheese and fried pickles.  Ok, so here is where we had our problem. You can tell the fried pickles came out of a jar straight into the deep frier. It wasn't coated, they were just some greesy bland, no flavor pickles. The Mac n cheese was also very bland and looked like it had a puddle of oil sitting on top. It was over priced for the quality. After we ate, usually the bartender would take your plate after you finish, but they stacked up in front of us along with our glasses of beer. The only time the bartender came around was to serve the beer, other than that he didn't acknowledge us sitting there. This other female bartender was too busy flirting with this guy sitting next to us. I'm a craft beer advocate and we thought we would give this place a try. I don't think I would be returning. Make some changes with the food and staff.",

I enjoyed the grilled bacon wrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes,  green beans and sauteed mushrooms. Delicious! My husband enjoyed his fish n chips, made with Walleye Pike. The chef is from the Midwest, and he suggested the Pike instead of the usual cod. Another hit! It is rare that we try a new place and ALL of us get something we love, but Scottsdale Beer Company  did it. Our waiter talked us into trying a desert of Sticky Toffee-Pumpkin Pudding. OMG. The three of us shared it. Three thumbs up! We will be back often.",

I joined their loyalty program and the send me emails of promotional beers they make for holidays, Etc. Pretty cool  3. It's also very low key, it's not insanely busy like some of the restaurants in downtown Scottsdale and u get a good crowd of people from families to first dates, etc.   This place kind of reminds me of yard house but wayyyyyy better. No pretentious people, mom and pop real brewery, food way better than yard house and at a fraction of the price...  Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "I am home now (in Denver) and finally writing this review from last week.  Not going to lie, I am welling up with tears because I miss this place!  There are MANY new breweries in the Scottsdale area, so this place has some stiff competition right out of the gate.  Naturally, in order to make an informed assessment, my husband and I tried as many as we could in a five-day trip.  (Intentionally, leaving some for next time).  Let me just say, the Scottsdale Beer Company did NOT disappoint.  We did not have a wait the first time, and stuck just to beer.  We of course sampled 8 - with two being the hands down favorites - the Big Mouth Blonde and the Easy Rye'd Pale Ale.  GoodNESS this place does a fine beer!  The selection is vast, so you'll be hard pressed not to find something that appeals to your tastebuds.  Second visit - beers (shocking, I know) and dinner.  We were apparently a bit indecisive (and hungry) because we started with three appetizers:  Pub Pretzels (beer cheese sauce so delicious I wanted to bring it home and put it on everything from pretzels to my toothbrush); roasted peanuts (raise an eyebrow to the \"cajun spice, dried fruit, bacon - then ask yourself how you can possibly get handfuls into your mouth faster); and the overall crowd pleaser - Fried Brussel Sprouts.  Now let me tell you, I KNOW my sprouts!  I've tried everything from maple-syrup to brown-sugar-balsamic, to butter-lemon-garlic, to who knows what?  These little bundles of magic however, are unprecedented, with roasted peanuts, bacon (duh) and a light and refreshing honey-mustard sauce that literally left us wanting to drag our fingers through to clean the serving dish in a way that would have saved the dishwasher time and energy!  Pure heaven, and HOT!  Woohoo - HOT!!  On to dinner - we split the Andouille Sausages with grits and shrimp gravy.  The sausage was really delicious - although be prepared for a more-than-usual \"smokey\" taste.  The grits and gravy (that had large pieces of shrimp) were just plain to die for.  Again, high-five us for winning the clean-plate-contest on this one!  On our other visit, we had the house-made chips - oh holy crap these things are amazing!  PERFECTLY sliced and fried, and some seasoning that smacks of perfect salt-lemon-butter-heaven-delightfulness that is remarkable!!  I don't know exactly what it is, and quite frankly, don't care!  We had some leftover, and I kid you not, and brought them home (and I mean all the way home to Denver, carefully packaged and packed in my suitcase).    The service was outstanding; in fact we were quoted a time that was longer than the actual wait when we arrived.  Love that!  The establishment is well kept up, and clean.  Good for kids.  We will definitely be back, and next time, hope to enjoy the welcoming patio!",

While the atmosphere beats a lot of typical sports bars, to our dismay, the food was dismal!    Don't know what has happened since the last time visiting this establishment 4-5 months ago, but the food has gone downhill and prices gone up!   Salad greens looked a good 3 days old, if not older, cole slaw equally aged (and not in a good way)  While the fish was good on the fish and chips, they charged extra for another small cup of tartar sauce.  Extremely small wine pours for the price.  The fried pickles were hardly discernible as pickles...more like some small glob of cornmeal with a dill flavor. Our first server seemed friendly enough, but was replaced by someone who acted like more of a \"manager\".  Unfortunately, she needs to learn some customer service skills.  Grumpy and not apologetic about the globs she presented as fried pickles. Will not be back. So disappointed, @ScottsdaleBeerCompany!  Update: became ill a few hours after the meal.  Either the fish or the slaw was bad.",

The BBQ chicken was very dry and tough to chew, the smothered fries were okay as were the wings. The shrimp po boy however was pretty good. The real kicker was the service. The very first thing I order was the BBQ chicken... My boyfriend eventually got his food... And I sat without for about 10 minutes (I understand chicken can take longer than other things)... But nothing ever came. We asked the waitress and she said I never ordered it... If there is one thing a pregnant lady never forgets to do... It's order her food. We didn't receive so much as an apology until the chicken came out...",

There was a good variety of beers to choose from. My favorite was the East End Amber Ale.  The appetizers menu had a good amount of options. Entrees eaten by my party were the bison burger and the shrimp po boy. Both were delicious and well-portioned.  The establishment seems to be festive and I'm sure is pretty cool at night. I'd recommend.",

The food was amazing, great burger, fish and chips were on point, and the FRIED PICKLES is a must if you come here!  If I didn't have to study I would have grabbed an IPA, but all more the reason for me to come back after finals!  On a Final note the staff was super attentive and very friendly!",

My wife had a salad which she said was excellent. They also have a full bar and an excellent selection of their own beers. Food was not expensive. We will try it again on future trips for casual dining in Scottsdale.",

The restaurant/brewery is very large with a huge bar and tons of table seating.  The service was average and we did not have any food, but the menu did look really good.  Many of the food items looked tasty and interesting.  I wasn't as excited about the beer menu.  I mean, it looked good, just not as large of a variety as I would like to see.  I did try two, the Bandito Brown (ok) and the Texas Tea Double Chocolate Imperial Stout (good).",

SBC is a brewpub, though like most brewpubs, they influenced me more with their beer than their food. No knock on the latter, but it's the beer that will keep me coming back. The Texas Tea Stout, NE IPA and American Barleywine were all quite good and I sampled a few other styles that hit the spot as well. Anything from flights to growlers are available to assist with sampling as many, or as a few, beers as you'd like. With over a dozen of their own beers to try, as well as a few guest taps, there shouldn't be a shortage of options for most.  I ordered the tuna tacos on one trip, as well as the ham sandwich on another (which somewhat surprisingly came highly rated by multiple employees) and everything was fine - good bar food to accompany better beer.",

    "text": "I'm always on the search for a good brewery and especially when in another city. While in the fine city of Scottsdale, Scottsdale Beer Co should be towards the top of your list if you're like me.  SBC is a brewery restaurant with a full, killer food menu and a killer beer menu as well. So for brunch, lunch, dinner or drinks, SBC has you covered. The place is clean, well lit, has a great welcoming atmosphere and overall just a great vibe to it.  As for their beers, I opted for the East Coast Grove New England style IPA since I've been a real fan of those as of late. This one didn't disappoint either, hazy, citrusy, tasty. I liked it so much that I had them fill a crowler of it so that I could take it home with me. The girl working the bar was friendly too which is always a plus and makes transactions go smoothly.  Additionally, if you follow their social media they often announce events and crowler fill specials which definitely sweeten the deal.  I don't live in Scottsdale but you better believe that when I'm in town, SBC is going to be towards the top of my list when I need to grab a bite, a beer or a crowler of something to go...or hell, maybe all three!  The server's name on my receipt was \"Danny Noonan.\"   \"Are you my pal Mr. Scholarship winner?\"   Caddyshack references? Hell yeah. I'm definitely a fan.",

In visits past, bartenders would OFFER samples of everything I'd ask about, as well as suggest I try samples of what they thought I'd enjoy based on what I'd told them.  I was only able to ask for two samples, and I could tell by her body language that she didn't want to.  No suggestions.  Whatever.  I don't have to spend extra for a pint of beer that I most likely won't finish half of anyway.  And forget about the $8 dessert.  I'll just get something to eat and be on my way, thanks.  Tried the Grilled chicken sandwich.  Salad or fries, or upgrade to sweet potato fries for $1.50 extra?  Fries, please.  [I've had their sweet potato fries before, and asked for their special house-made BBQ ketchup (regular corn syrup-based ketchup with their special sauce mixed in) on the side-- the fries came with ketchup all over them.  Would've been OK without the sauce.]  Ten to fifteen minutes later, my sandwich and fries arrived, and the chicken is BLACK with char.  Please re-make?  I munched on the fries as I waited.  Ten minutes later, and a new sandwich and more fries arrived.  Chicken still charred, just slightly-less.  Oh, well.  Olive oil bread was alright.  The dressing on the slaw, which topped the chicken, was too acidic.  Ate a few bites and took the rest home.  Re-heated fries (toaster oven) were very salty.  One or two more visits and then I'm done here.",

Slow service, food was served luke-warm, and we had to call her over twice to ask for beer refill.  I guess that side work and the cute guy at the bar were more important then her seated customers. The food was made to look fancy (gastro-pub pub like) but SMALL portions and everything was too salty! On a positive note, they had good music and the industrial-look decor was pretty neat. Probably will not be back.",

For my entree I had Burnt Ends Fried Rice which is basically just a mess on a plate of meat, eggs, veggies, and fried rice. It sounds weird, but it is delicious. To cap it all off the beer is outstanding. I am an IPA fan and they had several on tap, which were all delicious. Overall, great food, beer, and environment.

I personally liked the meatloaf and everything else I have tried so far. The kitchen staff know what's going on. Quality ingredients prepared by people who care.

We came on playoff game day and it was pretty pedestrian, but no major team alliance here; which is fine in my books I don't really care for belligerent fans!  We were happy such a craft brewery was so close to us.  Still pretty new for sure since they're working on some drinks.  I just went for a light lager since when it comes to craft brews; I'm lost haha!  For food, we ordered the fried pickles, pretzels, and for the entree I shot for the regular house burger.    The pickles I must say is the best I had around.  Lightly breaded and the pickles were solid instead of limp like most places.  The pretzels were decent; must say I didn't generally care for the beer mixed cheese thingy.  As for the burger I thought it was pretty solid; nice and juicy while the patty and bun ratio was perfect.  It was accompanied by smoked bacon, cheese curds, garlic aioli, on a challah bun.    Service was pretty good and on top of things and the ambiance still needs a pickup; needless to say still pretty new joint. - Enjoy!",

    "text": "My first thoughts when I walked in were \"wow this a nice big attractive place\".  The large bar is right in front and has seating and TVs all around which I like.  There are plenty of high and low tables and a nice outside patio.  With the doors rolled up you get a lot of fresh air when you're sitting inside and I love the big glass windows that look into the brewing area.  I sat at the bar and didn't see a list of beers anywhere and a lot of the taps aren't marked even if you can see that far.  The waitress rattled off the beers but c'mon a real beer geek wants to see the details on the brewer, style, abv and ibu's.  It wasn't until later in the evening when they printed up a list that I could see everything they carried including a couple that the bartender didn't mention.  I tried their pale ale and thought it was just Ok.  The flavors were a little muted and I'd love a little more citrus and pine flavor.  I ended up drinking an Avery Dugana and a Bell's Two-hearted which were great.  For happy hour my friend and I shared the hummus plate and a burger.  The white bean hummus was good but the flatbread was really tough to chew.  The burger was OK as was the mac and cheese side.  The mac and cheese would have been better if they added something like bread crumbs on top and then browned it to give it some crunch.  I'll be interested to try some of their other beers.  Arizona Wilderness and Fate Brewing down the road are doing a great job with their own creations.  It will be interesting to see if SBC can gather a following for their beers or just be another place to grab a craft beer on a rotating handle with average food.",

Shared Stuffed Tater Tots, Fried Pickles, Street Tacos, and Mac n Cheese. All were yummy! The fried pickles were a little different than I'm used to, they were very finely cut chips that were lightly battered and fried. Not 'different' in a bad way, good different. I usually prefer the spears because of the higher pickle-to-fried ratio, these were quite yummy! Beers available - the list isn't huge but since everything on the list was made there I'm going to say it's a good sized list. I asked our waitress about the non hoppier beers and she did a great job of helping us choose and brought samples sips. Those little samples came in snifter glasses, it was awesome because you could REALLY smell the beer before you took a sip!  Might have to go back for actual food and take the hubs!!!",

(we are clutzy people and have knocked many a thing off a high table while talking with our hands)  We've had a ton off the menu, latest was the mac n cheese, veggie burger, boyf had the meatloaf, warm pub pretzels, house chips.   The mac n cheese is HUGE, and great for left overs, and overs and overs. Also the veggie burger is amazing and made in house. The homemade chips are divine.

    "text": "Decent selection of beer here, but I'm a very big fan of the food. You get huge portions, and it tastes great.  Definitely a fan of their more edgy dishes. For once, their poutine is one of the most authentic I've had from the brown gravy to the cheese curds. The giant tater tots are a perfect marriage between loaded potato skins and tots. The house jerky is a great peppery bite. And the triple cooked wings maintain a great smoky flavor - though I do warn against chef's whim - sometimes that whim means no sauce at all!  In terms of the entrees, I appreciate them all. The burnt ends fried rice was a decent cross between Asian and southern cooking right down the middle, and the mac and cheese is very generous with plenty of customization. If you come for brunch on the weekends, the donuts have a great sugary bite and the pancakes are very hearty (with bacon cooked in too!).  I've had Nitros, stouts, and porters here, but you'll find plenty of IPAs and ales too. I was pretty happy with everything I got, and it's a good range from local breweries to in house. Selection can change in as little as a week too, which I like.  I've been to similar joints like OHSO, Fate, and Four Peaks, but I definitely believe SBC is leading the pack in terms of food. No doubt I'll be back.",

We came at like 2:30 on a Friday and there were not too many people there. We were seated quickly and I was happy to see some great veggie options on the menu for me! My friend was happy to see lots of meat options for him. And it was cool because we were seated right by the little brewery, and there are windows so we could look in. My friend ordered two beers, and he really enjoyed them. I usually don't like beer, but I had a sip and thought it tasted pretty good!  For food I ordered a quinoa burger, had fries as my side. I'd honestly say it's on my top 5 list of veggie burgers in the area..and I've had a lot! The flavor was good, very fresh, I especially liked the pickled veggies on top of it. My friend got a burger and he was very excited it came with cheese curds. He was disappointed when he got it and realized the cheese curds were melted on top, not on the side or fried. But otherwise he said it was a good burger. Prices are reasonable too. My only complaint was that the service got really slow towards the end, like took forever for us to get out check and then pay. Spent a long time there! But we enjoyed it, I'd come back for sure.",

The food was also phenomenal, but I was a little disappointed in that I ordered sweet potato fries and they accidentally sent chips instead.

At first I thought it was just bad because it was cold, but that wasn't it.  Some things are so overly flavored or salty or something that they are nearly inedible (cauliflower app, sprouts app, hummus) while other items were so bland and tasteless (mac n cheese, Korean bimibap, soup) that I thought I lost my sense of taste halfway through the meal.  I heard they've gone through a few different chefs recently...and it shows.  The burger used to be fantastic but I think they changed it too.  And the cookie skillet is a joke.  Burnt and undercooked at the same time is hard to do.  Clearly no oversight in the kitchen.  Maybe they're just too busy for what they're trying to do back there...?  Idk but I hope they figure it out soon.",

I had asked our server, that when she brings our lunch so she wouldn't have to go back, to please bring extra lemons and tartar sauce, which she did. Everything was fine..the lunch...the service. Upon receiving our check,  we saw a 50 cent charge for the extra tartar sauce. First of all, never had we ever seen this in any restaurant no matter what the price point was AND the server has a responsibility to the patrons,  to say there will be an additional charge for the sauce and not just put it on the check.  It's only 50 cents, but that says something about the integrity of the establishment. Based on that alone, I probably will never return, which is a shame,  as we live in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   Ahhh the incestuous life of Phoenix's restaurant industry, and we are just merely the pawns that bring our cash and lay it at the door, so another project may take place.  And today, I find myself at Scottsdale Beer Company, and even being here was not free will, but the divine intervention of the Yelp Elite.  SCOTTSDALE BEER COMPANY  Let's start at the beginning...  In 2013, partners Douglas Ledger and Tom Davidson noticed an increase in craft beer sales, estimated at $14.3 billion share value, and an open craft beer market in the Phoenix area, with less than 50 microbreweries in total.  Some of these microbrewery hot-spots include O.H.S.O., Freak'N Brewery, and other hip Yelp faves with large beer lists, like Sip, Taphouse, and Craft 64.  With these in mind, Ledger put in motion creating Scottsdale Beer Company, enlisting the help of Studio K's Kimberly Harris (the design behind Vig II, Zinc Bistro, and ShinBay), originally with Chef Donald Fawcett (Pink Pony and Salty Sow), and now Chef Justin Olsen, and my favorite, Master Brewer, Brad Williams.  So, the two seasoned businessmen saw a niche, found some solid players, made a bar, advertised on Yelp, Yelp puts out the word to Yelp Elites, Yelp Elite Brett B \"suggests\" we \"try\" Scottsdale Beer Company, and voila, cut to me.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I've been to Scottsdale Beer Company a couple times, originally as Yelp Elite Brett B's guest.   I visited again today, and it was almost an identical experience; well, minus Brett.  Scottsdale Beer Company looks dull from Shea Blvd.  The pizazz is all in the interior. It's got flash lighting fixtures, an open industrial vibe and a full bar, and the glorious brewing tanks area.  The staff is all flash and mostly vapid; SUPER great looking, but not much depth. My bartender was Jerry, a super great guy.  Jerry gave me three samples, Big Mouth Blonde, Cannonball Pale Ale, and Pineapple Sour. I chose a full glass of the Pineapple: VERY TASTY!  During my previous visit, I shared the Mac 'n Cheese and BLT with Brett. I enjoyed both; the Mac 'n Cheese was scrumptious.  My highlight: I had the privilege of meeting the Head Brewer Brad Williams, who generously gave me the grand tour of the brewing process.  I'm am convinced that all of the depth and meaning comes from Brad. Not only is Brad the brains behind the brews, he's also most of the brawn, with help from his co-worker, Snake.  The clientele was mostly chubby beer-belly pet food salesmen, who claimed they were regulars. Their belly's definitely back up that claim.  CONCLUSION  Scottsdale Beer Company wants your money, and in exchange, they offer a flash bar, tasty beers, good food, and sexy servers.  4/5 RECOMMEND   *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscottsdalebeercompany.com&s=9669dd7589ffcaa015978dfa69bb4c164b252d83a7247d03b1d931712623eed8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">scottsdalebeercompany.com</a>",

Parking can be a bit of a challenge at times since it's next to several other shopping/restaurants but very cool spot, good service and awesome food. My bf and I thought the food was even better than cold beers and cheeseburgers which is our usual hangout spot. My bf got a burger and chips which wasn't greasy at all. He probably told me 3 different times how amazed he was and how flavorful it was...\"yes babe I heard you\" ha but I agree it was pretty delish. I got the build your own Mac which has 5 different cheeses and added their charred garlic broccoli. OMG!..not an option listed on the menu but leave it to me to order stuff that doesn't exist and wa la! Amazing concoction that I highly recommend....I ordered Malbec to take the edge off a rough day and couldn't be happier with what I ordered, comfort food at its finest on a nice rainy evening Come check it out and say hi to Nicole who was our server",

I came back recently with a group of 8, and we were seated immediately. I tried the walleye fish and chips, and it was the best I've had in a long time.   Everyone else's food was good, too. I gave my wife's One pound burrito a try (only served for brunch Sat and Sun). I've had a hard time finding a breakfast burrito I enjoy, and this is one of the best I've ever had!   Today, I ordered the burger, and I wish I would've got the burrito. I would give the burger 3 stars, but I'm still going with a 5 star rating, overall. Heck, A Perfect Circle was playing when I went to the clean, spacious bathroom. The Kaiju double IPA was pretty good, as well. Not crazy about the caramel malts, but the hop profile is solid.",

A young woman named Anna answered, and was as nice as could be as I explained we'd be there in about 5 minutes, and that we were a group of 4 adults and a baby. When we walked in another team member greeted us, but was aware of our group, and we were immediately escorted to our table! Every aspect of our experience was fantastic. We were made totally welcome with our 4-old baby, and from beginning til end everything we needed, wanted or may require was on the table! I enjoyed the BBQ Pork Sammie, my wife LOVED the Veggie Burger, and my parents shared a couple items on top of the fresh chips and ranch dressing we had as a starter. I am happy the original idea for lunch fell thru, as Scottsdale Beer Company was a Standing Ovation for all! Thanks!",

    "text": "Had a late lunch here today and the place only had 3 diners during this time period. The restaurant has a great local neighborhood feeling and we were glad we got there before Happy Hour started.  The menu isn't big and overwhelming, it's just right and our very nice server Liz gave us a great rundown of every menu item. She highly recommended the street tacos but we were craving chicken wings and sliders and that's what we ordered.   So we ordered the Cowboy sliders (3 beef sliders) with fries and the Triple Cooked Chicken Wings with BBQ sauce. All the food came out at once as we were sharing the plates family style.  The wings looked fresh and the BBQ sauce was evenly spread, the sliders looked dry and didn't look like anything special. The wings were tripled cooked meaning they were fried, grilled and sauced. We had never heard of this and were convinced this would be the dish that could of been an epic fail. It turned out to be just the opposite.  OMG, we had yet discovered a wings place and this order was amazing. It was a healthy amount of wings to share, had a nice ranch dressing on the side and a small portion of carrots and celery. The taste of the wings were incredible. The dish was served hot and with just enough BBQ sauce on the wings. These wings were finger licking good. We could of devoured 2 orders if we were here to hang out and watch some games. One word...YUM  As far as the sliders were concerned, this totally missed the mark. As I suspected they looked dry and had no taste to them even though they had a little piece of cheese and some baby onion rings on the sliders. One word...PASS on this.  We probably should of had the street tacos...next time  Overall server was polite, the bathrooms and restaurant were clean and for a meal under $30 it was worth the drive out from Fountain Hills to try a new place. We will def be back.",

Both were really good.   My sis ordered her flight and I went with a Margarita.  Then we decided on the 1/2 Mac & Cheese with Chile verde, chicken, fries and the asada nachos.  I enjoyed my Mac & cheese.  My sis liked her chicken strips and fries. But, The Hubby's nachos fell short of flavor and MEAT!!! I mean it almost had NO MEAT. It was that bad, I had to mention it to our server. I mean we paid $3-4 extra for it. Pretty bad.   The service & food were prompt our margaritas, beer and appetizers were very good.",

From day one the beer has been amazing! So much so that I have taken to enjoying their samplers in a way not experienced since visiting pubs in England!   For the past 2 months the food has matured from English comfort food to a fusion of English standards with Asian and middle eastern flair! The new chef Justin is a keeper! Same level of pride in crafting food as the brewmaster has in crafting beers!   This weekend the special was lamb Kofta Kabab and Blackend Okra with beets and a sriracha-mayo dipping sauce. Awesome!!!! And as my friend. From Birmingham said best lamb in Arizona! Please make it a permanent addition to the menu!",

First off, charging for dressing like ranch or ketchup or bbq sauce is unacceptable but to not be told PRIOR about the charge is even more unacceptable. All other establishments do not typically charge for ranch dressing therefore good customer service would be to let your patrons know when they ask for it that it is at an extra cost so the patron can make the choice.

The Brussels sprouts side dish was quite good, though it was advertised with bacon and we never did see or taste any bacon.  The tater tots were also fine.  We had a pulled pork sandwich, a $9 price at Happy Hour.  It was good, but dry somewhat as it had very little BBQ sauce.  We asked for some BBQ sauce.  The bartender went to the cash register and keyed it in.  We had assumed BBQ sauce was going to be in a jar or squeeze bottle, like everywhere else.  Not here.  The bartender walked back tot he kitchen and brought us a small cup of heated BBQ sauce.  On our bill we saw we were charged 50 cents for the sauce.  That was a joke.  Why not charge for ketchup if people order french fries?  Nickel and diming customers is not the way to build loyalty, or even keep them happy.    IF we ever go there again, we will bring our own condiments.  Hopefully, Scottsdale Beer Company will not charge us for bringing them in.",

    "text": "Love this place!  Actually went in before they were officially open.  I didn't know that, but upon entering, I was told that it was a private pre-opening event, YET they still invited me in, and gave me a free beer to try.  And even had a chance to chat with the owner, Douglas.  Once I told him I was an IPA fan, he gave me a sample of their triple IPA, (from the back).  Keep in mind, that I wasn't even supposed to be there.  So, on top of being very welcoming, the beer is GREAT!.    Went in a few days later with the misses, and enjoyed a great beer and pretzels.  Again, very good and tasty.  I just love the layout, the beer, and they type of food on the menu is my type of food.  I expect to be back often the try the rest of the menu, and based on my initial experience, this is a great addition to the craft beer scene, and its in a super location.  An another plus for the female side, yes they have a few TV's, but they are not trying to be a sports bar, so you will not get overwhelmed with the sights and sounds of dozens of TV's.  So if you looking for a good locals hangout, with good craft beer and food, this is the place.",

    "text": "First and last visit for my friend and I on Saturday. We called ahead to find out if they would be airing the Kentucky Derby, which they were. We were greeted by an unfriendly hostess who did not make us feel welcome at all. We originally were going to sit at the bar, but there were only a couple spots available that had a clear view of the TVs airing the race. Odd set up with the TVs throughout the restaurant actually. When we found a table right next to the bar and made a move to sit down, we were immediately and rudely approached by a server who rushed over to tell us that if we needed to be seated we would need to go back to the hostess. I would totally understand if the place was crowded but there was an abundance of open seating and this was a bar table, not one of the dining spaces. The hostess then told us the table we had hoped to sit at was reserved for larger parties (it seated 6) and we could not sit there. Ok, I get it, but again, lots of open seating, including several tables that could seat 6 or more. So we were seated at a  table for 4 instead. Now, when I walk into a bar that has probably 20-30 TVs tuned into sporting events,  my assumption is that they know their customers are going to want to be able to watch and hear the events. The sound was on for the Kentucky Derby race itself, but then was abruptly cut off right when the race ended, before the commentators even announced the full results. When we asked our server about this, he told us that \"they try to stay away from the sports stuff\" and had to switch back to playing music. Really?  On top of this, service was slow, orders were not taken properly, and the environment was just overall a real disappointment. Would not recommend and will not be returning.",

We have taken large groups there on many occasions and always when people come visit us from out of town. We love the servers and the food. The last time we were there, we advised our server {a new one we had not had before} that I am DEATHLY allergic to shell fish and to make sure my food was not in contact with anything shell. He told us he could not guarantee that. We explained that we had been there many times and that was never a problem in the past and that we have never had anyone tell us that was not a possibility both there and the other many places we eat. The Owner, Tom, came to our table and told us they would not guarantee that my food would not get in contact with their shell fish dishes. We were there with a party of eight from California. Needless to say, neither my wife nor I ordered food. We paid for the rest of the group after the meal and left - never to return! I am retiring this month and had every intention to have my retirement party at SBC. They have lost not only our business but the business we bring with lots of friends and family. BEWARE if you plan to eat here if you have a shell fish allergy!!",

Their stout and hefeweizen were below par in my opinion. An important note that on multiple of the small glasses of beer there were visible lip marks from previous people. Yuck! My wife got some water and it reeked like a pool there was so much chlorine in it. We asked and they said they triple filter their water for their beer, so why not carry over to water and fountain drinks? The food was, well, bar food. It wasn't anything fancy. I had the burger and fries and my wife had the fish and chips. For the quality of food and drinks it was WAY over-priced. Wish we weren't so disappointed with our visit.",

Then was ignored completely the rest of the time. While people on both sides of me sat down after, was asked for drink and food orders, received food n drink orders, and enjoyed food and drink orders. All while still no one acknowledging me and asking if I would like to even place an order or if I had any questions! Seriously disappointed!! It's already not easy going out and dining alone, but then being ignored just makes it worse!! I wanted to order the quinoa chopped salad and a few glasses of wine. At least the bartender got a $1 from me for my glass of water. What she had against me, I do not know. But it wasn't personal, because there were 2 bartenders , and they both ignored me!!! Not going again.. Which is sad, because I take yoga right next door, and am there all the time. Just don't go alone I guess!!",

    "text": "Went here on a Friday afternoon for happy hour. The parking is a little weird, just a few spots near the doors, the rest are behind the building by Pier One...maybe they want to see if you can walk afterwards. The waiter was a little rushed, barely waiting for us to order. Maybe he had too many tables? We tried their Amber Ale and the Bandito Brown Ale. The Amber was a little hoppy for me so I joined my husband with the Bandito. It was a rich, satisfying brown ale, 6.2ABV 30 ibu, so NOT hoppy, yay for us!! They have an extensive list of their own brews, most seemed to be IPA's or variations of them. They also have a full bar and wine menu. Our pints were $4.50 but $3.50 during happy hour, 3-7 weekdays and 11-4 Saturdays. They also had $1 off all appetizers. We tried the smothered fries and fried pickles. The fries were good but the gravy wasn't as rich as the one at North Mountain Brewing. You could add bangers for an extra cost (not sure about sausage with brown gravy though!) I really liked the fried pickles. They were more like pickle chips, thin battered deep fried slices with a great cucumber ranch dip. The place got a little noisy toward the end of our visit, happy hour in full swing! There were several groups with young children, too. The waiter seemed to have a little more time for us at that point and helpfully explained that getting a growler fill on Tuesdays was 1/2 price. Wow, that's a deal!! We will be back, cuz they serve fish and chips, and I have a friend who puts that number one on her microbrew list!",

    "text": "We checked this place out. Nice decoration, liked having booth right by window where can see their brewery, good atmosphere, even liked the music on the speakers (some good old school 80s music at the time). Felt very spacious, whereas some places, cram you in. It was also incredibly clean and no bad smells, nor flies, or anything distracting like that. We found it to be quite comfortable there and laid back (in a good way).  The server and staff were really great, friendly, and quite helpful. Needed a bit of help deciding from their giant beer menu, and our server had some suggestions. They had all sorts of variety.   Got a good belgian blonde ale they had on special and on tap. Man, that was a great beer, good enough that itself alone would be a great reason to go back. Too bad I didn't remember which one (because I'd probably go buy it in the store instead). But it worked great.  Gave the fried pickle chips a whirl. Not my thing, but I found them tasty, juicy, crunchy. The breading was perfect. Not soggy and damp, but had a nice crisp. One bite and you feel the juices unleash. Went perfect with the type of beer we were having (don't think it would mix well with anything dark unless that's one's own preference). She liked it a lot though, since coming from eastern Europe, she grew up developing a taste and sense for pickle products, so if it won her over, that's a great sign.  We ordered burgers. I'm not a fan of fancy burgers. They didn't use \"normal\" tomatoes, but was some kind of ripe, deflated, real tart, roma tomato. In simpler terms, it tasted like someone took some ketchup and reformed it back into a tomato. Was quite \"ketchupy\" in taste, but you can tell they did a lot more to it. Not a bad twist (not sure if it was intentional). Takes getting used to and looks horrible (like it was a small red alien that got run over). Some people have a real thing for these, but I couldn't get used to it and ended up just taking it off. No lettuce but some kind of kale or red-stemmed leafy alien plant (can't remember too clearly), didn't care about it. There was a sauce, I asked for it on the side. It was some kind of aoli tartar sauce or like that. WHO PUTS THAT ON A HAMBURGER? Well, they did, and while she loved everything on it, I didn't (as I pointed out). Good thing I asked for it on the side.  BUT the beef was very, very good, juicy, thick, tasty, it began to fill us up fast. Great char on that patty, nicely seasoned. The cheese melted well and worked great with the flavor of the patty and the BACON.  I love it when a place GETS BACON RIGHT. THEY GOT IT RIGHT. About 85% of any place I go to, they serve undercooked bacon or skimp on the bacon. I won't name their names here, but suffice to say, there is simply no friggin' excuse for undercooked bacon, or skimping on the bacon. Bacon should be generous and cooked crispy but not too dry (hence, some grease on it).  At this place, I'm proud to say, I got some good bacon, the portions were right, the pieces were huge, and they were very thick, and not undercooked. THANK YOU.  They also got the french fries right. I didn't get pile of undercooked or anything that tasted like it was in a freezer for years. They were crisp, delicious, and I was very impressed with the portion size.   Everything was well worth the price, given the high quality.  We had a very enjoyable experience there and recommend it.",

Had the Elevation Arete, but they also had Avery double IPA, Santa's Little Helper, one from Lost Abbey and several others.  Go here.",

Next time and there will be a next time, we will share an onion soup and a walleye platter. If you trout lovers want to try a great tasting fish, get over to the Scottsdale Beer Company. I sampled a couple of their low hops beers and all of them were to \"hoppy\" for my taste. Had to ask that the music be turned down.  When will restaurants learn that customers go out for food not loud can't be heard over the music?",

I had the SW Turkey Salad which was very unusual with chayote squash (sliced very thinly--beautiful!), freeze dried corn, black beans, sun flower seeds, and a bit of avocado and red onion.  There was (at most) one ounce of shaved deli turkey. It was really good, but a little pricey for the amount of protein.  My friend got the chicken wings appetizer, and her husband got the bison burger which looked really good.  He also had a couple of different brews.  I liked the atmosphere--not too loud either.  My friends and I hadn't seen each other for over five years, so we spent a long time there catching up.  The waiter was cool with that which I appreciated.

    "text": "So my fiance doesn't drink and I very rarely drink beer (card-carrying member of the wino club here), so while we've thrown around the idea of heading to SBC for dinner for a while now, we just never got around to it.  Well, 2016 has started off as a special sort of dumpster fire and on Saturday we found ourselves NEEDING to get out of the house after being cooped up in there with about 20 fans blowing on our carpet/baseboards to counteract our water heater flooding all over the place. That's neither here nor there (and I'm sure I'll write some strongly worded Yelps regarding a few contractors...) and we found ourselves STARVING this past Saturday evening. It's just down the street, so why not? We headed down and snagged a table on the twinkle-light-adorned patio and perused the menu.  One thing I'm apt to order about 99% of the time if it's on any menu is any sort of soft pretzels/cheese/mustard situation. We decided on those as an app and they arrived to our table HOT. Awesome! The beer cheese had a very tasty and nuanced beer undertone, and the mustard was grainy and perfectly spicy.   I decided to keep my meal in the theme of health and went for a \"small\" (generous for most non-giants) portion of mac and cheese and a side salad. The mac was a cheesy mess topped with toasty Panko. It was comfort food times a million. My side salad came with, honestly? One of the best Italian dressings I've ever had. I'm stupidly picky about salad dressing and don't love most, but this was herby and dreamy. Fiance went with their special of BBQ chicken drumsticks, potato salad (the mustardy kind), baked beans and a buttermilk roll. He wasn't expecting to find some of the best BBQ chicken he'd ever had at Scottsdale Beer Company, but he did and the few bites I snagged were life-affirming. And the buttermilk roll? Get out of here. This is unfortunately a special and not on their regular menu, but if you see this dish on their specials list...GET IT.   I did decide to peruse their drink menu and got some sort of seasonal pomegranate cider. This was the perfect balance of tart (not too sweet at all!) and refreshing. All in all, SBC has shot itself up to one of our favorite spots in just one trip. Bravo!",

The thing about beer is you can't say it's good or bad, it's up to the individuals taste.  So in other words, order a cold one!!  Had a burger and the only thing I wish is that is was grilled over flames compared to flat oven.  Not complaining but the bun does get soggy from the juices in the meat since you don't have that sear.  Mandy had the fish and chips and kudos for having Walleye as the fish.  Not to heavy breaking and quite delicious fries.  So instead of going with Bud, make the trip to try their brew.",

Service was excellent and always seems to be people there throughout the day with a great outdoor patio feel since they have huge roll up doors.",

I had been here before, but had not noticed that they had a beet salad.  The review seemed very positive.  I'm so glad I tried it.  Most beet salads are actually quiet small. This salad definitely left me full.  The salad had red beets, pistachio nuts, mandarin orange slices, goat cheese and arugula. I wished it had the orange beets, but still amazing!!",

    "text": "Normally I'm pretty lenient on service. Doesn't take too much to satisfy that aspect of my dining experience. Fill my water, bring my check in a timely fashion, bring me the food I ordered. Pretty simple. This was some of the worst service me and my family have ever experienced. My water was not filled, I had to ask for it to be filled twice. And I only drank two glasses mind you. The order was not correct and our empty plates were left on the table for 15 minutes with the server not checking on us once. We had to resort to getting up and going to the bar to ask for our check after 20 minutes of being done and watching him dilly dally around the restaurant. When he finally came to bring me the check, he asked if we were finished, never apologized and then walked away mumbling have a nice night. Again, I am no service maniac, and I  enjoy good food and never want to write a bad review. But this was so bad I had to point it out. I must add for fairness, my bison burger was delicious and the kids burgers as well as my wife's were very very good. If you're looking for a complete experience, do not go here. If you are looking for good food but terrible service, here will be fine.",

The inside is well lit with a lot of natural light and there are a lot of TVs so you can watch a game from anywhere. The outside patio area has a good number of tables, and the parking lot/shopping mall it's next too wasn't too busy while we ate on Saturday at lunch.  The menu and food really stands out. My husband got the shepherds pie, which was gigantic and so good. I got the beet salad, which was so fresh, flavorful, and high quality. It wasn't big enough to make a meal of, but that's the only complaint.   Definitely recommend this spot, even if you only want food and aren't drinking.",

I wanted something lighter than a burger so I went with the turkey wrap! Not too shabby! The wrap was a good size and had decent flavor. I substituted the regular fries/chips for sweet potato fries which were really tasty!   Unfortunately I can't comment on the beer since I don't drink and drive when I am driving my daughter.   As a group we shared the Brewer's Board and it was just okay. Each component is good. We love the mustard, jam, and corn nuts. But there isn't enough bread or meat to spread the condiments on. But it's a good size board for 4 people sharing.   Overall it's a good place to eat, a nice place for a date, and if you're looking for a nice lunch or dinner on the way home it's a good stop in!",

We were able to choose beers we enjoyed and they made a decent Arnold Palmer for my dad.   My mom and hubby each got the walleye fish & chips (is why we went there in the first place-- as a native Minnesotan, my mom is always looking for walleye in the southwest and doesn't usually find it). They both enjoyed their meals and we even saved some of the beer cheese leftover from the pretzel to dip fries in: heavenly. I got the tinga tostadas (no devil's parsley, but added avocado) and they were fantastic. The chef put the sauce on the side (a jalapeno cream sauce, I think?) because it had cilantro in it, so because I asked for no cilantro he put the sauce on the side because it also contained cilantro and he thought maybe I had an allergy. He brought my dish to me personally to explain his rationale. That's nice service! I don't usually mind cilantro in sauces and I'm not allergic (it's just that godawful handful of it that people often throw on top of perfectly tasty dishes that I cannot abide), and I did like the sauce so it would have been fine, but I still appreciated the personal service.   I look forward to my next visit to Scottsdale to return to this place! I would love to drink more beers and try more menu items.",

I love the rotating beer selections and fact that you can count on new ciders or sours instead of just IPAs or ales and their brussel sprouts can't be beat. Service is always good, even on busy sports nights (with the big screens this place is a superb sports bar, but I cringe saying that because it's nicer than Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers or someplace like that), and I like that the kids meal comes with a side salad or fruit as opposed to just fries. The otter pops on the way out are a special treat too! And cheers for putting the wifi pw on the menu! It's the little things.....;)",

    "text": "Two words --- TACO MONDAY'S! I've been a huge fan of this place recently, especially after discovering they have a taco Monday deal. So here it is, a pair of tacos (pork, chicken, fish, carne asada) for $4.00! The tacos are SO delicious and the toppings on them are unique and interesting. Chicken comes with a dry slaw and honey roasted peanut topping, pork comes with a mandarin orange, and the carne asada is bomb also. I'm not sure about the fish cause I'm just not a sea food person.   Besides the tacos, the rest of the menu is also amazing. One of our friends strayed away from the Taco Monday tradition and got a fully loaded Mac and Cheese with an EGG on it and it was absolutely bomb! I posted a picture but seriously... I wanted one too! The whole menu is wholesome, delicious, and I don't think I've ever seen anything on it that didn't have my mouth watering.   Now, about the beer though, Scottsdale Beer Company has a great beer selection to choose from including their own beers, the typical beers, and beers from other local breweries. I'm all about local Arizona brews and this place has them to offer and pair with your meal choice.   The restaurant is also clean and a nice. Once inside you meet the hostess. There are plenty of booths and high tops to choose from along with a large bar centered in the middle with plenty of chairs. With nicer weather you can also enjoy a seat on the patio to soak up the sun!  (Full disclosure: these photos really don't do the food justice - you gotta try it for yourself!)",

Thankfully, the restaurant we had considered was closed for construction, so we dropped the kids off at the local YMCA down the street for Parent's Night Out ($40 total + dinner for 4 hours. Yasss.) and headed there. We arrived with a packed parking lot and a bit of a wait, but then we nearly closed the place down just sitting, eating and drinking with some awesome friends.  We started with beers in the bar... which led to beers and appetizers of fried cheese curds (omgomgomg) and a pretzel.   Dinner was equally amazing. I had the housemade veggie burger-- vegetarians be aware! This is legit and it was super delish. I am actually dreaming about it right now. The fries were awesome as well.   A few more beers later and the food and the conversation and perfection literally has me wanting to go back right now.  For those with kids, they have kid Wednesdays where kids eat free and pizza cookies are $5. I cannot confirm about the deliciousness of the pizza cookie, but I will definitely keep you posted.",

Fortunately, we were able to grab a booth without much of a wait. Our waiter was quick to bring water and discuss the menu. During HH, several appetizers are discounted, as well as beer/wine/well drinks. I ordered a gin and tonic and my husband ordered a rum and ginger beer. For well drinks, they were good. For our meal, we ordered three appetizers. We ordered the fried pickles, the fried green tomatoes, and the smothered fries. The fried pickles were really good! They were thin like chips and came with a cucumber ranch sauce. I would order these again. The fried green tomatoes were just okay. They were good but the breading was very thick and kept falling off the delicate tomato. If they changed the breading, using the breading they used on the fried pickles, then I'd order again. The pimento cheese sauce that came with the tomatoes was really good and I even dipped some of the fried pickles in it. The smothered fries where basically poutine. These were delicious. The gravy was thick with and nicely covered the fries. The cheese curds on top slowly melted into the gravy as we devoured the dish. No meat in the gravy but you could order sausage in addition. For dessert, we ordered the milk and cookies. YUM! The milk part was an adult milkshake - some coffee liquor in vanilla ice cream. I loved it and would order another one of these. The cookies were warm but nothing special. Overall, it was a fun HH spot and I'd come here again.",

I'm no beer snob, so I can only attest that it tastes good and that my friends have no complaints. I typically get the Puppybird  or the Imperial Stout if I do get beer.   Now the food. I have yet to be let down. We have tried and loved the following: Wings (I am a wing snob, and these are amazing - I got the spicy, friend got the BBQ - both great), Mac N Cheese (Truffled Parmesan Crust - need I say more... ), Roasted Cauliflower with pork belly cracklin', Burger (cheese curds), Smothered Fries (topped with Pork Belly), and then the fried pickles. I do believe they have salads too.   Service has been a hoot. Always friendly and great personalities. Specifically Kersten and Brian (bartenders) - but everyone has been pretty great.   Plenty of Tv's. Open patio. USB ports on the outlets that are under the bar - genius!! My phone died and I happened to have the USB cord, but not the power adapter - first time I've seen a usb port available for customer use like this!    My only quarrel, if I could have one - is that there is only one dessert on the menu (and there are otter pops in the cooler by the door!). However, I do not come here for dessert and the name is 'Scottsdale BEER Company' so it's not really a valid expectation!",

If you're a craft beer enthusiast and you happen to be in the Scottsdale area check this place out. Ask for the top flight selection because that will give you a chance to experience the whole variety of beers. Pick one and you won't go wrong!

Not the most exciting location or view, but conveniently located off the 101. What stood out to me was the different style of beers they offer. Off the map kind of brews! A Scottish IPA, A triple IPA, Milk stout, a strong Belgian, and an unfiltered IPA were all on tap, along with many more. Very diverse and tempting list but unfortunately I couldn't try them all! The few I had (unfiltered, Scottish, Hefe) were all well done. Next time I will venture into the food menu and try a few others. I saw and tasted enough to want to come back and maybe push the review to 5 starts depending on the food.",

The waiters allow you to sample to beers before they pour and that makes a big difference.  For starters the local warm pub pretzel is our go-to, it is so good but can run on the salty side.    For a salad I adore the Prosciutto and Melon salad it sounds strange but it is the right mix of sweet and salty.  I prefer a different dressing instead of getting the honey-balsamic which isn't my favorite go for the herb ranch.  Their dressing is made in house and is divine.",

The dipping sauce they come with is absolutely fantastic, and you can tell everything is hot from the kitchen and really fresh. It'd been a while since I'd been back here so I was delighted to see that they still had the same quality service and friendly staff. Great location, and offers an authentic taste of Scottsdale's legendary dining scene. The only downside was the burger, I don't know if it was olive oil or what, but the entire thing was absolutely smothered in grease. You couldn't even touch the bottom bun without your hands coming up slimy, and there was a pool of it underneath the meal. It tasted kind of mediocre and bland, and I just wish it was easier to eat.",

I still enjoyed the sandwich because of the quality of the meat, but this sandwich could be taken to the next level with more seasonings.

For the toppings, I picked and chose what would fit my diet and the staff were more than accommodating! The beer is on point with 21 taps with 17 brewed by SBC.

I ordered the Downshift Session IPA. It was delicious! It was everything an IPA should be in my opinion.  For food, we ordered a devil egg dip to start. I believe this was a special for the day.  An egg dip isn't something I would normally order, but I ended up really like it! It was the perfect amount of spicy and very flavorful.  For my meal, I got my burger, of course. I don't think I even glanced at anything else on the menu.    The burger comes with cheese curds (yum!), bacon, tomatoes, bibb lettuce, and topped with aioli.  It was huge; I couldn't finish it all, which is very rare for me. I'm a dedicated member of the clean plate club. The fries were also amazing!",

    "text": "This place isn't far for my parents house, so we've been a bunch of times! There are a few things I'd totally recommend: the nachos, the Brussels sprouts, and the nachos.   Went here the other night for a quick bite and shared the Brussels and nachos with my mom. My dad and hubby both got the fish and chips (so I can stand by my statement of 3 favorites).   The Brussels are covered in a delicious tangy sauce, crispy, and then doused in peanuts! Crunchy semi-healthy goodness!   The nachos are great with their shredded chicken! The avocado cream is awesome on top.   The fish and chips are some of my family's favorite.   Overall, they've got the beer and the food happening here!!  The only reason for the 4 star is the servers are always nice, but the service can be a little spotty. We waited over a half an hour to be checked on after our meal arrived and had to flag someone else down to help us; and then an additional 30 after asking for our bill. It wasn't very busy, maybe 3-4 other tables were full, and adequate staff was there, our server was just a little MIA.",

The meat loaf was well seasoned and flavorful. The gravy peas and mashed potatoes were also delicious.  Coop our server said the fried rice entree was very unique so I ordered that as my main dish. If western cowboys cooked fried rice out in the range from the chuck wagon over a fire this is exactly how it would taste ! It was delicious with big chunks of pork,egg, peas,  and rice, and had a delicious and spicy sauce that gave it a moderate amount of heat.  The service was prompt and helpful.  I will be back.",

I appreciate the effort on the smoke, but you HAVE TO drop the wings in the fryer to crisp up the skin.  The sauce was not spicy either.  I would have preferred a traditional buffalo sauce like Franks.  The fish and chips were ok.  No lemon with them.  The fries were soggy/soft.  The beer was OK.  About as good as Four Peaks.  The service was good.  I am always amazed at these Scottsdale bars/breweries that have nothing to do but stare at a TV.  Pool tables, shuffle board, darts would be nice... We actually cashed out and went to Fate for a pizza cuz we didn't finish the food at SBC.  We may try it again.  Maybe not....",

My buddy had the angus burger and said one of the best burgers he has had. This buddy has been part one of Arizonas all time restaurant groups for years. I tried the porter and stout. The stout was good but the porter was just ok. Again, the food is top top notch. A must go.",

When Uber dropped us off,  we noted at least 20 people waiting outside for a table.  The hostess was friendly and provided a 30 minute estimated wait time.  We weren't deterred, but it did take a long time to get a beer to enjoy while we awaited seating.  Perhaps it was just timing, but the bar staff were in the weeds until well after Happy Hour was over.  A very nice couple offered us their spots at the bar and we ordered the SBC version of Poutine.  It was a little salty, but still quite good.  My hubby and I split a Schnitzel Chicken sandwich which I would order again in a heartbeat.  We absolutely did not care for the Mac N Cheese, which tasted like pickle juice was added??  Some of the beers on the website/menu were not available, but the 48 State IPA was a pleasant pint.  We were nearly done with our dinner when the \"buzzer\" went off to seat us at a table - 55 minutes later.  The staff really can't control the turnover for tables, but hopefully they will get their Friday night routine down soon.  Good Experience & we will be happy to return to Scottsdale Beer Company.",

The food is unbelievable creativly good..  We've tried homemade Tots, Walleye fish and chips, mac and cheese, smothered fries, angus hamburger, meatloaf, and brusselsprouts.  The only thing I didn't rave about was the onion soap- a little to strong on the beer, and week on the cheese.  We keep coming back for more.  Why not 6 stars??  One of the bartenders.  The tall girl who may run the bar is not unfriendly but doesn't show genuine concern for the customer.  Fake smile and just wants to move on to the next order.  My wife want's to avoid her.  The very best bartender is Sam who also waits tables.  Incredible personality and really is proud of where she works and knows  the food and beer.  She takes time to explain and is genuine.  We look for her when we come in. When Sam works the bar she keeps her head up looking to serve, while the  others keep their head down unless you ask for help.  Food is delivered supper fast, so the kitchen has incredibly organized.   I asked the hostess table for the manager as I wanted to rave about the food and beer.  They said they'd send him right over but didn't happen.  The manager is on top of things as my burger had toppings that I didn't request and he came over to apologize and made it right.  Great guy, but the head bartender needs to keep her eyes up even with busy and be genuine.  She is the weak link even though she's fast delivering drinks.",

Oh my gosh, that was the best mac and cheese I've ever had.  Between four of us we were unable to finish, but every bite was heaven.  We also had the chocolate texas tea cake and peach cobbler for dessert.  Our servers were SUPER friendly and made the experience that much better.  They are genuinely nice, good people.  The environment is very relaxed.  It wasn't too busy on a Sunday night but I imagine when it is busy it still isn't overwhelming.

The happy hour just names what is half off so it just said 'brussel sprouts\" with no description of what was in it. At a quick glance we opened the full menu to see it said brussell sprouts with a 'V' next to it (which they explain at the top of the menu is VEGETARIAN) and ordered it. We were eating it than I got to the middle and say chopped bacon. We told the waitress we thought these were vegetarian and she smiled and laughed and said no. As I explained my husband is vegetarian for religious purposes and we are shocked to find meat in these vegetables, she just laughed again and said nope they are not vegetarian sorry. We were disgusted and didnt say much after that. I said I wanted the bill and she charged us for it. My husband said politely, we are not going to pay for the appetizer and she looked dumb founded as to why not. She said she had to speak to her manager about that. She came back and said they took it off. Im happy they took off the appetizer but really disappointed that she didnt take the matter seriously...at all. We are really nice people but im afraid if it were anyone else who was vegetarian for religious beliefs and they ate something off the menu that is claimed to be vegetarian and it is NOT, this restaurant could have a major lawsuit on their hands. My suggestion to this company is to change your menu so it is clear and concise before you get in serious trouble.  I have posted the menu and if you see brussell sprouts it has a red \"V\" next to it, now on the very top right of that menu and can see it says V means VEGETARIAN, NOT, modified to be vegetarian.",

Terry, one of the bartenders, did a great job to make sure that my mother had a great experience while she is in town.  I am also convinced the brewer, Brad, adds hops and dreams to create the magical beer served here. Couple that with melt in your mouth tacos offered on the wonderful TACO MONDAY there is no better way to start your week than at SBC!",

I had the BEST ham n cheese sammy I've ever had the pleasure to consume.  In house smoked ham, a fried cheese disc adorned the delicious offering. Fried egg also on top Great poutine!",

I asked for their cucumber ranch that normally comes with one of their appetizers and it paired perfectly with their fries.   This place has a lot of TVs so it would be great for game nights.

    "text": "Being a beer geek, the recent boom of craft beer breweries in this area has been a thing of beauty. I have been worried the quality would diminish yet with Scottsdale Beer Company, they are a great addition.  Came here with out of town relatives who also enjoy a tasty pint. We brought 3 kids under 7 with us and we all had a great lunch. When we arrived, we were sat immediately although it was quite busy. We also had immediate service which was great since the adults were quite parched.  We began w/the fried pickle app and the hummus. Our whole party, including the youngsters, loved the fried pickles. The hummus was good ye the pickles stole the show.  Those of age each ordered a different beer from their in-house brewery. The Hefewiezen, in my humble opinion, was one of best Heffies I'v had in a long time! HInt of bubble gum aroma with great drink-ability. Tasted like more and really make you realize how deplorable Blue Moon is.  The Scottish ale and their DIPA was equally fantastic although I thought the DIPA needed a bigger hop kick.  For lunch, I had their lettuce wrap dish which was good yet I would order the dressing on the side next time. Had enough dressing for two dishes. The kiddos each had mac and cheese which is provided by Kraft.   As indicated, the service was very attentive and the beer/food arrived quickly, which is the only way for beer to get to a table.  Can't wait to come back and would love to sit outside next time before it's oven weather.",

Nice modern and clean atmosphere with a large, prominent bar that serves up their own crafted beers along with a few guest taps.  Thankfully the menu is diverse (compared to other nearby breweries) with distinct upper scale pub fare that is delicious and pairs perfectly with craft beer.  Some in our group really appreciated the vegetarian options.  Our service was very attentive and pleasant.  House beer choices were limited, but they will have more in the next week or so.  I wish they had more information on the house beers available, perhaps a small printed beer menu with house beer descriptions and such.  I know it is a geeky request but this is a beer focused establishment.  Perhaps those blank chalkboards would be ideal, especially if they included which beers are \"on deck\".    Loved my experience here and will be back soon.",

    "text": "A very welcome addition to Central Scottsdale, Scottsdale Beer Company so far has proven to be awesome!  I've been there twice since their soft opening on January 3, and I must say I am very impressed.  To put it this way, with independent restaurants that have no existing brand or footprint to have as support, it is up to the owner/developer to create something that works, and that won't fall victim to the statistic of the ever-so-prevalent failed restaurants/bars.    I think the owners/developers of Scottsdale Beer Company have it right, and I wish them much success.    When trying out new restaurants over the years, I can tell that sometimes it takes a good amount of time for many places to smooth out the wrinkles and overcome the glitches that can inevitably happen with a new operation.  Well, after these two visits, my experience was absolutely stellar from start to finish.  I have no criticism whatsoever!   Overall, I found Scottsdale Beer Company to...  ...have excellent, attentive service from every employee encountered.  And it wasn't just solid service - everyone went above and beyond to see that the food, drinks, and overall experience was top notch.  You could tell that not only did they hire the right people, that they must have been well-trained to really care about their customers.  ...have very tasty food!  The fish and chips were amazing, the blackened fish sandwich scrumptious, and the desserts very good.  My friends seemed to really enjoy their selections too.  Extra points for very nice presentation too, with nice dinnerware, etc.  ...good beer!  Granted, their brewery is not at full speed ahead yet, but their guest beers were really nice choices for all tastes.  In most bars around the area, it seems IPAs predominate the \"craft beer\" taps.  Nothing against IPAs, but they are not my personal favorites.  I tend to gravitate toward Belgian-style beers, porters, stouts, bocks, etc.  In their guest beer list (which changes daily), they had a really nice Belgian quad and Russian imperial porter, both of which were top notch.  ...a really nice atmosphere.  It is apparent from all the TVs throughout, that this would be a great place to watch a game.  Additionally, even if it were packed, there is enough spaced to where it wouldn't feel crowded.  The decor has clean lines and feels urban and industrial, which I like.  There was even an artist there chalking up nice designs on their really large chalkboards.  Nice music in the background, but just at the right volume to where everyone can still hear each other.  On nice 75 degree days like today, I would guess the \"garage door\" style windows they had lining one wall to the outdoor patio could really make the place have an amazing open, airy feel to take advantage of the great Scottsdale weather.  ...was impeccably clean.  Granted, it is brand new, but sometimes that doesn't mean anything to some restaurants.  The bathrooms were super clean, as well as everywhere else.  Bottom line, it is not only apparent that the owners here seem to really care about hopefully turning this place into a cash cow success, but they also really seem to care about delivering a fantastic experience to their patrons on all levels (which is the key to that cash cow success!).  I hope that they can keep consistency, and that many subsequent reviews from other Yelpers can exclaim about a great time as well!  Best wishes to Scottsdale Beer Company.  I look forward to returning!",

    "text": "Been here twice now; first when they just opened and again a few weeks ago. Both times I had a great experience with this place. I have been to a lot of breweries in Arizona and they are usually all one of two types: Taproom/Bar or Restaurant, Scottsdale Beer Co is much much more focused on the restaurant, it is much more of a restaurant where you would go for lunch or dinner. It has kind of a Yardhouse like vibe to it, so not overly \"Scottsdale\" by any means. All the food I've had so far has been awesome, particularly the Mac N Cheese with truffle, and you get a giant bowl of it too!  But don't get me wrong, the beers are great too, but like a lot of newer breweries, I think they are focusing on a constantly revolving tap selection rather then having flagship mainstay beers (of the three beers I've had of theirs, none are currently on tap now). This is both good and bad.  Good because you get a variety and if one day you don't like the styles, in a few weeks the selection will be different and you can find your style. The bad tho is if you find your favorite, it may not be there when you come back.  So overall, I don't think this will be a regular hangout spot, but it is definitely on my list of places to check out with family, friends or looking for a casual dinner night out.",

    "text": "I went to this brewery on Wednesday 2/4, and these are my thoughts.  As soon as you walk in, you get a cool sense of warehousey and industrial, which I liked. The bar is a wrap around bar and has ample seating. We tasted a few beers and finally settled on two we liked. The Black Hole Sun IPA is very tasty and good for those who really enjoy IPAs. My friend got the Vanilla Porter and that was also very good. They only had five of their own beers on tap, but I suspect they will have more later on. There are also guest taps of beers from around the country, so the variety is definitely there.  It was happy hour, so we decided to order a few appetizers since they were on special. The smothered fries is basically poutine. I love poutine like nobody's business, but this was slightly disappointing. It was over sauced with gravy and the cheese curds had already melted before it got to my plate. I will order it again, but ask them to use less gravy. My friend ordered the wings and got them spicy. They looked pretty tasty, but lacked the spiciness we were expecting. We also ordered the fried pickles because we both love that kind of dish. They are similar to potato chips in their size and crunchiness. The things I didn't like about the pickles is how salty they were and the thin slice of them. I prefer my fried pickles to be a little bit more...picklier.  In terms of the service, I was neither impressed or disappointed. With a larger wrap around bar, there will usually be more than one person tending. We weren't ignored when we needed something, but there wasn't a real connection with anyone. As a newer establishment, I would have also expected a manager, owner or even a brewer talking to people and asking them how they liked the place. Never once did I see someone like that conversing with the patrons.   Lastly, the crowd of people wasn't what you expected at a brewery. I am basing the clientele solely on the location and that it is in a very residential area. Lots of family and older people, but also a selection of business folks and younger people as well.  I will definitely give this place another try, maybe with a larger group of people and with different food choices, but my first experience wasn't too great.",

Both were very good, had lots of flavor and despite the stout being pretty strong, it didn't taste that way.

Fun place to drink some beers. I had the Amber Ale which I thought was pretty good. The menu is a British pub style menu which seems kind of odd for the atmosphere.  Of course there is the Kale/quinoa salad that I swear every new restaurant has on the menu regardless of cuisine these days.  I had the chicken schnitzel sandwich which was pretty good w fries. The fries are great. Someone else had the bangers and mash which was also good. Another person had the Shepard's Pie.. Which honestly was not good. Very runny underneath the potatoes.  I definitely will go here again to drink and maybe happy hour. Oh yeah the loaded fries were awesome! The entrees are kind of pricey for what you would expect at a beer house but it's a fun place. Just not sure about the menu yet.",

Good TVs but TV layout doesn't make sense in either bar or dining rooms.  Problem: food prices. $12.25 for a quinoa salad with no meat.  Happy hour is now 10am-7pm Sat/Sun which is nice.  Food is hit and miss. I feel they're being a bit cheeky with many items having weird ingredients (Brussels with peanuts and honey mustard? Broccoli with corn nuts? Sweet potato wedges with pomegranate seeds?)",

(Yes, we've been here a lot and love it)    Why I give them 4 stars and not a 5 are due to the things that I could pass on: the wings (smoked and grilled = weird taste), the fried pickles (batter is too thick), cheddar bacon tater tots (deceiving, really a spanish croquetta not a tater tot) The hummus and veggies is pretty good, the hummus is with white beans so it gives it a saltier taste...unique but ehhh.

SBC's IPA (I think it's called Dank) could hold its own to any west coast IPA in Northern California or Oregon. Other hits were the Pale Ale (one of the best I've had), Uncle Rico's red and the Black IPA. All outstanding.   And the food is terrific. This place impressed me so much we came back for a second trip during my vacation, so we had a lot of the food. The fried pickles are thin and lightly fried - really good. The smoked/grilled chicken wings were delicious (they inspired me to try this at home). I had the fish and chips and pulled pork sandwich for my entres - both very good (the fries are awesome). And my gf had the grilled meatloaf (amazing!) and a chopped kale salad that she loved.   Great spot, clean, modern but comfortable, lots of TV's, nice staff.

We split the bacon cheddar tots appetizer which were delicious- AFTER they remade them bc the first ones were lukewarm.  We had the sloppy joe, which was meager at best. $12 and there was way more bun than sloppy joe filling.  What meat was there tasted good I think? Extremely average. Very overpriced for what it was. The rest of the items were just ok.  Unfortunately we likely won't return any time soon as it's just average and overpriced.",

I am so easy to please, having worked in the service industry for as long as I can remember...  In which I will say, our server was great. (Thanks Tyler!)  My parents and I came to watch the game and celebrate my late grandpas birthday for him. My dad was telling my mom and I a story and he opened up his arms, not knowing a waitress would be directly behind him with three beers. He almost knocked her, but didn't. She decided to throw a nasty look at him, proceeds to walk away and TURN BACK to give my father a dirty look AGAIN.   I don't know if y'all have worked in a restaurant but that stuff happens, maybe she shouldn't have made such a tight squeeze. It happens, life goes on. I'm pissed, no, actually FUMED at the disrespect. I will make sure to tell everyone I know not to support this establishment.   (She had long red hair past her behind)",

Would have been nice to know both.   So now we all know. Happy hour until 4 on Sunday's and brunch until 3.   They have a big bar with plenty of seating and TVs. During football season, they'll broadcast Arizona Cardinals games, but have all games on the TVs. And they're cleverly marked with the team's flags, so you can know where they are going to show the later games.   Good selection of their own beers on draft (it's ok) and a few guest beers. Plus about a dozen bottles for on-site consumption.  For food, I recommend the fish and chips or the wings.   Clean bathrooms and plenty of partying nearby.",

    "text": "Earlier Yelp reviewers made the bison burger sound so irresistible that we had to give this place a try. This new pub is typical of its type with lots of TVs tuned to sports and a variety of high and low seating. It was a pleasant evening so we choose to sit on the covered patio. Of note to pet owners, the patio is dog friendly. Check in at the hostess stand then bring your dog in through the gate onto the patio.  My wife and I didn't want a heavy meal so we decided to order just one bison burger (with the fried egg) and some fried green potatoes. The burger was delicious, but once cut into halves, I found that it was structurally unsound. The innards of the burger were a bit slippery and I couldn't keep my half burger together. Despite having to resort to a knife and fork the burger was really delicious. There was a really nice balance of flavors from all the different ingredients.  Unsurprisingly, they had a great selection of in-house and craft brews. We each had one of their in-house brews and enjoyed them.",

They have quite a few local brews on tap and the menu tells you what brews are coming next, I like that, keeps ya coming back.  I got sweet potato fries and Cajun dry rub chicken wings, they're triple cooked or something...smoked, fried, and ...I can't remember, anyways they were really delicious! My friend got street tacos and loved them, they looked really fresh.  She also got the fried pickles and they were the best fried pickles I've ever had, sliced really thin.

Much to my delight, it's not some pretentious nose in the air place but rather a homey comfortable space to eat and drink.   They are always switching up their own beer selections, so that can be a bit disappointing if you find a favorite and then it disappears. But, they have a large selection (18 of their own at time of review) so you're bound to find something for you.   I don't have much experience with the food except appetizers, and strangely, my absolute fav are the fried Brussels sprouts. Only downside to them is the honey mustard, so you gotta plan ahead with your beer selection.",

Now the deal is $14 bottomless mimosas, and your food order is separate. That's still a great deal, especially in the Valley, where it's increasingly harder to find bottomless. But once we ordered, they informed us that they limit the mimosas to 9 per person - aka, not actually bottomless. I know that seems like a lot of mimosas (and it definitely gets the job done), but they're pretty small servings and no one in our party was in a position to actually be cut off by the bartender. Just something to know in advance - that $14 will get you 9 mimosas (still a really good deal, just not exactly as advertised).   Food is good but nothing special. The Cannonball Pale is a good beer, and I'm sure their other brews are good too. If you're in the area, it's a good place to stop for a very casual and chill (and never crowded) atmosphere.",

He suggested I go to Chili's. I am willing to bet that Chili's may have friendlier service. He did provide me with the samples I asked for and I did find a good beer but the attitude was greater than the helpfulness or friendliness.

We also ordered the Triple cooked Chicken Wings with sauces on the side Buffalo and teriyaki. This is why the 3 stars, the wings were so dry and just tasted bad. The Teriyaki wasn't Teriyaki and were informed it would be taken off the bill to make up for the oily sauce it was? Overall for a bar, they failed on the Chicken Wings today. Overall a decent place but Id go elsewhere for wings.",

The place was not crowded and we tried to sit at the bar but the TVs were too high, too small and at no angle so sitting at the bar you needed to raise your head too much and your neck gets a crick in it. We moved to a hightop table to the right where the TVs were farther away and you did not have to crane your neck up to see them.  We ordered the Asian barbecue ribs - they were a little dry, and flash fried to make them crispy. They did have a delicious crunchy fried garlic and fresh scallions on them, but the warmed over flavor could not be missed and several of them were a little too thin and dry.  The smoked buffalo wings were good, but not great. They need to cook them a little longer to render off some fat from the skin. We were at another nearby restaurant the day before and had way better wings that were both baked fried and then grilled.  The house cured and smoked ham sandwich with egg on a brioche bun was the bomb! For $13 for the sandwich including a side dish it was a bit steep given the amount of meat they gave (which was not much) however the flavors were so intense it made us almost forget the price.",

They are made up of beer brined chicken thighs braised in red mole sauce served over refried beans and topped with cheese curds and jalapeno crema. Yep - pretty amazing. Happy hour is 3-7pm and they have a discounted menu with limited items to choose from. Plus they knock off a buck on pints, well drinks and wines. A nice find for any beer lover in the Scottsdale area.",

It's an inviting looking venue w/ outdoor seating that opens to indoor dining. My co-workers decided to hold a happy hour here for the first time vs our usual outings at OHSO down the street. I have to admit, I was fairly impressed by their happy hour. They have happy hour 7 days a week and reverse happy hours. To top that, they have lots to choose from on their happy hour meal.   I had the hefeweizen - easy to drink, crisp, and light. Highly recommended! I wasn't in the drinking mood that evening, but I enjoyed the beer through and through and look forward to trying more of their brews. For eats - girlfriend and I split the large mac n cheese. It was $9 happy hour special - talk about deal. We were stuffed from the one bowl - HUGE portions! We also had the charred broccoli for $4 happy hour special. It was quite tasty - just a bit much with the beer cheese sauce. Also had a few sweet potato fries from friend's dish - was yummy, would probably order it again. They offer  a veggie burger - I'm always hesitant to order veggie burgers, but I'm typically unimpressed. The happy hour dishes gave me a little more confidence in trying the veggie burger one day. This place has room for improvement in vegetarian friendly dishes - but meh, you can't have everything. I'd be happy to come here for the happy hour goodness alone.   The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. Love that they have a dog friendly patio. Servers were also very attentive and inviting.   Something that was a bit offputting was the lingering scent of barnyard animals...didn't quite figure out where it came from.   Regardless, I'll be back for sure!",

Homemade chips were excellent - light, crispy, salty & slightly tangy.   Hip, fun atmosphere with lots of TVs for sports watchin'. I thought it was weird that the shiny beer brewing vats were surrounded by sloppy plastic buckets and hoses, though.   Our waitress seemed annoyed when I asked her opinion about different dishes and was less than attentive. She got considerably nicer after the check was delivered and we were considering her tip. It's just one person, though, so I'm hoping she's an anomaly. We will be back for the tasty chow, though!",

    "text": "We went for dinner on a Friday, there was a 20 min wait which was unexpected considering SBC had only been open for 3 weeks! However we took the wait as a good sign. After we were seated we found out why SBC is so popular: the food is fantastic! We ordered chicken wings for an appetizer, they had a wonderful grilled smoky flavor with a modest kick. Our entrees were the fish & chips and the grilled meatloaf. Both of which were fantastic! Be sure to come hungry!!  There service was good as the food runners and bussers made up for the waitress, who we had to flag down more than once. The place was busy so her lack of attention is understandable but it would've been nice if we didn't have to flag her down.  Despite that I would have given a 5 star rating were it not for my primary complaint: the temperature of the beers. SBC has a variety of wonderful craft beers which are made on site. However they are all served at the same temperature: ice cold, which is a great temperature if you're serving a mass-produced beer that doesn't have any flavor. However it's not a good temperature to serve a finally crafted beer.  We ordered the yellow monster IPA and the vanilla Porter, both of which had to sit for at least 15 minutes before the full flavor started to come out. Once the beers had warmed up they were fantastic and full of flavor but it would've been better if they were both served at approx 50-55 to start with.   The temperature of the beer is a fairly minor complaint, especially since they can always warm up. I would highly recommend checking out SBC for dinner, happy hour or just to relax and have a beverage!",

I went to watch a Diamondbacks game with a friend, and figured SBC would be a great place to go since there dozens of televisions! Long story short, the owner refused to change one of the two TV's on our side of the bar because they were \"both reserved.\" The only other group on our side of the bar supposedly had one of the TV's reserved, I understand that.   However, the second TV was broadcasting the 4th quarter of a 30 point blowout in a basketball game which was also being shown on at least 10 other TV\"s. I kindly asked the owner if he could reconsider changing that 2nd TV broadcasting the blowout, in which he said \"sorry it's reserved\" and basically walked away. The dude was very rude and disrespectful, I've heard that he's an egomaniac and he sure is!  I was incredibly disappointed with this experience.I loved coming to this place but unfortunately I won't be coming back again.",

We immediately found two seats at the bar, sat down and received our menus.  Pretty decent variety of beer and food. Bar staff was not inquisitive as to \"was this our first time?\", \"what do you like in a beer?\" etc.  Never got a smile from anyone.  Did we remind them of someone they'd had a bad experience with?  Ordered our beers, kale and quinoa salad and blackened salmon BLT with fries.  Everything was just mediocre.  Beer sub megiocre.  That being said, we reflected on how it could have been OK (barely) had the service been more pleasant.  Spent dishes stayed until people sat down around us and stuff was in the way.  Won't be back for sure.",

We ordered the fried pickles, street tacos, and the smothered fries. The fried pickles are sliced thin and not heavily battered which was very refreshing. Because they were cut so thin they were still crunchy and the dipping sauce was delicious. The street tacos were out of this world. The pulled pork was a little spicy and super flavorful. The orange slice was a nice burst of flavor. The smothered fries were smothered in gravy as advertised and tasted great! Very good experience here as it was our first time and didn't know what to expect. I will say the service was very attentive but not much personality. Nothing terrible about that though.

    "text": "While in Scottsdale, we were looking for a brew pub and we found SBC via YELP.  We generally look for a good beer selection first, the food is secondary, as most brew pubs offer a decent burger, wings, appetizer menu.  The website boasted 18 draft beers, with some nice choices.  We ordered a 6 beer flight of IPA's, they were 5 oz tasters for $10, a very affordable price for the beer.  I generally will order flights when trying a new brewery with nothing that jumps out at me.  Four of the six beer were good, two were pretty much undrinkable.  Keep in mind all craft beer drinkers have different palates, so to each his own.  Now for the food, we ordered some appetizers, variations of veggies, fried brussel sprouts (awesome), charred broccoli (very good) and street tacos (good).  Our entries were Southwest Chicken Salad (good), Salmon BLT (good), The Godfather (good).  If visiting Scottsdale, you won't be disappointed, fairly good beer selection and food is good.  Three starts because in a city the size of Scottsdale, there are probably some really good options out there, we'll keep looking.",

    "text": "Decent local brewery with a limited menu selection that has some very overpriced items. We've been there twice now. First the beer - since its a brewery. There is a pretty large selection of craft beers, but I must say most of them seem to be \"trendy hipster\" type beers. A connoisseur would probably enjoy trying all the different types; I'm more of a lager guy and I really could not find a single beer that seemed light and refreshing for the hot Scottsdale weather. The waitress could only recommend a pretty hoppy and malty pilsner. We ended up taking a gamble on a beer that had quite the poetic description of its flavor profile; it was gross and we couldn't even finish a glass. There wasn't anything wrong wit the beer, some people may absolutely love it, but it wasn't for us - it was just too pungent and overwhelming. While I can appreciate the artistry of the beers they craft, this simply isn't a brewery that caters to my tastes, it's more for trendy hipster types who like fancy & esoteric brews.   The food - some of the items were quite good, but way overpriced. If I had to recommend 1 item, it would be the Bison Burger. Really good! but, again, expensive at around $15!  My girlfriend had the veggie burger and found it \"ok, nothing special\". Again, not worth the high price. The biggest disappointment was the fish 'n chips entree - the walleye. For almost $20 I got three tiny pieces of fish, about the size of a small chicken strip and mostly just oily batter, and then a ton of soggy fries. I would definitely NOT recommend this dish - you get about $4 worth of food. I totally felt ripped off.  Overall, with a decent atmosphere and locally crafted brews, the food is good but way overpriced. If I was rich, I would be a repeat customer, otherwise I can't really think of a reason to go back - unless they discounted the Bison burger! Two people can easily spend $75 there and I bet that 50/50 chance that at least one of the entrees will be disappointing. Not good value at all.",

Anyhoo, I tried the $5 Vanilla Porter beer and it was not even close to being as tasty as Brekenridge Vanilla Porter. Due to lack of choices in this part of town though, the place should stay crowded, but they need to jazz up the menu a bit and offer better discounts at prime hours to get me over there.",
