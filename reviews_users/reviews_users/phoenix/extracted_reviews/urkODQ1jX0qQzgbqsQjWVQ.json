But honestly...the food is OK...better than average... a bit expensive for the portion size...and the warehouse  high ceilings made it blasting loud! (My gal friend and I were shouting at one another, until the crowd settled down after 2:30pm) BUT the service was SUPER friendly and helpful. I WOULD GO BACK, but would not want to be starving with my $10 bill in hand! The bathrooms were very clean ...and cute...AND QUIET!! Haha! ...enjoy your loud, cute fun and expensive experience at busy crowded FLOWER CHILD!",

Fantastic Customer Service (Got a greeting right away and an offer to help with any questions. In the dining room. Helpful, friendly, aware staff were constantly running around, busing tables, offering extra help, and readily available.) 4. Almost everything is customer friendly. You don't even have to ask for to-go containers, and the center-pieces on the tables have all the silverware and stuff you'll need (and there's more near the drink station).  5. Extremely cute inside.   Small cons:  1. Typically busy (Long line during peak hours and a healthy amount of noise) 2, You pay a lot for the little amount of food you get (but that's expected on this side of town and it is high-quality food).  3. the flow of the place is confusing. (So many options for entrances and exits and bathrooms and only one place to order. You walk in on one side and then realize the other side is where the line is and it's out the door).",

Being just a couple blocks down from my green beauty headquarters at the Biltmore what a convenient place this would be to grab a healthy lunch or dinner on an occasional basis. When I walked in the decor was super very fun and welcoming. The menu I thought was a bit confusing at first but figured it out. I realize that you could really customize it which I like. I love this place and now stop and pick up a lunch or dinner to go. Knowing that they use all local and fresh ingredients is super important to me as well.",

You'll have a mix of families, Arcadia moms, health conscious crowds and ladies clubs but that aside it's definitely a very enjoyable place and the food is of good if not great quality though perhaps slightly on the bland side (but that's better for me than too salty or too spicy).  my favorite dish is the Flying Avocado, a wrap with grilled chicken, gouda cheese, romaine,  tomato, avocado and hummus. I look forward to going to be again though perhaps not often since it's out of my area but I can definitely recommend it and believe they will be adding a new location soon from what I heard from the chef.",

It is tucked behind Schmidt Jewelers on the Northeast corner of 44rh St and Camelback.   The decor is everything you would expect from a Sam Fox Restaurant,  very nice and inviting.   I tried The Rebel Wrap - Steak and the home made lemonade which both were very good. You order at the counter, a person assigns you a table and they bring the food to your table. The drinks are all in dispensers so you help yourself.   Would recommend this place as a good place for lunch more so than dinner.   Food was good, not real large portions but enough to fill you up.  Would recommend trying this place and look forward to coming back to try another dish",

Individuals who follow gluten free diets are also happy with the numerous GF options.    I have eaten here at lunch and dinner.  I usually order the vegetable & grains mix and match.  I have specifically enjoyed the spiced cauliflower, the GF mac and cheese, broccoli, soba noodles, and the sweet potatoes.  The spiced cauliflower is a favorite.  The interesting teas have free refill stations towards the east side of the restaurant.   The prices are higher than most counter-based service restaurants; however, the food is high quality and healthy.   Service: The service is OK. It's often crowded, but the food comes out quickly.  I wouldn't say it's overly friendly but not rude either - just average.",

It's a bit more expensive than fast food, don't get me wrong, but the quality is so good, you really are getting a great deal.   I need to put a quick qualifier on this and say that this stops being True pretty quickly if you are committed to meat with every meal. Adding \"protein\" is a pricy proposition here, but it's also 100% not necessary. You'll be full with chicken or without, so I would say skip it. This place does vegetarian fare really well, so enjoy it!  The restaurant layout is perfect for a casual lunch with friends, and a wide variety of tea and lemonades to have as a beverage.

I came to Phoenix for a work trip and stayed at a resort for most of my time there. I had one more meal left before I would board a plane back to New York City, and I'm glad I came to Flower Child. I had the Thai wrap and it was delicious and spicy. The side green salad itself needs a round of applause. The salad leaves were surprisingly soft - like someone massaged the dressing in! The quality and presentation of the food was much finer than most fast casual restaurants. I enjoyed my food and hope to come back to try more!",

Scenes a little yuppie  (But that's ok!) and prices are pretty steep-- again, fresh produce is expensive.   The manager (I think he's the manager) gave my niece a flower (such a nice gesture) and was so lovely to us and the entire room (staff like that really set the tone for a great dining experience).  If you're looking for quality food, friendly service and are not too concerned about price, Flower Child is DOPE. Get the vegan caesar with chicken or the flying avocado wrap (delicious).   You'll leave this place happy and not overstuffed.",

I'm glad they changed their menu up a bit. Will be going more often!",

Tonight enjoyed the grass fed steak, spinach with crazy good garlic 'sauce' and their delish broccoli.  Desert because I had to..  chocolate gluten free cupcake things.. iced and I'm sure they don't qualify as 'health food'.  I had two :( I'll go back soon and already have my next dinner planned (friend had this and I snitched bites). Steak, because it's so good and perfectly seasoned, sweet potatoes with sesame seeds and eggplant.. I think that had a Thai sauce... whatever it was, it was great and I don't even like eggplant :) It was a great meal and I am looking forward to going back soon!",

My husband had the cashew quinoa with salmon, as he usually does. But it was so loaded with sauce and salt that the salmon and the quinoa were both ... Soggy! It was slimy and gross to look at. He made himself eat a little and we just left.   This has been a favorite of ours since moving to Scottsdale from SF. I'm really hoping this review reaches someone who can figure out what's up.",

The coconut juice from the coconut they opened was rather bland too.  I remember going to Hawaii and drinking the juice from the fresh coconuts there and that was an awesome experience.

Flower Child isn't just your average cafe with healthy options. Similar to True Foods, a lot of the dishes here are made with a unique combination of ingredients, spices, and fresh herbs that blend together perfectly. Unlike a lot of healthy food restaurants, everything I've tried on Flower Child's menu is bursting with delicious flavor. Coming from someone who loves cooking and doesn't eat out a lot, this is one of the few restaurants I will always give into when I am near one of the locations. As if the food wasn't good enough, customer service has also been constantly exceptionally good at all three locations in the valley. The cashiers/food runners always greet me with a smile and make me feel very welcome. If you are someone who likes good healthy food options with a lot of flavor then do yourself a favor and come here. My favorite Fox restaurant without a doubt!",

I went today Sunday with my boyfriend around 3 PM, the place was 90% full and we found a really nice spot outside. The food was delicious, mostly organic, good price considering the quality. The staff attention was good, lovely ladies explained us the menu and made us some recommendations.  The food was served really fast. I ordered red chili glazed Sweet potato with bok choy sesame seeds beats avocado citrus & tofu. I really enjoyed the tofu because was grilled. My boyfriend ordered the Veg Out with grilled Portobello hummus cucumber onions quinoa wrap, it was good but mine was much.  Decoration is nice and comfortable but nothing over-the-top. Definitely I'll come back to try other options",

Phoenix becomes a better place every time Sam Fox opens a new restaurant.   We shared the avocado hummus which was fantastic. I had the beets, sweet potatoes, and a side of chicken for protein. I was OBSESSED with the beets and sweet potatoes. The chicken was plain grilled, but with some hummus and Cholula it was just right. Lemonade was great as well, especially since you can mix and match to make your own Arnold Palmer. Definitely will be coming back very soon!",

    "text": "Flower child, please come to Houston, TX! I love this restaurant and the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant. It's very zen and the menu is wholesome and organic. You wait in line and order at the counter before sitting down.   Kombucha on tap for $5 is a bit pricey especially in the size cup it comes in.   My friends and I ordered the mother earth bowl with chicken, sweet corn and quinoa children's meal, brussel sprouts and roasted cauliflower as sides and the rebel wrap.   The mother earth bowl comes with ancient grains, sweet potato, portobello mushroom, avocado, cucumber, broccoli pesto, leafy greens, red pepper miso vinaigrette, hemp seed. The chicken was very bland so I wouldn't say it was worth the $5. It's probably slices half the size of a small chicken breast. I liked the sweet potatoes and all the flavors and texture of this bowl. It was quite filling.   The rebel wrap comes with grass-fed steak, charred onion, port salut cheese, horseradish yogurt, arugula. This wasn't as filling as it did not come with any sides. It was an OK wrap. The steak portion was small.   Surprisingly the sweet corn and quinoa was good. I'm not a huge fan of corn but the subtle sweetness got me coming back for more.   I wish the portion for the sides was more substantial. For the price I would have expected it to be. However both were flavorful and we enjoyed them. A bit strong on the curry of the cauliflower but our favorite was the brussel sprouts.",

Bae comes here for food all the time, it is right by his place and since he became vegan, he likes that they have great veggie heavy meals with brown rice. It's also walking distance from his place so it's become a staple. I'm not a particular fan, but when I saw they had a poke bowl I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did. The space is big and very chic. I love the decor and there's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. You can order at the counter or sit down and they do to go orders as well. The poke bowl is super tasty. I got the bowl with just veggies, you have to pay extra for tofu and didn't think I would need it. The bowl had lots of avocado and veggies and was super fresh only thing is it didn't leave me feeling very full (maybe if I had gotten tofu). I understand why Bae likes the food so much. It is very high quality food and thoughtfully made. They use a lot of vegetables and combine the different flavors in a way that is unique and creative. I loved the bowl and would come back here again, just wish it wasn't so pricey .",

    "text": "Anyone who knows me knows I'm obsessed with these kind of restaurants and have been to probably far too many in the Bay Area, so after a week of being relegated to eating whatever was available on my family road trip, I was so excited to bring my parents to Flower Child for a healthier take on lunch. Given that it was already 1:30 when we arrived, I was pretty surprised that the restaurant was still packed, but everything moved really quickly! The service is awesome, as they help you reserve a table while you wait in line to order, so you don't have to scramble by yourself.  FOOD:  +/- Crushed Avocado Toast with Sesame Seeds & Soft Egg: As the basic that I am, I had to get the avocado toast once I saw it on the menu. Given that it's only 1 slice of whole grain bread, the $6 price tag was pretty hefty in comparison to the portions I've gotten at other places, but it was pretty decent!  + Brussel Sprouts + Sauteed Spinach + Chicken: I combined 2 sides with a choice of protein, and I have to say that the brussel sprouts are some of the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. I loved every bite. Sauteed spinach is on the average side - didn't see anything too special about them. The chicken is nicely cooked with just enough seasoning to make sure it isn't bland without dousing it in sauce as well!   My parents got the Mother Earth bowl with tofu and the Madras Curry bowl with steak, and it got the stamp of approval from both of them! Sadly only 4 stars because the protein is really pricey to add on, but definitely super happy with my experience!",

It was my first time going in there, I was actually on my layover and when I do this particular route the spot where I layover is right outside this restaurant. So I yelped it to see what kind of restaurant it was and looked at pictures also, looked healthy and delicious too. Anyway I'm standing at the counter checking out the menu waiting for a few people to order then I was going to ask questions ( being that it was my first time). So as I'm waiting a family walks up and the guy taking the orders just ignored me standing there( and yes he saw me come in) and proceeds to greet them and take their order. I'm like \"excuse me, I was next.\" Not trying to be too rude because these people who walked up wasn't at fault. So I'm like excuse me I was standing here and was waiting til you were done. He didn't apologize or anything, by this time the family that walked up apologized and were like \"oh go ahead we don't know what we want either\" so another hostess walks up and finished another order and then took mine. Very polite and answered my questions. The other guy didn't bother saying hello, how may I help you. Just intentionally overlooked me. Not a great impression",

If you want healthy and tasty fare, this is the place to come.  I love, love the chopped vegetable salad with the grass fed steak or the salmon.  After my first introduction to this place, I realized I had been three times in one week.  I had to make excuses to drive to the area, so I could go eat there.  It is a good 25 to 30 miles from my home in far north Scottsdale (yes, that is where BFE is).   I had a taste of the avocado hummus and it was delicious.  My kids and husband had the little lemon cake and they devoured it.  My salmon was perfectly cooked last time I was there.  I love their teas, specially the acai hibiscus one, can't wait to try the lemonades.",

    "text": "Who are these Foxes?  I'm in love with them and their design/ concept team. I want to meet them, hang out with them & talk shop, design, beauty & food!  I'm putting it out there- anytime you all have a party, invite me and I'll be there!!! Walking into Flower Child is like walking into freshness. Immediately I felt refreshed and recharged. Everything is done just right from the vibe of the place down to the rust spots on the farm \"chandeliers.\"  It's the kind of place aside from having amazing conversation, if out of space, you can throw a blanket on the floor, start a picnic on the floor with your entrees and still feel right at home.  And the food!  The menu is organic, gluten free, vegan with options of chicken & steak for protein. And everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. It's nourishment for the eye, soul & body.  I had their chicken, roasted vegetables, and cream corn with quinoa & kale and each bite was a morsel of a delicate kiss to my body & soul.  I don't think you will have any regrets ordering anything from the menu.  The BEST part I have to exclaim to the WORLD is that their kid's menu unlike so many other establishments that serve terrible food like chicken tenders, Mac & cheese, etc. they serve the same wholesome, delicious food to the mini me's.  It's wonderful, absolutely wonderful that they do this. Whoever came up with this idea has made my wish come True and I hope other restaurants take notice and follow suit.  Absolutely a love!",

    "text": "Whichever property developer picked the location for Flower Child could not have done a better job. This is a health-nut's dream restaurant, and they placed it at the center of a triangle of gyms and health clubs. Smart.  Flower Child has pulled off a difficult trifecta: it's trendy, healthy and delicious.   The Healthy: Everything is fresh, locally sourced and organic. Even the staff. There really isn't a single thing on the menu that is bad for you. Lots of fresh vegetable options, lots of healthy grains and rices, lots of healthy proteins, and not a lot of cheese or pasta. This is food as it should be. You won't leave feeling engorged or disgusting. Just full and satisfied.  The Trendy: Normally this warrants a degree of trepidation from me. Oftentimes trendiness comes at the sacrifice of tastiness. Fortunately this is not the case. I have a natural prejudice against ingredients like quinoa. Do people eat it because they really enjoy it, or because psychologically it feels good to eat \"healthy.\" But Matt, the host, recommended it so I ordered it, and tried it, and it was incredible. If you are going to order anything, order the corn and quinoa.  The Delicious: Again, the corn and quinoa is incredible. Also good is the avocado hummus, the steak, and the glazed sweet potatoes. The broccoli is just simple steamed broccoli, but it was fresh and still firm and nicely balanced the meal. If you're a little crunchy and feeling adventurous, don't miss out on the kambucha. It's an acquired taste I haven't acquired yet, but don't let that hold you back.  I like you, Flower Child.",

Popular during the lunch hour, this shop knows how to serve food efficiently to large groups. You order at the counter, get a drink and then take a seat at a table to wait for a server to bring your food. You can also order takeout and wait at the counter. Food comes out within 10 minutes max, even on a busy day!   The staff here is always friendly and cold water welcomes the guest upon arrival. For food, I've now ordered four things off the menu. I've ordered the Mediterranean salad with chicken, the hummus starter, the Crudite and most recently, the Flying Avocado wrap. Everything I've had here has been spot on, but my favorite thing so far is the Flying Avocado wrap. It comes with chicken, avocado hummus, gouda (but I left that out), lettuce and tomato. Each ingredient complimented the other and I especially liked the kick of the avocado hummus. I gobbled up each bite. The wrap comes with a salad but the salad doesn't have anything on it, so the side lacks. If you want more than just the wrap, I suggest substituting the side with something else or getting a starter. They also have excellent lemonade and tea, but don't expect to get a soda!",

    "text": "I would give this place 4 or 5 stars for the food - if it was priced appropriately. Unfortunately, it's a little on the steep side.  I ordered the sesame beef bowl with no rice (4 hour body nonsense), a glass of red wine, and a side of the simple hummus. My boyfriend ordered the same bowl, a side of broccoli, and a small black tea. Our total without tip was $57.00.   The part that bothers me isn't really the price. I have more expensive meals than this all the time. The issue is that these are sit-down restaurant prices for a \"fast-food\" experience. You order your food at the counter, get a number, and from that point on the only human interaction you have with an employee is someone dropping off the food and taking your number away. I get literally twice the food with the same customer experience for half the price at Chop Shop, so I just really don't get it.  I will say the food was very tasty once we got it. I finished literally every last bite on my plate before leaving, so I did leave satisfied. So just to recap, my 3 star rating is summed by the following:  Service (the little they had) - 5 stars Quality of food - 4 stars Prices for what you get - 1 star  Average star rating - 3.33  So there you have it folks! The method to my madness. This place, as Yelp suggests in the star ratings, is not great, not terrible, just okay. A solid \"good.\"",

My go to meal with include the Sweet Corn Quinoa.  This is amazing!!!  Whoever created this dish needs an award!  The Mix and Match allows you to taste one, two or three dishes.  You can add a protein to the bowl.  The best  combo has to be the Sweet Corn Quinoa and Sweet Potatoes with Salmon.    Flower Child has several menu options available to the whole family.  They have several fresh salads and noodle  bowls available.  If you love a healthy drink, they have Kombucha on tap.    Make Flower Child your next stop to healthy eating.    #iamaflowerchild",

Awesome vegan options but sides can be a little oily! If you're a high carb, low fat vegan it may be one of those exception days.   Only down side to this place was when I told  the cashier I wanted a cup for water, she asked me what size cup so since I'm a big water drinker I asked for the largest size.  After I started eating I realized that I was charge for a large drink because my bill was more than it would've been for what I ordered.  More than likely she charged me for a large drink when I just wanted a large cup for water.  Didn't realize they had small cups next to the water dispenser.    Either way, I would return to try some more stuff on the menu.  A great place to try after a hike from Camelback mt too!",

We got the cauliflower, which we literally got 3 florets - now, they tasted amazing, but come on, 3 florets!? We also got the noodles, which was in a super small side cup, we finished in about 5 bites.  Then we had the mashed potatoes which they threw on the plate and it ran under the other 2 side cups, it just looked like 2 tablespoons of runny mashed potatoes - but they tasted great!  The wrap was very good, just so SMALL.  We were just disappointed and felt like they were definitely taking advantage of the area, thinking people will pay such high prices for such little amounts of food.  *Note this an order at the counter and site and wait for your food to come out with your number - like Paradise Bakery or Wildflower.  Unfortunately, we left here thinking, ok where are we going to go for dinner now?  So we won't be back, which is sad.",

    "text": "I spent an hour with my counselor this afternoon which can only be described as a crying frenzy about an unexpected catharsis concerning my childhood trauma. Afterwards I felt cleansed, as if I had been baptized, completed a yoga weekend with Deepak Chopra, or visited St. Tropez for a weeklong spiritual cleanse.  After the session ended, I needed to refuel, but didn't feel like cooking. My consort suggested we try Flower Child, a new restaurant created by Sam Fox who felt that none of his other 14 eateries fit the concept of healthy, fast, and casual. Sorry to break the news Sam, but that void still exists.  We walked into the Child and noticed a crowd of 'foodie wannabees.' If I didn't know better, I would have thought I entered THE HENRY by mistake. The establishment appeared modern and clean, similar to the generic feel of CULVERS, another fast food diner, but something crucial seemed to be missing at Flower Child--real people. Yes, this is another Fox place where like people gather. Gazing around at the patrons, I noticed there wasn't any age range. Everyone seemed to be a blank-faced millennial, feeling like they were dining in style, when in reality they were at an upscale McDonalds.  A station near the front door allows you to peruse the menu and order salads, vegetables, grain plates, wraps, or bowls. It's like a 'do it yourself' project. I asked the question \"Is your chicken organic?\" I received this answer. \"It's natural and that's the same thing.\" We all know that natural is meaningless and organic is meaningful. I wondered why these employees aren't knowledgeable about health. Isn't that a major part of this venture?  We ordered the Flying Avocado wrap with grilled chicken, smoked Gouda, romaine, tomato, and avocado hummus (guacamole). I asked the cashier to hold the tomatoes because of my consort's severe anaphylactic allergy to this fruit--or is it a vegetable. It's actually the fruit of the tomato plant. I finished our order with a side of red chili glazed sweet potato and an organic tofu and mushroom pho. We were handed a sign with the number 26 to place at our table while waiting for our food.  The Flying Avocado wrap came chock full of cubed tomatoes, which were sent back for obvious reasons. I took a bite of the sweet potato side dish that looked appetizing, especially after rejecting my main course. What I tasted was a yam smothered in an overly salty sauce. At that point, I lost it and told the manager what had occurred. She asked if we wanted to substitute and I declined.  The Pho, according to my consort was edible. He called it \"white boy Pho\" because it had no ethic zing. It's served with a plate of condiments, large branches of Thai basil, bean sprouts (6) (I know because I ate all six of them) and four jalapeno peppers.  We left hungry and disappointed. At home, we cooked salmon patties on the grill. Not farmed / sustainable salmon, like Fox serves, but the real thing. I whipped up an organic potato salad side and we feasted like royalty.  I don't recommend this restaurant to people who desire healthy, delicious, creative food. Unfortunately if you're after a place that delivers on things like taste and affordability--keep looking. Perhaps in future endeavors, Fox should think more about fulfilling his customers' needs than filling a void with fluff.  FYI: Their menu features Gluton Lite, whatever that means and Local Produce. Does that mean they buy their greens at Fry's? Also note: whole grain wraps are offered as one of the main healthy entrees. Doesn't Fox know that whole-grain foods are not always healthy?  I am the DinnerSlut.",

Parking/traffic is now a total pain the ass.  That said, I thought I'd give it a whirl for lunch today on my day off. I had to make a full circle through the lot before finding a single space. Walking up, I could already hear the buzz of way too many overly excited female voices. Ruh roh. The line stretched well out the door, but it did move quickly. Employees are stationed at the doorway before the registers to answer questions, a nice touch. Said helpful girl directed me to a little side register devoted to take out.   To (ahem) ensure my experience was representative, I splurged for the 3-item mix + match, a big ol' drink, and a brownie (after sampling one at the register). $23.... ouch. I had elbows-out trying to get through the crowd to the drink station (ice teas, lemonades, etc.). Predictable mix of ladies-who-lunch, hipsters, soccer moms, fashionistas in leather shirts and $2000 handbags. Female:male ratio easily 4:1, if not higher. The decor is a little whitewashed-Midwestern-barn-chic for my taste, but it fits the name. It's quite open so the place is LOUD AS FUCK.   I barely had a chance to get comfy on the big benches in the takeaway area before my food was ready, presented in a brown paper bag with a cute artichoke stamped on it, a takeout menu thoughtfully placed inside. I'd just finished checking out the cooler with to-go drinks, mentally scoffing at the $6 cold brew coffee and envisioning the idiot who would think it's cool to drink coconut water right out of the coconut. I fled the scene, trying not to step on wayward children, and hurried to my car as someone in a big SUV stalked me for my space.   The verdict? Meh. The dark greens were very salty. VERY. The chili glazed sweet potato was decent, with an unexpected pronounced citrus flavor. Not spicy in the least. The tofu... well, it is tofu. Definitely nothing special. The clear winner was the sweet corn and quinoa. My God. Strap a feed bag on me full of that shit and I'll be good. The portions are not as dismal as one might suspect from other reviews; this will be two meals. The brownie was puzzling; different from the one I'd sampled earlier, although I'd ordered the same type. The one that came home with me was, again, heavily salted. Not bad, just not expected.  While I'm impressed by the efficiency of a restaurant that is so new, I'm not blown away by the food itself. Regardless, I suspect I will end up here often, because a) it's walking distance from my house; b) lots of vegetarian options; and c) easy for takeout.",

While my meal (Strawberry fields with chicken) was good and my son's turkey wrap was good -and filling, my daughter's madras curry bowl couldn't have been a bigger disappointment. There were about 10 bite-sized vegetable pieces. Honestly it was a joke the amount of food in the \"bowl.\"  Maybe adding some meat would be helped but really it was just the smallest amount of food I've seen in an entree. She is not a big eater and she was hungry when we left. Disappointing for such a good restaurant. We spent $37 -no drinks-for the three of us and she and I could've have eaten much more.",

    "text": "To be fair, vegan/health food stuff is not usually my cup of tea, so keep that in mind as you read my review.  I've gone to restaurants that serve the same type of fare, and absolutely loved it. I was expecting something similar, based on the glowing recommendations I got from a trusted foodie friend. But to me, it was just bad. I could barely eat my entree (what there was of it).  I don't mind paying for something really good, but when I ordered the grilled tofu on my Thai Cashew Quinoa bowl, what arrived was about two bites' worth. When I hear the words \"Thai,\" \"cashew,\" and \"bowl,\" what I'm expecting is something with a slightly sweet and savory flavor, with cashews. I could barely locate the cashews, and there was no hint of the sweet-spicy combo that is, for me, what defines Thai food. What I got was a bowl of quinoa. To me, that's more of a filler or garnish, not a meal. And too much of it kind of grosses me out, as I discovered during this meal. To like this dish, you have to enjoy the feel of a bunch of flavorless fish eggs in your mouth. (I don't, which is why I won't even try caviar.)  I wrote this review not to bash the place, but to warn away people like me who are somewhat adventurous and may find themselves talked into trying this place by well-meaning friends, but who just won't like it, and will wish they'd spent about half the amount on some good Panang curry or Thai basil with tofu instead.  The place seems extremely clean, and was pretty. The people were very nice and helpful. The pomegranate lemonade was good.",

The food is amazingly great...my husband(who doesn't usually enjoy what he calls health nut food) loved it and want to go back the second time. I will say the parking is bad. We had to drive around for 10 mins to find a spot in the crowed lot both times. The service on the second visit was also a lot slower even though they weren't even busy. We saw three tables who ordered after us get their food first. I really like this place and will for sure be back to try more things on the menu.",

Maybe it's what I'm ordering.   I have eaten the cauliflower, asparagus, cucumber/feta/quinoa salad, broccoli, chicken, the heirloom tomatoes (no longer on the menu), the sweet potato, and Mac and cheese. The only thing that would be worth getting is the Mac and cheese, and even that is questionable. Gluten-free does not mean that it's good for you (unless you legitimately have Celiac's disease), and maybe that is why people love this place. It's undoubtedly the tastiest thing in the menu I've had so far.   It's either way too bland or way too seasoned (and SO overpriced) and I don't think anyone will admit it. Everything else, I can cook better at home. I only go there when I don't cook and wish to not feel guilty about what I'm eating at lunch. And that is what I'll keep doing until I get better at packing my own lunch (which is happening quick).",

I called in a huge last minute lunch order for my office (25 minutes later) when I got there to pick it up, it was bagged and ready to go, they even helped me out to my car! Heather (one of the managers there) gave me her contact information for any future lunch orders we have so, she can insure she has all the catering items/ food needed to complete our order. It's 2018 and I rarely ever get good customer service like that! Thank you guys for appreciating our business!",

I am a small women (110 lbs) but my husband and I needed five dishes for us to feel slightly satiated. The food was basic in my opinion. Nothing great and nothing to compensate the price. We ordered the broccoli and spinach veggie plate and there were four pieces of broccoli which meant EACH piece was $1 to account for the $4!! Ridiculous. No no no!",

The lines are always really long at lunch, so I try not to go between 11:30 and 1:30. I like the food, but it is not convenient, especially at lunch. Parking is always impossible, even the 'to go' spots.  I find Salad and Go at 7th St and Bethany to be much easier and more affordable and now go at least once a day for organic non gmo ingredients and juices that are reasonably priced.  I had been a regular at flower child a few times a week, but it was a hassle. It always took a long time and things were often not labeled for take out orders.",

The ambiance is very comfortable, clean, and modern look with the kitchen to be open. As you walk in there is a jar of cold water with a citrus fruit inside for you to have as you wait in line for your food/picking up your order.   It is a self seating of first come first serve although we did not sit in to eat, I noticed how fast the tables where getting turned over for quick clean and open tables where readily available for the next customers to sit.   Customer service was quick, fast, and polite on ordering your food/picking up.    I had their curry salad with salmon. There dressing for their kale salad was delicious with the right cooking of the salmon. I love my fish, especially being spoiled of eating fresh fish from the ocean and knowing how it should be prepared. There are some places where I just cant eat it here in Arizona, it's either too too dry, undercooked, or not fresh.  But, here at Flower Child's it was on fleek to perfection that I wanna try and make this at home when I have some time but, of course I'd have to go back to try my best and master the flavors first.  LoL  Nice place for a lunch visit....",

Unfortunately, our little one had a small allergic reaction to something in an option. They were amazing about it and had her leave happier than when we walked in.   I'm so happy we found this place and got to eat two times before leaving Phoenix. It is a must-try for anyone and everyone who has one nearby them, particularly this one! Keep it up, Flower Child!",

    "text": "Flower Child is a vegetarian' and vegan's delight!  Many choices!  After reviewing the menu which is on boards high above the counter at the entrance (there are also printed ones menus), your selection is given to the person at the counter.  Upon ordering a number is given and you proceed to get drinks at the end of the counter.  The food is prepared in an open area behind glass panels.  The restaurant initially gives the appearance of a cafeteria and I suppose it is, except the food is delivered to your table.  One pet peeve ... immediately after ordering you pay the bill and the option to add a tip is presented.  First why would I tip prior to receiving the service and second why would I tip in a cafeteria?  I have no issue with leaving a tip to the wait person who comes to the table to refill drinks however that didn't happen at Flower Child.    My dining partner (not Knife) and I both ordered Bowls ... a Thai Cashew Quinoa with chicken and a Mother Earth with salmon.  At $14 and $16 dollars, I felt the price was high for the size of the portion.  Don't get me wrong, the portion size was a 'normal' size not the over sized portions we have unfortunately all gotten used to.  For the size of the meal the price is a bit high.  The quality of the food was good and mostly tasty.  Although fellow diner who got the Thai Cashew Quinoa would have liked a bit more 'crunch' in the bowl.  She said once the cashews were gone some of the flavor also disappeared.  My Mother Earth was a great choice and I thoroughly enjoyed every morsel!  We dined at the Flower Child location at 44 St/Camelback; there are a few other locations in the Valley, which I will be trying in the future.  -Fork of Fork 'n Knife  Be sure to check out the reviews written by my critic in food, Knife of Knife 'n Fork.

    "text": "I'm always looking for healthy restaurant options, and Flower Child is a great one and is fortunately close to my home and office.  My one complaint is that I find it a bit overpriced.  Portions are good, but, compared with places like Chop Shop, I just don't understand why it's so expensive.  Having said that, the food is delicious.  My favorite is the Early Riser bowl, which I get with steak.  It's such a unique combination of ingredients, all of which are fresh and flavorful!  I could eat it every day!  I also love the Madras Curry and the Avocado Hummus.  Finally, service had always been on point.  I typically offer take out, and it's fast and friendly.  I'll be back soon!",

The staff was so welcoming, friendly and described the menu to us in detail as we were first timers.    The decor is beautiful...shabby chic and just pretty.  The food was delicious and healthy too.  I enjoyed a veggie plate with curried cauliflower, gluten free mac 'n cheese and sweet corn and quinoa with greek yogurt with some added salmon as my protein.  It was the perfect dinner and tons of food since I was starving!  The raspberry pomegranate lemonade was quite tasty too...fresh made and pretty tart.    As an added bonus, I took advantage of their promotion to follow them on Instagram and save 10% on the total bill...love that!  Definitely check this great place out for a quick, healthy bite to eat!",

Not to mention their whole concept is healthy and earth conscious at this place (one of the kids books they have is about recycling!), but all their plastic cups go to a landfill.  What a disappointment and hypocrisy! No wifi btw!  Old review:  So, I go a lot and my new fave salad is the Mediterranean (I tell them light dressing b/c they really can overdo it), and the Spicy Salmon entree.  Also, I like the soups (the chicken tortilla is fabulous) but I found the Pho, Veggie Bean Soup, and the Coconut Curry a bit too salty.    Healthy, delicious, great staff and service, and really it does not get better.  MY FAVE and the best salad ever - Quinoa Salad!  Add chicken for protein.  Great kids meals that are healthy.  The Salmon Entree is delish!  For kids, the Quinoa-Corn and Mashed potatoes are great (although the quinoa corn is a bit sweet for me).  The wraps are great, my fave is the veggie and I add tofu to it.  Lemonades so good and use cane sugar.  It's the best!  Avoid going at the lunch rush b/c there will be a long wait.",

Why not use hand held vacuums and pick up big food items with gloved hands and throw away gloves ..at least the air is cleaner. I have been going there since the first day but until this is solved I will think twice..all places that serve food should take note.",

I typically order the three side options ( vegetables & grains ) plus a protein and then a lemonade.  The tab for this is usually just under $20, which is why I visit only about 1x/ month.  The staff are always helpful and well informed, the ordering is quick ( if you don't visit between 11:45am - 1pm) and the food tasty.  If you are interested in visiting for dinner, Beer, Wine and Kombucha are available!  I would give a full five stars and visit more often if everything was $1 or $2 less.  Granted, they are in a high-rent area that is prime real estate near Camelback Mountain, Paradise Valley and the family-friendly Arcadia proper.  Parking can be an issue, arrive 10-15 minutes earlier than you are expected to get over the frustration.  With the negatives listed, I do enjoy the patio and the farm/country hippie feel of the cool open space.",

I can't remember one of the sides from the first visit, but the other was the quinoa w/corn, which I LOVED. One of my friends who I came here w/the last time ordered this and I *pretended* like I never had it before just so I could have a bite ;) The protein I had was the chicken, which was kind of plain (I guess that's the point here though), but it was tender and well-seasoned.   The second time I came I got the brussel sprouts, sweet potato, and tofu. The tofu is grilled, which is how I like it. the two sides were flavorful. The sweet pots were particularly good. They were cooked all the way through, but weren't mushy. My group also ordered the avocado hummus, which was DELICIOUS. It was creamy & the pita was really good.   Both times I came here I remember not thinking they give you a lot of food for what you pay for. However, I was full but not disgustingly bloated each time so I do think they give you more food than what it looks like on your plate.   The first time I came here this place was out the door packed (you order at the counter and the food is brought to your table), but the last time it wasn't too bad. The food comes fairly quickly & the servers are friendly.",

The bowl was colorful, fresh and delicious. The pesto was to die for. My friends got equally appetizing dishes. I was particularly intrigued by the Vegan Poke Bowl, which used marinated beets instead of tuna (LIKE, WHOA).   Don't leave without trying a dessert! The vegan chocolate pudding was creamy and phenomenal, and the gluten-free brownie was perfecto. When I can make the room in my budget, I'd gladly return to this place.

That is so False, unless you can whip up the most delectable corn quinoa and heartiest chicken curry bowl in town. In which case, why are you even on Yelp? Open your own restaurant.   So many of my meals have come from Flower Child, and I have honestly never been disappointed. It's healthy, fulfilling, and delicious. Also, their lemonade and brownies are insanely good. The gluten free options--impeccable. Where I come from, which is literally the ocean, they don't have salmon this good. Flower Child is an amazing restaurant, and I highly recommend it.

Fox has hit the nail on the head again with this one!   Notes:  - You stand in line to order and then chose a seat to have your food brought to you.  - Servers are standing around the line looking to help and answer questions on the menu while you wait.  - Very open atmosphere and pleasant experience while waiting.   Food:  + Avocado Kale Salad was much larger than I anticipated. The dressing was sweet but balanced wonderfully with the bitterness of the kale. You could possibly use less dressing, although I didn't find that to bother me too much.  + Mix & Match:   + Roasted veggies were very well done and melted in your mouth. More carrots than anything.   - Dark greens were less flavorful and somewhat bitter.   - Beet/Citrus/Avocado is a must if you like beets. The combination pairs incredibly well together!",

I would give higher scores if not for the \"Hummus Situation\"  - they have a cool option on the menu to mix n match 1-2-3 sides ($4-$7-$9) and add a protein ($varies). One of these options is hummus. Here's the catch, if you order the hummus here as a side, they inform you they don't serve it with Pitta, and that to get anything to dip into the hummus other then your protein, you have to order the hummus appetizer ($6).   Rub is they are charging $4 for pitta, on a $6 appetizer. Here is how:  If I don't do the pick three ($9) and do the pick two ($7) and then add a pitta app ($6) my bill goes from $9 to $13, or a $4 swing for a few pitta slices...  Here's the thing, if they sold pitta for a $1 side, I would buy it everytime... seems the \"system can't do this\"",

First of all, I really like the decor at this location - it's really cute and bohemian and modern. It's nice that it has the fast-casual type of ordering so you can order first and choose where to sit. The entire place is really reminiscent of Chop Shop to me. I chose the Mother Earth bowl and loved it! Everything paired together really well, and each component of it was well done! I particularly really liked the roasted sweet potatoes and the broccoli pesto. I feel like $10 is pretty average for a bowl at similar eateries. The only thing I question is that it's $5 just to add chicken to a bowl - that seems a little much to me considering it's half the price of the entire bowl. Overall, I really liked Flower Child. Good food, large selection, and a lively atmosphere makes for a perfect place to meet up with friends!",

I think the food is a little overpriced and the place is a little too seen-and-be-seen-ish, but I keep returning, because the concept works for me. I'm always looking for healthy convenient options and Flower Child fits the bill. I like how organized they are in the ordering process; you walk in and a staff member will grab a table and put a number on it for you while you order. This process prevents you from having to meander around stalking people for a place to sit, it makes for a lot less awkward experience.    Everything I've tried so far has been quite tasty, the quinoa salad is delicious and filling with crunchy kale and flavorful manchego, I get it with grilled tofu for extra protein. I've also had the \"pick 3\" and I highly recommend the sweet corn and quinoa, it's very rich and creamy you can't tell that it's healthy at all. I also really enjoy the Flying Avocado wrap, the chicken is cooked perfectly and the hummus and avocado go really well with the veggies, also they let me substitute the gouda for manchego without the bat of an eyelash which was really nice.    My favorite part of Flower Child is the fresh lemonade that comes in seasonal flavors and the delicious fresh brewed Iced Tea. I'm a sucker for a good Arnold Palmer and I love being to make my own and come back for unlimited refills. If  you're looking for a casual healthy dining experience in the Arcadia area I would recommend checking out Flower Child.",

I could have held the contents of the bowl they brought me in both my cupped hands. And it was $17!!   Plus, the restaurant is VERY noisy. I had trouble hearing even the person sitting across the table from me. We spent the first few minutes of our lunch shouting at each other about the price of our meals and giving ourselves sore throats. Maybe this is why they sell the honey lemonade? We agreed to try elsewhere next time.   I appreciate the fresh concept and the varied menu. If I were evaluating solely on taste, I would give it 4 stars. However, I had to dock one star for ambiance (noise) and one for price. It's just too unreasonably priced, especially if you can't talk to your friends while you're eating.",

    "text": "I guess at successful restaurants in Arcadia you don't have to provide any level of customer service. It's fine to have a busy restaurant but if the food is going to take 40-60 minutes longer to get out of the kitchen than normal you tell people before they order. You don't keep them trapped in your restaurant after they have paid for food waiting. I will give it to the kitchen staff, it looks like most of them where fighting nobly to get through orders but you can only do so much when the proper systems are not there to set you up for success. I also appreciated the decaf ice tea! The food was decent but the smug child posing behind the counter as an adult needs to learn how to treat people. Seriously working behind the counter at a casual dining establishment gives you no high ground to look down on people from, it's honest work, I've done it myself but I never forgot that I was in CUSTOMER service. I can't wait to try the location in central, it's soooo close to my house I don't think I will be able to resist trying it!!!!  Also I have to throw a shout out to the twenties something women who pretty much ran around crazy doing everything for everyone, she has a tattoo on her right arm, she knows who she is!!! Keep kicking ass.  Edit: the manager was very quick to respond to my review and it gives me hope that they will do better in the future! Also go Hopi hawks!!!!!",

A lot of the young employees do not know the ingredients in the meals and wait for ordering food is always over 30 minutes (even when buying salads).

You could taste the freshness of the ingredients and it was an excellent mix.  Will try a few more times to make sure my review is right.  Doesn't look like they have real juices but more teas.

Our first visit I swung by to get take out.  My dish, a stir fry type bowl with quinoa was basically a bland glob of thick sauced quinoa over veggies - it looked like it had been prepared by an inexperienced 16yr old.  My BF on the other hand, enjoyed his bowl topped with grass-fed beef, though the portion wasn't particularly generous.  Because he enjoyed his dish I was happy to go back and give it a second go.  Visit #2 Thoroughly disappointing :(( My BF dropped 50+ bones for 1 app, 2 entrees and 2 NON-alcoholic drinks AND we left HUNGRY!!!  Our salad app was overly chopped, with paper thin slices of cauliflower that laid low in the bowl ...it was probably $ .80 worth of vegetables for $8 with bland, oily dressing.  Same issue with the entrees - the flavors we're alright though nothing to write home about but the portions were SO small especially for what you pay - the value does NOT match the price, they're consistently skimpy with their portions.  The absolute worst is after three dishes and two drinks for over $50 we walked away HUNGRY!!!  We stopped on the way home to get something else to eat.  I really feel it deserved 1.5 stars, that earned for the bright clean surroundings and generally friendly staff but when the food experience is not good, the atmosphere is little consolation.  We really wanted to like it but overall underwhelming and disappointing.  Do better FOX!!",

    "text": "Flower Child has counter service and serves salads, sides, wraps, and Pho. The food is good but prices are comparable to full table service in most restaurants in the area. Example: salads are approx. $7 or $8 without proteins which are an additional $4-$7; wraps $9-$13; sides $4-$7 ea. Again, this is counter service....dinner for two $40-50 depending on your protein. We are vegetarian so our meals tend to run around $20 pp.  They offer a good selection of sides especially for vegetarian, vegan and gluten free diners. Like True Food Kitchen \"lite\".   Issues: Some foods tend to arrive luke warm or even cold, or at least they have on four different visits which suggests that most food is pre-made and sitting on warming tables. We asked if the food was supposed to be cold and were told they were usually served hot.  All in all service has been friendly. Our party sent one entree back and a manager delivered the replacement within a couple of minutes with a scowl, practically dropping it on the table in front of us, and turning immediately away. She never returned to see if it was better. We felt unwelcome. Staff sits at tables eating and joking around in front of customers. Great potential but some issues that don't seem up to Fox Restaurant Concepts level of quality & service.",

You can definitely taste that there are high quality ingredients used but it was nothing stellar. Now for the portion sizes. I would give that one star. All three of us joked about going out to dinner AFTER we had finished. The portion sizes are small and do not warrant the high price tag. After all My wrap plus iced tea was $17 without tax! Not something you expect to pay for a wrap a few pieces of lettuce and an iced tea.  We will not be back. We feel like FOX concepts struck out on this one. If you want great flavor, high quality and better portions do take out or eat in at True Food Kitchen.",

I am not vegan or into healthy food generally, but my friends are so I go with them and try to find something I like. I tried the quinoa and it was okay. I just wanted more flavor and food for the price. I think I got a lemon bar too and it was pretty yummy.  I really liked the decor of the place though! Thought the setup of the venue flowed really well too. The staff was kind and helpful. Took a little bit to get my food, but it was busy so that's okay. Parking was a little difficult though because there are lots of businesses nearby, but it was also lunch hour.  No soda for unhealthy people like me, but I was happy water was accessible and free unlike some other businesses/vegan restaurants in the area. Honestly, there are a few other things on the menu I'd be willing to try (I'm looking at the wraps/avocado toast) and they do have wine, so if I go on a non-work day a little after the lunch rush, I could certainly enjoy my time here! The atheistic is just so pleasing and calming!",

Pick you proteins and bases and create the meal you want. the place itself is open, bright, clean and easy to navigate. Staff is friend and helpful. I had the kale salad with a grilled chicken breast. The salad is wonderful- chopped kale with pieces of grapefruit, shredded shard cheddar cheese, slivered almonds, and other tasty things. It is lightly dressed. Delicious with the added bonus of being good for you!",

Lately, however, the amount of food for the price ($15 for a salad with protein added) is nothing short of ridiculous. I stopped ordering the Skinny Cobb when it became mostly red cabbage. I ordered the Mediterranean Quinoa today and if it had even 2 tablespoons of quinoa I'd be shocked. They charge an extra $5 for chicken that consists of four bites. I've overseen marketing in the culinary industry for years--I understand margin. They're making serious money off of their guests given the small proportions and ratio of ingredients. I'm not going back.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants for a quick and delicious lunch! Probably the most delicious healthy food you can find in the East Valley, Flower Child has options for everyone. I always mix and match three sides and one of those sides is ALWAYS the Red Chilli Glazed Sweet potatoes. I am telling you right now there are no better sweet potatoes than the ones at this franchise! This trip I also got the Spicy Japanese Eggplant and Sauteed Spinach, a trio sent from health heaven. Their lemonade and tea station is super cute and seasonal so there is always lots of fun flavors to sample. I paired my meal with a mix of the Japanese Sencha Green Tea and the Cranberry Lemonade. My friend got the Vegan Poke Bowl with a side of sweet potatoes (they mistakenly brought mashed potatoes instead but quickly and kindly brought out another side when we told the waitress). She said that her meal was the highlight of her week. Definitely stop and try this restaurant!!",

(But you can add meat to any of the dishes, and some come with meat, so there is no need for meat eaters to stay away.) I've been to Flower Child several times, and have never been disappointed.   My current favorite is the Vietnamese Crunch salad, but I also like the Chopped Vegetable. Both are well-portioned and combine great flavors and textures. The Mother Earth bowl is also delicious if you are looking for something a little more cozy and filling, and I like the Forbidden Rice bowl as well.  The decor is airy, cute, and comfortable. I love sitting on the patio, where there are several small tables and lots of greenery and flowers.   You can also order food for pick-up online, which is super convenient. Just put in your order, pay for it, and pick it up at the register by the deli case :)",

My first experience was a good one and the wrap I had was good as well. This time I was slightly irritated that they open at 11:00 they had people one their patio and what looked to be servers on the patio assisting customers. However, as the line formed in front of us (we were the first ones there) they made sure to keep those doors locked until exactly 11:00 am. We lined up behind all of the people who were crammed up to the glass as we sat in the hightop chairs just to the right of the main entrance.   I ended up getting the Mother Earth bowl with chicken. Perfect portion size, delicious preparation and I left feeling fed, not stuffed. The staff was very tentative and took away items that needed to be and asked if we needed anything else. I love ginger beer, they have that too and though bottled, simply awesome and reminds me of my grandpa...  I forsee more Flower Child in my future!",

Unfortunately, their service is lacking quite a bit. I ordered To-Go (before the rush) and sat for over 30 minutes waiting for my food. By the time I got it, it was already cold.

They have rather a lot to choose from, so if you're indecisive, prepare to scroll through a lot of delicious-sounding options. Don't worry! They all looked pretty healthy!  I ordered the Thai Cashew Salmon Quinoa bowl, and it was super delish! The spiciest, delicious quinoa dish I've had the pleasure of knowing, and I'm not a fan of quinoa!  The only reason why I ordered it is because it was pure protein, and it sounded better paired with baked Salmon.  Every mouthful was succulent, and barely a mouthful remained in my bowl, and I'm sure I'll be back.  The whole experience was very low-key, chilled out. The staff was very friendly, and a perfect place for an after hiking, delicious bite out.",

    "text": "This would be my favorite restaurant were it not for a few things, one being the expense per portion small portion size.  If you want to add protein to your meal (very small portions,) it's even more expensive.  I usually don't go out to eat unless I am crunched for time, late for a meal and or really hungry, or some special occasion, etc. which can actually end up being quite a bit.    Or if I'm low on time or energy and order take out.  One time I ordered from the pick three, and they didn't have two of my items that were discontinued (wish they had told me over the phone,) they substituted picking for me, then asked my son if that was okay.   I love the food, which is usually cooked perfectly.  I really wish I could eat there more often, being that it's healthy and good tasting, which is the single most important thing to me.  However that's useless to me if it's not accessible because of the expense, esp. if you are feeding a family of men that are not filled up on a very the smallest $15.00 wrap I've ever seen.  (plus tax)    I am awaiting knee surgery, so I sit there for whatever seems like a long period of time, while my husband stands in line.  Not exactly relaxing, and if he needs to check something with me, he'd have to get out of line.  So it's not very handicap friendly, whatsoever.  Several times, needing handicap parking, there were no spaces. Don't know how many they have, but oh well.  It's a very expensive self service place.  You are paying high prices, also, to sit on chairs not unlike \"outdoor\" furniture, not very comfortable over any period of time, esp. if you and hanging out with friends to talk a while.  Staff is certainly friendly, but no one checks on you to see how you are doing, etc. if the food was cooked well, etc.   If something is wrong with it, you'll have to leave your table, and if you are with someone, obviously leave them just sitting there, to go seek out some help. (standing in line, etc) or hail someone from the kitchen. If you forget something or don't feel full because of the small portions, you'll have to stand in line again.    Also, each time I ordered take out, we got such a small amount of salad dressing we could barely taste it, and I don't like to overdress my salads at all! so this seemed inconsistent with the restaurant dine in. So I would recommend in dining rather than take out.   I love the mother earth bowl. The salmon is the best I've eaten.  If money and time were no object, I would eat here more often.",

So many special orders makes ordering very slow and the wait is always long even if there are only a few people in front of you. Sure wish the management could figure this out and provide better customer service. Hard to just grab something for lunch if you were working since there is always a long wait. Phoning ahead doesn't really help as you will still have to wait just for someone to give you your order and take your money.",

The first time I wanted to branch out and try the vegan poke, which had a good but the portion size was ridiculously small for the price, and left me searching for snacks an hour later. The second time around I got a plate, which is always a staple, with salmon, smashed potatoes and the Japanese eggplant. Normally the eggplant is out of this world good, but it had zero flavor. The potatoes were great but were ice cold. And the salmon was so overcooked, it vaguely resembled a hockey puck. Overall, I'm highly disappointed that I have to mix up my routine but there's plenty of other great places in Phoenix!",

The price point .....very expensive ......$36 for lunch for 2.  Yep and you order at a counter. With that being said, my husband got the chicken avocado wrap ,and I the kale salad and soup.   There was so much cabbage in my kale salad I had to pick some out.  For that price I should have picked nothing, not one thing out.  It was tasty just disappointing in the balance of ingredients.  Kale should have been dominant.  There were like 3 apple slices and 3 pieces  of grapefruit, and again a ton of red cabbage.    We shared a cookie and 2 drinks.  Very expensive considering what we had.   For our first visit it was great but disappointing too.  Next time I will ask for a kale salad and I mean kale ......  lighten up on the cabbage people.    You live you learn.    The next thing, there are no sound boards  it is LOUD!  We could barely have a conversation and parking was not ideal for how busy they were.

    "text": "Dined at Flower Child (corner of 44th and Camelback streets) with a couple o' others on a weekday and it was quite busy. The openness of the restaurant with its loudness reminded me of a cafeteria, but a hip cafeteria indeed.   I concur with other reviewers about the pricey plates, the atmosphere, the operations, etc. but I did enjoy my time, so a solid three out of five stars for FC and I may return in the future.  There seemed to be a large number of employees (and now that I think of it, FRC's do employ a decent number of workers in proportion to square footage). Two cashiers took orders and a line several folks deep waited behind us. Although a lot of tables were taken, we easily found one with good spacing. No cramping, no leg touching under the table, no one bumping into my chair while passing behind, no \"excuse me's\" with polite but annoyed smiles.  So that was definitely a plus. Another plus are the healthful options on the kids menu.  Utensils wrapped in napkins were the table centerpiece, still you can help yourself to more which are located against the wall alongside the teas and colorfully-mixed ades.   Food was brought to us in three rounds. The plates are small, but I gotta give Flower Child credit for making the dishes look so ungreasy and clean. A+ for presentation. The chicken wrap and salmon hot pot that the others ordered looked good and came with a portion of veggies or salad.  I was the last to get served even though I thought my order was the simplest.   - avocado hummus with pita: pita was too thin and hard hummus mixed with corn, radish, pumpkin seeds salty taste, could not tell it was hummus  I don't favor chunky hummus  - bowl of Pho: who orders pho at a non-asian restaurant?  I stupidly raise my hand, guilty as charged tasty, but I didn't finish it too many noodles not enough mushrooms came with sides of basil  jalapenos, bean sprouts, lime and two sauces barely palatable the red sauce tasted like a spiced up catchup  the darker sweet sauce...plum maybe? I honestly have no idea what it was   - side of roasted asparagus: literally three spears of the plant cut in half  salty seasoning with an umami sauce \"roasted\" turned out to be \"blackened\" and overcooked  - lemon cake: resembled an upside down cupcake yummy, good lemon flavor no overly glossed sweetness  Desserts are not listed on the menu but they are displayed next to the cashier.  After dinner I reviewed my receipt and found out that the lemon cake was gluten free.  Holy anti-wheat Batman, they tricked me!",

I ate here for the 1st time today and ordered a Bird is teh Word wrap with chicken in it and a side of garlic smashed potatoes.  The garlic smashed potatoes ($4) was actually only about 3 bites of mashed potatoes.  The wrap was good, but then again it wasn't that large.  I didn't order a drink because at $3.50, that seemed a bit high.  Anyway, I spent $17.38 and I'm still hungry.",

The atmosphere is inviting          The staff are pleasant          The drink options are FANTASTIC          Their 44th and Camelback locale is in a great spot for shopping too          And the last and most important (to me) reason why I can without a shadow of a doubt say I heart Flower Child - they donated to my cause  I realize for most this may sound dumb, but it can be extremely daunting and hard to get donations from bigger business restaurants like these and FC made it incredibly pleasant and easy. Because of their generosity they now have great advertising giving their brand a soft side. Thank you Flower Child - my heart and belly are very pleased.",

Most entrees are vegetarian but you have the option to add on chicken, beef, or a side salad, etc.   This is a counter service place where you order at a central spot, take a number, and wait staff brings your food. Ordering is similar to N'Counter in Tempe. This type of concept leads to lower prices overall, but add- ons can add up.   Overall a fun, trendy place to get an inexpensive, healthy lunch.",

Everything was so fresh, it wasn't overloaded with dressing, and the salmon was cooked to perfection. It was a perfect combo.  The second time I ordered the sweet potatoes, corn & quinoa and salmon again since it was so good the first time. This dish was also really delicious. The salmon is flavorful, juicy and not fishy at all. The sweet potatoes are cooked just right - soft but not mushy and seasoned really well. The corn & quinoa is my new favorite thing. I need to figure out how to make this at home!  Some people complain that the portions are small but I think they are just right. Most restaurants serve portions that are way too big. I'm willing to pay more for healthy, responsibly sourced food and I'm okay if that means the portions are smaller. Flower Child makes it easy to eat well. I just wish I lived closer so I could go there more often!",

Usually, find  fault vegetarian dishes of other restaurant, but yours was faultless.  Congrats to you and we will return often, even though your location is far from our residence.I might add    your employees were very polite and helpful which made the whole dining experience a happy occasion.

Because, like so much of what Sam offers, it is way, way overpriced -- and this time the value imbalance is just too much to ignore. The portions on our entree salads (quinoa with salmon) were remarkably small. My soup was amazingly good, but there was hardly anything in the bowl. I almost wanted to ask the server if she spilled it on the way to the table. The beer was a bargain at $5 a glass, but the overall bill for two was outrageous at $48. I felt as if I was paying Flower Child to help me lose weight (which I am doing just fine on my own). Sam, you are just too cheap on this one, and it's a shame. A similar but much better choice is Zoe's Kitchen.",

We ordered the watermelon tomato salad and also a streak wrap to share. Loved the steak wrap, maybe the watermelon tomato salad a little less. We also got a trio of veggies to share, all tasty. The Quinoa corn type pudding was good. Loved the tabbouleh. The kale apple slaw was just sweet enough.  The fact that they have so many fresh beverages on tap is nice too.

I tried some of their nasty carrot juice and spit it back into the flowers they put on the table. This place is for old smelly people who have lost there tastebuds and don't even know what they are eating. I would NOT recommend this place to a friend UNLESS MY FRIEND WAS 100 YEARS OLD. Although if my 100 year grandma are here she would probably die because the food is so disgusting. This place is disgusting please shut down this restaurant NOW. Watch out Flower Child this girl is very upset.",

I loved the complimentary flavored water, the soups, the veggies, and especially the gluten-free desserts (although they were my downfall.) The brownie was hands-down the best brownie I've ever had anywhere. The chicken curry dish was also exceptional - so flavorful and the chicken so tender. If I was going to create a restaurant, this would be it. Quality creative food, phenomenal service, and reasonable prices - a winner. And if you eat Paleo, you'll be good...if you can avoid the desserts. Personally, I failed at that :)",

We had to get some gluten free deserts on our way out, delicious.  We were so impressed that we came back today and picked up a family meal for our drive home.

Golden beets and avocados, sweet potato soup with chickpeas and tomatoes, roasted cauliflower with tumeric and dates (my fav), and an amazing kale/celery/ginger/lemon juice. Olivia had an amazing salad, my friend had a great pho soup with this insane anise basil...  Ok, now I am hungry.

You are greater with fruit infused water as you walk into this airy, organic vortex. Fresh flowers peppered all over the place. I ordered the mix and match consisting of sweet corn and quinoa, sweet potatoes, and the beat, avocado, and citrus salad. A world tour for my pallet!

    "text": "Update: Still 4 stars, but the Pho (which WAS my favorite thing about this place) took a bad turn 6 or more months ago and now it's a 2 or a 3 star option. I'm not sure when it happened, but they updated their menu and one of the items that got an update was the Pho - based on their explanation: they made it so that you can pick your protein (the stock is still vegan and you can choose tofu or go without, or choose meat), they added a variety of mushrooms (???), and they made it more flavorful and heartier. Again, that's _their_ explanation. There are way fewer mushrooms. It used to be \"The Mushroom Pho\" with big chunks of flavorful mushrooms, now it's just pho with some bits of mushroom. And the broth is blah now (whether you use the sauce they give you on the side or not - sriracha and something that tastes like spicy/sweet/tangy bbq sauce). There are no more strong aromatic flavors of ginger and clove (and whatever else they used before). There are more noodles, but they are overcooked and almost mushy. And I am not just referring to a bad batch - I order this regularly because I am committed to vegan pho and I keep hoping they will recognize their error and switch it back.    Vegan mix and match grain items and the vegan Thai Dye wrap are still good options, but they aren't very filling for my husband - he needs the Thai Dye wrap and at least two of the grain plates to be satiated. This is fine with him, but if you have a hungry healthy man, or the appetite of one, be prepared to buy two meals for him. It would help to fill him up if they had some vegan desserts, but they don't.",

Upon entering, it reminds me of a \"ladies who lunch\" locale mixed with a Southern California menu vibe. I really liked the avocado wrap (made into a salad, no gluten), organic smashed potatoes, and gluten free mac and cheese. The restaurant serves 2 types of organic wine, and a few types of beer. I had the organic red wine, but it wasn't as good as a Bonterra wine. I would probably skip the wine next time, since they have so many other (non-alcoholic) beverage options!",

I stopped by to grab lunch.  It was a few minutes before 11:00 (they open at 11), so I waited outside along with a few other people.  While waiting, I (along with some others) observed a hostess or other female employee inside look out the window of the door, throw her hands up and exclaim, \"Why is there a line outside!  We don't serve breakfast!\"  So that wasn't cool.  I almost turned around, got in my car and went somewhere else.  Having people waiting to come in to your restaurant is a good thing, right?  So despite that negative impression, I waited until they opened their doors at exactly 11:00 and ordered a wrap to go.  Took some time, as expected, but the sandwich/wrap itself wasn't bad.  The rest of their menu looks good - I'm just not as eager to return after seeing how unenthusiastic a certain employee or two were about having eager customers waiting to enter their restaurant.",

The decor is modern-chic with a touch of hippie. The music is loud-ish.   Orders are placed at the counter and food is brought out to the table. The staff was friendly, so no complaints there!   We ordered 3 starters plus 2 meals. We left hungry. But in all fairness, we went hungry and we went for dinner. This is more of a lite-bite type of place: Lunch or a lite dinner.   Starters: Sauteed spinach, Indian cauliflower, and watermelon/tomato salad. All tasty. Nothing special. Small portions.   Meals: Chopped salad with salmon and Mediterranean salad with salmon. Both were decent. The salmon was cooked well. The veggies on the chopped salad weren't the freshest.... In fact, they were mostly brown. Ew.   Overall, I don't think this place is worth it... unless you want to stare at all the beautiful blondes behind the counter. Seriously - being platinum blonde must be a requirement to work there haha. Why no hot men?  Two stars because I'd rather go to Whole Foods and buy cheaper fresher food from the salad bar. I left this place feeling very underwhelmed and saying, \"Meh.

    "text": "I just stopped by Flower Child for lunch today - I'm sure I'm not the first one to say it, but this place was packed. It's like Sam Fox found the perfect combination to make Phoenicians go wild. The line was way out the door, so I opted for the to-go option.   I ordered the organic tofu & mushroom pho with shiritaki noodles, Thai basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and lime. It was ready quickly and I received the broth and the fixings in separate containers - woohoo!   While I was there the environment was great, it definitely lived up to it's name as a kind of flower-child-meadow-old barn feel. It was a big space.   The mushrooms were big and meaty, and the tofu was well cooked and flavorful. My number one complaint is that the broth was way too spicy for me. I like spicy food, I like sriracha in my pho, but this was out of control. The jalapeno slices are cooked in the broth, and it didn't bring flavor, it just brought some really intense, tip of your tongue heat. It hurt to eat. It was so spicy it affected my speech. It was so spicy it still hurts now, an hour later. I can only imagine how spicy the spicy salmon nabemono is, if they bothered to label that as spicy.   I do want to go back and order something else, because everyone else has said they had great food and really enjoyed it. I will update my review when I visit next time.",

The parking Judy the best during lunch - super packed.  The decor is super cute, almost retro looking, plenty of space with indoor and outdoor seating. Is the kind of restaurant where you order and pay, take a number to your seat and wait for it to be brought to you.  The menu is a tad overwhelming, so I had to ask the lady at the cash register where you order how it works. At first she looked at me crazy as if to say \"how do you not know?!\" But in the end she was helpful. I created my own plate with chicken, sweet potato, Brussel sprouts and avocado. That came up to $15.20. A little pricey, but I wasn't going to not get it after I ordered it.    It took a bit for the food to get to us, and when it came my first thought was \"oh that is SO cute! Omg that looks tasty!\" My tummy actually rumbled because they bro ight my friend's food first and I was so hungry. When mine came and I put the first sprout in my mouth, I almost started crying. Y'all everything on that plate was SO UNBELIEVABLY TASTY! Great portion sizes, everything was seasoned to perfection! If it wasn't so expensive, I would seriously eat there every day!",

Some of their seasonal salads are good, too, so that's nice. Still not somewhere I'd probably choose to go on my own, but my 18-month-old loves their chicken and sweet potatoes so we end up eating here pretty often... as in a few times a week.",

I pretty much always get their Vegan salad because the lemon tahini dressing is a dream! They sometimes switch up the ingredients with the seasons but it is always good.   But last week I tried their Mother Earth bowl and it was SO YUM! I couldn't believe how hearty it was without protein. I was stuffed afterwards. It was packed with sweet potatoes, mushrooms, avocado, grains, arugula, vegan pesto, and i'm probably missing something. I also tried their avocado hummus with veggies and flatbread and it was a dream. I love their iced tea/lemonade bar as well. So refreshing!   I'm a FC super fan. It IS pricy, that I cannot deny, but you get what you pay for and here it is super fresh, good quality food that leaves you feeling great! I'll see you soon FC fam!",

    "text": "What a fun place!  After visiting Taliesin West I was in the mood for a light lunch and happened to find this place via Yelp (thanks, fellow reviewers!). I'm a vegetarian full-time and part-time vegan so thought this place would be cool to check out.  Absolutely loved the set-up, from the hydration station at the front door to the fun interior decor and ability to watch the cooks prepare your food. When you walk in, you order at a counter and then take a number; a server will bring your food to you when done.  Drinks are self serve (unless you choose an alcoholic beverage) and what a great choice of flavors (see my photo)!  Love that they have optional straws in a container and don't force them on you...they're also compostable, along with the napkins!  The menu allows vegans/vegetarians/omnis to eat in peace with the ability to add your own protein selection to most dishes.  The restaurant also abides by the \"dirty dozen\" organic produce list, which made me love them even more! I ordered a chopped vegetable salad and a Four Peaks \"white ale\" which was on tap.  Perfect for a very hot summer Saturday afternoon!  By the looks of the crowd, it is a popular little place for many.   I'll be back when in the area again and would encourage you to try it, as well!",

It was so stressful, I wanted to abandon ship. Secondly, it seemed from pictures that this was table service. It's not. It's a glorified Tender Greens where you wait in a long ass line to put a food order in. After noticing that a slew of tables had no food, I decided to put a to go order in instead.  If you're looking for mega casual and not bothered by lines or parking, then hit it. The food options are great. I am an introvert so dealing with long lines of people is not my bag. Just sharing so other folks know what's up.   This area doesn't have a lot of vegan-friendly places so I'm def giving them three stars for accommodating gf and vg people. In the future I would call in and grab or just postmates from here.",

The food was nothing short of amazing & I am soooo excited that there is one only a couple hours from me at home (in Santa Monica, CA)!  I started with the veggie salad but substituted the edamame with red bell pepper & the dressing with the lemon avocado dressing & I LOVED it (trying to reduce soy intake).   Don't judge me, but because everything sounded so good, I also got a 3 option plate plus a protein: red chili sweet potatoes, Indian spiced cauliflower, green beans & snap peas, & chicken as my protein choice. Everything tasted incredible!  Special shout out & thanks to Courtney, who took my order. She was super patient while I figured out what to eat (so many great options), answered my millions of questions (food restrictions/ingredients), & was just all around so sweet (also told me about the CA location)!  Can't wait to visit again with my family!",

The reason why I only give 3 stars is that the restaurant is not trying to reduce waste. For a health conscious restaurant with organic food there should be more effort to reduce waste. When I looked around I saw plastic cups and straws everywhere. Next to the water fountain only plastic cups were offered and I had to ask to get a real glass. It should be the opposite.  I believe there are some ways to improve to be more organic and environmentally friendly not only when it comes to the food selection.",

They've got a stacked menu and easily accommodate anyone that's hungry. They make everything from scratch and you can see workers chopping up fresh vegetables and making your meal.  Whether you're diary-free, gluten-free or vegan they've got you covered. The environment is calming and the flowers on the table are sure to brighten your day.  The only downside is that it can get pricier if you like protein in your meals. I always get the chicken, Mac and cheese and sweet corn and quinoa because it's so good that I don't want to stray away.  Overall, it's a great place to eat lunch or dinner and you'll be sure to feel energized for the rest of the day.",

The Japanese eggplant and sweet corn & quinoa are my favorite small plates (that I've tried so far). We also tried the mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts, which were great!   Love the fresh drinks and tasty dessert options too. I'm not usually a fan of chocolate chip cookies, but the cookie here is an exception.

I asked the procedure, and they happily told me. My friend and I ordered at the same time, but paid on our own tickets. She got her meal about 10 minutes before me. Not cool. Biggest problem?

The charming open layout is also reminiscent of True Food but cuter and more casual.  Even the bathrooms are beautiful - stainless steel and art deco.  But let's cut to the chase: the yummy food.  The menu boasts a wonderful selection of sides and proteins, which you can mix and match.  There are also plenty of salads, wraps and appetizers. It took us ages to order with all of the excellent choices.  Our food was delicious!!  I had Salmon with Organic Smashed Potatoes and Heirloom Tomatoes - the potatoes were magically creamy and flavorful (order this!) and the tomatoes were perfectly ripe.  The generous portion of salmon was tasty - cooked nicely.   I stole a bite of my husband's Thai Dye Wrap, and it had great flavor - even the actual wrap tasted good!  The desserts are all gluten free - we took a couple of rice krispie treat bars to go, and found them to be a tasty movie treat, later on.",

    "text": "Flower Child has been open for barely a couple weeks and already there is a line out the door when you want to grab lunch or dinner.  Good thing it's a healthy fast food focused restaurant.  True to their concept, even with a huge line, the man in charge is at the door helping guests get seated as quickly as possible (you'll know him because he looks like that guy from Ocean's 11).  The food is ordered at the counter and made by a line of employees and brought out to your table.  With a family full of allergies from milk, gluten to peanuts, I really do appreciate that Flower Child has so many dishes that can accommodate all of us.  On top of that, I'm constantly trying to eat healthier and I dig quality and healthy food - Flower Child hits the spot.  You can order anything from kombucha on tap, which is delicious (I'll take some to go) or there many flavors of lemonade (my son's favorites) to teas.  They even have some beer on tap but we recommend the kombucha.  Start with some avocado hummus, the sweet corn and pumpkin seeds were a good addition.  Try the Rebel sandwich and your taste buds will thank you.  The grass-fed steak is enticing and the rest of the ingredients really tie it together: port salut cheese, horseradish yogurt sauce and arugula.  The side salad was simple but worked well together.  We ordered the Asian Avocado salad, a favorite at the restaurant kale with creamy avocado, crunchy cucumber and sesame vinaigrette.  I'm a huge fan of their steak, I probably won't order any other protein from here again, I like it that much.  You can get the Vegetable and Grain plates with or without protein.  The salmon is pictured below, cooked well and kept plain so that it doesn't overtake the entire dish.  My favorite side (you must order it) is the creamy corn and quinoa.  I also really like the gluten free mac and cheese, red chili glazed sweet potatoes and Indian spiced cauliflower.   I would suggest if you are going for dinner, you order the Madras Curry Chicken, I'll eat curry everyday and this one was surprisingly good.   Let's not forget dessert, I always save room.  Their lemon olive oil cake and chocolate cupcake were moist and divine, the crostata was ok, compared to the other desserts, I felt it lacked zing.  I don't normally take dessert to go but I would seriously recommend that you do.  The brownie they have by the cash registers melts in your mouth, it is so good, I will not share with anyone.  The rice crispy treat, oatmeal raisin cookie and chocolate hemp cookies were all good but the brownie, oh that brownie!",

I paid $40 for a salad, one of their signature bowls, and two lemonades. We both were given a very small serving of chicken. For that price, I would at least hope to get an entire chicken breast. I would prefer to go to any of the other Fox Concept Restaurants as I have never left those establishments feeling still hungry and poor.   On a positive note, I enjoyed the vibe of the place.

Being extremely hungry my boyfriend and I ordered a LOT of food and enjoyed all of it.   The avocado hummus was recommended to us and it was delicious. A combo of creamy guac and hummus with flax flat bread. For my meal I got a \"power bowl\" with grilled chicken. It is hard to impress me with chicken because SO many place do not add any flavor. This chicken had lots of herb-y flavor and was tender. My boyfriend ordered the avocado wrap and enjoyed it but wished he had gotten a power bowl. The reason the power bowl is amazing is because the vegetable sides are FANTASTIC. I got 3 with my bowl and my boyfriend ordered 2 sides. here's what we tried:  -Green Lentils, very tasty but nothing overly special -Smashed Potatoes- AMAZING and perfect in every way -Gluten Free Mac and Cheese- delicious and perfect because I am trying to remove gluten from my diet. The only complaint is that the spiral noodles were 1-2 minutes away from al dente meaning they were a bit crunchy. The sauce was delicious though. -Chili Roasted Sweet Potatoes- Most flavorful thing on my plate and very unexpected. Sweet and spicy. Mmmm! -Roasted Cauliflower with Curry spices- Also incredibly flavorful and perfectly cooked  We also tried the homemade lemonades (I sampled all 3) and the Kombucha. It was all delicious. My boyfriend loved the organic beer on tap and I cannot wait to try the wines! Finally, we tried the gluten free cookie and brownie. The cookie was delicious and moist. The brownie was too moist and rich and falls apart in your hands.  Overall, Flower Child gets 5 stars on food alone. The decor is nice although more garden themed and not as many flowers or hippie themed decorations as the name Flower Child might suggest. Actually, come to think of it, the name makes little to no sense... I should also mention that the portions are pretty small on the appetizer and power bowl. I foresee this being a problem for them given the pricing ($15 for a protein bowl and sides). I know some people will complain. I will DEFINITELY go back because of the flavorful, healthy options. I appreciate the gluten free, vegan, organic options immensely! There is a HUGE market for a fast casual concept like this in Phoenix. Hopefully they will consider opening a more central location in the near future!",

I've had ok food and good food at Sam Fox restaurants but I've never had great food. A lot of people seem to say that. I do however admire his success and his variety of restaurants so cheers to that. I also want to give this place another try. So let's get to it....  As usual the place looks cool, good vibe, friendly staff. Very friendly , A+ there. I was choosing between the Avocado Asian Salad with chicken or the Sesame Beef Bowl. The lovely girl helping me suggested the beef bowl win this war and rang me up. $16 for a beef bowl? Really?! Good lord. The salad would have cost me $14. And I thought the $12 LGO salads were a lot.   The beef bowl came out really quickly which was impressive given how busy they were. And it was....forgettable. Pretty tried of ordering anything that has rice in the list of ingredients and finding out that's the majority of what I'm getting. Rice with a few other things here and there. The meat was not cooked all the way, rather chewy. The cauliflower was nice and well seasoned. And then I was left with a huge bowl of rice to eat. I left a good amount of it there. I'm here to be healthy-ish right? Salad, I should've salad. I will salad next time and depending on how that goes decide whether to return again after that or stick with LGO.",

It's on the pricey side, so I won't be eating here often, but it's a great lunch spot if you're looking for something healthy and quick. Try the mango green tea, it tastes like cotton candy!

We enjoyed the counter experience, but come early because it gets busy very quickly for dinner. We ordered a beer and wine on tap and we each got the protein with a couple of sides. I had the steak, GF mac and cheese and roasted veggies. Fiance had chicken, kale and apple slaw and the asparagus. Everything was cooked perfectly in my mind and the roasted veggies were my favorite. Fiance said the mac and cheese wasn't his favorite because the texture is a little grainy from either the pasta itself or because they used a white rice flour (or something similar) but I actually enjoyed it a lot because of that.   We have officially decided that we cannot move out of this neighborhood. There are just so many great places to go and this was a wonderful addition.",

The place does get crowded which is always a good sign.  The staff was very welcoming and I liked that the cashier asked how many people were in our party so our food would all be delivered together. This is the type of place where you order as you enter, get your drink cup and have a number to go to your table. When there are several people in your party you can all order with the same number but pay separate. I really enjoy vegetarian eating on occasion and will definitely go back here (you can order protein with many of the menu options so it is not at all a vegetarian place...definitely one of the more healthy restaurants I have seen in a while). They have a wonderful avocado toast with a soft boiled egg and parm cheese, a fabulous variety of sides, wraps, bowls, and about 6 different types of teas and infused waters. I also had the curry cauliflower as a side and it was DELICIOUS!! The food was served timely, hot (if it was supposed to be hot), and looking lovely on the plate.  My only minor negative is that I wish it wasn't expensive to eat healthy. I had a piece of avocado toast (it was one small piece of whole grain with avocado mash and maybe a whole chopped soft boiled egg), a side of curry cauliflower (it was not very big, but it was a side order), and a drink and my bill was almost $17. Again, I would absolutely go back because the food was delicious, the service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was modern, simple and clean, and I would rather pay for good quality food than a knock off. My friends had salads and bowls and they all looked really good.   Enjoy y'all!!",

I'm not a hippie, I love red meat, and I eat sugar, so you can trust me when I say that this place is one of my favorite lunch spots, especially when I'm trying not to be a fatty. For starters, it's gorgeously designed, airy and vibrant, super clean and feels healthy/green just being inside.  There is honestly something for everyone, whether you only eat lettuce, if you're five and live of mac and cheese, or if you just want a modest semi-healthy meal--they have wraps, plates and bowls and you can pick your veggie/starch and add protein (chicken, steak, salmon) if you're feeling particularly wild. I love that the options are clearly chef-driven, focused on bold, exciting flavors, and cooked to order. They have fresh lemonades and iced teas with unique pairings.  And everything is reasonably priced at a perfect portion...which is USUALLY consistent (clears throat).  It's as upscale as a fast casual restaurant can be, health-conscious, sophisticated and it's BRILLIANT.  My go-to meal is the yuzu Brussels sprouts and Sichuan green beans PLUS salmon (med-rare please). My toddlers love the steak, brown rice, buttered noodles, and most importantly, the chocolate brownies.  Oh and the chocolate chip cookie is delicious.  I spotted a dark choco pudding last week and it stopped me in my tracks it looked so good. Did I mention I eat sugar? I'm *trying* to eat healthy-ish, but I'm not a crazy person for goodness sake.

I would definitely be going more often.",

While my only con is the price point for a family to eat here - an easy $60+ for 4, I consistently find myself excited to coming back. My staple is the Mother Earth bowl which is an amazing assortment of superfoods that is filled with flavor. Sometimes I opt to add tofu or steak, but the majority of the time I go without any meat. The corn and quinoa side is another outstanding must, as are most of the other sides.  A few other tasty items are the steak wrap and the ramen (with an egg, of course).   Once you become a regular, go to Costco and offset your costs by buying the Fox Restaurant Concept giftcards at a nice discount.",

I'm in town from the Midwest and we don't have anything of its kind so this was a breathe of fresh air. And when I finished eating my sizable meal (the Mother Earth Bowl) I felt refreshed, not stuffed, and was satisfied the rest of the evening. Their menu is diverse and they have a few dishes like their soups and a bowl or two that rotate. Another bonus is $5 off bottles of wine M-F.   I liked my meal so much I came back the next day and grabbed the avocado toast and a cold brew and was just as pleased as the night before.  Fingers crossed we can get something like this in Indianapolis sometime! I'd be a regular.",

This is where raising prices and serving a decent portion is a good idea!   Just a couple of months ago when you ordered a side of chicken you got a whole chicken breast. Lately and again tonight, I had four slices of chicken for $5.00. Really? There is no way I am going to ask for double chicken for $10 which is a side to my already $9.00 meal!    Rethink your pricing Flower Child. There are a lot of new kids on the block in the area that are the exact same concept but with more generous portions!",

You're paying for quality ingredients, great flavor, it's a bit pricey but you're getting what you pay for. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who's open to trying something new, they have vegan/gluten free options as well. I ordered the chicken, brocolli, mac and cheese  with my Mason jar beverage. My husband ordered the chicken with sauteed spinach and it was delicious. For sure a cool experience for the both us, highly recommend it!! :)",

If you're looking for somewhere to grab lunch after a personal training session at The Village next door, this is the place!  The food is light and healthy, so you don't have to feel guilty eating out after working out.  I had a pick-three plate ($9) with brussel sprouts, indian-spiced cauliflower, and spicy japanese eggplant.  These were some of the best veggies I've ever had!  I also tried some of the forbidden rice with shaved beef, which was good as well but quite a bit pricier for the amount of food you get ($15.50).  I'm not really a soft drink person and usually just get water at restaurants, but the in-house fountain teas and juice blends were incredible!  Definitely will be back.",

So, what's happening to the portions Flower Child? I recommend this place to everyone. It's embarrassing when they get a plate and get like 3 bites and done. A $15 plate with 2 sides for example, a piece of Salmon that's an inch thick and 4 inches long. What the hell man? Then a few bites of sides. Smh. Who's plating these??",

I am a person who thinks typical \"American\" portions are unnecessarily large and wasteful. But all of the people who say they left hungry after eating here were not kidding. I think most people would need to either get 2 items or add a protein to their salad or bowl to feel satisfied. At that point, you are looking at $20, and sorry Flower Child, there are so many wonderful restaurants in Phoenix where I would rather go and get a lovely sit-down meal for that $20.",

Nearly $20 for a salmon salad at a restaurant where you order at front, they give you a number, and then deliver it to your table. Don't get me wrong, really good but still spendy.

Well, I think it is called Flower Child because we need to be on happy pills from the 60's to mind NOT waiting in line forever just to place an order. Then if you decide later to try the raved on brownies, be prepared to stand in line AGAIN for another 15 minutes just to get pre-wrapped brownies (which were dee-lish).  The food was ok and cold. The servers were all very young and pleasant. The smashed potatoes praises must be from people who never cook or ever made mashed potatoes??  Three of us at the table said the smashed potatoes were oversalted.. Bring your smart phone with games to play while waiting in line to order at busy times and waiting for the delivery to the table. Definitely don't forget anything or you will be condemned to another LONG wait in the line.  What ever happened to table service? Rather pricey for serve yourself dining.",

This old hippie chick loved it. We brought a party of 7: everybody got something different and everybody loved their entrees. The staff of young ladies was very friendly and helpful in accommodating our largish party. Those of us with serious arthritis were allowed to sit at our table while the others ordered for us. I wish I could get Diet Coke with my meal instead of some kind of complicated tea or lemonade concoction. Gluten freeness, the current mass delusion, is catered to here. Diabetes, on the other hand, is real. Hello? But I guess you have to go with the zeitgeist to make money. Minor gripes aside, I will return to this place in my neighborhood frequently. Others obviously love it because the line is out the door, but the wait was not that bad. I'm going to try to figure out when their off-peak hours are before I come back.

On the positive they have unique and delicious sides like chili sweet potatoes, creamy quinoa corn, and beet citrus avocado salad. However, sides from the \"mix and match\" section or other small extras bring the cost up quickly and the total can become pricey for a fast casual restaurant like this. On the plus, the ingredients are fresh, and organic is often used (I saw organic labels on items in the kitchen) and there is a good selection of vegetarian options too.

Today my daughter and I ordered the Pho Soup and the Sliced Beef Bowl. The Beef bowl was decent, but nothing spectacular taste wise. My daughter had the Pho.  This had to be the worst bowl of pho I have ever sampled!  Tasteless and bland.  The upside is the manager was a sweetheart who promptly refunded our money and asked what they could do to improve the dish.  This is the reason why I will continue to frequent Fox Concept restaurants. The employees are spectacular and very well trained, she did not look a day over 21, but handled the situation like a True pro!!!  Also the girls at the counter are dolls!  I suggested that they send the chef down to a little hole in the wall called Pho AV to steal the secret to the broth that  makes Pho the special soup that it is.  With a little fine tuning taste wise Flower Child will flourish!!  The best thing about it is the homemade lemonades that are superb and made with real sugar.",

    "text": "I chose this spot for my birthday lunch with girlfriends. We were met at the door by an adorable young woman who very enthusiastically explained how to order and what her recommendations were. We pretty much followed her choices and picked the avocado hummus, quinoa and sweet corn, a veggie wrap, and the apple-kale slaw! We sat in a corner banquet, and the noise level was fairly reasonable. I would recommend they offer some little bolsters or cute throw pillows as the banquet is NOT very comfortable! The food came very quickly, even though it was pretty busy. I must say, we loved everything! I am anxious to try to recreate several at home! And the four items were just right for the three of us...with a shared lemon birthday bundt cake for dessert! I think three staff came to the table to check to see if we were happy with our food. Clear away was timely and we felt comfortable staying awhile to open gifts and chat as the crowd was clearing out. Restroom was nicely decorated and tidy, and had a clever \"toe opener\" for a clean hand exit!  I will definitely return with other health conscience friends I know will appreciate the vegetarian and gluten free options! Might be a bit pricey for serving sizes, but I'm willing to pay for food that well constructed! Good job, Fox!",

Honestly, I love everything about this place- I love that you can order a mix or sides and have the option of changing up proteins.  The flavors are great.  The setting is light and bright.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I am still kinda iffy on the ordering process.  I was there the other day and had to stand in line (out the door) and honestly, when its 110 degrees outside, that kinda sucks.  Other than that, I give it two thumbs up.",

The avocado hummus, sweet potatoes, and curry cauliflower are standouts.

No where did it say the hostess will get a table or do not order until you have a table. Finally we get a table get back in line get to the counter and the girl says I am going to help the large group behind you. No I told her we have been in this line three times.

So we thought this would be a great local find.  Maybe it's because we had such high hopes based on this other restaurant, but Flower Child misses the vision.  We likely won't return since the prices were just too high, the quantities too small, and the service was so-so (only brought us food, never followed up or checked on us). If we hadn't studied the menu before going in, it would have been confusing to order.  We were still hungry after spending $30-40 for the two of us (no drinks included), so we went over to AJ's next door to pick up some healthy snacks. We aren't big people, just healthy and fit, so we have a healthy appetite. Wish the healthy menu was healthier on our wallets and was more satisfying.  Gave it two stars because at least it's trying.",

This one is a bit more casual, in that you order your food from a counter and then they bring it to you.  Like the other sister restaurants, the food is not cheap.  However, it is very fresh, healthy and delicious.  The seasonal veggies and watermelon/heirloom tomato salad are very good.  The sweet corn/quinoa/greek yogurt is amazing.  I would eat an entire plate of just that.  In my opinion, Phoenix is lacking good, healthy places like this.  Highly recommend!",

Prepare yourself for the menu. There's quite a bit going on.  Here's what you need to know.  You order up front when you walk in. It's ok to step to the side while you take it all in. Once you arrive at a decision look around and see if there's an open register. Someone will be smiling and that's the all clear. This is a lunch / late eve place.  You'll be given a number that you place on your table. Don't fret. No matter where you sit they'll find you. That includes the tables outside. Feel free to meander about, taking your time to grab silverware and drinks before selecting a table. (If you need to stop at the beautiful restrooms the servers will still find you.)  The menu is amazing. The concept is simple: Happy food makes happy people. Locally sourced, organic with plenty of vegetarian options. My gluten free friends will be happy: Tons of options! And (!) they will work with you to meet your dietary needs. That's how cool they are.  I've had the good fortune to eat with friends here and share. Yum, yum, yum! You simply must try the avocado hummus to start. When adding sides I love the sweet corn & quinoa. Yesterday I inhaled the Quinoa Protein Bowl. It's a warm dish. As with all of my visits I had no leftovers. (Shhh.) If you've got a sweet tooth beware. It can be dangerous :)  Take note: Food can be ordered for families. Also, food can readily be made to pick-up or to go.  If you follow them on Instagram there's a one time 10% discount. (Fist pump!) Kids are warmly welcome. The service is impeccable. Come once and you'll quickly return!",

    "text": "If we were going off my personal opinion on the taste of food alone, I would probably only designate four stars.  BUT, this is the only place where the kid meal comes with broccoli (or roasted veggies, kale/apple slaw, you get to decide...).  If I cook broccoli sprinkled with Parmesan at home, my kids will push it around on their plate.  But at Flower Child, I caught them fighting over the last piece of broccoli.  So Bravo, Flower Child. Nicely done.  I took my husband here as well and he got the Flying Avocado, which is a burrito with avocado. But it's not like a mammoth man-size Chipotle burrito, it is a normal burrito, representing a generous yet practical and digestible serving size.  I appreciate the lack of fried food and a fresh option outside of the AJ's salad bar. Because lets face it, AJ's is cool but their salad bar is no Whole Foods, except in price.  The only thing I do not like about the chicken-nugget-less kid meals are the enormous drinking cups that they come with.  The options for filling these cups (outside of water) are a variety of teas (caffeine!) and lemonades (sugar!)  Everything in moderation so I recommend watering down the lemonade for kids, and maybe even adults, if you do not like things coyingly sweet.  What I wanted to touch on (because I doubt anyone else will take it there) is the bathroom mirrors.  I am not saying they are bad, or saying they are good, I am just saying that it is always an interesting sight to be facing a full length mirror while you use the restroom.  My daughter was especially intrigued by this and very determined to watch herself go in as many ways as possible.    So far I have tried the steak, pho, and a variety of side dishes - everything is tasty and if my man-size-burrito loving husband enjoyed it, I would say there is something there for any type of eater.  Except for those who only eat french fries.",

As I mentioned in previous reviews I am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I feel like Sam Fox is like Midas and again he has turned a dining establishment into gold.   My friend and I ate lunch there today. Flower Child is a fast casual concept where you place your order and then they bring you your food.  I ordered the Asian Avocado salad and a side of sweet corn w/ quinoa. Everything was absolutely delicious. I pretty much devoured the whole meal. I let my friend do most of the talking while we were eating because I was enjoying the food so much! My brain was in total food reward mode.   Oh...did I mention that they have gluten free baked goods? I had a gluten free bittersweet brownie and I'm pretty sure it revolutionized my entire life. I'm pretty sure if the brownie were a man, we would be walking down the aisle.",

Over the last year I have probably eaten here 30+ times and over the last 6 months this has gotten worse.  I've mentioned it specifically on  to go orders asking that they check the portions and I'm replied to with a nod and a smile yet I never see the person who takes the order and the one who packs it speak.  For the price paid you definitely are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to value for tee dollar.  Quality good but a sliver of salmon sweet potatoes and avocado +kombucha for 21 bucks is kind of a rip.  Sam Fox feel free to message me and I'll happily give you my number.",

This place works great for vegetarians and omnivores alike as well. I am very certain I saw tears in my husband's eyes when he ate the grass-fed steak.

When I entered and looked around I was surprised it wasn't full of California Soccer Mom's who love participation trophies. Oh, I'm so going to hear it for that, damn I need a filter.   Flower Child has an open and bright restaurant that is great for business meetings, quick friend lunches or planning neighborhood quail crossings (do flower children do that?). I ordered take out since I didn't want to commit to a sit down without seeing my surroundings.   I ordered the Thai Cashew Bowl with some chicken. Quinoa (spelling, grain?) with jalapeno, snap peas, celery, mushroom, cashews and Thai basil!! Holy shit these saguaro hugging hippies (ouch) can make me forget about methane producing cow burgers!! The quinoa was the perfect texture with crisp snap peas and spicy jalapenos. Great flavor with the tender chicken. I would highly recommend adding a meat or tofu for a little heartier meal. I would have given this place 5 stars, but for the price I would have expected more meat and a little bigger portion. I just came back from a run and was absolutely starving. What's not to love about eating healthy and the good news is I didn't smell any patchouli oil!!",

It is in that context that this place totally belies its intended aim. It portrays itself as an altruistic hippy enclave full of good vibrations, peace, and simple whole grown fare.  What you get is tawdry gossip from the 'Village' ladies, $17 protein bowls, and a spot that is capitalizing on the latest trend.  Don't get me wrong.  My meal was tasty.  But at that price and with that atmosphere I would just assume eat a similar meal at a place like Chop Shop and donate the difference to the Peoples Republic of Sustainable Nicaraguan Coffee Growers or whatever the Whole Foods Crowd cause is at the moment.",

I feel like, because of the location of this restaurant, all of the staff have to look a certain way and most of the customers seemed pretentious. The dress code may consist of yoga pants and/or at least some type of workout gear to prove that you belong here. I think that this comes with going to restaurants that are geared toward this type of crowd, so not really unexpected in my opinion.   I ordered the Skinny Cobb salad with grass fed beef and added a small iced tea. The salad was very good, however the $19 price tag was a little shocking to me. I have been to many restaurants and I understand the health conscious trendy vibe this place is known for, but $19 for a salad and iced tea was enough to make this place a special occasions type of restaurant for me. If money were no object I would probably be a semi-frequent customer.",

The wait is so worth it! **They have a separate line if you're picking up or carrying out too** While in line an employee will come up and ask where you'd like to sit (inside/outside). They will assign you a table number and go save you a table so there's no searching for one after you order. I love this idea as it guarantees you a spot and keeps everything moving quickly.  I got the Soba Noodle Salad with Tofu and the Tomatoes and Watermelon with basaltic drizzle. The salad had a hint of heat and was delicious. The tomatoes and watermelon is something I could everyday of summer. Very light and crisp.  My husband got the Quinoa Bowl and he \"freaking loved it!\". He also got the sweet Chili Glazed Sweet Potatoes. It was slightly spicy and very good.  We also got the vegan cheesecake and it was one of the best vegan deserts I've ever had. It was perfect for two people to share after lunch and still left us light and not weighed down like traditional cheesecake can do.  The teas they offer are delicious as was the sparkling kombucha.

This was in continuance of Elite Event held this past Sunday that started with a butt kicking at Orange Theory. Lindsey was kind enough to not only make sure we got our butts whipped into shape, but to take us out for a late lunch/early dinner afterwards.   The restaurant, ambiance, and staff were AWESOME!  Rob who was the manager came by and talked to us about the restaurant, the food etc as well as the head chef. I ordered one of the mix and match plates on which I had the red chili glazes sweet potato with bok choy & sesame seed, roasted brussels sprouts & wild mushroom, sauteed spinach with garlic, chili flake and lemon with salmon. Now that sounds like a ton of food right? Actually it was portioned perfectly. Just enough to have small side dishes of each with the salmon on top. The half star it is missing is that although the food was good, it was missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Like it needed a little more seasoning or something, a little omph if you will. I did try my friends Sweet Corn & Quinoa with Greek yogurt and let me tell you, I was sad that I didn't have that as one of my sides because it was DELICIOUS!  I washed it down with some of the best lemonade I have had in a very long time.  The staff came around and gave us some avocado hummus to try in which we were all very happy with along with a few samples of different drinks that they had to offer.   All in all, it was a lot of fun and again the staff went ABOVE and BEYOND. They were some of the nicest people I have ever met and seemed to really enjoy working there. Will I be back? Absolutely. I am not on that side of town often but I definitely will make a point to stop by from time to time. It was well worth the drive.",

    "text": "Since its opening at 90th St & Shea, Flower Child has quickly become a favorite spot of ours. We visit usually 2 - 3 times per week; whether it's picking up lunch, or dinner on a busy night, we are always so pleased with the food and service. I feel good knowing that they use healthful, high quality seasonal ingredients, although I'd be even more happy if they offered wild caught salmon and organic chicken & beef. I know it would cost more, but if it's a priority to a customer then they'll usually pay for it. I would pay the extra. As it is, I only purchase vegetarian meals, but would love the option to add WC salmon. Speaking to the service, it can be a bit slow at times when dining in, but I just see that as hopefully due to many items not being pre-made. The staff is always friendly and helpful. When we ordered pickup one time, we got home to find that it was the wrong order. When I called the store about it, the manager offered to deliver our correct order himself to our home, which he did. I really appreciate Flower Child, and at this rate it will continue to be at the top of our list of restaurants.",

Everything I have tried here has been delicious and everyone I've brought here has agreed wholeheartedly!  I love all the vegetarian options and ingredients.  It can get busy with a line out of the door at times, but it usually moves pretty quickly and I've never waited very long for food.  I have had to sit outside in the heat because those were the only tables available.  I also love that they have takeout with a separate pickup/register.",

I think its pretty cool that you can make a meal of sides, so that's what I did!   I had the heirloom tomatoes, spicy glazed & roasted sweet potatoes, and the quinoa tabbouleh... All three for $10!  You can also add a protein to your meal such as chicken, beef, tofu, or salmon, but I didn't this trip.   I was craving quinoa, and theirs was good!  I would've like some cucumber and/or tomato in there, but it was super tasty and refreshing as it was.  The heirloom tomatoes were just about heaven...  Drizzled with just a hint of good EVOO and reduced balsamic, and sprinkled with flaked sea salt... My mouth is watering just thinking of it.  And then there are the sweet potatoes.  Perfectly roasted with a sweet chile glaze, chopped bok choy and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  Dee-Lish!  They also have a cucumber mint lemonade that smelled amazing, so I may have to try that next time.  I must note that currently all of Flower Child's desserts are gluten free, but not vegan.  One of the hostesses informed me that they used to have vegan options, and would soon be bringing them back!  Until then, Flower Child... until then.",

I had the gluten-free Mac & cheese, Red chili glazed sweet potatoes and Indian spiced cauliflower. Delicious!   The staff was very friendly and helpful. I needed a lot of guidance. As I was cleaning up my table when I was finished, an employee guided me to leave my stuff on the table for them to pick up. They were all very aware of the newbie and eager to help unsolicited. That's hard to find these days. Prices are reasonable too. Can't wait to go again.",

I am a food photographer, and once I photographed their avocado toast for a local magazine. I don't usually eat food after photographing it, but I ate every bite of that avocado toast! The staff is friendly and professional, and the dishes are consistent and utterly delicious.  A word of caution about parking...avoid parking up against the property under the misters. The misters spray water that contains minerals/salt/oil. After lunch one day, I came out to discover my car completely covered with dried water spots from the misters. I immediately had it washed at the car wash. It did not come off! I spent $100 to get it buffed out. The restaurant management was gracious and prompt. They paid me in full for the $100 that I spent. I will be back...many times over. But I will park away from the misters!",

I had the Broccoli and Parmesan, Kale and Apple Slaw, and the grass fed steak as the protein. The meal tasted great but the portions weren't worth the $16 after tax cost. I had a feeling when I was handed the bag and it was very light. I would only go back at those prices to dine in for a special occasion.   My feedback is to have take out specials ($10 for two items and protein for example) I would stop by then at least a couple times a week. Especially when I want a healthy light meal after working out. I'm sure the ingredients are top quality but it's just too much money for such a small meal and the take out customers pay for dine in atmosphere.",

    "text": "I'm far from a hippie, but I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts, and Flower Child is my new favorite...  I've already been a handful of times and while I admit, it's on the pricey side, I'll pay more for organic, local, healthy cuisine any day.  Be warned, however: the parking lot can get crowded during lunch, but it's worth it to park farther away or be patient and wait for a spot...   Once you step inside Flower Child, you'll find friendly service and tons of menu options for both adults and kids.  (I still want to take my kids in to see if they like the kiddie options, but I've seen others enjoying).    It's a fast casual concept, so order at the counter and find your table and your food will be brought to you.  That is, of course, after a pit-stop to fill your drink cup with your choice of three different teas and / or three different lemonades.  I suggest mixing and making your own unique version of an Arnold Palmer.  Free refills included!  The Asian Avocado Salad with Chicken or Salmon is my latest go-to order for lunch, but I don't think you can go wrong here... just order whatever sounds good and know you'll be nourishing your body with healthy ingredients.  You've gotta feel good about that!  As an afterthought worth sharing, I did order the Raw Local Veggie appetizer a couple of times in the hopes that it would compare to True Food Kitchen's Crudite appetizer, but sadly, it does not.  The Tzatziki at Flower Child is not good at all.  I'd suggest serving with the black olive tapenade like TFK and/or getting the TFK tzatziki recipe instead.  Lastly, if you're looking to bring food in for your family, friends, or a small gathering, Flower Child does offer a \"Family Dinner\" option that seems reasonable.  I look forward to checking that out sometime soon.  Cheers to FRC, Flower Child, and healthy / happy visits ahead!",

You order at the counter and take a number and wait for your food.    Favorite items are kale salad or mediteranean salad with an added protein salmon or tofu. Also have many lemonades which are good but a little sweet for my tastes. Steak wrap is also top notch with a side of gluten free mac and cheese. I like they have real silverware ground pepper shakers and of course siracha.  People who work there are friendly and good at helping if you need something. This place reminds me of fast casual places all over Los Angeles like Lemonade or Veggie Grill or Urban Plates in San Diego.  Negatives would be slightly pricey esp if you get a lemonade or cookie with your entree it will be over 20 bucks per person. Also food times is semi-inconsistent sometimes it comes out fast sometimes takes forever. I've seen this when the place is full or empty, but the food is fresh.  All in a solid 4 out of 5 stars.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Guns N Roses - Sweet Child of Mines)  It's got a salad that it seems to me Reminds me of Mojito memories Where everything Was as fresh as an organic garden  Now and then when I attend the place It takes me away to that special place and if I stay too long I'll probably Bo Bites and Yelp  Whoa, oh Whoa Flower Child of mine  Whoa oh oh oh Flower Child of mine  Flower Child is another concept by Fox.  What's up with his latest invention you ask?  Flower Child is a farm to table concept that is on the rise as more people are aware of the what they're putting in their mouth!  Or do they?    So my group ordered the Asian Avocado salad with Chicken, Quinoa salad, Indian Spiced Cauliflower, The Rebel Wrap, and the Spicy Salmon Nabemono.  From what I gather; everything is pretty much vegetarian and you add your choice of protein; Chicken, Beef, Salmon, Tofu, all organic or natural of course!    The Asian Avocado with Chicken was my favorite! The aroma of the sesame oil vinaigrette was sweet and spicy.  The Kale salad was fresh and crunchy along with the radish.  The Quinoa salad reminded me of a mojito.  No thanks to the Indian Spiced Cauliflower, too bland and charred while the seasoning just didn't go well with the soft sauteed cauliflower.  The Rebel wrap was delightful, but the horseradish yogurt can be over powering.  Finally, the spicy salmon had the sweet and smoky broth which was tasty, but everything was just a mushy mess.    Overall, not a bad place for lunch for sure.  Definitely not a date place, but a lot of eye candy from what I see - wink!  In the end, the whole gluten free farm fresh to table thing is still new.  If I asked 10 people what Gluten is; I'm sure 1 or 2 can answer that question. - Enjoy!",

I started off with the avocado hummus (SO good) and a mix of the pomegranate pear and acai hibiscus blossom teas (for a perfect amount of sweetness for me). For dinner I ordered the salmon and heirloom tomatoes (which came out with a balsamic glaze that actually went perfectly when it soaked into the salmon too... currently drooling). Upon eyeing my tablemate's sweet potatoes, quinoa, and veggies I decided I should have ordered more sides (AHH food jealousy!), but what I did have was amazing. I was very impressed.  The craziest part to me is how fast such high-quality food came out! We learned that the chef preps from very early in the morning so you aren't stuck waiting a long time for your food. I will definitely return, especially now knowing that I can even stop in when I'm in a hurry and not have to sacrifice taste or health.   Special shoutout to our hosts Rob & Matt who (like all the employees) were extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and really made my experience memorable. :) Thanks FC!",

    "text": "Now here's a Fox Restaurant Concept I can get behind (well, mostly).  The prices are still exorbitant for what you get (hence the reason I can't give this 5 stars), but that's the story of the entire Fox family.  Like Sauce, Flower Child is a fast casual concept.  Step in, order your food and pay at the counter, and seat yourself.  Unlike Sauce however, you're given a lot of freedom to customize your meal in a multitude of ways.  And the menu is decidedly on the healthier end.  Tonight I came with my siblings for the newest Fox experience.  The restaurant is located across the street from the Henry, on the northeast corner of 44th and Camelback just behind the Schmidt Jewelers.  When you step inside it almost feels like a health food restaurant.  I'm not sure why, but the color scheme and the setup just gives off that type of vibe.  Not a hipster or hippie vibe, more like an indoor farmers market vibe.  At any rate, we came around 6pm on a Sunday.  It was starting to get busy but there was still plenty of seating available inside.  I decided to go with a veggie & grain bowl as those are the most customizable of the menu.  You choose one of four proteins and then add 1, 2, or 3 amongst 12 possible side items.  For my protein, I went with the salmon.  For the sides, I went with the roasted veggies, organic mashed potatoes, and seasonal fruit.  They also have more exotic options like quinoa, kale, sweet potatoes, and even soba noodles.  For a drink I went with lemonade.  They actually have about a half dozen lemonades you can choose from at their lemonade dispenser (all mixed in house).  I went traditional and chose the house lemonade.  Total cost for my bowl and lemonade was $20.  Yup, its pricey, though I guess the silver lining was that I didn't have to tip anyone.  Took less than 10 minutes for them to bring the food to our table.  The presentation was impressive and the portions were adequate (I was actually expecting smaller).  In terms of taste, I was actually pretty impressed.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and had enough where it felt like a main course of the dish.  I was actually really surprised how good the veggies were.  Some of them had a good char on them but it didn't detract from the taste at all.  The potatoes were super creamy without feeling like I was scooping up a butter bomb.  And the fruit bowl was very fresh.  And maybe Sam Fox was listening to me when I said I despised all the pulp I had in my lemonade at the Henry.  Here, there wasn't a trace of pulp in my lemonade.  Thank goodness.    The service we received was excellent.  Granted there wasn't much of it to be had since its fast casual, but the gals at the register were friendly and helpful with the menu and the woman who brought our food and took our plates was also very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  By the time we were done, the place was jam packed with Arcadia residents, but it still felt comfortable to us.  So alright Sam Fox, we haven't seen eye to eye very often, but you might actually be on to something with this concept.  For the health conscious and foodies alike, there's a lot to like about this place.  The prices are still steep for what you're doling out, but at least here you're doling out some really good quality food, quality service, and the always quintessential Fox atmosphere.  And at least here we the customers have some say over the look of our food.  And once again Sam, thank you for expelling the pulp from my lemonade.",

Oddly enough, I've been through the plaza where it is located probably a dozen times but never noticed it. It is located right by Steak 44 and in the same shopping center where Aj's is.  First thoughts upon walking inside.. vibrant, chic, casual, and a nice garden-vibe going on. Definitely great spot to meet a few friends for a casual and fresh lunch/dinner.  I went with the Organic Kale Salad. A lot of flavors going on..everything from smoked almonds (yum!) to Aged White Cheddar, to grapefruit and granny smith apples.  To be honest, the grapefruit was just too overpowering - way too much of a sour flavor that collided with everything else. Unfortunately, it kind of ruined the salad for me because as I tried to pick around it, the juices started to get on the rest of what I was trying to eat.  The aged white cheddar was DELICIOUS but came in these ginormous cubes throughout the salad. I wish that it was crumbled so that the flavor was more consistent with each bite instead of just getting an entire mouthful of it all at once.  All the other ingredients blended quite nicely, including the dressing.  I'm excited to come here again, but will go with a different dish on the menu next time.",

It was pretty busy when I went, which was at a somewhat obscure time in the afternoon. Our cashier was very nice, told us about some of the delicious things they had to offer.  Their avocado hummus, oh my god. YUM. Would come back just for that, seriously so good. We got just veggies on the side, and it came with a nice array of dipping vegetables. It was beautiful. I usually only get water when I eat out but decided I wanted to try a tea or lemonade. All of the lemonades were too sour or had a flavor I did not like. I decided to go for the hibiscus tea and wasn't too happy with it. To me it just tasted kind of watered down. My mom liked it though! Just a matter of taste/ opinion I suppose.  Instead of getting an actual meal, my mom and I just got 4 sides and shared them. We got the roasted vegetables, the curried cauliflower, chili glazed sweet potatoes, and lentils. I love anything and everything sweet potato related so that was my favorite. Everything else was good as well. Finished off with sharing a bittersweet gluten free brownie, and a gluten free oatmeal cookie. The brownie was extremely rich, but they were both delectable.   I also loved the decor of the restaurant, very cute. Would love to come back and get that amazing avocado hummus again..and try something new!",

We watched them remove some sort of rack of meat and then immediately place our tofu in the same spot on their grill.  We were really upset and called over the manager.  She said \"sorry there is only one small grill so we can't have a special spot for Tofu\".  That means their tofu is all cooked in meat grease and is not vegetarian nor vegan.  If you eat their tofu, you're eating meat fat :(",

After I drove around for 15 minutes looking for parking like everyone else,  I stood in line for an additional 10 minutes in the To-Go Line only to be told they didn't have my order. I was asked for the Comfirmation Email, which was never sent. Order & payment were not made. So, since I was already there after wasting most of my 60 minute lunch hour, I placed a To-Go order & waited an addtional 10 minutes.  After all of this hassel, I get back to my office & have 5 minutes left to scarf down what I would consider Sub-Par hipster crap that wasn't worth my time or frustration. My \"Experience\" might have left me a bad for this place.  Only pro, it was fresh & healthy.  All cons are listed above. Would I recommend this place to my friends? Only with the disclaimer.... Don't order & pay on line. Ride your bike, there's no parking. It's a great place to be seen, especially if your a knit cap sock head with a beard,  because man buns were so 2015.",

    "text": "Been meaning to try this because a) Fox Restaurant Concepts and b) every time I go by one, the line is out the door!  So, finally made the time to go for lunch today.  The reason the line is out the door is because you order at the counter just inside the door.  While we waited, someone found a table for us and put our number on it, so as soon as we ordered, we sat down.  The menu is intimidating for someone who isn't a huge organic/sustainable/locavore/glutenfree/healthfood person, but I ordered a wrap - The Rebel - this is a grass fed steak wrap, and I will say it was the best wrap I have ever tried.  Wow!  One of my lunch mates got the Madras Curry bowl with Chicken, and the other got the Chopped Vegetable Salad with 'Sustainable' salmon.  They both said their food was terrific, and we sent back plates that weren't quite licked clean, but only because it would've been a breach of decorum to do so.  Interesting crowd - it looked to be about 80% young females in the 15-35 age range - based on this observation, if I ever want to target that crowd for a business, I'm going to make sure to feature 'organic' and 'sustainable' and 'free range' and etc. on my advertising!    The only real knock is that it's pretty pricey for lunch (about $18/ea with fountain drinks), so too expensive to be on the regular rotation, but a great place for a 'treat' lunch.",

I had the preconceived notion that I wouldn't like it, and initially just wanted to eat there just for the sake of being able to say I tried it. Boy, was I wrong. First off, Flower Child blew me away with how gorgeous the entire restaurant is. It reminded me of something you would see in HGTV. The service was excellent, with most of the employees wearing something that resembled a Free People catalog.   I ordered the thai cashew quinoa with chicken. It was super delicious. I am usually not a fan of quinoa. All the ingredients blended well together. I could totally have it everyday. It was very tasty, and it may have soy sauce in it (which may constitute as unhealthy depending on the amount of soy sauce), but I am not going to complain. I enjoyed every bite!   My boyfriend had one of the breakfast bowls (I can't remember what it's called) but he enjoyed it very much as well. The only negative aspect I can think of are the prices. They are definitely not cheap and I cannot justify spending that much for their food. Regardless, I liked Flower Child and will be back to try their salads!",

Then I realized there was one by my house at desert ridge. I first ordered the chicken and it was good but noticed the portion size seemed to have shrunk. Second time I went there I decide to get my wife and I the salmon. I can get 5 oz portion at the grocery store for less than 5$. The portion size I received at flower child did not look even half that size and was burnt to a crisp. I mean I felt like I was eating a potato chip not fish . I believe salmon is pink not red. Now I didn't notice until I was home but when my wife saw it she drove back immediately. The manager was great and offered a refund an new meals. However everytime I have gone back hoping to get a healthy meal I have received a portion no larger than 3ozs  and burnt. Even the chicken portion is so small an hour later I am hungry again. Did I order Chinese? Jk. Not to mention this place is not cheap. Well eating healthier is the way to go but at these prices and the chefs over cooking the salmon there has to be a better option. Suggestions welcome but I would steer clear of flower child. They should of named it flower child portions.",

I liked it so much that I pretty much only ate here for the rest of the conference, with other people and on my own.   I actively seek out restaurants with high-quality ingredients (local/organic/etc.), and I really liked everything that I ate here.    The atmosphere is a little noisy during prime eating hours, but I didn't think it was nearly as bad as some reviewers suggest.  I thought that the process of ordering from the counter was fine and that the restaurant was clean and quite attractive.   The pricing seems expensive when compared to restaurants serving industrial quality food, but reasonable compared to other restaurants with good food quality.  Highly recommended for those who care about the quality of what's on their plates.",

Drinks and desert add significantly to to bill. Note prices carefully   2.  This place suffers a bit from being overly hip at times - all the cookies are gluten free, for example.  Their name, a throwback to spoiled suburbanite college students in 1967, seems appropriate.     3.  Why no unflavored black or green iced tea?  Flavored teas make me order water only.  Again, trying too hard.    4. I once got a very sandy salad.  Sure things like this happen now and then.  What I don't like is when the server becomes defensive and offers excuses when I politely told her about the sand.  Yes, organic lettuce might be more sandy, and, yes, if you know that then wash it more carefully.    With places like Mad Greens and Grabba Green in the area serving great salads at lower prices, Flower Child has its work cut out for it.    Bottom line:  overpriced and perhaps missing attention to details.  You can get better for less money and also drink unflavored tea.  Probably not meeting the overall quality you'd want at this price point.",

They offer a wide variety of delicious self serve lemonades. I honestly believe they serve some of the best in the valley. I had a watermelon pomegranate one. Food is fantastic. I had the flying avocado wrap this time which was huge and delicious. I loved the shaved grilled chicken on the inside. I ordered a side of spicy Japanese eggplant.

Tends to get busy for lunch but they do a great job of organizing the crowds and tables.   Prices aren't cheap but quality of food is so worth it. I would come here every day if I court afford it!",

The first thing I noticed was the generous amount of seating (and comfy chairs) which was nice.   The food was delicious! I got the Flying Avocado wrap and a Raspberry Ginger Lemonade. We also shared the Avocado Hummus which I honestly could eat a whole bowl of!! Overall, it's a great place to have lunch, but only when I'm feeling like dropping some cash. Their prices really push it compared to most other restaurants with similar ingredients. I don't think they're that extraordinary for a $25 lunch meal -- and for that I give them 3 stars.",

It's an open space, high ceilings, light and airy colors and booths- lots of booths, stripes, paisley and pillows.      Fresh lemonade are by the utensils and the menu is not incredibly expansive but a little overwhelming for a first time. The perks? Staff is SUPER friendly and talkative. When I geeked out over the fact that they have synergy kombucha ON TAP like a draft, she joined in. It was fantastic.        Not only do they have that but they also offer teas, mini coffee growlers, coconut water, hummus grab n goes and baked goods in and near the deli case.      Dinner was unreal. I did the vegetable and grains platter but couldn't pick just three so I got four different things. The portions are great sizes, i didn't feel like I was stuffed or that I had over eaten.     I tried their beets, avocado and citrus side, the Indian cauliflower with turmeric and cinnamon, the quinoa tabbouleh and the sweet chile glazed sweet potatoes. Everything was amazing and my obsession with sweet potatoes has only deepened after this amazing preparation.        We got the avocado hummus to split and it was excellent-- it has pumpkin seeds with it which gives it a nice texture and flavor variation.   All in all, I wish I lived next door to this little hippie.",

    "text": "I came here with some friends the other week for some dinner. It was pretty good overall. When I first arrived I noticed parking was a nightmare. You might want to get there early if you are meeting people or look for parking not directly in front of the restaurant because the spots are pretty small and hard to come by.   When you first walk in it is kind of confusing; you order at the register and then they bring your food to you. To me it looked like you would wait by the sandwich bar for your wrap/salad since they have the glass there, but I guess it is to add to the ambiance or whatever. The look of the restaurant was nice. It looked like something out of an Anthropologie advertisement. Kind of vintage with earthy colors, but still modern looking? if that makes sense.   I ordered an avocado chicken wrap and got an iced tea. I chose the Acai iced tea which was AMAZING. It was probably one of the best I've had. When I got my food I was also impressed. It came with a side salad that was pretty good and the wrap was also yummy.   I just found it hard to justify paying $16 for this meal. I felt like it was a good quality meal with great ingredients and could probably justify paying at THE MOST $12 for it. But to be honest at Whole Foods I could get a wrap and iced tea for around $10. It just kind of irked me. I also thought it was really loud in the restaurant. I couldn't talk at all to the people at the other side of the table which stunk because we came as a group. Maybe the outdoor seating is better, but it was kind of warm out. The food was good, but I probably won't come back. I can get organic wraps and salads at many other places for much cheaper.",

This place was the absolute bomb. If you are a locavore with a gluten-conscious mind, you need to stop in. We went on Memorial Day and it surprisingly wasn't crowded. My husband said he could literally hear the roar of this place from the parking lot during a regular work day.  Decor was bright, happy and in an urban-farmer style. Every waitress was smiling as they walked around and served people. Trying the pomegranate and cucumber lemonades was fun and refreshing. The grain/veggie plates are like sides and you don't get as stuffed because not high fat or calorie so the price can seem high, but the food quality is amazing.  We got the soba noodles with snap peas and non over-powering mint that were surprisingly cold but hecka delicious. The sweet potatoes were tender, carmelized and babied with some chili glaze and unnoticable Bok choy. I don't love kale, but I still loved the kale salad. It had enough flavor power to punch the bitter weedy flavor down and rise up together in texture and flavor.",

Another notable is the create your own plate with your choice of veggies, grains and protein.  The avocado hummus was the perfect marriage of guacamole and hummus.

Also, they sell \"Boxed Water is Better\" so that was cool to see.",

    "text": "I did a cost analysis of the avocado roll sandwich - I had a hard time finding any chicken so I came in at about .35 cents, this can be yours for a mere 11.00 plus don't forget the tip!!!!. Taco bell has higher food costs.   In a move of total hypocrisy they use plastic throw away glasses- when I arrived they were carrying huge black sacks of waste to the dumpster, really?  I also looked in to their claim of \"Food Raised- 'Without Additives'....Here is what I found.......  There is no USDA definition to the term \" No Additives\" anyone using the term may or may NOT be referring to this legal regulation.......No third party regulation.  I'm still upset about my $87.00 lunch that I left hungry and bloated - they use a ton of salt- I'm happy to pay for a good meal - this place is a total sham- the kitchen is NOT Gluten Free, the servers want a tip but all they do is bring the food to the table. No water....then bring the check- why can't FOX pay their employees?- it is an insult to the guests, get it yourself and don't forget to pay my employees wages...... I cannot believe the good reviews I am seeing here- it must be' herd mentality'- the food is not gluten free-not low in salt - not  generous portion, NOT tasty - good for you is questionable as there are more nutrients in romaine than Kale so that s a pile of crap. If you feel like sitting outside and looking at people go for a coffee....wait- they don't sell coffee!!!!",

For those that think it is pricey, please remember it costs more for fresh. organic (I realize that it isn't all organic) and made from SCRATCH food. You get what you pay for and here you can know that you are eating clean, healthy food. The fact that they do so many things gluten free (I am not gluten free) for the price that they do them for is truly amazing. Love the atmosphere as well.",

A plus for me is this was a good place to take my kid, but make sure to bring someone to get a table while you order. It's a louder atmosphere so baby crying gets drowned out. It's definitely a great healthy alternative for fast casual and meeting up with friends, too. I'll be back, but be prepared for a bit of chaos (just a bit).",

My personal fave is the Forbidden Rice Bowl - to which a protein can be added - I get the sliced chicken. Add in one of their amazing lemonades, and you are already at $20 for a lunch - a pricey meal, but a filling & healthy one. I would definitely recommend this and will continue to frequent this place, however the price may be off-putting to some.",

It was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOK.my&s=376bdcc9dfab1e432a6c5009b0ffb345c37865036abd9394cb2981e7070ef9a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OK.my</a> friend and I decided the music was way too loud inside so we went outside for a more quiet atmosphere-didn't happen speakers were blaring right down on all the tables outside as well. We tolerated it and then I went to the bathroom oh my goodness the music was the loudest in there LOL it was ridiculous!  We watched a young waitress struggle with the outside heaters for a while and then give up. She was never able to get them going, but left the gas on the one right next to us. My friend ended up walking over and turning the knob from \"ignite\" to \"off\" as the gas smell was overwhelming.  The waitress  should have sought help from the Manager to complete the task!!!!  The \"shared\" bathrooms: I do not know one woman on this planet that wants to share a restaurant bathroom with a man.  Men tend to splash and dribble pee all over and women just simply don't want to sit or walk in it!  We also don't want to deal with toilet seats left up! There is a savvy \"toeopener\" handle on the bottom of the door. You are supposed to open the door with your foot so that you don't have to touch the door at all when you are leaving the bathroom after you have washed your hands. This would be great, except for the fact that you have to unlock the bathroom door with your hand to get out!   Flower child please turn the music down, and simply put a \"LADIES\" sign on one bathroom and a \"MENS\" sign on the other bathroom. It's hard to believe these days, that you would need instruction to do this which the majority prefers.",
