Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the waffle. It seemed a little flimsy and not too fluffy.  Aside from the food, the parking was a horrible mess. We had to Valet. I couldn't believe it, but had to since I did not want my car to get towed if I parked in the hotel parking lot.  I would definitely give this place another try.",

I gotta say the ambiance is on point, service is great, and the food...I mean this is damn good fried chicken.  Even the local beer hit the spot.  I'd def make it a point to come here and recommend that friends come here when visiting Phoenix/Scottsdale!",

However none of it is anything really that amazing and it isn't cooked to any kind of exceptional standard. I thought the prices were fairly high for what you get- everything has to be added for an extra cost. Our waiter was alright but he really tried to sell us on almost everything on the menu it seemed. Not at a used car lot, so I don't appreciate that.  Overall, LoLo's is something to talk about and it's definitely not your average place to eat. The problem however is that it just isn't very good, period.",

Maybe could have used a bit more butter and syrup, but not a disappointment.   Everyone was pleased with their meal. The plates were all mounding and the service was fine. The bill seemed a little high, but was worth it to quench that fried chix craving.  And did I mention they have Kool-aid?",

I went with coworkers on duty, and one had never been. We were seated comfortably right away. This new place is a zillion times more comfortable and fun than the old place. The music was crazy loud though, which made it difficult to hear.  I had the Puff's chicken with a waffle (of course). My friends had the Puff's chicken with fries and an omelet (don't worry, I gave her a hard time for that one). The food was hot, tasty and fresh. My friend did say that her omelet was a bit on the bland side (insert a 'told you so' here). The chicken breading was off the chart, as usual - the same that is used on the chicken, the Fat Azz and the Fat Cat. The food came out pretty fast, which we were worried about with such a busy place.  I tried a sweet tea this time, and holy sugar cubes was that sweet! I had to have the waitress add some regular ice tea to tone it down! I may just be diabetic by now.  Our service was top notch, and I'm always down to introduce Lolo's virgins to the fantastic fare that awaits them!  PS: Law enforcement and military friendly.",

Pretty quiet, with it being a weekday, and I was excited to give things a go. After being greeted and walked through the menu, we settled on a bit of everything--chicken, waffles, biscuits, gravy, eggs, and all the things that you slather on them.  the waffles are the round, thin kind. And while it was good, I didn't flip out over it. Then again, my portion didn't come with any of the upgraded caramel banana sauce, so it was just plain with maple syrup. I thought the chicken was okay, too. But the dark meat was far superior to the white, which, unfortunately, came off a little dry. Those biscuits, though, were big and fluffy, and covered in country gravy with a little herby twist. And the breakfast potatoes were more like a potato that had been cut into 6-8 pieces and browned up before being sprinkled with a little flavor. They were darn good, but don't go expecting shreds or little diced cubes.  I ended up finished every bit of my half of the order, and I felt it. That much fried stuff, that early in the day, and you're bound to have problems. Luckily, I just felt full and didn't have any other breakfast drama. This is heavy food.  Next time I want to get the Kool-Aid. I think it's the one on the menu labeled as \"Mason Jar Drank.\" I get it, that's their schtick, and they do it well. It's a fun place to pop in, but it will be a hot minute before I go back. Then again, it will be a hot minute before I eat anything again.",

We had fried green tomatoes to start and some variation of chicken and waffles (some liked breasts some liked darker pieces) and all were delicious. The seasoning on the chicken is just fantastic and the waffles are thin tasty treats that really go well with the chicken. I have no complaints with the food at all.   Now for the bad, the service was one of the worst I've ever had. To start we were told there is only patio seating, when we saw at least 4 tables inside that were empty. After being sat we waited for about 10 min before anyone came to the table. One waitress came out to help 2 tables near us, looked at us and walked inside. She didn't even acknowledge that we were waiting. Finally a waiter came over and said he drew the short straw and was going to wait in us, when clearly he had a full set of tables inside. We ordered all food and drinks while he was there and he put them all in at the same time stating he wanted to make sure we got our food on time. So, all apps and entrees came out together.   As much as I liked the food, I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend coming to anyone. I gave it 1 star based in the attitude and service this place gives.",

We sat down right by the hostess. People came in and checked in while we waited. After awhile, I noticed that people arriving after us were being seated. I went up to the hostess station and inquired as to why? The woman I gave my name and number to said we weren't on the list at all. She did not know why. She also didn't seem to care. A table was cleared and we were seated. It was now about an hour after we arrived. We had looked at the menu while waiting for a table so when a waitress arrived we ordered. We both ordered 3 pcs fried chicken with two sides.  A waiter came over with waffles and two pieces of chicken and started to place it on the table in front of my wife. It came with syrup which dripped down his arm and onto the table and also on my wife. We told him it wasn't ours and he said he would clean up the syrup. He left to find out where it belonged. After he cleaned that up another waitress came to our table with catfish. We also told her that it wasn't what we ordered. My wife's plate arrived with so much melted butter on the plate I had to ask the waitress for a clean plate to transfer her food. My food was OK. I got the strong sense that everyone we dealt with was indifferent. We got our check at 3:37. While we were waiting for that the man at the next table was speaking with either the manager or the assistant manager after complaining to his waiter and being unhappy with the answer the waiter relayed to him.

The place is super nice and prices, I think very reasonable and food fantastic. My chicken came with the most incredible, enormous corn Bread, and oh yeah Mac & cheese. This place is defiantly not a place if your on a diet. Try it on a cheat day. Anyways the food is delicious. Can't wait to go back.",

Our waitress (don't remember her name) took a while to come to our table. She asked for our order, and never came back. And I mean -- never. Someone else brought our waters. An hour rolls around... No food. We flagged our waitress down, and she went to check on them. On her way back, she noted \"I DID PUT YOUR ORDER IN WHEN YOU ORDERED, BUT IT'S NOT READY YET.\" Mhmmm... Seriously? It does not take an HOUR to fry up some chicken and waffles. In a not-so-filled restaurant. We gave them 10 minutes to bring our food, or we're leaving. No food, she didn't even bother making eye contact with us, and plenty of larger parties who were seated AFTER us received their food. So, as rude as this may sound, we got up and left.  Also, I don't understand why this place needs valet. Although complimentary, I'm pretty sure I am capable of parking my own car. They lost the keys to our car, and our car was also nowhere to be found in the parking lot.   As much as we love Lo Lo's...this location lost our business.",

I understand the business decision to get more space, but in the process they lost the atmosphere and it has much less of a 'personal' touch compared to the old place I suppose is how I'd describe it (not to mention the TV's are harder to view so going to watch a game isn't really as good an option as before).  Unfortunately, when I took my father to dinner about a week ago, the service was also very slow, it was at least 10 minutes sitting at the table before anyone came even for drinks, and then the order got messed up and I ended up giving him a piece of my chicken. I won't dock it too much since every other time I've been there (at the old location) the service was very good, so hopefully it was a one-off.  If you have the time, still definitely a good place to go though, as I said, the food itself is what matters most, and it's very good.",

The hosts will seat you at a table half clean. There can be food covering the bottom floor under a booth and expect you to scoot into that mess. Tabled are wiped down with filthy towels which freaks me out. Again I go for the food. Wish they had a management swap or something that hires people who have work ethic. Would be a 5 star",

    "text": "So I moved from Cali to Arizona and we all know who the king is of chicken and waffles in Cali, none other that Roscoes Chicken and waffles. So I've been asking the natives here in Arizona where can I get good chicken and waffles. The answer from everyone is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles. So I Yelped the restaurant and observed that they have a respectable rating but we all know ratings are subjective. I decided to check them out for myself and drove to the Scottsdale location. This is their newest location it's nice with an actual bar, I was impressed because I'm somewhat of and alcoholic. Didn't have to wait long to be seated but I heard that  on some days it can be a long wait, so I guess I got lucky. The server was prompt, polite and professional. She scored points for Lo-Lo's for sure but I still haven't tasted the food. So I ordered what they called Kk's- this consist of three pieces of chicken, two waffles, grits and two eggs your way with cheese and onions, damn. Didn't take long for my order to come out and I have to say it was hot and fresh. Now it looked impressive on the plate but taste is another thing.  First things first cut a square into the waffle and oh my f------g god. I didn't want my buddy to see how much I was enjoying it because I'm always bragging about Roscoes. The waffles were excellent, the chicken was off the chain and the grits were unmatched.   Lo-Lo's is much deserving of five stars and is just as good as Roscoes if not better. Yes I said it IF NOT BETTER. My server with the big b--ty you were perfection.",

They brought water and then didn't visit my table again for another 20 minutes to take my order. Mind you, the restaurant was not busy at all. If there is a group larger than yours at this location, don't be surprised if you're not made a priority at all. The food here is good, but the staff makes the experience a total loss. I've been to this location 3 different times, and each time I was thoroughly disappointed.",

    "text": "The first time I visited this resturant it was the central ave location in Phoenix Arizona. A friend had recommended this Resturant because of its highly regarded chicken and waffles and after  finishing my meal I can say it was totally GREAT. The chicken was fried light golden brown and not overly greasy, salted, or dark. The waffle was also light, airy, and delicious, the food and atmosphere was great AND I WAS NOT DOUBLE CHARGED FOR MY FOOD AFTER I LEFT, AS WITH THE SCOTTSDALE LOCATION. I'm not completely sure what's happening with their computer system at this particular location double charging customers but, if they want to continue to generate sales especially among the tourist that frequent their Resturant, they need to get it together when it comes to charging their customers. The consistency of presentation and taste between the two locations needs to be strongly addressed. For the most part the service and the people working there was highly acceptable and friendly, and the location was great. I feel that if they can correct the issues mentioned in this review they could remain an exceptional establishment because they do offer a great brand and product. I'm also hoping that Lo lo's management will read this review an except this customers constructive criticism and make some changes.",

    "text": "Always good food, only issue today was that our services was not up to par, my order came out 10 minutes before my fiancee food on a chipped plate, mass confusion at the server section and they had to piece together our order as everything did not come out at once and we had to remind the server about our missing items.  it seemed that there were enough people serving but no one knew what the other was doing.  I enjoy going to the Central Avenue location better as they are more personizied with the customers, here I feel like a number and not appreciated.   Word to the wise:  Before you plate any food to the public ensure that the plates, bowls are not xhopped, broken and are for the proper use. The gritels were in a bowl too small for consumption and you had to incorporate them on to the main plate.  And servers if you see that there are issues with the plates glasses, etc make a note of it to have it corrected.  Don't get me wrong the food was on point, but it was over shadowed by the service, servers and plate issue.  Our sever only came to the table to followup on when the food was placed and to deop off the check.   I informed the (whom I believe was the head server) last server that the croquettes were fried too hard and she stated that the will pass itbon and wondered if we told our server, we said no as it was hard enough with theblack of service we got, plus I felt that this was probably her first couple of weeks serving.  All in all we dealt with what we got and enjoyed the food and each other's company.",

It's very spacious and yet still feels intimate. The subtle music and open concept leading to the back patio are perfect.  The signature drink (Not yo Daddy's Olde Fashion) is my favorite. They are generously pouring the alcohol and use that same mentality in the kitchen with their huge portions which is flavorful without being overpowering.   Service can be slow at times but it's honestly well worth it.   Easily 5-stars.",

Corn bread, mac & cheese, greens, gravy, yams, & of course the waffle.  I'm seriously crying right now because there isn't a Lo Lo's in California. Roscoe's does not even come close to comparing to this place.  Cool aid on tap, how awesome is that, I had their lemonade and it was delicious.  Price was fair and service was exceptional. A small part of me dies overtime I think about Lo Lo's being 6 hours away from me.  They need to bring this baby to SoCal ASAP rocky.  How much is it to franchise? Let's make it happen captain!",

One member of our group got her food very quickly after she came later than us, which was very good in terms of service.  I ordered the Lil Amadi that came with one drumstick and one thigh of fried chicken along with one waffle.  I also got a side of mac and cheese and a piece of cornbread.  The chicken was juicy and fried to perfection!  That waffle is incredible and you have to get it when you go there!  The mac and cheese and cornbread were both excellent as well!

Our waiter Mike (tall, thin black guy) exuded such a genuine kindness and easy going attitude.  As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, I know a really good server when I see one and Mike is one of them.   Oh, and the food?  My wife had the biscuits and gravy - awesome gravy and excellent potatoes.  I had the Phat Boy and the grits with cheese add Lo-Lo's hot sauce, was great.

We delved into the banana caramel pancakes to try something new and these were wildly dense cakes with a  tasty and sticky topping and fresh fruit on top. Not sure what the batter is, but it was a nice change from normal buttermilk style. The chicken was top notch as usual and no fork is ever needed to eat these breasts. The home fries were a tad undercooked on this day, so that was the only downer. Otherwise, it was open seating at the back bar and that is usually a way to avoid the lines up front. It still irks me about how they use valet, but as I stated before, no local is ever gonna fall for that tourist trap, well at least this local. Cool bartenders also.",

However I decided to give the suburban Scottsdale location a go. Waitress saw us immediately and was very nice. I liked the look and feel of the place. I got the lo lo which is 3 pieces of chicken on two waffles. I had to get the Mac and cheese because the pictures of it look so good. The chicken was hot, juicy but a little dry and overcooked. But that was nothing that the hot sauce couldn't fix! But that chicken was definitely overcooked. I could eat that Mac n cheese all day!!!! It's soooo creamy and it's actually spiced! The seasoning throughout it is so good!!!! I recommend this place. The sweet tea is really really sweet btw so be warned!  I returned to this place and was disappointed with the broken air conditioning. It was really hot in there and the fact that the patio was open may have contributed to it. The host stand was confused about people's names and was so disorganized. Tables were left unbussed while patrons sat and sweated and waited.....and waited. The staff is a bit off and often confused. They really should get their air conditioning on point. This is July in Phoenix!!!!",

    "text": "This was my first trip to the Scottsdale location after 2 visits to the Phoenix branch. We arrived after the dinner rush (approx 7:30 pm) and was seated after a short wait.  The chairs at our table felt sticky (kinda gross). It appeared that the resturant was clearing out and our server was quick to get our drinks and appetizer. The server was nice at first. However, throughout the evening he would come to the table, leave something and walk away without saying a word. Ordered fried green tomatoes and they were ok. Nothing to write home about but did the trick. I am so glad we ordered them because our meals took another 45 minutes to get to our table. Our server had told us our food would be \"ready soon\" then he disaapeared. We flagged down a different server to inquire about our food. She explained that their computer went down and the manager was in the kitchen calling out orders. At this point there is probably about 5 other tables in the place, not busy at all. I've worked in many a kitchen and never had an issue like the kitchen printer not working slow service down that much. Plus,  if there was any issue an explanation was given to the guests. Don't leave hungry guests guessing where their food is!   Chicken and waffles were excellent (which is why they get 2 stars). Service was bad. Took them 4-5 minutes to get my son's salad to him after the rest of us were served. Another side was served 15 minutes after the meals which the server just placed on the table in silence...no apology,  no explanation.   Floor was filthy, trash and food everywhere.  Bathrooms were not much better. Hostess started cleaning the glass doors while we were finishing eating, spraying the cleaner which had a strong chemical smell. I prefer to enjoy my meals without the smell of burning plastic. But, that could just be me. There are many things that are subtle signs to guests to \"get the hell out\" of a resturant and starting nightly cleaning is one of them. (They were still open for another 45 minutes)  Good food...horrid service. I will stick to the Phoenix location from here on out.",

I ordered the catfish platter with fries & collard greens and my wife had the chicken and waffles. Fish was over battered, so for me, it was just OK, fries and cornbread were not fresh so it took away from the overall plate, The greens however, was the best on the plate. Full of flavor with a little kick. Also the Kool-Aid in the mason jar was on point....I had red-lol! Staff was helpful and pleasant and the food came out fairly quickly. It was good enough to try again when I return someday.",

Whatever happened to accommodate the customer if possible and reasonable even if the side dish were more just charge the difference, I'm not expecting them to take a financial hit.  If you go to Butterfield's they will change, upgrade or add anything to any dish, sometimes there's an upcharge which is fine. I always walk out happy!",

    "text": "First let me start out by saying I'm a sucker for chicken and for the most part on this they deliver. I have tried to call in an order after my wife and I are leaving the gym so that I can just duck in quick and grab my order rather than waiting around sweating all over the place. I was told I couldn't place an order without leaving a credit card and after explaining that I will not do that from a previous problem of having an employee of another business stealing my info and using it(nightmare). Said she couldn't even notify the kitchen without a credit card( Kitchen was right next to her phone station). said it would be a 10-15 minute wait if I came in and placed order and I could wait at bar. Not a good idea with how sweaty I was and my wife waiting in car. I placed order anyway and waited outside on a chilly night ---25 minutes later food showed up. got home --had ordered a whole rotisserie chicken and two large sides. got the two large sides but only half the chicken. oh well. I have gone in 5 times now by myself and if I get there early enough they will sit me at a table. I had to go get waitress one morning in the kitchen after I waited over 15 minutes at hostess station waiting to be seated. The gentleman outside mopping or hosing the sidewalk kept motioning me to go back to kitchen to get their attention. It was 7:10 am and it was the only time by myself I got to eat at a table. Other times, like today I walked in at 11:20. I said \"Table for one\". Reply...How about the bar? When eating Id much rather be at a table or booth. I like to order desert and coffee after my meal and be comfortable. so I said Id prefer a table or booth unless they were expecting a big rush. She said yes thanks, please have a seat at the bar( I counted once I was seated at the BAR). There were 8  tables occupied at the time out of the possible 40+ tables and booths in the place. When I left there were.....8tables occupied. This same hostess one other time approached me at the bar on another occasion that I was told by her to sit at  and said If I was parked in an unauthorized spot I would be towed away. I asked her where I was allowed to park since they share a big lot with the hotel on same property. She told me and since I had parked in an authorized area I point out my truck and she said \" Because if your towed away don't expect LoLos to pay your towing bill\". She needs to be somewhere else in this business other than greeting the cliental. Maybe she is the owner..I don't know. I have had it with this place and will be going to Paul Martins up the road when they have their delicious once a week fried chicken. Love your food LOLOs...not your attitude. I get a table every time at Paul Martins  no matter how busy or how many people in my party",

I suggest the owner pay attention to the quality of her business instead of counting her dollars and spending them Houstons Steak house.",

Maybe lunch or dinner are better but I ended up with plain French toast, which was good, but still over the top.",

    "text": "Locally owned and operated, Nice clean, bright new standalone location in Scottsdale.  Staff was friendly, welcoming, and appropriately apologetic for the insanely slow arrival of food from the kitchen, which was clearly overwhelmed on this surprisingly packed Monday night when the college kids are still gone for the holiday; Tempe appearing to be virtually dead and Scottsdale very quiet - but LoLo's big bright new location: packed.  Figuring the place must truly newly opened as in perhaps the first week or two at a brand spanking new location, and seeing my friendly host and server and the rest of the staff scrambling throughout, I made allowances and made not a complaint about the 75 minute wait for my (massive) soul food platter, but on learning this location had been open for going on 4 months, only the friendliness and apologies of the staff  - and seeing others all around me suffering similarly kept me from leaving payment for the first quart jar of sweet tea, giving up and walking out.    Half-sweet tea was just right (so you can imagine fully loaded!), and lord knows when it finally did arrive, the serving was generous: 3 LARGE pieces meaty chicken neither greasy nor dry: good!.  The collard greens nicely done and perfected with a self-administered shot of hot pepper vinegar: very good. The house mac-n-cheese rich and cheesy but barely warm on arrival; The massive sweet cornbread muffin topped with generous mound of whipped butter probably the highlight of the meal, I knew I'd be packed but was jonesing for a slice of the house special red velvet cake that I'd had long ago at the tiny old downtown location - and so saved the massive chicken breast and half the mac for tomorrow, but this was not the red velvet of old: red yes, velvet not so much. Not \"bad\" per se, but a tad on the dry side, and in the midst of the half I was eating, planning to save rest for tomorrow, there was a mildly off-putting slightly \"bitter\" flavor to a couple of bites sufficient sufficient for me not want the rest  and ask to have it taken off my bill.    I've enjoyed the old downtown Phoenix location in the past and I look forward to being able to speak similarly of this location in the future. From the packed house tonight, this location is already a success, but these fine hard working folks will need to iron out some wrinkles to maintain it.   (Note: edited 1/10/15 to correct wait time from 90 to \"only\" 75 minutes to get food).",

I also ordered a side of rice and gravy which was $4.29. This is the most expensive rice that I have ever paid for. It was not even one scoop of rice. It is like 1/2 of a scoop of rice. What kind of rice was used??? What kind of gravy was used??? Is it seasoned with gold? That price is ridiculous for a tiny side of rice. Their chicken is pretty good. I feel like their prices are just a bit pricy. Would I come back? Yeah, maybe if my friends decide to go. But for the meantime, Popeyes will do :).",

I am sure that you can judiciously pick items from the menu that will not exceed your calorie budget; but, you can eat javelina food and tofu some other day. The service was over the top. Within limits, they will serve you the best chicken & waffles you have ever eaten, the way you want it. The chicken was prepared the way that I imagined the perfectly fried chicken should be. The waffles were real waffles, round cakes crisp on the outside and light and airy inside and slightly sweet. The gravy, I asked for it on the side, was spicy with strips of onion; perfect for dipping chicken into. Next time I will try spreading gravy on waffles. Lo-Lo's is a few blocks from Scottsdale Stadium. Just about the perfect combination: baseball and Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.",

    "text": "After finally tasting Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles together, I thought, \"These waffles are fantastic, and how on earth did I ever eat waffles without chicken before?\" They're topped with a big dollop of creamy butter and a small glass of warm syrup ...maybe 2 to 3 ounces. (I have no idea; it's not like I'm paying attention as I'm pouring it all over.)  If you want a breakfast \"done right,\" served anytime, they've got everything from an \"egg white veggie omelet\" to \"chocolate, caramel, candied walnut french toast\"...everything from eggs, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, amazing biscuits & more to Oreo or Pineapple Upside Down pancakes, etc. You get the idea.   Some things on the menu are almost too sweet though (in my opinion) like their Red Velvet pancakes with Cream Cheese Icing. It could easily feed two people as a \"dessert.\"  I give the Chicken Fingers and Mac & Cheese two thumbs up. I like the \"Phat Azz Samich\" (chicken) and love the Hood Burger (which should be called a Phat Azz Burger). I've never had their fish, shrimp, or chili, but I would imagine that they probably have those nailed as well.  Grits are something that I think \"you either like or you don't,\" but I think that they are amazing with their huge scoop of butter on them. Add the syrup, and they taste like caramel corn!   As far as \"Dranks,\" they have everything from Southern, Sugar-Coma Kool-Aid and Sweet Tea (in huge Mason jars) to Mixed drinks, like: Melon Mojitos, Mimosas, Margaritas, Cherry Martinis...and that's just the \"M\" list. I haven't tried them all, haha, but the \"Georgia On My Mind\" is great. Speaking of the bar, it's not a \"hang out at a bar\" kind of area; it's an \"eat out back, under a roof, and enjoy the weather\" area. And they DO have beer, wine, milk, Voss water, FRESH OJ, awesome homemade lemonade, etc., just no Dr. Pepper. What's up with that, Lolo? (They have Pepsi products.)   The service is pretty fast considering the volume of items made to order, and every server we've had has been super fun, friendly & efficient. Plus, there's so much to check out with the decor. It's a cool place!  It starts getting packed at 7 p.m. most nights, so my advise is to make it there by 6:30, as they do not take reservations, and the parking lot is usually full. I actually know people who have parked in the adjacent hotel's spots.",

This place did not sacrifice their growth for quality either.    Lo-Lo's gets it right and I love their menu! So many options to choose from and the names of their dishes are hilarious.    The chicken is juicy and flavorful, the waffles are decent (not as fluffy as I like but good enough) and they make they don't serve their chicken and waffles with chicken tenders (my biggest pet peeve). Thank you for serving quality thighs, wings,and breasts with your waffles LoLo's because that is how this meal is meant to be!  Oh ya, they carry their own hot sauce.  Reminds me of Crystal or Louisiana Sauce and is a must on the chicken if you want to do it right!  After my first few bites you sent me straight back to the South.  I felt like I was in grandma's kitchen.  You guys are right on par with my favorite chicken and waffle spot of all time (The Breakfast Klub in Houston, TX) and that says a lot.",

I'm not a huge fan of waffles but I am SO GLAD I did. The waffle and warm syrup were to die for and a great accompaniment to my 2 delicious pieces of chicken.   We also got a side of mac and cheese to split. It was really tasty too. Overall this was a great experience and the prices were very reasonable. I wish they had a location close to home!",

Then our excellent waitress recommended some of her favorites which turned out to be spot on!  I'm local but had not been to this location and I was also elated. It took awhile to receive our food but my Cuzzies said no real comfort food is prepared \"fast\". It was well worth the wait while having cocktails and listening to the music. A gentleman who I assumed was the manager or owner brought us our \"koolaid\" , that's right koolaid and dared us to sip it  and not like it. He was right the back in the day surprise was delicious.

Then my meal arrived and it looked tasty, but I was wrong.  It was delicious.  Not only did this place have food that is acceptable to my dietary requirements, but they offered awesome music.

The host looked at us continuously, went to the back, and came back to the host stand not once.. but MULTIPLE times. Giving us False hope that we would get some sort of service soon. He could've at least taken our drink order. We got up and left. Out of curiosity, we called the store and put in a ToGo order to see how long it would take and the woman on the phone said 10 minutes. The fact that a ToGo order gave us service and not an actual server within that time is ridiculous. Usually this place is great with service but not today.",

    "text": "I'm struggling with the rating on this one... I'm feeling 1-2 stars for its blatant mockery of real, down home southern cooking, which peeves me to my core, and them having the audacity to overcharge for this.  But then I feel like maybe they should get 3 stars for the menu options (which include a veggie platter), nice atmosphere, and good service, which we typically receive, especially since they've moved to this location.  I keep seeing these 4 & 5 star reviews with praises of the awesome southern cooking and/or soul food.  In the words of Inigo Montoya, \"You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.\"    I'm thinking that the majority of you aren't from the south, so you have nothing to which you can compare your \"southern\" experience.  I've come to the conclusion that this place is for you people.  I look at you the same way that my Mexican friends look at me when I eat Taco Bell and call it \"Mexican\" food.    Alas, I do not eat meat, so my experience is as a vegan, therefore, in fairness, I'll stick with 3-stars and move on.  Food: What I do really like here is that they do NOT use animal products in their greens and string beans; these side items are completely vegan-friendly.  This is very rare (non-existent) with southern-style cooking, which typically uses ham or turkey as a flavoring for vegetables (especially greens, string beans, beans, black-eyed peas, etc).   They offer a Veggie Platter, which comes with your choice of 4 sides and a corn bread muffin (which is vegetarian, but not vegan).  The following are some of the vegan-friendly sides for the veggie platter.   COLLARD GREENS: hit or miss.  They never taste completely fresh, but sometimes they're ok with the help of the hot sauce.  Other times they're like flavorless Glory greens.  You can have amazing southern greens without meat.  I don't cook, but I can make some mean, meatless, mamma-jamma greens, so there is just no excuse.   STRING BEANS & RED POTATOES: *rolls eyes* Child please. One time, only once, did I get a fresh batch of green beans, and I'm convinced that it must have been because they ran out of cans and had to resort to fresh ones.  All other times? Straight-from-the-can tasting green beans, also seriously lacking in flavor. I kick myself every time I give them another try.  SAUTEED SPINACH: Pretty darn tasty and fresh!  Whatever seasoning is used on the spinach needs to be shared with the rest of the green veg family. Sharing is caring.   HOME FRIES: Ok, these are bomb! They are triangular chunks of skin-on potatoes seasoned with their amazing seasoning, and cooked with red & green peppers and onions. So good!  Sometimes I get a double order.   FRENCH FRIES: Basically, their bomb seasoning transforms these fries from boring to superstar status. (Maybe they should try this seasoning on the other vegetables?)  Other items I've tried after being annoyed by the greens and green beans...  BEANS OVER RICE and FRIED OKRA: The beans & rice are what I call, Red Beans and Rice, but theirs is without the southern appeal.   Both of these dishes are bland, bland, bland.  I swear, if I shake my head any harder, it may swivel off its hinges.  The beans and rice could use a vegetable based broth, and the okra just needs seasoning.  There are no vegan desserts; vegetarian, yes, but vegan, no.   My DD usually gets either the Chicken Tender Basket or Chicken and Waffles.  She says their fried chicken is almost as good as Sweetie Pies, back home, so that's saying something.  She said the waffles are just ok, and that if you like doughy waffles then you wouldn't like these.  They've expanded their menu and added items like Spicy Corn Fritters, Fried Green Beans, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Catfish Beignets, all of which my DD says are delish.  (I am waiting on confirmation from management as to if the fried veggies are vegan-friendly.)  They fact that they changed their menu indicates that they are open to change, which is a great thing.  Maybe there is hope for better tasting greens and string beans in the future.   I really like this new location and the set up.  It still gets crazy crowded, and if a booth isn't available you're stuck at tables that are really close to other patrons, which I don't like.  (I always wait on a booth.)  But service has always been really good for us.  There's a set of twins (I can't tell them apart) who are excellent servers with great personalities.   All in all, I like the concept: bringing southern food favorites to the southwest.  The \"Hood Classics\" and Kool-Aid are funny and nice touches to the theme. And I love that there are people from all backgrounds who come here and enjoy the food.  But I'm assuming that in their desperation to keep up with the demand of the large crowds, the real southern-tasting soul food was lost along the way.  Luckily, the masses don't know the difference so they should be able to keep this charade up for the long-run.",

With upgrades, renovations and now this new location in Scottsdale, Lolo's has become my go-to for out-of-town guests who come to visit Phoenix!  This Scottsdale location is definitely bigger and much more accommodating - all while extending their menu but still managing to keep the original items that never disappoint!  I always get the Tre Tre (2 drumsticks and a waffle) and a Red Kool-Aid.  Their drinks are served in huge Mason jars and Kool-Aid is ordered by color (Red, Blue, etc.).  One must try the Fried Gizzards!    Anyway, this location also offers a nice patio but the only downfall for myself would be the parking.  It is valet only and there are signs from the hotel (they share the parking lot) everywhere that say that parking is for hotel guests only.  So, just abide by those rules or park across the street near the BoA (who wants to do that when it's 110 outside?!)... just valet it!",

    "text": "I really had high hopes for this place as I have heard lots of great things but I was really disappointed. The hostess had such an attitude and chip on her shoulder. She didn't crack a smile, and hardly spoke to us. First impression fail here! Our server was friendly and seemed knowledgeable. We had a large party and he kept on top of things and overall did a great job.   Now some things that bothered me... the hair in the salt in the salt shaker was disgusting! I should have complained but just let it slide. The music was so loud and awful! It was religious gospel sounding music and everyone in our party agreed it was horrible, way to loud and unnecessary. It literally drove us out of the restaurant, most of our party just got up and walked out leaving a few of us to finish. Driving guests out, based on your music, doesn't seem like a smart way to run a business if you ask me.   On to the food... the sweet tea was so amazing! Kool Aid on tap was a nice treat for the kiddos too! The food was really tasty! Everyone was really pleased with his/her food at our table. The biscuits and gravy were killer and massive! Only problem was there was enough gravy on the plate for the two massive biscuits, everyone at our table that ordered it had to ask for more gravy. The waffles were delicious as was the fried chicken.   I honestly do not know if we would return but if we do we hope the hostesses are friendlier, the music is low and the salt/pepper shakers are free of hairs.",

The macaroni and cheese seemed like It sat a long time in the container and did not taste good at all.  The banana pudding was overly sweet. I wonder if they accidentally added double the sugar.  The waffles were decent.  I ate less than a quarter of my meal before I felt sick to my stomach so I threw it away.  $30 something dollars for this?! I will not be going here again.",

First, they didn't even know who the waiter was and two different people asked for our drinks, they didn't greet our table and introduce themselves, they just asked what we wanted to drink with an attitude, then right after our waiter came and asked us for our drinks. Once he asked us for our food he didn't have any knowledge for the menu what so ever. He didn't ask me what I wanted for my side. Once we got our food it was so skimpy..I got the fish and chips and it had one tiny piece of fish, barely any fries and it was cold. For 12 dollars. My boyfriend for chicken and waffles, the waffle tasted like it was out of a bag and in a microwave, the chicken was just bone..two bites of chicken and he found a hair on it. The music was terrible and the service was even worse. I don't usually complain because I work in the restaurant business but it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I still tipped 15% strictly for the fact that I am a waiter and I understand not getting tipped is not ideal.  If I could give this 0 stars, I would.",

The most recent time the server took forever to approach us, did not check on us once, and forgot one of our ordered items. While I want to like the food, each time I have been less than impressed.

Also the valet parking is free, but the location does hurt the expected dining experience.  Probably will go back, but with more realistic expectations.",

    "text": "They just opened this one not too long ago and I have already fell in love with this place. Of course the name and thought of mixing chicken and waffles isn't something that may sound appetizing but boy was I wrong. Not only was their signature dish, chicken and waffles delicious. Every plate that I have ever ordered has been really good, the meat has always been cooked to perfection and their drinks are really good! Especially the mimosas! Huge drinks by the way, ordered a cranberry juice and was surprised at how big it was. The prices are pretty low for such good food and the costumer service is pretty well also. I've never had an issue with the staff, in fact they remembered me the last time I went in which says a lot about the staff and how the restaurant manages. I like to sit on the outside patio, the seating is really comfortable and they have heaters in case it gets chilly. Plus they have huge television screens in front of the bar, which is always a plus. Definitely (if not already) going to be a regular. Try the fried mushrooms too!",

Their waffles are the Spinkles cupcake version of waffles--delicious and dense--never had a better waffle in my life. The chicken was out of this world--and we are from the deep south!  The rice and beans were a gourmet take on a favorite--addictive! The Collard greens has a nice spicy bite to them that made us go back for seconds. OH! The CORNBREAD!!  TO DIE FOR!    Everything was excellent--hot, served with such love and professionalism--the staff was AMAZING!!  We fell in love with these terrific gentlemen--kind, passionate about their food and so very hospitable!  One of the best catered events I have ever attended!!!",

Good news, he apologized and brought me two slightly larger bone dry breasts. If sensational Mac and cheese and great corn bread and homemade lemonade are worth 23 dollars (a la  carte menu gets you every time), they should just take the chicken off the menu and just call it LoLo's Very Expensive Mac 'N Cheese Restaurant.",

I called the restaurant prior to coming to see if there was a wait and I was informed that it wasn't, however when we arrived at the restaurant it was a wait. I was quoted about 20 mins, but we were seated about 5 mins or less after arriving. Major kudos to the staff for that! This location is a nice size with a really chill/fun vibe. There was a DJ, check out my photos, this made the experience really fun. He played some old school jamz and new school hits. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. It did take a little long for our food to come out, I'm guessing this was due to the restaurant being really busy when we were seated. I noticed after the crowd kind of died down, people that came in after us and ordered got their meals right away.   The food was excellent. I had the breast and waffle (so so good) and also got a chance to taste the catfish bites (so so yummy), the mac n cheese (really cheesy), and red beans n rice (very tasty). My favorite dishes were the waffles and cat fish bites. The fried chicken was hot and fresh and good, but nothing really spectacular. If I ever come back I will defintely be ordering two waffles, yes they are not that big and yes I am probably considered greedy, and the cat fish bites. I defintely recommend Lo-Lo's and whenever I have the chance to come back to the Arizona I will have at least one meal at Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.",

    "text": "Love Lo Lo's and have been dining with them for a long time when they were in their original location before they upgraded the new downtown location and expanded to the 2nd location in Scottsdale.   Tonight's experience was a little disappointing with the entire experience. First, Do not like the valet parking, the server was kidding but did not care for his sense of humor and most of all the Waffles and syrup was way below par.  The waffles were not as firm as would like, they were under cooked and almost soggy but the most disappointing thing was the obvious watering down of the syrup where there was hardly any syrup taste and no substance where it was the thickness of water.  When I asked the server what type of chicken I could get, he said \"fried\" in a smart a$$ way which pissed me off because I did not want white meat and just wanted to assure that I could get dark meat. Bruce then started to go on how he loved his job which I did not get the impression that he did.  The last item I did not care for was the valet which our car was parked right by the door, the valet asked me if I just wanted to pull it out myself and I said sure, but when I went to get in the other valet car was parked so close there was no way I could even open the door. Was not happy to see the other car parked so close and I tried to check if there were any scratches or dents but it was too dark.  Let me give Lo Lo's some feedback, your new restaurants are beautiful and impressive but your food is not living up to where it used to be, I would rather have the ghetto buildings and great quality food than the Foo Foo new nice buildings and the crap food and service that you have now.",

On the Kk it clearly states onions and cheese on the grits. I noticed before I left because I have learned to check my order before I leave. Brought it back in and they realized the mistake and only put cheese on them. So even though I fully explained everything still wasn't as stated on the menu even though I went back in.   A time before this one they forgot my egges. And the grits had nothing on them. They need managers that watch everything. Because I have not gotten multiple items in all the times I've gone.   All this could be forgotten it it wasn't for my biggest gripe about lolos. That is that the grits are the most unflavored thing I have ever had. It tastes like they don't even cook them with salt. There's multiple things they could do to make them better but they haven't in the years I have been going. Everything there is pretty great but this is the one item that is a complete waste of space on the menu. Throw some butter, salt, chicken stock something! In those grits.   Check your order if you go. Get that red velvet cake.",

The chicken was exceptionally crisp on the outside, moist on the inside. The waffle was good. It wasn't the best waffle I've had but paired well with the chicken.   The bad: Woof. The service. I went midday on a Saturday and they were certainly busy. Waited up front for about 10 minutes before a host showed up. Seated at the bar, took about another 5 to even get noticed. I somehow got my food before I ever got my drink (a tea). They seem to be fairly understaffed. I think the lady at the bar gave me the menu, took my order, and the check. Not much else. Which is fine but had I actually needed anything it would have been a task. Saw multiple folks at the bar not getting service.   Overall, if you have time to wait it out, really good food but don't expect to be in and out.",

Soon as I walked in with my group, we were quickly seated. Alfonso was our server and man did he come through. I'm one of those people that would get a few things they wanna try but then get stuck on choosing. Alfonso allowed me to go down my list and helped me to choose the perfect meal.   I appreciated his honesty and got the mix 2 on which I got Catfish  ( yes boo, Catfish not Swai nonsense ) #SouthernBred ! I paired it with the mac n cheese ( creamy and seasoned ) along with the whipped potatoes ( thick, fresh, and well seasoned ). This was all paired with s glass of lemonade that was the perfect blend of tart and sweet. I've never been a kook aid drinker but this place is known for it!   I was a tad bit frustrated as it wasn't as busy and I requested tarter sauce... I figured I would be offered that or even ketchup cause who wants dried fish. I honestly would've settled for lemons! It too 3 servers ( 1 being the host ) to bring me tarter sauce 10 mins later. By then the other parties were already done with food.   Alfonso saved the day by bringing tarter sauce, lemons, a Togo box and a small to go cup with lemonade. All in all, not a bad first time and I will be trying the one in Vegas to see if the experience is consistent!",

My wife decided to stop here for lunch as we've romanced the idea for years. The restaurant is spacious and clean. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Started off with some green apple Kool-Aid which was just like the Kool-Aid you'd have as a kid. We ordered the fried okra appetizer which was tasty, accompanied by a rich buttermilk ranch dipping sauce.  For entrees I ordered the red velvet pancakes which was good. But the highlight of the meal was my wife's \"Lo-Lo's\" plate: 3 pieces of fried chicken and two large waffles. The chicken was crisp on the outside and tender and tasty on the inside. The waffles were amazing and had a rich flavor that we never have had in a waffle before. I basically abandoned the red velvet pancakes and my wife and I shared the chicken and waffles. It was delicious. We'll be back again for certain!",

Dirty plates a glasses littered the bar top and the place was a little busy so I thought I was having patients. but no acknowledgement for 10 minutes while I watched several people behind the bar Serving NO purpose. They seemed to be spinning in circles, not pouring, not selling not, clearing the bar top. When I was finally approached, the young lady was not welcoming nor apologetic or even pleasant.  It was when I pushed the empty glasses away from me towards the bar that she snapped at me \"let me do my job\" wow!! I would, but she couldn't! Another 5 minutes passed before the 2 beers ordered were delivered. I made immediate payment because I no longer wanted to eat at LoLos.  That bartender walked around the bar doing not much with my 20 dollar bill clutched in her hand  for at least 5 minutes. We went over to Oregano's and service was better then spot on. Im still in a bit of shock as to how uncomfortable I was at LoLos today.",

I got the red velvet pancakes, and it was the driest tasteless pancakes i've ever had. The cream cheese sauce was barely put on, and maple syrup made it taste off. For $15 I could of gone to Dennys or iHop, and honestly got better pancakes there. The service was pretty great, and the waiter was very nice, but the food was super mediocre. I could maybe try the original location, but for $15 a plate I can't find it to be worth it. Go to iHop, or better yet the Original Pancake House, which has a lot better of pancakes in the Scottsdale/North Phoenix area.",

Maybe I will try something different but I ordered the Lolo's Fish and Chips.  The piece of cod was well cooked and large, the fries hot and seasoned well.  However the coating was cornmeal.  Some may like cornmeal but it is not my favorite, I like beer batter or a light crispy panko or bread crumb.  They were very busy and the one thing that was challenging was parking. The restaurant is on the same corner/parking lot and you can only park in a few areas for restaurant only if you are not staying at the hotel on property.  The lunch crowd was very busy and servers were running and at times you couldn't find your server.  Oh and the fish did not come with tartar, had to ask.  Overall, just an \"okay\" experience.",

I did like their wings, I would order them again. Sides I tried are sauteed spinach, mushroom and onions, and their French fries.

No recommendations from the waitress as we stated we was from out of town and it was our first time. Our order included red velvet pancakes and hot links, cookies and cream pancakes , stupid azz fries and a veggie plate ( greens, rice and gravy, yams and home potatoes). The chicken on the stupid fries was overlooked and dry. The yams had so much nutmeg and cinnamon I couldn't eat them and the rice was undercooked and hard. The greens were good. The home fries are literally fried potatoes with onions and bell peppers threw on top. For the price you pay I was very disappointed. However, per the other guests at the table their pancakes were awesome. We visited about 11:30am or so. The place was clean. The music was good. My score is based on the food and service. Not sure I would go back to the location in Scottsdale.",

I asked for a breakfast plate and I asked if they could put some spinach in my eggs. Not a side of spinach. Apparently there was a $4.29 upcharge for it and she neglected to tell me and when I asked her about it felt her give me a little attitude like \"yea that's how much it cost\".   The eggs weren't cooked the way I ordered them anyway.   When she came with our food she spilled ketchup on the floor right next to my friend which it spilled on my friends dress and Marky didn't seem to think she had to clean it up from off the floor.    When she finally came back to the table. I gave her a $50 bill  for my meal and my change turned out to be $20.20. Marky gave me the $20 back but neglected to give me the .20 with it. Not a big deal but it's the principle. If it says that exact change on the receipt that's what I expect as any other customer would",

Our waitress Danielle is what made the experience honestly. She gave great recommendations and helped us choose what to get and actually gave us her honest opinion of the food.   I got the sausage gravy with eggs and potatoes, my boyfriend had the three piece chicken and waffle meal and we shared an Oreo pancake. Oh! And their sweet tea and kool-aid is where its at!   My gravy came out cold as well as my potatoes. Since I'm in the service industry I hate complaining but its bs that my food was cold so I asked her to just heat the gravy back up and id deal with the rest. I was too hungry to wait for my food to be re cooked. So, she came back with the gravy (still not even hot) BUT about two minutes later Danielle brings me fresh steaming hot potatoes without me even asking for them. NOW THATS SERVICE. The chicken my boyfriend demolished and the waffles were frekking awesome. Not to mention that Oreo pancake alone I will come back for.   Idk If the kitchen was in the weeds or if my plate had just been sitting in the window or what but sending out cold food is the worst thing in my opinion.   Will be back to sit in Danielle's section, for sure. Kuddos to you! :)",

I've gone to eat here multiple times and have had outstanding customer service each time. The servers are extremely friendly and created a very inviting atmosphere. As for the food, it is the most flavorful and succulent chicken I have ever eaten. The waffles taste almost like a churro and compliments the chicken very well when eaten together. I've also tried the Mac n cheese which is very rich but delicious. Another must have is the kool-aid. Served in a decorative mason jar it is the perfect beverage to cool down and enjoy! I highly recommend trying out Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!",

The parking situation is just stupid.  They share a parking lot with a hotel and very few spots were available to the restaurant.  They offered complimentary valet parking but at 5:00 on a Sunday evening they were shutting that down.   My husband & I were shown to our table quickly which surprised me and then we sat and waited.  If you don't want alcohol or their famous Kool-aid your left with unfiltered tap water. Any one from Arizona knows that tap water is just plain nasty. We placed our orders and waited some more.... an hour into it I was wondering if they would ever feed us when my husband's chili and my two side choices finally showed up.  We waited... We asked and were told husband's fries and my chicken would be right out. We waited... Husband ate his chili and my beens and gravy got cold. I sent them back. The server apologized and said our food would be right out. Husband's fries showed up. My sides showed up, again, had to ask for the chicken and waffle again, and then I had to ask for syrup.  The chicken breast was all skin, fat and bone I got 3 bites. The gravy was nasty but the beans were good. Husband said his chili was good and the flavor of the fries covered the nasty tasting water. We complained to the manager about how disappointing the whole experience was and he apologized while making excuses that when you come to Lo Lo's a long wait is expected I said we would be going to the Gilbert location from now on and the manager said \"Oh that location is even worse\" Really?  Great endorsement.    Parking is a mess, food sucked, staff helpless, management is a joke.",

It is amazing! We also really enjoy the cornbread (huge, moist and actual corn in it), the Mac and cheese, and the spicy corn fritters. They have many great drink options as well. The Georgia drink and even the lemonade and sweet teas are great. I like asking for an Arnold Palmer. The waffles, catfish, grits, fried green tomatoes and greens are all lacking flavor and we would not try those again.  Looking forward to when the new  Gilbert location gets it's act together, as it is much closer and we would like to try something new at LoLo's. Definitely worth a visit!",

The parking situation was a mess with the only real option to use the valet service which was free. I didn't really want to use it considering I was just going to be there for a short time but it would be good for someone dining in.   On to the food. The waffles were pretty good but the chicken lacked seasoning both times that I had it. The chicken itself was cooked well but it just didn't have much of a taste. With better tasting chicken this place would be fantastic.",

    "text": "I have been a patron here for over five years, since before they moved to Scottsdale. I would drive down to PHX to eat their food at their previous location.  Good, solid soul food here. A bit over priced, but they have to pay the rent and the bills for their location. I have yet to try the gizzards, but I've had pretty much everything else on the menu.  Sometimes the fried foods are over-fried. Otherwise you will have a good fried food experience here.   You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   This place takes the experience which I would previously have to drive to South Central LA to obtain, accessible to those who would otherwise not have that opportunity. In other words, it brings black people's food to white people, in a location and format that is acceptable to them.   The system seems to be working with good success.  My advice if you've never been here before: avoid the chicken and waffles, and try something a bit more gritty and culinarily adventurous",

Ambience is kinda sports bar/ hooters hip hop chain restaurant trying too hard to be hipster but also trying to appeal to the family diners. Chicken is well fried but lacks a little spice or kick. Waffle was too thin and limp to hold up to the chicken. Cole slaw was tangy and vinegary- was legit.  Overall a tasty meal, but not worth standing in line for.",

Parking is a challenge as noted in other reviews, but valet a solution so moving forward.  Overall good just as good, service slower.  Loved music even though it was hard to hear.  Lots going on with TVs.  Loved the community table!  Today we ordered shrimp and grits, Chyna wings, and caramel banana pancake.  Also indulged in an Arnold Palmer and Purple kool aid.  Got an order of sock it 2 me cake to go.  Huge homemade biscuit with shrimp and grits was a pleasant surprise.  Shrimp and grits lacked the sauce that is typical of the item.  This item is the only reason that the review was not 5 stars.  Wish I had ordered gravy for the biscuit.    Caramel banana pancake was on point.   Wow!  Wings were perfect blend of sweet and spiciness, could have an option for a smaller portion with a side because just too much for one person.  Drinks are just like the good ole days, a treat once and a while but certainly not an everyday splurge for indulging.  Service not as speedy so be prepared, but food worth the wait.",

After being seated by the hostess, our waitress brought our party water, took our order, and gave us a single refill.   In the following hour, not once did our original waitress stop and consult us about the status of our order. Multiple times she strided by and paid our table no attention. After waiting for over an hour and watching various parties, who were seated after our own group, receive their orders, our party walked out. Not a single employ asked why we were walking out.  I've had bad restaurant experiences from servers, hosts, and other employees before. The expectation, even at the worst of establishments, would see that your food would be served to you. Lolos in Scottsdale could not even meet the lowest bar of expectation",

By the time we arrived, everyone in my party was already seated and had ordered/eaten. They pulled another table over so we could all sit together as a group.  I noticed the entrees were sizable. Since my aunt had more than half of her shrimp and grits entree left, I just ended up eating part of her meal.  I've never had shrimp and grits prepared in that fashion (the shrimp were fried and the tails left on) but it was pretty good.  My husband ended up ordering the chicken and waffles - this came with 3 big pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. Unfortunately the chicken was a little dry, but the waffles were good.  He also had scrambled eggs and bacon. He did not finish his meal since it was a lot of food, and he opted not to take the leftover piece of fried chicken to-go since it wasn't that great.    We also ordered an appetizer of catfish which I thought was good.  Service was slow but pleasant nevertheless. I asked for water with no lemon, she came back with water with lemon.  I requested again and gave back the water.  This time she came back with the same cup, the lemon was gone but there was lemon visibly floating around in the cup.  I don't like to send things back (especially after asking twice) so my husband ordered another water with no lemon, then he took my glass and drank some.  He confirmed he could taste the lemon.  Silverware was not particularly clean, nor was the place that clean looking while I was there (food remnants on floor, chairs, etc).  Overall a decent meal.",

The food is wonderful, juicy chicken and perfectly fluffy waffles - and of course I always have to get a side of mac & cheese. Even the Kool-Aid is fantastic, and thank goodness for free refills because I'll easily go through at least 3 glasses of it. The service is excellent and always friendly, and overall we are never disappointed!  The only complaints I've ever had, albeit minor ones, is that sometimes the mac & cheese comes out a bit cold - like they just scoop it out of a big pot that's been sitting out for a while and isn't warm anymore. The taste is still good, so not the end of the world. And a couple times when it's been busy the servers get shuffled around a bunch so we might need to give our order twice and one time they forgot an extra waffle my boyfriend ordered, though it was quickly fixed. Still one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I need delicious and satisfying food!",

    "text": "Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles continues to impress me! I ate in the Scottsdale location a few years ago, before they moved up Scottsdale Road to their new digs at Drinkwater Blvd. You gotta love the character and atmosphere inside each Lo-Lo's! And that aroma!  I still prefer to visit the downtown location on Central, but I've reviewed that one separately. And this location is slightly closer to my office. Both locations still manage to fill up at lunch time, very quickly.  The lunch crew tried to arrive early, but that was thwarted at the office. Still, we were seated quickly. And we ordered our drinks and food together. It took a while for the food to arrive, but that's not unusual at a Lo-Lo's when they are busy. And it was a Friday. We were relaxed and enjoying the last opportunity to sit on the patio during the lunch hour.  The food was outstanding! Again, no surprise here. Most of my co-workers tried my favorite Biscuits and Gravy. I wanted something different. Who knew Fried Catfish went so well with a fresh waffle? Lo-lo's knew! That's why \"D. Mann\" is on the menu. And the Sweet Tea is an excellent drink on a warm, late spring day.  Our server Patricia did a nice job of keeping things moving quickly, splitting the check and being there when needed. Thank you Patricia and thank you Lo-Lo's!",

I ended up getting the Mix and Match meal, a breast of chicken and catfish along with collards and Mac with cheese.  Delicious. The fish was fried hard enough that it didn't break into a million pieces and the breast was moist. I'm definitely hard on Mac with cheese from restaurants, but theirs was pretty tasty. Now the collards were probably my favorite. Very impressed! The serve kool-aid and it was pretty tasty as well. I had the tropical punch and lemonade mix. I'd definitely recommend Lo-Lo's",

The waitress took our order and brought our drinks in a timely matter.  As my son picked up the large mason jar water glass to take a drink the bottom fell completely off. All the water landed on him and some landed on the table and splashed in his face. We are very lucky he was not cut by the jagged glass that broke off. My son was drenched in cold ice water. He drove home and changed clothes as we just waited for him at the restaurant. I want to mention it was 40 degrees out side.  The waitress was very apologetic and moved us to a dry table. My son came back, we ate our meal and was expecting at the  least my sons meal to be comped. No comp No discount. We felt Lo-Lo's didn't care about the huge inconvenience they caused. Shame on you Lo-Lo's.",

When I first moved to Phoenix and they were downtown off a side street, then when they moved into the spot off Thomas and Scottsdale, and now their very fancy space after franchising off Thomas and Osborn.  The ambiance will never be the same. Their old old location reminded me of the backyard fish fry in Georgia....kinda dirty but always good and greasy. He'll, now they offer \"healthy\" options. I treated myself to their fried catfish plate. It came with 2 sides. The catfish is light and flaky and their batter is just plain ass great. It's like a mix of cornmeal and flour...slightly salty but I like it like that. Dabble some of that hot sauce on there and you've got the perfect meal for a fish fry. But then there's the sides. I had the greens which I love but rarely cook because they take so long. Their greens are a little more al dente....not crunchy but definitely not soggy like I'm use to. I thought they were great the way they prepared them. Then the cheese grits. No lumps...just smooth with sprinkled cheese and butter, the way cheese grits are supposed to be cooked.  The server was sweet as peaches and talked me into some banana pudding. I like it but it needed more  wafers.  Service was wonderful. Considering everything I ordered is poor man's food...it was a bit expensive...I mean catfish, collards, grits....put you back maybe 5 bucks? But I would pay again for this little slice of soul food again.",

I ordered the baby ray and my fiancee got the lo-los we also got a side of Mac and cheese as well as cheesy grits. Our server was fantastic as was the waffles and the chicken.  The four stars is because the sides were very bland, and even though the chicken was good, the baby Ray chicken got a little more soggy than I expected because of the gravy. If this was just based on the service, it would be 5 stars, they offered drink refills whenever I was low, they answered all my questions and best of all no wait. All in all a great meal, and I will be back, I just wouldn't recommend the baby ray.",

They have a consistent brand, good environment, great staff, and the food is obviously amazing.   I usually get the Betty Boop and that is plenty of food for me. Their hot sauce they have is made in house and so is their maple syrup. The butter is always on point.   I like the ambience here because it is modern, family oriented, nostalgic, and a homey feel when I come in. It's a great location with plenty of space for large groups. I love he mason jar theme in the chandeliers and you drink big jars of red kool-aid. They have a special drink list that is phenomenal too. The old fashion is done right.   They have good music and again a chill atmosphere. It is the best chicken n waffle I've ever had. I promise you, if you want that and more you have to check this out.",

I don't even have enough words to say how yummy everything was. Thanks again Lo Lo's for a perfect meal.   December 15:  The worst experience here today. I almost got up and left. We sat and waited for about an hour for our food before we were told that the waffle irons were not functioning properly. I asked if we could just have our chicken and was told no because if we were brought ours before the other people who had been waiting it wouldn't be fair. So you're telling me we could all have been served our chicken until you got the waffle issue settled? I'm beyond upset at this point. Oh BTW, we had to ask what the problem was. No one had offered that information to us. So we were offered corn bread to appease our empty stomachs and then I guess they finally decided to give us all our chicken orders. The waffles did finally come but what is usually a great time at LoLo's turned into not so pleasant. I'm not sure I'm coming back to this location. Probably stick to going downtown to the original location.",

The restaurant shares a parking lot with the hotel and there were very limited spots, so you have to use the valet service.  The restaurant inside looks like a fox concept.  It definitely looks more like a chain which I didn't expect.  We both ordered the soul food special, 3 pieces of chicken, two sides, and corn bread.  Verdict?  The chicken - all dark meat -- was dry, the skin was crispy to the point that it was hard, and the meat lacked flavor.  Very disappointing.  Honesty, would have had better chicken at Popeye's, Church's, or KFC.  Sides were good, corn bread was flavorful, and service was great.  Main ingredient - fail.",

I got there and they had a 15 minute wait, which is fine, but they proceeded to sit a couple who had come in after, before they even sat us. I asked the hostess about it and she apologized. So we get seated and it's a good five minutes before anyone comes and greets us. She takes our drink order, drops them off and disappears. I waited 15 minutes before I called over a different waitress to see if she could take our order. My original waitress is off taking care of everyone and never bothers to come back until well after we've received our food.  Love the food but after two bad experiences, I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "There is no doubt your chicken and waflle combo is good and when you serve good food, expect your customers to recommend your resto to our friends. And, when I say FRIENDS... that means A LOT! Like a party of 20. Last October 25th, our party of 20 arrived around 2030 to have a late dinner, we really didnt expect to be seated right away since our group was huge. We waited around 20-25 mins which wasnt too bad since the place was busy that night. Then came our server... my friends told him right away that we would be paying separately (5 tabs for 5 families) so he wouldnt be too confused with taking our orders and billing us. Instead, he brushed us off and insisted to remain on our seats and get our orders ONE BY ONE. We questioned this method since we had our young kids with us and we prefer that we order for them and we tend to share our platter among us. My husband and I didnt like his tone, it was like he was talking down on us, he kept on saying, \"Listen up, listen up!\" as if we were his subordinates. We waited another 20 mins for our drinks and once we got our drinks, another 20 mins for them to get our orders. That our kids have finished their drinks even before they got our food order. When the food came out, there was even more chaos because no one could really remember who ordered what probably because we were all too hungry! While eating, what did our beloved server do? Of course, he had to ask us once again who ordered what and under whose tab since he didnt take our suggestion in the first place!  I am not really questioning the quality of your food, just the system you have when you are faced with a large group of customers. Hopefully, by the time you open in Gilbert (where we live), you have ironed out your system already. Love the new place, btw, very modern. Although the old place was more home-y.   We are giving you another chance, Lo-lo's!!!",

This is wonderful fried chicken and comes out HOT! I usually take home some of this because it's a LOT to eat for $15.  The only negative thing I can say about this place is the parking is horrible! They make you park with a valet, yest it's free, but who wants someone else/stranger to drive your car. Not me! So I park across the street. Also, the Red Velvet cake is delicious!!!!  Go there! It's worth getting to the airport early to eat at that location too!",

Our server was Alexis and I can't remember the other girls name (Megan?). I ordered the fried chicken sandwich because in the menu it had said something about it winning \"Arizona's Best\" vote or something to that effect. Normally I would go for the fried chicken and waffles or their Honey Hot wings which are killer but I was feeling lucky. I believe I heard a live DJ too but I didn't go look.  Unfortunately, our server was rude and unattentive. I never received a refill on my water and the chicken sandwich was bone dry. I asked for some sauce for my \"Arizona's Best\" sandwich and was told \"It has it on there\" by my waitress.   Another thing that bothered me was the parking. The majority of their parking lot is reserved for the hotel next door believe it or not. I don't know how much control the restaurant has over that but I found it ridiculous to park across the street and walk to the entrance. The food is normally delicious but I feel I had a bad night, and the service made it worse. I won't be back to this location but I'll go to another one someday. Maybe I'll see Donovan McNabb at the Gilbert location again!",

She then continued with \"If you guys continue dating is it important she gets along with your mother?\" Well my boyfriends mom unfortunately passed away a few years ago. So that was awkward. She then asked if it was important we have the same religion.   Who asks such invasive questions to two people that are just coming to the restaurant to get some food!? We weren't trying to have a controversial debate.  Food was ok nothing special. We got chicken & waffles, and chorizo with eggs. Chicken was real dry and chorizo was bland.

Almost everyone in my party got a chicken and waffle combo. One of us got rib eye and eggs breakfast. She said it was over seasoned. However, I tasted it and found to be perfect for my palette. Her meat was cooked to order which is always a plus. Never have I had such crispier flavorful chicken. You guys are doing great. Thank you for the awesome food and service.",

    "text": "Pro:  The food is very good - so good I'd probably put up with the annoyances again.   Cons:  I'm seeing this in a lot of reviews about this place - the service is kinda slow. After we were seated, no one talked to us for 15 minutes or so. A nice woman (manager? owner?) came over and asked if anyone was helping us. I said no, and a server showed up after another 5 minutes or so. It was busy, but not crazy-busy. The time between when we were seated and when we got food was about an hour.   The interior of the new location is beautiful, but it's really hard to have a conversation because it's loud and everything echoes off the hard brick, concrete and glass surfaces. The old location was nice and basic, a good place to hang out with friends and fam. The new place is a good place to sit and yell at each other, and smile and nod when you can't hear their response. \"This place is great.\" \"WHAT?\" 'I SAID THIS PLACE IS GREAT.\" (smile, nod...) \"yeah\" \"WHAT?\" \"YEAH!\" They need some kind of sound control in there. I'm not saying it should be like a library, but I would like to be able to have a conversation.   Valet parking. Ugh. It is \"complimentary\" but I feel like a cheap jerk if I don't tip the guy for bringing my car from 50 feet away. Wouldn't it just be faster / easier for me to walk the 50 feet and get my own car?  I'm conflicted. I still love the food, but Lolo's has gone from being a simple, friendly place with great food to just another trendy, annoying Scottsdale hangout. That's progress I guess.",

It was close to 12:45pm before we were seated, but we anticipated a wait and were prepared.  We weren't prepared for the terrible experience inside the door.  It was at least fifteen minutes before our order was taken. We lost the first members of our party who couldn't wait for their food forty minutes later. Another member dropped out at the one-hour mark and one more at the hour and fifteen-minute mark. In all honesty, they never ate at Lo-Lo's before and didn't know what they were missing.   During this time, we watched as every table around us was served, so I asked to speak to a manager and found the root of the problem.  When I asked if he was the manager he didn't say hi, he didn't offer his name, he just shrugged his shoulders.  Finally, he graced me with his presence before heading into the kitchen to investigate.  He returned with the following line \"according to your ticket time, sir, you have only been waiting for thirty one minutes.\"  When we questioned if it was possible the waitress forgot to enter the order in right away he repeated the line like a robot and closed with \"that's what I have to go on.\" I was ready to leave when another member of my party took over the conversation and was invited by the manager to go look at the ticket time in the kitchen.      I estimate he wasted about ten to fifteen minutes trying to justify their poor service than actually tackling the problem.    Suddenly, like magic, our food started to arrive. Our waitress removed the charges for the orders of our party members who had to leave, which I applaud her for. The manager, we never saw him again. Not to touch base, not to say sorry, not even to invite us back.  I don't think we will be back...but the food is SO GOOD!",

Bruce to the rescue!  He saw that she was about to mess this up, took the rag from her, got us seated and ensured that the remainder of our experience was fabulous.  The food was great, which is really what brings us back time and time again to LoLo's.  So this visit gets a 5 despite a somewhat questionable start.",

Tonight's experience was a little disappointing with the entire experience.   We went on 6/10/15, and it was not good.   We had gone a few weeks ago, had chicken & waffles, and sides were not edible.  I ordered the beans & rice, and one bite, and it had to go to the side.   Last night was another poor experience.  Started with appetizers, never had them before, so why not.  The fried pickles reminded me of generic frozen fried pickles you can get at grocery store.  Not edible.   The corn fritters were not what was expected, corn/jalapeno, not really a fritter, cause the inside was not 'frittery' if that makes sense - more edible, just not what I expected in a fritter.    Fried green beans were the best - as compared to the other 2.  Dinner, I had catfish, which was GREAT, however, it lacked some 'sauce', cause it's dry, and the only sauces available are their proprietary hot sauce on the table & ketchup.   I miss the vinegar w/ the pepper, that is no longer available.   The sides.  Collards..  My fave, cause you know they were cooked for HOURS - well, this wasn't.  They were still 'stiff' and no spice or ham hoc flavor.  (this was my 2nd experience with them this way, so I think this is there 'newer' style.  Disappointing, cause I liked them so tender and smokey and spice, and yeah, gone.   Mac & cheese was my other side, and it wasn't special - wouldn't order it again either.  I guess if you are ordering chicken & waffles - nothing else, you're good, but caution to other items.  They do not live up to the greatness of their staple dish.",

    "text": "On my trip to Arizona, I had the fortunate opportunity to join in a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event), the Breakfast Club. Monica O. has been the host of this wonderful tradition and I was excited to be a part of it! I heard some awesome things about this place so I knew I had to try it out!  When we got in, I was super modern and nice! Exposed air ducts, dark wood and stainless steal accents made for the modern farm look.The place did a great job on the great job on the decor as well. Oversized pictures of chickens and neon lights to pop out. Our server was super efficient and really catered to our needs. We asked him to give us separate checks in the beginning and he did a fantastic job splitting them by the time our meals were done. Speaking of meals, here's what I got:   -#3 Lo-Lo's for $13. Three piece chicken prepared southern style, with two golden waffles. For the three piece, I got a thigh, drumstick and wing. OH-EM-GEE, I LOVED the chicken! Super crispy skin and juicy on the inside. The chicken was spiced nicely and was packed with flavor. The wafflers were two large patties, stacked and served with butter and syrup. The waffles weren't as fluffy as I was hoping for. I little flat and dense however mixed with butter and syrup, it turned out good.   Overall, this place definitely rocked! I will definitely make my way back to Lo-Lo's on my next Phoenix/Scottsdale trip. If you're in the area, you need to check them out. Try their chicken and you will NOT be disappointed!",

    "text": "Listen, I want to support this business but I cannot in good conscience give Lo-Lo's a good review due to the perpetually awful service received on 5+ visits to this location.  It truly does not seem to matter when you come...the wait for a table has never EVER been less than 40 minutes on any occasion that I've come here. Often, it's been an hour or more. This has been consistent during brunch, lunch, and dinner...on weekends and weekdays.  The only reason I continually subject myself to this is because when my family visits from Ohio, this is the only place they want to eat! And they want it almost every damn day! Argghhh!  Perhaps that is because of the storied fried chicken. As a pescatarian, I wouldn't know. The only meat I eat is fish. My family raves about this chicken though and claim it's worth the wait and poor service we receive in order for them to get it.  I'm skeptical to say the least.  Speaking of fish- I am less than impressed with the fried fish at Lo-Lo's. I've tried it twice and it's virtually flavorless. What I believe is happening is, they season the fish AFTER they fry it instead of before? I don't know, just a theory. I can't otherwise explain why it's so bland.  The fries however? Delicious!! I absolutely love them. I'm also a big fan of their omelettes. The waffles, while yummy, are always soggy and this ruins them for me. I like a nice crisp waffle. Not a flaccid, limp one. But every time I come here, that's what I'm served. Even when I specifically ask for it to be crispy/not soft. Very frustrating.  I also have to comment on the wait staff. Many of my servers have been perfectly nice people but ALL of them have screwed up my or my party's order on EVERY VISIT. They either forget certain things you've specified about your order, bring the wrong sides, or forget multiple times to bring napkins, drink re-fills, etc..   I really question whether Lo-Lo's hires people who are experienced at waiting tables or simply welcomes any old Joe off the street a job serving their customers. To be a good server, one has to have to have a good memory, be fast, and take proper orders. In theory, it seems simple, but in practice it's really not.   I truly hope Lo-Lo's will improve and warrant an updated review from me in the very near future, but I won't hold my breath.",

On this particular visit, none of that mattered.  They have a server named Mike, who worked in the restaurant last Sunday, 3/19/17.   I've been in the hospitality industry a long time and I have never come across a server so pleasant, so professional, and so on his game (even in the middle of chaos and adversity), as this individual. He's as good as it gets.   If I came across this employee in my home town back in California, I would do the unethical thing, and try and steal him for my workplace.   Congratulations to this restaurant for having this employee, which I'm sure is in some part attributed to their workplace culture, recruitment and hiring practices, but this specific employee is a gem.   Cheers to that!",

    "text": "The food here is really good, as always, just like any other location. However, the service that I experienced at this location was horrible.   Planned to celebrate my birthday here with a large party last Sunday. My wife called them a couple of times during the week leading up to the day of our planned visit. From talking to two different people, she was informed that they would be able to accommodate our party with no issues. We planned on having 40 guests and she was told that they've entertained as many as 60 guests before. They know that we are coming with 40. They know we're coming on a Sunday, for lunch. They don't do reservations but \"as long as we get there about an hour early, it'll be fine.\" So far, so good.   Day of, my wife and I get there 45 minutes early (not quite an hour, I know.) We told the hostess our situation and wanted to put our name down for the wait, and they were floored by the amount of people. They began to explain how difficult it would be to accommodate so many people, being that it's their busiest day and at the busiest time. So after waiting for about half and hour, listening to the give us inconsistent information and watching them scramble to make something work for us, we just decide to move the party elsewhere. Before we left, the manager Marcus told us that if we (my wife and I) came back during the week he would \"give us a free meal\". They messed up, but they're trying to make it right. Cool.   Last night, we came back for our \"free\" meal. We told the waitress before ordering what Marcus promised us. We didn't hear from Marcus until our bill arrived. Our waitress initially came out saying we can get 30% off. We said that wasn't what we were promised. So then Marcus came out and said that we misunderstood him. He said he would give me, the birthday celebrant, a free meal. So he gave me the option of either getting my entree for free or 30% off the entire bill. Then when we ran the card it ended up being just about 50% after all. Not that we're not appreciative, but it didn't seem like they were going by any kind of policy and was just winging it. With only $15 to pay, he apologized that he couldn't comp the entire thing but somehow was able to offer a free dessert. That kind of confused us. Why have us go through all of this if you can do that? Why not just cover the meal entirely?   Basically, they messed up. We gave them a second chance and they somehow made the experience worse. Personally, I can't stand it when people don't stick to their word. For that, they get 1 star.",

This particular time when I went to the one in Scottsdale, it wasn't packed at all (Saturday afternoon) and we were seated immediately.   As much as I would like to order something different than Chicken and Waffles, my mind just wouldn't let me. It was pulling on my heart strings, and I did it again! No shame in my order, however; I am sure the waitress was like DAY-UM... you smashed three pieces of chicken and waffles?? The only thing I see left on your plate is a chicken bone graveyard!   I am sure it goes without saying the food was excellent, just like it is every time I have been... A PHX staple, in Lo-Lo's, a place that I feel like I HAVE to come back to every time I go to PHX...

The problem with ordering simple fare in Lo-Lo's is watching everyone else's food roll out. Yes, fried chicken smells delicious. Large, generous portions. The waffles, when smothered in butter and layered in syrup, smell delightful.   Grits - I finally could not control my fork, and sampled my neighbor's - are delicious. So gosh darn good I might return to Lo-Lo's strictly for the grits. But this time I'll be sure to leave room for a #8. A popular item in our large breakfast group.  The staff at Lo-Lo's are remarkable. While our group had yet to fully arrive on time (AHEM, late comers) the hostess served me coffee.   Yes, I was that person. I really needed a cup of Joe. It was my birthday! Coffee to the rescue! (at 8:30 for anyone on time!) Monico O. did a superb job selecting the final location for Breakfast Club. {Applause and thanks!}  Happy Hour Details M-F 3-7pm F-S 9-11pm  Bar seems perfect for catching a game with the television space.

My senior Mom misheard & headed straight out to the patio & she seated herself on the patio on a BUSY Saturday at prime time lunch time. This seating is not a seat yourself it's seated by the host staff. However the sweet young man that was the server in the area saw what happened was an innocent mistake on my Mom's part & spoke with the host & they allowed us not only to be seated ahead of another group waiting but let us stay on the patio. What a joy to see someone in their 20's having compassion for someone 60+ years their senior made my day. I was so moved that we didn't have to embarrass & move her I tipped an additional 20% on top of the usual 20% I usually tip. I will never foregut that trip or that young mans kindness.  The food oh yeah that's what we're here for right? RIGHT! I have been frequenting Lo-Lo's for years & visited them when they had one location downtown. I'm happy this local fam has made the transition to multiple locations because the fried chicken is beyond perf with crisp moist chickeny goodness & perfectly chewy fluffy waffles. I am a super fan of the sweet & salty combo probably because I am that as well. So I can't vouch any other thing on the menu as I have never left what they're known for. I know shame on me but why mess with the best? Just sayin'.  The new Scottsdale location is head & shoulders about the previous in what was a Kyoto Bowl once upon a time & they have a bar & a DJ all day on the weekends. Gotta love that. Well I do so there. Keep it up Lo-Lo's & cheers to many more years of success.",

Lemonade was very good...no coffee service at the bar.  Wait was about 15-20 minutes considering the dining room and parking lot were full. Overall a good experience but can't quite say that I'm a fan.",

The potato salad is SO good as well as the mac & cheese. It's a toss up between the chicken and catfish as both are delicious! Definitely recommend either.",

    "text": "I am sad to say that Lo-Lo's has gone downhill in my opinion. I started with the original location downtown, then I was happy when a location opened in my neighborhood in South Scottsdale. I have been living out of the country since summer 2011, & was excited to see the new bigger location in Old Town.  I decided to go in for a meal today, & the food was still good, but not as good as I remembered. The real disappointment was the service. I wasn't acknowledged when I walked in. I looked around, & decided to eat at the bar. There was an older guy behind the bar. He didn't even say hi, until someone else told him I was there. Then he started to take my order, walked off with no explanation, then came back to say they were out of it earlier, but they had it now. Ok great. I was ready to finish my order, but he walked off & greeted other customers & started telling them about happy hour. I was shocked. I reminded him that I hadn't finished ordering, & so he came back. I can honestly say I have never had an ordering situation like this before in my life. Then he never came back. Someone else ran my food out, & he seemed to be leaving for the day.  I totally get that it must have been the end of his shift, but he could have at least checked on my food & told me he was moving my tab over. He still hung out for a bit to chat with other employees, so it's not like he was rushing out. The lady who took over, was nice & gave decent service.  My bill came to just under $30 for a lemonade, one happy hour cocktail, & a chicken meal. Frankly I could get the same meal elsewhere with better service for less. It's sad to see that Lo-Lo's has become this.",

Food has greatly changed since the move. The backwoods that I ordered which was my favorite in the past now is made with jalapeno's in it and much less sauce and meat.  Chicken no longer seems to use the original recipe and has changed.  The atmosphere is loud and service almost non existent. Lunch required 3 hours due to waiting or a waitress or waiter when none showed up. Then the wrong orders were brought, drinks were never refilled and the meal was a total shambles.  My last review was a 5 star review, but they have gone so far downhill that I can only give them 2 stars at this time.  I'm going back to Mrs. Whites where even though she no longer cooks, the recipes aren't tampered with and service is still done with a smile and in a timely manner.  Perhaps if Lolo's didn't try to franchise so quickly and paid more attention to this restaurant it might have been better.",

But there was a large family group with 3 little ones who were seated at least 30 mins prior to us who had not had their order taken. When the manager came to my table I ask him to please check on that family. They were so frustrated that words were exchanged and they left. Very bad experience!!!! The food was probably good but I could t enjoy it because of the frustration with the poor and unorganized service. SMH!!!!",

Soooo it seemed perfect to meet up for a brunch date here to explore the menu a little further! We agreed on brunch and he picked the spot.   Parking is a little wonky because they share a lot with a hotel, but it appears that they have free valet (like many Valley places) because of the situation. LoLo's does not take reservations, but if you have time they have a fully-stocked bar to pass time.   It was a weekend so the expected wait time was 40 minutes but we only waited 20. Our server was sweet because I had to go over the menu a few times before deciding to get chicken and waffles as my date did. Sheeda's Special was great and a perfect amount of food for what I was hankering. I wish I had seen they have blue kool aid before I picked regular lemonade, because that would be a total throwback to my childhood.   Their drink specials look good for a Sunday Funday and I hope to return for one of those soon!",

We shared a few meals so as to try a variety of items. The macarone and cheese was the favorite. The fried chicken is good yet I guess I was expecting a little more pizzazz.  Overall, was a nice experience yet a little pricey considering the portion size and that we split 2 meals between 4 people.",

The flavor of the southern style chicken made us want to return as well. We had the 3 piece chicken platter and as sides we chose a waffle and rice with gravy. The waffle was big and crispy. I wouldn't get the rice again, but the macaroni tasted great. Made from scratch. To top off the meal, the corn bread that is included with the platter has a big glob of butter on top and the bread is delicious!",

Thank you bacon. I will be going elsewhere for my fried chicken cravings. Service was alright.",

After the beer and appetizer it took 50 minutes to get the rest of the meal. When I asked the bar maid where lunch was at about 48 minutes, she barked, I'm only one person, went to the kitchen and got my food. The chicken was just warm. The grits were thickened up and for cheese grits just had some shredded cheddar on top. The collard greens were good. When I asked if the biscuit came with butter and honey or anything, she said, oh you want some? Never asked if I wanted another beer, and at that point I frankly didn't. Guess I'll keep looking for some Nashville Hot Chicken at some new place that really cares about someone dining with them. And shows it with their attitude.",

I had the blackened fish dinner (choice between catfish & cod) .. i went with the catfish .. served with shrimp in butter sauce, dirty rice and zucchini medley .. I skipped the rice and got a double order of veggies .. this is a great entree if you're on a low carb diet but not if you're on a low fat diet .. it's a lot of food!! It was really delicious!   I'll be back for sure!! Hopefully for a cheat meal so I can have some of those waffles or desserts (red velvet pancakes or cake ... can't go wrong at this spot!!)",

In the first two scenarios the replacement batch solved our problem and we were satisfied enough to eat. However, yesterday's replacement batch was just as dry. So dry that I could have easily choked. It was awful. The server did comp our bill which was great. However, you can't be a chicken and waffle restaurant serving dry flavorless chicken. Such a disappointment. At least for now, I will not be visiting again anytime soon.",

The chicken was crunchy on the outside and oh so moist and juicy in the inside: definition of the perfect fried chicken. Waffles were not too big or sweet:  perfect balance to the saltiness from the chicken.  This was my first time having shrimp and grits. Let me tell you if this is how it's made then it's my new favorite dish. Grits was cooked just right. Shrimp was well seasoned and not over cooked.  The sauce on top had bacon, mushroom and spinach. This was a great meal. I'm already salivating dreaming about it.  I had the pink lady which was a great refreshing cocktail for a hot afternoon. You can't go wrong with grape kool aid either.   Staff was great! Highly recommended!",

Full bar inside as well and drink prices are reasonable and served in big mason jars. The kool aid drank is just like you remember having as a kid on a hot summer day. Sweet and tasty. Tons of options for chicken and waffle combos. Whether you want a breast, leg, thigh, wings or even tenders. And of course, they are all served with a big golden waffle. They also have all the good comfort food sides as well. Portion sizes are hearty and worth the price. Service is a bit slow though even when the restaurant wasn't terribly busy and plenty of staff on hand. Definitely a place to bring out of towners or people who have never heard of such a place that serves chicken and waffle together.",

I usually just park behind the restaurant in the other business parking lots.   Aside from the parking, the food is on point. I've never really cared for the idea of chicken and waffles, but oh boy, this place will have you thinking twice. I usually get the Betty's Breast combination (which is a super tender fried chicken breast along with a waffle), and it never disappoints. Their drinks are also served in huge mason jars, so you don't have to worry about your server having to continuously refill your drink.   This place isn't expensive, but it's definitely not your Waffle House. It usually equates to about $12/person if you're just getting a non-alcoholic drink and a combination. The service is always decent, and I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood.",

This time I tried the biscuits and gravy.  They were a bit strange.  Huge biscuits with not enough gravy.  The gravy tasted like none I had before and not necessarily in a good way.... Lots and lots of fried breakfast potatoes with it but there was nothing special about them either... quite bland.  The over medium eggs were a bit over cooked but the best part of the meal.  My brother tried the fried chicken and thought it was the best he had ever had.  Wants to go again before he leaves town.  He also had grits that I tried with the butter and they were the best grits I had ever had.  My daughter had ordered chicken and waffles.  She opted for all breast meat chicken and that added $4 to the bill.  My sister tried the coleslaw.  It looked like regular run of the mill coleslaw.",

The greens shall have no stems!! The macaroni isn't anything special, I come from a Black/Rican Family so we aren't allowed To really positively comment on others Mac n Cheese, but it's delicious and it's creamy and it's cheesy! Shhhhh don't tell my family I said that. Haha.. now on to the main attraction the chicken and the waffles! The waffles and chicken are better than Roscoes, Amy Ruth's and Gladys Knights combined. Yes I've had all three! The waffles for one are huge and full Of flavor.. vanilla and cinnamon? Check. Sorry Roscoes, your waffles kinda suck... Oh yeah anyway, The chicken is huge, juicy and crispy. Not over cooked like cough cough Amy Ruth's . Okay I'll stop throwing jabs.   Eat here! The prices aren't horrible. The koolaid will give you that sugar rush you've craved and the food is made with lots of love.  There is a lot of seating, a lot of parking, and the environment is very diverse. Bring the family.",

It appears Lolo's participates in the same transaction fraud that a well know pizza chain does. Apparently it doesn't matter if you pay a tip in cash and cross out or put 0.00 on your signed receipt because the person closing will add whatever tip they want at the end of the night and think you're too stupid to check your account. We called the manager to complain and was told we had to drive back to Scottsdale 30 miles from our home to present our receipt before the bogus tip was removed. So much for customer care. We had to go through the bank to dispute the transaction. Don't trust the establishment unless you're paying in cash!",

I do not know what people are complaining about, the service is always great. I believe in treating others with respect and kindness in order to get served the way you want, so maybe that's why I've never had a bad experience. The owner was in the front of the house tonight, so I felt like I met a celebrity when I told him I love his restaurant. I think it's good that he sees the FOH operations and can manage his staff that way. I think they should open a Tucson location.

I absolutely hate Yelp reviews, but my recent experience at the Scottsdale location of Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles was Yelp worthy. I didn't wait very long to be seated whatsoever, but I waited over 40 minutes for my food when the place wasn't completely overwhelmed with people. Not to mention, while waiting my server did not even bother to touch base with us and when the food finally came out, all he had to say was \"your starvation is over\". Usually when food takes forever, a manager will come to your table and acknowledge there was an issue but the manager just walked past us. As a server, I know that this is a situation where a manager should have at least stopped by to give us an explanation as to what was going on. At the conclusion of my visit, when getting change, our server did not give us the full amount. Yes it was only 30 cents, but the fact that he did not even bother to ask if we wanted it was truly bullshit. I've had poor service at this location before but it has always been resolved by a manager. In conclusion, if you're going to go to Lo-Lo's, go to the Phoenix location where there is always great service.",

During this last visit I came alone, needing some soul food after receiving some not-so-good news. During my other visits their were at least 2 of us, sometimes 4, so the poor service has nothing to do with the size of the table. Needless to say my server Abigail, was too good to come by more than 3 times to entire time I was sitting, waiting for my food. She was way too busy bossing the other employees around to notice that I hadn't gotten my food in over 25 minutes so I asked another employee of they could check for me. When they brought it out, it was obvious that it had been finished for a while and was just sitting back waiting for my server to drop it. Mind you, I'm sitting solo directly beside the kitchen door (which gave me a straight line of view inside, which I wouldn't recommend watching them cook). I was unimpressed by my chewy, mildly warm waffle, & watered down syrup. The chicken was so inconsistently battered and seasoned that there were some bites that lacked all flavor, and some bites it was wet clumps of seasoning mixed in the batter. The bad service & poor quality food makes me doubt I'll ever come back, even if I am less than 2 blocks away. I'm from the Midwest and lived in Louisville Kentucky for several years, which is the fried chicken capital of the world & this place is just an overly gentrified marketing scheme & lacks real SOUL. And no, I'm not talking about disgusting KFC! Research Indi's fast food, and that will show you REAL, spicy, soulful fried chicken. The koolaid is nice and sweet tho, & better be for $3. My total for one waffle, three chicken strips and a grape koolaid was $17.50 plus tax. Pretty sure I was overcharges somewhere, but Abigail couldn't even bring me my change back. Again, I'm sitting right by the POS & kitchen, so I know she was just avoiding me to keep the tip. Which would have yielded her more if she would have brought it back instead of assuming. Ask yourself Lo Lo's, where's the love & soul? It's def not in your food or customer service! Do you even know what keel is? Are your greens simmered slow from fresh or canned? And there's only one type of hot sauce? Lo-lo's brand of course. Which was watered/vinegar'd down & barely had any spice. What a shame. Personally, this place reminds me of a rip off of roscoes in LA. Except roscoes is worth the 5 hour trip from scottsdale. This place isn't even worth the stroll down the block for me.",

Added LoLos homemade gravy. A must. Super flavor added to Great Waffles. We also had LoLos Southern Fried Chicken. I should have taken picture when We started because nothing left when done.  We Will Be Back!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I feel like they rely too much on their reputation... don't get me wrong, the food is AMZAING but the serivce is not so great.  Long waits I can handle - the place is practically a legend in the valley, but every time I go people in my party are left without things they ordered, drinks run out, things come out in the wrong order etc.    On this last visit I ordered a few corn breads and told the server I wanted them to come out as an appetizer.  They came out with the main course and I just got a casual mention - \"sorry they took so long to come out\".  That kind of defeated the purpose of ordering them since now everyone was interested in their actual food.  We also noticed that the table seated near us - with about the same number in their party - were seated well after us and served before us.  And we didn't take very long to order it was just really slow and disorganized!  I was also a little sad because they didn't even bring syrup automatically, so of course I asked for it when they brought out our food.  Saw the server make a few more runs to other tables while my food got cold waiting for syrup...  Another member in the group realized his chicken and waffles from the KK never arrived... so we flagged down an employee who got our server.  They brought them out eventually but just so much that could have been better!  And not even an apology!  We only had a party of 7 so it's not like we took over the restaurant.  I think maybe the key here is to go, but not order any of the extras because it seems like that's where a lot of the problems come from.",

My wife ordered a chicken sandwich without bacon. They took the sandwich back to the kitchen and tried to fool us by simply taking the bacon off and giving the sandwich back to my wife. So disrespectful and careless. Terrible business practice. I called them out on their dishonesty and they finally made a new sandwich but my wife and children had to wait an additional 20 minutes to be served correctly and they still charged us full price for everything. Needless to say we will never return. Bad business practices. Unprofessional.",

Lolo's recently relocated slightly north on Scottsdale, to a much larger and nicer space. Now an independent building, the new Lolo's features a hip indoor/outdoor bar. Although the old location served alcohol, now it feels like an attractive destination for a drink. I plan on coming here just for drinks in the future.   I ate dinner at Lolo's shortly after the move and am very pleased with the experience. Everything we ordered was amazing as expected.  The portions were huge! Our waitress was sweet and prompt with our food and drinks.   Tip: order the chicken and waffles. If you're feeling especially malnourished, add a side of mac and cheese. No matter what you order, I promise you won't leave hungry! But most importantly, don't forget the koolaid!!!!",

I know stuff happens and I was told that the waffle was gonna be taken off my crack but my brother and I split the cost for the whole family and my food ended up on his as well as his food ended up on my check, CONFUSED?!?

It is everything you need your chicken to be: tender, moist and juicy with a flavorful, crispy crust. Om nom nom.  The other thing I love about Lo-Los is the Kool Aid. They serve it to you in a big 'ol mason jar, and it makes you feel like a kid again. If you want, you can even get a cocktail that's made with Kool Aid. So fun.  Service is good. Food is incredi-balls. The new Scottsdale location has gorgeous decor (major upgrade from the old one!)  Long live Lo-Los and your juicy wonder chicken!",

Our waitress was nice and on top of everything but the kitchen was off today. We got there around 11am and had a short 20 minute wait. We got seated and ordered our drinks and food then we waited... and waited... and waited. Our food finally came around 12:30pm and it wasn't nearly as busy as it normally is when we go. We talked to the manager and he apologized for the extra long wait during a slow time and offered us a couple free desserts. On the way out we heard some banging and screaming in the kitchen area so maybe there was a real issue going on today. This is still my favorite location and I will be back but it probably won't be for a while.",

The chicken was flavorful and juicy. The waffles (and I'm not a huge waffle fan) were melt in your mouth good. I had the #10 (2 legs and waffle), kiddos split a breakfast plate (cheesy eggs and a waffle). Husband had the stupid fries. Upon reading the description for the stupid fries I said \"that sounds disgusting\" well, I was wrong. Took it back a few years and had some kool-aid (which was SUPER sugary - I never noticed that as a kid!).   When we entered the place was packed (it was a week day night) and we had a 5 min wait). Our server, Bre, seemed stretched thin but she did a good job of keeping up. It is pretty loud in here, which worked well for our kids. We did see one family get up and leave because they had not been helped in a timely fashion. Just be prepared for it to be busy and to be a bit patient. It is worth it!  Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Came her Super Bowl weekend for late breakfast. Given 30 minute estimate for a table for party of three which ended up being slightly faster. The rub is that we could see multiple stations with empty tables for the entire time we waited to be seated. My friend insisted that this was the business model to make people wait for a table to create a sense of demand. All if did was create a sense of starvation and impatience.   We ordered a spicy Bloody Mary from bar which was severely under staffed and took almost as long as the table. The drink was awesome but the manager needed to step behind the bar and relieve the back log of orders created by a large superbowl crowd drinking early.   I ordered chorizo and eggs. Brad ordered their signature chicken and waffles and Melissa got the biscuits and gravy. Brad loves this place. It's my first time. The menu looks great and judging by the crowd the food matches the pictures.   Chorizo was a big winner 5 out of 5!  Waffles and chicken was ok and if your hungry is very filling. Waffles are the thin variety. The recipe, like the chicken batter, was nothing spectacular. Biscuits and Gravy gets a perfect rating. Fluffy biscuits and yummy gravy. My recommendation is more gravy. Smoother the plate because we ran out of gravy way before the biscuits. Has to be balanced so they climax at the same time   We had lots left over and check would have been reasonable to high if not for bar tab. I will come back but under performing chicken and waffles plus long wait and staffing shortage behind the bar brings the rating down to solid 3.",

The place was not full but it took over thirty minutes for my order to show up, I see why this place wasn't full I don't know what more to say if they want to stay in business start by changing management and get some servers who want to work then a good cook might be a suggestion. By by lo Lo's you won't be waiting my time ever again.",

I literally drove around 15min to find a fricken parking stop! There are \"no parking\" signs everywhere due to the hotel that's right next door which makes it so inconvenient. I did see there was valet but really? Why does this place have valet? It makes it so much more frustrating to move around the long lines of cars that are waiting for valet. Maybe if the valet guys weren't standing around chatting there wouldn't be so many cars piling up! Anyways parked at the Bank of America across the street since they were closed today, otherwise who knows where I would've  parked.",

On this day I ordered the 3-piece chicken with waffles, with an extra chicken breast and a side of mac and cheese.  I was crazy hungry and usually in that case, almost anything tastes amazing.  Never did I expect to be so disappointed.  The chicken was tasteless, almost like zero seasoning was used, not even a pinch of salt. The breast was very dry. The waffles were an interesting mix of fluffy/dense or dense/fluffy.  They were very heavy to eat, if that makes any sense.  The mac and cheese tasted very artificial and way too mushy.  Normally, I'd devour almost any mac and cheese put in front of me, without complaint, but I got through about 5 bites of Lo-Lo's and had to stop.  I've never tasted \"cheese\" that tasted like that.  Very odd.  I am so disappointed in my experience and wanted so badly for this to be a 5-star experience.  I'm willing to give it a second chance, but not sure when that will be.",

Our drinks was two lemonades and two kool aids for the kids. It took awhile to get our drinks. Our waitress didn't approach us that they ran out of lemonade it was a different waitress. So, we end up getting a pepsi. They brought our drinks and it took awhile for drinks. We were waiting and waiting for our food to come out and it took forever to get our food. We were just tired of waiting that we were about to leave. Right when we decided to leave the food came out. After that we ask for refills he took awhile to get our refills also. After that we ask for the check he took forever to get that too. Than he came out with our refills and the check. I complain to the manager and he said oh i'm sorry he is new. I understand he is new but everytime i was trying to get his attention he was just standing around doing nothing while we were waiting for our refills and check. How new is that???",

First I want to say we went on a weekday around 10 am, no wait at all, we were greeted and sat immediately and not by the hostess (she was seating someone else), the waiter stepped up and sat us. Our server Danielle was awesome, attentive and friendly, we talked about SB weekend and the madness! we will always request her.   As for the food, it was all good. But that's it. The chicken is bland, it looks like they season the flour and not the chicken, big mistake. The waffles also good nothing to write home about, they were thin but good. We also added grits and eggs also good.   We will return, my kids loved it, they say it gets 5 stars clearly I disagree. I would give 3.5 if I could.   See you next time.",

The valet parking captures the whole experience without your ever having to set foot in the door. Valet parking at a soul food restaurant? It's a contradiction.  Basically, they Scottsdalified what used to be a welcoming, soulful restaurant with good food and friendly, spunky service. It used to take me minutes to get my food even when the place was packed; now it took forever with a half-empty restaurant. The staff? No charm whatsoever. It's just the same cold, stale trendy restaurant you expect anywhere else in Scottsdale.  And the food isn't even as good anymore.  Thanks for ruining a good thing, Lo Lo's.",

I'm currently in here on a Tuesday evening. We initially ordered the honey hot wings, which are amazing by the way!!!! AGAIN, my issue is neverrrr with the food. The waitress had a stank attitude, probably because she wanted to go home, but if she was attentive we would have been gone 45 min ago! We've been here for an hour and a half, it's 10:30pm..they close at 10pm..smh!!!   Before we left we ordered the peach cobbler and the banana pudding, both amazing as usual!   Please someone get a grip on the service here though, please I beg of you. The foods amazing, don't change a thing (WITH THE FOOD..lol)",

Yes, 20 minutes just to order our drinks and we threw our food order in as well as we had known for a while what we wanted. During this time I couldn't help notice that every table on either side of us had a different server which seemed to indicate they didn't have an area just specific table assigned at random with nobody really sure who was covering what. Everbody around us (estimate 5 other tables) were equally complaining about the service and another table had to chase down someone to find there server after sitting for about 15 minutes as well. You had to even chase them down to pay your bill. This place didn't seem to understand customer service, througput of getting people in and out to churn more sales and there was no resemblance of management anywhere. Pretty much a free for all. I've had better service in Europe and that's not saying much. 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time we sat down until we were walking out.   After sticking it out on the service side to see what the hype was all about I convinced myself I would separate my thoughts between the service and the product. I ordered the LoLo's Chicken and Waffles after all that's what is listed on the sign outside. It did fill me up, but not wanting more. The waffles were extremely dry and tasted like they just came out of the box. No flavor or life to them at all. The chicken was warm and edible but very dry and without any seasoning. Both items had about as much flavor and life to them as you might find served at a senior care home.  To sum it up the service and quality missed the mark big time, won't be back.",

    "text": "My wife & I tried the new lo-lo's this past Saturday 12/06/14.  It had a very good atmosphere, very open & good seating. Since we had never been there before we decided to go with 2 completely different meals. She went with the chicken & waffles I chose Burger & fries. Server was very friendly & knowledgeable. When food arrived, burger was good & chicken was ok, not something I would wake up on the weekend & make a point to go out of my way or change my plans to get to. A little pricey for the meal but trying it for the first time ok. This is where it gets interesting. If you go Do Not, I repeat Do Not park on your own.  They share the parking lot with the Holiday Inn next door & neither business is sure who owns what as far as the parking arangment goes. You will be towed ($125) & on your own to get your car back. The food is good but the parking arrangment leaves a lot to be desired. They offer valet, but no one will stop you and tell you the difference until it is way to late. Needless to say we will not being going back.",

When I visit here once a month, I go all out, so I can't do it to often because I would never go here just to order a salad - although that's delicious too!  Fantastic food and even better establishment!",

The hosts were rude about getting us sat and ended up seating multiple parties that walked in after. Then once situated at our table, they opened the outside door facing directly at our table, which made it extremely hot. We asked nicely if they could close it, but they responded saying no they weren't allowed. We decided to call over the manager and he said that there was guests sitting outside that they needed it open for, completely disregarding us as guests as well. The bartender heard what was happening and had the nerve to say that we could get up and they would sit other people there, instead of trying to accommodate us and getting us a new table. The remainder of the time we felt unwelcome and disrespected. Overall, the food was great as always and our server tried his best, but the rest of the staff was completely unprofessional and rude! I will never be returning to this location due to the experience I just encountered.",

    "text": "Went on Saturday 12/20/14 for lunch and the 3 of us were seated immediately which was nice, however, we ordered and waited an hour for our food while others around us who were seated after us were being served. Just as we were trying to track down an employee to call a manager to our table after waiting an hour for our food, the server walking towards us had 2 of our 3 plates. We asked him to have the manager come to our table and his response was \"but I have your food here, do you not want it?\". One of my friends stated \"Surely, we will take the food but can you please still have a manager come see us?\". We had no silverware to begin eating and waiting for the 3rd plate. We had to track down another waitress and ask for a manager again as some time had passed and there was still no manager in site, nor the 3rd plate of food. The 3rd plate of food finally came out and we asked for silverware and began eating. Throughout the meal, still no manager. The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \"backed up and having issues\" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to comp us ($11.00) and apologized for the service.   As we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional.",

So let's get to the nitty-gritty!  The service: Excellent. Thursday morning at 10 a.m. and we were seated straight off in a nice comfy booth. The waiter was friendly and efficient and had great timing.  The food: DELICIOUS. I had the fried drumstick and thigh with waffle. The Amadi I believe. The chicken was hot, fried to crispy perfection and sprinkled with just a bit of salt. I tried the syrup on a bit of chicken and it was pretty damn good. The waffle was also very tasty. Thinner than I'm used to, but it totally works. Slight cinnamon taste to the batter, served with lots of butter and that tasty syrup. Normally I can't finish restaurant portions, but this plate was licked clean!  My buddy had the stuffed french toast and barely paused between bites. He said the presentation was unique (think rolled baguette, stuffed, fried, sliced and stood on end), and the taste was excellent. Not overly sugary, but sweet enough. I tend to think most places overdo the brown sugar and cinnamon in french toast, then compound it by drowning it in powdered sugar, syrup or caramel. Not the case here. The filling was like a vanilla cream cheese, just slightly sweeter, with fresh berry topping.  My son got kid's mac n cheese with bacon. In a rare moment of compliance he ate a spoonful without argument and then...WAS QUIET AND ATE HIS FOOD! Seriously, angels were singing. He couldn't finish the whole bowl, but at least he wasn't howling for \"Mickey Donald's\" within 5 minutes of leaving.  The 5th star is reserved for something mind-blowing, while this place is definitely great and a sure treat in the Phoenix area, I can't say it garners 5 stars. Enjoy this place!",

The waffles are not bad but not impressive. $8 for a couple of wings and a tasty flour frisbee, not bad overall.   Service was efficient and friendly. The hostesses were not the friendliest or welcoming I have ever experienced, but hey they got us  to a table.   If management reads these reviews, just mentioning that the hostess staff is the first interaction your customers have with your business.   That brings my only criticism, what does one have to do to get a second cup of coffee or a water refill when your server is tasked with a large group and busy?  Having host staff  pouring water or coffee on the floor when there are two on-duty vs. allowing them to herd and sing to the PA music at the front desk might present additional up-sell opportunities for your business.   We were going to order another breast but we could not get more coffee or water much less food. But a second cup of coffee and a water refill would have been welcome.  To clarify, the place was not slammed busy, only our server was busy.  Anyway, overall good place, actively recommend.",

I think all of the rave reviews I'd heard from so many people ramped up my expectations. In truth, Lo-Lo's is a good family restaurant that has built up a loyal fan base that freely recommends its fare. That's not a bad thing at all.  I had a good, down-home meal and finally got to find out what grits are--nice. My eggs-over-easy with cheese and onions were tasty. The fried chicken crust was crunchy and tasted great, but the pieces were a bit on the small side. The waffles could have been more crisp.  The minor issues cited above might have dropped my rating to 4.51, but that still would round to a \"5.\" What dropped them below 4.50 was the slowness of bringing and refilling our water and the long wait for the food. I think we visited at the tail-end of their busy, post-church Sunday afternoon, but they should have been ready for that.  Overall, it's a good time and I'll visit again at some point.",

The parking and service is NOT family friendly and we will not be back.",

Carl, the waiter, took excellent care of us. He was helpful, polite, and patient. His choices of food were outstanding!! With so many opportunities to choose from off the menu, we couldn't decide so we ordered a little of everything. Everything was finger licking good! Especially the collard greens, chicken, and home fries. The half and half (tea and lemonade) 2 thumbs up!!  We came a second time for lunch on Saturday and Aaron had the pleasure of waiting on us. Service was good, no long waits, food came out at a reasonable time, and Aaron was attentive and took care of all of our needs.  We need a LoLo's in NJ:(",

The owners wife who was apparently playing manager that night was extremely rude. Zero customer service skills. I guess when your husband owns the place you know you won't be fired so you can just be a complete bitch to paying customers. FOR NO REASON.  Insane. It's too bad because this place  is in walking distance of our house and we liked going there, eating good food, having some koolaid cocktails.  If it had just been a normal manager or server that treated us that way, I would have returned. But because it was the owner, it shows the kind of place it really is.",

    "text": "This place was surprising. The food was ok at best. The chicken breast I received was well, well done. I usually eat the skin, but this was bitter and dry and crumbling. The darkest brown in the crayola box. I do not waste food, so even though the meat was dry, i still ate all the edible parts of the breast. The table next to us got a beautiful piece that was golden brown. When asked by the server how we were doing, i said sad. I explained how my chicken was, and showed her the plate of almost black chicken skin and pieces. She went to the back. The owners wife came to the table and with attitude asked  what my problem with the chicken was. I showed her, then pointed to the example of properly cooked chicken at the next table. She then said, well that is a thigh. It wasn't, but the cook is what we were discussing, over cooked is overcooked no matter if it is a breast, drum, or thighs. Then she commented on the fact that i consumed some of it and that it looked tastey to her. I never asked for another piece, was just giving honest feedback. I said \"Its fine, not a big deal\". I did not want to argue with someone about what properly cooked chicken looks like. Then she replied, \"Its not a big deal, why are you making it a big deal?\" Then she decided i was done with the rest of my plate and stomped away. The server brought a piece in a togo bag. Message received, PLEASE LEAVE!!! We declined the piece and promtly left. I have never had someone act this way at a restaurant and was shocked. We had learned that this is not the normal management, but the owners wife. Well its clear she did not have any hospitality training. Well, you have lost a customer for life over an apology, i was full and didn't even want another piece of chicken. I just wanted to let them know there was room for improvement. But a sorry about that, was clearly to much to ask for.",

They hadn't even started it!  They blamed it on their \"lunch rush\" but the service was absolutely appalling.  Another couple had been waiting a long time for their order as well and were really frustrated when we walked in.  We finally had to flag down a manager who had only been working there 3 days and she didn't know what to do.  She ended up giving us a discount but it really didn't make up for the fact that our order was an entire hour later than promised.  All of the employees looked flustered and scattered.  They need to work out their systems.  I know this is a new location but I would imagine they would have moved the staff when they moved the restaurant as it's only 2 blocks away from its previous location.  There was no direction at all.  The food overall was decent but I would not go back due to the appalling lack of service.",

The waffles that came with the chicken were good; the fried chicken I had was tasty but on the dry side. The green beans I had on the side were mushy and tasteless. There are items on the menu I'd like to try in the future, although I'm not sure if the pricey fare would be worth the trip. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 because the interior really looks nice.",

The other night friends I was with really wanted to go here, so I decided to give it a second chance. I wish we ate at McDonald's instead. On a Saturday night I expect them to be busy but still able to function. For our 6 top we waited about 10 mins to be seated. No biggie. Our server was very nice but had an awesome habit of disappearing for long periods at a time. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or she just disappeared. I asked for a tea-which she forgot about. Someone from our group had to find her to ask for my drink after nothing for 20 or so mins. My food was awful. Eggs swimming in liquid and almost ice cold potatoes (Side note if you are going to charge $4 extra for them please make sure they are hot). What was the worst of this was our table waited around 45 minutes or more for our food. When my friend asked her for my missing drink we were informed it would be another 20 mins for food. There's no excuse for this. A restaurant should be able to push out food and not make people wait an hour for food. We would have left had we of not already been waiting and starving. Absolute waste of money. We got there around 7:30 and didn't leave till after 9PM. For a place that has a lot of recognition this should have been a way better experience.",

We all started with waters and shortly after ordered food and drinks. The bartender never brought my Melon mojito but that wasn't the problem.   When our appetizers came out we asked the barback if we could have utensils/napkins for our catfish beignets. The fratboy six roommate in a one bedroom girlfriend sharing barback asks the bartender if for napkins and the bartender shrugs his shoulders and says \"Nope, all out,\" and proceeds his convo with a woman sitting at the bar which he was clearly flirting with. The barback walks off to grab the silverware and when he walks back he snidely says, \"You guys need silverware for your beignets?!\" Why would you fix your face to say something like that to a customer?! Apparently he doesn't give a damn about making money and keeping customers.  He tried to redeem himself by having conversation with my friends but its too late for that. My mind was made up an hr ago. On another note I will say that the food was good and thats the ONLY reason they even got those two measely stars.",

    "text": "My son and I had mixed reviews.  The chicken was a bit salty for my taste, hardly any crunch to the coating, nothing special to rave about.  The mac&cheese tastes just like Cracker Barrel, which I love. Potato Salad was AMAZING! Cornbread was blah, I make better. Sweet tea tasted like McDs - bag of sugar - Yuck!  My son had the blue Kool-Aid, that was really good. He said Waffle House, the ole greasy spoon, has better tasting waffles. I'm not a waffle fan, but had a bite - NOPE!  Parking is Valet because of the hotel right next to it or find your own. Good amount of food for the price. Service was just ok.  I would go back again and try more sides, but next time go to the Phx location, which was closed do to maintenance issues inside.",

The menu is conveniently labeled with popular combinations of their chicken and waffle platters. Not only that but they also have pancake options such as red velvet which are absolutely amazing.   To make things an even sweeter deal this location boasts a full bar and is located close to the heart of old town so you can keep the party going or crash out in a chicken coma at the Hyatt next door.",

But I do know Chicken and I am not unfamiliar with Soul food. And to me, and our group of four, this is GOOD food. The chicken is crispy but juicy and properly done on the inside without being greasy. They obviously start with good meaty chicken. The corn muffins are great and the sweet potatoes were unbelievable. The fried okra was good but nothing special.   No waffles this trip, but I do recall that last time I had them they were pretty good. I passed on waffles this time since it is not too hard to find (or make at home) good waffles. But great chicken is a something worth crossing the road for. The outside covered patio was nice on a spring day.",

We eagerly awaited the opening of the Gilbert location and finally made it down. What an utter disappointment. The wait staff was so rude and seemed to hate being there. Our server was polite, but not completely competent. Even Maurice didn't seem comfortable and relaxed here. As a person of color with an advanced degree, I enjoy eating in a variety of restaurants. However, minority owned and operated restaurants have my heart. Good food aside, that's why I love Lolo's; it reminds me of the soul food places I ate at back home in L.A. The Gilbert location is very gentrified and so Gilbert-washed with its customers dressed like slobs (just like they do elsewhere in town) griping about the Gospel music, and its weird chicken art, there is nothing distinguishing Lolo's from any other restaurant on the block. I won't be back. I live near Florence and it's about 90 minutes each way to drive to their location on Central. That's where I will go to enjoy my chicken and waffles with customers who dress (YEAH we DRESS the f--- up!!!) to eat out and chill while watching Soul Train or listening to their sick DJ on Saturday night.  As my poor white boy husband who grew up on Chicago's south side remarked, \"It's like they white washed it, if that makes sense.\"",

Forced use of valet parking was the first bad sign. You either valet or, like us, park across the street and walk. All other spaces are reserved for hotel guests. The restaurant was busy and very loud. We were seated and placed our order for both drinks (including water--it was a hot afternoon) and food fairly quickly, but had to wait a good 15 minutes before we got the drinks. When we did we got three of our drinks in the large mason jars and one in a small one with no waters...they apparently ran out of clean glasses. After another 20 plus minutes we finally get the water and another 20 before we got our food. No check ins from our waitress no refills. It wasn't just us--the table next to us was waiting for a takeout order and there was some issue addressed with the manager. I was going to mention our poor service to him but he disappeared. We love LoLos but will try the Gilbert location or go downtown before going back to Scottsdale,",

However, I wish they used the same coating for the chicken and gizzards. The gizzards seriously lacked seasoning. My chicken was outstanding and was terrific! Very moist and hot, not over cooked or dried out. They know how to fry chicken here. My waffle was very good, I like that they serve a thin or Scandinavian style waffle.

My go to at Lo Lo's has always been the soul food platter with catfish, chicken breast, greens and Mac and cheese, tons of food and I usually take quite a bit home.  Sometimes I opt for a veggie plate which is generally a ton of food.  That is until today when I ordered a veggie plate to go.  Four sides and a cornbread $16 out the door.  I've never complained because of the quality as well as quantity.  Today when I picked up my order I thought to myself DAMN that bag seems awful light.  Well it was four 1/2 pint containers about half full...Seriously LoLo's WTF???  And the strings beans and red potatoes side were green beans straight out a can a maybe two pieces of potatoes.  Mac and Cheese has become hit and miss.  Not happy today guys.  You can't get too big, and start screwing things up...I'm sure I'll be back but probably for dine in only.

Then put on the syrup with the chicken on in.  Don't forget the gravy and a little ketchup if you will.  Maybe get it with an egg, and get the yokes to on through it.  Or you can cut the chicken up so you can make yourself a taco out of this scrumptious combination.  I also had a delicious Bloody Mary to go with the chicken and waffles so that I could get vegetables into this meal.  There are other ways to get vegetables if that's your thing too.  You can get something with something something on the side IDK CHECK THE MENU.  I'M STICKING WITH THE CHICKEN N WAFFLES.  This is a great place to go on a cheat day with your diet, just to get the sugar salts cravings reconciled.  The service is fantastic.  They commit to excellence with the scorecard they give you and that's a nice touch.   It's a shame this fine",

They were terribly understaffed.  Our waiter was working tables all over the restaurant.  It really wasn't' this fault for the terrible service. He was doing his best.  Mgt should have had a lot more help, and of course we never saw mgt., anywhere.  Took for ever to get anything.....drinks, appetizers , which we later canceled, and  out main entrees.   When they brought out entrees, they messed up.  Got dinners that weren't ours.  I think we got someone else's entrees, and had to get new entrees for those that were wrong. Two people in our group ordered appetizers for their dinner...gizzards, fried much rooms, and and zucchini.  The gizzards were not chewy, but mushy!  And the mushroom and zucchini coatings were two different colors.  I got the feeling that those two items were not coated and fried on premise.  I think they got them at Costco Business Center.  They too were soggy, not crispy. Then the waffles....they were SO thin!  They couldn't have gotten them at Costco.  Even Costco's frozen wafflesg are thicker then these.   Needless to say.....we won't be back.  One star is for the waiter who was doing his best.",

    "text": "I've heard so many good things about this place, but the recent yelp review made me second guess about it.   Firstly, PARKING IS HORRIBLE. They have \"complementary valet\" parking because there is not self parking nearby. You are suppose to park around the other side of the street or hotel (honestly I'm still not too sure, we just parked on the far side of the hotel) if you want to self park and save yourself the couple bucks. I've been to restaurants where theres pretty much valet only, but the Valet boys were so unclear as to where we were able to park if we wanted to self park without getting towed.  Inside was busy on Saturday bunch. We ended to sitting at a table in the bar area which is honestly just as good at sitting at a regular table. Our server was fast, kinda, cheerful, and very helpful. Minor mess up, but nothing I would get upset over.   We ordered: - Red Velvet Pancakes: huge red stacks drizzed with creamcheese frosting. SO filling.  - Lil C: ordered 1 thigh and 1 wing (but got 2 thighs) with mac and cheese. The fried chicken was good, but i wish it had a little more taste to it. The mac and cheese on the other hand was BOMB. So cheesy and rich. Its thick, so it can get a little dry - Waffle: thin, soggy waffle :( I wish it was crispy but it had a nice taste -Lemonade: YUM! supposedly its homemade and i recommend it! -Koolaid: YES, KOOLAID. Throw back to your childhood and sip on your favorite flavor/color in a huge mason jar.   Price is a little bit on the pricier side since its just chicken and waffles/brunch, but the amount that they give you can justify it. We went home full and with to-go boxes   Environment: 3/5  ( because of parking) Food: 3/5 Price: 3.5/5 Service: 5/5",

We ordered chicken & waffles, grits, mac n cheese. I didn't really like the mac n cheese. It could've been better. However, everything else taste great. I love the taste of cinnamon on the waffles. The grits were fluffy and buttery, the chicken was crispy and flavorful. Chicken reminded me of my grandma's chicken.  The second visit I ordered the catfish and waffle. I believe I like the chicken and waffle combo better, but the catfish was also good. I think I was expecting more than one piece of catfish, or maybe a larger piece of catfish.   My friend ordered a side salad and chicken wings and said they were very good. My other friend ordered the same thing each time. Ordering the chicken breast and waffle with a side of peanut butter. He loved it!   The bartender/ waitress was very attentive, both times we visited this restaurant over the course of the weekend. The drinks were reasonably priced and had the right amount of liquor. Her recommendations on drinks were spot on and so were the mimosas.   I would recommend coming here with your family, friends, coworkers, etc.",

    "text": "The buzz has been heard for the past 6 years I've resided in Phoenix- Lolo's chicken and waffles is a must try! So I finally did today. I've came by the restaurant in the past, only to find long lines or lack of parking so it's steered me away to come back another time. Today, I got the chance to sit and dine with no wait as I was running late meeting with some pals. It is 3 PM on a Sunday afternoon, so it was busy and every seat taken. We order the bottomless mimosas and are served by our friendly waitress. When it's time to order, I go for the number 3 \"Lolo's\" which was three chicken pieces and 2 waffles. If I were to come back I'll go with a smaller portion as I didn't realize these chicken pieces (leg, wing, and breast) were not small! The waffles too were pretty big! Glad to finally try Lolo's out, it isn't the best fried chicken, and I'm comparing the chicken and waffles to that one other I went to in Brooklyn, NY (Sweet Chic, A++++!)... the friendly vibe and portion size make up for it. This restaurant's cleanliness was well kept but I speak for this location.  You should give it a shot, too!",

We wanted to sample the signature dish and another entree so we split her Tre-Tre and my chorizo and eggs (which was the way to go for us).  As with most restaurants these days drinks have gone from being \"cheap eats\" to \"muy expensive\".  This spot is no different as a healthy glass of OJ and an endless cup of coffee were almost 1/3 of the total bill.   Next time will do the Kool-Aid \"on tap!\" so at least I will be happy spending the money.  After digging on the music and noticing the full bar & drink menu we wished we had stopped in the night before.  We also noticed the menu listed a location in the DFW Area (hey peeps...need to advertise!!!) and the Phoenix Airport so we made plans to hit it again that afternoon before we flew out (bad decision as the airport location is NOT the same).",

This spot is huge fun, hip and trendy so, we definitely met our goal. I love the 90's R&B playing in the background and could feel the vibes they're try to elicit here. It really got me in the mood to enjoy some juicy succulent delicious crispy fried chicken!  The locale is decked out with plasmas on the wall and a large bar in the center with a view to the open patio. We all ate our fill of waffles and chicken that we had enough to take home for seconds. This time around I was able to have a bite of a cheesy shrimp and grits dish because one of my daughters felt like living on the wild side and trying something different. I took home to the hubs and he loved it! The only downside to this particular location is the parking. You either have to park back by the hotel or valet it. I opted to valet as it was warm out and I was not enthusiastic about a leisurely stroll. Also, we had a waitress that was not very attentive and it seemed like there was a lack of communication among staff. Other than that if I was in the vicinity and had a hankering for some home style soul food I'd be back!",

It took a really long time for us to get our drinks and orders placed. At least 20-30 minutes from sitting down. But, the waitstaff was friendly. I got the double breast meal with one waffle and I added a side of Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese is absolutely delicious. I could eat a whole pan of that stuff. It's perfect cafeteria style Mac and incredibly cheesy. Loved every bite of it! The chicken was also really good! It came out piping hot and the batter they fried it in was really good and the meat was very moist and tender. The size of the breast too was huge I couldn't finish both of them. The waffle was alright, I personally didn't like the syrup because I felt like it was WAY too sweet for my taste. I certainly didn't eat it with the chicken and waffle because it would have ruined it for me. Other people at my table had the smothered chicken and it looked SO good! Definitely trying on my next time. The prices were pretty reasonable about 9-13 bucks a plate depending on how hungry you are. The only complaints I have were the bathrooms were really dirty both Women's and men's.  Someone had thrown up all over the men's bathroom and it had definitely been there awhile. Also, the parking is horrendous! The hotel next to it owns most of the parking  sans probably like 10 spaces so we ended up having to park across the street on the road. They do offer complimentary valet parking though. I would say I would definitely come back- the food was great!",

Most of the table was done eating at that point since we were starving because of the over hour wait for our order.  Nickle and dimed us for extras on the bill too, pretty bold of them to do that after such a terrible experience.   Chicken was obviously under a heat lamp for quite some time, as it came out dried up and completely dead. Half of our table's food was cold, the other half was mediocre at best.  Just a horrible experience. I would never, ever come back here, nor would I ever suggest anyone go here.   I cannot express in words how bad of an experience this was. Over two hours for dead food and not even a visit from the manager to apologize for what a horrendously bad establishment this is.",

The fish was so crunchy it was like eating fish chips. The greens were definitely out the can, all stems. By the way the place was empty on a Sunday afternoon I guess more than myself have caught on. The line use to be out the door. The bar (dishwasher) area backed up all over the floor 2x and they were spraying bleach. It took them 15-20 min just to recognize us and take our order.

First of all, I LOVE FRIED CHICKEN. I'd like to say that I KNOW fried chicken.   I ordered the 3 piece chicken meal, which came with two sides. I opted for the collard greens, dirty rice and I paid extra for Mac and cheese. My entree arrived with a large cornbread. The cornbread was the highlight of my dinner...  Service was very friendly and quick. And it seemed as soon as I ordered, my fiber arrived! Poof! 5 minutes! That's supah-lightning fast for 3 large pieces of fried chicken....my chicken was obviously pre-made and sitting sadly somewhere, which is what it tasted like. Cold, not crispy, not juicy, very dry. The greens and the rice were also cold and almost tasteless. The mac and cheese although cold, had really good flavor. The cornbread was really good, dense and full of corn bits.  Honestly, maybe I hyped this place up too much because I was expecting to be blown away by the fried chicken. Maybe I should've asked for a new batch. I likely won't be back though.",

So let's give it another try I say! I got two breasts waffle, red beans and some spinach. The chicken was so overcooked....damn. sent it back.  The red beans tasted like and looked like chili beans.....definitely not red beans.  On a positive side I got an awesome mai tai! Also has the manager come out and we discussed the meal.

Like it's almost laughable I don't know if Lo Los and the hotel next door got some issues they need to work out but how is almost every parking spot other than the valet(ha you thought I was gonna pay a valet bruh...sike) says hotel parking. You wanna pay for the valet go ahead but if not you better park across the street. Off the soapbox the food is so damn good. I got the chicken gizzards as an appetizer and they were excellent. They fry them perfectly and I mean perfectly because a lot of places fry them to long and they can be tough to eat. They are the best gizzards I have ever had at a restaurant. For the main course I had the Lo Los special which is a 3 piece and two waffles. The chicken is SOO crispy, and flavorful once again fried to perfection and you can taste the seasoning in every crispy bite. Next the waffle, I really didn't expect much from the waffles but that was the biggest surprise of the whole meal. They sneak nutmeg and cinnamon in the waffle mix and you catch a hint of it with every bite. It gives it a much fuller taste than a regular waffle. The combination along with their chicken is amazing. I don't care that the parking situation here blows like category 5 hurricane winds the food is A1 and I'll be back to explore the rest of the menu.",

Diamond was super sweet, accomodating, and relatable. I hope the managers know what a commodity they have in Diamond. Probably won't be back to Arizona any time soon.... But when in AZ, this is definitely one of those restaurants that you MUST hit up. I am sure everyone else is just as kind and attentive as she was, but the next time that I am in town, I will be looking for Diamond.",

I had the Lil Amadi ($7): the waffle was soft with a hint of cinnamon and the two thighs were crunchy && flavorful! My sister had Malaysia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger (12) && she liked it. My parents both had a Soulfood Platter ($15 each). The two pieces of catfish were at least 8\" each, the chicken fried chicken was huge, about 6-8\" in diameter. Each of the sides came in a generous portion as well. Fried okra, mac n cheese, whipped potatoes && fries.   I barely finished my one waffle && two thighs. My appetite isn't small either. My sister finished her burger but neither of my parents finished their meals. The price is good for the amount of food you receive.   We're considering coming back again before we head out of town.",

I have bee to both locations in Scottsdale and in Gilbert. The Gilbert location is nice and quaint but can feel costa phobic in the dinning area. Get there at a reasonable time, specially on the weekend or expect a wait. The Scottsdale location in Old Town Scottsdale is awesome, spacious nice bar with out side views and for some reason the food at the Scottsdale location is better, same recipe but better taste for some reason at the Scottsdale location. I highly suggest trying it out if you are a chicken and waffles person like myself and the coolaide is to die for, I suggest the \"red,\" yes it goes by color not flavor.",

    "text": "5 stars for the wonderful service our waiter, Garrett, gave us. Very attentive while we were waiting for our food. Introduced us to the restaurant manager, who is very personable, you can tell that he projects his positive energy to his staff - loved hearing his success story. Definitely the servers contribute greatly to this establishment. Ours made us feel right at home. Those, he introduced us to, made us feel welcome and talked to us like we were old friends (in our case, old friends of their parents).  4 stars for the environment, it was too loud for us. Likely 5 stars for the young at heart. This place is very upbeat and busy. The bar has several sports events playing. I went on a Friday night and they had a DJ playing the top hit songs. Not a place to go for quiet conversations. There is a patio area, but not sure if that's any quieter, my husband wanted to watch the basketball game at a table vs. the bar.  3 stars for the Blackened Fish, apparently, when they say \"blackened\" it means charcoal cooked and not seasoned with pepper and other sauces. I took a bite out of it and I got a mouthfull of char-burnt fish, yuck. The menu should actually stipulate the difference and not leave it for the waiters or manager to explain. It was topped with 3 shrimp and served with rice & vegetables, which was good. I also had the Fried Green Tomatoes and a side of 1 flapjack, it was absolutely delicious. The chicken breast and waffle were good too. They do have deserts there,we ordered the peach cobbler and bread pudding that had slices of banana in it. It was good. Several menu items to choose from and I'm definitely interested in trying other foods there.  2-3 stars for the cocktails. Ordered the melon mojito, which was just a pricey order of 7-up with mint leaves and the Blue Ivy seemed like they just served Blue Kool-Aid (I had a taste of it). I'm not a big drinker & like when it's blended/mixed so well that you can't taste the alcohol but I could usually tell if there was at least something.  1 star for parking...Hard to find parking in their very small parking lot. Most if it is for the hotel guest, next door.   It does get busy and large parties will likely have to wait. They do not take any reservations but you can order ahead for take out.",

If it wasn't for the delicious chicken I would never have come back time and time again. But enough is enough. The service is complete hog wash. Been here at least 10 times and the service is no better if not worse every time. No smiles, no greeting no personality. I really hate being so critical of the service. But you are in the service industry, SERVE!!!! It seems pretty rare to me to not see one happy worker. Not to mention not to see a manager anywhere on the floor. No systems in place. Our server shouldn't be waiting tables on opposite sides of the building. How can she give the attention needed to her customers?  Took 15-20 mins to get ketchup after asking a 3rd person. By the time the ketchup came food was already cold. Food is great, but your service should match your food.  Updated****** I'd like to thank the management and staff for stepping their game up. We haven't been for awhile but I just couldn't resist coming back to give y'all one more shot......AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELVES. The service was on point and the food was amazing. Happy to say we will be frequent patrons again. So glad to have my breakfast spot back.",

Before I even ordered anything, he told me I didn't have to order a salad, and that if I order some real food he won't judge me. His snarky comments, impatience, and rude attitude culminated into a terrible experience -- so much so that we couldn't even enjoy the food because we had become so enraged and just wanted to leave. I'm sure the food tastes just fine, but the sour taste of a disgusting attitude was all we left with. No amount of supposedly good food can bring me back to eat at this place.",

I have never witnessed anything like this in a restaurant... Wait--one time at a car dealership that I also vowed never to give my business to again. An employee gave notice and was saying good-bye to her coworkers, very subtly. He came and asked her to leave or he would call the police--seriously??  In front of people eating dinner. He came out a second time and asked her if she would leave on her own or he had to bring the police. I would not have known she had given notice had he not made a fuss. It was that subtle. Seems like overkill and extremely unprofessional to humiliate her in front of patrons. I can't say I blame her if this is how he treats employees. I even spoke on her behalf and he was rude to me--a paying customer. Of course he never apologized and went back into his cave. Get rid of this manager.",

So we stopped in of a week night and ordered up dinner.  One humongous hamburger and a fish dish to be exact.  The burger apparently went over pretty well with the hubs, and my fish was good, but not well...great.  The latter had a healthy portion of fish over a spoonful of rice, veggies and lukewarm sauce.  Lemonade was sickenly sweet - couldn't drink it.  Overall, it's pretty pricey for what you get - disappointingly so.  We escaped, including beverages and a modest tip, for just under $50.

A lady that worked there walked up to me and told me that she noticed my boots from the other stall and that she picked up my paper towels that I had thrown down on the floor ! I was shocked first of all that while enjoying my dinner she would walk up and accuse me of being disgusting lazy and trifling . No she wasn't my server and no she didn't have to go out of her way to say anything to me especially if she didn't see me do any of that but just happened to see my boots while she was popping a squat . It made me mad and uncomfortable . Everyone else was very professional & attentive . My food was ok my chicken salad came out with ONE chicken strip on it ! Then they brought more chicken over that was very over cooked .I don't know if I'll return.",

Seriously, and all they did for us was take 2 meals off the bill....I should have called the board of health on those guys.  Terrible!  Not even an apology.  The manager never came to even speak to us.  Where was the person that looks at the food before it comes out?  terrible let alone very unsafe.",

I've been a server for years and I understand a stressful busy environment, but frankly for this establishment there is no excuse. We waited 20 minutes to simply be greeted and order drinks. The ladies next to us waited 30 minutes, then an additional 20 just to get drinks. Multiple people got up and walked out because they weren't served at all. This was the case for not only the tables but the bar and the bartenders as well. The bartender was in a five foot vicinity of its customers and they still weren't being helped. The worst part was there was NO SENSE OF URGENCY whatsoever. Servers and bartenders strolled along seemingly oblivious to the fact that people were complaining and walking out. Witnessed multiple people complain to their server and nothing changed. No hustle, no teamwork. Had to flag down 3 waitresses to simply get hot sauce and silverware. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and angry. I will not be returning simply for the horrible service myself and those around me received, and this is coming from someone in the industry. Lolo's needs to seriously reevaluate the staff as a whole or you will lose the business that you deserve when you have great food. You definitely lost more than a few customers today.",

The service was some of the worst I have every received. The hostest was so unfriendly and down right rude. We sat at the bar while we waited for our table, the bartenter wasn't much friendlier. We asked to speak with a manager because of the rude service and the bartender said he was the manager. When the concern was brought to his attention he made excuses for her and said she has a tough job. Never apologized.  My wife and I are very friendly people and the service was so awful. The server also was lacking people skills. It doesn't matter how good the food is (its just alright) the service alone will keep me away for good. I will give a place a second chance but the fact every employee made you feel unwelcome was to much for me. When the unpleasantness was brought to the staffs attention there were no apology but they made excuses. Don't bother at this place, you can get good chicken elsewhere.",

Even though we sat next to the kitchen entrance, waiters passed by us continuously and never stopped to get us drinks or take our order. It was happening to another table and the decided to leave. After about 12 minutes someone came over and asked if we were being neglected. He was an awesome waiter and every waiter in this world should strive to be like him. Friendly, understanding, knew the menu by heart, attentive, all-round great person! Lo-Lo's would have gotten 2 stars from me if it wasn't for him.  We came for the Chicken and only the chicken! He provided us with so many chicken options  for all of us to be satisfied with what we ordered the way we wanted it. He came back in less than 5 minutes with all the chicken. But how? So quick? We had such a variety of pieces ordered. I thought AH CRAP, pre-cooked, reheated, or microwaved! But it wasn't. It was very crispy outside, juicy inside, and the right temperature all around with a really good flavor. We don't know how the cooks did it and the waiter wouldn't tell us. And the Mac'n'cheese is thick and cheesy!!! It was so good!  When the bill came, my meal was missing. I called him over and told him the check was wrong and missing my meal. He said not to worry about it since we were neglected and wanted to make up for it. I said it was alright, the chicken made up for the wait. He insisted though. Next time we are in Scottsdale we will be back!!!!",

    "text": "Being born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, it has made it extremely hard to be lenient when it comes to soul food and my southern favorites. I'm from a city that is known for their music, hospitality and food (especially the hot chicken). In other words, I know good chicken like a choir director knows his keys.   After my experience at Lo-Lo's (twice now), I can definitely say this is as close to good soul food one is going to find here in The Valley. (that I have tried at least).  The chicken and waffles were pretty good, chicken could have had more seasoning and been crunchier but it was still edible and decent, waffle was alright but it could of been much fluffier. My side items were also lacking a little seasoning but like I said, this is Phoenix, AZ so we gotta accept what we have when it comes to soul food.  Lo-Lo's is not the best in the food department but the service is OUTSTANDING. My server my last visit was extremely friendly, all smiles, and provided GREAT conversation. Bartender was also very pleasant and the food runner was a delight as well. I didn't have to ask or want for anything. My only complaint is it took them FOREVER to finally send our server over to take our orders and the restaurant wasn't packed.   However, I still have yet to find somewhere here in the valley that fills the void of my southern heart. I will probably be yearning for good chicken until I go back to Nashville one day, but until then, these lackluster places will have to do.  Lo-Lo's has a wonderful vibe though and great interior, they even have a DJ playing all the old school jams making you and your party feel like you're vibing at a bingo night.   In my opinion, Lo-Lo's is leaps and bounds better than tacky, overrated, poor-service Roscoe's Chicken N Waffles of Los Angeles.",

    "text": "Chicken and waffles is such a southern thing and yet I never partook during the number of years I lived in Atlanta. Not having a reference for the southern cuisine, I tried Lo-Lo's. I had the basic chicken and waffle and I don't know how they make their waffles, but it is absolutely amazing and the syrup is to die for. I enjoyed the chicken as well - not as much as the waffle, but it was a good combination none the less. It's a great treat now and then so I would recommend it if you are craving some good comfort food!",

Seeing that fried chicken is one of my absolute favorite foods, I had to find out what this city had to offer. Not only was this some of the best fried chicken I'd ever had, but the whole experience was so awesome that we ate at The the restaurant every day we were there and practically every meal! The staff was the absolute best too, so friendly and accommodating, I can hardly wait to visit again!",

The hostess was cheerful and seated us right away. Our server, Latisha, greeted us within a minute or two and took our drink order. I got a grape Kool-aid and the hubby got a Blue Ivy cocktail. My drink was cold and tasted like my childhood (I don't drink Kool-aid really ever anymore).  We ordered the fried green beans as an appetizer. They were very tasty especially with the dipping sauce that came with it.  I ended up ordering the Phat Azz samich with chicken and a side of corn. Hubby got the red velvet pancakes and a chicken breast. The food came out before we finished out appetizer; it was great.  My chicken was crispy, crunchy, and juicy and the corn was delicious. Hubby liked his pancakes (I tasted them too and they were delicious).  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the windows didn't seem to have shades on them and the setting sun made for a blinding experience where we were seated.",

I went on a Tuesday night and there was a podcast being recorded in the restaurant which made for a pretty loud environment. I asked several servers why that was the case and none could even name the podcast show so...yeah.  Anywho, the service was mediocre and so was the food. I saw another couple leave because it took so long for a server to acknowledge them. Either the result of being understaffed or poor training.   Nonetheless, this is a chain restaurant so I'm sure I would visit again if I was in the mood for what they offer but I'll be lowering my expectations moving forward.",

    "text": "Summary:  Lack of customer service, toilet tasting water, funny tasting Lemonade, long wait no matter how many people, unsanitary, and no food quality control.   Detailed:  August 21, 2019: I had not eaten anything all day. Friends invited me to Lo-Lo's. At the restaurant, we were not greeted when entering (no one was at the front). After waiting a couple of minutes, our waitress sat us down. Not many people in the restaurant so I didn't understand the wait. We sat in the corner booth where the lightning wasn't so great (only booth available).  I got a lemonade and a water. Lemonade had a weird after taste and the water was straight up tap/toilet water.  I ordered the Aunt Portia's Chicken Omelette. We waited over 30 mins for the food to come out. Food comes out and waitress leaves. Doesn't come back to check up on us. I dug into my omelette and automatically realized that it was cold. It was obvious that it had been sitting somewhere for a while. I was too hungry so I continued to eat. After my third bite, I noticed a weird taste from the omelette. I figured it was just me and I kept eating. Still no check up from the waitress. Half way done, I decided to take a snap of my food to post it on to my Snapchat story. Took the pic and used flash. That's when I saw something weird under the cheese of the omelette. I peeled off the cheese and there it was.  The omelette was green and looked rotten (see attached pics). I didn't realize the omelette was green because of the lighting. Still no check up from waitress. My friends think they are boogie af and were embarrassed but I was not going to keep my mouth shut. I asked some other waitress to get our waitress. I complain and hand her the plate. Someone else comes out (I'm assuming the night manager/shift lead) and asks \"who's omelette was that\" with a concerned/slight disgust look on her face. I say \"mine\". She asked if I would like for them to remake it again and I said \"no\". At that point, I was disgusted and wanted to get the hell out of there.   DO NOT EAT HERE. It's not worth it. They also charge $3 for ONE chicken leg... go to KFC/Popeyes. At this point, KFC/Popeyes is healthier, faster and cheaper.  A health inspector needs to come to this restaurant. This place is unsanitary and disgusting. The people were nice though.   PSA: Do not eat here. If you do inspect your food!",

    "text": "First, I'm a Southern Girl who can COOK.  I'm also the god daughter of a lauded professional chef.  In short, I know good food and I'm hyper critical when it comes to not only taste, but also service and presentation. I'd heard about the legendary food and long lines at LoLo's, so I hadn't made it in.   First, to avoid the crowds, go on Tuesday.   Second, the setting is like a comfy diner ...with cozy booths, smiling staff and just the right energy for you to feel welcomed.   Third, the menu is darlingly eclectic with dishes named after folk and burgers with hilarious names (I shoulda taken a pic), but I was too busy oooohing over the options.   I settled on the chicken fried chicken which was a huge breast with this so yummy you wanna bathe in it gravy. I had mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes (yes, two carbs ...I ignored my diet it was worth it!) I also had a great, crispy coleslaw that was the perfect balance of crunch and flavor.  The meal came with a huge, dayyyum it's good muffin.   I was too full for dessert, but I did save room for a second Georgia Peach Cocktail.  It's made with a peach infused vodka which was ok, but I much preferred the second when I asked for just Ciroc. With a full bar, I hey can whip up just about any cocktail.  Last, I'm glad I tried this place. But I'm surprised by some of the Yelp Reviews I just read. I think some folk have preconceived notions when it comes to comfort food/Soul Food.   This wasn't my cooking or my dad's, but that's what you have to expect when dining out. It's an op to see how another chef interprets a dish. Go in with a curiosity and respect for someone else's vision. And if you spend $10 at a fast food restaurant for pre frozen and in my opinion unbearably nasty food, why do you begrudge paying $20 for a full meal, cooked to order, and served on a plate?!",

I've been to their first spot in Phoenix back when they first opened, and to Mrs. White's- so I know they strive and thrive. Unfortunately we were greeted by a rude hostess after trying to no avail to find parking. There are zero parking spaces available for LoLo's patrons due to the motel they share the property with. There is only a valet option, and that parking is limited, so I'm not sure how they possibly accommodate their patrons. The wait time on Yelp said 8-12 minutes and we arrived around 2pm well after the lunch or brunch crowd. We saw several empty tables, some clean, some dirty. The hostess grabbed a dirty wet rag that was laying on the desk, I assumed to clean a table for us, asked how many were in our party, then walked off. She returned, asked for our telephone number to notify us when a table would be ready. We asked how long, she answered 25 minutes. We were confused and walked the block back to our car to wait in cool place. We waited for about 30 minutes, and finally left. Never received a call or text that a table was waiting. It was also so warm inside the restaurant, I'm not sure we would have been comfortable eating. Very disappointing.",

We waited 25 minutes and nobody came to take our order. We had to flag someone down ... multiple times.   After we ordered, food came out fast.

    "text": "My husband and I were visiting from Charlotte, NC. One of my sisters has talked very highly of this restaurant so we decided to go with her and see what it was about. There were four of us. When we arrived, there was a little bit of a wait but that's no problem with us. We were seated quicker than expected which was a nice surprise. The staff was all very friendly which is a great thing as always.   Our waiter was super busy and it took him a while to get to us. When he did, he made sure we got our drinks before he did anything else. I ordered water, my husband was crazy and decided to try the purple kool-Aid! My sister and her boyfriend both ordered the sweet tea. Everyone loved their drinks. I tried my husbands Kool-Aid and it was super sugary which was too much for me but I know he loved it! The sweet tea was pretty good! Still too sugary for my taste!   We ordered a good deal of food. I don't remember the name of all of our food. The online menu is not the same as the menu you are handed at the restaurant. I had 3 choices picked out and ALL 3 were not on the menu. When I asked about it I was told that the menu is old and out dated. If that's the case, take it down. It's not that hard to do. So there goes a star.   Our food took a long time to make. That's fine. I understand they were busy but there were tables that got filled after us and were getting their food long before we were getting ours. When asked about it, our server kept saying the kitchen is backed up. We had been waiting 45 minutes. There goes another star.   The food was not what I was hoping for. My eggs were over cooked. The potato's were bland and the grits were a huge disappointment. Better grits can be found at a restaurant called Butters. My husbands chicken was really dry. He liked the seasoning but it's kind of hard to enjoy the chicken when it's dry. My sisters boyfriend order was good. He enjoyed it but also said his 2 pieces of chicken were dry. The waffles were something he loved. My sister ordered the French toast and it was a little funky. Food being dry and over cooked was another reason for a star lost.   I was a little disappointed and I know my sister was since she talked so much about it. She usually goes to the other location but wanted to try this one since it was closer to us. It was worth a try but I don't plan to come back. The restaurant has a neat vibe to it. Wish the food was better during our visit.",

    "text": "So this is our go-to place for a cheat meal!  Fun atmosphere with family or friends or if you're dining solo, heck - sit at the bar!  On weekends when we have gone for lunch, they have a DJ playing fun jams.  Fried chicken is yummy and the adult beverages are on point.  Great spot for day drinking and eating if you ask me.    We've had the fried chicken (obviously), rotisserie, Chyna's honey hot wings (dry).  All yum and often times we don't have room for the corn bread, although it too is yummy!  I would rate overall 3.5 because service has been hit or miss.  Front of the house could use some help, but I do think most of the servers are friendly and helpful.  I actually think the service has been great for us when we have sat outside or at the bar.    So I would totes recommend coming here if you're in the mood for some fried chicken.  And if you're visiting and need soveniers for the fam, check out their t-shirts!",

This time I got the soul food dinner with fried chicken and catfish, Mac and cheese, and collard green and even though I got white meat when I asked for dark the plate was still amazing. Everything about the food was on point but the Mac and cheese is some of the best Mac and cheese I've had at a restaurant!   Definitely save room for dessert or get it to go because the red velvet and banana pudding will speak to your soul. Gotta try the suck it to me cake next time I'm here",

Being raised in the south, I love to try a southern themed restaurant whenever I can, especially if I'm in another region of the country. Some of my friends and I took a trip to the closest Lo-Lo's before leaving Phoenix and we all enjoyed our visit! If you're looking for some sweet tea, come to Lo-Lo's they make it right! They also have Kool-aid on the menu and comes with three flavors; fruit punch, watermelon, and grape.   For lunch, I wanted to try the main advertisement; chicken and waffles. I went with the menu item, Lo-Lo's since it came with three pieces of fried chicken and two good sized waffles. The chicken came out perfect, and had delicious seasoning and it wasn't dry at all! The waffles were fluffy and came with some syrup and butter. The portion was just right and the price wasn't bad either.  There are a few locations around Arizona, and we were told that the location in downtown Scottsdale gets pretty busy. This location wasn't too busy, so service was great! If I return to Phoenix again, I will return to Lo-Lo's.",

I order the famous soul food platter with a chicken thigh and fried fish  Mac and cheese and yams! This is True southern food, between the a little over the top salt content in the chicken, paired with the over baked 3 cheese macaroni and the juicy sweet yams I was amazed! I LOVED EVERYTHING! I would have love to pair my fish with a tartar sauce for extra flavor but it good just liked that. I did also get a whipped cream blue vodka drink which was amazing however a little on the sweeter side for me ! I went right before peak hours so the restaurant was not as crowded and the food came out relatively quickly. Two of the manager came and spoke to me which I am always a fan off! I will always recommend and visit again!",

If you are looking for some True southern fried chicken (gravy and onions optional), collard greens, fried okra,  cornbread muffins cooked with creamed corn, macaroni and waffles, then this is the place for you.  It is connected with the legendary Mrs. Whites from downtown so you can get over priced koolaid as well.  The food is filling and heavy so I wouldn't get another small wing for $3.  The place has a great atmosphere with pics of history and family.  The menu names will make you smile and the food you eat will make you happy.  You can't go wrong if you are craving some good down home eats.  However, you might need to see your Primary Care Physician if you eat here too often!",

The building is so much nicer and has a great open feel with a fun vibe and music playing to keep the mood up.  I recently started a diet so this was one of my last meals and it didn't let me down.  I went with the Chicken fried chicken, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes with corn bread.    The chicken fried chicken is actually the reason this didn't get 5 stars.  I expect when you order chicken at a place like this for it to be perfect and blow you away.  the breading was a little too much and the edges got overcooked and the chicken breast was a little dry.  The mac and cheese could have been a little creamier, seemed like it was left over from the day before and reheated, not the best but good flavor.  Potatoes were super smooth and seasoned perfect.  The corn bread was also perfect with a little bit of butter and honey.  all in all I walked away feeling fat and happy and will definitely return!",

Chicken is so juicy and the batter is crispy and seasoned done right. You usually get two sides and you can't go wrong with any of them (and there's plenty to choose from). We always get a side of collard, Mac n cheese, cheesy grits, corn, green beans and of course their cornbread. We've tried them all and these are by far our favorites. Haven't gotten around to ordering dessert because the food was so good and bountiful that we are so stuffed we have to always pass on dessert. I see you peach cobbler, next time I will limit myself, I'll try.   But the last few visits I've been ordering their fried catfish. You get two HUGE filets! 2! TWO! Dos! Dalawa (for my Filipinos!)! It's about the size of the plate they serve it in. Crazy! But you know your girl ate it all. Every single crumb of it! Gone! And I washed it down with .... yup... grape Koolaid!!! They serve Koolaid on tap in tons of different flavors!!! How can they get any cooler? Endless refills and delicious comfort food, I love this place!!! It always is a special place in my heart. They remind me of home and how my family would eat dinner and have that huge pitcher of Koolaid. Thank you Lo Lo's for creating these memories for my own family.   To Larry \"Lo-Lo\",  How do I get you to open one in Orange County, CA. Please please please open one there!!! I'm telling you, you would be a huge hit because we don't have anything like you guys out where I live. I love coming to Scottsdale only for the purpose of eating at your restaurant. Please consider opening one near me!!! I swear you will be loved in my neighborhood!!   Your fans in California , Ellis Family",

As a result, they also have complementary but forced valet because they want to define hotel vs restaurant parking. Was a bit annoying though because it looked to me like there was enough spaces for everyone to park themselves. Anyways..  We got inside and there was no wait (yay!) around 11am on a Sunday. We were promptly seated and looked over the menu. It took our waiter a minute to greet us but he was apologetic and look clearly overwhelmed. He was nice and got our drinks back to us shortly after. We had coffee, cranberry juice and unsweetened tea.   Two of us ordered the Double D (two breast and a waffle) and my friend ordered the Toy Toy which came with two wings and a waffle. We also ordered a side of Mac n cheese and whipped potatoes to try. The chicken and waffles came with butter and syrup. I thought the food was fantastic. The chicken was really good, crispy and not overly greasy. The waffles had awesome flavor and together it was a heavenly combo. The Mac n cheese was pretty solid and the potatoes were seasoned and fairly tasty. I'd order the Mac n cheese again but probably not the potatoes.   Overall I was happy with the meal but service was a bit slow. Our waiter was nice but it took awhile to get checks and he definitely seemed stressed. The valet was kind of annoying too but the food was worth it. I would definitely return.",

I had a salad with bacon on it and avocado also and pieces of boneless fried chicken. I almost wanna cry just thinking about it because it was so good. I put some of their house brand hot sauce on the chicken, wow that was good.   Our server was so kind, I love her to death, she was just good vibes. The decor was cool also and the location was just a few steps away from the hotel I stayed at. My parents loved the food so much they went there the next day also.   The waffle was amazing, I ate some of my mom's, and I loved the banana bread pudding for desert. Wow! Great spot, I can see now why they're a success. I would go here all the time if I was local.",

I honestly can't believe it took me as long as it did to come in! This place is amazing! I'm not a huge fan of waffles in general, but figured I needed to try it once. They were so good! The chicken strips were moist and flavorful, without being greasy. The kool-aid was an added bonus!   My next trip in, I tried the macaroni and cheese, and fries instead of the waffle. Both were great as well! The macaroni was smooth and perfectly cheesy, and the fries were seasoned to perfection. My friend had the Double D, and that was great as well.  I highly recommend this place; I've been talking about it non-stop to my parents back home, and can't wait for them to come into town so I can take them here.  My only complaint would be the parking lot. I mean really? Valet for that tiny parking lot really doesn't make sense. And it's annoying trying to find somewhere to park on a Friday night.",

The waffles were thin enough to be crunchy, just how I like it. The cheese grits? Hard pass. It's literally melted cheese and a block of butter on plain grits. I was expecting grits cooked with cheese and butter, yes it does make a difference. Huge difference. The kool aid was sweet. Like slap of diabetes sweet. All the waiters were great except for mine. She dropped off my food and she was staring at the door. When I said thank you, she must have realized I was there and said enjoy your meal, to the door. She dropped off my check and a to go box. But another waitress had to pick up my check and get me a larger to go box. I wanted a bag to put my to go box in, I guess after I pay I don't get anymore help because she was no where to be seen.

It was a TINY piece, not to mention,  it tasted like it had been sitting on the counter for two weeks.  Just horrible.    Not convinced to return to this location.",

Employees are inside, but don't open the door. One time I called that night in hopes to let the owners know, but the manager that was working the AM shift answered and said he couldn't find the keys. Seems to be a consistent problem since this is the 4th time (not exaggerating) this has happened. It's a shame because it's a nice place with great breakfast. Ever time this has happened, they lose the 8-10 customers waiting outside to US Egg across the street. Hope the owner finds out and fires the AM manager for clearly not caring about this business or reputation.",

I believe they were over cooked because the coating has a slight burnt flavor (not bad, but not light and crispy). And then there was the lack of meat. Must be buying skinny chickens!  On a plus side the Mac-and-Cheese was good; cheesy, rich, and done just right. The fried okra was very good too. Crispy, with a cornmeal batter, and not a hit of the okra-snots (if you like okra, you know what I'm talking about).",

Regular menu has plenty to choose from, but mostly southern classics - salmon croquettes, mac-n-cheese, fried green beans, and of course Chicken & Waffles.  If you aren't interested in the fried items, they also have salads, burgers, etc.  I've had only one of their lighter options, the egg white omelet, which is extremely tasty.  Seating is plentiful and spacious.  But if you come on weekend, still expect a wait. Classic R&B in the background helps to set the tone.  Saturday afternoons they even have live DJs.",

It was later in the day about 1:00pm on a Saturday.  Initially the restaurant was busy but not more then our previous trips.  We were told it would be a 25 minute wait to be seated for our party of six.  At about 35 minutes we asked how much longer and she said she was getting a table ready and even pointed to it.  She gave it away abut 15 minutes later.  We asked again.  Same thing.  At this point the restaurant was at about 50% capacity.  We got a table after reminding her again for a third time and then got our waitress who seemed to be on the same slow regimen as the hostess.  We put in our order.  Time slipped by and we told our waitress we were concerned.  The \"chef\" came out and I told him we were dissatisfied and he argued with me that the order had been put in 37 minutes earlier and they had a large party outside.  I told him we had been there for 90 minutes total in the restaurant and he was less then sympathetic.  In fact I felt he was quite put out by us. Now I cook waffles at home and I'm sure the collard greens are made in large quantities before hand so I'm not sure even 37 minutes is necessary to get the food to the table and I believe the whole experience was a series of small errors in the flow from the hostess to the waitress to the kitchen but to deny there was an issue and blame it on us degraded the experience to the point where we cancelled our order and left hungry.  So how low can you go? Lo-lo's!",

Aaron my waiter showed up within a few minutes and took my drink request. I was going to get chicken until I saw someone else get the French toast.  My order came really fast. I like the fact that you can get breakfast anytime of the day. OMG my french toast melted in my mouth!!!!! Aaron was very attentive and checked up on me a lot.

I would understand if it was busy but that's not a big inconvenience in the long run. The chicken was moist and juicy. It was good by itself, but not combined with the waffle since that took away the taste. The waffles were just... waffles. There wasn't anything special about the two together, but that may be because I never really was into the chicken and waffle craze. Parking was a bit difficult to find because it is right next to a hotel and a lot of the spots are reserved, but after circling a few times, we got lucky and found one.",

Came here for lunch and we were seated almost immediately (the spring training game was still playing, but from what we heard the place gets nuts at other times). I ordered some blue Kool-Aid and Lo-Lo's which is two chicken and two waffles. Out waiter was nice he wasn't the most personable, but he was hustling so many tables I didn't mind I was in good company regardless. The Kool-Aid was so so so good! I haven't had Kool-Aid this good in a long time. It was a hot day and it literally hit the spot. The chicken was good and the waffles were nice and fluffy. I've had chicken and waffles before and I'll admit this isn't the best chicken and waffles I've ever had (that award is still Roscoes in So Cal), but man was it close! Good location and I was stuffed. I will definitely revisit this place again if I am back in this area again!",

Lolo's has responded by blocking off the few spots that they do own with VALET parking.  The result, you end up paying as much to park as you do for one of their breakfasts.  Sad day.

Living in Southern California there are plenty of places to get fried chicken, and many of them have waffles included, but the only one worth going to is Roscoe's, which is a must for anyone visiting SoCal.   However, the first time I tried Lo-Lo's, my mind was fuckin' blown away. They literally blow Roscoe's out of the water. I have NEVER had a bad experience with the service or the food at Lo-Lo's and if I could, I would eat that shit EVERY fuckin day! The chicken is so juicy and so tender while the outside is crispy and not flaky or drowning in oil like at so many other fried chicken joints. Their mac-n-cheese was also mouth watering with the globs of cheese they cover it in and their biscuits that were drowning is sausage gravy are as soft and fluffy as Charmin.   That being said, the absolute BEST part that won me over and is literally making me want to visit Arizona at least once a month JUST to eat at Lo-Lo's was their gat damn grape Kool-Aid!! Holy mother of all things delicious!! This shit was the perfect combination of Kool-Aid, sugar, and ice cubes. I seriously wanted to buy a gallon of this stuff to take back home. If it's a hot summer day and you're thirsty as fuck then this shit will quench your thirst like it's the first time you've ever had liquid in your body. Don't think about visiting this joint just fuckin' do it and thank me later.",

I loved this diner as soon as I stepped through the doors and was greeted by the incredibly friendly staff. Everyone here is so nice! The hostess gave us a hearty hello and the energy continued with the server.   I ordered an omelet which is very hefty in size and tasted delicious! They have a brand new location which is spacious and friendly. You must visit Lo-Lo's and even if you don't want chicken and waffles, you can still enjoy other items! This breakfast is definitely large and in charge!",

    "text": "First time here.  I was motivated to try this place because Yelp sent some email about waffles.  On the list was Lo-Lo's.  Well, you know how that goes.  It gets into your head and you gotta try it.  Saturday is my non-cooking day, but it wasn't the smartest thing to show up at Lo Lo's on a Saturday night.  Yikes,  the line was out the door, into their patio, into the parking lot and up the street (just kidding about the street)  Went to check in to give my name and number in the party but had to wait because too many people were fussing about the wait and who got there first, etc.  Luckily the owner (I think; lady with short red hair) was a strong yet polite lady and explained that the 50-60 minute wait was what it was.  If it was shorter, good, but she couldn't guarantee that.  People don't like to hear the truth.  I was prepared to face up to my stupidity of coming on a Saturday night when there is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday.  So I KNEW I was waiting and I would be waiting until people finished smacking their lips on that delish fried chicken and everything else.  But No.  People gotta fuss.  Speaking of fussing, a woman slid in front of me and when the check-in lady looked at both of us to figure out who was there first, the woman said to me,  \"I was waiting here didn't you see me?\".  My answer was \"No, I didn't.  But you go on ahead because I am not starting a scene here over a table\".  I think the owner overheard me and smiled.  Did I tell you the woman was bigger than I am?  I am no stupid chick from the Bronx.  You don't fight unless you have to and it won't be over a table.  So about 20 minutes later the owner, shall I call her Redhead, for short? motioned us over and led us to a table for four.  Nice table, I thought and not so long a wait.  She picks up the menus from the table and says, come with me, I have a better seat for you--I like you guys.  And then she led me to the almighty BOOTH.  I love Booths. I love Booths, Did I tell you I love booths?  OMG. A booth.  Thank you lord. Thank you Ms. Redhead.  I knew that stepping back and not body slamming that aggressive woman at the beginning would pay off. Did I tell you she was bigger than I am?  Did I tell you we don't fight in the Bronx unless it's for big stakes.  Yes, I believe I did.   Phase II--SITTING IN THE BOOTH: So now we order.  We got two waters and one beer.  AND WE WAITED FOREVER FOR THE WATERS.  FOREVER.  How about 20 minutes? We stopped a guy to ask him to get our waitress and then, the waters parted and our waitress was there with our waters, beer and what seemed to be everybody else's waters.  She said, Sorry it took so long, but we had to wait until the glasses were washed.  Wow.  I realize it is a packed house but at moments like these when you run out of glasses what's wrong with serving water out of a red party cup?  I wouldn't have minded especially with the generous slice of lemon they put in it.  Think about it.  I understand beer and cocktails being served in glass (BTW, they are large mason jars I forgot to tell you), but not water.  You can slide on water. Hubby ordered the chicken salad with a side of french fries.  I went on full mode pig out.  2 fried chicken thighs with a waffle AND a side of mac and cheese.   Hubby's order came out with the bacon he did NOT want.  Know anybody else who doesn't eat bacon?  I don't. Just him.  When corrected, the salad had mixed greens, half a sliced avocado and nice chunks of fried chicken.  The fries were fresh with a sprinkling of some delicious topping.  He was happy.  My thighs were not greasy (the chicken's, that is). The waffle, while thin, had a lot of flavor (maybe vanilla and cinnamon).  The mac and cheese was tasty and creamy.  What it was lacking was the crunchiness on the top and the corners.  I like the mac n cheese to have crunch on top.  This was smooth like \"Stouffers\".  Not saying it's Stouffers, just texture wise.   I totally enjoyed my gorge-fest. I finished everything on the plate.  Hubby on the other hand said that while the salad was fresh, varied and plentiful his chicken salad was not worth a repeat visit.  As always, he said he could stay home and get better food.  Yes, ladies.  That is the punishment for learning to cook and cook well.  Men are like breast fed babies when it comes to home cooked meals.  They want breast milk and will reject formulas or substitutes that are just as good.  So let's ignore hubby's assessment and trust me that the food was very good and worth a repeat visit.  Thank you Ms. Redhead for the booth and the great food.",

I had to wait to enter the restaurant until the one valet guy addressed the needs of 5 people that were leaving. Really, I Have to wait to actually spend my $$$.   We ordered an appetizer that never came and had 1 libation in 40 minutes of time at the table (the water we asked for was never brought either).   The manager came over and asked if we wanted the appetizer. Dumb solution as a manager. Of course I don't want it now, my food is at the table after a 40 minute wait and I am eating my chicken and waffle now!!!!  Poor leadership yields poor service. This place needs help or the Business will fail.   One of the worst experiences a paying customer can have.   Too many other options in town to waste my time with this place.",

Still waiting and I even finished writing this review.... 1 hope 15 min in and still waiting on food...",

Fried chicken should be cooked to order in a restaurant like this.  Waffles were soggy as though they were precooked as well. While the chicken had a good flavor, white meat was extremely dry and skin wasn't crispy though very dark brown.  Dark meat was more moist but also over cooked on the outside.  Service was average for a restaurant of this style. I probably wouldn't come back on my next trip to PHX.",

The grits and eggs were well-prepared, the waffles are served with hot syrup, but the chicken isn't very good.  It tasted old, like it had been sitting around for awhile.  Check the bucket list, no reason to go back here.

I waited an hour before for my table and they just had forgotten about me.The parking is horrible because it is a shared parking lot with a hotel. The food is great but the service has been spotty at this location.",

    "text": "On Election Day, and in the late afternoon, I had an hour to kill before an interview so I came in to get a nice cold drink and a salad to eat. Seen this place but never been and once I was in, it was quiet, somewhat empty and I was greeted immediately with a hello and a soft smile. I was seated and within minutes my server (Mike) with a smile asked how my day was going and got my drink order. I ordered an Arnold palmer and this place is the first place that asked me if I like tea or lemonade at the bottom, I was impressed. When I got my drink I was even more impressed as it came in a huge mason jar. Loved it.  I put my order in for the \"Cool Bre Bre's chicken salad\" and I asked if the chicken can be grilled instead of breaded and fried, the server said no problem.   While I waited, I went to the restroom, and I hardly ever yelp about restrooms but this one was oh lord so clean... I was impressed.   Food arrived and it looked good and delivered as ordered. Taste was okay and nothing special. The bacon bits were a great addition to the dish flavor wise but the candied walnuts were too much, or at least in my plate.   The experience wants a bad one after all. Will return hopefully for breakfast.",

The chicken was extremely bland and the gravy had the most overpowering green onion flavor. It took us so long to get our food then even longer to get our check.

LOLO's need more quality customer friendly individuals like Ahmad.  The restaurant was chaotic but after observing the manager I could see why.  The service was terrible and The waiters need to undergo a major revamp of food service skills. Glass half full you refill you check on your tables when they get their food not walk past the table 5 times before you say something. Also O saw a young man wipe the floor with a towel then honsround the corner and wipe a table. Rather he changed the towel or not it's the PERCEPTION of  your guest. As far as I concerned that was the same towel. I didnt feel it was professional for the manager to walking around drinking a beverage or having conversations to servers next to the tables if the guest. I dont want to hese your server cursing or the manager. I am utterly disgusted eont be back for while.  Again GREAT JOB AHMAD!! He has great leadership qualities.",

Sat down ordered drinks and food right away and only 3 drinks were brought to the table. 10, 15 min go by 20 min go by and 2 more drinks were delivered but...still no waters.  25 minutes go by 30 and 3 plates were brought to our table, however 2 plates were not our order. The two plates of food turned out to be for the the table of three sitting next to us. And shortly after table next to us received their 3rd plate of food. Lovely for them but Unfortunate for us we were still missing 4 out of 5 plates.  It is now 2:30. We arrived at 12:00pm. We should have walked out hours ago which is our fault,  but our god awful experience will help you make a decision to frequent another establishment to eat...anywhere else but here!  By the way, water was brought to our table right before we received our check if that makes any difference at this point in the review.  Don't eat here!",

The service is great and It seems like they are always happy to see you in there. I'm a fan of the cornbread and my go too meal is the \"Tre-Tre's\".

There was a young woman cleaning a booth whom I presume was \"the hostess.\"  She turned and saw us but did not acknowledge us. After several minutes another worker brought out a high chair for the baby in one of the waiting parties. Apparently they had to locate it from the back. After several more minutes \"the hostess\"seated the other waiting party in the booth she had just cleaned, although there were several empty booths, without ever asking their table or booth preference. The party asked to be reseated at one of several empty tables and was reseated. The woman finally asked if our party size then turned to do other things. At that point we left, convinced that the rest of the experience would be equally disappointing. There were only about ten to fifteen customers in the restaurant so no reason for the poor customer service.  It seems the business simply does not care about basic customer service. Not sure whether the food is good or not and we'll never know because we will not return. We promptly went to a competitor's restaurant where we were promptly greeted, waited only about ten minutes for a table despite their full house had a very enjoyable meal.  Lolo's owner should invest some resources in training his staff in customer service 101.",

I saw Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles on the news about how awesome they were so I really wanted to enjoy some chicken and waffles for myself. We were disappointed with the service, the food, and the prices. It took an hour for them to seat my fiance and me. Our server only talked to us twice, once to get our order and then again to give us the bill. Many tables around us were seated later than us but were finished eating before we even got our food. It felt like our server forgot to put in our order. Also, the menu was over priced for the quality food they serve. The waffles were like frozen Eggo waffles you can make at home. I've been to many local dinners better service and food than this place! I would never waste my money and time again. Don't go to this shitty restaurant!",

Super clean and decor is beautiful but casual. Ended up having lunch with the catfish and chicken with cornbread,  collard greens and fried okra.  This combo plate sounded too good to pass up and they had no problem serving it for  breakfast. The fried chicken was scrumptious and the catfish was great, neither greasy both perfectly done.  The breading was not overwelming and very  tasty.  The cornbread was  fabulous!  Moist, just a little sweet,  perfect with the  creamy butter.  The collard greens  were excellent and the fried okra was great.  Stuffed myself and walked out a happy  camper! Our server was VERY attentive, the  best  service I've had in a long time and the price, $40, tip included, was quite  reasonable for the amount of food.

For some reason now the wait is forever to get your food. Both times I've been it was close to an hour after we ordered. I realize too that they are a bit overpriced and now because of the parking and long wait times I told my husband we will find another local southern restaurant. And can the waiters please start wiping off the drinks before they serve them? Our drinks had so much condensation our entire table was wet and there were no napkins until we asked. They need to have those out on the table already. Oh and unless you get a booth be ready for your butt and back to hurt as you sit there in these weird chairs for 2.5 hours.",

It's kind of hit and miss one table gets in and out quickly while others wait. Not sure why.  We had the same food?  Servers could use some training.  After having mediocre service it is really bold of them to print a 20% tip at the bottom of the  check.  I normally do tip 20% or above for good service and a little less for poor service. That just left me feeling a little bitter.",

I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time tho, I am from out of town, I travel for work and always stay at the hotel across the street I finally tried lolos and let me tell you, it was fantastic made me think of home. My waitress a young lady, kyla, was fantastic very patient  gave me the time in the world and didn't get mad when it took me a long time to look over the huge menu, didn't kick me out the door even tho I know I was there past close she didn't act like they we're closed at all still visit my table joking around very nice and very sweet she even offered me another wine. The place was very busy and I could see her running around yet still managing to check on her tables even if it was a quick stop by with a smile, very professional. Now to the food it was fantastic I had the soul food platter and it was amazing I was so stuffed by the end of my meal. The catfish was cooked just right as the chicken was very juicy and not dry what so ever. I was pleauntly surprised when the cornbread was actually sweet cornbread with pieces of corn in it! I could eat the cornbread for days.  The portions we're very hefty and you get bang for your buck. I was very tempted to come back this morning if I didn't fly out then found out you we're also in the airport! Lastly at the end of the meal I ended up crying because I felt like I was back home and felt very welcomed and will be returning and asking for kyla and maybe try something new,tho I think I'm addicted to the soul food platter, but thank you for giving me a slice of home.",

The place has an infectious, fantastic energy in large part because every single employee is friendly, upbeat, and seems to genuinely love working there.

The \"dranks\" are so full of sugar, it turned my stomach upside down both times. A meal literally evacuated and about $25 wasted. Thanks LoLo's, I am now 10 lbs lighter than before. The \"Phat Azz Sammich\" had zero flavor. The chicken breading was moist and flaked off as I lifted it. Eww.. Who wants flaky unflavored chicken? The \"Tre Tre\" was equally underwhelming... I mean I know some people don't like salt.. But why zero salt, two cups of cinnamon and a pound of sugar in your meals? Not returning ever again.",

We woke up in the morning after a long night of alcoholic beverages and decided to go to get Chicken and Waffles because what's better than that when you only got alcohol in your system??!! I had family in town and they were very excited to eat at this place because it has a good reputation. We got there at about 12:15 they have \"free\" valet but technically you're going to have to slide the guy some change so it's not \"free\" anymore. We had a party of 8 so they lady said 45 minutes (we should of left because this is where everything bad comes). The clocked had hit 1:30 and we were still outside and everyone else was moving right in.. A party of 6 went in and a couple more went in before us and we still haven't got anything so I ask the lady what's going on it went from 45 minutes to more than a hour she replied with soon and a couple of giggles I think she thought I was joking or something. After she called us in and we sat down and our waiter said the food is going to take about a hour to come out??... I didn't understand this part I actually was very confused because we waited in line for over an hour than we have to wait another hour? Why couldn't they tell us that before we waited the hour? Why couldn't the lady go \"hey you're gonna have  about a two hour wait time with waiting for a table and food do you want to place your order now so it would be ready by the time you got a table?\" At this point we just waited it out we ordered our Foods and yes it did take an hour but what got me really mad was they brought our appetizers out like 3 minutes before brining out our food wouldn't it be smart to push this first early because of such a long wait time.. Our food came out but all in different times half the table had their food and half didn't for about 10 minutes.. With respect the people on the table waited for us to have our food also but it didn't come out so I asked for the manager and asked her how half the food can come out and the other half isn't out yet and how we waited so long and nobody told us we would have to wait over 2 hours to eat at this pathetic place. The managers response didn't have sorry or what can I do to help or something like that it was a very ignorant pathetic response I was actually very disappointed because it was the manager.. She said would you guys like dessert when my food wasn't even out yet? When would the dessert come the next day?.. The manager sucks the staff sucks the service is terrible. This place needs a makeover. I didn't even eat my food because I waited so long I lost my appetite and I was very angry. I paid the tab and left no tip and I have never done that in my life because I am a business owner and I would hate to see that but I felt like I had he right.",

According to reviews food and services were excellent.  My first hint that this may not be True was lack of diners at 5:45 PM on a Tuesday.  I shoukd have left or not gone in.  There was more employees than customers.  I guess that is why dinner cost $20 with 2 sides.   The 2 pieces of chicken (thighs) sat in grease on plate,  were dry, dark brown  (over cooked my guess), tasteless (no seasoning) ,  not  acquainted with this type of  Southern cooking.  Usually very tasty.  I ordered 2 thighs and was given leg and thigh.  Waitress exchanged by taking plate and then returning with thighs and spilt grits on plate.  Looked very unappealing.   The grits were warm and not hot enough to melt butter.  They lacked taste even with butter. My school cafeteria makes better.  Mac and cheese  staple was made with melted Velveeta.   More cheese than pasta and needed salt and pepper to even have an acceptable taste.  Again this is not seasoned  Southern Cooking.  The highlight was the greens - excellent.   Tasty and cooked to perfection.  Was not given cornbread.  I guess it would have cost more.   But as I said at beginning will not return until there is a change.",

It was the service I received that was horrible. The young lady never came back to refill my water. And when the food arrived. I didn't get utensils to eat it with for almost 5 mins before the other young lady came back.  Once I finally was able to track down my waitress. I gave her my card and asked for a to go box along with a bag. She eventually came back with a container no bag.  I felt no tip was required since I still didn't have nothing to drink after sitting in there for almost an hour. I signed the receipt and I heard her say she didn't tip. Now why would I tip and it takes nothing to refill a baby size mason jar? It will be a while before I go back to this location again. Hopefully,  next time the service will be better.",

The banana dessert was great. The menu is unique, with cute southern names for each menu item. Have had no problems with servers or hosts so far. Cons: Can be loud and crowded depending on the time of day. To be honest, this place is not disappointing but not mind blowing. Makes me wonder if Roscoe's would offer that out of this world experience. But for now while I'm stuck in AZ, Lo-Lo's will do the job.",

    "text": "If you find yourself lost in the greater Arizona area and longing for some Southern style fried chicken, scoot on over to Lo-Lo's and completely ruin yourself for any other fried chicken ever again.  This is seriously the best fried chicken place we've been to since leaving Florida, and we've been to 19 states and the District of Columbia eating our way across America. We've been to two of their locations, but here we had Deandre as our server at this one, and he was great.  Believe me when I tell you, you haven't had sweet tea until you've had it southern style (i.e. - so much sugar you almost pucker), and they do it well here.  They even serve Kool-Aid in mason jars (as with all of their drinks).  The chicken is breaded with a tantalizing blend of spices and deep fried (can I get a \"hell yeah!\"), and you can't go wrong with any of their sides. My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and I miss this restaurant more than any others since moving away from Phoenix!  I'm going to dedicate a separate paragraph (gasp!) for the banana pudding.  Scandalous, I know.  Remember all that traveling I told you about in the first paragraph?  I've never found ANYWHERE with banana pudding this good.  It's big enough to share, but we each get our own. You should too. It's that good. I haven't even found a place IN THE SOUTH with banana pudding this good, including my grandma's house (although if you tell her that I will deny it to my last breath).  I'm not going to tell you that you should make a a special Trip to Phoenix for Lo-Lo's, but you should totally make a a special Trip to Phoenix for Lo-Lo's.  Road trip?  Lo-Lo's.  Layover in Phoenix?  Extend it and go to Lo-Lo's.  Live on Earth?  Go to Lo-Lo's.",

I will cut to the chase and save most of my comments for the Phoenix/Original location.  LoLo's is down right good chicken and great waffles.  This location seems to not be as busy as the flagship location in downtown.  But, please don't think that means that this location is not busy.  At lunch time, if you arrive before noon or after 1:30, you will stand your best chance to be seated right away.  On the weekends, fa'git about it, you'll wait.  its worth it.   I order the exact same thing Every time I go.  I rarely change my order.  I order a Tre Tre with blue koolaid.  On a couple of occasions, I was feeling snazzy, so I ordered the Toy Toy.  The Tre  Tre is similar to the Toy Toy.  Both have 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle.  Tre Tre - Drumsticks.  Toy Toy - Wings.  The chicken is hot and crispy.  I have had it a time or two and thought that perhaps it had been cooked and sitting in a warmer too long.  The waffles are extremely good.  I enjoy putting a little of the butter and a lot of the syrup on mine and eating my waffle from the inside out!  YUMMY!   I haven't had much else on the menu, but I've sampled the plates of folks I've been with and their food was good.  I was in there a couple of weeks ago and I see that they have added several new items to the menu.  I want to try the shrimp and grits.  I was reading another Yelper's (Tigra C) review and realized, the only vegetable that I've ever tried at LoLo's is the fried green tomatoes and the fried pickles... oh and the french fries. I'm pretty sure that those 3 things do not constitute vegetables anymore.  LOL welp, I will consider the spinach the next time.  The thing about this location that I like is that the service is always friendly and prompt.  This is the only place in Phoenix for chicken and waffles.  I love being waited on by a couple of guys that work there.  they are twins.  Mr C and Mr D (if I recall correctly).  Those are some nice fellas.  I have tried their Red Velvet Cake and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was a decent contender for what I would call a good Red Velvet Cake.  It doesn't rival my 1st and 2nd favorite RVC's in phoenix.  The texture of this cake is exactly moist enough and the cream cheese icing tastes creamy and sweet.  The one thing their RVC is missing is the taste of the cake.  The hint of the chocolate is not there.  I DO NOT like the raw nuts on the cake, but I can eat around that.    All in all, LoLo's is the \"only\" spot to get  chicken and waffles in Phoenix.",

I was there at 3:00, place was half filled yet it took easily 25 minutes.  For eggs? Well hell, I know why it took 25 minutes after I saw what they plopped down in front of me (sans cheese)   \"The Chow\"-Yeah eggs were as dry as hell.

Last time I went my plates sat piled up in front of me while I was waiting to check out for over 30 minutes. The servers won't even make eye contact with you so you can get their attention.

After 3 days of resisting we decided to check it out on a Sunday morning about 9:30. We got seated right away as there were several open tables. However, after being seated the waitress took a while to get our drinks and then another bit to take our order. From this point on we sat, and we sat, and we sat waiting for our food. We looked around at the restaurant that had filled up and every other table was sitting waiting with no food on their table either.  At just near the HOUR mark, our waitress arrived with our food. I don't understand how a restaurant that only focuses on 2 items (chicken & waffles) can take an hour to complete a simple order of just those 2 items.   The food looked good when it arrived. Pretty standard fried chicken that was a tad greasy and a waffle that was quite soggy on the first bite.   I doubt we'll ever head back to LoLo's and I'd be surprised if they last until next year given the efficiency of the kitchen staff.",

Chicken is good but the service drops the ratings on this place drastically.",

    "text": "Walked out before even eating anything.  We got so much attitude from the hostess Deandrea that it really disturbed us.  She didn't say anything to us when we walked up.  She just looked at us when we walked up to her station, no smile.  Eventually I said Hi and 2 please.  She just grabbed 2 menus and walked away.  We followed her to a booth where she dropped the menus and walked away again.  Never once saying anything, no smile hardly even any eye contact.  Very disturbing and lots of attitude.   It really put us in a bad mood and we didn't feel comfortable so we left.     The valet guy outside was also very inhospitable too.  Again no smile and told us that no one likes to use him so we could just self park.  Granted it's hot out and he's probably not very happy.    On a side note, out waitress Hilary was really nice and we felt bad about just leaving before ordering.    Overall for being so close to oldtown, this restaurant did not have a Scottsdale vibe at all with sticky menus, food all over the floor and uncomfortable booths.   I get the whole \"Southern ghetto motiff\" it's going for but this was too much.",

That said, was disappointed in the bland taste of the fried chicken. It was also over cooked closer to a brown than a golden color, which comes out on the taste. That said, the waffle was on point and so were their rice and beans. And of course you can never go wrong wrong with Kool-Aid!!!! I'd definitely go back to LoLo's, but I definitely would stick to the downtown location as opposed the he Scottsdale. If you know Roscoes well, its the difference between eating Roscoes on Pico or Long Beach and eating it in Anaheim with all the hipsters.",

    "text": "I've been to Lo-Lo's couple of times now and I really don't understand the big fuss is about.  I think the food here is very average.  The chicken is ok, I personally think Popeyes Chicken is better and the waffles are plain waffles, something that you can get in any breakfast place.  The catfish was decent, but nothing to rave about.  One thing I will say is the sides are really good.  The mac and cheese and collard greens were flavorful and delicious, only drawback is, its served in a very small bowl, so you don't get much besides couple of bites.  The corn bread was good, but how could it not be, there was about a 1/4 lb of butter sitting on top of it.  One thing that did irk me was, I felt like they wanted us out of there as soon as possible.  It was a little busy and I understand they want to turn tables, but we got our check literally a minute after we got our food.  I noticed the waiter would walk by and look at the check, and hope we were ready to pay, but since we weren't even finished with our meal, I refused to give them my debit card.  I had to ask several times to get my drink refilled and the 2nd time I asked for a refill, they put it in a go to cup for me as if they were ready for me to take it to go.  It's seriously uncalled for.  I'm not a fan of this place, but fortunately for them, my girl really likes this place.  I bet if more places served Chicken and waffles, it would generate more competition, and I'm sure this place wouldnt be as busy, cause the food is really nothing special.",

We also got the catfish beignets which weren't that special, although I don't like catfish. However the service, as other have said, wasn't good at all. They asked us if we wanted our appetizer first and we said yes, then they brought it to us halfway through our main course. Our waitress didn't refill any drinks, so we actually shared one towards the end. Then they split the check wrong. In the end, if you're okay with meh service the food is honestly worth it.",

    "text": "I checked for restaurant wait times on both Yelp and NoWait. It said \"no waiting - come on in,\" for Lo-Lo's, so we decided to go there, even though I had a bad experience there in the past. I decided to give them a second chance. When we got to the counter, the girl took my name and said it would be a twenty minute wait. I showed her both apps and said that they need to update their information with the apps so that it's correct. She shrugged her shoulders and said, \"We're full.\" She said she would give us the first table to come available, which she did, so the wait wasn't long. She didn't give us menus. The waiter that came to our table never brought us a menu, although he said he was going to. I finally got up and got my own from the hostess desk. For starters, we ordered 1 decaf coffee and 1 regular coffee. The waiter explained that he'd have to brew fresh pots of each (which is weird for a Sunday at breakfast time). Ten minutes later, he brought the regular coffee, and said that the coffee maker broke so he couldn't make decaf (I find it hard to believe that you have only one coffee maker in a restaurant this size). I asked for extra cream. He never brought it. Forty five minutes went by and then I asked him if he could check on our order. He said it was busy and they had to make them in order. Meanwhile, people who came after us were already finishing their meals. It took FIFTY minutes for French toast and bacon, which we were splitting. They didn't bring an extra plate. I had to ask for it. We had asked for Bananas Foster sauce on the side. The French toast came drenched in it. The bacon was burned and tasted like it had been cooked in old oil or grease. We ate a little of it and then asked for our check. We will never go there again. First of all, if you participate with Yelp and NoWait - update your wait times so that they are accurate! Second of all, get your act together in the kitchen, hire more staff, or retrain people. And there is NO excuse for servers to be rude to someone who is asking politely for a menu, extra creamer or to check on their order that took almost an hour to make. There's no excuse for rudeness, ever!",

I was so disappointed in our experience and I wasn't the only one.  It was very busy the day we went- Oct 31st, 2014 - However, it looked as if the restaurant had not planned for that.  There were not enough staff on and the staff they had looked confused.  We sat at the bar and did not get noticed for about 20 minutes.  We had to ask for menus.  There were people around us complaining about how long it took to get their food.  The staff seemed as if they did not care.  There was only one bartender and she seemed to be in her own world.  We waited almost 45 minutes for our food.  I asked for a refill on coffee and that took another 25 minutes and I had to ask twice.  The kicker was they did not give me a new cup and she poured old coffee and when she realized it was bad she said she would get me new - however put the same old cup back.  When the new coffee came another person took my old cup and poured coffee into it...  Even the guy next to us was complaining how slow the service was.  They never apologized and as we were leaving I saw a woman complaining to the manager about her poor service and he was YELLING at her back.  This was very unprofessional. Needless to say my friends were not impressed and I won't be back...",

We got a million green beans but only four tomato slices, lot of gizzards too. I had to ask our server for plates and that's all we got, no eating utensils or napkins , I assume she thought it was finger licking good, it wasn't,  every thing was luke warm and tasteless.  I ordered two chicken thighs along with beans and rice. The wait was long too, about another 45 minutes. I've had better chicken from Churches or the larger grocery store deli chains.The beans and rice was another bad choice I've made in my life. My daughter had the same with macaroni and cheese, nothing to wow about either. The server asked us how we liked everything when we were halfway through. I lied and said it was fine. Total time from bring seated to leaving was approximately 3 hours. Service was slow. There's a old saying , \" Don't count your chickens before they hatch \", We'll, I did and I was disappointed.",

When we complained the manager scolded the waitress in front of us. Then told us he would take care of our bill and we would pay for my daughters and a beer. When received the bill it was 32.00 for a kids meal and beer. We had the most expensive childrens meal on the face of the planet. I will be calling corporate tomorrow. I tipped the server out of pitty. Will never be back!",

    "text": "Despite some reviews I read about the not so great service, I still decided to give this place a try because it was so near the hotel. I called three times to place an order to pick up and no one answered the phone. It was around 11:40 AM. So then I walked over. There is a dedicated to go ordering window. I stood there for ten minutes before someone finally acknowledged me. After ringing up my order for a salad, the waitress kept the coins in my change due without any explanation. I was going to tip her more money than that but because of her keeping the money and promptly walking away, I didn't tip.   At this point, I have been waiting 30 mins for my salad. I just asked a lady that was giving other people their to go orders about my order. (All those persons arrived after me.) She said she didn't take my order and walked away. When she came back to deliver another order, I asked her to check on my salad.   I'm now back at the hotel. It took about 35 minutes for a very basic salad with greens, 3 cherry tomatoes, 1/8 of an avocado, and chicken. I just ate most of the salad and at the bottom of the salad, there was bacon. I specifically said NO bacon.   That salad was $13 and totally not worth it! And to have such bad service on top of it makes me feel like I wasted my money.",

I like that there are different parts of the chicken you can order based on your tastes.  The price is right too.  Also make sure you order a side of Mac n Chz to go with your chicken and waffles.   The meal kept us so full we didn't even feel like eating dinner that night! :)",

It was definitely not worth it in my opinion. We got the LoLo meal which only came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles priced at $15. The chicken was either too dry or too greasy. Popeyes and Church's chicken have better chicken.  The only thing we enjoyed was the Kool-aid after years of not drinking it.  I've had way better chicken and waffles at other locations with much faster service.  Overall, this place is overrated.",

The new location is very trendy with a sports bar type of venue. As soon as you walk through the door your'e immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. I chose the bar area which is built for seating inside and out. Since the weather was nice I dined outside. The full service bar offers not only Lolo's famous fixins but some tasty adult beverages to help wash them down. Now if your a sports fan there are big screen TV's to keep you entertained that can be seen inside and outside the venue. What is nice is the full size patio is perfect for large parties. There is even a fire pit with seating around it for those cold AZ nights.   The menu has more to offer. You can still get all the same great favorites along with some new options. Yummy appetizers, mouth watering burgers, crisp salads and much more. The only issue I have with the restaurant is what should I choose. With so many delicious things to choose from I want to be greedy and order it all.  I highly recommend this restaurant for not only dining for a great meal but perfect place to take out of town guest. The location is perfect as it is right in the heart of old town scottsdale.",

Ordered the lo-lo's punch & purplesaurus rex.. they did not have the correct vodka for the lo-lo's punch so the bartender made a silimar drank. He only made the punch and completely forgot about the purplesaurus rex.. he came around maybe 15 minutes later to check on us which is when we reminded him of the other drank.  The food came out at a reasonable time after placing the order. They did not give us any silverware so we asked the food runner when he brought the food and he disappeared as though he was gonna bring some, he didn't. We had to get up and walk to the opposite side of the bar to get the bartender to hand us silverware.. not cool. Since it was rainy and a bit chilly we were a bit upset that our food would get cold.  Food was good, but not impressed by the service.  Would recommend ordering & picking up the food to-go  instead of eating in.",

    "text": "You're coming here entirely for the fried chicken and my review is 90% for the fried chicken. I think it'd be a smart idea to pretty much disregard almost everything else that isn't related. The fried chicken here is hands down the best I've had in Phoenix. Lo-Lo's has a large menu allowing you to pick what else you want to accompany your fried chicken. If you're just hankering for chicken you can also order it a la carte as well. This is what my group did:  There were 6 of us so we ordered the teaser trio with spicy corn fritters, fried gizzard, and catfish beignets. After that we all ordered some amount of fried chicken along with whatever else we wanted. Some of us got waffles, some got pancakes, some got a fried chicken salad with more fried chicken because they thought getting a salad at a fried chicken place made it okay (me). This is the realization I had, they fry things really well here. I don't know what their recipe is but it's really good. It's not terribly greasy or overly cornmeal-y, it's just done very very well.   On to the other much less important things; This place is busy and you should be ready for a wait. the 6 of us were lucky and got a table under 20 minutes but that was at 10:45 and on a weekday. I can assure you that there will be empty tables when you go in and you will wonder why you can't just sit down immediately. Just be patient.  The restaurant is very clean and has a nice sort of re-purposed modern feel to it. The menus are a little sticky because their main thing is chicken + waffles, but really fried chicken is finger food, so it's not bad.   Overall, if you like fried chicken you pretty much *have* to try Lo-Lo's.",

Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I wanted to ask for more gravy but didn't and had some left over after I was done so smothered chicken, check!  The Mac n cheese was really good but perhaps a bit too creamy.  Mac n cheese aficionados will know what I mean.  I like ever so bit of crust with top toasted and a slight bit of clumpiness... but the flavor was there.  My daughter had the shrimp and grits which were excellent if a tad bit over produced.  See the pic but the shrimp were plentiful and cooked with nice amount of spice like my family generally likes it.  The grits were creamy.  Why overproduced?  The melted cheese on top.  But I didn't look at the description or I would have asked for light cheese but my daughter ordered her own meal.    Wife had grilled cod which she enjoyed and son and no in law both had fried breast, wing and waffle.  My son finished all but a quarter of his waffle if that's any indication.  That fried chicken is rivaled only by Ms' Whites... Nobody beats Ms Whites' fried chicken.    This was Easter Sunday so I'm going to put slow service aside... we never received platters for our tasty fried green tomatoes.  Gotta add this blessing.  As we were paying our check manager brought us a $15 receipt and said family in the booth behind us wanted to help pay for our meal.  She wrote on the receipt: \"Sorry for my 2 year old's antics! God bless!\"  First we briefly noticed the 2 year old and he was doing what any 2 year old would do and caused us not one second of concern but we will surely pay it forward.  Happy Easter!  He is risen!",

    "text": "Let me start out with they get two stars because my waitress was good and I liked the music. Otherwise, this was NOT southern cooked food. Being born and raised in the south and just moving to Arizona 2 months ago I have a higher standard for southern cooking than most people who wasn't raised on it, I guess. To start the \"cheese grits\" were tasteless and all they did was throw some shredded cheese on top. I had to season and mix in the cheese with the semi warm grits to get some kind of cheese grits. If I come to a restaurant, the last thing I should have to do is season my food. And everyone that knows me, knows I hate to add salt to anything. They were not good and it was a real bummer because grits or cheese grits was a daily breakfast for me growing up. The salmon croquettes were a decent size but again lacked flavor. Then I asked for eggs over medium and not cheese eggs, but I got eggs over medium with melted shredded cheese on in. I ordered a piece of chicken, but the outside was really salty and the chicken itself had absolutely no flavor.  This was a real let down, it's like someone who has never lived in the south visited once and tried to remake everything without getting a recipe. Unfortunately this was my second time trying this chain just a different location and I won't be back.",

The hostess was with someone else when I came in, but she acknowledged me and said she'd be right with me.  I was seated with no wait.   Once I placed my order, it was on my table fresh & hot in no time at all.  I had one of the good classic meals.  2 drumsticks and a waffle.  The presentation was meh,  but the taste made up for it.  The chicken was hot and thoroughly cooked.  The waffle was great, although a little more syrup would've been nice.  I decided to have a cocktail, and the signature drink,  lo lo's punch did not disappoint.  The staff were all attentive and professional.  It's a nice local place to check out if you're in the area.",

My meal was fresh, hot and delicious and I ate like it was the coldest day in a Wisconsin winter. Normally warming the belly and filling the void that freezing temperatures leave in you. But I was not  back home, I was in Phoenix, Arizona. My belly was still warmed, but I was too full too fast for such a hot day.   I could see myself tearing up another hot meal when it cools off in PHX. In the meantime, I shall be back to check out my additional options.   P.S.

I could not believe the size of food, although I'm pretty sure I placed the order wrong and accidentally got two sides of Mac and cheese, plus an additional side of waffles. My order came out to $18... probably a bit more than your typical platter.  My favorite was probably the maple syrup! When I opened the takeout container for the waffle, I got this huge whiff of buttery, sweet, and cinnamon goodness. I didn't think maple syrup could smell this good! The sweet with the savory of the fried chicken was a perfect combo. I would say better than Roscoes in LA!  I only finished half, but the food was enough to knock me out a few hours later. So for that reason alone, I would not recommend for lunch, but great for dinner / weekends when you are free to fall into a food coma afterwards.",

I was greeted right away by Richard and he brought my drink and took my order with efficiency. I ordered the Lil Amadi, (two pieces of dark meat plus a waffle) plus a side of collard greens and an iced tea. It came to $12.95.   The chicken was over cooked but not too far. I added some of their 'award winning Hot sauce', which is Frank's, and it was fine.  The waffle was very lightly cooked (I like it that way), fluffy, with a hint of cinnamon. The greens were okay but lacked the smoke flavor that I've gotten at the other store. The drinks were huge, served in a mason jar. Kool Aid is always available.   Unfortunately, as I was finishing my meal, I noticed my plate had some hardened egg from a previous diner on it. I pointed it out to Richard, who said 'sorry', then brought my full bill.   Probably no return visit in the future.",

I waited for my order and when it arrived it was obviously wrong, as I asked the waitress Amanda who was polite through the process to please bring me a new sandwich with the right cheese she apologized and took it back to the kitchen, I waited another 10 min. As it got back to the table I checked the sandwich and the kitchen staff didn't even dare to removed any of the remaining cheese, they literally just placed a new slice of pepper jack on top of the American cheese. So I asked someone to speak to the manager, as I'm waiting for Kate the manager on duty I told her the situation and without even apologizing she just asked if I wanted a new one. All I wanted was for them to make my sandwich the way I asked for it, she treated me like I was complaining because I wanted free food. I will never come back to this location.",

Parking was everywhere, so I parked right up front.  The hostess seated us promptly, and our waiter took our drink orders...two iced teas.  On the flight over we were talking about chicken gizzards which got me hungry for them.  I didn't see a appetizer order of gizzards on the menu, but I asked the server and in no time at all, the gizzards arrived.  They were very tender and had a good flavor.  Five Stars for the Gizzards.  We had to decided if we were going to go out rib eye hunting in the evening yet, so I ordered the small order of chicken and waffles.  My friend ordered chicken and gravy and waffles.   By the time we finished off the gizzards our meal came.   Mine looked and tasted delicious.   The waffles were so light and fluffy and would love to come back just for them.  Chicken was good too.  Five stars for that!  My friend said he hadn't had chicken and gravy since he lived in the south, and it said it was just as good, or even better.  The whole time service was EXCELLENT!  Five stars for that.  Would definitely come again.",

I got the three-piece chicken with Mac and cheese, collards, and cornbread. The portions were huge and I ended up with tons of leftovers (didn't even get to the cornbread), but I wish I would've gotten the smothered chicken (my mom got the chicken fried chicken with the brown gravy, which I tried and was blown away by.)

I decided to give this place another chance and was NOT disappointed.   My bartender was friendly, attentive and her suggested food recommendation was on-spot: the chicken tenders with a waffle. It was delicious and VERY filling.   Will come back again when I am in the area again.",

That is what was good with my experience here.  I asked for all thigh meat.  It looked like a thigh but it was so dry I could barely swallow.  Seriously I've had waaaaaay better fried chicken from a grocery store.  And KFC blows Lo-Los away in the seasoning dept.  I' not sure there was any on the chicken it was that bland.  My mashed potatoes were too garlicy.  Wasn't expecting that much garlic in potatoes from this type of place.  Just wanted normal potatoes.  Corn was OK.  Cornbread was good.  But for a place that chicken is it's main menu item Lo-Los needs to step it up.  A Lot.",

We had been in the restaurant no more than 5 minutes when the manager came to our table and told us that their health license doesn't allow them to have any outside containers of any kind in the building. We were told we needed to take our expensive water bottles to the car or we could leave them at the host stand.  If we weren't able to do that, we needed to leave.     This same manager also walked up to a table and told a family with babies that they couldn't have containers- their containers being baby bottles used to feed their children.    They claim the city health inspector says that nothing- not even medical food or children's bottles or food is allowed.  The manager told us to call and complain about it to the health inspector because their lawyers can't even figure it out.  The manager did end up coming back to apologize and did comp our iced tea. But it was just so completely ridiculous. I think I'll pass and go to any other location.... if I ever go back to Lo-Lo's at all. This was really just the last straw. I've never experienced this at any other scottsdale restaurant.",

There is a DJ that is actually quite good, and the music just puts you in a lively mood, be it at the bar or table. 3. The employess are in a good mood due to the atmosphere, and it just rubs off on you (the positive vibes & all).  This is more than just a chicken & waffle venue.

Got sat right down and had a waitress come up who told me her name and her nickname. After looking over the menu, placed my order and got ready for some good chow. First the waitress brought me sweet tea when I asked for unsweetened, easily fixed. Along comes another server with my food with an explanation on how my biscuits would be coming right out. Something about the baker I couldn't understand but figured they're be served soon. After about a 1/3 eaten, asked a manager type for my biscuits, \"yes sir, I will get those right up for you\" never saw him again. After eating about half, here was my waitress asking how it was. I asked for the biscuits yet again and she ran off to (I thought) get them. The next time I saw the waitress I said if no biscuits bring me toast. After 5 more minutes she brought me the biscuits and to use her words, \"right out the oven\". The biscuits were stone cold and the ball of butter that was on top wasn't melting, it was hardening from the cold biscuits. And of course, no one stopped to ask how it was until the waitress brought the check. I questioned her on the biscuits and she mumbled something. How good was the chicken and waffles? Who knows, it was all ruined by the biscuit fiasco. My best tip - order something that does not include biscuits and hopefully you won't be as disappointed as I was.",

The chicken was cooked perfect with a crunchy skin and more flavor then I had imagined. The Bacon Bloody Mary was \"a party in my mouth\"! And of course it was too much food to finish, so in my classiest act I brought it home to enjoy again later! The whole staff was friendly and I was so intrigued with the uniform t-shirts!

We finally just asked for Bloody Marys and he started making them then stopped half way through to clean up around the bar and start doin other things around the bar.  The woman sitting next to us asked for hot sauce and ended up having to ask us to hand her the hot sauce next to us since she was ignored by the staff.

Some of my personal fav's Mac n Cheese, Candy Sweets, cornbread, biscuits n gravy, collard greens etc!  They even have some great Kool-Aid options with classic southern sweet tea.   You will get Healthy portions along w flavorful fried chicken that is the best I've ever eaten (except for some homemade chix in Greenville SC)lol.

Food was BOMB, music was BOMB, everything here is 5 stars. I will definitely be back. This food is a MUST HAVE when visiting Arizona. I can't wait to come back!!

Also I think they've tried to create more of a trendy club-like atmosphere instead of a homey place. I really don't like that they have a DJ. It's often too loud to have a decent conversation. The food is still great. Their chicken and waffles are unrivaled and their fried catfish is a treat. I also recommend the cornbread. It is massive and easily shared.",

I've gone with friends who got their food, ate their food, and eventually paid for their meal while mine was still cooking. I've ordered food to go to avoid the customer service. They told me it would take 20 minutes. I ended up waiting an hour and my order was still wrong and because I paid over the phone, they said they couldn't issue a refund. I told the hostess to have the manager call me since they weren't available. No one called and I never got my money or correct food. It's to the point to not only will I ever give my money to Lo-Lo's again, I want to warn everyone else who plans to give them money as well.   If all you care about is the quality of food and not necessarily the accuracy of it matching up to what you actually ordered OR if you don't care about being treated like crap, then enjoy !",

The chicken meat was dry lacking any moisture and the outside lost most of the crunch, likewise the sad waffle which in happier days had been crisp and tasty was now merely doughy . Their two signature items have totally lost their crunch and flavor . What a Shame !   The servers friendly , but the starter of fried green tomatoes was ordered immediately when we sat down and took 45 minutes to arrive , and before  we could take our first bite the dinner was on the table . Bad! We clearly wanted a starter !   Opening too many locations has caused Lolo 's to lose their crunch . Don't bother going ..  at least this location the food has gone soggy .",

I can park my own car, plus it created a long line of cars waiting to have their cars valeted. We walk inside and the hostess tells us it'll be a 15 min wait, but it was only 5 min. We got seated and there were still crumbs on the seat. OKAY. We both ordered the soul food platter cuz it's more bang for your buck! Otherwise I would've paid $8 for mac&cheese and a waffle. Carl was a great waiter and let me order one salmon croquette and one piece of cod. With it, I got cornbread and my two sides. Great deal and yum food. I like that they offer breakfast all day so maybe I'll try their pancakes next time.   Just get rid of the valet parking. Thanks!",

We have heard that the food is awesome so we were very excited to try this place. We walked in to only a few tables being used and no one at the hostess stand (around 2pm) that's fine. We sat down and waited to be greeted and seated. About 15 minutes later a lady comes by and asks \"how many?\" We responded with \"HELLO, it's two and a baby.\" She then grabs two menus and walks away. My husband then asks \"we follow you right?\" In which she nods her head yes(no smile no nothing). So we sit down. We understand sometimes being busy some restaurants won't have the best customer service but this place was not busy at all. Then we remind her we need a high chair. She then appears bothered and yells at a man to bring the high chair. The guy really puts the cherry on top of any already bad experience (heavy set Hispanic male with some tattoos). He comes over and slams the high chair, my husband thanks him anyways and his attitude towards our \"thank you\" was really nasty.  At this point we really wanted to try the food here however the not so good service from not just one person but two had us go else where for our lunch, which is really disappointing.",

Not to mention the service I had. She was rude, she asked my opinion about the steak and I told her the exact words and all she had to say was \"okay......\" And left the table.

Lo-Lo's is definitely one of those places where you eat and worry about the consequences from the calories later.

    "text": "***Remember to Valet Park or park alongside Lo-Lo's and do not park in the parking area in front of the restaurant because the parking area is for Holiday Inn Express guests only! Or else, you'll get your car towed, and have to pay $125 to rescue it from impound. Okay?! ***  Anywho, I was craving fried chicken, and asked my friend S, if she wanted to lunch with me, we got to Lo-Lo's at around 12:45pm today Sunday 11/23, and were seated within a few minutes. Going back to the parking thing, I kinda chuckled thinking I nabbed the lone open spot in the lot, saw the complimentary valet by the door but the valet guy wasn't paying attention and wasn't told that was not their parking. There are signs mind you on the edge of the lot but nothing says the lot directly in front of the resto is not their parking. I regress, let's get back to the food review. It has been awhile since I've been, and it was S first time, so, we got seated at the common table by the bar area. It's nice to see how successful Lo-Lo's has become, to think they started out in a converted house in Central Phoenix, expanded out to Scottsdale, and open a new location in a free standing restaurant with so much space, a spacious open bar area with a roomy patio area, the overall feel is nice, it's airy, and neat. I like the kitschy bar chairs, and the different booths, and their staff uniforms are visually appealing. I'm also impressed with how large their menu offerings have become, and as S said it, who knew Kool Aid could look so classy served in a Mason Jar! S got the namesake dish, and I got KK's because I was going all out with the cheese and onion egg and the grits. The fried chicken was on point, neither too crispy and still retained moistness and had great flavor. Our server checked on us, and topped off our drinks. Service-wise it was great and our lunch was great. I think the afterwards left a dent in our overall experience of the new location.   Walking out not seeing your car where you parked it is an unnerving experience in itself because from being in high spirits one moment to thinking your car was stolen the next just takes from my feelings towards Lo-Lo's. Hearing from the valet that my car was towed caught me by surprise, he was not emphatic at all but nonchalantly said it, and he sounded annoyed that I was taken aback, he proceeded to tell me, I could look up the signs for the number (of the tow company), or I could talk to the hotel manager about it since he was the one who towed all the cars (when we parked there had to be at least 10 other cars). As we were walking towards the hotel across the way, there were still people parking unawares, and the valet wasn't saying anything but this time there were others who were telling them to move their car. Long story short, hotel manager told us that they will try to mark the lot to show it's the hotel's. and Lo-Lo's actually has 15 parking spots they can use (which I guess is the valet's), so kudos they have a larger restaurant but fail on their end for having less parking than they used to when they were in the strip mall down the street. Oh, and if you enter through the back way from drinkwater blvd, there's lack of signage telling you which is Lo-Lo's parking but from the front from Earll Street there are signs. I don't know who's fault it is but for a good dining experience avoid this nuisance and headache and just valet with Lo-Lo's it's cheaper than having to pay $100+ more. I might just dine at the original location in Central Phoenix to avoid this again, what was gonna be a four-star review was marred by the parking debacle. Great place for chicken and not to park!",

    "text": "Came here with my family who were all very excited about the concept of chicken & waffles. We were seated quickly as we opted to sit outside rather than wait for a table inside, but the moment we got to our table it was like everyone forgot about us. The service was painfully slow, took 20 minutes to get our drinks & food took longer than average to come out. I ordered a side of fried okra & had to send it back twice because it was lukewarm & had obviously been previously frozen. Food was ok, my Omlett was good & the waffles were the best thing there. I don't eat chicken but my family all had chicken & waffles and all walked away wondering what all the hype was about.",

The waffle was OK, the chicken breasts were bland and dry.  The sweet tea was fruity not sweet. The chili tasted as though it came out of a can and then had hot sauce liberally applied.  The food was hot though. The service was quick and so was the check.  The check had items on it that we did not order.  I thought the prices were really high.  $37 for two at lunch without cocktails.  After the reviews, I had to try it but will not be back.",

    "text": "Downhill.  Two years ago I went to old location, took my Mom there for mother's day.  It was a good place, quiet, easy parking, good food.  Non-chain, family run.  OK two years later we go again.  Valet parking (? the lot is mostly empty, why can't I park), OK just part across the street and walk.   The problem is they've changed the atmosphere to the trendy, way-loud fashion.     The interior is all hard surfaces so the conversation is pretty loud, then for some reason they play music.  People talk louder to be heard over music, so they turn up the music, which makes people talk louder.   There is iPhone app to measure sound level- it was consistent 90db.     To the owners: if we want trendy hip loud restaurant we can go to five-guys.   I won't patronize this place again, you've ruined your atmosphere.    I might try a different location if it not as loud.",

Just this past Sunday, 10/19/2014, we arrived in time for the doors to open at 7am.  The music was loud.  Yes, on a Sunday morning at 7am, it was loud enough for us to ask the server or hostess if the music could be turned down and the answer was no.   The food was as delicious as always and the service was pretty good, but we had a hard time hearing him, over the music.   Honestly, if it's that loud at that time of morning, how can we invite friends to go there?  We couldn't have a conversation.   It just doesn't make sense.   I don't want to give it a lower rating because I only have the one complaint... as major as it is, we won't go back til we know we can have a decent conversation.",

I've enjoyed the few times I've made it to the old location.  Now on to the new one.  First, the new chairs are very uncomfortable to sit in.  When we were seated, they tried to put us in the bar area first.  We were there early afternoon, and the rest of the place was not crowded.  The music in the entire place is way too loud for a restaurant, and worse in the bar area.  So I asked to be moved.  I don't like having to shout at the people I've having a meal with.  Our wait for the food was not too long.  But getting someone's attention for anything was a bit hard.  Turn the music down and tell your people they are not there to talk to each other.  Also, when I mentioned the loud music I got an attitude from the server.  I think if I need Lo-Lo's chicken again, I'll get it to go.",

Food: I absolutely love their waffles and mac -- I have never been disappointed by these two. As for their fried chicken... hit or miss. I have eaten the juiciest, crispest pieces of meat at this restaurant and other times, the chicken has been less than par. My advice is to go for lunch. You will definitely have a better shot of eating the best fried chicken in AZ.   Atmosphere: the interior is really well done. The decorations, tables, menus tie together to bring the southern food together. However, the location is difficult to find and I personally think the upgrades to the Scottsdale location made the restaurant more commercialized.   Service: everyone is really nice....but they have terrible execution. I'll just say, Our appetizers came out after we had finished our meal.... so don't expect top notch service or maybe don't order appetizers. Your call.",

I can guarantee you nothing here is homemade. I do not recommend this restaurant. If southern fare is what you are craving, even Cracker Barrel is better than this place.

I actually hadn't been to this Lo-Lo's location yet, and it worked out perfectly!  We headed over with his grandparents and our two kids in tow, and we were seated within about five minutes at a lovely table outside on the patio.  Service was attentive and friendly and the large portions of food were delicious!    I was happy to see a few healthy options on the menu, and I went for an egg white omelette, but balanced it out with french fries, grits, and waffle.  Everyone at our table was pleased with their orders - kids included!  I'd absolutely return to Lo-Lo's on a special occasion or just a regular one.  I need to go for the chicken next time!

The waffles were ok though. The biscuits and gravy was alright but lacked anything amazing. The house cocktail (forgot the name) also was just really sweet. Also you'll get a heart attack eating most of this food. Seemed more like a chain restaurant than a local place. I don't plan on coming back.",

    "text": "Friends and I tried out the Scottsdale location tonight. I was a first timer. Table for 8. Used the restroom as soon as I arrived, filthy. Sat down,  menus and table were sticky with syrup. Went to order and waiter clearly didn't know the menu. Ordered a glass of wine.  Menu had no prices or selection, four whites four reds.  That's fine! You don't go to Lolo's for the wine. I get it! So I assumed it would be a decently priced house wine. It was $12! If you dine in Phoenix or Scottsdale at all,  you know on average you can get a glass for $9. Ridiculous.  I was robbed. Meal was less than mediocre. Server was sweet but clearly stretched too thin.  Never once got a refill on water.  Cleared our dishes just before we left, probably 15 minutes after we finished eating. One of our guests got his meal 10 minutes after the rest of us,  the other got her fries after she was done with her meal.  Spent over $30 on this meal.  Not pleased.",

Wonderful customer service skills and just so friendly!! As a manager at a restaurant it was nice to have the manager stop by and interact with us and other guests! The food was incredible(even though I ordered WAY too much)! We will definitely be back! If you're ever in, hopefully you get Mike as a server!",

All of the spots in front of the restaurant are reseved for the hotel next door. So your parking options are valet or park on the other side of the hotel and walk. We wete here on a Sunday morning so they were busy but we still got our meals in a timely manner. I would definitely try this place if you are ever in the area.",

The chicken was cooked great, big size pieces n only suggestion was they should have been seasoned a little better. The waffles are kind of thin but tasted good, the syrup they served was hot. The sweet tea is extremely sweet i hate to say it because i love sugar but it was really sweet. The wait staff and bartender were awesome.  Overall fun place,  and great ambiance.",

But I might actually prefer the sides: Mac n cheese, collard greens, the list goes on!",

It seems like most places have gone to requiring valet parking and it seems silly and unnecessary and adds another $5 to the deal.",

It appeared our order was skipped or somehow forgotten as tables around us that were seated after us received their food.  Our waitress disappeared and we happened to catch someone who we believe was the manager serving another table.  We asked what was going on with our food and said he was going to check but never came back.  Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received our food.  We asked to speak with the manager several times just to talk about our experience but he never came out.  I believe they said he name was Josh or Jim or something like that and he was supposedly in the kitchen helping to get food out.  in the end, he comped our meals but that wasn't what we wanted.  We really wanted some type of explanation of what was going on and you know...a little customer service.    The only shining light in terms of customer service was another young man who helped to bring out our food, grabbed utensils for us to eat with while our waitress was still MIA, and kept checking back with us.  He even had the courtesy to apologize for the manager not bothering to come out.  He should be running the place because Josh or whatever his name is clearly doesn't know what he's doing.",

We walk in there tonight and we had to wait at least five minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there. Then this lady with dark hair walks up, looking like she'd rather be anywhere but working. She said two? Then immediately followed with dogs are not allowed. I replied with he is not a dog he is a service animal. She said it doesn't matter you have to sit outside. I said oh well you must not be up to date on your laws, I'll just talk to your manager. Then she proceeds to say I am the manager. I was shocked she even said that bc of how she was acting, her body language and the way she approached the situation. It must've been her very first ever in the customer service industry. But whatever I went on to say ok well a service animal is allowed anywhere humans are allowed. She said I don't care you still have to sit outside. Then I proceeded to say ok well this is a lawsuit waiting to happen bc I could sue you for refusing me service indoors bc I need a service animal. She then snickers, chuckles and had an attitude and grabbed the menus. I then said you know what I'm not going to waste my money here. She said ok and we left. If I was the owner of LoLo's I would not only embarrassed that someone so unprofessional, rude, and unwelcoming was the first person my paying customers see and interact with, but also that she is running your store in the manner that she is running it. I've never been treated so poorly or rudely in my entire life. she has to be the worst manager I've ever come across. I wouldn't be surprised if this has happened before where she does not care about the customers or making regulars. Let alone I've never been in an establishment where I am not even welcomed or acknowledged and so quickly pushed out the door. The way I look at it was that she was thinking less work for me oh well. Very very unpleasant all around. Needs to teach employees the laws and fire the horrible manager and start fresh.",
