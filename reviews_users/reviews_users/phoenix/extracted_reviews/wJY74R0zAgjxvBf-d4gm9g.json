    "text": "Well, not sure if my single visit here on a not-so-busy Sunday night (the day before NYE to be exact) is necessarily a \"typical\" experience this place can be judged by, but I like what I saw (and drank).  Even with the location, I'm actually kind of shocked from reading the reviews this place is actually as crowded as it sounds like on a Saturday night. Even though there's a large bar, pool tables, and couches, I got more a restaurant vibe so I figured it would attract a more casual, early crowd. Although, I will say the \"Irish pub\" theme here is a little more \"upscale\" and less \"hole-in-the-wall.\"  Like I said, I was here on a Sunday, when Kelly's has all day happy hour (another reason my experience here was pretty positive). HH at Kelly's is $4 off there fancier normally $10-$12 cocktails & $2 off there normally $6 beers. $4 Kilt Lifters? I can dig it (and I did!).  Maybe if I came here for dinner or on a late Saturday night I might have felt differently about this place, but my experience at Kelly's was pretty positive and I'd come back...especially during HH (which I believe is 3-7 Mon-Sat, and all day Sunday).",

The price was decent. Not the worst dining experience, but it didn't inspire any plans to return.",

It's pretty chill still around 9 or 10p ish but then gets pretty packed around 11 onward.  The servers are so COOL and nice. I always try to tip pretty generously w/them.  Try to ceviche here also - it's tasty. Have a friend who puffs cancer sticks? Send them on their merry way out to the patio w/the other puffers.",

It was always such an enjoyable experience.  Not so much this time.  The food was less than average and extremely disappointing.  Not sure if they changed chefs or what.  My wife had the braised short ribs and if I remember right it used to be served on polenta it is now served on mashed potatoes with an egg on the top?  My wife also said the short ribs were stringy and a bit tough, not tender at all.  My filet mignon was also served on some of the lumpiest garlic mashed potatoes I've ever eaten.  The filet had a different odd taste to it and not so good.  The rock shrimp cevichi which is our favorite was not very fresh this time.  Last but not least our waitress took a long time to get to us.  Our Cevichi arrived way before our drinks.  I was almost tempted to not wait for the waitress and get up and order a drink while we waited for our other drink. All in all not an experience that would bring me back in the door again.  The jury is still out on whether this is still one of our go to places.  I will have to give them credit though  they did pay for our drink.",

The bartenders were pleasant and gave good suggestions too; they really seemed to know the menu.  The food was pretty good and way above average compared to typical bar fare.  I had the Gas Lamp Chicken Sandwich and loved the grilled zucchini that came on it!  The fries were gobbled up by my friends.  It did however take forever to get my food and it was not that busy, but I think I need to come back again and maybe things will go a bit smoother.

We had been planning this event for weeks and, what with the company owners flying in with their guests, you just hope everything will go well. It was a smash.   Decor for the holidays was great. Not over stated, classic and welcoming. They were very accommodating about the music program, sitting with me before the party to develop a music mix of some of their regular program and a touch of current and jazz holiday favs. We even designed a company themed martini.   The kitchen went all out with pass around appetizers and the service staff was wonderful. Then came the main courses they are famous for and even a seafood gumbo we asked to be added. The buffet was constantly refilled and all the guests were really impressed. The food was always fresh and delicious.   Then to top off the evening, Coffee, Tea, and Cocoa with a delicious desert bar.   There were thank you's all around that evening and I understand the owners stayed till closing - I guessed they had a great time.  You really can't go wrong with these folks. They are pros and the venue is large but intimate. Check it out for yourself.",

They have a solid piece of real estate, and a nice little setup, but apart from that this place blows.  Drinks? Overpriced Service? Slow Food? Shitty Crowds? YES  Why the fuck do people come here?  Kelly's is packed with a bunch of people who don't really know or like each other, people who aren't really good friends.  Friends have stuff in common, so they can agree on a certain bar. No one wants to go to Kelly's, it's just the only place left to go when you and a group of 8 idiots can't agree on a place.  Don't believe me? Read all the reviews on here and see how many of them say: \"Me and 26 of my *closest* friends decided to meet here\" or something to that effect.  Newsflash: You shouldn't be in a fucking group that big, that's why this place is packed.  Girls night groups of 10 wander around waiting to get molested while even more single dudes pretending to be respectable huddle around with their dicks in their hands.  Go here on a Sunday afternoon. I've done it, and it was decent. You'll have the place to yourself and everything I've said above won't really apply, except for this shit prices of course.  However, if it's a weekend (let's face it: it is) you'll get more bang for your buck standing in line at a port-a-potty than standing in a line to get into this joke.",

I have a little pet peeve with the Scottsdale arena and sometimes I feel myself disliking the patron as some establishments due to the fact that Scottsdale can often be less than inviting and quite stuck up, not at this place. I really enjoyed the people here.   - I have lots of reasons to go back here, but one thing in particular must be to try their version of the already awesome Moscow Mule. I am not sure what's added or changed, but the house version is stated to be awesome and I will find this out for myself.   A negative is that they only have one little bathroom. That's unbelievable. And if the case would be that there are more bathrooms, then the negative is that I couldn't find them. An important thing when creating a comfortable drinking establishment, must be to make the act of relieving yourself and quick and easy ordeal - otherwise lots of valuable drinking time gets wasted in the pursue and wait of previously said relief.   - I will come back, and I will evaluate this establishment more thoroughly.",

We all left and went to a bar down the street in the main entertainment district where we were served almost immediately after walking in.   Really disappointed with the service we experienced, especially because my friends and I really love the general environment and vibe that Kelly's offers.

My sister is a bartender at a busy establishment in downtown Phoenix and she can handle the whole entire bar on a busy packed night, solo! And it wasn't even that busy. Pay attention to your customers Kelly's bartenders and tone down the cocky attitudes . The resting bitch face look suits your staff well.",

    "text": "Kelly's at SouthBridge is my favorite happy hour spot in Old Town Scottsdale! With so many great appetizers all half-priced from 3-7p, you can't go wrong.   I'm a bit overdue in writing this review, but I still have fond memories of the fun evenings and happy hours spent here and couldn't keep this to myself any longer.   One of the great things about Kelly's is that they have happy hour EVERYDAY! Monday to Saturday from 3-7pm and ALL DAY Sunday you can enjoy 50% off appetizers, $4 drafts/wine/well drinks, and $4 off signature cocktails.   The appetizers at Kelly's are delicious and the happy hour menu offers a number of great drink options!   Our favorite appetizers are the Haloumi Stuffed Cherry Peppers ($4, HH) and Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($5, HH). These are so good we ordered them every time we came! Definitely recommend trying these two dishes, especially at the happy hour price you can't go wrong!   For heartier appetites, I recommend the Short Rib Tacos - very tasty and great value at $6 during HH! And of course, Kelly's Original Four-Cut Burger ($14) is not to be missed for dinner. My friend raves about the perfect combination of short-rib, sirloin, chuck, and brisket, served with onion relish and Comte cheese. Try it and see what you've been missing!    The bartenders have a heavy hand - good news! Except if you like a sweeter drink (like me) take note! My Old Fashioned ($8, HH) was so strong I had to \"water it down\" with club soda. I'm such a wuss. I don't know why I'm complaining, but unless you can handle straight whiskey, I'd suggest skipping this drink and trying one of the other creative cocktails options!",

Went a couple weeks ago and had the worst 2 female bartenders (front bar as soon as you walk in) in history. Horrible attitude. Horrible service. Horrible everything. I used to love this place and now it is absolute garbage. Best part is I tried to even let the manager know on my way out and he said \"I know you are the 10th person this weekend to complain about the service\" lmao. I also emailed the same manager and never even got a reply about the service or the evening. I have been in the service industry my whole life.....please I hope this keeps people away from this place. Old Town has so many AMAZING spots. Please go elsewhere if you are planning an evening out. The only reason I gave this place one star is I don't think you can leave 0....plus the music was decent :) If you want terrible service with an even WORSE attitude please stop by the front bar and grab a drink! If not please go anywhere else and enjoy your night!",

Let's start with us getting to the door and they say no tables open to accommodate us, as we are walking away I notice numerous tables. We walk back and tell her about the tables and her reply \"oh \" and takes us in.  Inside our waitress has severe memory loss as she forgets our food and blames it on the chef. Forgets drinks and we have to ask numerous times .   The food is just shy of average. Nothing special. Nice cold potatoes. Meatballs that tasted like they come from Costco.   Here is the best part about this dumpster. A older gentleman approaches our table to talk with some of the girls. He buys the bachlorette a drink and proceeds to chat with us. All of us girls cash out our tabs. The waitress tell us she can't find this gentleman and that we have to pay his tab. What!! She stated since he was by us we are responsible. What kind of business is this? Teach the waitress to take a credit card from the drunk mess old man before trusting him. This place is a joke. We actually had to pay the tab for this douche bag because the place wouldn't lets us go without paying or they said they would call the police.",

I just wish I could remember her name, tall and with her brunette hair up in a bun, she was prompt and professional and kind. We asked if we could have a light turned out and unfortunately they could not do it for us but she did ask and came back with a cogent explanation. I also returned a glass of wine, first time I have ever done that! I think it was a type that was not frequently ordered and was beyond its expiration date so to speak ...she brought me something different and it was much better.

    "text": "I am originally from Scottsdale, but I live In NYC now.  I am in town and my parents took me to Kelly's last night.  I don't typically write reviews whether the restaurant is good or bad, but this place was so awful, I thought I owed it to society to warn you about this place.    Right when we showed up  the hostess looked like she had just gotten in a fight with her boyfriend and had a disgusted scowl on her face...she said we could sit anywhere.  Patio is nice so I was able to ignore the rude entrance.  We chose a table on the patio and it literally took 7 minutes for someone to even acknowledge our existence and finally bring us water.  Just as they did that, we realized the table cloth was absolutely filthy.  So we decided to just move to another table...once we sat down there, we realized that table was not sturdy at all and had to move to a 3rd table.  While this was going on, I mentioned to the waiter that we had to move bec the table cloth was filthy...2 minutes later I saw another waiter come and I was happy to see they were addressing the dirty cloth. However, I soon realized, instead of putting a clean cloth on, they just turned it inside out.  Same thing you would do with a stained couch cushion.  Moving along, we are now at our 3rd table and I could feel there was something strange under the cloth. I lifted the cloth up and the table looked to be at least 30 years old and was fully rotting away.  I still cannot understand how that table was not thrown out years ago, but I guess they figured a dirty table cloth would at least keep the customers from getting any splinters.  At this point I just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there.  I ordered a cheeseburger medium rare and I think to them that means to sear the meat for 5 seconds. It is pretty hard to screw up a cheeseburger, but they succeeded in this also.  It was awful and I didn't even eat 1/2 of it.  With all of this going on, the entire staff looked miserable and were extremely unfriendly.  I'm not sure if it was just a bad night for every single employee, but I work hard at my job and a smile is not too much to ask for.  I could probably type a lot more about my hour long experience at Kelly's, but hopefully this helps you avoid this place.  You could not pay me to go back and it definitely falls within my top 5 all time worst dining experiences.",

Great house cocktails (AZ Mule is a must try) and generally a good mix between \"beautiful people\" and average folks. In fact, I would say the crowd is diverse by Scottsdale standards. I mostly come here at night but the food is pretty good too. One thing to note (and I say this only because I've seen many a person fall for this) there is one bathroom that is in plain sight and it's a onesie but that's not the only bathroom walk passed the bar and hang a left. I know, what a silly and unsexy thing to write about in a review of a sexy little bar but I know every woman reading this can attest that knowing the bathroom situation is important. :-)",

    "text": "Kelly's is a fresh addition to Old Town and feels like a bar out of San Francisco or Chicago. Those who visit Kelly's seem to be professionals in the mid-late 20's and 30's so it's not a bar where you'll see lots of people in college. The interior is warm with dark wooden panels and dim lightening. They have a good amount of indoor seating, they have a private room in the back, but the most seating lies on their spacious patio. Their patio is one of the best decks around and offers a great area to sit and enjoy some food and drinks when the weather's nice. I also really enjoyed their drinks which are made fresh with very fresh ingredients. During my recent visit, I ordered a chicken sandwich and french fries. The food is several steps above your typical bar food and offers a nice flavor. All in all, I am a big fan of Kelly's and I think this is a perfect lounge to frequent. However, I personally liked it the most in the early evening. It was one in one out by 10 PM!",

No one answered the phone and there wasn't any indication on social media that they would be closed. Guys, what happened? Thank goodness we have more happy hours in town. If Kelly's management can't be open during posted hours or explain why they were closed, I simply cannot be a patron anymore.",

We went with a group of 6. They seated us in a huge booth that was very spacious and comfortable also very promptly. We were then greeted  by our server that was amazing! She was friendly and has actually tried everything on the menu which is very rare to find now a days. The fish & chips and black and blue hamburger are great. Some of our table guest tried the steak sandwich and weren't the biggest fans. We also has some truffle fries that were really good. The drinks are a tad pricey but are you in a trendy  restaurant in old town Scottsdale so you get what you pay for. We had a birthday in our group and they don't sing HBD it's not that type of place but they do bring a deep fried doughnut balls and candles and they brought enough for everyone in the group which was really sweet! I saw looking at the menu they have a great happy hour on Sunday so I'm going to try them out again and update on that and actually take some photos! At night, I don't think it's kid friendly but wheelchair ok, great for big groups or celebrating and you'll spend about $20-35 for dinner and drink but portions or huge and good quality food. Enjoy!",

When we had our appetizers delivered to our table, we had to wait roughly 15 minutes to receive plates and drink refills. When it came to our entrees they were mismatched and incorrect. We were also charged for their mistakes. E.g. Side of fries ordered, delivered salad. They charged us for the salad then said they would bring the fries at no charge. So we thought! They ended up charging us for both the salad and the side of fries and the side of fries were to be included for free with the entree. We were also charged for an additional dessert that we never ordered. We had asked to order some coffee after dinner and were told that they ran out of coffee around 11am this morning. Really!?! I would strongly advise against dining at Kelly's. It appears that it is more of an establishment for drinking than dining.",

    "text": "I went to Kelly's early on a recent Saturday night with a group of four friends, as it had been recommended to us.  We wanted to have some drinks, try the food, and have a casual dinner before the weekend crowds hit.  This space is nicely decorated and comfortable, but I have to give the lowest review possible based on the restaurant's misguided policies.  One person in our group happened to order a Moscow Mule when our server was taking drink orders.  She said \"OK I'm just going to have to take your ID\".  We were so confused we all just kind of looked at each other, and my friend handed over his ID (was he being carded?  We were all in our 30s and 40s at the table).    It turns out, Kelly's assumes its customers are going to steal from them.  Our server informed us (when we asked why she needed to hold one person's driver's license) that the copper mugs they use in the Moscow Mules are \"very expensive\" and \"people steal them\".  I sort of waited for her to laugh, as I assumed she was joking... apparently she was dead serious.  If you assume that I'm going to steal from your establishment before I even walk in the door, you can be assured I'm not going to spend my money with you.    Kelly's was busy and full this Saturday night, and I'm sure they'll be successful without my business.  The five of us paid our drink bill, and walked across the street to Barrio Queen for a great dinner, where none of us were asked for collateral when we ordered.",

There were 4 bartenders and I counted at least 15 other people standing around the square bar waiting patiently for drinks just like I was. I literally stood there for over 9 minutes (yes I timed it) and no one was being helped. No one. The 4 bartenders were washing glasses and looking at tickets and talking to each other. Every single one of them were avoiding eye contact with everyone as if to say \"we'll get to you when we feel like getting to you\". They were just taking their sweet time as if no one was there. I looked around the bar and made eye contact with a few others waiting too and they gave me the same \"wtf\" look too. I just put my 20 away and walked out. What a joke of a place.",

Tangy, sweet cherry peppers encase a nugget of salty, slightly chewy cheese topped off with a zippy sweet balsamic glaze. Flavors and textures meld beautifully and I'm a believer!   The calamari was terrific too. Not breaded but instead tempura battered with a light crispy crunch. The squid was tender and not not chewy and the spicy aioli was a perfect dip!   The gas lamp chicken sandwich was also a masterpiece combining those same tangy cherry peppers in a crunchy slaw that gave this sandwich a little something special. The crusty roll was grilled and the chicken was moist, tender and juicy. I will definitely order this again! Get it with the mixed green salad, chock full of strawberries, hazelnuts and lucious goat cheese and finished with a delectable honey balsamic vinaigrette. Thank me later.  And don't miss the donut holes as a sweet finish to a Devine meal. Piping hot, fluffy dough balls covered in cinnamon sugar and drizzled with honey. Shut the front door! These were positively sinful and the cup of hand whipped vanilla whipped cream should be on the menu as a dessert all it's own!   The service was fantastic from the bubbly hostess to the attentive, friendly server. Our sodas and waters were kept full to the top and plates cleared promptly and our food brought piping hot and quickly!   And the place is gorgeous inside! Masculine elegance softened up with fresh colorful tulips in mason jars on every table. The joint emitted warmth and friendliness, so unlike many other Scottsdale gastro-pubs!   This was a lunch excursion with my bestie and our babies and we felt comfortable and welcome. I can't wait to bring my husband for a perfect date!  Stop reading this and head over to Kelly's at Southbridge. Now.",

Everyone that walked into this bar was in casual dress. They have a pool table and ample seating. Got there around 4:30pm and had an entire 2 couches to ourselves (just the 2 of us). The mac'n cheese was very tasty, with a special addition on top (spicy hot cheetos!).

The trilogy of bruschetta was really strange. It was 3 pieces of toast, one had cream cheese and jelly on it? The roasted chicken sandwich tasted like fruit loops. The only thing that was remotely edible was the simple salad. On the flip side, our server was really sweet, the drinks were great, and the atmosphere was nice. I'd come back, but only for drinks.

The last time I was here for a Bday party and we all hung out in one of the back rooms played darts, had a few drinks, and socialized ...  People are usually a bit more social here and not quite as snotty as some of the other spots in the area ... I would recommend trying Kelly's out for yourself because it's way more chill and low key, with less little kids running around who haven't learned how to handle their alcohol yet.  When it's nice out the best place to be is on the patio!",

    "text": "After calling over 10 restaurants to take our group of 12 on a Saturday night we thankfully, finally found Kelly's at Southbridge to accomodate us at 7:30.   Located in a part of Old town where there are over 78 bars and restaurants we found Valet parking right next door to restaurant.   When we arrived, they had our table set up so we all took our seats.   The restaurant was dark and the crowd was mid 20s on up.   The Nay is the service kinda sucked. It took us over 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 minutes to order our food.  By the time our food came it was another 10 minutes we all were hungry.  Another Nay was the music (today's hits, which I loved) but, was really loud so we all were yelling to hear one another.   The Yay is the food is Dope (Young kids Slang for good) My word is awesome, if you watch the Bachelor it's Amazing.   Either way said, this food rocked. My girlfriend and I shared so we ordered the Brussel sprouts, so yummy made with a balsamic glaze with chunks of Pancetta.   We also had the Caprese salad. For our entre we had the slow cooked short rib. Wow was this good. (I shouldn't have worn white).  The rib was cooked in a tomato sauce. Served over mashed potato and topped off with an over easy egg. My husband asked if I ordered a local moco, which is a dish in Hawaii with rice, hamburger steak, topped off with over easy egg and brown gravy.   Anyway, other delicious meals ordered were the Salmon. Seasoned perfect and cooked moist. My husband ordered the Pork chop. Cooked just right so the juice was sealed in.   Overall minus the wait, I have to say a strong Yay to the quality of the food. Come try.",

The short rib was outstanding, I enjoyed the fact they serve it with a fried egg on top. The chicken parmesan came with a delicious sauce that compliments the chicken cutlet very well. The general manager, Kevin, as well as the assistant general manager, Erik, made sure we had a pleasurable dining experience. They were very professional and accommodating. If you're in the area I would highly recommend Kelly's!",

The service was prompt, and food and drinks were good overall. I ordered the Moscow Mule, and the E 6th Ave Chicken Sandwich with onion strings on the side, my colleagues ordered a variety of stuff including the Southbridge chicken sandwich, the fish and chips, and the steak, along with the cheese curds for appetizers. All of them were content with the quality of the food and drinks. Drinks are definitely overpriced here though, the Moscow Mule definitely did not look like it was worth $12, especially when you don't serve it in a copper mug, which was disappointing. Otherwise, it was a good place for a Friday evening dinner in the happening area of Scottsdale Old Town.",

The service that night was really on point, my water glass was never empty and continued even after the bill was paid and we were 2 minutes from leaving.  I had the 6th street chicken sandwich (grilled chicken breast, pepper jack cheese I think, jalapenos and guacamole.  My only complaint was that the chicken breast was paper thin and stringy.  The sandwich was good overall due to the other accompaniments.  Happy hour until 7 thumbs up great patio for when it's not 115 degrees out!",

My boyfriend had been to Kelly's once before and raved about it,  so when we chose this place for a celebratory dinner, on works dime, we thought we picked the right place. Wrong.  We ordered two appetizers...one of them never came.  When asked, the server had forgotten to place the order.  Accidents happen,  but when she brought the pork dish out it was freezing. I'm not talking warm either. Me, the life long vegetarian touched the inside of it and it was strait out of the refrigerator. Gross.       Next we ordered the roasted brussle sprouts. They were absolutely disgusting.  First of all they were boiled. Boiled not roasted. Soggy boiled sprouts with an \"aged\" basalmic sauce.  The sauce tasted fishy and we barely managed two a piece.    Our entrees were decent...I opted for a salad (vegetarian) and he had the ribeye.  Let me be clear,  the kitchen could use some adjustment, but the service was good and the staff was friendly.  Let's just say the next time we go it will only be for happy hour drinks on the cute patio.",

I have to say, this place would firmly stand against the onslaught of my highest expectations, but since I had none it made the experience stellar!  The Arizona Mule, recommended by the server, was great. It came in a tin cup and you guested it, it was pricey. $12+  True to form I was drawn to the most unfamiliar and mysterious items on the menu: Compressed Watermelon and crispy feta (unfamiliar, not to mention gorgeous), and the Trilogy of Bruschetta (mysterious). Both were a welcome and sweet/savory revelation!  I need a raise so I can frequent this place, I totally recommend it for anytime you want to pamper your palette.",

We are a huge fan of soft-seating, being the social type, and Kelly's has arranged couch clusters all over for your seating enjoyment.  Like pool? Want to take on some friends and show off your moves? Kelly's has a pool table, dart board and lots of TV's to keep you entertained... no reason to be bored here. Both times we've been here (on a Thursday around 6pm), they have had a great crowd and lots of fun people. Definitely a place you feel like staying and hanging out in.  Okay on to the important stuff, the food and drink! Kelly's has Happy Hour from 4 PM to 7 PM Mon - Fri. Which includes $3 Domestic bottles, $4 Premium bottles, $4 Craft beer, $4 Wells, $5 Calls, $2 off all glasses of wine and  1/2 price Kelly's cocktails so everyone should be covered with something they like to drink.  Now I need to pull you aside and assure you that the next thing I am going to discuss is a not to miss item. I'm just going to come right out and say it... Roasted Brussels Sprouts. There it's out. I know, I know, you hate Brussels Sprouts, I know I'm not a fan of them either. But trust me, you don't want to miss these. The Brussels Sprouts come mixed with a candied bacon and are roasted to perfection. This is a house specialty and too good to miss. Trust me.

Unfortunately, we went there because we were just hungry, and our first choice stopped serving food at 9 pm. So they sent us to Kelly's.   We chose to sit outside, which turned out to be right under the speaker, blaring old 80's rock. The waitress was nice about us asking her to turn it down a bit, as we couldn't really hear each other across the table.   We ordered a cheese plate, 2 grilled artichoke apps, a Mac and cheese, and wine. The cheese plate was mediocre, nothing special, and smaller cheese plate portions than most we order: 8-10 Marcona almonds, some gelatinous slices that we think were pear flavored, a few baguette slices (& I mean A FEW, stingy for 2 of us), and very small portions of cheeses that really weren't too special.   The grilled artichoke app was a failure for us: way too oily, and absolutely not worth the $10. The leaves were small and not very meaty; I think these were puny artichokes to start. When we were done with it, we felt like we had paid just to scrape our teeth on some leaves; it literally took NO edge off our hunger. (Suggestion: If they are that small, give us 3 halves, or put them on \"sale\" so we don't feel ripped off). In comparison, we just had an AMAZING arti app at a long-standing local restaurant (same name as a city in TX that starts with an \"H\") where it too costs $10, but was worth every penny because it was prepared & seasoned perfectly, moist & meaty, and actually made us feel as if we ate something in exchange for money.  The mac and cheese was the tastiest thing, with a lot of mixed cheeses and a little jalapeno kick - nice.  The wine was fine, but for $10/glass, it should be.  I guess this is a weekend packed hot-spot, I can see the potential. Just don't go here for \"real dinner,\" and at this time, Tuesdays aren't a hot night at Kelly's.",

The menu said mozzarella cheese, but the chef chose to cut a sliver of cheese on top of each 1/8th inch slice. See photos. We were only one of about six folks in the place and they at least could have improved on that appetizer choice. The Guiness was about four bucks, so at least that was a good deal.",

    "text": "I would have given Kelly's 5 stars based on food, drink, atmosphere, and happy hour alone. But the service was not great.  I'll start with the good: There was a huge group of us celebrating a friend's birthday during happy hour. The sitting areas were quite cozy and perfect for a large group. There was a lot of food ordered. The happy hour prices on munchies were great. I tasted the jalapeno dip, fingerling potatoes, and the stuffed mini peppers. The dip was delicious, spicy, and rich. Fingerling potatoes were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and served with a delicious dip. Mini peppers were stuffed with a mild cheese and topped with a balsamic drizzle. So good! The cocktails were priced very well during happy hour and they were great. I had a couple Arizona mules. I also tasted a whiskey cocktail my friend had and thought it was tasty.  The bad: the service! Our server was pretty much non-existent. Most of the time we ordered our food and drinks from the bar. The bartenders were not very friendly. They spent a lot of time catering to and chatting up regulars. Our empty dishes were piling up at our table. Sadly enough, we found an empty cart nearby and cleared our table ourselves.   I think a 3 star rating is very generous considering our experience with service but I rounded up because the good outweighs the bad. We will definitely be back and hopefully I will be able to bump my rating up.",

We started on the back patio, because there were no seats in the front and we are smokers. No complaints the back patio is private and the waitress we had was attentive and awesome. We moved up front so we could people watch and that's when the experience turned sour. I have nothing poor to say about the food. It was great. Bruschetta was great, I had chicken parmesan and despite the chicken being a tad bit burnt and the pasta not all the way cooked it was good. my friends had a burger, and meat balls and they loved it. The problem was the service. the hostesses and waitresses all huddle at the front and hang out, super unprofessional. We asked one waitress to please get our server so we could order more drinks before happy hour was over (she hadn't checked on us in about 20 minutes), and she looked at us like we were crazy. And then was super rude about getting our waitress, instead of just politely taking our order and giving that tab to our waitress. After the experience we said no way to coming here for my birthday, the service just wasn't worth the atmosphere or food. I was really disappointed.",

The drinks were good and strong.  I ordered the Peartini and was afraid it would be too sweet but it was perfect.   We shared an assortment of starters.  All were delicious.  The stuffed cherry peppers were my favorite-what a unique and delicious blend of flavors!  The ceviche was nice and light, the popper dip was fantastic and the short ribs tacos were tasty.   The inside of Kelly's is very old school.  I liked it too but it was cold...I preferred sitting outside under the big tree on a perfect Scottsdale night! They have an award winning burger that we were too full to try but I can't wait to come back and try it! The location is perfect for strolling before or after dinner.  Our service was great. No complaints and looking forward to returning!",

The Classic was amazing! Both the burgers were 100% Angus Brisket Blend. Pretty sure the Classic was the best burger I've ever had!",

This place had no wait, good food, and the price was reasonable for the area.  My only complaint is my girlfriend ordered a burger well done, because she is pregnant and cant eat raw meat.  She told the server this and she said she told the cook, but when we got our burgers hers was bloody red.  Ironically mine was well done.  I have to give them credit, though.  When we told them of the mistake they gave us a new burger and the manager talked to my girlfriend to make sure it was ok.  So even though it wasnt a perfect experience, i'll give them an overall good rating.  I would definitely consider going here again in the future.",

Started to get busy after we sat down.  My favorite thing about this place was the location, the patio, the atmosphere.  We ordered the fried mushroom appetizer which isn't on the regular menu.  It was a special for football.  Unfortunately, it was rather tasteless.  It came with ranch to dip it in and that is the only part of the dish that had any flavor.  The mushrooms were very bready and soo hot inside that the juice burned my tongue!!  For our meal we decided on the Beer Mac n Cheese and the Fish and Chips.  We told them we were going to split them and they were nice enough to split it for us and bring us each our own serving of both dishes!  Nice touch!!  The Mac n' cheese was Awesome!!! So flavorful and delicious.  However, I am glad we split it because a full serving would have been too much... it was very rich and by my last forkful, I started get tired of it.  The fish and chips were not good.  The batter was the same batter they used for the fried mushrooms.  It had no flavor.  The fish itself was also pretty tasteless.  The chips were ok....thinly sliced potatoes that weren't that hot.   The service was fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary but no complaints whatsoever on that front.   All that being said, I would definitely go back!!  I think I would get a burger next time...I read they won an award for their burgers and their patio!!  Even though our food choices left us dissatisfied, I know that there is something better on the menu for the next time.",

    "text": "Came here for a friend's birthday.  We were a party of 15, but we had a nice spot in the restaurant for our group.  The place was packed and the decor is nice.  It's a nice addition to the old town bars in scottsdale.  Before I go to a new restaurant I like to check out the menu beforehand online.  The menu looked great online so I was excited for dinner.  When we got to the restaurant though, the menu was only a portion of what was posted online.  The options were limited to say the least, and we were disappointed.    I ordered the cheviche as an appetizer and then the fish and chips for dinner.  The cheviche was good, not great.  The tortilla chips that came with were more chewy than crispy.  The fish and chips were also good, but I was surprised that the chips was literal vs. the british \"chip\"/french fries.  They were homemade and yummy, but just not expected.  The aoli was bland, could have used more spice.  Considering the prices it could have been better, adequate, but not something I would say \"hey, let's have a great dinner out at Kelly's\".  There are other restaurants in Scottsale for that.  My friend ordered the roasted chicken, which was one of the rare non-sandwiches on the menu, and she loved it.  It's decent quality food... good but not great.  The wait staff was pleasant, but we were left unattended too much.  The bussing should have been more frequent and we were left trying to hunt down the waiter to get our checks.  He did offer to split them up individually, which is rare, so that was appreciated.  Overall I'll go back for drinks and the atmosphere, but I would prefer to eat someplace else for a big dinner out.",

We were seated outside per our request and waited over 15 minutes for our server to show up-although her bus boy brought us water. When she finally showed up, we ordered our food and drinks right then, so we would not be left alone for another fifteen minutes. I had the gaslight chicken sandwich which was super dry-I wanted to ask for a side of italian dressing to dunk it in but our server proved that her inattention was more of a habit than a fluke. Also wanted salt and pepper, never saw that either.  Hubby had the   'famous\" bleu cheese  burger (four kinds of meat! whatever) and it was very tasty, as were the homemade chips.   Sit on the patio and enjoy the very hipster, beautiful and drunk patrons-drunk being the keyword here. Also creepy taxi drivers that also appeared intoxicated hanging around the front door. We will try it again, but earlier in the evening and I will avoid having Jaqueline as a (non) server.",

Even though the bar became pretty packed (Spring Training), the service was consistently great the whole time.We had the Haloumi cheese stuffed cherry peppers as well as Ahi tuna cups. Both appetizers were delicious.Cocktails were really good and we also sampled some Jameson whiskey and ginger ale from the Jameson girls. It was overall a younger crowd last night but there was enough of a mix that it made for great people watching.",

Everything I wanted was not available.  Once I received my food, it wasn't the best either.  It was a sandwich.  How hard is that to make?    Anyway, this place is better for drinking and going out, not eating.  All of the old town people go here now, so it's one of the new hot spots.  I'm not sure I love the crowd though.  It's filled with bitchy girls and douchebags.  Check it out for yourself if you'd like.",

But the bartenders definitely played favorites. Passed us a couple time. Then went 'in order' and passes us a couple more times. Even went to the opposite side of the bar for friends.

Ok, so Kelly's seems to want to be an Irish pub/bar.  It's huge and every room has a different feel.  The bar itself is very pubish (nice wood, cool globe lights) however, the patio would be best described as Tuscan (a region not found in Ireland).  There's a private party room with couches.  Then a secret patio with only three tables.  A hidden room with darts.  An open area for maybe more private parties.  A \"lounge\" area with chandeliers (definitely not irish chandeliers).  The drinks were good.  The food looked tasty but small servings and big dollar signs (actually, the dollar signs were in a normal font size.  It is the numbers behind them that made me uncomfortable).  I got a vegetable sandwich with salmon on it.  I intentional called it vegetable with salmon instead of the otherway around.  But it was very tasty.  Great picnic food! Medium for an irish pub though.  It's a satisfying bar but don't expect it to be what you picture when you hear \"Kelly's\".  I'd return if friends were going but I wouldn't choose it on my own.",

    "text": "The first time I was here was for a party of about 30 that I had planned. I had never been here before, or even heard of Kelly's. I just knew the area that we wanted to be in and used Yelp to find a place with good reviews. I called and made the reservations but was leary after talking to whomever answered the phone. Leary because anywhere else I had called had me speak with someone in catering, asked a bunch of questions and would email me a quote. This was nothing like that, but everything worked perfectly (you can read my initial review about that experience) I was recently tasked with planning another party, this time a birthday for my boyfriend. Kelly's was my first choice. I called and made reservations easily and was very excited to go there again.A few of us arrived about 10 minutes early, and they accomodated us by rushing to clear off the table that was reserved for us. As experienced the previous time, staff was friendly and service was great. Here are the reasons I lowered my review to four stars, rather than 5 again: 1. Most of us did not have utensils, napkins or plates by the time appetizers were served. 2. My boyfriends burger was very undercooked (medium, maybe even medium rare rather than well-done). He's kind of picky, but didn't notice right away (it was dark outside) but lost his appetite once he saw how pink and bloody the burger was. He told the server who offered to replace it but he declined. And still paid for it. In my opinion (and I've never worked food service so this may not be realistic) but if you're going to offer to make him a new burger, and he declines, why not  just not charge him for the burger instead? 3. Location of our table. We were on the patio at a table long enough for the 16 of us there. Our table was off to the front side of the patio near the entrance and is quite narrow. There would usually be enough room still for people to walk past us when everyone was seated, however there was some holiday decore out which took up a bit of space. Customers and staff still continued to use this walk way continuously bumping into us or making us move our chairs in while we ate. So all that said, had this been my first experience, I would have scored Kelly's with 3 stars. But here's what made a potential 3 star review, a 4 star review 1. Our server Sarah. She was the same server I had at the previous event. She is friendly, patient and knowledgable of the menu. 2. Our water glasses were never less than half full. 3. The food and drinks were brought out almost as quickly as they were ordered. 4. We asked for, and got, individual bills (you'll understand what a big deal this is for us if you saw my review of AMF Lanes). So all that, plus the experience of our previous visit increased my review from 3-4 stars. This is one of my new favorite restaurants, hands down.",

I'm guessing the Waste Management PHX Open crowd all headed that way. So after trying 3-4 restaurants and getting 2+ hour waits, we came to Kelly's. It was around 730PM and the bar scene was already in full force but we found a table right away. I got the short rib tacos (appetizer) & they were okay. There was red pepper on it that was super spicy and overpowered the flavor of the meat. But once I took those off, I got more flavor and they were better. My boyfriend got the Kelly's burger, it was pretty good. Total was $42 for one glass of red wine (14 hands merlot -- $8?), 1 beer, short rib tacos, & a burger. It wasn't bad but just with all of the choices near by, I would probably go elsewhere & come here after for some drinks or for a night out.",

My partner had forgotten his credit card after he closed out (I was his DD) so I came back 15 minutes after the bar had closed to grab his card. I thought I was going to be in and out quickly. I stood there, waiting patiently for the bartender to grab the card.... suddenly, I get a tap on the shoulder.. I turned around and it was Martin-he approached me aggressively (the reason?!unbeknownst to me!) He asked me \"who do you think you are walking in here like you own this place?\"  I was completely thrown off but I carried on to explain to him that I had spoken to someone and was already being helped yet he continued to aggressively question me. He made a scene and I felt completely disrespected as a regular patron for this establishment. My partner and I had spent a lot of time and money the past Saturday and Sunday. I did not deserve this!   I asked the bartender who he was and I was told he was one of the co-owners and he kindly apologized on his behalf.  This completely ruined my experience at Kelly's Southbridge and I will not be going back.  I highly suggest management address this vile behavior in the future. I nor any of my family and friends will be returning.",

The staff is nice and not pretentious or thinking they are better than you. I get service with a smile and sometimes a good conversation. I have also been here during the day for networking and the space is big enough to hold large crowds. I had food and it was tasty. They had salads and tacos with their own spin on it.   The DJs they hire I personally like because they play good music to dance to and keeps the crowd engaged.   I need to try more of the food and go earlier but the drinks and night life is fun and I enjoy going. It's alway away from the other nonsense which helps with less crazies at night.

The Good: The female bartender in the patio little bar area was super friendly and great. She had a good attitude and even helped some of the girls with drink suggestions which they liked.   The Bad: The female bartender in the main bar area cannot mix drinks at all, and couldn't even make Long Island iced teas... She had no service skills and seemed angry with life in general... We avoided the main bar after 3 rounds of her dismay even after tips...   Music was decent, atmosphere is really cool. It seems like a good spot to try to have dinner another time.   The outdoor patio has some good furniture to hang out with your friends on.",

The chicken sandwich was good, and we loved the fried onion straws! Our waitress was friendly, and the ambience is nice. The happy hour deal is okay, but prices are more reflective of the central Scottsdale location than food. Overall a good experience!",

Some how I managed to set my beer on an uneven surface, \"timber!!\" my shoe filled with beer. No big deal, we can clean it up, but....the waitress  looked at me, as if I had ran over her cat. It took about 3 more drinks for her to be remotely friendly, I guess a big tab is worth a smile.  I closed out after sitting and chatting for awhile, the bill was decent and I left a below average tip. Shit hit the fan. As I ordered an uber, the manager came to ask what was wrong. After speaking with him, the waitress came and confronted me while I was trying to leave. Thanks to her I met the big security guard who walked me to my uber. Just turned into an unpleasant experience.  One I will always remember, but never recommend.",

    "text": "About eleven of us were meeting up for a night out on the town and I decided we should meet at Kelly's since: a) I have never been there and wanted to check it out (IT'S ALL ABOUT ME!); and b)we wanted some food in our stomach in case we decided to drink a little (aka a lot).  The patio wasn't open yet, so we sat inside in a very large, but comfortable booth. The outside patio is very spacious with clear lights wrapping around trees and iron posts and with its own bar tucked nicely into the corner.The inside bar area look sophisticated, but casual, and the lighting throughout the restaurant bar was dim and for some reason I couldn't help but be reminded slightly of Mabel's on Main.  The food was pretty tasty and while the prices aren't ridiculously high, I think they are a little overpriced. My friend ordered the calamari ($9) that came with a delicious spicy aioli dipping sauce. I wasn't a fan of the tempura fried calamari itself. I  felt like there was too much tempura that you couldn't taste the calamari. I ordered the poached pear bruschetta ($9) that was layered thick with soft bleu cheese and topped with garlic shreds. It was okay, I don't think I would order it again. My other friend ordered the Shaft Bleu burger ($14) that came with fries. The burger was a normal size, I didn't taste that, but the fries were deliciously crisp and fresh tasting that some other friends, due to the sampling, order a side all by themselves.   Onto the drinks! Everyone was happy with their weapon of choice and we did not have any problems with drink preparation like some of the other Yelpers. Since Kelly's does not stock Hendrick's, I went for something different and chose their Strawberry Shamrock drink ($10). I quickly became addicted and highly recommend this beverage consisting of strawberry rum, cucumber vodka, muddled mint, sweet n sour, and soda water. My one friend tried the Moscow Mule (after handing over her ID for the server to keep so that she doesn't steal the copper mug that they serve it in - weird) and she also tried the Arizona Mule, which differs to the Moscow Mule due to the addition of grapefruit bitters and that it is served in a silver mug (but she didn't have to give her ID back to the server for that one). She recommends staying with the Moscow Mule.  The service was great, even with our large party. The bathrooms were clean, but small for the size of the restaurant. All in all, we would come back for drinks, but undecided about the food.",

We started our dinner with happy hour prices and got a pretty good bottle of wine half price for almost what it cost you at the store and those tasty Haloumi Cheese stuffed cherry peppers for only $4.00.  We went with burgers for dinner and I have to say my nearly perfect burger was the most delicious burger I ever had out and is deserving of a more fitting name like maybe Mary Poppins, Practically Perfect in Every way! I tried what they named the sweet chili Burger. This burger doesn't need cheese or bacon or even sauce to make it taste good. This burger was really different and creative with layers of flavors and the perfect bun to meat ratio. The roll was buttery fresh and lightly salted and never fell apart while eating the sandwich. The delicious patty is made of Short rib , sirloin , chuck and brisket and is also seasoned. Toppings were pickled fresno chiles ,onions , cucumbers and under the patty were greens. This combination was a flavor bomb! My only minor criticism is the patty seemed a bit dense and maybe the meat was packed too tight. The side I picked were the mixed vegetables and they were beautiful above average vegetables including broccolini and wax beans. I really enjoyed this burger.  My husband enjoyed the Kelly's Original Burger and had the tasty perfect onion straws with it.  I also purchased a Kelly's local dines dot com certificate and saved a good amount of the bill with that too.  That seems like an overall five stars to me.",

Mine came with sauteed vegetables & burger came with tasty seasoned fries. Great service, GREAT food in a warm, friendly atmosphere will keep us coming back! My only TIP.. We'd love to see reasonably priced ($5-6) \"Appetizers\" or Happy Hour specials like Spiced Meatballs, (Which were served at Anniversary event)  Mini-Sliders or Tasty Brushetta Bread with Tomatoes & Aioli toppings... ?",

Some friends and I were here for happy hour and things started off great - great drinks, great apps - had the ceviche and one of the bruschetta's (forget which one and not even sure if thats spelled correctly but it was awesome).   Our friends met up with us and decided that we should stay for dinner. I've eaten there but not a full dinner - their apps are always so good so what could go wrong with dinner right? So we order another app for the table and it never comes out. We make a comment to our waitress and from her reaction, we know she forgot to order it. Cool - it happens, all of us either work or have worked in the restaurant industry and we know what its like when it gets busy.   So she walks away and one of our friends food comes out. She comes back over and tells us that she straight out forgot to order the app and its also been 86'd so we can't get it anyway. Our friend already had her food so we were like whatever, our food will come out soon too. So about 10 minutes later 2 more plates come out. We told our friend to eat before so by the time their food came out, she was well into her dish. We wait about another 10 minutes or so and my food never comes out. So after another 10 minutes we finally get our waitress over and come to find out my dish had been 86'd too. By the time we figure this all out, my friends were done with their meals and I had nothing. Their food was good - Kelly's food is always good.  Our waitress comped my meal and I was able to order something new, but it took another 20 minutes to get that out. I wasn't even hungry anymore and frustrated so I asked for it to go. Normally I don't bother telling a manager or anything, I'm not one to complain too much and usually just go on my way, but this was pretty bad. I had to ask to see a manager 3 times and he was not quick to come to us.  So I finally talked to the manager and am really positive about it all - I really do get it! Shit happens but I think it was really important for him to know what went down. I wasn't looking to get anything for free - I did already when she comped my meal.  Needless to say it wasn't a perfect experience but I will be back because I really do love the place and hope/think this was just a fluke. My burger was great once I got home and I hope my next review will be a perfect 5 star review cause they do deserve that next time.",

So at the suggestion of a friend working in the industry, I scheduled a meetup at Kelly's at the start of our night out on the town.  I can't even remember what used to be here before - but Kelly's is huge. Considering the size of most Old Town bars, Kelly's is like the Mall of America. Lots of difference areas the hang and chill indoors and out is really nice especially when the weather changes. And as big as it was, it did fill up quite quickly, which shows its popularity.  Drink prices seemed average and service was fast (earlier in the evening) but the waitresses that came around seemed to be pretty efficient. I have a group of 17 people spanning 2 tables on the patio, and everyone seemed really happy and having a good time. Next time I am back in town, if Kelly's is around (and by the looks of it I would assume so) I'll probably make it my group meetup again.",

Hands down probably the best burger I have had in town!!  Hat's off to the chef's and managers!!  Will be back on a Friday night to hang at the bar!",

    "text": "We went here on Saturday night for a friends Birthday Party.  It was super easy to make reservations for a big group, and they didn't have a minimum charge like some of the other near by places. We were even able to reserve some \"vip' couch space for the group with only a few days notice.  The Happy hour specials are great! Including half off a bottle of wine from 3-7, even on Saturdays! Food wise, My boyfriend and I ordered the Kelly Burger with Truffle Fries and the beer mac ad cheese.   The burger was really good. The fries were ok- not what we were expecting, they were just regular fries with a tiny bit of truffle oil, so only some of the fries had any truffle flavor.  I do not recommend the mac and cheese at all. My boyfriend wouldn't even eat it and he is much lest picky than I am. The sauce was thin and did not have much of a cheese taste at all, it was actually sweet- which was really gross combined with the jalapenos, ( I think they were pickled, they were very mild) and the Bacon.   Over all it was a great atmosphere, and we really enjoyed the night. (Even without drinking.)",

While we were in here, mainly due to the fact no other venues were open in the immediate vicinity, two drunk trailer trash girls were screaming and yelling at an older dude, who looked like he's been smoking way too much pot for the last 30 or 40 years, for being \"a slut\". I assume these young women thought this guy was their sugar daddy and got pissed off because the old stoner dude was talking to a mom/daughter pair at the bar. Then a group of what I assume were frat bros from ASU come in and start hooting and hollering as well.   All of this happening while the bartender ignored the only well-dressed and well-mannered duo at the bar(us). Pretty amazing if you think about it. I was told by my friend, who moved here from CA several years ago, that this was the norm for Scottsdale and Phoenix. Trashy women who'll be with any dude that spends money on them and a bunch of 30K a year \"millionaires\" dating these types of women. Tacky, classless, and a bit disgusting is how I would describe this venue and this \"city\" in general.",

If you're looking for a great relaxed happy hour where you can even get a little work done at the end of the day, this is the place. Sure it gets real busy at night, but this place has something for everyone. Lauren and Neil are awesome behind the bar. Always quick with a joke or a friendly smile, they make you feel like Norm at Cheers. The drinks are strong and the food is good. If you're looking for a departure from the regular old-town scene, Kelly's is a great place to start or end the night.

    "text": "Went here for dinner a few nights ago.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  This place is most definitely more a bar than a restaurant and probably gets packed at night.  Kelly's seems like a nice spot to relax and have a few drinks.  The decor is interesting with lots of comfy looking couches on which to socialize.  Anyway, to the food...     To start we ordered a round of drinks.  The happy hour specials are pretty decent but the $8 martini ($16 regular price) had an extremely weak pour.  Barely even worth the 8 bucks.  The wings were just ok but the mac n' cheese was pretty tasteless.  For an entree I ordered the burger which was very good.  Perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  I wasn't sure what to think of the side condiments that came with though (some kind of peppers and another mushy spread thing).  The fries were also very good and seemed to be freshly made and not frozen.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her chicken breast sandwich.  I had a bite as well and it was very good.  The aioli makes it I think.  Our waiter/server was very good.  He was courteous, friendly, and didn't take too long with my diet coke refills.  In summary, this place is a bar with above-average bar food.  I probably won't be back, but not because it wasn't good.  It was good but just not that special.  Pro Tip:  get the half price certificate at Local Dines ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FdfR4eQ&s=74666453fa5eb2cd84c02c6801a501dcfbd893c7f5f3b7db84551161c61ab246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/dfR4eQ</a> ) because it is definitely worth it.",

It's literally one of the only places in the valley with REAL cork dartboards, and the setup for darts is perfect, 3 boards lined up next to each other in a dedicated area. I never understand why some places have a single board and position it in a corner near their pool table. Anyway, I digress.  Kelly's is huge, and has an English tavern vibe. There's a large main bar plus one towards the back, a huge patio, a few couch seating areas, and several nooks and crannies with different seating options. Great place to watch any type of sports! I have never eaten here, but they do have a full menu with happy hour. Service is always quick and friendly.  This is always included as a stop for me on a visit to Old Town!",

The barmaid gave us 2 shots that were very warm so my friend complained and told her that shots are supposed be chilled. The barmaid got offended and  called the bouncer and he kicked us out -  apparently you can't complain about the services you're paying for. Very upset.

I'd say food was average and some of our dishes were just not that good. My chicken tacos were cold, otherwise  I might have liked it.  We were a little disappointed and thought there were much better restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  This is more of a place for drinking and hanging out(based on all the drunk college crowd there) I wish I read through the reviews more thoroughly-the manager did admit weekends is a bar scene.",

From birthdays to work happy hours, the staff at Kelly's has constantly been super accommodating with large groups and any special requests we might have (i.e. tracking a group bill, having cake, etc.).

    "text": "Kellys is a great spot for groups. We were sat at a huge rectangular curved booth which i originally thought would be good for conversation but honestly the music was too loud to hear everyone which was frustrating. The wait staff was good about my dairy allergy which i really appreciated but I wouldn't say knowledgeable. She basically didn't know anything upfront but in the end we said a few things we'd be interested in and she delivered. We got shrimp tacos which came with rice. And then the burger with an over easy egg in it. It was, to me, extremely mediocre. The burger and egg had no seasoning to it and they brought out a thimble of ketchup which is always annoying to me (i know you can ask for more but still). It's hard for me to dislike anything with an egg on it but it just couldn't save the big boring patty it rested on. The tacos were the same very bland without at least that I could detect a sauce or great salsa component to freshen it up. The rice was bland too unfortunately. Overall it wasn't bad but was very lack luster ... it didn't seem like the kitchen staff took pride in making each dish exciting, unique or well seasoned. However it was a busy night and we only tried 2 items so there's always hope that other items have more pizazz!",

Thankfully they have kept their extended happy hour specials over the summer (until 7 pm!)  Awesome patio space too.  Finally TVs installed outside which will be amazing for football season!  And they are dabbling in brunch too. Sadly the food has not wowed me and when we finally ordered the cheese plate again tonight (which I remember to be amazing) I was left feeling meh. Regardless, location is great, staff is always friendly and we always have a good time. Looking forward to trying brunch out and continue to return for many weekend wind downs.",

Outdoor patio nice with colored lighting, ample spacious table settings and couches. Love that this is a place where the age 30-50's crowd can still have a blast without feeling old and out of place as they would in entertainment district bars.   The three stars have to do with their food and glassware (or lack of). Atmosphere excellent, food ok. Have been here a few dozen times but food just average. As an example, nachos have fake ballpark type cheese, very few toppings and no salsa. We are beer drinkers and their beer selection is definitely adequate, BUT beer served in plastic glasses, even during the day..... not sure why, average day crowd is clearly ages 30-50's demographic, and later at night when guests do tend to be younger, the crowd certainly remains respectful and behaved.   So atmosphere well worth a visit, food and drinks average for Scottsdale.",

We were warmly greeted by the owner and given the grand tour of the place including the putting green, dart room, secret private back patio (perfect for small groups) and then settled in on these great wicker couches on the huge outdoor patio.  Because we were part of a tour, the owner brought out a bunch of free ginger beer & dark rum cocktails (yum!) on the house along with the scheduled dessert course (cinnamon donut holes and a yummy red velvet and marshmallow cake).

At night it get busy and feels like a regular bar, but during the day it has a nice chill atmosphere.  What I dislike is the same I dislike about most Scottsdale venues; both patrons and the servers tend to think highly of themselves.  Everything is priced a little higher.  These aren't deal-breakers, but it's not something I go for if I can help it.  Last time I was here was a gorgeous Sunday afternoon, and our large group was offered a couch on the patio.  The ambiance and weather were perfect.  The server got us excited about half-priced bottles of wine (or champagne) and we ordered some.  It was quite lovely to sit back with good conversation and sip a nice merlot in the 75 degree sunshine.  I'm pretty sure we made it clear we weren't eating, but she kept asking if we were ready to order food.  When we asked for the bill, we realized the reason for her persistence was the fact that the half-priced bottles was only available with a food order.  Interesting tid-bit she left out at the beginning there.  We got a quick side of fries to solve that problem.  I would be unlikely to choose Kelly's if it were up to me, but I'll tag along if I'm invited.  I have no major complaints, it just doesn't quite seem worth the price (if you miss one of the specials or fail to order food).",

I would come back just to sit on the patio sipping drinks and observing a local species known as the Douchebagus Scottsdaleus in its natural habitat. The Douchebagus is a nocturnal creature that  typically travels in packs of three to eight and flourishes in the area engaging in a complex mating ritual that includes consuming copious amounts of alcohol and behaving in an increasingly obnoxious and self-absorbed manner until it attracts an equally obnoxious and self-absorbed mate.  The patio at Kelly's offers front row seating as packs of Douchebagi roam the streets, though this does detract from the classy touched afforded by the gas lamps.  Beyond the front row entertainment, I was happy with the bruschetta and cheese plate and the Jameson girls were there so I enjoyed more than a few Jamey and Gingers (Jameson and Ginger Ale) on special for $4. For dessert I had a greyhound so the amateur-professional alcoholic in me could not have been happier.  Laura was not thrilled about her steak sandwich and made it a mission not to let me order food (did I eat at all that night? I really can't remember) and some of the other people in our group repeatedly had to send back their drinks. The margarita \"tasted like lime juice\" if I recall. But I continued to happily down my Jamey and Gingers. So much that we eventually decided to move on.  I think we did the right thing by starting here then moving on to drunker pastures.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a crowd older than 30 in Old Towns this is your place.  It's a bit more sophisticated than most bars in old town with less of a \"meat head\" feel.  The women definitely had more clothes on than you would normally see in a bar in Old Town. =)  I would say more of a NYC feel to it.  Also for anyone in their 30's/40's this will be more your scene.  I got the feeling the people who frequented this bar actually had real jobs and worked in respectable businesses.     I am going to have to disagree with a previous review stating their Moscow Mule was good.  The cup it came in was cheap and didn't keep the drink cold like its intended purpose, but above all else it didn't taste good either. If you want a real Moscow Mule go to T. Cooks at the Royal Palms.  I only had drinks at the bar so I can't talk about food.  To sum it all up, if you are looking for more classy and less trashy this might be the place for you.",

Chicken salad was nothing special or inventive, but hit the spot, and was a decent size.  Southbridge chicken sandwich with spinach and cheese...yum. Huge sandwich, totally worth it.  I highly recommend substituting the vegetables as a side, rather than fries. They were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Skillet potato appetizer was also really good, well seasoned and delicious sauce.   1/2 price appetizers before 7pm.   Kind of expensive ($14 per meal) but with it for a nice experience.",

My favorite thing to order is the meat and cheese boards which is so delicious, but the presentation is really the best part. It's always different and has tons of cheese and bread and fruit and smears of fruit! Yummy!!   My friends and I really love the atmosphere at Kelly's and always have a great time when we go there. It's a nice place because it's more chill than the rest of the places in scottsdale so you can go out and have fun without the club atmosphere.",

The drink specials on Jameson were great.  I got some Jameson and Ginger Ales for only $4 each.    A couple members of my party were unhappy with their drinks (margaritas, martinis and complicated shots).  My drinks were great, so I cannot complain.  But it is worth noting that anything beyond two ingredients might be out of their expertise.    The food was just... ok.  I ordered the $15 steak sandwich, which came with a handful of fries.  The bread seemed quite stale and the steak tasted under-seasoned.  The roasted bell peppers seemed greasy.  The fries were just okay.  Still, I rarely send anything back and I was quite hungry.    Kelly's is a nice place for people watching, but there are better patios just across the street.  For the price point they're at, I think there are a number of better choices.",

Though we waited just a little, it was enough Scottsdaleness to be a slight turn-off. The atmosphere was very lively and the inside was packed. There are several back rooms and side bars that do make it easy to tuck yourself away from the main area fray. Once we perched at the bar, it was easy to order drinks and I really enjoyed myself. Their huge patio can get you some fresh air if you don't mind the smokers. Typical \"bar with patio\" problems.  One of the best parts about Kelly's is the location away from the Scottsdale club scene. It gives it a classiness that is difficult to find elsewhere and the clientele reflects that. I would like to come back and try their dinner/lunch selections and experience more of the patio from a seated position.  If you're looking for a good place to drink, check out Kelly's. If it's packed, you should probably go elsewhere. It's walking distance from many other places that are cheaper and not as busy... if all you're doing is drinking.",

In my personal opinion, the dbag ratio increases the later it gets, but I guess that's what you expect anywhere in Old Town.

Ultimately we settled ourselves on these super comfortable couches. After explaining our schedule constraints to Ashlynn (who rocks it with her blue tipped hair) our food came out in short order.  Lest I forget, their coffee is served with a treat of sweet heavy cream. I missed the introduction as I was powdering my nose. But it is sufficiently flavored that many may not need sugar. Yum!  Their cheese board is ginormous! I love cheese and was craving something warm so we also ordered the mac & cheese WITH BACON. Yes. That exists. You should try that if you're ever in the mood for some comfort food. Be warned this is 1) not diet food 2) very filling 3) should be shared.   I did not share it.  Go ahead. Judge.  This place is bookmarked for me to return! I definitely would like to sample their drinky treats and lounge when I have more time. Super, super cute place! Big fan of how nice and friendly all the servers were.",

Both were really comfy and inviting.  The place is decked out for Christmas.  Couldn't stop myself from having the cheese board again !! It was soooooo good and BIG. This time our waitress was Ashlynn and she was awesome fitting lunch into our time constraint.  Also tried the mac and cheese with bacon it made my friends taste buds sing, but was a little too rich for me. Great shared item though.  Too bad we didn't have time to have some wine or dessert.  We will sure to be back when we have longer to stay.",

Comfy seating that makes you want to lounge around while chatting with friends.  Creative cocktails like the pumpkin martini.   Moscow mule served proper, in a tin cup to keep it freezing cold.  They have good happy hour specials like 1/2 price wine bottles and girls night out.  We had a good time playing drinking games and catching up.  Maybe next time, we'll have more than just drinks.",

The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an \"award winning\" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly's twinkie.  Both were excellent!   I was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I'm glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!    I can't wait to go back to Kelly's!",

We enjoy coming here because it's relatively big and comfortable.  There are large sofas and love seats sprawled through one section of the bar, so there's plenty of room to relax.  The bar top is very wide, so there's plenty of room for your drinks and food.  There's even an outdoor area when the weather is nice....something for everyone.  That's why we like to come here....very few complaints from our clients and colleagues when we choose to meet up here.  Will have to try the food one day.  Return Factor - 90%",

The coffee tasted terrible (green!) we were told it was fresh brewed, the whiskey was either watered down or barely a 1/4 of a shot. For the whip cream they used powdered creamer. There were little lumps of creamer floating on top of the coffee.  I cannot recommend this restaurant/Bar. The food maybe ok but we won't be back.",

The best part of the experience was our waitress who was friendly and helpful throughout our visit. She was fantastic, even when I was being ridiculously indecisive. Anyway, we each got a drink, I got the AZ mule and my friend had basically a vodka cranberry... both drinks were fine, but nothing special. For food, I had the pork wings and the short rib tacos. The pork was alright, tender and covered in a flavorful sauce, but the meat itself was a little gamey tasting. They were served over a super tasty spicy slaw, which I could have eaten all day. Despite this, I don't think I would order this again. The tacos were also fairly tasty, 3 tiny tacos with hot red peppers on top of short rib.... how bad can it be? Again, it was good, but not something I would crave necessarily. All the food and drink were reasonably priced on hh. I would come back here, but maybe order a bit differently next time.  PS I don't know what was going on, but their bathroom when I went was missing a door handle and a lock... could make for an awkward night...

Things tend to get crowded quickly, but I felt there were tons of places for me to stand or sit down without getting smooshed (I'm a shawty). I went during Happy Hour so the drink specials were great. $4 for a well drink. Normal hours seemed to have slightly expensive cocktails for my taste, but nothing horribly overpriced. My friend and I split the chicken sandwich which had a delicious fig spread on it. The chicken was very tender and there was enough food to fill both of us. We migrated to the patio where I had a cider beer for only $6, very tasty. My friend had their strawberry shamrock which was BOMB. Whoa! I barely got a sip in before she sucked it down. Damn Vanessa! It was actually a fairly nice, breezy night last night, which made for that much nicer of an evening. I had a great time and would love to come back and try the full menu. Good luck guys!",

    "text": "We visited Kelly's tonight for dinner around 5:45pm. The restaurant has a beautiful patio, nice drink menu but below average food.  I ordered the sweet potato soup which was excellent and expected the rest of the meal to be the same.  However, my steak sandwich arrived luke warm at best and was room temp by my second bite.  The sauce on the steak was not good and the cut of meat was disappointing (the steak was in little slices like stir fry beef).  My husband ordered the chicken and squash ravioli that came floating in lightly flavored water (not sure what the sauce was supposed to have been).  And the music was way too loud and strange. This is not a place we'll visit again.",

    "text": "New place in Old Town Scottsdale and so far, not like other bar/restaurants in Old Town --IN A GOOD WAY. Cool crowd.  The decor is very retro-chic.  I love the little top hat lights over the pool table.  They have private party rooms to reserve so it's a good place to plan an event.  The outside deck is amazing.  One of the more spacious I have seen.  The best part is the FOOD!  They have brussel sprouts on the menu that will make you reconsider everything you thought of brussel sprouts.  The chef came from a famous restaurant in Phoenix (I can't think of which one --I know they told me!).  So he is top notch. Even the mac & cheese was unique enough for mention.  Had the flat iron steak sandwich--very flavorful.  My husband loved the chickpea frites.  I thought they were OK--they tasted like a funnel cake without the powdered sugar to me.  Otherwise, the drinks were good, the crowd was fun and the place was special.  I am not your typical Old Town Scottsdale person (married with 3 kids!) but when we do make it out there--we will go to Kelly's again.",
