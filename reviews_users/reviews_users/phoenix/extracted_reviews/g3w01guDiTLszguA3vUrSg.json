    "text": "Having tried hot pot first in San Francisco we were craving it and hoping they had some back home in Phoenix. Sure enough, we found Shabu Fondue. The broth options are more extensive than other places we've been to and the spicy mala had a very nice spice level and great flavor. We got 2 orders of kobe beef... I mean come on, it's kobe beef. 2 orders of lamb, an order of broccoli and an order of white beech mushrooms. Needless to say the kobe beef was amazing. The lamb was a tad fatty but had a good flavor to it. The mushrooms were great, the longer they sit in the broth the more flavor they absorb.  The broccoli is a great addition to the broth. Leave it in for 4 minutes or so and it is beautifully tender and has soaked up a very nice spice from the spicy mala broth.  Reasonably priced for hot pot even with everything being a la carte, no all you can eat option available. Portions are nice sized too. Went on a Tuesday and there was a wait.  Good sign. Service could have been more attentive, but not bad enough to keep me away from their delicious hot pot.",

We ordered the ying yang pot(choice of 2 broths) with the Ma long(spellling) spicy and the coconut curry. Both were fantastic but the spicy one is pretty spicy. Our proteins were shabu beef, New York beef, pork belly, and shrimp. We also got some veggies and noodles.   Chef and owner was a really cool guy and stopped of at our table a few times throughout the night. You can tell how passionate he is about the ingredients he uses.   This would be a great place for the whole family imo. You can teach your kids about the foods and they can watch them cook.   We are already planning our next trip!",

Shabu shabu itself means \"swish swish\" which is exactly what you do, swish your food around in tasty broth, let is simmer and get all delicious and stuff. Our waiter was extremely helpful in helping us decide how much food to actually order and what goes well with our chosen broths (the house and a spicy one). The Waygu beef is totally worth it, we ended up ordering a second round. We also had dumplings, shrimp (head off, thankfully), an assortment of veggies and tofu. The chrysanthemum was a surprisingly delicious addition.   The atmosphere is really cool. It's a smaller restaurant, sharing its doors with Red Thai, but service is top notch. They have beer, wine, and sake OR you can order from the full bar next door. We had a delicious sake, served cold, that complimented the meal well. I really can't wait to come back, I am already planning who to take.   OH, don't forget to order some noodles too so after you finish off the other goodies, you can add them and you got some delicious soup! We went with udon, because I insisted. Even though I was super full from our Shabu adventure, I still went for the post-meal soup.",

    "text": "Shabu shabu is a favorite of mine and this is an interesting take on it.  The restaurant is a sister restaurant of a pretty intense asian bar/restaurant next door with huge anime projections on the wall and a club soundtrack.  It is a little more subdued next door but it still has a lounge atmosphere that is very different then most places where i go to stuff my face with meats.    The idea here is that you customize your broth and have a number of choices.  We tried the ma la (sichuan peppercorn) broth and a mild japanese miso alternative.  Just go with the spicy one - it really adds flavor and does not overwhelm the meat.  Tried an assortment of beef and lamb with some veggies and potstickers on the side.  I have always had beef when doing shabu so it was nice to see some alternatives.  The lamb was actually far more flavorful than beef and retained a little extra flavor - definitely recommend it (also slightly cheaper).    Service was friendly but big negative was that halfway through our meal we were informed the kitchen was closing even though it was only about 9:30 on a Saturday (advertised as being upon until 10:00).  That did stop me getting a third order of lamb though.",

I read the reviews for this place months ago but didn't have the time to make the drive. Since my cousin and his wife came to spend Christmas with us, the four of us decided to try it out before checking out Zoo Lights. The waiter was very polite and honest of the portions given and the atmosphere felt very close to the ones I've been to back in Japan. We were very impressed, satisfied and ate to our heart's content. It was a wonderful dinner to have on Christmas. So glad to have found this place. Definitely will come back when craving a night for Shabu Shabu.",

    "text": "So if you're a fan of soup and even more of a fan of choosing your own ingredients, this is definitely the spot to check out.  First off in terms of the ambiance, this is not a restaurant that even looks like it belongs here in Phoenix.  This has that cool East coast or LA low key yet high end type of feel.  Great place to take a date if you want a fun dining experience. The broth selection was excellent from the spicy and lemon grass broths to the flavorful curries.  Then there's the extended menu and the bountiful ingredients.  Choose you own adventure and truly it is one.  Pork belly was amazing and I would advise (if you like seafood) getting the shrimp and clams especially for the curry.  I'll probably try out the Waygu beef next time.  Even the veggie selection is great for those non meat lovers and don't forget to get the enoki mushrooms.  Food was great, atmospherewas great and to top it off the staff was very friendly.  I'd go here again for sure even when it hits 100 + in temps. Next adventure will be its sister company Red Thai. Again, another out of the box concept by the chef and owner.  You'll need to check that out as well cuz it's a trip.  First thing you see is a large wall with Japanese anime playing throughout.  Must see and must experience!!!",

Awesome if you like spicy food- get spicy miso broth!! Also you cook your own food (fyi) so if you want something quick then this is not your place. Have time to spend and socialize. Cost is about $60 without alcohol. I usually get beef, broccoli, mushroom, spinach, napa, and udon noodles. I like that they don't use hot jobs and they use real peppers to make the broth spicy. It's a very healthy meal for the most part but there is quite a bit of sodium, so you leave feeling pretty full. The restaurant is dark inside and has a contemporary ambience.",

We did enjoy the fondue experience, however it would have been much better if the menu was more detailed or if the staff had explained the process better. We had no idea of how many items to order or how much of each of the ingredients would be enough for our group. Our hotspot on the table also quit working in the middle of our dinner. This is a great spot for a romantic dinner. We plan on coming back for a date night soon",

We especially like the option of ordering two different broths along with the great selection of meat, veggies, and a wonderful variety of exotic mushrooms. Alcohol is available as well. If the place not \"hip\" enough for you (but I doubt it), Red Thai is the sister bar/restaurant next door that features an entire wall screen playing nonstop Naruto!",

I've had Shabu when living in Orange County, so I knew a thing or two, but the server still gave some recommendations that I never knew that were very helpful in our dining experience here.  Spent the evening cooking Shabu Beef, Bok Choy, Korean Melons, Flat Rice Noodles, and some other veggies. Ordered the noodles in the end to finish off the meal with a little noodle soup!  When walking in the front door, it's an entrance to two restaurants FYI so make sure you go into the right one. They usually seat you at a table so you wait for a hostess or server.

Including glass noodles which easily get lost on the broth and have no way to keep them together. I like this place it's just not a weekly staple.",

    "text": "Dining at Shabu Fondue is more than just eating , it's an experience. Fondue is a communal / social experience where small pieces of food are cooked in hot oil or broth. That is what you will find here at Shabu Fondue. Upon entering the restaurant , you are warmly greeted and asked if you have dined here before. From there you are shown the 'steps' of ordering. There is not anything besides drinks, Shabu ( hot pot , which is different than Pho), and desserts here. With that, IF you don't want to partake in cooking your own food, or if you want more than this simplistic hot pot menu offers, you're in luck : Shabu Fondue is connected to Red Thai! Shabu Fondue is clean, hip and has a cool , Asian vibe with techno music bumping thru the speakers , but not too loud, just enough for ambience. The tables are set up with the burner for the hot pot in the middle ...& the ordering menu, much like a sushi ordering menu, is placed too. The waitress walked us through ordering our first Shabu Shabu, ( let it be known that a singular 'Shabu' in Japanese means heroine!, although I will say THIS Shabu Shabu could become addictive!) She recommended nine ingredients for the three of us. We did the Ying Yang: two broths that are split in the cooking pot. We did the Coconut Curry and the Spicy Tomato. Both had a little kick but not overwhelming! We ordered : Grass Fed/ Organic Shabu Beef; Head Off Shrimp; Chicken; Bamboo; Watercress; Shiitake Mushrooms; Pork Dumpling; Udon Noodle; Flat Oval Rice Noodle. THIS was a lot ! In a few moments, all of these ingredients and the pot of broths showed up for us to get started with. I could have done without the chicken and the flat rice oval noodle... not for anything more than we just had too much food and didn't finish it all! I am not sure about the recommendation of nine ingredients , as we had both broth and ingredients left and we were all full! There are also two sauces served : a hoisin and a peanut type. The wait staff guides you on how long to cook each ingredient and checks on you throughout the dining experience to be sure all is okay! They even refill the broth base over and over!  Shabu Fondue has a great selection of beers , wines and cocktails! When the fondue is thru, you can move next door for a more traditional bar experience for a nightcap. My tip: show up early like we did on First Friday and we got right in... the place was full within an hour! Also, go 'less' on the ingredients , unless you have a gi-normous appetite!!! You can always add more! This is a fun experience ... can't wait for the cooler months , as this will be the perfect place to go to warm up! Shabu Shabu!",

    "text": "I REALLY wanted to be able to give this place 4, or even 5 stars, but I had to take one off because of the service. I'll get to that in a minute, because the food is worth being the main focus.   The entrance is a little confusing, as it sits right next to Red Thai. People kept coming in, thinking they were going into Red Thai, which is directly to the left of Shabu Fondue. Same hallway, different doors. It's weird.   We went with the ying-yang broth, and opted for the coconut curry and lemongrass. We figured the flavours would be complimentary enough, without being too similar or glaringly different, and we were right.   We ordered the Shabu beef, pork belly, baby bokchoy, Korean pumpkin, udon noodles, and shrimp. The star of the meal was definitely the Shabu beef, though I think the pork belly ran a very close second. The Korean pumpkin was surprisingly good, especially in the curry broth. I think I would have liked a little more noodle, especially for two people, but it wasn't too bad. The bokchoy was fine, definitely a good choice, and the shrimp was just sort of blah. Based on that, I think we may skip the shrimp and just stick to the land meats. The portions of the meats and veggies were more than ample, with the pork belly and beef sliced super thin. We left completely full, with no room for dessert, trying to decided who had enough room to finish the last piece of pork belly.  The key is to pay attention to the cooking times. When they say no more than 30 seconds, they mean it. Throw it is, fish it out. Don't let it sit in the broth and turn into a piece of shoe leather! Both the meats were so tender, and neither broth overpowered the actual flavour of the meat itself.   In the end, my lady friend decided she preferred the lemongrass to the curry, and I think I enjoyed the curry more, but then I'm a curry fiend!   Now for the reason I had to take a star off... The service. The service was awful. We were seated, handed water, and a menu, and that was it. After about 10 minutes the server came back and asked if we were ready, we said we still needed a couple minutes, and asked if we could order drinks. A few minutes after that, a different server (this one a dude) came up to take our order, and hand us our drinks. He seemed disinterested and distracted, and it's not like they were busy. We got there soon after they opened for dinner on a Sunday, and there were only us and 2 other tables, both of whom had already placed their orders. He rushed through our order, then left. Came back a little while later to get our broths going, said nothing, left again. Came back a little while after that to bring us the meats etc. Ran through the instructions ridiculously fast: Beefis15to20secondsbokchoyis30secondsnoodlestwominutes etc... Then left again. We didn't see anyone else until we were almost done with our meal, and I had to flag someone down to get more water. No one came to check on us at any point during our meal, and both of our drinks were completely empty. We had to flag them down to get our check, too. That they brought back pretty quick.   I've been to Red Thai next door (same owner), and the service there is always great. Not sure what was going on at Shabu Fondue, but I just wasn't impressed with the service at all. If the food hadn't been so good, I probably wouldn't go back, it was that bad. However, the food really was excellent, and we're excited to go back and try the different broths, and different meats.",

    "text": "9/29/2018 Yelp review Phoenix AZ Shabu Fondue 7822 N 12th St, Phoenix, AZ 85020  ~15.2 mi (602) 870-3023  Shabu Fondue is one of the best local locations found in Phoenix, Arizona where you could find a delicious bowl of hot pot. This restaurant provides you with the option of either a vegetable or regular based broth and you can even makes things interesting by combining two broths into one large pot or have a pot that splits the two so that you have your options. There are many regular based broth options that include the Coconut Curry, Japanese Miso, or even the Spicy Lemongrass. My personal favorite regular based broth that I always order is the Spicy Red Thai Curry flavor because it easily connects its flavors to the meats and vegetables. The broth is only about $5 which is a good price considering the huge pot that it comes in. The restaurant serves two sauces which are the peanut based sauce and their own uniquely blended soy sauce and they are absolutely free. My personal favorite is the peanut based sauce and in the end I always ask for extra. The restaurant provides a wide variety of different kinds of meats, seafoods, vegetables and sides such as dumplings, eggs, or different types of meatballs. The main foods that I order are the Kobe Sirloin Beef, Shabu Beef and Kurobuta Pork Belly and I sometimes order either the Shrimp Puff or Cuttlefish Puff as my side. The Shabu Beef is about $7 while the Kurobuta Pork Belly is about $8 which to me are reasonable prices especially with the large portion and flavor they have to offer. The puffs are also about $4 which is also not too expensive as they serve as a delicious side. Yet, my boyfriend and I favor the Kobe Sirloin Beef the most which sits at a price of $16. The Kobe Sirloin Beef alone does not fill us up, but it is well worth the price given the texture and quality of the meat. The average bill is around $60 which can be a little expensive, but to me, it is worth it once in a while to go.  Whenever I go to Shabu Fondue, I realize that the lighting in the restaurant is pretty dark which makes it hard for me to read the menu and eventually makes me drowsy. Yet, while I am drowsy, they always blast their music which could be irritable to a lot of customers. The walls of the restaurant are decorated with an Asian theme which represents the type of food that they serve which is quite a nice, warming touch. This allows the customers to feel a sense that they are actually experiencing and taking a part in how the Asian culture actually is.  Whenever I visit this restaurant, there is always a decent amount of people dining which causes a wait that could go from half an hour to an hour. The waits can be so drastic because all of the tables may be full or the tables have yet to be cleaned. Yet, in my last visit, my boyfriend and I were starving and we had to wait outside for twenty minutes, but when we looked inside, there were three available tables which caused us to question the restaurant's decision to make us wait. Other than that, the server took our order right after we filled the sheet out, checked if we wanted anything else, and the waiters or waitresses would constantly refill our waters. Overall, I would give 4 out of 5 stars to Shabu Fondue for providing their customers with great service and delicious food to eat.   I encourage everyone to try Shabu Fondue at least once if you are around the area. If you are looking for a quick meal, this is not the right place for you. If you do decide that the wait and prices are worth it, then you should expect a delicious meal that will fill you up.",

We ordered House Chinese Herbal and Japanese Miso, both are healthy and relative light soup.  -For meat, I highly recommend New York Angus beef, Beef Tongue and Prime Lamb. -For sea food, White Fish, Sweet Shrimp with Head On and Clams are all fresh and high-valued options.  And the most important: they have very good service!",

We want Shabu Shabu We're talkin Shabu Fondue We try a hot pot just to share it around You say you don't know What you want me to try You cook some bok choy and you go for the beef  We had a good day The cameras don't lie We're coming back down and we really don't mind We had a good day We had a good day  Overall and pretty hot spot for some hot pots!  I came here with a friend whom never been to Shabu before in her life!  What the heck girls been  missing out; poor thing!  Needless to say I was proud to have introduced her to the meal.  She was a vegetarian so we went for the vegetarian broth; Coconut Curry and Tum Yum.  The curry broth was a little to spicy for the both of us and the Tum Yum was perfect.  The pot itself is duel pot so splitting and sharing was perfect!    As for the food we spent the night cooking Baby Bok Choy, Korean Melons, Flat Rice Noodles, Shabu Beef, Scallops, Broccoli, Fish Balls, and Watercress.  Doesn't seem like a lot but boy when you start to cook and eating its a mouthful!  Overall, experience was excellent!  I love Shabu and Shabu Fondue delivers to my liking.  The atmosphere is modern and hot with a funky Asian theme.  Red Thai is next door was a full on bar to finish the night and dessert so why not huh! - Enjoy!",

We decided to do the double soup base and choose the mild ones with miso and chicken broth. We ordered the shabu beef, bok choy, shrimp, egg noodles, mushrooms and for dessert had the Beignets.  Yes Beignets.   Had a group of 5 so it was interactive for all of us to cook and prepare the dinner and enjoyed the time with each other and trying something you do not come across very often.   We ordered at first and then ordered a little bit more later which was very good and allowed us to see if we would need more food or had enough.   The restaurant was busy and all the tables were taken. Was interesting that 90% of the people who were dining were asian.  The restaurant shares the same entrance with Red Thai and there really is no signage for Shabu Fondue but people know it is there.  Very fun little restaurant and nice place to celebrate an occasion. A little on the pricy side but a good time for all.",

We made our selections it can our timely and it was tasty. The only thing we did not enjoy were the straw mushrooms. We had drinks that were kinda like meh not very tasty for the price of them. We definitely enjoyed it though I did not take pics cause let's face it how many pics of the same thing does one person need.

The sign is SO small, you aren't quite sure if you are in the right place.  But, when first greeted at the door, we were asked which restaurant we were there for, and we said SHABU!  Being my wife and I had never been to a place like this before, it was a new experience.  Sitting down at a booth with an electric hot plate built into it?  So cool!  Granted, its kinda the point of the place.  We enjoyed picking through the menu, selecting various meats and vegetables to cook.  Based on the the suggestions of the staff, we chose two of the broth options as well.  Once everything was brought, the staff was great to suggest how long to cook the specific items, as to have the best results.  This was very helpful!  All of the flavors came out fantastic!!  We will most likely go back again, just to try out some more combinations!",

All the staff is very helpful in explaining the ingredients to you and how things work. If you don't want to cook your own food, go next door to Red Thai and quit your bitchin'. This is the kind of place that you go to for the experience of fondue where you cook your food and have some drinks.   All their ingredients taste really fresh. Our favorite two broth combo is Spicy Lemongrass and Coconut Curry. I really like that you can choose between chicken broth or vegetable broth as a base. When your broth gets low, they will come by and add some more of whichever base you have chosen. Definitely try the pork belly and baby bok choy! The servers will give you advice on how many items to start with. You can always start out with just a few and add more as you go.   This is one of those places where you want to take your friends, which we have done and they loved it. It's fun to go in groups but it's also perfect for two!

I finally did a couple weeks ago and must say, it was good, but not as good as I remember it being in Chandler. I went with Amy H and we got the yin yang bowl with the lemongrass spicy broth on one side and the classic spicy broth on the other. The lemongrass was tasty, but the other was somewhat bland and not that spicy. We ordered noodles, fried tofu, enoki mushrooms, beef, dumplings, and pumpkin. The best item, by far, were the dumplings... they absorbed the flavor of the broth well resulting in a great bite. The beef was my least favorite.... it just didn't soak up the flavor well in my opinion and tasted like plain beef. The peanut sauce they gave us saved it at least. The rest of the items were alright, nothing terribly special. I felt that for the price, the food just wasn't that great; however, it may be better with a bigger party (less expensive and more variety). Would I go back? Yes, most likely, but with a bigger group next time.   PS the pea shoots weren't on the menu when we came, those were the best!",

    "text": "So I'll start by saying that I'd actually give it 2 stars (for the large meat portions), but the 4 star average needs to be brought down. If you know anything about shabu shabu or hot pot, this is not the place to go. Everything is sold a la carte, which I've never seen with shabu shabu-- usually there's just a large platter of vegetables that comes with the meal and then you can add extras. And the big no-no, was the sauce! They offered only two: soy sauce (really?!) and some type of sesame sauce. That was it. Anyone who knows, shabu shabu needs a variety of dipping sauces, especially a good ginger one ;) And our order of Napa cabbage (it it was so lacking in amount) and dandelion greens looked like it'd been sitting in the pack of a truck for a few days (I've added photos as evidence).   Even worse than the failed hot pot attempt was the inattentive service. There were only two servers in the dining room and they never checked on us. I had to flag them down whenever I needed anything and they never once asked how things were. Luckily for us we were comfortable cooking at the table, but the poor older-aged party of six across from us were freaked out and even voiced their frustration to the server that no one had come to check in with them.   I question how Shabu Fondue has received such rave reviews other than the people who are coming are just inexperience hot pot eaters and are just in awe by the style of eating/cooking. Who knows? One thing I know for sure is that this is definitely not a four star dining experience.",

    "text": "My wife and I had passed this restaurant a week prior to visiting & decided to have a date night. We got a babysitter & drove all the way from Baseline Rd because we were going to see a show not too far from Shabu & thought this would be a fun place to eat.  The saying that first impressions can set the mood... well maybe this restaurant should consider having a more polite, contentious , & courteous staff to greet & serve the customers , And our experience could have been a better one.  Apon arrival we were greeted by one of the rudest young ladies i have ever come across. We said hello and asked how long the wait was. No answer. She was looking down, we said, Hi, how long for two people? She answered, \"hold on\" without looking up. We could see the light from her phone on her face.   A few minutes go by & we walk up to the podium to let HER know there are open tables, and we have a show to get to soon, she says \" i was gonna come get you in a second ..\" And when my wife and i both when seated, we agreed we both heard her mumble something under her breath.  The worst part of our time here was, the experience with our waitress. She looked over at us after we sat down. She was just standing around & didn't seem to be doing anything , and then continued to avoid us for about 10 minutes. She seemed so inexperienced with talking to people. She was kind of pushy, and very impolite and uninformative when we asked about the menu. She was stuttering, and made us feel very uncomfortable, to be honest. The worst part was she smelled like all types of smoke, and it made my wife and I loose our appetite while she was standing there. We finally get our food after it seems 35+ minutes.  WHILE we were eating, she came back multiple times (possibly 4 times) (After we said we were good, thank you) asking \"do you want anything else? We made it clear we would let her know if we needed anything. I've never had a waitress so inattentive to her surroundings. Nobody waved her over , she just kept coming back. We were TRYING to enjoy our date night ... And the smell of smoke came wafting back and forth everytime she came our way. It was quite nauseating.   We were almost late to the show. The food was delcious, but we could have been enjoying it much sooner if the front staff was more contentious. Never had such rude, unattentive service in my life. I probably wouldn't come back if we had to deal with that waitress again.",

    "text": "Thank you Chef Johnny Chu for bringing this exciting cuisine to the Valley.  Walking in, the decor was modern, simple and clean. I definitely felt at peace, comfortable and ready to get down!  Things to know: You will cook your own food (which totally part of the experience and fun!) Try a little of everything, so that you can figure out your likes and dislikes.  How to: Pick your broth (We got the split pot).  Choose your protein(s), vegetable(s), and carbohydrate(s).   Don't be afraid, and ask questions. Make a little soup, or enjoy items separately.  Recommendations: The House Broth, so flavorful and layered.  Watercress, Fish Balls (or Shrimp Puffs). Just trust me. Ask about spice levels. Really, I thought I was tough.  Overall you're going to spend a little money, but think of it as a meal with a side of entertainment. Also, you're going to be taking your time.  Definitely fun for groups, but intimate enough for a night out or a date.  I'll be back! :)",

    "text": "As a hotpot snob I may have a bit harsher opinion than what your average person will review. Also this place tends to attract a lot of non Chinese ppl due to location/decor and name so keep in mind what sort of tastes/preferences you are looking for.  Breaking it down:   No place to make your own sauces. I'm used to NYC hotpots giving you 12 ingredients to make your own delish sauces. I miss things like hot oil, sesame oils, peanut butter paste, chives, cilantro, scallion, etc. They give you a chili hot oil if you ask for it, and normally they give you peanut butter paste and soy sauce. Peanut butter is the most common thing to use for hotpot but this place has EXTREMELY watered down peanut butter paste. The density is actually like that of water. I was very surprised when I went to mix in some soy sauce and chili that it flowed like water...And yea it ruined the taste quite a bit.  Next up, lamb, the king of hotpot ingredients. Honestly it was quite rough, very chewy and just tasted old. Pork belly on the other hand was quite good, along with the beef. The egg noodle was good. I don't recommend clams because they get lost and you just get the shells and have to fish it out...oftentimes leading to just getting the overcooked clam meat at the bottom when you're all done. Bok choy and spinach were great. Ingredients are somewhat limited (see pictures someone posted the menu)  Broths, they have a few spicy options, and somehow ran out of the most popular & spicy option. This was disappointing because we got the next spiciest broth and added siracha and dried red chilies and it was still not spicy at all. It was about 1/3 of a hot cheeto. Blah, very average overall and I was really hoping for a genuine experience.   Recommendations to the restaurant: 1. Get a thicker peanut butter paste sauce/offer more sauces to begin with (ideally a make your own area). 2. Get/serve better lamb. 3) have spicier broths/don't run out of your most popular broth because thats sorta like mcdonalds running out of big macs...  If you're ever in NYC, check out 99 Favors and or Hou Yi Hotpot, you will thank me forever (get reservations).",

    "text": "Not the typical Japanese Shabu. This is Chinese owned and prepared hot pot with the sesame (Goma) sauce. Instead of ponzu sauce they had soy sauce, which I didn't use at all. It doesn't come out with a set of different veggies and noodles. You have to choose from a list. Plus side was there was a good selection of protein (meats, fish, seafood), veggies, and noodles to choose from. The food was good. The downfall is that it is expensive! They need a plate with mixed veggies, proteins, noodles, and combination of all. Otherwise, it gets too expensive to want to try everything. We ended up ordering about 16 items and bill came to be about $87 + tip for 2 people!!!!  Taste: 4 stars (need ponzu sauce. Who dips with soy sauce? Need more than 1 sauce for variety of dipping sauces)  Service: 4 stars (server checked on us but pot and set up was a little slow to start) Price: 2.5 stars (Need combo selections as indicated above instead of one item each as it quickly adds up. Also, could lower cost or option of smaller portion for less price) Variety of food: 4 (should have more fish options such as salmon instead of just 1 - white fish)  Sauces: 3 starts. (Goma was good but need GF sauces. Also, get rid of soy sauce. Need ponzu/GF ponzu instead if you call it Shabu. Other sauce options would be nice too)  Overall: 3.5 - Need some work to get 5 stars",

Stating \"Like I told you before the wait is 45mins to an hour and you don't need to stand there.\"  SUPER RUDE to say the least.

    "text": "This place is really great! I was a little thrown aback by the simplicity of their menu. Think of like those paper slips at sushi restaurants where you order rolls, \"a la carte\". Now, apply that menu concept to things you can throw in a shabu shabu pot!  That's a relief for me. Coming from places like San Diego and Los Angeles, where the options to throw into a shabu-shabu pot are sort of \"fixed\" (like the plate of veggies is essentially always the same), it was nice to have the added choice as a customer to really fine-tune our desired selections.  I came here with my sister and from a broth standpoint, we chose the traditional pork broth. Wow, just the broth alone was light yet full of meticulous flavor! As we added more and more things to the pot, including veggies, kobe beef and NY steak, all thinly sliced, the better it tasted!   We also opted to order some ramen noodles (read not the shitty kind you get from the grocery store, ACTUAL ramen noodles) and cooked them in the pot and it came out full of flavor again.  Finally, as far as dipping sauces go, I really like the sweet and tangy one. You'll see it when you go, it's basically orange-y colored.  From an ambiance standpoint, the restaurant really strives for a low lighting experience. At first I thought they were going for romance-theme (looking from the outside in) but once you step in and hear the music played, you realize they're actually going for a simple, hip yet casual atmosphere to enjoy some really great food!  Btw, the Saigon drink is something you gotta try if you're of drinking age :)",

    "text": "As literally the only shabu shabu restaurant in Arizona I had to come here eventually. I was going through withdrawal so I had to come here eventually.  Saturday night with a group of 2 we had maybe a 30 minute wait. We put our names down and walked to the left to have a drink at Red Thai at the bar. Had some martinis while they played a Seven Deadly Sins marathon all over the wall. Of course you'd have giant projectors of anime.  Table's ready, so we rush our drinks and close out. Turns out there wasn't any point since we could order from the same menu once we sat down -_-  Everything's a la carte - noodles, veggies, tofu, meats, seafood, and broth. They have spicy and nonspicy broths, with pork and veggie base. It'd be a waste not to do the split option. The spicy lemongrass was the best balance of fragrant and spicy, and the thai curry was kind of what I expected, less hot and slightly sweet from the coconut. Definitely enough options for any pescetarian/vegetarians/vegans though.  We went overboard trying as much as we could, to the point of even not finishing. Veggies like the chrysanthemum leaves and bok choy are the best value - the cheapest and definitely the most volume per order. The ramen noodles were nice and doughy, so they had a bite to them.  Didn't get to try to tofu, but most of the meat is good and you get a lot. Baby scallops, lamb, pork belly, and shabu beef all get my endorsement as totally worth it. The kobe beef is the most expensive, but may be worth it to you as the best bite of meat of the night by far with that marbling. The NY Strip and Pork Loin were okay, wouldn't get alone since they're leaner cuts and not the melt in your mouth experience you need at shabu shabu.  Quality of everything is on point but I wish they had some sort of limited AYCE option. There's enough options to go far for your money, but you could easily find yourself 20-30 per person or beyond. But the twists like the Chinese and Vietnamese stuff you wouldn't find at a regular Japanese place was nice. As the only shabu place here, they have my approval for a well done execution.  God damn I miss California.",

We called ahead to see if we can reserve table for 6 but was told no reservation over the phone. We came at the restaurant and were told it is going to be a 30 mins wait. While waiting, we noticed there were empty tables in the middle and one on the left side that could sit 6 people comfortably. We rechecked with the staffs multiple times if we could go sit at either of those tables but were told they are still not ready yet. After 40 mins waiting at the door, we finally got sit down at the table and the only things they did for this table during that \"40 min prepare time\" were sauces and water. I still do not understand the need for us to stand at the door for 40 mins when there are tables clean and ready for us.   To top it off as if the experience wasn't bad already, we found a long blonde strain of hair in our noodle. When noticing the staff, they did bring us another plate of noodle for no charge. That still did not change the fact that there was someone hair in our pot.",

Our server started off kind of bi**hy but got nicer as she dropped the check, how convenient.  They give you general cook times for each item, but after hearing 7-8 different times, and not given a timer or any cheat sheet on times. It got very confusing. The Kobe beef was fatty, the lamb was good. Overall it was so/so. Being our first time having any sort of guidance or suggestions on what to order would of been helpful. It has potential and it's a fun concept. Just falls short.",

    "text": "Since discovering it, I have been here two times. Highly recommend the yin yang option when selecting your broth. Life is too short to simply pick one! Since having this dining experience on both the east and west coasts, I was ecstatic to find a place offering this cuisine in Phoenix. Location is great as there is ample parking. Depending on the night and the hour you go, the wait time can be slightly long due to their limited number of tables. The waiting staff is great, as they will help new diners out by providing suggested cooking times for each ingredient you order in case one is not familiar and want to try something new on the menu.  A few reasons why I didn't rate them a 5: 1) the waiting staff might not be as attentive as you'd like them to be 2) portion sizes are slightly pricey, though one can argue you're paying for the cuisine type and experience 3) You'd think the longest thing to prepare is the broth since it prepares cooking/heating. Ya know, since all of the food is cooked by the diners. However, both times I've come here, the broth comes out first and placed onto the heating platform. To only be evaporated 15-20% while we wait 15 minutes for the uncooked food to come out.",

The first time I came I tried their lemon grass broth (they said it's the most popular) but it broth itself was pretty bland. Second time around I tried the spicy ma la broth? I think that's why it's called. And I also had the Chinese herbal broth. The herbal broth definitely was not that tasteful. The spicy ma la broth was better though. I like that the test of the three I've tried. Although it's also a little bland but after cooking all of the meat and other stuff it's there the broth tasted better.   Dishes wise I ordered beef, lamb, enoki mushrooms, fried fish ball puff, and udon. All of which were fresh and tasteful so I have no complaints. Overall this satisfied my hot pot cravings.  Oh yeah, prices were ok.",

Fondue restaurants tend to be a process and your visit is very time consuming. This was not the case here. Cook times were all 2 minutes or less.  They had a good selection of meats, veggies and starches. We did a ying yang broth base to get variety. Spicy curry and miso. Overall a great experience with a good amount of food. ( was recommended 3 to 4 choices per person)",

    "text": "I'm always looking for something new to try and with the help of Yelp, I found this as the perfect place to have my birthday dinner at.  We were a party of 8 between family and friends.  We found it confusing at first trying to find this place.  Turns out it is housed in the same building as Red Thai and Shabu Fondue has its own door immediately behind the main entrance.  My understanding is that both restaurants are owned by the same owners.  We were all newbies at the hot pot and our server was patient in explaining the process start to finish.  I won't go into great detail here because it's pretty in depth but they explain the broths, cooking times of the meats and veggies, how to cook, etc.  We did 2 yin and yang pots with each pot holding 2 different broths.  We got the Chinese herbal and Japanese miso in one and the tomato chili and coconut curry in another.  All broths were well-liked and the spicy broths (tomato chili and coconut curry) we found to be not spicy at all.  My sister ended up asking for chili paste to make hers spicier.  The ingredients we chose were all fresh and incredibly delicious.  I felt the service could've been better.  The servers were polite but we had to ask multiple times for extra napkins and forks for the children.  Our table was cleared of empty dishes early on once.  As we had a lot more empty dishes piling up, the staff never cleared it.  Just a small pet peeve of mine while dining out, having empty/dirty dishes on the table for a long time.  Our party of 8 had an automatic 20% gratuity added to the check and although the service overall was good, it wasn't a \"20% gratuity good\".  The bill will get high as you want more diversity in your ingredients. It's not a cheap place for a meal but it was a great experience.  I would love to come back here to try out some more combinations.",

    "text": "Came in for a quick bite to eat after work and I might have found my new favorite restaurant. I think I was the first customer of the night, but from the moment I walked in I was showered in excellent service.   Fabian was the first to greet me. Cheerful from the moment I walked in. His explination of the menu items surpassed all expectation. I was surprised that someone of his skill set wasn't working at a fine dining establishment. The only bad part thing was he's not single   After an encyclopedic review of the menu, I finally decided on beef tounge, shabu beef, bok choy, enoki mushrooms, rice noodles, and my personal favorite, udon.  When I handed Fabian my selections I had assumed I would have enough time to smoke a smoke before my meal.   WRONG!!!  I've waited longer for McDonald's slop than I did for a steamy pot of spicy lemongrass broth.   No more than one minute later a different gentleman, Adrian, brought a cart full of eligently arranged meats and vegetables. As he arranged plate by plate delicately around the pot of broth, he gave a quick history of each ingredient and the best method for cooking each. Once all the food was on the table, Adrian gave me his preferred cooking order to help build a flavorful broth into liquid nirvana. Not only did he make great food better by knowing the precise moment to add new ingredients, he made me feel like a chef. (my greatest solo culinary achievement was not burning the box of Mac and cheese)  Once I ate my body weight in noodles and beef, I was treated to my final dish: Sweet Wontons. After my first bite, that's when I knew I had died and gone to heaven. Sweet and tart with the perfect crunch. I would have ordered another plate if I didn't have to purge just to make room.   To bring this review to a close brings a tear to my eye. I only hope I will enjoy a meal such as this again. In conclusion, if you don't have a meal at Shabu Fondue, you're missing an opportunity to change your life for the better.   I've never believed in a higher God, but I believe in Shabu Fondue.",

The restaurant is interesting because it's split with Thai restaurant next door with a big projector that plays anime. I came here on a Saturday night so it was definitely nice. The wait was about 15-20 minutes.   How it works is that a family meal so you can share with the people you eat with. You pick your one broth which is $4.95 and there's a split broth option that's $5.95. Then you choose protein, veggies, and noodles. We had 3 people in my party so they recommend each person chooses 3 items so we had a total of about 11 items which they said its average for 3.   We got the split broth with Spicy Lemongrass and Japanese Miso. The lemon grass was tangy and a little spicy but not too bad but I personally like the miso because it was more sweet.  For protein we got the Shabu Beef/$6.98, Kurobuta Pork Belly/$6.98, and the Japanese Fish Cakes/$4.68. Then for veggies we had Enoki Mushrooms/$2.68, Shiltake Mushroom/$3.68, Spinach/$3.98, and Bamboo/$3.68. Lastly we got Fried Tofu/$2.98 and Udon/$3.68  I really liked the meats because they were really tender and the udon was very tasty too with the Japanese Miso broth. I also like the house sauce on the side where you can dip your meat in because it was sweet and tangy. The whole total was $54 but split for three it was $18 for each. The waiters and waitress were very patient and kind. They explained the menu very well and came around for refill on waters and to lower or raise the heat in the stove. I'm starting to like hot pot now and I definitely want to come back!",

The service was the worst ever experienced. The waitress was slow, not engage, never showed up much and we had the bus boy touring us on the menu plus attending to us.    The  Portions  were smaller regardless of the it serves 2-3x nope. And they made you hit a timer on the Shabu tables and kept asking you to reset the heat temps and timers. Plus by 9pm they were aggravated we were there.. and wanted to close. The place shut down and servers left by 9:30.. so consequently we left at 9:30 feeling awful for closing the place and holding people up just to look at our watches and see it was 9:30pm in Phoenix.   Now when I meet with friends who travel here for work.. we like to rack up a very large bill, I travel with neurosurgeons, CEOs, business owners.. and they make time to enjoy. So I am very disappointed with the experience. Now what I expected; And consequently, our bill reflected that.",

The food was good as always, but the service...man, the service was terrible. The waitress did not want to bec there at all.  She was unenthusiastic and just went through the motions. When i told her our burner was mal functioning,  she was rude and said that's how it is. She leaned over my colleagues and dropped water on her when serving my other colleague.  I had to call her 3 times to take empty plates and glasses away.  I never felt so embarrassed!!  When dinner was over, i asked for the manager. SHE WAS THE MANAGER!!  It was the first time i had to complain aboit someone s attitude to themselves.   Unacceptable.    I am not sure if I will ever come back,  but if i do, i will certainly not invite other people.",

He had pork belly, mushrooms, dumplings, watercress and rice noodles. The broth was amazing!!!! It was delicious comfort soup. All the add ones tasted fresh and delicious. Shrimp was so good. Love the slightly spicy sesame sauce was another fave.... on everything! Service was friendly and quick. Had a drink at the bar while waiting, loved the friendly bartender and the anime movie. Only question, what does salting the cocktail napkin do?",

I usually order the ny strip paired with tofu, baby bok chou and other proteins like lamb or seafood. I highly recommend getting the boneless short rib because it is absolutely tender. I took my friend that has been wanting to go here and she was so amazed of how tender the meat was. I recommend getting a max of 2 veggie plates like bok choy or watercress for example, they give you ALOT. Which is awesome! The service is friendly and attentive. This is a great place for hot pot.",

Both broths were full of flavor, I did prefer the lemongrass over the curry though.

However, I am now a Shabu Fondue person, 100%.  The restaurant is a very whimsical atmosphere and we were seated quickly. The menu is almost like a sushi restaurant where you mark off what all you would like.  We opted for a yin yang pot (with two broths) with a miso and a red curry of some sort. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the items and broths that were gluten free, which is always a plus. Additionally we had beef, pork, Napa cabbage, rice noodles, taro, bok choy, and tofu to add.  Because the heating element is on the table top, we were able to reheat the broth each time the waitress added more. She always brough us more spice to add to our spicy broth once it had become watered down.  Between for of us, it was about $20 a person, but it was *so* delicious and we were so full. I can't wait to go back!",

Everything here is \"a la carte.\" And they definitely over charge for less than ordinary vegetables and meat.   Shabu is Japanese...the restaurant in itself is Thai...it's definitely confusing as their most basic Thai dish, papaya salad was below average...actually it was simply gross. Shabu broth selection was numerous but it was simply flavorless and temperature heat hot...too hot.   Overall it was less than average and the service was mediocre at best. Considering the price that they charge....eating a bowl of Tom Tom soup elsewhere or a bowl of pho (Vietnamese) or even Ramen (anywhere but here) would have been more satisfying than this place.",

This go round we went with the fish balls, cuttlefish balls, shrimp balls, pork dumplings, Japanese fish cakes, fried tofu, bok choy, enoki mushrooms and udon noodles. It was amaze balls (pun intended). I like to make my own dipping sauce of hoisin and sriracha (ask if you can have a side of both) then you mix them together and you get the balance of sweet and spicy/tangy.Then use it to dip your meats and veggies in. Try it you won't regret it. Everything was delish, fresh and prices were reasonable (even though they actually cut the fish balls in half). If you go go with a group, hot pot is definitely a fun time to enjoy with friends/family. We will definitely be returning to get our hot pot on.",

    "text": "Shabu is excelling in many areas, and faltering in just a few. The most glaring area for improvement is in the service arena. They don't come around as frequently as they should and they keep the broth levels really low. This causes the items to stick to the bottom of the hot pot and burn. After your initial pot of broth, they refill it with pork or chicken broth - which is about the same cost as tap water - so they need not be so stingy with it. My favorite items were the enoch mushrooms and pork dumplings. Everything else was OK, but those two items were delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the oval noodles, but my husband loved them, so we'll probably get them again. I also think it's important for the gentleman to tell you not to add too much to the broth before you start dumping large quantities of meat and veggies in... not after. For four of us, it was $93 - and at $50/per couple, there's some room for improvement :)",

    "text": "This was our first experience with the hot pot style of cooking, and we will definitely be back! For those that don't know, hot pot cooking is also known as Asian fondue. They bring you a big bowl of hot broth and set it on the warmer at your table, then you cook the meats and veggies at the table, making your own soup.  This was a great first experience. The service was really friendly and the only hitch there was that the waiter kept forgetting to fill my husband's water glass. He happily explained everything to us though. The menu was easy to understand and order from, and prices were very reasonable considering the amount of food involved- after tax and tip we spent right around $40 for the two of us and we were stuffed. The food was great overall. The house broth was a bit on the bland side- we added a bunch of soy sauce and (delicious) sesame seed sauce to the broth itself rather than to our individual bowls. The meats were thin sliced so that they cooked quickly in the hot broth, and portions of everything were generous. For the meats we ordered lamb and shabu beef and they were both great and cooked up well. We could probably have gotten by with one fewer orders of veggies and been less stuffed at the end of the meal. We picked broccoli, mushrooms, taro, and baby bok choy. I would have skipped the taro as it broke down too quickly in the hot broth and had an odd texture after that, but that was our mistake not the restaurant's. The oval noodles we ordered held up surprisingly well though. If this is what hot pot is and how it's done, I'm definitely a fan!",

    "text": "Out of control deliciousness. I have only been to a few shabu places but this tops the list!  Food is without a doubt worthy of the description: Amazing.   To start off with, lots of choices on broth. It starts with a Pork based broth (unless you don't do Pork I think they have a veggie broth) and then they add a little more flavor. They have all kinds of choices but we chose a white miso, a lemon grass, a coconut (curry I think)and one other.  Essentially a mix of a few so we had the gamut from no spice up through a little  spicy.   Then, the best part for me, was all the items were a la carte. So we blew it out. We had a group of four adults and 3 kids so with all of our broths we were really able to get some variety. Tons of veggies and proteins to choose from. Pork Belly, steak, short ribs, chicken, shrimp, fish balls, bok Choy, bamboo, 3 different varieties of mushrooms, broccoli, noodles, the list goes on and on. We had easily 20 items + and then just proceeded cooking everything up and each time you add something to your pots it makes your broth that much more rich and irresistible.   Don't miss out on the short ribs and the pork belly. All the meats are sliced (shaved) razor thin for quick cooking and tender meaty deliciousness.   Staff made the difference too, most of the party had not been to a Shabu place and none of us had need here before. Waiter took a pretty bewildering number of choices and distilled it down simply and guided us through what to order and prescribed cooking times, etc.  Full bar is available from the attached Thai restaurant that I can't wait to go to and will certainly post a review, stay tuned.   Really a fun and interactive meal. We can't wait to return! It was an experience not just dinner.",

The deduction is because the place gets a little too warm, especially with the hot pot boiling during your meal, that's just me though and you could feel differently. It makes me want to avoid the place during the summer months. The other suggestion I would make to the restaurant is it's awkward during happy hour (if you drink) that you have to go to the bar yourself and pay separately for your drinks. It's a pretty big and seemingly unnecessary inconvenience.  Otherwise, we really love the place and highly recommend it. It's a fun twist on fondue and I've never experienced anything like it.",

If it wasn't for all the reviews on Yelp, I probably wouldn't have been able to find the actual door itself. The sign outside the building is very tiny. It's a square with tiny writing on it with the restaurant name. The only way I was actually able to read it was when I was right in front of the sign itself. Luckily, all the other Yelp reviews mentioned it shared the same entrance as Red Thai.  (Red Thai's sign is way bigger.)  The atmosphere was nice and serene. I appreciated all the Asian decor in there and had fun taking a few pictures. Absolutely loved the Buddha in the front of the restaurant.   Now... the food. The food was good. I've never had hot pot before so it was pretty good for a first timer. My daughter loved it and she's a picky eater.",

My only complaint there is that there were spicy and not spicy options offered. The curry was in the regular section and had enough kick to it in taste and in feeling on our lips. The miso was super good. All the meat and veg was fresh. There was a good variety to choose from. You could really choose your price range according to what you order. There is basic to super fancy. We had a little of each. It was all tasty. We waited around 40 minutes for a table, which was ok when showing up in a weekend wit no reservations.   They were a little lacking in service. Our main server was nice and good at his job, but it seemed like he was responsible for the whole room of tables.  Another server that was helping him seemed less into the task and dodged us whenever possible.  She also turned off our broth instead of turning it down. She walked up, turned it off, and walked away without saying anything, It got cold mid meal.  We noticed that it was no longer cooking the food at all, and  that it was turned off. She dodged checking in on us. It took us flagging down our main waiter to get it back on.  There is another restaurant immediately attached to this one that had a really cool bar with huge Serena with anime and good music. They are connected by a big open door in the lobby. We could hear the music. That was awesome.  Overall we really enjoyed the experience of having hot pot. I would go again if someone wanted that specifically. I would recommend it for that, but say, be prepared to dine for a long time and take it in as a long dinner experience",

I'm looking forward to trying Red Thai at some point. May be a while since I live in Gilbert.  Anyway...  The service was fantastic. I wish I could remember the names of the esteemed young gentlemen that helped us. They quick, personable, and very helpful. My measure of quality service is whether I feel like an honored guest during my visit. And wow were these guys on point in that regard. Bravo.  We got the split pot (Yin and Yang). As predicted the spicy side was considerably more delicious. We got the staples: Shabu Beef, White Meat Chicken, Headoff Shrimp, Napa Cabbage, Broccoli, Baby Bok Choy, Shitake Mushroom, and Udon noodles.   Friends and neighbors it was all phenomenal! All of it, the service, the food quality, the post meal glow. Wow! Next Suns game we hit this place is an EXTREMELY STRONG CONTENDER for our pregame meal.  Thank you folks!  * As promised, a minor public service  For the love of GOD! It's Yin and Yang, NOT Ying and Yang.

Service was good, they'll be happy to replenish any item you're out of, or want to order something new!  My advice, order slow, you can always get more! The servers will come around restocking your broth, as it gets low. My favorite ingredients we had were; fried tofu, headless shrimp, baby bok Choi, and the egg noodles.  Hubby and our sons were the prime rib and chicken!  One star deducted, because I thought the broths were a bit too salty, but my companions did not complain about that! Might just be my preference.

You get to pick the base, either vegetarian or pork broth, and different options for spicy or mild. So many combinations to choose from! We decided t o do the \"yin-yang\" option, where you can have two different types of broths, and ended up going with the gogi broth and spicy lemongrass broth.   Their menu is quite extensive: lots of meat: such as thinly sliced lamb, beef and porkbelly; lots of veggies: such as bok choy, spinach, bamboo, and mushrooms, and seafood: shrimp and mussels. Noodle varieties such as egg or rice noodles, udon or soba. Anything you could ever want!  Toppings that stand out to me are the spiced tofu, shrimp, and porkbelly. mmmm.   One thing I wish they had were more seafood options, but other than that, a fun and unique experience in the valley that is a must try for adventerous and picky eaters alike!",

The broth is insanely good and the options of choices on the menu for meat, fish, and veggies is fantastic. I'm from L.A. and we have some Shabu restaurants there... Shabu Fondue is better than anything I've had in Los Angeles. Totally surprised that we found a place in Arizona for Shabu that will knock your socks off. Service is great, full bar for beverages, and a fantastic selection of food to simmer in their insanely delicious broth. I highly recommend Shabu Fondue. I will be back!!!!",

I was very impressed with quality of meats, very tender and flavorful cuts.   They have wide selections of broths too, both spicy and non spicy. Can't decide? Choose yin yang option and choose two which is what we decided to do. The broth has enough seasonings so no need for dipping sauces but they provide two on the table just in case.  The portion sizes are spot on too, enough to share but not too big to be limiting. The veggie dishes are decent sizes too. Since I'm a veggie lover, I wanted to order 2 of few veggie dishes but our waiter suggested starting with one. I'm glad he did because one was just perfect.   The wait staff was excellent. They came by often to check on us and to refill the broth and waters. They also swung by to adjust the heat level too without being interruptive.   Can't wait to go back and trying other broths and the Thai place next door.",

    "text": "It's sad that this place is the only shabu place in town. I personally love shabu and talked my husband into trying this restaurant with me last week. I want to leave an honest review, hopefully it's beneficial as feedback to the restaurant and customers.  As a native SoCal resident who recently moved here, I wanted to try out this shabu spot. My review is mainly in comparison with the many shabu places in LA that are delicious and decently priced.   This place missed the mark on so many of the basic things. Shabu is all about the sauce. The ponzu sauce and sesame sauce (tastes more like sweet and sour sauce) was off.   The food: the raw beef and beef tongue served to us had black spots on them. When inquired we were told that it because of bruising, nothing wrong with the meat. Ok.. but it is off putting to customers and I've never seen this before eating at other shabu restaurants. So we stopped eating the beef. The tofu bean curd was tough and hard even after being in the pot for 15 minutes. The mushrooms (canned) was salty. The Korean pumpkin was sliced so thin, it fell apart in the pot after a few minutes. The meal does not come with rice.   Utensils: the tongs that were given to us was hard to use and when asked for a ladle, we were given one with food stuck to it.   The ambiance: I'm a little confused, it doesn't feel homey that's usually the ambience for hot pot but striving to be hip Asian with house music playing.  The bill came out to $60 before tip for a disappointing meal for 2 people. I've enjoyed a better meal at in-n-out for $10. I won't be back, and will just have to get my shabu fix in LA when we visit family or if another competitor opens up.",

Place itself is small but we came on a Saturday night about 30min before closing so we were seated right away and had to order before kitchen closed (no problem!). The good: we ordered mostly beef and lamb and the meat was pretty good. We got the ying yang with coconut thai and Ma La spicy broth. I can't eat spicy so I didn't try the Ma La broth but the coconut thai broth was awesome. Foodwise, thumbs up. The not so good: I know that we showed up near closing time. There were still people left there but they were \"cleaning\" the table and dumping stuff on the floor and just left it there... the entire time we were there. I don't know about you but I like to eat in a place that looks somewhat clean. Also while the food was really tasty, I thought it was more on the expensive side. Being spoiled from lots of hot pot places in Cali that are way cheaper (I know, I know). Waiting to try different hot pot places.",

This place is located in a very odd area and split between and Thai restaurant. Although since they don't have any competitor around them, their prices is a little on the expensive side. Seriously who charge 3.98 for enoki mushrooms when its like less than a dollar in the market.   Besides their ridiculous prices, we got the ying yang style and chose spicy lemongrass and Chinese herbal. Both soup was very good. We also ordered their Pad Thai from the Thai restaurant next to them and it was not good. Pad Thai was very saucy and overly sweet! The waiter did warn us about it but I thought it can't be that bad and it was bad... sorry, but pad thai was not my dish. Anyways, I would only come and enjoy the shabu.",

Chose Yin Yang broths (Ma la & Chinese flavors). The meat or protein: pork belly, beef tongue, chicken, boneless short rib, head on shrimps and tofu skins. Veggies: broccoli, baby bok coy, enoki mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms. Others: egg noodles (similar to ramen) and pork dumplings. There were two types of dipping sauces: soy sauce and some sort of peanut sauce. Everything was wonderful. Both broths were delicious and tasty, quality of the meat was great, veggies were also fresh except for the enoki mushrooms (a bit old). The head on shrimps were also okay in terms of freshness. All in all, it was a yummy dinner. Service was attentive and quick. Would definitely be back here in the future.",

My bf and I went on a Friday evening, waited about 15 min. We ordered the Yin & Yang broth, which is two different broths with pork base. I had the Japanese Miso and he had the Kimchi one. The Japanese Miso didn't taste like miso, it was very bland. I ordered it with the shabu brisket, Napa cabbage and bokchoy. My bf ordered it with short rib meat. The quality of the meats were pretty good and the serving on the vegetables were huge.  Maybe we'll be back again and try it out one more time. Maybe the broth that day just wasn't as good? Or maybe I gotta try a different one next time.   But all in all, if you'd like to try out Hot Pot/Shabu, this place is the closest you'll get near Phoenix.   Also, word of advice. You don't have to take out the beef in 30 seconds, you can just leave the meat in and all the vegetables. It's not fondu cheese LOL",

    "text": "Shabu Fondue is a casual Hot Pot Restaurant. They offer many quality proteins to choose from, vegetables, tofus (including house made), noodles and more that get cooked by YOU dipping and swishing food in a broth hot tub. You have your choice of nine broths that are either vegetarian or not and an option to split the pot into two selections. A server advises you on how long to cook things.   The difficult part is deciding on what you want to try and how many selections that you should make so it's important to ask any question that you might have.   Our server recommended 3-4 options per person but also suggested to get less than you think because you can always add on. We also didn't know what beef to pick but our server was helpful and suggested the Angus Beef Short Rib. We made our selections and before we knew it a big Bubbling Pot arrives with all the sides we ordered.   It's important to only cook a little at a time or you will have over cooked food and lots of cold food.  We split our pot with Spicy Mala Broth and the Spicy Lemongrass. Both were absolutely delicious.....(but I did like the lemon grass more). We started with White Fish and some of our vegetables. The Fish and vegetables Tasted Great and very flavorful in both broths.  We also tried the Chicken in both broths with some vegetables. We both liked the Chicken more in the lemongrass. The flavors really rocked!  Then we try the Angus Short Rib with some vegetables. The Beef was very good and really did melt like butter in the mouth.....We both thought the beef was better tasting in the Mala Broth. By this time I'm over stuffed but my husband isn't.  We saved the Egg Noodles for last with some vegetables. My husband got to eat all the noodles with remaining vegetables himself so I guess for us 7 selections were about right.   Service was helpful and efficient. The servers all work as a team so everyone takes care of you.  In the end the food was absolutely delicious and this also was a relatively great value that I also appreciate.  YUM!",

For example, our last meal, we selected the lemongrass broth and the miso broth. It's served in a sectioned pot. You then select all the items you want to cook in the pot. I recommend the chrysanthemum leaves, the acorn pumpkin, all the mushrooms, and the fried tofu.  As far as the meats, it's been awhile, but I recall the pork belly being my favorite. The server brings out the dishes and goes over the cook time for each item. And then you cook, eat, and enjoy!  I like this place because it's also vegetarian and vegan friendly. The martinis can be a little strong but I like them a lot. The best one is either the mango or the Buddha.  Don't be afraid to ask for more broth either!",

This is the type of place where you have to not be picky and willing to try combos and put a little work into your meal. LOVED it!",

    "text": "Phoenix finally has shabu. Kudos for that. As someone who has been to many shabu restaurants in other states, perhaps my expectations were too high. The food is good for the average diner but not fantastic.  I do like the option of organic grass feed beef, and choice of rice or noodles or both. Except the rice was really dry.   The staff kept forgetting our veggies, rice, noodles, etc. Perhaps the menu was too complicated or too many options for them to handle. Instead, maybe have less options...maybe combine veggie options. The staff needs to work on a rhythm. It's not hard to bring out broth, veggies, carbs and protein. In that order. Bam, done. Once they get that down, service should improve.   I think Shabu Fondue has potential. Those who have never had shabu should definitely try it. Being able to make a reservation was a plus.",

But, the servers all seem to hate their jobs. The big projection screens stayed on the menu page of Netflix for way too long before someone put on a japanamation cartoon. However, my kids and I left because it smelled so bad. Not like fish, how some places do....the smell was permeating from the bathrooms.

After some suggestion from our server, we had the yin yang pot with spicy lemongrass and coconut curry (favorite) broths, organic shabu beef,  shrimp, and a variety of vegetables with udon noodles. Everything was super fresh, the flavors were fantastic and it's a really fun experience overall. Such a great addition to Phoenix and the uptown neighborhood, we will definitely be back!",

But, here's the thing, we arrived early on a Friday evening  (5:30) and had a party of 5.  The place was basically empty.  Rather than seating us at an appropriate table for all of us to fit comfortably, they put us at a 4 top, and then adder a chair to the end aisle.  WHO DOES THAT?? We questioned this, and the manager on duty stated that they \"would get busy\" later and needed the larger tables for 6 or more.  Even though we had a vegetarian with us and wanted 2 pots AND it was her birthday, so we had gifts and other things with us that take up extra room.  He suggested we could use a 2nd booth!!  So, split our party up??  Rather than letting us use the nugget table.     Whatever, we squeezed in the single booth and it was very crowded and unpleasant!  Fondue places come with many dishes!!  And we had everything crammed on this tiny table.    Luckily the drinks were strong and the food somewhat made up for the rudeness of the manager.   By the way, ALL the big tables were still empty when we left.  I was sure glad he saved those BIG tables for those people that never showed up!  Next time maybe they'll cater to the customers who are actually there  and not the ones that may never show up!!",

(I probably will).  Anyway, this place is SO UNDERRATED.  It's in this dinky strip mall, which makes you question your decision.  But don't judge the restaurant by the poorly marked parking lot, you NEED to go in and eat their delicious food.  Get the lemongrass broth.  Don't even worry about the others.  They're not as good.  I've tried them.  Just get the lemongrass.  It's by far the most flavourful and least MSG-y one they have.  Service is also top notch here.  No, the waiters here aren't bubbly, but it doesn't mean they're not good at their jobs.  My peanut sauce never runs dry (v. important), they're constantly adjusting the heat on the pots (also v. important), and they're always very honest with their suggestions.  Portion control is the biggest challenge here, as you don't want to over-order, but you also want to try EVERYTHING.  I have a pretty big appetite and two plates of meat was enough for myself and my boyfriend.    Here are a few things you should definitely try:  - Iced Tofu - when you freeze tofu it turns into little soy sponges and they soak up the broth and sauce oh-so-good.  Make sure you don't overcook!  - Prime Lamb - even if you don't really think you like lamb or have never tried lamb, this is a good start.  Because the lamb is sliced so thinly, it doesn't have that usual gamey lamb taste.  - Enoki Mushrooms - Not super earthy, so great for people who don't really \"like\" mushrooms.  They soak up the peanut sauce really well and have an amazing texture.  - The wagu beef, when they have it - self explanatory.  All in all, always a great experience here.  Worth the trek to central PHX.  Go check it out!",

It is a great way to use up whatever produce you have in the fridge before it goes bad; chop up all the veggies and meat, put it in a boiling pot of water with some ponzu and whatever other seasoning you're in the mood for and you have a simple, economical way to make a healthy meal.  With the high prices I was expecting to have some exotic ingredients... fugu, Kobe beef and/or some extra special sauces or something... nope, we make much better nabe at home. I can imagine that to someone from a non-Asian household who doesn't always have bok choy, 5 different kinds of mushroom and tofu hanging out in the fridge, this feels like a special meal. It is good food. I understand and respect what they are trying to do, but the product doesn't justify the prices.",

He made helpful recommendations and suggestions and frequently checked on us to make sure we were figuring it out.  What didn't at first seem like a lot of food turned out to be plenty (we ordered 9 items).  The shrimp and shitake were my favorites.  It was a neat experience to be able to cook your own food right at the table.  The only CONS were: we were starving!  When we ordered our shabu our waiter suggested we also get some spring rolls from next door as we told him how hungry we were.  It took FOREVER for the spring rolls to come and another forever for our shabu to be served.  Other than that our experience was good and I look forward to going back.",

So we decide to visit this place based on the Yelp reviews.    At first look pulling into the parking lot was not sure & couldn't locate it & had to call.  It's write next to the swimming tots & 99 cent store.  Their sign is a little small and since I haven't been to that area kind of confusing.    But we were greeted & asked which side of the restaurant we wanted.  The hostess was very friendly.  Of course we choose this side.    Their staff is very nice & helpful!  Since this was new we had lots of questions.  They were very know to explain everything to us.    We ordered ribeye, shiitake mushrooms , broccoli, shrimp, white fish rice & egg noodles.   We had the Spicy Lemongrass & coconut curry as our cooking dips.    We loved it all & it was just enough food for me and the hubby!  We will definitely be back with friends!!!!",

We chose spicy lemongrass and coconut curry for our soup base, the two choices were very yummy! We had four orders of shabu beef, two types of tofu, fish cake, enoki mushrooms, and napa cabbage. We could have done without the fish cake, but everything else went really well with the two soup bases. Their peanut dipping sauce is SO GOOD, like really good. I dipped everything in that amazing sauce!!! We also had rice and glass noodles with the dish. They also came by and refilled our soups FOR FREE. Can't wait to come back and try more soups! Only downside was the wait.. they oddly brought out the soup first and our sides came out fifteen minutes later.. wish they could have waited to bring out our soups when everything was ready!",

Everything was fresh and robust with flavor. We ordered two Red Kissed martinis- they were delicious! The servers were very attentive and friendly. The only drawback was the wait: and they did not take call-ahead reservations. But that speaks to the popularity of the place- and the wait was worth it, and we will definitely be coming back soon!

    "text": "Shabu Fondue is one of my favorite places to eat. We have 2 very picky daughters who are not super adventurous when it comes to food, so finding a place that we all love is always a good thing. The yin and yang (2 broth choices) is perfect for us, since we like spicy and they don't. We can put whatever we want in our side, and they can put whatever they want in their side. They love being able to cook the food in their broth, and it keeps them busy through the whole meal (ideal for an overall pleasant dining experience with young kids).   I've seen some other reviews that mention bad service, so I'm going to comment on the service as well. We have not experienced bad service here yet, and I find the servers to be extremely helpful with the menu items when I'm not sure what to order. We also tend to go a little earlier before the place gets busy, so that could also be a contributor to the good service we've had.   All in all, after dining here twice now and having a consistently good experience, this is my new favorite restaurant. I will be back a lot.",

    "text": "Shabu my Fondue!! This place is the tits!!    I had previously been to the Thai restaurant connected before Sabu was finished and abosoltely loved the food so I knew I wanted to come back to try the new concept! My boyfriend and I came here for date night - I was overly excited as I have been dying to try this place - and it did not disappoint.  We were instantly greeted and asked to wait just a moment before being seated as they got our table ready and waters down.  We were given the menu and a run down of how everything works. Can I mention they have SE Asian beer options - I was so freaking happy!!  We ended up ordering the Shabu Steak (I would recommend getting the Wagu), deheaded shrimp, ice tofu (AMAZING- soaked in ice water and this technique allows the tofu to soak up all the flavor of the broth), broccoli, babycorn, watercress, the Enoki (string white mushrooms), baby bokchoy (you get a lot), rice noodles and rice - yes we over ordered and don't care because we were in fat kid heaven. Another visit we have ordered the scallops, lamb, chicken, organic beef - all of which I cannot complain. They were all great flavor and taste.  We did the Ying Yang broth - the House Spice & House Herbal each unique in flavor - you can also get it vegetarian style which is awesome!  My favorite combination is the lemongrass and house spice! Soo good.  It such a fun experience and would recommend to anyone looking for a fun date spot or even a group event (they have a long table down the middle for large parties).  Service, food, atmosphere all exceeded my expectations and cannot wait to go back - probably this weekend.",

    "text": "I discovered shabu when I worked in Sacramento where there are several restaurants serving this style of food, but until now you haven't been able to get it in Phoenix which I why I was thrilled to hear that this location had opened... and close to my house to boot.  For those who've never had it, shabu is an asian style of fondue, sometimes referred to as hot pot. Instead of oil, cheese, or chocolate each table has its own warmer to which they bring you a large bowl of soup broth in which you cook your food. You can even order two types of broth that come in a large container that is split down the middle.  We ordered two, the base, house broth for the kids and a slightly spicier lemongrass broth for us. We then ordered a mix of items to cook including beef, chicken, tofu, broccoli, dumplings, crab, scallops, and noodles. When they bring the items, they tell you how long each one should cook and its helpful to arrange them by cooking time starting with the longest that take 3 to 4 minutes and working down to those that take only a minute or less.  Once you have all of your food, the fun begins. My kids had a blast deciding what to try, cooking their own food, and eating with chopsticks.  Service was excellent, our server stopped by several times to see how we were doing and to adjust the heat on our hot plate. The manager (owner?) stopped by a few times as well to make sure we were having a good time and we assured him that we definitely were.  The atmosphere was fun as well. It's decorated sort of like a club and they were playing a great mix of tunes, including stuff that we used to go out dancing to in the 80s and 90s... definitely a Bright Lights, Big City type of place. The manager even mentioned that they have a DJ in the Thai restaurant next door on Friday and Saturday nights.  While we had a great time as a family, this would also be a blast for an adult night out on the town. If you've never had shabu, or you've been missing it in Phoenix, you definitely want to head on out to Shabu Fondue for an enjoyable time!",

Lets talk about what went terribly wrong with our dinning experience- The scallops were brought to the table frozen in a bowl so they needed to be chiseled apart.  The shrimp was also frozen.   The worst part was the seafood items were extremely fishy.  :(  YUCK! = cheap fish!   Now lets talk about the vegetables.  The broccoli was brown on the stems an the florets were wilted.  The taste was flavorless.  Based on appearance, the broccoli had been sitting in the back of the refrigerator for at least a week.  Vegetables SHOULD BE FRESH!    Based on the food quality I'm appalled this place charges so much.   Service was a 3 out of 5 as we had to ask staff to take our empty bowls that once contained the semi frozen raw meats away.    I don't enjoy writing negative reviews but I felt it was important to let any foodie know this place has low standards and the quality is absent so spend your money else where.",

I only have one complaint, start me off with more of the two sauces you all provide, filling up that little cup half way isn't doing any one any favors.

If you ever hear that Chinese food is different in China, that is mostly True when it comes to your American Chinese type take-out, but hot pot is definitely a very traditional dining experience in China. You start off by choosing your sides, for those new to this start with basic beefs and chicken and work through your veggies and pastas.   You will need to pick your broth and this is can make or break your dinning experience.  If possible I would try their broth to see what you like best and if you are into hot food definitely go with their spicy soup.   Be sure to ask questions to their staff to ensure you order correct, they speak English, our last place in LA was epic but nobody spoke English so we had to learn through our visits.   Overall very excited to see Shabu in town and this place is well done with some good drinks, definitely a great date night for those who are exploring new things.",

Recommend, kobe beef, fried/soft tofu, nappa, regular beef, shiitake mushroom, and clams.   Broth: house special and the coconut one  Avoid: mussels, shrimp, and clams  Service took for ever because of poor staffing  It is way over priced, I was eating with 4 other people and we split the check, the total came out to be 42$ a person..",

The mala spicy broth is excellent to cook the meats in. Definitely a place to try! The service is always amazing and they are always very accommodating.",

    "text": "Worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I just walked out.  Friday night my Girl friend and I decided to try this place out. We waited 15 mins to be seated, took only a few mins to order the food. Keep in mind the food is raw, you have to cook it in a hot pot. 30 mins go by the servers don't even acknowledge the wait time. I'm sitting there with a boiling pot waiting for my meats and veggies. This is raw frozen food people you cook your self at your table.  I can't even get I'm sorry for the wait or even an eye contact. I just decided to walk out of the place. Close to an hour from putting my name on the list to getting nothing done but sit at the table. Watching water bubble and boil. Johnny Chu I hope you're reading this.",

    "text": "Lots of options. Flavors were all very good from what we had. Did seem to rack up in price a little more than we thought. The prime lamb and shrimp with heads off were a great choice. Mushrooms are good, not great. Broccoli and noodles were a good choice. For two people we got 7 options and that was more than enough. Next time I think we would get 5 if not overly hungry, 6 if more hungry.",
