The battered choice was my favorite though because the crust on the fish was on point. Just the right amount of salt and it was crunchy not soggy. The guy at the front was also very polite and was full of information. I will definitely be coming back here to try the other tacos but most likely probably won't be topping up that battered fish taco!",

We ordered several different kinds of tacos and they were all delicious. The meats are smoked onsite and we loved each one we tried. The salsas were delicious as well. My husband has several food allergies and the server was very accommodating. We went next door and grabbed a dry Crispin Ale to eat with our food.  The owner was quite friendly in both the restaurant and the adjoining liquor store. There is no fee to bring a beverage over to the restaurant from the liquor store next door. The service was good and the owner chatted with us both in the restaurant and in the adjoining liquor store. We can't wait to go back.",

I  was THE only customer in the place and it took over 25 minutes to get my soup.  The beans didn't make it to the table.  No explanation,  apology, or anything.  By the time the bowl got to the table it may have had about 1/2 cup of menudo in it for $7.99 (note the size of the spoon next to the little bowl in my photo).   I  have been here for menudo in the past and the bowl was 2 or 3 times bigger.  The kid behind the counter said \"well maybe I could reduce the price for you\".  All I wanted was enough soup for a meal.  I could see the 2 cooks in the back just having a great time conversing without a care in the world.  The kid behind the counter seemed to be most interested in finding something on the TV that he was interested in watching.  Needless to say, I just walked out.",

    "text": "Staff: Friendly and quirky. You can tell they care a lot about the food and check in several times to make sure everything is up to par. Might be overbearing for some food enjoyers. They are a few months in and are working to develop their brand.   Food: Salsas are homemade and you get various options a la carte and free. Spanish Rice was flavorful but a tad too fluffy and overcooked. I don't think the rice was extra long grain which is what I believe most Mexican dishes use . Meat options were plentiful and tasty. I'd say their meat is the strongest item in terms of flavor on the menu.   Drinks: They do have horchata but it's in a big glass server and not machine so it's not getting consistently stirred and the alcohol is literally BYOB (there's a liquor store right next door). Kinda fun and they have ice buckets and frozen glasses for you.  I would definitely come back in. This is the type of restaurant that seems to go the extra mile to get to know you and find out how they can continue developing their food!",

Their dry and bland burritos lacked fresh authentic ingredients and were replaced by an excess of what tasted like unseasoned beans straight out of the can. The disappointingly small portions of rice and beans would have usually bothered me but after one bite the rest ended up in the trash anyway.   The service was terrible- and we got it to go... They confused our order, couldn't remember which burrito was which, and while we were waiting, we couldn't help but notice how dirty the silverware was on their appropriate abundance of unoccupied dining tables.   A must skip restaurant in a market that's  abundant with stellar Mexican food in every neighborhood.",

Friendly server promptly took our order, but it took a long time for our order to come. The beans were cold and had to be returned and heated up. Took a long time to get them back. Turns out my frijoles lacked flavor - - maybe not enough salt. My pork burrito also lacked much spice. I asked for red medium salsa and got mild. I returned it and was given medium GREEN salsa. I just let it go. I took half the burrito home (large enough portion), and I'm going to have to load it up with my own salsa. Maybe we got the second string weekend crew. I may go back and give them a second chance.",

The restaurant is small and  charming, but the prices for the  street fast food you get  Is way too expensive.

On the expensive side though - I didn't see an itemized bill, so I'm not sure if I paid extra for guacamole on the vegetarian taco salad, and then extra again for friend peppers? The guacamole appetizer is over $7 and comes with a very small dish of guacamole, with a large plate of chips. At the end, I let the kids have deep fried ice cream, which seemed like deep friend corn flakes on the ice cream - not what I'm used to from having a dessert like that in the past. I had asked how big the ice cream dish was, and she made it seem small. So I ordered one for all 4 of us... definitely was too much - we could have easily order 2 to share. I wanted to love it, but our meals were \"meh\" - especially for the sucker punching bill at the end... over $50 for me and my kids. I figured around $40.

If I could change one small thing about it, it would only be to have more of it for the price.  Since we were at a taco place, we each ordered one taco with the intention of giving each other a lil' sample bite. I got the chorizo and he got the al pastor. Both were incredible! Bear in mind that these are small street-style tacos, so if you are really hungry, order a few. We will be back.",

It was a huge burrito and every bite had a good balance of meat to egg. My husband had the chorizo breakfast platter which was a hearty portion that he enjoyed. The horchata was decent, but too sweet for me.   There is a great salsa bar with various salsas, limes, and pickled jalapenos. It's covered as well which I appreciate since it keeps things more hygienic.  The only real negative was that there isn't a soda fountain so all drinks are by the bottle or in a large glass container for aguas frescas. The sodas are only Jarritos brand, which I believe has no diet soda option.   Overall though, I'll definitely come here again for more tasty and quick options for Mexican food.",

There were 2 guys behind the counter and they both eagerly greeted us before the front door had finished closing. OK, getting better.  They asked if it was dine in or carry out. We said dine in and were offered the pick of any table.  One of the guys brought waters immediately after we sat down. And a few minutes after that the other guy came over to answer questions and take our orders.  We started with chips and guacamole. The chips were warm and crisp and a hint of lime; kind of like Chipotle's but not as bitter or overpowering. The guac was smooth and creamy. We liked both.  For tacos we tried the Al Pastor, barbacoa and carne asada. All were pretty good and uniquely spiced and flavored. My only complaint is the amount of lettuce piled on top. We had to scrape a good portion of it off. The tacos are good and don't need to be buried under a mountain of filler.  We also sampled several salsas from the salsa and found them to be most excellent. Salsa bar is on point.  We were pleasantly surprised at the food and service we received at TC TACO. I really hope this place makes it because it deserves to.",

    "text": "I've been here twice in the past week, so you know the food has to be pretty good!  First time I went, I got the steak burrito dinner.  It came with a burrito, rice, and beans for about $9.  Not a bad deal... except when you realize that the burrito alone is only about $6... and the rice and beans they serve in the \"dinner\" are not that great-tasting.  The rice especially was not my favorite.  So second time I went, I just ordered the al pastor burrito alone.  Out of the two meats I tried, I think I prefer the steak to the pork.  I really like the \"smokey spicy\" salsa in their salsa bar.  It's not that hot, but it adds nice flavor to the burritos.  I overheard them saying that they got their recipes from Mexico City, so I guess they're pretty authentic to True \"street\" tacos!  This place is great, although I'll try to limit my visits in the future since the food isn't really all THAT healthy for you :P",

I got the 3 taco plate (Bistec, Al Pastor, and Barbacoa). My favorite was the Al Pastor but all 3 were tender and delicious. I was sad to see that it wasn't busy at lunch. This place is worth trying! I give 4 stars instead of 5 because the sign says that the chips are made fresh to order but when they arrived, they were not hot or even warm.

I go back at least once a week, just to say hello, and get some of the \"good stuff\" which happens to be everything on the menu. couldn't have asked for a more friendly laid back atmosphere, where you can BYOB.  liquor store right next door makes it convenient. you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, so extra trips are mandatory. start with the chips and fresh made guac, try all the salsas because they all have very different tastes, that will leave you guessing, and sometimes sweating. as far as the meats are concerned YOU WILL NOT GET ANY FRESHER SMOKED MEATS THAN THIS PLACE. the one time the smoker went down, I almost cried. Never thought i would enjoy mexican food  as much as i do but the smoked meats really put it into a different class. Class Act with a great staff. Adam C.  aka \"Soup Campbell\"",

The rice and beans were tasty but my tacos were nothing special at all. They weren't even served with cilantro or onion(a taco necessity), instead it was sprinkled with some old brown lettuce and diced tomatoes. Also each taco came to be three dollars which is pretty expensive for the type and quality of the little tacos. I won't be coming back.",

We ordered the taco dinner plate, with two carne asada and 1 pastor taco. I liked how the pastor had small pieces of pineapple. Yum. For the price of the plate, there was not that much meat in my tacos. The Carne asada marinade was good, but the meat was ok. In summary, I probably wouldn't come here again, but it wasn't terrible. The customer service was great, and they had three different salsas to choose from. Mild, medium or spicy. Medium salsa was pretty tasty.",

I also read the reviews before I  came in hoping to try their so-called best menudo in town. Guess what? They're not serving menudo on the day i came in? At least that's what I was told by our server.....LAME. come on this is AZ..If you're going to do Mexican food and claim it's Authentic. Then do it right or don't do it at all there's too much competition out here I mean honestly I would rather hit a Filiberto's then TC. And to top it off there was hair in the food",

Don't be fooled by the high overall rating - I read in another recent review this place has new owners and things have gone downhill. My experience today was terrible. Carne asada meat was chewy and obviously low quality plus it was super sparse in the items I ordered (burrito and large quesadilla). I paid extra for onions and jalapenos in the quesadilla and it was still flavorless, I can't imagine how lame it would have been if I hadn't added these items. I added a photo of the worst item, the carnitas taco - four big chunks of fat and three tiny pieces of meat with hardly any garnish. Total waste of $23. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away.",

Attached to a liquor store, you certainly feel the urge to pick up an icy Dos Equis to accompany your food (even if it is 10am on a Monday.) The salsa is amazing, dont miss the arbol and jalapeno/avocado.",

For those that critique the price, this isn't a careta (taco cart) this place is a classy business with a culinary focus, for that, I am happy to pay the price that it is worth. Mexican food is a culinary art/tradition that often goes under-appreciated by those looking for cheap cheap.",

    "text": "Second time eating here. Burrito is not that big, in fact it's the smallest of anywhere I have eaten. But ok, who cares if it's giant if it tastes awful right. Here is the problem, one time I go and get burrito and it cost $6 and change. Cool right? That even cancels out the small size. Then I go back and I'm charged $10 and change!!!!!! Really???? That's all I got mind you, a burrito......to go......same kind as before with exact same toppings, carne asada.  So when things like that happen, I'm not about to argue what their prices are (menu says $6.85) I'm just going to pay them and never come back. Maybe they just make up the prices as they go along. Say what you want about filibertos, but it's a good size burrito and every time I go it's $8.30. 7:00 am at Broadway.......$8.30 10:00pm at Elliott.........$8.30. Unless your putting filet minon in the burrito I'm not sure how it cost almost $11!!!!!! I wanted to make them my regular spot, stick with filibertos.",

I can taste the metal taste of the canned beans, I asked young man is it real Mexican cheese on beans? He responded with, yes it's real! The cheese is yellow and white blend.  salsas average, rice pilaf for arroz. It just tasted like Gil's in North Phoenix New Mexican - fake Mexican.The tacos we're sub-par, oversalted and the tacos al pastor was pork dipped in a sauce. Not real tacos al pastor.  Fish tacos were  minnow tacos, I went on a 3 hour tour like Gilligan and The Skipper and never found the fish. Chips were nice and hot, guacamole saved the day. My tummy is hurting and only Mexican item I ate/drank was the Coke. I left plate barely touched. I was disappointed  by this place. Oh and the beef was tough and had adobo sauce. Nice try but I will stick to real Mexican places I know, server was overwhelmed but very polite.",

They smoke their own meats and my fiance and roommate got their smoked chicken and al pastor tacos for the taco Tuesday special.  They said both were delicious.  I tried the al pastor and found it yummy as well.  I also tried the chorizo taco, but it wasn't anything special.  The guy who served us (I think he is the owner) was super friendly, helpful, and attentive.  This place has BYOB and there is a drive through (kinda sketchy) liquor store next door.  The taco Tuesday special was for 3 street tacos, and it only ran my fiance just over $4.00!  The chips are made to order and my fiance who isn't a big chip person couldn't stop eating them!  I can't wait to go back and try the carne asada and fried shrimp tacos that many others have praised in their reviews!  Definitely check this place out!",

The place just opened up last Wednesday. The decor is simple. They basically took over the Chinese place that was there, added some Mexican flair, and called it good. Fine by me.  I got the 3 taco dinner plate. They have at least a dozen taco options. The nice girl working behind the counter recommended the marinated chicken. I went ahead and got one of those, a carne asada taco, and a pork taco (can't remember which one). It came with rice and beans, a couple roasted peppers which were nice and spicy, shredded cabbage, and sliced radishes.  All three tacos were great. I added a little guacamole and homemade salsa from the salsa bar.  I'll definitely be back again. I'm so glad a good taco shop opened up in the neighborhood.",

Staff was super friendly and helpful when choosing our food.  My son ordered the barbacoa beef burrito, I ordered the in-house smoked chicken burrito, and we swapped burrito halves.    My favorite was the barbacoa, so tender and not stringy at all, full of flavor with just a hint of sweet.  The burrito had just the right amounts of fluffy seasoned rice, crunchy onions, fresh cilantro, cubes of tomato, creamy melty cheese, all wrapped up in a soft yet flaky tortilla.  It was gone before I knew what hit me.  Chicken burrito was delicious also but a little milder in flavor than the barbacoa.  Moist chicken had a yummy grilled flavor that mixed beautifully with the other ingredients so each bite held *all* the flavors.  Outstanding flavors, really hit the spot for both of us.  Can't wait to go back and start working our way through the rest of the menu!",

Their meat is super tender and delicious, can't go wrong with the chicken! I'm a huge fan of the taco salad, but the burrito and tacos are prime time.   My husband fav part is the BYOB and liquor store next door. The perfect combo, especially for taco Tuesday.",

We came back exactly 30 minutes later and our order was not only not finished, it hadn't even been made by the kitchen yet. The lady at the register was apologetic and was nice enough to refund our order. But it was still not a great first experience.",

The women at the front counter didnt take my order she was trying to save me for the person coming in to switch shifts with her. Then was being rude to him because he wouldnt give her his numbers because it was against the rules and then she wanted him to hurry up and count his drawer. And then he was saying that she could have taken my order when he first got there and basically they were arguing over everything.  You could tell there was some tension between them but I felt arkward even being around that. Especially when they started talking about my order. Sounded like he was just trying to follow the rules and she was upset about it. Dont know if ill come back.  The food was really good but the arkwardness made it all not worth it",

The food here is actually of GREAT quality! If I'm honest to myself, probably better than most other places I frequent. It's just so dead inside that when craving atmosphere as well as good food this place doesnt come to mind which is why I give 4 out of 5.   They have many salsas to choose from, I like them all. They serve menudo which is very clean and not all grisly like at some places, however I find the bowl (serving ) to be small as compared to other places. Then again it is quality over quantity here in pretty much all circumstances.  The Shrimp and fish here are excellent. The rice is however a little boring.  The only item here I am not a fan of sadly is their chips. I dont like the size , texture, or taste.   Overall, great for carryout or dine in if you like the sound of crickets.",

I even reconfirmed the no onions order when I came in and realized it had not been made yet. They also got my other plate wrong giving 3 carne asada tacos when I had ordered 3 different kinds of tacos. The tacos were only so/so, feel like I could have got the same thing at Filiberto's for less money and at least they could get my order right. This was not a case of being to busy either. When I walked in there was only one table and they had not even ordered yet.

I saw a few recent, bad reviews and one mentioned a change in ownership so I thought I'd visit them again to see what the hubbub was all about. I ordered the three taco plate with two fish and one Al pastor for pick up. When I got there the first thing that I noticed was a sign on the door that stated \"BYOB is back.\" BYOB was one of the things that made TC Taco stand out to me, someone told me the person who owned the liquor store next door also owned the TC Taco, so that kind of made me think the new owner thing was True. Once I stepped inside I was pretty sure it was now under new ownership, the inside has been redone and the salsa bar is gone, I also noticed the usual aroma wasn't as strong either. When I visited in the past I could smell the different kinds of meat cooking. Anyway, I got my tacos and I immediately noticed the tortillas were a little different, not bad, just different. The Al pastor taco, however, was not as I remember it. It was not as tender and juicy, the pieces of meat seemed to be a different cut as well or prepared differently, it was ok, but not as good as it used to be. It was also lacking in spiciness, before I could barely eat two Al pastor tacos. The fish tacos we're still good and it seems they even have bigger pieces of fish in them, so that was a nice surprise. I will probably still get tacos here, but not as much as I used to, previously I would have given this place four stars.",

    "text": "If you live in Tempe near the US 60 on Mill ave or nearby, and have never been impressed by authentic Mexican street tacos, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try. It is very special.  This little joint sits in a strip mall corner unit complete with a picture window that provides breathtaking views of a drive-thru liquor store. It is one of many local businesses alongside a 24 hour fitness club next to a pizza place. Unassuming and uncomplicated come to mind. The service is friendly and prompt. Glass bottled cane sugar sodas with Spanish language labels are kept ice cold in a retro-chic skinny coke machine behind the counter. Large jars of tea and aguas frescas (horchata and jamaica on my last visit) gently sweat away on the counter, all of it kept very clean. The menu board lists prices that compete with any of the ubiquitous yellow-sign 'Anybertos' that sum up the majority of authentic Mexican quick service fare in the Phoenix metro area.  That earns 3 stars. Why the other 2? This was quite simply one of the best meals I have ever eaten anywhere. They know their food is good, but allow it to speak for itself rather than boasting about how great it is.  Nearly everything is made in house, often from scratch, and ingredient not made there is carefully selected to reflect the same levels quality and authenticity (i.e. they only use Mexican cheese). The meats are all either grilled or smoked, and present a wide range of texture from chewy, crispy, crunchy, to tender, often in the same bite (best Al Pastor I've had ANYWHERE). While the meats are surprisingly light and non-greasy without being dry, this is probably not the best place for a diet, or a vegetarian.  I ordered a 3-taco dinner with Carne Asada, Pollo Adobado, and Al Pastor. The Carne Asada was fantastic, as good as any I've ever had. The Adobado and Al Pastor tacos immediately triggered that 'perfect bite' reflex; that moment where you just stop mid chew and slow down and savor every little detail, because your tastebuds are telling you you've found some of that really REALLY good stuff. The beans and rice seemed to be made with equal attention to detail. The refried beans were the most flavorful I've ever had. Not sure if they were using lard, but I could swear there was a faint cheese-like tang in there beyond the cheese melted on top.  I will be going back for dinner tomorrow. And probably the next night until I can try everything on the menu.  Pros: INCREDIBLE food from traditional recipes, great value, unpretentious and universally welcoming. BYOB and there's a liquor store with excellent beer/wine next door.  Cons: Sooner or later this place is going to get a visit and recommendation from a celebrity chef, and it will have a line. I wish they were open later.",

We come here at least twice a month, everything I've had is delicious but my favorite has got to be the smoked chicken. The salsa bar is also very good! I like that they keep it chilled in a covered cooler but you might miss it if you aren't looking for it. All of the salsa tastes very fresh.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying, we have often entered restaurants near to closing time and have always been \"warned\" by the staff that closing time was approaching and have even been turned away on a few occasions. That was absolutely NOT the case at TC Tacos. We arrived at 8:30 on a Sunday night. We were welcomed to \"dine-in\" without hesitation even though they were scheduled to close at 9pm. The owner greeted us and made us feel comfortable to take our time ordering and eating. To me this was even more important than the food. The exceptional food was just a bonus at this point. Not surprising though. It was very clear that the owner took a lot of pride in his food and his goal is his customers enjoying their food and experience in his restaurant. Our group of five had a variety of burritos and tacos and we all left with very happy bellies!  We will definitely be regular customers whenever we're in the Tempe area.",

Authentic, house-smoked meats, fresh salsa bar and very friendly service. I'm definitely gonna be going there again and again after this experience. I tried 2 of each type of meat for their street tacos and each one was unique, high-quality, and DELICIOUS. My two favorites were the smoked chicken and the carne asada, however the carnitas and barbacoa were amazing as well. Depending on what I'm in the mood for I can imagine ordering any one of them again. If you want the authentic real deal you've got to check this place out! :D",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, I've kinda gotten burnt out over the hype of corporate Mexican food. So I'm slowly checking out local one-off Mexican restaurants and TC just happened to be in the same plaza of my new gym. Convenient.   Ordering was confusing. Do we order at the counter and sit down, or was TC going for a full service experience? I was let down to know that their version of carnitas was sold out for the day, a few minutes after I ordered it. Service was staggered, my friend received rice and beans a good 15 minutes before his tacos. I got my 4 tacos 12 minutes before he got his. To make up for this I was expecting the back of the house to maybe hook us up portion wise. Sadly we were skimped pretty bad on the taco filling. I know, these are under $2 but I wish I had ordered 5-7 tacos to get full rather than 4.   I have so much respect for such a varied salsa bar. I honestly had a fun time killing the longer then normal wait time by taking shots of the concoctions. A wide variety of peppers were represented as well as all the limes you need. A bright orange sauce seemed to be my favorite with lots of heat; an avocado and tomatillo salsa had heaps of cilantro that proved to go well with the tender al pastor. A few more morsels of meat would have gone a long way. The flavor is clearly there at TC but it appears they are a bit  too understaffed to provide a smooth dine-in right now. I will probably give them another try when they iron out the kinks because the way they handled their protein was admirable. Nothing was fatty and nothing was overcooked. With the local Filibertos serving speedy hot fire, TC has some catching up to do.",

I thought the beans were a bit too thick and the rice was about 2 more minutes from smelling spoiled :(   I also docked a star since I also had to wait about 20 minutes and they weren't busy at all.

However, it felt like they were offering me chips and salsa after I paid up front, but before I left they handed me another check for $3. $3 for a small thing of chips and salsa?

    "text": "My wife and I came in around 8:15 on a Wednesday night and we weren't sure if it was open. Unfortunately for us, it was...The place seemed nice, but it wasn't even remotely an authentic experience. We got street tacos to go and chorizo and egg plate to go. The two ladies working were fantastic and very nice. I asked them what does TC stand for and they said \"Tempe City\", which is never a good start. The salsa were fairly good and the service was pleasant, but quite frankly that doesn't matter in the slightest when the food was so dang bad. The chorizo and eggs were chunky and not mixed (though that's really chef preference), it came with a tortilla on the side--hard to really screw it up (was ok). The tacos were awful...We got three. Carne Asada, Carnitas, and chicken of some sorts (can't remember if it was pollo asado or not). But they were all under seasoned and over cooked. As someone that works in the service industry, consistency of food is very challenging particularly when it's very slow or very busy. But my wife is obsessed with tacos and she looked like she was going to cry in disappointment from how bad they were. Normally even bad tacos are still better than no tacos.  It was bad enough that we aren't even going to consider another try (which is pretty much almost always worth doing). I put off writing a review because the two people were so nice in the store, but the fact that this place came up in the top yelp search I just did of restaurants in Tempe is pretty alarming. Save yourself a so-so experience and go to a consistently tasty place (our fav as least near Tempe is Los Taquitos).  So sad...",

We also had the salsa which was decent. The chips though we're great. It was my first time here so I ordered five different tacos. They are corn tortilla street tacos of decent size. 3 inches in diameter about.   I had the carne asada, chorizo, El pastor, carnitas, and barbacoa. They were all different and very flavorful. As this is made to order, it was hot, fresh, and full of flavor. The only recommendation I would give is to make this more of a traditional restaurant with a True server. we felt bad for her as she was the busser, the server, the host, and the cashier all at once. It would go a long way also to have like a chip and salsa bar or something fun to keep people occupied.",

I was recently asked to put together my neice's wedding for 40 people with a VERY limited budget. I worked with Corey, the owner of TC Tacos, and he put developed an amazing spread that not only met my budget but also had the guests raving about the wonderful food.   For catered events, TC Tacos prices the tacos by the (cooked) pound and that price includes ALL the fixings. We had the chicken, al pastor, and carne asada - all perfectly prepared, tender, and spiced to perfection. We also wanted some finger foods for the buffet and he put together an assortment of rolled quesadillas, mini crunchy tacos, and little 2-3 bite shrimp ceviches. And of course, we had to have his famous guacamole - lots of it! And don't forget the salsas. We had all 5 to choose from - the range was delightfully mild to deliciously hot and spicey. Corey provided a quantity of food that not only accomodated my budget and our guests appetites, but allowed them to come back for seconds and thirds!  Corey is very profession but easy going and a pleasure to work with. He provided an elegant and tasty buffet in a skilled and efficient manner the day of the wedding. He was as determined as I was to make this a successful and memorable wedding.  If you are looking for delicious Mexican cuisine at affordable prices for either a quick meal or a catered event, TC Tacos is the place to go!",

This restaurant is a small, sit-down place with a cozy feel and cute decor. Workers are very nice and accommodating. We started off by ordering an horchata and chips and salsa, and both were fabulous which is how we knew we found a good food joint. Horchata is a little sweet but lacks nothing in flavor, as it also has a very nice creamy consistency. The salsa is my favorite though with a slight smoky undertone from the chiles used and medium heat level. They also have a salsa bar with the works back by the counter, and all of them were good, honestly.  Taco meat is usually smoked according to the menu, and my sister and I sampled almost all of them with the grilled fish and chicken being the favorite. I even added a grilled jalapeno to mine for an extra kick.   Prices are very reasonable, and even though the tacos seem smaller, we left ready to explode after everything. This is definitely a place I wish was closer to my house but if you're in the area, hit 'em up for some awesome tacos!",

This place is all about tacos but it serves a wonderful full flare of dinner plates like Chili Rellenos,Pollo Adobado,Fajitas,Mojarra Frits!

    "text": "Tempe City Tacos is absolutely my new go-to taco joint; I don't know how I lived down the street for a couple years before finding it. The most important thing you need to know: every Tuesday they feature a different, special taco for $1.50 a pop. Doesn't get much better than that, folks. They're always a taco that isn't on their regular menu--both a blessing and a curse!   I almost exclusively eat here in Tuesday's (usually takeout, which seems to be what accounts for most of their clientele), because I'm a real sucker for a deal. I like to try whatever they have going on for the special, and then get a couple of their normals too. The carne asada here is great, wonderfully marinated, and not at all tough. The smoked chicken is also fantastic, as is their al pastor. I want to love the shrimp and battered fish, but I'm just way too big of a spicy-food wimp for the arbol salsa that they put on it... and it's just not the same without. Oh, the plight! But for spicy food fans, I'd definitely recommend.   I love their avocado jalapeno salsa, and always love a good tomatillo salsa. The roasted red is also a really good standard mild base salsa. I love their guacamole; it's always super fresh and delicious, with a good amount of lime in there. They boyf and I almost always get the chips, salsa, and guac to start, because we love both dips and the homemade chips are great too.   A super low key hole in the wall joint, don't expect anything too fancy. But DO expect impeccable food and ultra friendly service. Every employee has always been super nice and helpful with any questions or in my case, my inability to make food decisions.   I've very quickly become a regular, and definitely don't see that stopping any time soon!",

So I really came here for the Tacos as I'm always on the hunt for classic street tacos.   I hear Taco Tuesday's are the day to come when it's only $1.50 each so I know where a future Tuesday dinner will be. We came in on a Saturday night and it was pretty quiet. The TV was on with Sports Center and plenty of art on the walls to make sure you didn't have any awkward silence   I decided to go with the 3 Taco Dinner that comes with Rice & Beans. Got a Carne Asada, Al Pastor, and fried Fish. My buddy got 2 Carne Asada and the fish, but grilled. The Al Pastor through my taste buds for a double-take as it has Pineapple in its. Very good. Asada was on point with Cilantro & onions and we made sure to get Avocado Jalapeno, tomatillo, and 1 Salsa Roja (HOT) salsas. They come in a little to-go container but you get 2 (no extra charge).  The only thing preventing the 5-star rating was the wait. It wasn't busy, and I get that it's cooked to order, but it took way longer than expected on a not so busy evening. We did order chips, guac and salsa (a bit $$, for the portion, but really good... and chunky) and the chips we were told were being made fresh (no complaints)  Great food and overall good value. Used a Yelp Checkin for the free Horchata and the double bonus of Groupon cashback show up so a win-win.",

Beans and rice are bland but tolerable with tasty salsa!  I've had the pleasure of going once when it was nearly empty inside and received attentive, helpful, and timely service. It was a fantastic experience!   Today, not so fantastic. There was one big table and a few parties of two. The staff were so clearly overwhelmed as evidenced by their behaviors and statements. I can't judge what's difficult and what's not since I've never worked in food service, but I KNOW when you work in a taco restaurant you know the difference between your salsas if you have any experience there. I have no idea what I got and neither did the staff. The other tables around me were asking multiple times for the parts of their orders that were missing.   The icing on the cake was listening to the woman at the counter yell at someone on the phone who called to ask what the special of the day was. That is not an ok way to talk to people, especially in front of others! Sooo cringey....  I give TC Taco three stars cause at their best they're amazing! But under any bit of pressure the whole operation appears to crumble and that doesn't make for a great dining experience.",

Each Tuesday, they have a Chef's special for $1.50 and this week it was a green chile chicken. The cashier was welcoming and helpful since it was my first time dining here. I sat in a booth and perused the menu and decided to get one of the chef's specials, shrimp taco and a veggie taco. I also got a horchata but didn't read the fine print that it was free with a $10 purchase, oops.  My food came out fairly quick and they looked good. I made sure to get some salsa and got the spicy red salsa; it was deceiving because it didn't taste hot initially but the more I ate it, the hotter it got. Nice. Out of the three, I really only liked the veggie taco, the shrimp wasn't very grilled and I didn't care for the chicken. The horchata was too sweet and didn't have the traditional flavors I anticipate, like cinnamon, nutmeg. I did like the vibe of this place and there was a good amount of folks dining in. Service was excellent and personable. I wasn't sure if it was the drink or the tacos, but my stomach became upset later that evening so I will give it time before I come back.",

    "text": "Regrettably, TC Tacos didn't pay attention to our Door Dash instructions for salsa. Our order was for 1 large Barbacoa burrito, 2 fish tacos, 2 al Pastor tacos, and 1 chicken taco. So we bought $20 worth of food and just wanted it augmented with the right amount of salsa. On Door Dash they asked what type of salsa we wanted for our large burrito; we indicated the green avocado/jalapeno salsa. They gave us ONE small green salsa for the large burrito (and at the bottom we also asked, please, some extra, just to make sure this wouldn't happen). They gave us ONE small green salsa for the two al Pastor tacos (that's pretty stingy, and we bought $20 worth of food, oh and we also again asked for extra green salsa, please). But whoever put the order together at the end did not read our request at all. Why do this to a customer you could have pleased? I wish they would get it together here....",

The don't grill up 10 lb meat till you order your taco. The make it fresh when you order it. Make sure to give this place a try, it will be your go to spot!

They're extremely friendly and the food does take a little longer than other places, but it is incredibly fresh. Also a little bit pricier than some other places for the street tacos, but I don't know if I would go anywhere else for quality, authentic Mexican food.  They own the drive-through liquor store next door so you can buy a beer and take it back in. I think too many people are used to calling Tex-Mex Mexican food, and this place is much more authentic. I think once more people give it a try, it will be considered one of the best in town. Definitely try the al pastor tacos!",

I like the three salsas they gave me with my street taco plate. The rice and beans don't qualify as authentic in my book. I have made better tasting beans with salt pepper onion and garlic. So I'm confused why they tasted so bland. The rice is just gross.   Nothing wrong with the tacos or salsa. I had a sweet young server who took care of me well. That probably saved the meal.  When I was eating here it dawned on me that Tempe doesn't have good Mexican food anymore. It kind of made me said that this place is one of the better options.   The Mexican restaurants in Tempe lack any passion or love for what they do.",

They offer burritos, salads, street tacos, quesadillas with your choice of meat & of course they offer fresh dips and avocados. We ordered 4 street tacos (barbacoa, grilled shrimp, chicken & carne asada) along with a small chicken quesadilla. They were so so so so good! I loved the chicken. It is very flavorful!  We also got an horchata which was delish!.....to say the least. We went with the tomatillo dip & avocado jalapeno. Let me say, the avocado jalapeno dip was to die for! So yummy yet not super hot, it was just perfect! The gentleman who helped us was so nice & made sure we enjoyed our visit! We will DEFINITELY BE BACK!!",

I can only give the street tacos a 3. I love that there is a good choice selection, chorizo, carnitas, shrimp and more, however the meats lacked flavor. They were also cooked well; just needs a little seasoning.  I took advantage of the free horchata with check-in. It was good, but didn't have the homemade taste that I'm used to. It lacked flavor as well.  The menu items are priced low. They offer $1.50 tacos on Tuesday.",

I was hungry for dinner and i clicked on my Yelp app and this place had great reviews and had what i wanted, which at the moment was tacos!  The really unique thing about this place is that all the meats are cooked in a smoker which adds an added layer of flavor to your typical taco meat.   I asked for the 3 taco special which included rice and beans.  I had smoked chicken, smoked pork and smoked beef.  they were all pretty good!  The salsa bar is one of things you need to try. The salsa that stands out is an orange colored salsa that has some bite, and tastes like nothing I've had before.I'ts good, you need to get some. . The other salsas were also very good and I'll have to go back and try some different ones.   They have a good selection of meat, pretty much anything you want and many items on the menu that I have yet to check out,   Overall this is a great spot with people that care about the food they make. I'll be back for more",

The fish was crispy and had good flavor, but again, too spicy for me. Overall was good, but was a bit expensive. Probably wouldn't come back.

It's a real shame, I use to really enjoy this place....  ------------  Walking into TC Tacos I was immediately excited by the discovery of what all Yelpers hold dear, the \"whole-in-the-wall\". On arrival, I was greeted by Eddie, who was very welcoming and suggested that we explore their chicken tacos.   Receiving the food, I would say I was satisfied but not ecstatic. With that said, they have a modest yet delicious salsa bar.",

It had this nice smoky flavor about it....yum!  The BF orders huevos rancheros. I order the 3 taco dinner with a variety of meats: barbacoa, smoked chicken, and all pastor (I think that's the name). The food was excellent . Of the three tacos, I have to say the barbacoa taco was my favorite. The man who greeted us recommended a salsa for each of the tacos.   We left very full.

I had the smoked pork street tacos, which although look small, are insanely filling and good. They also have a homemade salsa bar which was a great selection of flavors and levels of spice.

I said something to the young lady who worked there that day and nothing was done. Anyways I went back there to give a second chance an ordered something else to see if it was just a first time mistake which we all know happens. So I ordered fish tacos and a burrito on a lunch visit to go. Well being in a hurry got me a dry taco with nothing on it an then overcharged on my receipt as well. I called back an the girl somehow knew what I was talking about automatically an said to stop back by to grab what she had overcharged me. About $3 overcharged an I only ordered $10 worth of stuff. So if I hadn't noticed they would've made off with some extra dough. Overall if you can go elsewhere do so but if you choose to be careful of what's being ordered an what's being charged. Take care an I hope this helps also.",

Maybe I was here on an off day but it was the most bland Mexican food I have ever eaten in my life.  The salsa bar was good and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.

We went and ohhh MAN, we were glad we did! I'm occasionally skeptical of recently opened restaurants, but these guys have their menu and service dialed, perfectly. All of the food I tried was delicious. And I'm not saying delicious the way most Mexican food is delicious when you eat it...I'm talking TRUELY delicious; from the unique flavor of their smoked meats (I had the pork, carne asada, and shrimp tacos, very pleased with each of them and the experience of the smoked flavoring, which was new to me) to their mastery of the classic guacamole side that was impressively fresh tasting and creamy. Speaking of tasty sides...the salsa bar!! Very good. If you are a topping sauce / salsa nut like me, you'll enjoy the unique flavors their salsa bar provides. And if there is any aspect of this place that I would rate higher than their food, it was their service. Like others have mentioned, it is clear that the staff at TC tacos place a high priority on customer satisfaction and enjoyment of their product...definitely felt welcome and attended to while eating my great meal. See you soon TC Taco! I'll be back.",

We had the chorizo breakfast burrito and the smoked chicken, al pastor (with big chunks of pineapple) and carne asada (very tender beef) street tacos.  All the food was flavorful, made with quality ingredients and reasonably priced.  Especially enjoyed the homemade chorizo and appreciate the use of authentic Mexican cheese in all dishes. With great food, service and a clean restaurant, could not ask for anything more...Highly recommend!",

We had chips and guacamole, fresh made taco chips, very delicious! The guacamole was very fresh and tasty. I had the carne asada burrito, it is big. The meat had great flavor and very fresh tasting ingredients. My friend Laura has carne asada street tacos. She said they where delicious and 2 of them were filling. Also they provide a salsa bar, we tried the tomatillo sauce with good flavor. Definitely coming back to this jem :)",

He was not too hungry so we thought of getting something small and trying out their burritos, Our thought was to get TWO orders of 2 taco kids meals for 5.99 each plus chips and salsa for 2.99 and a burrito and Fried Ice cream. I am PREGNANT and craving tacos and burritos and fried ice cream EVERYTHING.   i started off by ordering the kids meals and didn't even get to finish before the LADY i think Owner told me we CAN NOT Order kids meals because we are not kids. I try explaining to her that we are not too hungry and plus we are also ordering other things but couldn't even explain she cut me off by saying its only for KIDS your an adult.   It got me upset so i just told her thank you and we left and went somewhere else. It was my WORST EXPERIENCE there i think that anyone can order whatever they want to eat and its not fair and very rude and not even sure if its OK for her to reject my order. It was Horrible i will not be back . I been here before during the day and ordered a full meal and even desert, at night i do not eat as much and had a few cravings of course i was so MAD i wanted to cry my hormones. I will not be back to this place at all after they rejected my order!!",

The staff is friendly and the menu is simple to understand and order from, probably one if the most well-thought out menus, pick your protein and then pick your style.  The people I was with ordered the 3 Tacos (each got a beef, pork, and chicken). They both enjoyed their taco platters, and both agreed the pork was the best. I ordered the shredded beef burrito. Mine was tasty, the meat was fantastic. But it was served in a basket. With wax paper.... So cutting said burrito was difficult thanks to the basket. Then, of course, you get to the bottom of the burrito nd the wax paper is torn up and could be missing pieces.   So. Then... You wonder. Did I just eat wax paper?  All in all, it was tasty and a good experience. If we're in the area, we'll definitely go again! Maybe next time I'll ask for a plate. You know, like an adult.",

They were decent, nothing to write home about, but not bad enough to where I would never try them out again.  Years later, I have recently found out they changed ownership.  Not really a problem unless the serviced has changed.  Well, it did change.  I went there to order a breakfast burrito which is supposed to have bacon, eggs, cheese and potatoes.  The burrito that I received should have been called an egg burrito because they completely lacked in having bacon, cheese or potatoes.  The only reason why I gave 2 stars is because the manager gave me my money back which was the right thing to do.  I do have a suggestion for the new owners though....please take down the pictures on Yelp showing the delicious dishes from the previous owners because you're not serving fresh potatoes no more.",

We once did five taco Tuesday's in a row here because it was so fun with great food. The BYOB thing is awesome but nothing can excuse how the quality of the food, high prices, and poor service have become normal.  As a taco place, there should be more than one server working on a Tuesday at dinner time. The meat quality once was excellent. Now it is mediocre at best. I don't ever want to pay more than $2 for such sub par tacos again. We paid $2.75 for two shrimps on a taco.  While we were waiting for the food, someone tried to call in an order but the next thing I heard was the dial tone about 15 minutes after they'd been \"put on hold\" (never having ordered) so I guess don't order to go either.  Their final offense was my telling the server that I don't like spicy anything and asked whether the meats I was ordering were spicy. She said she didn't think they were and then said she didn't really know.  To add insult to injury, the server was loudly chewing gum while she took orders, dropped off food/drinks, and brought the check. GROSS.",

Well I grabbed a couple $2 street tacos and once again enjoyed them. I wouldn't say this place is a hole in the wall, it's got a few tables and is more a sit down restaurant than a take away place, but the prices do not reflect the extra service. It's cheap!

Service was very friendly and quick. We ordered chips and salsa and while the chips were hot and incredibly fresh,  the salsa lacked any heat. Side bar, I had no idea there was a salsa bar, wish I had! The street tacos were pretty good but only the Barbacoa really impressed me.  My husband's burrito was really good,  but could have used some of the salsa bar action that we didn't know about.    Overall we enjoyed our meals and didn't break the bank.

We ordered a quesadilla with smoked chicken and a small order of chips and guacamole.  The chips were hot and delicious (a bit salty) and the guac was excellent...both were good portions.  The quesadilla was made with authentic mexican cheese and the chicken was smoked in house.  Yummmm. I plan to go back soon.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Work nearby and saw this place and pulled in on a whim.  Let me start by saying overall the tacos I had were generally good (Barbacoa, carne asada, and Al pastor). Service was atrocious. Needless to say my order sat in \"hot plate line\" for 4-5 minutes with the chef ringing the bell and the waiter yelling at him to shut up. Tortillas were dry and beans were the worst I had.  Chef finally came out to deliver the food (takes pride in it and meat was very good). People ended up getting up and getting own plates off food line and a few walked out because the process of ordering was too long. Lots of East coast attitude.  Nice salsa bar if you want to fork out additional money for chips. Overall three taco plate with rice and beans and chips with a water for just under $13!  Too many places in the valley with better service and prices.",

It's like being in somebody's home and them cooking their food with some kind of secret ingredients that was passed down from generation to generation. This is True Mexican food!",

The carne asada burro was mostly beans and rice, couldn't even taste the meat. Their portions of rice and beans was also very small in the dinner plate that we bought. Overall  You're better off at one of the Bertos taco shops. Highly over priced. The place was very clean though but we took our food to go, 4 minutes to our house. Will stick to polibertos or tortilla fish if I want tacos..",

You are either a build your own tacos, tortas and burritos or your not.....if you are then I just need to know the types of meats and extras that I can choose from.....if your not build your own then just tell me what is included in the tacos, tortas and burritos beside the meat......beans you either have refried or black beans not frijoles or black beans.......the shrimp tacos needs more substance mainly from the shrimp need a better batter and serve it with shredded cabage, chopped tomatoes with chopped white onion and cilantro, lightly squeezed lime topped with a cream either crema or guacamole cream........my burrito was almost flat. The flavor of the meat was very good but wasnt worth the price...you have something good here just need to up the food in order to require customers to pay 30.00 for a burrito, 3 tacos and 2 drinks....customer service was great.......guys are very friendly and attentive",

Everytime I think I will give it another chance cause it tastes great, but the service I have received negates the food at this point. They nickle and dime everything. Chips and salsa cost extra, I asked for a side of guac, it came a couple minutes before my meal, but was the small side and not the app like I ordered, and when I said I didnt want the guac anymore cause my food had arrived and I wanted it with my chips and instead asked for another side of chips, they told me they would have to charge me for it. These are examples of issues I had the last time I went, which will be the last time I go. I went when this place opened up, there was the family running it, so I excused the poor service for the fact that it was new and a local business. Everytime I have gone in there, they are charging for something else, including the various salsas I got for free every other time I went. Its disappointing that the food is so good, but because of the ownership and service, I will never go back.",

I KNOW my chile rellenos and this was a good one, slightly charred the way I like it. The husband had the 3 taco plate, chicken adobo, chorizo & barbecued chicken. He said they were all good. I tasted only the barbecued chicken taco and had to agree with him.   Their salsa bar is awesome, and they keep it on ice so it stays really fresh. I also had a sampling of their smoked chicken and it was really good tasting. Apparently they make smoked chicken tacos.  Will definitely go back when next I'm in town.",

My meal was very good. The meat was perfectly cooked, the chips were crisp, the tortillas were soft, and the guacamole actually tasted like ripe avocados. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salsa but I think it's a flavor profile and heat preference that I'm not a fan of. Overall 5 out of 5.",

This place was either going to hit the mark or be a \"one and done\". Well, it HIT the mark. The smoked and marinated meats are works of art. The fresh salsas are generally very good - the smoky salsa is the best choice. Everything is made to order, including the guacamole which we decided was necessary to tide us over until we could make decisions on the deep menu. The waitress reminded us it was made by hand upon order, so we would have to wait a bit for it. 2 minutes later it was at our table. OMG - delicious. We are now trying to figure out how to direct all our neighbors over here so it gets successfully launched. And we are going to see if they will let us order up a few pounds of meat for a party at our house. Oh wait, I missed one fine detail - BYOB!! Awesome place",
