So we just left and went to the faithful stand by at Westgate- Yardhouse.",

    "text": "We (5 of us) went into mcfaddens  on 3/19/14 at approximately 7:13, we were sat and 10 mins went by and nobody saw us. I check the time because I'm a server myself and know about seeing people within 90 secs and we were pressed for time because we were going to a concert. So I went up to bar, after another 3 mins the bartender asked what I need and I said no one has seen us and it's been a while. The bartender came out and offered us drinks, I said we needed to order and she said go ahead. We gave 5 orders of drinks and food and she wrote nothing down. As soon as she walked away I said she would get order wrong, I knew she would because she didn't write it down. At least she made an attempt to help us because a server never did. She brought out our 1st round and some water. Then 20 mins went by and we asked about our food. The restaurant was dead, it shouldn't take that long. We stopped some random host/server and said that we have to leave and to just cancel the order. She went to tell manager after a couple mins a girl came over and said the food is ready, I said we'll take it in boxes because we have to go. Sure enough only 4 orders came out and my order was wrong. The manager said he was comping drinks for the wait and the meal that did not go out so he was going to run the payment for remainder of food. I went to go find him and tell him that my order was wrong as well, he came over and verified it was. He said we could have it anyway, and that the other order that was missing was ready. He brought it out and said he was sorry, I told him that I knew it wasn't his fault but our experience should not have happened this way. So after we left I opened up the box to the order that was missing and the bread was burnt to all 3 sliders. My friend didn't eat that, I ate part of the cold burger that I didn't order and girlfriend ate some of her wings - in the car - because we spent 50+ mins at Mcfaddens for terrible service, incorrect and burnt food that we didn't even get to eat in restaurant. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "I used to frequent McFaddens pretty frequently, particularly as a go-to place for a good meal at a reasonable price before a hockey game.  I went there last evening though and this was definitely my final trip there.  Just awful experience.  My party was seated within 5 minutes - so far so good.  Our server was pleasant and tried to be attentive.  However, she was spread across at least twice as many tables as a single server can reasonably cover, so her ability to check in with us was hampered.  I don't fault her for any of the adverse experience though.  The management there should be completely scrapped.  it took an hour for our food to arrive and each person in my party had a very simple meal that should have taken at most 10 minutes to make.  The server confirmed that they had only 1 cook working and he was covering the entire restaurant.  The establishment was filled at every table, so obviously this was horrible planning on the management's part.  When the food finally arrived, it was not what I had come to expect.  I and one of my party ordered our old favorite - the fish and chips.  The price had come up about $3/plate on this meal, but hey, whatever.  However, when it was delivered we had half of the fish pieces over before and less than 1/4 of the fries.  The coleslaw was horrible, too - and that used to be my favorite part.  The portions used to be too big but this was an insane swing in the opposite direction to couple with a significant price hike.  $16.99 for a kid-sized meal from McDonalds.  The fish was also undercooked.  The 3rd member of my party ordered a chicken club.  It came out with this 1/4 inch thick triangle of chicken jerky that he literally had to take the bun off in order to find.  The bun was 2 inches thick in total.  Suffice it to say he got bread with a hint of chicken flavoring.  Because of how horribly inefficient the service was, at this point we have 15 minutes until our hockey game started.  We alerted the server to our concerns when going to pay the bill.  She immediately engaged the manager, but after 10 minutes we had to flag her down to find out what was going on - we still hadn't received a receipt to sign.  She server informed us that the manager decided not to charge us but should have been by.  He never appeared.  Upon departing we found him hanging out on the back patio bar area, chatting and laughing with people that were obviously his friends.  I haven't had such a poor experience at any restaurant in recent memory.  Stay away from this place - it used to be pretty decent but has completely fallen apart.  While waiting for our food we observed much the same with other patrons - very unhappy faces and a few groups that just walked out in disgust without having gotten food served.",

Always poor customer service. Last night Monday 02/25/2013 (so no football )-:) we went there to eat at 5:30. 6 people at bar, 3 tables with customers. 1- host, 2- waitress, and 1- bartender. We were seated right away. The waitress walked past us 6 times and did not acknowledge us. She did bring food to one table and then assisted the other waitress with bringing food to another. She never even stated \"I will be right with you\". After 12 minutes we walked out. It is a shame because actually I am a good tipper. But this seems to be normal there. The food is OK. Nothing great but really nothing in Westgate is. The managers obviously do not care about service which actually may improve the business if they did. The owners should really be more on top of this as again with only less then 20 people in the place they must be doing something wrong. It appears that they only want people to drink there and that the food is secondary.",

We still get the club feel outside with as busy as it gets, it's just not quite as loud on the patio.

All of it was gross! The nachos had 2 teaspoon sizes of Philly meat on the nachos (by the way were ice cold on arrival to the table) the burger was burnt well done which we asked for medium well, the soup was scorched so it tasted burnt. The service was slow despite that there was only a few tables in there. The first clue that I ignored was the place was empty. I was entertaining out of town guests and this place was a complete embarrassment. I will never come back or recommend this place. Also I waited to speak to the manager but Austin never came by, the server Megan said she was searching for him but couldn't seem to locate him for more than 10 minutes! The only shining light about this visit was the awesome hostess I didn't catch her name but she was the most helpful.",

Then came the rude comments and trash talk from the other members of the wait staff.  This happened several times in the hour or so we were there.  When I'm a visiting football fan in another city I expect to hear it from opposing fans, but not from the wait staff at a place where I'm a paying customer.  I found it uncalled for and completely unprofessional.  Never done this before, but thought it was worth mentioning to management.  When we mentioned it to the \"GM\", Joe Keefe, he denied it ever happening and told us we were wrong.  Seriously, why would any of us lie about something like that!?!  I was appalled at his incompetency as a \"GM\".  All he had to do was acknowledge the problem and and take care of it.  Instead, he called us liars.  Then he had the nerve to try and make us feel guilty for not leaving a tip.  First time in my life that I didn't leave a tip.  The service was that bad.  Staff was disrespectful, unaccountable and just plain rude.  DON'T GO HERE!  Had a great time at Calico Jack's across the way.  If you're in Glendale go anywhere but McFadden's!

There is nothing Irish about this place.  We got there and were given a buzzer which required us to give them our drivers license.  Then apparently the buzzers were not charged up so they skipped us until we asked them.  We finally got seated where we waited 15 minutes for a waitress.  When she finally showed up, she waited on the table next to us first and they had been seated long after us.  The waitress said that they changed the seating chart and she didn't know.  Then the food comes out and we ask for silverware and mayo.  It took 3 times and 10 minutes to get the silverware.  We finally asked for a manager.  The food was disgusting.  The fish was dripping with grease and the philly cheesesteak had horrible flavor.  The manager did give us a discount but really this place needs an overhaul!",

But after reading all the other negative reviews I see I was just another victim of their standard operating procedure.  I went there twice in the last few weeks(Coyote's games) and I'm done.  On the first visit I ordered a Black and Tan.  After receiving what looked like a Guiness with powdered sugar in it and waiting 10 mins for the bar tender to acknowledge, I was informed that they don't have Bass and use something else in their Black and Tans.  Naturally, I asked why this wasn't brought to my attention at the time the drink was ordered.  To which the bartender offered no apology, but replied: \"It's on the menu\"  Really!?!  First of all a Black and Tan should have separation whatever you use, and second, who uses a menu to order a beer at a bar!?  On the second visit my buddy was told he had won a  free happy hour for ten people, but it was actually a reduced price in drinks.  I don't know what caused the miscommunication but after the way they treated me the first time, they're not getting the benefit of the doubt.  I had about 15 people come from the East side and ended up picking up several rounds to make it worth their trip.  That was just the main peanut in a pile of poor treatment.   The customer service at this place is miserable.  I have no idea how they are staying in business.  That being said, I can concur that the Turkey Club was quite delicious.  That's why I'm giving the place 2 stars.  I suggest getting it to go....",

There were a few issues that we had throughout our dinning experience but what really ruined it for me was the food and the way it was handled.  I ordered the Beef sliders, which is listed on the menu as \"topped with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle ranch on brioche buns\".  What came out though was a very sad and flat looking patty on a bun with a tiny dot of chipotle sauce. I pointed this out to the waitress and asked where the rest of the toppings are, most impotently the caramelized onions, she told me that they were out of them!   If they are out of the toppings then why wouldn't they tell me this? Our event was about to start at the stadium so I didn't have time to order anything else, not that they even asked me if I would like to.  So I ate the Beef Sliders and they were horrible, the patties were too dry, thin, and plain. I had to cover them in A1 sauce to eat them.   Of course I was still charged and paid full price for these sad Beef Sliders even though they didn't come as advertised.   With the over all dinning experience I can see now why everywhere else around the stadium had a wait and this place didn't.",

Do yourself a favor . Smuggle a cocktail into mcdonalds  and drink it with your mcnuggets off the value menu. It will be a much better experience than here and you wont leave feeling like you've robbed.",

We end up here because everything else is busy. And this is why, poor service and food that is so so at best.  The place is falling apart, the bathrooms are missing faucets  everything is barely ok.  This is the last time we spend time and money here, even my biker BF that spends time at sketchy bars is dissatisfied .  Such a waste",

    "text": "To me this is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde establishment.  Sometimes it's fine and other times, it's scary. For big events this place can be the place to be. The Seahawks take it over for away games in Phoenix. Ohio State took over for the football playoffs. My Gonzaga friends had fun there for the final four. Without big time events, this place is dog shit. Went in on a normal Wednesday night during old car night and there were about 4 people in the place. Sat at the bar 10 minutes with no bartender in sight. 2 cocktail waitresses stood in the service area totally ignoring our presence. The bartender finally surfaced and was an ass hole. Got a beer and moved to the patio where we were again invisible. Sat with empty glasses as a waitress wiped down some tables not seeing our hails for more beer. Hint - look at the customers. Those tables aren't going anywhere. Especially when there are 4 people in the place. Try to sell something! We shouldn't have to beg for service. There are 4 people in the place!  We finally got a beer and put a $20 down for the $12 dollar tab and the inattentive waitress actually asked us if we wanted change? No, Honey, we're dying to tip you $8.00 for being completely shitty. You and the ass hole bartender.   Next time I stopped in for a non-event beer, the place stunk so bad with a sewer smell, we left. Hostess said they had a \"deep cleaning\" the day before and that was the smell. They must have deep cleaned the sewer.  Maybe this place makes enough money on the special events at the stadium, hockey arena and Westgate to keep in business cause I don't see it on an everyday basis. The place sucks.",

But the first time I had been there was the worst experience I have ever had an establishment. I said I would never go back, so after a long time I finally decided to give it another shot thinking ok hopefully after reading all these bad reviews they have stepped it up. We'll unfortunately things have gone from bad to Omg someone needs to close this place down.  Disgusting environment.  Nasty girls with dirty shoes dancing on the same bar where they are serving drinks and food.  The girl who works there as an overweight gogo dancer actually took her shirt off. Not what everyone wanted to see. Letting napkins fly through the air and sop up all the nasty on the floor is a disaster for shoes as when many people walked out had napkins stuck to them.  I just don't understand how the hell the health department hasn't been alerted. I think a call will definitely be made. For such a great location I would expect higher quality than this disgusting excuse of a so called club,bar, restaurant. I highly recommend you stay away.",

By awful I mean the security always has a bad attitude, the place is always a mess and the layout for the dance floor doesn't make very much sense. Its a dive without dive prices. The only selling points is there VIP program which gives good discounts and makes it a good place to invite people since theres no cover with it.   Sadly its the best place to go in the Westgate complex, but if you have somewhere else to go. Go there.",

Secondly, while my wife was in the restroom, one of the waitresses came into the restroom while holding a customers dinner.

Our server took everyone's order (light lunch items) without writing anything down.  I said, \"I wonder how she does that?\"  Found out she doesn't. One order incorrect, sliders with cheese. Second try, still not hot and cheese slices just thrown on, not melted as you would expect. Server really unaware of the menu items. Slow service, lukewarm food for all items.  Unaware hostess.  No real reason to return so we won't. I don't think the staff here really cares about doing a good job.  Stay away.",

We invited some other friends, most of whom are Cardinal fans. The plan was (as it is every week) to spend the day there enjoying football, food and drink. The food was mediocre at best. The drinks were watered down. Service was slow but we stayed because we had good seats. There were about eight of us. We arrived about 2pm. At 6pm we decided to leave and paid our tab and tipped well despite weak food, drink and service. Half of our group got up and left and the other half started a new conversation. We decided to have one more beer before leaving while we finished our conversation. We ordered, only to have the waitress return a few minutes later (not the waitress that had served us earlier) and tell us that they had decided not to serve us because we had been there too long already and they felt we had had to much to drink. The manager stood behind her. I asked them if we had acted inappropriately in any way to lead them to this decision. They said no. I asked if we were being loud or belligerent. They said no. So i asked, \"why are you treating us this way?\" And they said it's our opinion that you've been here to long. That was their only reply. I had never had anything like that happen to me before. I told them that we had never been there before and were there to checkout a club that gathers there and brings them plenty of business. The manager, a younger kid who called himself, \"Sam\" said he didn't care because he doesn't like that club anyway.  I thought, \"wow, people go there and spend large amounts of money to be treated that way?\" We will never return to this dump and will tell that story to anyone that mentions going there ever again.",

The other guy on the right gets a hi and how are u doing what would u like me to serve u, he gets his ice tea, all this time am just looking at her waiting on her to even look at me and acknowledge my presence but apparently that was too much to ask. She finally did and served my beer. It was happy hour lets just said I had one beer and tipped $0 because that's exactly what she deserves.

When our friends arrived they were told there was a $50 reservation fee.  I'm guessing this is how they make money now because the place was dead, including the bar during their happy hour.  We were there to participate in the event going on as well as eat.  So we decided to eat.  We told the waitress we needed separate tickets and she never mentioned they wouldn't do it until we got the bill.   Let's talk food.  The food is mediocre at best, even for bar food and extremely overpriced.  I had a salad that I paid $10.99 for that I could have gotten at Wendy's for $4 and the Wendy's salad  would have more flavor.  My husband said his food was okay but he too has also had better burgers.    Now I realize that McFadden's gets most of his revenue from the football, hockey and other events going on around it but if they don't do something with what they serve and the prices they won't last long, even with a football stadium 500 feet away.

We sat down and ordered our drinks which came out, my step mom ordered a vodka tonic and it came out without carbonation. She politely asked the server for another as this was just a vodka water and she ordered a tonic and they did, brought her out something that tasted the exact same, no carbonation! We finally got to ordering and the food was ok at best. I enjoyed the flavor of my pulled Pork sliders but nobody else at the table (4 others) even finished their plate, and before we had even gotten to our car my boyfriend and I had already begun to feel sick. The service was ok at best. We had a waitress who was new and that was totally ok! She did well, but throughout our time there we were served by 3 different people and all very bland. The only positive is that they have tvs and we were able to at least catch the end of the Warriors/thunder game.",

We immediately go up to the same bartender (as a worker is cleaning up the mess behind us), explain that the brand new drinks got knocked over and he proceeds to say, \"well what if everyone in the bar came up to me saying their drinks got spilled want wanted a new free one??\" So we order another drink expecting not to be charged for it. A couple minutes later we were still upset and decided to leave. Receive our bills and were charged for the spilled and new drinks. On the way out, we are trying to finish the drinks fast and a girl bumps into my drink and it gets spilled AGAIN. We find a manager and explain the story and his response was \"sorry a lot of our bartenders act like assholes.\" As if that made it okay? So he gets us one free drink and then we explain what happened earlier about the first two drinks had spilled and he goes \"wait outside and I will get you guys covered.\" We waited outside and we see him chatting away with the hostess at the front for about 10 minutes hanging out. Basically he had no desire to help us, he shooed us away outside so he didn't have to deal with us.   I've been in the service industry for 9 years and this was the absolute worst customer service I've experienced in a long time. I'm understanding of drunk rude people trying to get free things but this was our first bar and were completely polite. Even worse that we were visiting and this was our first impression of the city. If I could I would give it zero stars.",

This did NOT happen we were practically trampled at the door with such utter disorganization.  Then only to not have our name on the list. After 20 more minutes of waiting and been shoved by the crowd they finally got us in but the tables were not ready.  Once in the bar itself looked cool but that's pretty much it.  The service was lacking and we could not even order food until half time are you kidding me! We have a few buckets of drinks so not to have to wait and a couple shots and the bill was way over priced.  Again with No food.  It took over 30 minutes at the end of the night to speak with someone in charge and then they sent what I think was a bus boy.  The best part of the experience was all the Seahawks fans but I can have that at home I will never recommend nor visit this bar again.  If they have big events there WAtCH OUT it is a rip off!!",

(which I have no problem with as the game let out)  Once we got close the bouncers were very rude to the group 2 in front of us in line.  They were threatening to them.  The next group of three got waved in.  my group of three was told $20.00 cover charge.  I questioned (in a nice tone) the amount of the cover charge.  One of the bouncers very rudely told me thats the price \"and if you don't like it get the F out of here and go somewhere else\".  I asked why the 3 in front of me got let in for free.  He said \"the must of paid online own advance\".  I asked how he would know that as he never checked or asked.  The people behind us were watching.  They then left.  We left as well.  We told at least 20 people in line what happened and they left too.   There is too many places in the area to go for no cover and great service.  We eat to the Yard House.  Great times there.  Wish I had read these reviews before hand as I never would have tried.  Its evident that management/owners don't care as no replies to reviews on here of Facebook reviews.  I guess they think they that close to the stadium it doesn't matter.  Need will be here again",

When the server kept swiping our cards they got declined after the third swipe because the bank recognized it as fraud.  The server then came to our table and loudly announced that our cards were declined.  She failed to mention that she swiped each card SIX times!  She also included a 20% automatic gratuity that totaled $45 which we were never made aware of.  Since when is there an automatic grat for a party of 4? We are now waiting for the restaurant manager to respond.  Stay tuned...  Side note, the service was deplorable.  The food came and we had no silverware.  We had to request place settings and the server returned with a stack of cocktail napkins and no silverware!  The server also couldn't offer us any cocktails because she only knew the beer menu and couldn't give us a list of any other alcohol available. We had to ask repeatedly for water, napkins and all the basics.    They definitely have a good scam going- charge the customers and hope they don't notice or compare bills.  Luckily our banks were smarter than the server, which doesn't require much at all considering she didn't know the difference between a place setting and a cocktail napkin.  Update-.Just this week I was notified by my bank that the same credit card number used at McFadden's was used fraudulently for over $1,000 at another business in Glendale. Since I don't live in Glendale and haven't been there since the incident at McFadden's it seems more than a coincidence.  Some of my family who were charged multiple times haven't had the charges reversed and the manager has been full of promises but no results.",

    "text": "McFadden's found away to make a novelty out of an Irish pub.  Although they didn't do a very good job as Irish pubs are usually awesome.    The service is OK.  Our waitress was really nice.  We had 3 by the time the night was over.  The food is not terrible and is eatable but if you are looking for something worth the money you will be disappointed.  The portions are fine but a ten dollar burger is just a ten dollar burger.  Flavor was over salty and too much pepper.  The BBQ sauce sugary and the cheese lacked flavor even though it goop-ed off!  The French Fry portion was nothing to write home about either.  A plastic cup of beer (Stella) will set you back 5 bucks for maybe 12 oz.  They do have days with drink specials but I went to one of these and they water down the drinks.  I also went to a party where the drinks were only 1 buck and again it was a weak drink.    Bottom line is this place over priced, over hyped, and over used as a meeting spot.",

    "text": "I could go anywhere from 1 to 5 on this place.  First, they have a new menu with prices that are more aligned to what is normal and reasonable.  I've always liked their food.  Last visit I got the fish and chips.  They really aren't chips, they are shoestring and I had to send them back for being cold.  We got an appetizer that was supposed to be 50% off but they charged us $5.50, original price was $7, so half of 7 is 3.50.  Had to bring that to their attention.  Service was good, but we've never had a service issue here.  The ugh.  The place is looking tired.  The booth we were at had a slit in the bench-pretty significant.  The place looked a little dirty.  If they can get it fixed up and cleaned with the new menu and food I think they will be full again.  So McFadden's is on our keep list-just need to keep working out little things.  However, the biggest thing that kept us from making a frequent place was $21 for bangers and mash which are now priced at $13.",

There was no one in the restaurant which now after leaving makes sense. We sat down and had to wait 10 minutes before having our drink orders taken. The place is infested with mosquitos. We were sitting there talking and just kept getting bit. When we finally got our drinks, they were in small plastic cups and my fiancees root beer tasted like seltzer water. We decided to just cancel our food and leave. We told the hostess we wanted to pay for the soda and leave. She said she told our server but our server avoided us at all cost. We finally got sick of waiting and went to the bar to pay but the manager took care of it. I made she contact with our server before we left and she just walked away without saying a word to us. If I could this review no stars, I would. This was the worst service we have ever received and will not be going back to this place.",

    "text": "Just had to share our terrible experience with this restaurant, looking at their listing for yelp, obviously we are not alone so I will keep it brief.  Food, pedestrian at best, although as expected for a glorified sports bar.  Wings were as dry as the desert we live in, worst we ever had, but after interacting with \"management\", and trust me I use that word loosely, it was probably by design to increase beer sales. My wife ordered a glass of wine, received something that was not close to what she wanted and the only response from our friendly but utterly incompetent food server was \"what do you want me to do about it?\", and \"maybe you can reconsider on your second round\", like we were actually going to keep throwing good money after bad and actually risk ordering anything else from this place.  Again, kind of expected from a place like this so we laughed about the odd response from the waitress and asked for the check.  We have always purchased an Entertainment Book, it gets us to try new places and you save a buck or two which is always a nice plus.  We gave it to her on the mobile app, she took the phone to the \"manager\" (again loosely used) and came back saying we cannot use it because the wings were considered an appetizer not a main course and you have to have two main courses to get the one free per their offer.  The wings were about the same price as my chicken sandwich any other real restaurant would have gladly taken off the least expensive item and moved on with everyone happy.  Not this place, even though it would have cost them the same or less than any other main course they refused to honor it.  OK, we laughed again and paid.  Then my wife noticed that they executed the coupon offer on the phone, you can only use it once so not only did they not accept it, it is now invalid for any future use.  Obviously we will never go back here again, even if it were totally free, but the point is they had no right to take the coupon and then not honor their offer.  We explained to the waitress about all of this and that we were upset about the entire experience and she just basically smiled and told us to have a good night.  At the hostess stand on the way out I asked to see the \"manager\" to let him know of our experience and the issue with the Entertainment card, he just stared at me blankly as I went through all the issues and, like the waitress, said nothing except OK.  His name is Baron, in defense of the restaurant I am not really sure he is a manager, looks and acts more like a bouncer and he seemed more interested in impressing the young hostesses as to how rudely he could treat me then actually acting like a manger and trying to resolve any of the issues I raised.  He gave me the General Managers card and told me to call him and deal with it, just what any GM wants in his manager.  Obviously I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, I think we would have been better off going to Jack in the Box, the food would have been about the same quality, if not better and less expensive, the service would have been much better, and at least the Clown would have smiled.....",

The food is not the best, we enjoyed the Irish Fries or something, but we had to lick our fingers, and not because they were so delish, but because the napkins and forks were making their way trough the crowds and to our table. When we left, the hostesses were so into their conversation that they didn't see us leave... oh, well! That's what we get for wanting to try something new!",

They serve blue moon without oranges, Dos Equis without lime, fries with no napkins, salt, or ketchup.  And the finale is that they bring you your credit card receipt without a pen so sign the tab.  The waitress will bring you a $5 beer, and if you hand her a $10 she will ask you whether you need change!

I am Irish. I was excited to find an Irish pub/restaurant. I was horribly disappointed by what we experienced.   Upon entering we were sat by a female I could only assume was the hostess. She informed us our \"server\" would be with us shortly. We waited, used the rest room, took photos and read the entire, less then impressive one page menu. We were finally greeted by our waitress and she took our drink orders. I said waters all around and my boyfriend and I ordered beers. 20 min went by and we finally got our beers. No water. My friend orders her beer after she returned from the rest room and another 20 min goes by and she finally gets her beer. Still no water. We waited and waited for her to return and take our food order and bring the waters. My boyfriend finally got up and asked where our waters were and if we would be able to place our food orders. A few minutes after he sat back down the \"hostess\" comes over and slams four waters on the table, didn't say a word just slammed them all down and walked away. I shouted \"THANK YOU\" and she didn't even knowledge me. Our waitress came and took our food order, which consisted of some appetizers and a kids burger, didn't write anything down and walked away.   We sat there for another 20 minutes. After watching the family next to us get there food and drinks promptly we decided that we no longer wanted to wait there for the crap service to get worse so we paid for our drinks and left. I wrote a note on my sons kids menu that read, \"horrible service\" left that next to the 12$ for our beers and waters and we took our business elsewhere.   This place has potential, I was honestly excited to find a nice Irish bar and restaurant. obviously the management isn't managing ANYTHING, and the criteria for wait and bar staff is bottom barrel. Being attractive doesn't make you a good waitress/hostess. A good attitude and a passion for great customer service are things this place and its employees are seriously lacking.",

BIG mistake. Their menu is the typical Irish bar fare,  greasy and should've been perfect after a day of drinking. Unfortunately, this was not the case. All we wanted were pretzels. Seeing they had it on their HH menu we assumed we could just order the more expensive plate not at the discounted HH rate. Ummm, no. They won't serve anything that's on their HH menu unless it's HH. The service was poor-my friend preferred to compare them to a smelly bottom body part. We asked them what beer they had on tap and were told \"we have a lot, do you want them to name them ALL?\" Huh? I'm sorry that we came into your life and inconvenienced you seeing that your only purpose to be in front of us is to serve us and make sure we have a positive experience in your establishment. Clearly, that was too much to ask for at McFaddens. I've never had such a poor experience in my life.   The food was mediocre and the bathrooms were disgusting.  Maybe, this space is cursed. The Other place that was here shut down too.   Seeing all the reviews on here and being at a 1.5 stars should be a sign. Shut your doors and close up all ready.",

Tried the pineapple habanero wings and these were not too bad also. Ordered a Sheppard's Pie to go. HORRIBLE. Looked like a hamburger fell on the floor and picked up some remnants. Waitress was friendly and did a good job apologizing for her lame manager who made a lame attempt to apologize for not having food and the noise. Then the bill came and I tried to pay and what a surprise \"because we gave you 2 $ off the wings and cheese crisp we can't honor a 25$ discount coupon.\" I had already had enough of this place and the waitress again was nice about it. This is the last place anyone should try in Westgate and I promise never to go back again! There are so many other places to spend your money in Westgate!",

Bartender will walk past you and skip your turn at lest five times before you even get a drink. Pretty good sized crowd but service not so great. We even had a table and you get your drink at the table just as fast as standing at the bar.  Haven't had a great Reuben sandwich in awhile and heard from a friend that the corned beef here was amazing so decided to give it a try in the day time.  The sandwich arrived and it looked really delicious and tasted like heaven. I'm big on sauerkraut and McFaddens wasn't stingy at all.  The corned beef wasnt too fatty just how i like it. I got extra dressing on the side to dip my sandwich in. It came with a side of red potato salad that was also mouth watering.   Will return to eat!",

They really need to double the meat.  For dinner I attempted to order the BLT, but they were out of bacon.  I settled for the chicken strips.  It was your standard issue chicken strip meal.  Not bad, but I could do the same on my own from the frozen food section at any grocery store.  Our server was nice, and attentive.  That was easy though because the place was nearly empty.",

I was here on a Friday night with my friend, drinking, hanging out. And she asked me to take a picture of her with her drink in hand. So I said of course. I took out my phone and right as I did a security guard came up to me and said no camera. I had never heard of this any of the million times I had been there before. So I simply asked why and he grabbed me by the arm and threatened to kick me out if I didn't calm down. I wasn't being aggressive at all and even the crowd around me was telling the security guards that I didn't do anything to be kicked out. But it didn't matter. They just escorted me out and that was that. I've had multiple incidents here but that one was just too much. So I decided I wouldn't go back anymore. I even had my drink spilled on the floor after a different security guard bumped into me on purpose. There was nobody around me for miles but he chose to walk right into me. I had told the manager about it but he didn't even want to hear me. Do yourself a favor and never come here. Unless terrible service is your thing.",

I wasn't drunk, belligerent, or rude to anyone. Was there for about 4 hours had less then a handful of beers, ate food. Just feel it was chicken move to refuse re-entry without a reason.

    "text": "This review is for the night scene here, I have never ate here/been here during the day.    This place has a lot of potential but the security/staff kills the vibe.  It's just typical Glendale bar BS where they kick everyone out for \"looking drunk\"/just not liking you.  Other people I've talked to have had similar experiences here.  Even though they have a DJ and go-go dancers on the bar, you should not dance because they will kick you out for that too.  One time a bartender poured me a beer that was all head and then just gave it to me like that was normal.  I noticed that in the past year it has gone from being relatively crowded every Friday/Saturday night to almost empty whenever I walk by.  Based on that and the fact that the yelp rating is so low, I'm guessing that I'm not the only one who has had a bad time here.    I don't know who is in charge of the staff for all these bars at Westgate, but they should probably re-evalute their training and policies or else nobody is going to want to come back again. It's not like it's even cheap to go out there, and they try to charge a cover every weekend.  I live on the west side, but I'll gladly spend another $15 to take an uber downtown instead of having to put up with bad customer service and the threat of having security kick me out suddenly when I'm just minding my own business and trying to chill out.",

Music was good everyone was having fun. my family was trying to get bottle service. We have gotten bottle service there prior in which they quoted us way cheaper I'm not sure why their price doubled so we didn't go through with it. Later in the night my friend was having a conversation with her boyfriend and was approached by a security guard who goes by the name \"Canvas\" not sure if that was a fake name given to me by another guard.  He told my friend she was too drunk and was causing issues. Which we were extremely confused about because she wasn't stumbling, not trying to cause any fights, nor was she disruptive to the property. So he made her leave in which the whole family had to leave. Still extremely confused on why someone would get kicked out for no good reason. While we were still out waiting for the rest of the family to leave a fight was about to break out in McFaddens and they only escorted one girl out and not both. Makes no freaking sense. What a way to ruin the night. Not pleased with \"Canvas\"",

    "text": "What a major disappointment and I will explain why in full detail. Trust me this place deserves not a single star.  Last night my wife and I went to McFadden's and when we walked in I was happy to see UFC on and everyone was watching the fights. This was the only moment in my experience with this place that was a good moment.  This lasted maybe a half of an hour when we heard an announcement that anyone under the age of 21 must leave. Well, this obviously alienated many people who came to enjoy themselves with their family so you basically will lose potential dollars by kicking them out or asking them to leave. To make matters worse, managers / security or bouncers were asking people to give them their seat and table so they can clear the front of the building and make a dance floor. Again, people were not happy to have to get up and leave which includes the bar stools at the bar. I spoke to 4 individuals around me about what was going on and when they told me why they were doing it they showed their displeasure as well. Many people got upset at what was going on and simply left. I can't blame them.  Now the music started thumping and bumping loudly (In a Sports Bar) and some chick wearing practically nothing jumped up on the bar and started twerking. Really, twerking in a Sports Bar? It was such a classless act especially when I came to McFadden's to watch sports with my wife and have a table to sit at.   When my wife went to the restroom, she said there were 3 chicks grinding on each other in the restroom and one of them was a chick that gave towels and gum as you exited the restroom. Just a classless act and what a horrible place this establishment is.  If I wanted to go to a dance club I would have gone to a dance club. If I wanted to see strippers or to be modest, a chick half naked dancing on top of a bar I would have gone to a strip club or Coyote Ugly.  I am never going back to this classless place. The way in which management was telling people to get out of their seats was unprofessional and rude to say the least. Please do yourself a favor and do not go to this place. Go to the Yard House and enjoy great beer and an a great atmosphere and save yourself the headache.  I am glad I left, and will never return!  Dave",

I asked for a Bloody Mary and received horrible concoction which would have been better off down the drain.  Our second visit was last night before a coyotes game. Every restaurant in West Gate had a 45 min to an hour wait but McFadden's was able to take us in as soon as we walked in the door. (That should have been warning  #1). The restaurant was uncomfortably warm, smelled like stale beer and was sticky and filthy. Our waitress was kind but when it came time to order beer, she had a list with 8+ beers that they have ran out off. (I hope they restock quickly because the Fiesta Bowl is right next door tomorrow). I feel that all the menu items are over priced for what you get.  After 40 minutes of waiting, the bacon in my BLT tasted a little strange and the fries were under cooked. The quesadilla was okay but very flimsy.  The restrooms were disgusting and I honestly did not like being bothered by the \"restroom attendant\".   Overall- service- pretty good food- poor drinks- poor cleanliness- very poor  *** We noticed that this establishment will be a Penn State hub for the Fiesta Bowl, if you are Penn State fan, save your money, time, and taste buds and go to another restaurant in West Gate.",

The bathrooms are so dirty and literally all the stalls have either a broken lock, no purse hook (I refuse to set my purse on a bathroom floor so yes, it's a big deal to me) or no toilet paper....    Besides the bathroom issue, they also have bottle beer that has a metal taste from being in a metal cooler, or beer trough. They obviously don't rotate their beer in coolers.

I've seen bad meals, bad service & bad management before, but this one was epically bad! Should've known better when the apathetic waitress stated today was the first day of the new \"brunch\" menu. Red flag ignored - my bad. Ordered the corned beef with poached eggs over potatoes, green peppers & onions. No toast or coffee included for $10.99.  What I got was a lot of onion (cheap veggie cost) with very little pepper over a frozen hashbrown pattie (think McDonalds) with corned beef that had been over-boiled (God knows when) which left it tough, stringy & flavorless with 2 poached eggs....really more hard-boiled than poached.  I requested 2 new poached eggs which were perfectly cooked, but served floating in a bowl of water. I had a fork & knife, but no spoon so, I managed as best I could to get the eggs onto the aforementioned dish without including the pool of water. Unfortunately, I failed adding more soak to an already soggy situation. I picked at it until finally giving up and asked, via one of the young bussers, to see the manager. The poor young man came back to my table and said, \"He asked me to ask you what you wanted.\"  Uhhhh.....just forget it.  I have more sense than to put a busser in the middle of a situation that should be handled by the manager. Hello? McFadden's corporate office??!!  BTW: $9 Bloody Mary served in a plastic cup with no celery, olives or even a cocktail napkin (pet peeve) etc. For $9 bucks you'd better add some veggies!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  TOO MANY OTHER OPTIONS!",

The sandwich was huge, piled high with corned beef and kraut. The bread was toasted perfectly and didn't get soggy which was a MAJOR plus.   I also had the bread pudding, because duh. If it's on the menu I have to order it, so I did, and YUM. The caramel whiskey sauce knocked my socks off, and the consistency of the bread pudding was great. I'm not sure where all these crappy reviews came from, but maybe they have a new kitchen staff or something?  Either way, I'll be back the next time I'm in Glendale.",

Also, just judging by the location and the decor of the place, I would expect the food and service to be about the same as any TGIFs or Applebees or some other generic restaurant/bar establishment.  As a bar/nightclub, however, McFadden's is alright.  The DJ played a typical set of music for a mostly young/white crowd, but he could actually beat-match songs suggesting he has more experience than an iPod on shuffle.  The beer selection is nothing special, and the drink prices are nothing special.  The servers are nice, and cute, especially when they are dancing on the bar.  There's nothing extraordinary about McFadden's, but the ladies seem to like this place, which means I would like to come back again.",

What we received was horrible service, nasty food and a hellish wait for it. Yes I know McFadden's primary service is that of a sports bar, but I can name 20 sports bars around the valley providing much better service and food. People are still paying for service and food and should be treated as such.   The Sunday we went we had went around 1pm. We were waiting to be seated by the hostess who had her purse slung around her shoulder as she was ready to leave. She said \"Well, I guess I can seat you\". Sorry, all we wanted to do was pay for lunch and drinks. Sorry for the inconvenience. We were sat in a section with about 2 other tables (the bar and restaurant was 'dead') and thought to ourselves, this should be quick. WRONG.   We ordered drinks and it took about 15 minutes to receive them. Then we put our order in. We had ordered items off of the happy hour (chicken strips and soup) and a sandwich. It took 45 MINUTES to receive these items. The Irish Potato Soup was separating and it looked like it had been maturing under a heat lamp for about 30 minutes. The French Dip sandwich was dry as a bone. Despite complaining about both of these items they were not taken off of our bill.   As we walked out I warned a couple going in to make sure they have hours of time to waste if they want food. The guy asked if I was serious due to the small amount of people inside. I reaffirmed him and he and his girl were on their way elsewhere. The least I could do was prevent someone else from experiencing McFadden's service and food. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other restaurants in Westgate City Center, McFadden's doesn't deserve your patronage.",

We waited about 40 minutes for our food to come and we only ordered 3 appetizers to share. Our drinks took a good 10 minutes to arrive and when we asked for extra sauce or a drink refill, it never came. As we looked around, we noticed many other tables scanning the room looking for their servers as well.    The food itself was disgusting. I'd compare it to gas station cuisine only it was served on a china plate and we paid 4 times as much for it. We ordered the \"Irish Nachos\" which was supposed to be crispy fries with melted cheese and other typical nacho toppings. What we got were soggy steak fries (which also ended up coming with the two other appetizers we ordered-fry overload!) soaked in fake cheese sauce with some dried up chunks of tomato. The boneless wings looked and tasted like they were straight out of a frozen package and the sliders must have have been brought over from the local fast food joint...actually, I would have preferred a fast food burger to the measly meat patty on stale bread that we were served.   We ended up cancelling the next round of drinks that we had ordered and left very unsatisfied. An Applebees would have been a serious step up from McFadden's.

So we arrive at 8:45 and they make it out to be a big inconvenience to them that we arrived......15 minutes early.  Nothing was setup, and they scrambled to get a \"party\" table put together (which I don't think ever reached the size we had reserved).  All decorations became \"we could put ________ on the table but........we'd need for you all to get up\".  So after all this I thought it could be a fluke, so we gave them another shot last night......  2nd trip -- Had a friend come in from England and he wanted to go to the bars at Westgate.

    "text": "Horrible. I will never eat at any McFadden's again. We waited for almost 15 minutes before we were even able to order waters. The Fish and Chips I received were so disgusting I actually lost my appetite. They were covered in so much batter most of it wasn't cooked and they were so soggy. I had to peel off the batter layer just to eat the fish. The Caesar Salad was miserable, hardly worth paying $5 for it but ended up costing $14. The menu stated the Caesar Salad without chicken is $11 but we were charged $14 because the menu and our waitress neglected to tell us that their menu prices are wrong. Aside from the fact that their food is gross, the place was so warm, smelt horrible and had flies all over the place. Don't eat here, it's an overpriced dump.",

    "text": "Poor excuse for a \"sports bar\". The service is slower than molasses in winter. The cleanliness of this place is very questionable, considering the amount of fruit flies I continually had to swat away to eat my food in peace. When I finally got say at a table, I could probably have recited the menu from memory by the time the waiter came to take my drink order, it took that long. Food is way overpriced for how mediocre it is. 14 dollars for a half ass Caesar salad? It seems like this place isn't staffed competently to handle the rush of a simple hockey game. Whomever runs this place must think that hiring girls, most of whom look like they were taken off of van buren ave, and given uniforms to work in. Have them squeeze their boobs in smaller than appropriate shirts, and let service suffer because most will be too distracted to care. At least find good looking girls if you're going to use that strategy. Won't be back, surprised this place has even stayed open for this long.",

    "text": "My TWO STARS is because, seating was ample...NOT due to the food, nor service, nor management....  AS YOU MIGHT NOTCIE, I tried this place and wrote a review last year after (Nov 2014) after I did an ONLINE search looking for a '49ers fan' place to enjoy football season.... Not only did I give this place a second chance, but to be fair I came back three weeks in a row!  FIRST! and foremost, according to Joe, the manager on duty ... this is NOT a 49ers bar/restaurant - ummm? then please remove it from the list!. Joe says the GM likes the 49ers, but Joe will decide what games (sound) is on the big screen...   1st week Nov. 2015: food was room temp., Joe (manager in charge) made accommodations for the food.   Not many patrons but lots of waitstaff ... standing around chatting under the big screen... I would think that with that many employees, the individual guest attention would have been MUCH better.  \"49er VIP section\" empty, and told its for PAY only.  2nd week Nov. 2015: asked to sit in the  '49er VIP section' with a large screen... was told, you have to pay. Waited and watched while others came in and sat there.... Ordered shepard pie (barely room temp.) Again, lots of waitstaff standing around chatting with each other... continually waited for service. We pointed out the chicken bone where we had moved the chair from... our server said 'oh, that happens all the time'... um?  3rd week Nov 8. 2015:  upon entering asked again about the VIP seating... The host said NO, you have to pay for that seating. Asked, Joe about sitting there and he said 'paying/reserved  is only on Friday and Saturday night, YES, go ahead and sit there, I will let the hostess' know'.... he went over and corrected the hostess'. Again, lots of wait staff.... our server was pleasant. Instead of bringing Corona Light for the 2nd & 3rd beer, regular Corona's were delivered ... got that straightened out. Mosquitos were galore in this VIP seating area and we kept fighting them off, even asked if they had a spray we could use. There were only three of us in the VIP seating with large screen... asked if the sound could be turned on THIS TV or if the sound in the restaurant could be changed to the 49ers, again after reading ONLINE that this is restaurant was listed as a 49ers location... it is NOT!!! Joe, the manager adamantly told our server he is NOT putting the sound on for the 49ers... during half-time, I went to the bar where Joe was making drinks and asked, nicely, for him to help me understand.... why the 49ers sound was not and could not be played, if this restaurant is a  49ers sports bar?  Still preparing drinks and walking away, barely giving me any attention, stated that the GM is a 49er fan and he Joe, is not, and that he (Joe) puts the sound on for what he thinks will be the GAME OF THE DAY... as I had already studied the patrons (less than 15 people inside) none of which were following the Bronco vs Colts game.... I pointed this out to Joe, he stated ... I am NOT changing the TVs.... very sad.... He said we could call when the games are playing to check to see what sound/game will be playing...  Very very sad....  Sadly, this restaurant has potential... if the cooks could get the orders right, the waitstaff could deliver it before it is cool (and less chatting with other employees) and decide whether or not they are a 49ers bar ... I think they need BAR RESCUE ... before its' too late... and they join the ranks of other fallen bars/restaurant...",

Food was ok. Burger seemed to be a prepatty?  Well then it got interesting.  Online menu shows burgers $10. Paper menu shows $11.00 Bill came up as $12.00???  Watch your bill.. seems fishy to me..  Asked waitress about it, no kidding she asks me.... \"Would u like me to take that off?\"  And then we only ordered one soda, ran up as two.. Asked server about it and she said to get the $25 off the bill had to be $50.00 so she just added the 2nd drink on???  So I asked to have the $2.00 off for the Over priced burgers & $3 for the soda.. and I ordered dessert to go to allow bill to be $50.   She brought bill back still with the extra Soda. I asked her about the extra $3..  No kidding she asks again.... \"Would you like for me to take that off\"  Wow... this was crazy...",

We were very concerned about the length of time for the food, or the quality, considering the place was packed. The food came out right on time, and was delicious (two Southwest burgers). The two bartenders (a guy and girl) couldn't have been more attentive, asking multiple times if everything was OK, and getting us glasses of water when we didn't even ask for them. We've been traveling full-time in an RV for almost 2 years and have visited a LOT of bars and restaurants, and very few rise to the level of competence and quality that we found here.

Takes over 15 minutes to get the drinks. Had checked out the menu online and hubby was ready for corned beef n cabbage. Ooops, sorry, that's not actually ON the menu. After some grumbling, picks the Philly Cheesesteak...Guess what, that's ON the menu but they no longer serve it. \"We're redoing our menu\", sorry. All 5 of us get burgers. After another ridiculous wait period, which we spent watching the manager oogle and fondle all the female waitstaff, the burgers arrive. Two ordered medium rare, three ordered medium.... All burgers are well-done rubber hockey pucks with fake grill marks. Obviously out of a box of frozen burgers. Of the three that had bacon, the bacon on all 3 was stone cold. Two had buns that were cool, one had a bun that actually had a frozen spot in the top if it! The frozen one with ice cold bacon was returned, the rest of us were too hungry so ate. Catsup and mustard on tables, but 8 of the catsup bottles in the immediate area are completely empty! We raid 9 other tables to find one that's half full and present the waitress with the empties as a gift..... And still waiting for that replacment burger. The redone burger still not there by the time the rest of us finished, had to go hunt down the manager because waitress had vanished. Manager solution? \"We can put it in a to-go box for you\". Bartender had thedecency to apologzie and offer a free drink, but too little too late.Absolutely will not give this place a second chance, recommend you steer clear too! Margaritavlle or the Yardhouse would have been a much better bet. :(",

    "text": "My friends and I have gone to Westgate many times, as it is nice to have somewhere to go on the west side of town after games/concerts. Recently I went to a bachelorette party at Westgate for my good friend. We rented a hotel nearby so we could cab it and not have to worry about a DD (safety first, everyone!) We planned to go to three bars, ending with McFaddens. When we arrived here, the girl at the front said my friend - the bachelorette herself - was not on the list! We called a month prior to make sure this sort of thing wouldn't happen. She was rude and unhelpful, but eventually found my friend's name and let us in. We got two drink tickets, which seemed to be useless if there was already a drink anywhere in your immediate vicinity, whether or not it was yours. McFaddens put a damper on things so we didn't stay long and instead ordered pizza and went back to the hotel. I don't like to complain, but my bachelorette friend is the nicest person in the world, so when she was treated so poorly, I felt obligated to say something.",

We got our appetizers on the happy hour menu so the price was right, the chicken fingers were good, and the nachos were average.  We tried to watch the Cotton Bowl, but you couldn't hear the game for the music.  Make up your mind, are you a dance club or a sports bar. The fact that you are next to two stadiums should give you a clue.  The service was also very slow.  When people showed up in the reserved area, our server went MIA.",

After asking the waitress for my bill 3 times, I still saw her walking around & serving others. After 45 minutes of waiting, I finally decided to catch her at the register & tell her to give me my bill. Security standing by the registered jumped in front of me to tell me I couldn't go any closer to the register. The waitress saw that I was upset, walked by me & slammed the bill at the bar in front of me without saying a single word or even looking at me. Had they not had my credit card, I would have just walked away since apparently they didn't want my money any way.   Then, I couldn't believe my eyes when the wanna-a-be security (dressed in regular dress shirt) was blatantly prejudice towards a group of white girls that had one male black friend present. Absolutely absurd! I felt like I was back in high school watching ROOTS!!! I will NEVER again step foot in that place! They better change the staff's attitude real quick or the staff all together! Does the staff not realize that without customers, they would not have a job?",

My fiance and I went there on a Thursday night to meet a good friend that was in from out of town for just one night. After we waited in line for about 10 minutes, the door guy told my fiance that he wasn't allowed in because of the brand of boots he was wearing! Are you kidding me?! We thought it was a joke at first, but then realized through his douche bag personality that he was being serious. Let me just explain to you that these were new, clean $150 boots that this happened over ... So, he did not look like a bum, or whatever they were implying. We stood outside waiting for our friend to come out and witnessed a guy go in with cowboy boots, probably 10 girls go in with boots on, and a guy wearing a baseball hat with a hoodie on with the hood of it pulled over his hat all allowed in. When our friend came out he was mad and asked the door guy what the reasoning was, and the door guy put his hands around our friends throat and pushed him and told him he needed to get off of the property! 5 minutes later the police arrived b/c apparently the idiots at McFadden's called them on our friend, and then they proceeded to tell the police that we were \"taunting\" them because we were standing out front of the bar!!!!! For any McFadden's employees that read this ... Even the police were laughing at what absolute pathetic douche bags you all were for your ridiculous rules!!!  I have never been treated like this, or seen so much disrespect in my life! I hope everyone reads this and refuses to give that place any business!!!",

So I asked another waitress which she finally grabbed my check & brought it back. I left a comment on the receipt, I was pretty upset, did not want to order anything else from the poor service from the brunette waitresses. After walking out I stood on the other side of the street waiting for some friends and looked towards McFaddens and noticed her doing motions towards me like if she was calling me out to fight which in my case is not what a waitress should do on the job , so completely poor service and poor behavior.

Minutes later the manager comes up to him saying he couldn't use that stool and said he needed it asap, my brother told him he was disabled and the mgr replied \"I don't care!\" Wth? I was appalled at the treatment my brother received, disgraceful. On anther note, the service has always been bad, one visit we waited an hour for our food only to be told by the waitress she had forgotten to place our order.

As soon as we walked in I sensed that we made a big mistake. We were greeted by a less than enthusiastic staff member who walked us into the what I can only describe as \"Gloomville\". The place was dark and uninviting with remnants of peoples past meals sitting on numerous tables and in front of patrons clearly waiting for assistance from staff in finalizing their tabs. The table we were seated at was sticky and full of crumbs and the menus themselves were filthy. The whole place was totally depressing and smelled rank with a sports talk show cranked to at least 9 vs any other available sporting event. When we were finally provided service it was from an employee who was obviously intoxicated in some manner. I ordered a bottle of Dos Equis and was given a flat Dos Equis draft. At this point we passed on good and opted to get our bill and leave. The server started actually agreeing with our choice to leave ? It was a horrible experience that mere words can't describe however we are pleased that we ended the pain before ordering any of the McFaddens deep fried cuisine.",

I had my ent coupon book with me and this place is in it so I thought might as well try it one more time since it is a BOGO.  The 1st time we went the food was OK but the service was terrible.  I thought the place was a bit run down but to be expected in the area w/ folks only frequenting it as a place to get loaded on game days.  It was a bit busy that night and they were clearly short staffed so I thought to give them a break.  So when our 1st choice was closed tonight - I thought we would give it another try.  Still terrible facilities...this time there was so much dirt on the ledge beside our table I could write my name in it.  There was only one server working as waitress and hostess - OK I guess since we were only one of 3 tables the whole time we were there.  The tea was clearly old (or from an unclean musty dispenser) and I had her take it back & give me a soda instead.  When she went to bring my soda back, she delivered my coke to another table and returned their credit card to us...I would have been HOT if I was the other guests - it was really shocking - very careless service!  We placed our order including the appetizer and waited.  Waited  Waited  finally our food comes - and we just said take the appetizer off the bill.  She was surprised that it never came out....Really? your are the only server in the place - do you think it grew wings and brought itself to our table?  Ordered traditional Pub faire - Bangers & Mash.  Hubby had Corned beef.  It was OK - the Corned beef was tough - I can make it better at home.  All in all - once again - disappointing.  Above all I can't believe how dirty this establishment is.  Obviously you are slow on non-game days....you have plenty of time to clean and GET ORDER RIGHT!  Will Not be returning ever!  even with a coupon!",

That's just what they do to get by during the day, and you're damned right they are far from the best at it. Where this place shines is as a bar.  As a bar, this place is pretty two faced. It has an amazing happy hour. I've waltzed in with a few friends and received great service, from bartenders who gave great recommendations and were generally very amiable. It felt like one of those warm, 'hole-in-the-wall' bars where you could just chill and have a great time.  McFadden's does have a wild side. Late at night it is a full blown club. Lots of security is there to check the line at the door. Scantily-clad women (hoes) are paid to dance with their ass cheeks out on the bar, or pump you a draft from a keg. Not my scene, but if it's yours then you'll love it. It has a way of being a little bit skanky, but not sleazy or full of creeps.  As for the security, they (especially the head of it) are really cool guys. Don't throw a hissy fit when they ask you to take of your hat/sunglasses, and you'll be just fine. Overall this is a good place I enjoy chilling in when I have money to burn.",

I've been to Westgate numerous times, but never McFaddens. We went during happy hour, & knew we couldn't use it on anything happy hour, but it was ok, because none of our drinks or food were on happy hour anyway. We'd be getting $25 off of our bill of $50, so half off. The place was dead. There were 2 other tables with people.   The mixed drinks, horrible. My husband ordered a Long Island Iced Tea. A Long Island has 4 different kinds of alcohol in it & a splash coke. His drink looked like pink lemonade.  He cringed when he drank it. Me, I hate the taste of liquor. I tried his drink knowing it's supposed to have 4 kinds of alcohol in it. It tasted exactly like peach juice. There was no alcohol in the drink. I would say zero alcohol. No coke either. It was peachy tasting water. We waited and waited on the waitress to come back to send the drink back. She didn't come back. He went up to the bar and told the bartender to remake the drink while he was standing there watching him. The bartender made a new drink. It was an actual Long Island, and looked completely different side by side to the original drink. It tasted like it should have. My husband told the bartender that the next drink he orders, he wants him to make it. My husband orders drink #2, from the same bartender who he already complained to. The drink was just as bad & awful as the 1st one he sent back. He took the drink back to the bartender, again, and told the bartender it was peach juice. The bartender complained, and copped an attitude, saying they don't over pour their alcohol. We weren't asking them to over pour. We were asking them to make a Long Island, that contains alcohol, and not serve watered down peach juice.   The tvs were good. The food was average tasting. The menu food was about $8-$14. They have happy hour pricing on some appetizers, and some drinks.    We were so angry about the drinks and attitudes, we had to leave. The $25 off didn't matter. I'm giving them 2 stars because we did get half off the food, my beers, and peach water.   If you're going for mixed drinks, don't go here. It's the worse mixed drinks we've had. When you complain, they turn it around on you, like it's your fault.",

The service was ok until the food arrived and it took a good five minutes to get napkins, forks, and water... The food was decent but nothing special at all.

I then noticed that there were only 2 servers and a bartender working. Shouldn't have been too bad given the few people in there...but it was. It took 10 mins for the server to come to our table, another 15 for her to take our drink order and give us a menu then 20 mins to take our order.  Once the food came it was decent, but nothing special. Your usual Chilis', applebee's or any other chain restaurant fare. Again, nothing special.  The only reason I see that people would go here is because it's close to both stadiums and in the westgate plaza. If you are going there to only drink, fine, but don't expect the food to be great, or to get any service  FYI they don't even try to have an Irish theme at this restaurant.",

We counted 4 security guards, 3 waitresses, and 2 bartenders. 9 Employees and it took 10 minutes to get someone to ask us if we wanted a drink. Then it took another 10 minutes to get the drink and I think there were only about 6 other customers. Most of the employees stand around and play with their phones.

We got carded on the way in and my brother and husband were immediately told that at 10pm sharp - they had to take their hats off because the pub turns into a night club.  I guess that should have been the warning to just turn around and walk out right there.  But we were meeting some people and we thought we'd try it out.  So we find a table and order a beer.  The waitress says, \"oh can I see your ID's?\"  I explain that we got carded at the door.  She claims she still needs to see them.  Whatever.  So since we are from out of state, she has to get a manager to look at them.    For the love of god, I just want a BEER!  5 minutes later the manager comes by and \"approves\" our ID's.  Thanks dude, we make the over 21 cut by like 10 years.  Seriously.  The other thing that bothers me about this place is that they have a \"DJ\" guy who stands there and plays shitty music, yet likes to hear himself talk more than anything.  Between EVERY song, he has something to say.  This is not necessary, dude.  People don't care what you have to say.  People are here to talk to their friends not listen to you and your shitty music.  Annoying.  At 9:30pm they had a promo where everyone gets a little shot of Guinness to toast to.  But WAIT!  Not without showing your ID for the THIRD freakin time.  Am I in prison here?  10pm comes and the military-like douche bouncers come out.  Yelling at my brother and husband to take their hands off even though we explained that we are leaving.  Other people were wearing flip flops and shorts and other casual attire.  WTH is wrong with a hat?  We didn't want to bring down the atmosphere of their club by wearing a hat, so we left.    Hopefully never to return.",

    "text": "My husband and I come here when we occasionally attend a Cardinals game and stay at the hotel next door. We've come in 4 or 5 times now over the last couple years. I'm here to confirm things and give my opinion. Warning, I may offend some people but this is just my observation.  1. Yes, the bathroom is disgusting. The doors are nasty. It doesn't help that its stainless steel and any smudge shows up. And yes it looks like they have not been cleaned in any way for months. Theres never any soap. The toilet seat covers are always empty, and a few of them are hanging off the wall by only one screw. The only good part about the bathrooms is its open, and at times there is a friendly attendant handing you paper towels. But did anyone stop to think that most of the customers using this said bathroom were completely trashed, and the employees are tired of cleaning up after them for the day? Not condoning the employees behavior at all, but you also have no idea what went on in that bathroom before you walked in there. Also.. haven't we all been to a dive that is worse then this?  2. I can only comment on the bartender service as we have never sat at a table and needed a server. I do vividly remember the first time we were there, and yes the service at first was a little rough. But my husband and I are friendly and started talking to the bartender. We were treating him like a human being doing us a service. We were joking, laughing, and having a good time. Sure, he was getting paid to make our visit enjoyable, but it worked. Then our service was wonderful. Our drinks were full and we were happy. Then, every time after that that we visited we got the same service. One specific bartender actually remembers us every time, and remembers what we drink and before we even get a chance to say \"hi! haven't seen you in a few months\" there is two beers sitting in front of us. If thats not service, I don't know what is.  We have been there during busy times as well. People watching is a habit of mine. Yes, I see you.. yes you. The jerk that demands service but then doesn't tip. The \"lady\" that wants the fruitiest drink ever, and because there isn't 5 shots of alcohol in this said drink they consider it watered down. The college kid that orders 5 different drinks for his drunk friends and then tips $1. That bartender you just pissed off remembers you. He or she knows that no matter what he or she does for you, you will only demand more, and tip less. There was a tall guy quite literally hanging over the bar, yelling at the bartender who was busy making other drinks on our last visit. When the bartender continued to ignore him, the guy was getting pissed. Meanwhile, our beers were empty and this said bartender grabbed us two beers before finally helping this person. Do NOT treat your bartender like less than human and then get mad that you get horrible service. Try treating your bartender or server like you were in their position, and maybe, just maybe they will treat you how you expect to be treated.   Now, there is an exception to that because this place has a long of young employees. Some I could swear are not old enough to even work. And unfortunately a lot of people don't really like their job and could care less that they just pissed you off. They just want the paycheck. So then you have a mixture of customers who have extremely high expectations, and employees that hate their job. Not a good mix. But considering this place has MANY reviews that all say the service sucks and it has 1.5 stars out of 5... maybe you shouldn't go in and then judge the place for its faults that you were completely aware that it had.   Now to the food. Well, I'm no chef, so to me the food was ok. I wouldn't recommend anything. And yes it is over priced. But its food, and we were hungry. After a few beers, we just wanted to eat something. The wings are dry, the mozzarella cheese fritters are greasy, the burger isn't seasoned. This isn't a five star food spot. Deal with it.   One last thing and then I will jump off my soap box. The only real issue we had was on our last visit. At a certain time the bouncers take the bar stools out from underneath you to make room for the crowd. For us to have been there for hours before this and then the bouncer very coldly yells at us \"I'm taking the stools now\". I turn around and ask \"seriously?\". And his reply was \"seriously\". I stand up and he takes the chair with nothing else said. Not a \"thank you\" or a \"sorry\". Just need to learn some manners, thats all.   Ok I'm done. I know its a dive, and everybody hates it, but we are still going to go there.",

Firstly, I want to make it clear that our waitress was very nice and accommodating, so the service gets 5 stars. However. Upon arriving, I ordered a Long Island and my man ordered a dirty martini. I'm not that picky when it comes to drinks, but the Long Island came VERY watered down. It tasted like water and Splenda. I asked the waitress to switch it out for a glass of wine which they didn't have, so I settled for a rum and coke which was also watered down. At this point I gave up.  My boyfriends dirty martini came without olives. He went to the bar to ask for olives and the male and female bartender ignored him for at least two minutes because they were too busy chatting with each other. He moved to another side of the bar and another server or bartender helped him out and added olives to his beverage.  The food we ordered was sub par. His fish and chips were below average, and my nachos were just soggy beyond the first layer of a few chips, and the chicken was bland.  Overall, I just can't recommend this restaurant knowing that the food and drinks were almost ok awful level. Maybe if we hear that they've made major changes to their kitchen and bar we'll head back and give them another chance.",

We decided to give this place a second chance. Big mistake!   We called aHead to verify dress code,  we're told Jean shorts were acceptable.  When we arrived the Security guard at the door took one look at my husband who happens to be balded & has tattoos & said you can't come in! WHen we asked why he said dress code. We then explained that we called ahead & he said jean shorts yes, but not those ones they are too baggy. My husband is a big guy and his shorts were normal guys size shorts. I was so taken back that they were so quick to turn us away,  rather than accommodate us since we had called and came to spend our money in their business.  My husband is a very stylish guy from shirts down to the shoes.  In my opinion it was nothing to do with dress code and everything to do with race (we are both mexican) & ignorant prejudice with regards to how they perceived his look. As white men & women are allowed In with flip flops. That doesn't seem like a very strict dress code.   Customer service is the last thing they are concerned with.  Do not waste your time or money visiting this dump, it's a joke!! When they lose customers & shut down maybe they will consider our business is what keeps the doors open and their paycheck coming.  As for me, I will Never step foot any where near this place.",

Basically this place discriminates against men? Well it shouldn't be a surprise why this place attracts a seemingly predictable crowd.  $8 for beer is a bit much considering i can buy a 6 pack of craft beer for that amount from any store in Arizona.  I will say there are some cool things that happen every so often, but its Westgate! And every West Valley \"hot spot\" has its limitations and highlights. Some examples would be no access to the light rail, nothing the East Valley hasn't done many times over. Also, it's right next to the Cardinals Stadium, so during the football season, it's bumping much more than usual.    Honestly, I have only ever patronized this location because of some deep seeded peer pressure. I have zero desire in my soul to be a patron of this establishment.    TL;DR - A. covercharge and dress code enforced (men only)  B. pricey drinks in a relentless environment  pressuring you to buy more alcohol",

Chicken was grilled, with peppers and cheese. Wife had the hamburger, she said it was good. Service was actually pretty good, kept our drinks full, and came by to check on us a lot. Like I said, if you have an event to attend at the Stadium or the Arena. This is not that bad of a place, however other restaurants in the area are better.",

Keeping the place safe is definitely a top priority, but it can be done without mistreating the patrons.

Sometimes security have egos but they were nice and patient. It was a Wednesday night and had a decent crowd for midweek. Music was good, Drinks are responsibly priced.

This was the worst experience ever and I wish I would have checked reviews before going. First off we sat there for a good 25min before we were able to order, after we ordered the server came and asked us how we were doing which was stupid because all we had were drinks. When our food arrived our server was MIA, and didn't come back. I ordered the Swiss burger which was served cold and RAW, I mean REALLY raw. There were no caramelized onions (as described on the menu) instead there were just raw onion slices thrown on top, the sauteed mushrooms were cold and my cheese wasn't even melted, to top it off my fries were cold and my margarita was warm! Our server was still MIA so I talked to another server and then the manager. By the time I got my replacement burger the rest of my table had already finished eating. It wasn't until I got my second burger that our server asked how everything was ..... NOW as I am typing this I am beginning to feel really nauseous ... I will NEVER eat at this place again!",

    "text": "This place is far worse than just a crappy sports bar with mediocre food.  It's a breeding ground for power-hungry, roided-up bouncers to physically abuse guests under management that has no problem looking the other way.  We watched the Super Bowl there, and look, I get it - it's clearly a challenge for any bar to manage that amount of activity and people.  That said, when they claimed to see my wife cutting in line to use the bathroom (she in fact saw a friend and was going to say hi) -they grabbed her and literally physically slung her out the front door.  She was shocked and ready to go talk to the police about it, but a manager stopped her from doing so and invited her back in. We wish we had left at this juncture.  Instead, after the game finished, the same bouncer approached my wife.  I intervened at this point - asking if there was a problem.  It was at this point that I was placed into a violent choke-hold and forced to the floor.  Other members of my party started video-taping because it was so egregious - other bouncers then screamed at them to turn off the cameras.  And keep in mind, no one in our party was drunk or unruly.  These bouncers simply decided that they wanted to get us out of the bar using a crazy amount of force.  They did the same thing to another member of our party-  who just happened to be the 70-year-old mother of our friend.  They called her a b**** repeatedly and bent her arm behind her back.  We tried to go to police at this point, but the logistics of doing so with thousands of fans emptying out of the stadium at the same time, proved too difficult.  it is our hope to provide local AZ television stations with our videotaped footage to spur potential legal action or at the very least prevent other customers from being physically abused there in the future.  In the meantime - stay far away from this place.  It's awful.",

    "text": "Alright, SO this was my first time here since having moved to AZ and I have to say it was pretty fun! It could have just been the people I ended up meeting because I went alone, but I digress, here's my review:  I went on a Friday night, there was no cover for girls, guys were $5 (I only know because I asked) - the place has a small dance floor, an outside patio and plenty of seating! I liked how spacious it was and the setup flowed well!  The music was actually pretty good, steady tunes to dance to and keep the vibe alive. The DJ played to the crowd which is very important! Too often they try to be unique or different and thus end up playing sucky a** music. lol.  I didn't eat here, I just had drinks. The guy bartender made my drink strong, the girl bartender did not so I guess you just have to select who you go to. I had Jack and Coke's that ran about $7 bucks.  The atmosphere was definitely a little more classy feeling than say Calico Jack's down the way, but there were some things about this place that some could call \"ghetto\". Such as....  By the end of the night there were people dancing on the bar with their shirts off and sweating buckets and some girl basically just wearing underwear/booty shorts. I couldn't tell if she was a GoGo dancer or just a patron who took her skirt off! Bleh!! Also the girls that work here wear skimpy clothes, but I guess don't believe in going to the gym?? I'm all for people being comfortable in their own skin, but if you're hiring people to be half naked at least make sure they're in shape! They jiggled and wiggled all over the place!  NOT cute. lol   The bathrooms had an attendant, but she just seemed to give you soap and paper towels and not do much else as it was kind of a mess. I went into one stall and there was no toilet paper on the roll so I went out and asked her for some. She came over looked under the stalls and handed me a roll that had fallen on the floor!!! I seriously was like hell to the NO! I told her, \"I am not using that!\" She looked at me like I was being a diva and gave me a fresh roll. lol really?  They stayed open all the way until 2am, but once it was over, it was OVER! We wanted to take a picture before we left prompting a security guard to yell, \"take your pictures and get out!\" lol it was actually kind of funny.  Anyhow, if you're around check this place out. It might not be your regular thing, but it was fun and worth a shot if you're up for an 'interesting' crowd!",

He was dressed very nice but had a tattoo (small-non gang related) on his face. He was immediately judged, humiliated, and discriminated against saying he could not come in there establishment. Although he was very humbled and said okay and politely walked away It was more than obvious he was embarrassed and ashamed at the fact he was  treated so harshly. Upon getting home we pulled up the \"dress code\" listed on McFadden's website, although NOTHING was said on there about facial  tattoo's there was plenty about hats and baggy jeans that was not being enforced, due to one of my girlfriends walking right in with her cardinal baseball cap. I feel it was discrimination and handled VERY  inappropriately. Being as  this establishment  is in a well known  area that gets allot of tourist attractions it amazed me the treatment we received. The next morning I called to speak with a manager myself right when the business opened to voice these concerns. The young lady who took my call stated no manager was in the establishment to speak with but she would have some one call me back. I asked her kindly to please get me a return call as soon as possible as I would further like to discuss the issue. That was Saturday around 11am when the business opened. It is now Monday morning and I have yet to hear back from anyone . Maybe a manger hasn't been available? I will not return or frequent this bar with my friends anymore for the lack of respect and the judgment that was made .Further more I am looking into numerous lawyers for a discrimination law suit AND I will contact every media source / advertisement I can that praises this  this bar and share my experience  SADDLE RANCH on the other hand (located right across the way) was very friendly and accommodating and let us in without any hesitation.

Music selection was really good and the drinks were decent. It was 12:45 and they called out last call so we ordered a martini. 15 minutes later the bouncer starts trying to kick us out. He was super rude and said that if we don't chug our drinks he would take them away. I did not appreciate his behavior due to the fact that you enjoy a martini not chug it. I was planning to celebrate birthday here but I will be taking it elsewhere. If you want people to drink in your establishment don't kick them out when they just ordered a drink.",

    "text": "Well, I had been warned by many people not to come here, as it seems the yelp reviews match what I've been told. So I go on a saturday night for a \"night out\".   In what world is this an irish bar? Tip: turn it into a mexican party bar and you'll do much better. However I fear the the health of the patrons here. But I'll get to that in a minute.  1) wait wait, $5 cover here while no cover at saddle ranch -which has way better service? HA!   2) service was absolutely horrendous. Yes, the bar was crowded on a saturday night, but I'm not a noob to the club scene. It shouldn't take standing at the bar for 10 minutes to get a drink when you're not 3 people deep. I've never seen so many workers behind a bar with such slow service. Everyone looking like they're working but nothing really getting done. Too many bar backs?  3) Here's the most troubling. I saw at least one bar tender scooping ice with a glass. Um, are you retarded? How do you have a job as a bar tender? This is one of the biggest no nos as a bar tender. Hope you like glass shards in your drinks!   Definitely won't be back.  Oh and it looks like many of the TGIF restaurants in the valley are turning into Mcfaddens. Not that I went to TGIF in the first place, but definitely won't anyway.",

Gave four stars because we sat in the outdoor patio, just us two, and put at a table where I had to face the wall. I saw other people at these table and  same situation.  they're  too large for two people so someone has to sit facing the wall or be to far away. If four people then two people face the wall.

The bar got as much money as they could out of us, and than kicked grandpa out. I asked why and a 5 foot 3 bald man with the boondock saints veritas aequitas tattoos on his hands approaches me with his arms crossed in attempt to enhance his biceps and do the Swayze tough guy look from road house, looks up at me and lies to my face saying the old man needs to leave, he's too drunk.   1 problem. Old man wasn't drinking, his family wouldn't let him. I tried to get him drunk. Every time I tried to pass him a drink, someone would stop me or grab the drink from him.  I explained that to Norman Reedus's long lost cousin and he said \"than why is he falling all over the place\". I explained calmly, he's an old Guy with Parkinson's. He tells me, no no he's drunk and you all need to leave.   So were kicked out because a sober elderly person with a disability had trouble walking through a dark crowded bar and accidentally bumped a table.   We paid the bill and bounced but as we were leaving one of the bouncers decided to say something negative and than posture up to one of our friends, a friend who is active military and currently on leave, whom was also being very respectful as he usually does. Look back to see the bouncer whose acting tough talking nonsense is the same one who took the bribe to let us in while at least 20 people waited in line.  My friend started walking back to respond, and so the bouncer coward and yelled for police .    These people have ZERO RESPECT FOR VETERANS.   Bottle service here was mediocre at best. The bottle was opened before getting to our table which tells me it's a refilled bottle with some cheap product in it.  Tequila shots with no limes or salt for the table. We asked for pints got bottles.   The same 5 second clip of a dancing robot played all night on every screen in between the windows screen saver like transitions.  The music was mostly from 2001-2005. If they played a new track it was for maybe 15 seconds, you know just long enough to where you don't have to pay for the rights to play it.   The bar has signs they sell cigarettes but direct you to the bathroom to buy them lol  and the bathroom guy sells loose cigarettes for $1 each.",

So my friend and I get escorted out leaving our fresh beers on the bar. Great management!! That sure makes me want to come back. I'll gladly share my feelings with anyone I come in contact with.

    "text": "Once again, I was given ample justification in my recent 45 minute experience here of why I tell everyone that I meet that McFadden's is the absolute worst clubs/bars/restaurants that I have ever been to on the West Coast of the United States (I have not been to the east coast yet).  I am honestly shocked that this place is still open after their years of not even attempting to break mediocrity, but I suppose that at least I can chalk that up to the fact the the hedge fund that owns all of these bars is apparently well managed.   I walked to the restroom and smelled propane, strongly.  Once I came back, I mentioned to the bartender that I smelled propane while walking to the bathroom his response was \"..... well, theres not any heaters outside soo..... I mean common sense would tell you that theres no propane... right?\"  To which he continues \"... Maybe you guys have been drinking too much or something.  How about I get you another one?  Do you want it warm?  I mean your friend has been sitting here for like 30 minutes and barely has drank his beer.\"    I have no idea where to begin with this guy.  I would say that I was shocked to be disrespected at such a high-volume and highly advertised place, but lets not forget we are talking about the sess-pool of insecurity and mediocrity that is McFadden's at Westgate.  I hope he enjoyed pouring drinks for us and making the base $3 an hour salary that he is accustomed to.  I will say on a positive note;  out of the countless times that I have been here  -- this is the first time that it did NOT smell like urine upon walking into the building.  So keep that up.",

However we asked for Bleu Cheese & waited for 20 minutes ..... until we had asked and she said she forgot. So by then of course it was cold.  After dinner we went outside to enjoy some music and really wanted to dance. The music was terrible! Nothing at all related to St. Patrick's or even today's hits. It was early 90s rap & pop...

I said to him that \"I know you're a smart man and I know that you can clearly smell that there's no smoke on my breath as I'm talking to you.\" After trying to convince him of this a couple of time he the. Told me to hold on as he went to investigate. He radioed to the guy that was watching me and said that I was good. Mind you that I was sitting in the VIP with my friends. I don't like how these gentlemen were so willing to kick me out without proper information but I like how they were willing and committed to removing the person that was accused of smoking in the bathroom.  I would probably never come back here again due to me being Falsely accused of smoking in a bathroom when I'm clearly not a smoker. I'm so disappointed!",

And last but not least, who says if you want to leave you can???!!! I'm sure we will think twice before going back.",

    "text": "For a place that should be accustomed to dealing with large crowds waiting to get into the nearby arena and stadium, this place is a mess. We tried to get seated for dinner approximately an hour and a half before a concert at the University of Phoenix Stadium. The hostess told us the wait was over an hour so we went to the bar instead. As we stood there, we discovered that the majority of the tables in the restaurant were dirty and not being bussed as the restaurant appeared to be badly understaffed.  Later, as we stood at the bar, we asked the bartender if we could order food there. We were told we could only order food if we were seated. We then asked if we could drag chairs to some empty space at the bar. We were told this was not possible as the space was supposed to be left open. Within five minutes, we watched another guest drag over a chair and sit in the space and the bartender said nothing.  This place is a mess.  Don't even waste your time.  I can't imagine how, in this location, you would not have proper staff to accommodate a large crowd for an event that was announced over four months in advance.  There is another review below that puts this perfectly into context: at any other location, this place would already be out of business.",

We then place our order for a pepperoni pizza and it came out fast maybe cause one of the security guys brought it out. We still had to flag down another different waitress just so we can get some plates. When they where brought out all the plates where wet an still dirty as hell.

    "text": "It's Always Cloudy in Glendale  I imagine the imaginary Paddy's Pub would serve better food. As long as Charlie Day isn't at the grill, that is...  The first sign of \"Uh-oh\" at McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon (2/5 Stars) was the electronic menu outside that was displaying a Windows error in digitally showing said menu. Still, I'd like to give it a shot.  Inside I was floored on how plain it was. Mostly, it looks like a restaurant, but it hints at being a night-club following after (dinner) hours. It wasn't dirty or run down, just mediocre.   After being encouraged to sit at the bar, my friend and I asked for a table. It was a Saturday afternoon and virtually no one was in the place. (Eventually, other patrons came in, but not enough to fill the place. I even quietly joked on the way to the table that the place was too loud...but the hostess heard me. Of course she did.) The waitress was prompt and extremely energetic and enthusiastic, two pluses in my book. She was also patient since this was my buddy and I's first visit.  I ordered the \"Classic Burger\" since I wasn't hungry, but I love a great burger. (Side Note: Why do they always call it \"Classic\"? Is that the polite and professional way of saying: you have no real taste in food, so just order the easiest and most cliched menu item?) My friend ordered the Mozzarella Salad and the waitress successfully up-sold him on adding chicken. I included fries and an iced tea to my order.  The wait was not uncomfortably long, but then me and my friend love talking movies and getting carried away with film-tangents, so I admit I lost track. But, I do know it wasn't that long of a wait.  Sadly, the plate that arrived had absolutely no presentation. Just the typical toppings on a boring bun (which I wasn't given the option of the type) and seasoned steak fries.  And the silverware was grossly stained - probably hard water, but I refused to use it, just in case. Sadly, there wasn't a steak knife to cut the burger.  My friend said the salad was just \"okay\" but the chicken dry. My burger and fries were just as they looked: boring. Not necessarily bad, but far from \"Classic.\" And the tea was slightly sweetened - a negative for me. But, even if I liked sweetened tea, it was rather weak.  We were invited to fill out a survey from our waitress encouraging us to return to the \"nightclub\" the place transforms into following dinner hours...I was right! Ha! Unfortunately, it sounded like their version of a \"hot spot\" wasn't really clicking with the customers - they're willing to give out gift certificates to get people to show up by filling out the comment card. Only, they wanted to call me to give the award so they requested my phone number. Yeah. Right. Well, it's not 1992. I'd much prefer them email me and I'd reply or respond with a call if I'm interested.  Overall, in this economy (hopefully, we won't have to use that phrase sometime soon) and in the WAY UNFORTUNATE status of the Westgate shopping district, McFadden's isn't doing much to make sure their seats are filled. I wouldn't completely discount it, but I wouldn't completely recommend it either.  Full review condensed just to two letters: Eh.",

Ordered from a special menu ( extra high prices ) for breakfast the food wasn't that bad, compared to the C rats we had in 1969. We asked for butter for our toast and water by the time we were almost done we asked another employee and he finally brought us some. When the bill came I didn't notice the 20% tip was included, I tipped $8.00 on a 35.00 charge plus the 20%.we would have done better having breakfast inside the stadium.  Interesting comment from above, our credit card was also compromise 9 days latter for $230.00 at two locations in the area, not pointing any finger, just saying. I suggest the manager spend some time at Ri Ra's in Las Vegas, now that's a real Irish bar with great food and great service.",

Since she was buying I said ok.  Should have looked at the Yelp reviews first.  Also should have noticed that every other restaurant near the arena had a long wait and McFadden's... no wait at all.  This should have been a clear sign to stay away from this place but we went in anyway.  As we walked in the hostesses at the front desk were ready to seat us right away.  The male manager came toward the front desk and said \"Ladies, how are you doing?\"  Both of us said \"Great, thanks\" only to find he was looking at the girls who had walked in behind us wearing skimpy dresses.  He completely ignored us despite the fact that we were right in front of him and talked directly to him.  So rude.  Our waitress came to take our order wearing Victoria's Secret yoga pants.  Really?  I ordered water to drink because I'm not a beer fan.  The water tasted like sewer water.  It was revolting.  It was 110 degrees and muggy outside so for me to choose dehydration over that water, it was truly foul.  Both my friend and I decided to order burgers (the menu has a VERY limited selection).  She ordered hers medium rare and the waitress told her they couldn't cook it less than medium.  She said ok, whatever.  She also asked for a side of ranch and a side of mayo with the burger.  When I went to order my burger I asked for it well done.  The waitress said \"sorry, we can't cook it any way other than medium.\"  What??  I have never been to a restaurant that was unable to cook food the way a customer wants it.  What's the point of being in business if you can't cook meat the way a customer wants it cooked??  She said on event days it's too busy for them to be able to cook anything in any different way.  There were 4 tables in the entire restaurant with patrons sitting at them.  Even the tables in the bar were empty.  So having 4 tables means they're too busy to make food the way a customer wants it.  That is flat out ridiculous.  I will not eat meat that is undercooked so I decided to order the philly cheesesteak sandwich instead after being assured the meat in that sandwich is actually cooked.  Our food arrived... my friend's food arrived with no side of ranch and no side of mayo.  The waitress brought them out later.  My cheesesteak was soggy because they use a runny cheese sauce.  My friend was also disappointed that they don't toast the buns on their burgers either.  The only redeeming thing in our meal were the fries - they were very good.  But you can get good fries anywhere.  I would never go back to McFadden's.  I'd rather wait an hour for one of the other restaurants in the area.",

The transformation started by taking away all of the chairs around the bar and then abruptly shutting off power to 90% of there TV's - in mid game!   At first I was a little pissed but, I honestly just laughed as we got our bill. It really was a joke! I will say the bartenders were very good and the gals were very hot - especially the plaid stripper skirt the one bartender changed into and gave us all a nice view every time she went into the lower coolers for beers!

The  average household income for the City of Glendale is just over $45K; so the club's marketing team does good by reaching out to patrons outside of the City, and they raise revenue by serving food throughout the day. However, the food service and quality has always been mediocre to me. The building size is big, but they don't allow you in certain areas during the nightclub hours that could be used for bottle service.   The crowd usually is not rowdy, and attracts age groups of 21-40's. With that being said, the DJ focuses too much on playing older songs for the older crowd, killing the vibe for the younger crowd who wants the latest hits. This club also doesn't promote bottle service, which generally is 50% of a nightclub's income. Every time I go I usually have long wait times for drinks because the small amount of bartenders they have working, during busy hours, are slow. Not to mention the lack of hospitality skills in general for the staff. Worst of all they have a male staff member that is shirtless and dances on the bar.... Somehow this place is still open.",

It was just 4 of us and very few other patrons. I.had to look for a chair that wasn't broken and after 4 attempts I found I felt safe to sit on. We only ordered beers and when we asked for a 2nd round we waited 20 minutes and still our beers weren't delivered. I searched for our waitress and she was just standing at the end of the bar on her cell phone and when I asked her if she was bringing our beers she just so said \"oh sorry I forgot\".  At 6.00 dollars a beer this was disappointing!  Broken chairs, ash trays and tables outside were dirty. This place is a disaster and will never go back. Oh, and the smell of sewage from the bathrooms was horrible!",

Our waitress was unattentive and lingered coming back to the table. They were out of the fish and chips, so I ordered a burger. My husband ordered the Shepherds pie, and we had the jalapeno poppers. The poppers were ok, my burger was cooked correctly but lacked flavor.  My husband ate his shepherd's pie out of hunger. This is not a good restaurant and bar.  No wonder it was almost completely empty when the other restaurants/bars who busy. Never again!",

Yeah, definitely groups and hoes.  I have never tried the food here. Ever.  This last time there was no cover since a buddy did the happy hour route-- which is: if you have like 8 people total, give them your name and guarantee those people will be there, they will give you a \"host bracelet\" and free drink coupons, and the rest of your group will get bracelets which gives them $2 well drinks and $2 beer (nothing fancy, so you've got to like Bud Light)  It is right across from this country themed bar with a mechanical bull, so that's a fun distraction for a while... but it's not like either of these places are Vegas-class or anything.  additionally...  Do NOT drink and drive. Like ever. But ESPECIALLY from this place-- there are cops EVERYWHERE. Cops standing right outside the doors looking for the drunkies... cop cars parked all over the parking lot.  Don't be afraid to get into the passenger seat of your car, toss those keys into the backseat and take a niiice looonnng nap until you're sober, or someone comes to pick you up.  ENJOY!",

The service was awful, the server delivering our sloppily made apps, tots a toddler wouldn't touch, she dumped half the plate on the table and then tossed out a half ass \"sorry\".  Before she left we asked if we could get some ice water and she instructed us to \"ask your server\". Ummmm, ok. Thanks. Onto the drinks. We ordered a beer tower. They brought it to our table...filled with hard cider. Not beer.  They fixed that somewhat quickly. Then our main courses. Looking around the table at everyone's plates you would have thought we were at cheap McFastFood establishment. It was a total fail, wilted lettuce (not supposed to be wilted) waterlogged tomatoes. Questionable \"fish\" and chips and a lovely turkey wrap that looked as though it came straight off a costco platter full of those little wraps you get for big parties when you dont want to do any prep work. Yep. Awesome. Never going back. Recommend you skip this place and wait in line for one of the better restaurants.",

Go eat and drink anywhere else. Their service was atrocious and the food/prices don't make up for it. Despite being deserted, we were given a buzzer thing to wait for a table (told a 20 minute wait). We went and sat at the outside bar, which only has 3 beers on tap. After waiting for 45 minutes, we checked in at the front to see how much longer it would be. The lady said she had been calling our names over the microphone...clearly the microphone doesn't work in their outdoor space and the buzzer thing never buzzed. The hostess then told us the buzzers don't work...why give it out then? And why not get us from the bar? Having clearly requested an outdoor table, we were seated indoors. The menu is small and doesn't have much of anything interesting. We ordered onion rings, and a lot of beers. The onion rings came out immediately and based on their sogginess, they obviously had just been sitting out in the kitchen. Beers weren't poured great (small pours).",

On top of it all, it did not taste good. The chicken had no flavor, the onions were microscopic and the peppers were also non-existent, like the cheesesteak itself. It happened to the table next to us as well. Poor waitress had no idea because she didn't deliver the food. Not worth my money.",

We called ahead and was told there was no wait.  We arrived and asked to see the menu at the front desk.  After reviewing the menu, a seasoned employee instructed a trainee to seat us and bring a highchair for my daughter.  We literally sat there for 35 minutes and watched 2 other families be seated and have there orders taken.  No one ever came to take our orders,  We just sat there, and sat there, and sat there. So my boyfriend decided to go ask for someone to service us and we sat there another 10 minutes.  After the server walked past our table twice without even looking our way, we got up to leave.  As we were walking out, the seasoned server said, \"Have a nice day.\" She knew we had not been serviced. We were not nasty, rude, loud, disrespectful, or anything that would give them reason to treat us so poorly. The only thing we were that night was Black, hungry, and ready to pay for our meals. I will never, ever, ever, ever, go to McFadden's again.",

They only have what, 5 real entrees on the menu, and couldn't serve 2 of them; 1 was out and another wasn't prepped.  The food didn't taste bad but was far from impressive. The Shepherds Pie was bland and was made with canned peas and carrots and plain ground beef, and the corned beef was dry and had little to no seasoning. At least the bread pudding was good. The bathroom had no soap in any of the four dispensers nor paper towels in either of theirs.

The issue I had was with the bartenders...They were way too caught up in their lives and social circles to bother with anything else. It had that feeling to where you are there for them instead of them being there for you. So expect to wait on them and let them finish their conversations, flirt and so on... Too many other good bars for me to return.",

A lot of my friends like it but it's not my thing. It gives pub a bad name.",

    "text": "This restaurant was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had in all aspects. I'm an extremely easygoing customer and I usually like to make friends wherever I go - I'm not a complainer at all. My experience at this restaurant was extremely awful. We were seated for about 15 minutes and no one came to take our drink order, so we had to go seek a server. They said they would have someone come over, but after another 10 minutes I went to find a server again, when finally someone came to take our order. We asked for waters about four times but didn't receive them until we expressed frustration about not receiving waters. We asked for our appetizers first because we were starving but got them out with our meals. They only gave us one of our appetizers and one of my friends didn't even get her meal. We ordered shots and one of them came in a disgusting glass - there was a lipstick stain on one side and I'm pretty sure there was ketchup on the other side. We finally asked to speak to a manager, who came over and listened to our frustrations. He said my friend's entree would be comped and that they would get her a fresh shot. He did not seem apologetic at all or like he was in the wrong at all. If I were the GM of a restaurant I would be so embarrassed about the kind of experience we had. We told him we didn't even want the other appetizer because we were over it, but he brought it out anyway. The food was actually horrible but we were too hungry to care, and the descriptions on the menu did NOT accurately represent what came out. So the tab came and he didn't take anything off - not even the second appetizer that we told him we didn't want anymore. We expected something to be comped, at least our shots. We had to get the bill rectified because he didn't take the entree off that he said he would. My friend also looked at her bank statement the next day and they charged her twice. This was actually the worst dining experience I've ever had.",

At CHICAGO's McFadden one can dance on the counter top, bargain shots with the bartender, and dance to Journey until you slip on the beer-slicked floor....  NOT the case at Glendale's pathetic \"irish pub\" creation. The happy hour is the ONLY time worth going to this establishment. Any other time is a WASTE of your time. I literally wasted a whole hour at McFadden's watching a tramp-stamp competition at 10:30pm on a Saturday...  The bathrooms are nasty. The music is the worst... usually just techno and trance crap that is NON-danceable!  Additionally, there is no dancing allowed on the counter-tops...WTF.",

    "text": "Never been to McFadden's but a coworker suggested it for lunch on 4/3/2015.  When we arrived, I was surprised to see there were only about a dozen customers scattered throughout the huge dining area.  We sat ourselves, (two of us), at a high top table.  When I sat in the first chair, the bottom seat cushion was unattached and sank into the frame of the chair.  No problem, I'll grab another chair.  The second chair had part of the frame missing and was so wobbly that I couldn't use it either.  Third chair was the charm.  Now I must admit that I watch some of these restaurant programs on TV and perhaps it makes me biased, but I don't think so.  Anyway, we were greeted by a male server who provided us with the simple one page menu.  He also took our drink order.  A minute later, a female server arrived to say that she would be our server and if we would like to order drinks.  We told her that the other server already had that under control. Not bad so far, other than the chair thing.  As I looked around, however, I started to notice how beat up the place looked.  Seemed dirty to me as well.  So, after perusing the menu, I decided I would ask the server if she would choose the fish and chips or the bangers with mashed.  Her response should've given me a green light to get the hell out of there, but so it goes.  Anyway, she said she was concerned about what she eats and hadn't had either, so she couldn't offer a suggestion.  Alrighty then.  I ordered the fish and chips.  By the way, looking at the prices I expected much better quality.  $16 for fish and chips and $20 for the bangers with mashed.  Yikes!  Pricey lunch menu.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  The fish and chips came with three decent sized pieces of fish, fries, coleslaw, and tartar sauce.  The fish was seemingly battered mush.  It had no flavor at all.  The fries were luke warm.  The coleslaw had no seasoning and tasted bland.  The server came by at least three times to see \"if we needed anything\".  I assume she was choosing her words carefully, because if she asked if everything was alright, she would get an earful.  No, everything was not \"alright\". As a matter of fact, most everything was sub-standard and there is no way I will go back to spend that kind of money for something with so little care in preparing.  By the way, with a gratuity, the bill for the two of us was $45.  Two orders of fish and chips, a diet soda, and a glass of water.  Not awesome.  How does a place like this stay in business?  Oh yeah, nightlife partiers who only care about the alcohol selection.  Good luck.",

They took it down after explaining there weren't any specials. The fact that there was an \"event\" meant NO happy hour specials.... Zip, zero, none! Really you can't have even one beer on special? Lame.  Wing orders have to be ALL one flavor & you get 8. You can't get two \"flavors\". I guess that would be too complicated. A bit later we ordered a burger & a club sandwich. I kid you not, they came out in under 2 minutes! Obviously not made fresh for \"our\" order... Big disappointment. And even though the menu reads, \"all burgers cooked to medium\" it was well done.  Honestly the soft pretzel twist & the chocolate dessert stand inside the venue concession area looked better than what we ate at McFadden's. We won't be going back to this joint.

We found it weird as we were sitting there that an employee left, went to another establishment, and came back with food from there.  That just seemed rather odd.  The carpets were very dirty in this place.  The food itself was not bad.  Their fries actually are pretty tasty.  My mother in laws caesar wrap was really dry.  Very, very pricey for what it is though.  Maybe at night if you are looking for the bar scene it is not a bad place.  As a casual meal with your family it is overpriced, mostly tasty, and the server we had was very cool.

    "text": "We are Seahawk fans and wanted to come to this so-called Seahawks bar to watch the Superbowl to be with other Hawks fans. Here was our experience:  1) We paid $105 per person for standing space since the place was fully booked. It said the price included a buffet of food. They had a couple trays of nachos and wings for hundreds of people.   2) Waiting in line was so confusing. We were supposed to have access to it from 4pm-end of the game. Waited for an hour; fought through the line to ask the host, he had no clue of what was going on and said we were in the right line. Found out later that we were in the walk-in line, not the line with people who had reserved a spot (this was a blob of people, not a line). We finally fought our way into the bar.  3) Whenever the Patriots scored, someone blew a horn.. Seahawks bar?? Not to mention some Pats fan (a guy) pushed me when I fought my way to the bathroom.  4) When we lost the game, they played the song \"We are the Champions\".. WTF. I would rather they just slap me in the face directly.  The whole experience was awful. At some point some punk Patz fan threw (Yes, he really threw it!) a tray of unfinished food on a large table of Seahawk fans and then wanted to fight. Sauces and food went flying everywhere and got on people's shirt. After the game, not only they trash talked, they also took off their shirts (the guys) and flung it around and wanted to fight.   The whole reason we picked a Hawks bar was because we want to be with other real Hawks fans. This is a flip-flopping bar. Whoever wins, they support. Overpriced, overcrowded, rude staff. Never again...",

On Super Bowl Sunday we were never even able to get inside McFaddens and you were letting people in and only charging them $20. I think that is extremely unfair especially considering that I payed 10 times that amount. I understand the fire marshall not letting us in immediately, but I don't get why you let a ton of other people in who didn't have tickets. What was the point of the tickets? The tickets were under Laura Lee Dootson and Susan Nguyen. Please let me know if there is someone higher up I can talk to as I refuse to be charged for an event that I didn't even attend. Thank you, Laura Lee",

Whatever the man's real surname is, the service here is deplorable even without having to deal with removing illicit charges from your credit cards.

Our waitress was more concerned with the tables full of older men and their fat wallets than ours, even though we had arrived first and were polite. My boyfriend asked if they had Oktoberfest for their seasonal beer and the waitress responded \"No\" without offering up any alternatives. We finally got our food (which was really good!) and we ate for a good 20 minutes. In this time my boyfriend finished his beer and was never asked if he wanted another. We were both finished with our food, no sign of our waitress, no follow up on food quality. We waited and waited and she finally decided to show up and we asked for the bill. We have her a card and when she brought it back, the bill included an 18% gratuity. I consider myself a pretty fair person, and if I had seen the mandatory gratuity listed on their menu or had been notified beforehand, then so be it. This came as a shock to both of us and best believe the service we received was in no way deserving of 18% gratuity. Monica needs some training on how to properly wait tables and should take lessons from the other servers in the restaurant. We saw the other servers surrounding our table more often than we saw our own server. Train your employees so you don't lose business.",

Seat cleaners were empty and one door was had duct tape holding it together as a repair job. Seems like any chain restaurant should have better standards than this.  The bar was not busy but we waited forever for drinks, appetizers and refills. I was not impressed and my boss who suggested McFadden's after our event at UOP stadium, was very displeased.  We had a group of no more than 8 people, who arrived one by one. The server was unable to get drinks and orders taken in a timely manner for new guests. We ordered hummus for the table and when the pita and cucumbers were all gone, by boss asked for more pita to finish our hummus. There must have been some sort of mixup with another order that was placed because the pita still didn't show up after 20 minutes had passed. The manager had an excuse about the server ringing in an order as an appetizer vs. entree. I'm aware this mistake happens in serving. I was a server for years, but in this situation I feel that if you ask the kitchen for some pita, it shouldn't take that long even if the server made a mistake with the order. It only takes a minute to heat up and put on a plate. We could have been satisfied with a simple we are sorry and we are working on fixing it right now.   It seemed like even the manager would rather make an excuse than just get the job done. A manager should set the example and level of customer service for the whole restaurant. It was a sad display.   I don't see myself returning to McFadden's for any reason in the future.",

I had a polish with fries and some bangers and mash. My wife had steak and shrimp and the food tasted pretty good and the beer the waitress recommended was also good but the service was subpar. It seemed like the waitresses wanted to sit in a booth at the back and hang out rather than work. They all seemed to look forward to their break to go shop at the outlet stores. Anyways for being one of only a handful of tables, we expected much more attentive servers and better service. We were even thinking about getting dessert but ended up going to ask for the check since nobody checked on us.",

Next thing we know they kicked him out . For literally no reason , there was absolutely not reason .   I went back to the guy that grabbed him and ask \" why did you kick my boyfriend out and his reply was \" it doesn't matter , it doesn't matter \"   Now how the hell you going to tell me your a legitimate establishment when you can't give a reason for kicking someone out ? I mean he could have said he was too drunk ( if that were the case ) but the guy literally gave me no reason , wtf ? And to top it off Cameron was the lightest person in their , could I say this guy was racially profiling him ? I won't because at the end of the day I think the guy was just a plain ole deuce bag . But this has got to stop people need to learn respect and to communicate . You can't just tell someone to leave because you don't like them ect . If we were loud and bothering people I could understand but literally all Cameron did was have his arms around me as he was talking to me about if ever had a \"future daughter ..\"\"  When they pulled him aside .   I am writing this post in hopes that it finds people that will follow in suit in not giving this place business because  they obviously decide who can stay and who cannot , without a valid reason . After leaving I checked yelp and they are rated 1.5 stars , which now I understand why . I also want to add I was sober this whole time , not one drop of alcohol so this isn't some drunken misunderstand",

    "text": "This place is always a great time on a Friday or Saturday night! People everywhere having one hell of a time and DJ always spinning the hip tunes! It's got a great feel once the music gets turned up and the tables clear out for sure! I would say this place is in my opinion the most entertaining place inside Westgate on a Friday or Saturday night.   The only things I dislike about their business operation is the fact that they charge a $5 cover charge to get into the place. I wish I can just tell the door I plan on spending over $100 in booze once I get in and then get a no cover charge. Seriously it's like a slap in the face charging a cover! It's a good way to turn away people. I see it all the time.   Well any-who... Once you get into the joint it's pretty cool. They have a couple beer tub girls serving bottled beers and a huge inside and outside bar. Once this place gets cracking the dance floor can get pretty energetic and intoxicated ladies usually somehow end up on the bar shaking it. Pretty good eye candy I might add! Haha  Staff behind bar seem pretty organized and adequately paced getting and fulfilling drink orders. They have a good amount of security on staff, so if you plan on getting rowdy, you might want to plan on answering to Glendale PD, that is after you're carried out of the place.   If I were to give this business some great advice and a little gem of profitability over the other establishments... Get ride of the cover charge and slightly increase the price on the inventory! ;)  Just a thought... But who am I right?! Haha",

    "text": "This review is LONG OVERDUE. When you read reviews saying this is quite possibly the worst restaurant/bar, they are not exaggerating. I have been here MANY times.. Mainly because it's convenient for my friends who live on the west side, and also because it's easy to go to after the coyotes game.   Don't get me wrong, this place used to be mediocre a few years ago, and it wasn't dreadful. Now I am seriously SHOCKED when I hear it is still open.  Let me give you a little run down of the experience here...   They are DESPERATE to get people in. If you are on their \"VIP\" email list they will legit email you every weekend and say you have won, and you can get free drinks from 9-11.   And when you get there... They don't have the AC on and they will have all the doors open so it's 115 inside. You will be sweating and crying and wondering where your life went wrong that you had to come to mcfaddens.  The music is usually good.. That's the ONLY plus.. And I mean ONLY.   They give free shots to girls every Friday and Saturday and usually it's fireball. They will make them get on the bar and dance.. It's usually pretty entertaining to watch. The drinks are WEAK.   They have this Asian male bartender who will ALWAYS get on the bar and take his shirt off and do some sort of weird breakdancing. He thinks he is God's gift to earth. this is also very entertaining.   They like to throw hundreds of napkins in the air and scatter the entire dance floor. Not only is this extremely annoying, it's also disrespectful and wasteful. It's makes me cringe. And they get stuck to your shoe and you look like a teenager from a bad 90's movie who is coming out of the bathroom with toilet paper on her shoe.  If you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, go in and order a beer, stand in the corner and watch the shit show commence. You're welcome.",

A couple hours later the fights start breaking out and the bouncers start forcibly removing anyone with a buzz that doesn't have a pair of breast. I've actually watched a bouncer fight a guy because the bartender put a spot light on him for not tipping, all the while getting the entire place to boo the guy and call him a cheap a$$. The guy \"for some odd reason\" got upset by this. Overall this place is a trashy somewhat seedy place. Pretty sure the bathroom attendant was selling Coke on one of the busier nights I was there.

My girlfriend and a few others wanted to go here lastnight so I went as well. We were there for about ten minutes and I was about halfway done with my drink when a bouncer approached my girlfriend. He told her she had to go and that she couldn't pull one over on him. She asked what he was talking about and he said that she had already been kicked out for the night. We told the guy we just got there and it  must have been someone else. He told us that we were not going to discuss the matter and to leave.

Go here, it suits you well.  ~Fud/Drink~ I smiled when I saw Restaurant in the title for this place. The food is consistently sub-par, even the apps are lackluster. I got sick here prior to a Coyotes game, thank you McFaddens for making me howl PRIOR to the game itself. I thus, never have eaten here again, because why bother when you get sick from an appetizer. Not too appetizing. You go here to get wasted, but where is the fun in that? Speaking of drinking, the drinks are average as well. Its your average bar option, nothing with pizazz. I could recommend it if there was something of note, like Saddle Ranch's Beer Tower, but they aren't even that creative here. The beer's are expensive as well. Why am I paying so much for these suds and wretched food? It's just a lose-lose situation. Also, its a poor choice if you want something Irish, because its a saloon, right? Haha.... If you come here, later, during the game, you will be asking yourself  \"Why did I come here.....?\"  ~Atmosphere/Service Just when the food is bad here come the waitstaff, who are not quite bright in the head. You go in, you sit down, and they do not attend to you quickly. You would think after repeated attempts to waive your hand in the air (I rarely do this, its a necessary evil), that they would see you. They don't. They must have some kind of Ray Charles syndrome. Or Stevie Wonderitis. Can you name another blind person style syndrome? Message me with one and I can add it, because that would be what the waitstaff must have... Actually, the blind are upstanding citizens with amazing senses, they would probably do a better job, hence I feel bad bringing them up. Oh well, anyway....   ~Extras/Rating~ You might be surprised they get even two stars...and heck, they really do not deserve them. I give them one star for the location and another for still, after all the bad experiences, not being the worst bar I've attended to this point. Congrats to that! They are more worthy of 1 1/2 stars, but why not, I have pity on this spot...so two it is. Just stick with me on this one, and stay away guys! Leave this place for the drunks.

My friends came over, I told one what just occurred and she simply asked the women if they called me the said racial slur. One of the girls signals a McFaddens security guard (her friend) who asks to have my friend removed from the bar. I go outside to confront the McFaddens security guard, and proceed to ask him why the ladies calling me racial slurs were not removed, however myself and my friends were. He proceeded to confirm those ladies would also be removed. This never occurred. I have the entire conversation on video, as well as lack of promise that culprits were removed from the establishment.

I had assumed from walking by in the past it was a reputable establishment but the poor reviews were so numerous.  Boy, was I surprised! Now granted it was a Sunday late afternoon and it was dead. so we were seated promptly. Classic rock played medium-softly in the background. Lots of TVs with sports shows surrounded us.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Our drinks arrived in a couple minutes. (They had happy hour pricing. Buds $2, well drinks $3, some appetizers $4.) Some drinks are limited as they don't have a blender. So you won't get a frozen margarita but one on the rocks. Our food arrived in several minutes. Everything was hot. In fact we had to wait for it to cool off!  My Reuban sandwich ($10.99) was big and piled high with tender corned beef on thick marbled rye. Seasoned steak fries were hot and crispy. My wife's BBQ wings ($9.99) were big and meaty and the honey BBQ sauce made them look like jewels. All was good. I'd go back.  Maybe all the bad reviews made them change their ways. I did take away one star due to high prices. They could stand to take a couple bucks off.",

Skimpy isn't bad as long as you fit the image, and these girls did not.

    "text": "We stopped by here prior to The Who concert to get a couple of drinks and a bite to eat. The place wasn't to busy yet so we thought it would be perfect being so close to the arena. We were seated outside and asked about drink specials, which we were told there were no specials despite the sign hanging right by us stating otherwise. The hostess came and took the sign down...classy. We ordered some appetizers consisting of hot wings, which were not hot and they could not split favors. That was beyond them to do that. The wings were deep fried to the point of being dried and taking on a jerky like consistency. We also ordered some onion rings, which ran $10 for a plate. These were not your hand battered good onion rings-they were straight from the bag frozen and done in two seconds. The ranch dressing served with the wings and rings was about as thick as water and didn't taste much better.   We decided to order a couple of sandwiches, which we figured would be a huge mistake but we were hungry. My wife ordered a club in \"Texas toast\" and I ordered a half pound bacon and blue burger. I kid you not the order came out as soon as the waitress put it in. There is no way this was cooked to order. The menu said burgers are cooked medium, mine was super well done with no hint of juice. I have no idea at what point the meat weighed half a pound because the \"meat\" I got was something McDonalds wouldn't serve. My wife's Texas toast was nothing more than regular dry toast. Pints of beer are no cheaper here than inside the arena. The bottom line....go somewhere else when going to an event here or go inside and eat. There's no pride in the cafeteria food they serve. I can only think that they stay in business since on event days they are bound to get a few suckers in there that haven't tried it before. It's to bad having a great spot and all. The valley is loaded with fantastic Irish pubs and this joint should be embarrassed to even consider themselves one. I hope one day this spot is taken over by someone who actually takes pride in what they serve, even on the busiest of days. A busy event should not be an excuse to serve garbage.",

Those days are long gone, and this review reflects a chaste,  Labor Day lunch experience. No one peed their pants, or vomited $2 well drinks into the fountains outside. Be forewarned.   My boyfriend decided that he wanted to take me to Cabela's...not because I am a camper or outdoorsy girl, but because I have a love for all things elaborately themed. After traipsing through a delightful faux wilderness of guns and taxidermied animals, we were famished and ready to go just about anywhere to eat just about anything. We ventured across the street to Westgate, and McFadden's is where we happened to end up.  We walked in, and the place was just about empty. A courteous -  if a bit disconnected - hostess seated us at a table for two with big, comfy leather armchairs. Soon after, we ordered some nondescript beverages and surveyed the scene. Pretty classy interior for something set up like a sports bar/grill combo. No complaints about the atmosphere...lots of TVs, if that's your thing. \"If that's your thing\"...I use that phrase a lot in reviews. It's annoying. Sorry!  My boyfriend ordered the Pit Burger, and I ordered the Turkey Club. I can't speak for the millieu in the evenings, but we found the restaurant during the day to be very conducive to conversation, and enjoyed ourselves while we waited for our food. My Turkey Club was incredibly delicious...like, I want to eat another one. Right now. The fries were great...they are seasoned, but the menu doesn't tell you that. My boyfriend loved his burger, and the mashed potatoes he got to go with it...but I found them to be a little flavorless, and too buttery.   It's not a cool, hipster-points-hole-in-the-wall place, and nothing about it was special or gimmicky, but the food really was excellent for being something simple and unpretentious. Just regular lunch fare, at good prices and in a pleasing environment. The staff, as I mentioned before, was friendly enough, if a bit restrained. I wouldn't tell you to go out of your way to try it, and it really should be 3 stars, but that Turkey Club is still on my mind. Mmm.",

    "text": "Wow...it looks like this place does not have many stars from other people...I didn't even look at reviews before writing mine. Tomorrow I'm going to try and track down the corporate office. Even one star is too much!  Patron's beware! McFadden's in Glendale, Arizona has hands-down one of the worst customer service policies ever! It is like this bar runs on a crew with their heads up each other's asses! Basically, this place SUCKS!!!   My experience was so terrible the only way to keep it together, without writing a book, was bullet points: * Attempted to organize an event for 20-15 employees. Had an office member contact the restaurant the week before to set it up. Relations person was more concerned with taking the credit card info to charge us if we did not show, or had less people, than sending the agreement. We never got anything in writing with these policies on it! Surprise, surprise...the only thing in the file was the credit card without a booked reservation. * Tried to call the location the day of the event to confirm. Was told by the hostess that I was not allowed to speak to a manager about this issue and she would not find someone for me to check the reservation. Called back with a different name and held for 14 minutes to speak to a manager that just said \"Sarah\" was off and would be coming in...Um, how is her staffing my issue? I had to badger her to even look into the issue. * Finally worked out the details and had tables reserved, the day of the event while my party was on the freeway going to the location. The first guests arrived after making our complaints to the manager and one of the bartenders made the remark \"Those are some big shoes to fill\" to our assigned server in front of guests. What, because we had to call to make sure we had a place to go? * The place smelled like vomit!! (Also noted in another customer's review) * Terrible, terrible, terrible service! Our server would only take one drink order at a time and often left the table without asking the customers with empty classes if they wanted another beverage. Hello...dumb ass...empty glasses means more opportunity to make more money?! Maybe the mandatory 18% tip for the party size blew our chances at having any sort of service.  * Drinks and food were sent to our table that we did not order. Food runners gave us attitude and stormed off when we told them the food did not belong to us. * Bill arrived with over $100 in extra charges for drinks we did not order were on it. We asked the server about it and her response was \"Well, I am NOT taking them off\" and walked off.  * Had to ask for another manager to come over because of the inflated bill. Took 20 minutes for him to get to us and the restaurant was not even busy. Manager was extremely patronizing and was not going to help us at first. After having to re-hash the details he took some of the drinks off, but not all of them. He claimed that the service \"might\" not have been that great because it was St. Patrick's Day that week. Didn't they have like 364 days to get ready for this?  * Waited another 30 minutes to get our change back. After coming back to the table the server put the bill and change in my face, glared at me and walked away. No \"thank you\" or anything for the 18% tip she was guaranteed because the size of the party. In all honesty, I would have totally stiffed her if it were a smaller party.  I was embarrassed that my group had to experience this. The only reason we decided to go there was one of my guests had won a happy-hour event there. My gut feeling when I could not confirm the reservation was to just go somewhere else, but was afraid that the only thing they would do correctly was charge the credit card for a no show. Knowing this I would have taken the group to Applebee's where we would have expected this. Our state relies on tourism and looking at the issue from a higher level the industry decline in does not rest only on the economy, but at these eateries internally. I am starting to point blame at the terrible customer in the service industry, weak and inexperienced restaurant/bar management, and shoddy company policies for their decline. If the industry truly cared about customers it would not be in this predicament.  Did anyone notice that their staff member was the only one to give this place like 5 stars? Maybe she should be a customer in it instead of part of the \"family\".",

We didn't have to wait here and I can see why! People know better than to come. Calling this place an \"Irish Pub\" is like calling my Chrysler a Porche. There isn't one Irish thing about it, except they serve Guinness. Big whoop! Almost all bars do. The service is terrible and everyone seems to have a major 'tude. Gee sorry for interrupting your social time of you chatting away with your buddies on the staff. The food is average in taste I guess. There were ZERO veg options so I had 3 sides, which was interesting. Everyone else's food seemed okay, except for my husband who ordered honey medium wings and they were making ME sweat just sitting next to him. He suffered through them, but was for sure not what were ordered. When we mentioned it to our server she basically gave us a blank look and did nothing. We had quite a few drinks here before a concert thinking it would save a little money from buying 11 dollar beers in the arena. How wrong were we!? Plus, they ran out of pint glasses and had to use plastic. The place was maybe half full? We split our check in half for the 2 couples and my mouth hit the floor! 75 bucks was HALF!?! For 3 sides, an entree, 3 wines and 3 beers. Just...wow. Lastly we were in this awkward table that lined square up to the server station, and made me feel really claustrophobic sitting inches from this giant awkward wall.  I read in some reviews this place turns into a club later at night! This made me LOL literally. I can't even imagine. Save your money and pride and stay the hell away from here. Seriously.  I have to say, the management must not care. 99 percent of these reviews are horrible and nothing has been done. Oh well, guess they will learn when they shut down, because I can't imagine that's far away!",

The waitress met us at the door and told us that some of the items had been deleted or altered (chicken instead of beef on their Philly Cheese Steak????) the menu has been changed but they have not come back from the printer. A very limited menu and not very cheap either. Our burgers were obviously frozen preformed patties, like you would get at Costco.

Decided to give them another try since we had a $50 gift certificate for them... never, ever again!!! The place smelled like it was having sewage issues, it was completely empty of customers except us. We were given menus, spent 10 min deciding what we wanted and then the hostess came back and said she had mistakenly given us the regular menu and that they were on \"event\" menus this week because of all the extra games going on.  She explained that the event menu was just a condensed version of their regular menu... um NO, that was not the only difference. ..the event menu is more expensive and does not include happy hour (which we were there for). Apparently the manager was the one to direct the hostess to replace our menus. Clueless!

Ewww. I know it isn't vegas but cmon managers hire somebody who can at least dance and has somewhat of some musical rhythm. I had this urge to get up there and push them off the bar and steal the outfit but why do it if I'm not the one being paid.

It's was probably 110 degree outside in the Desert Summer.   They had ALL the doors open. It was well over 90 degrees inside the location.   1 of my guest actually said it was cooler outside.  The paramedics actually had to come cause someone fainted in the bathroom.  The staff was completely RUDE!  Every last one of them!  The security told 3 of my female attendees that everyone was leaving as he was checking their IDs to get in.  Half of the staff were posted up on the back wall, with one foot on leaned up on the wall let they had to hold it up.  The server hardly ever came over to take drink orders let alone clean up!  I was bussing my own tables.   The one time I went to ask the server to come over she was in the back service well.  And not 1 single employee moved from thier wall post so I could get by to ask her to come take care of the group.  When I asked someone to turn the lights up so my group could see papers they were filling out for the event, he made a HUGE deal about it.  Then when I went the second time to ask about the lights again, I stood at the bar and over heard 2 of your employees bad mouthing my request! If you didn't want the group there you shouldn't have booked our event.   Never again will I set foot in this horrible bar even for a drink, let alone bring it a 50 person event.",

    "text": "Maybe a Sunday night of a Cardinals home game is not the best night to experience McFadden's but if they can't handle the football crowd then maybe they shouldn't have opened their doors at Westgate.   The female bartenders were RUDE. They passed my friend up several times before letting him order his drink. And, they got snarky with people sitting next to us. They seem to be cut from similar cloth and it ain't pretty.   The 30-45 minute wait for a table turned out to be more than an hour. No surprise, but they didn't bother to tell us we could have gotten a table on the patio off of the bar right away.   Ordered the turkey club sandwich which was supposed to be served with bacon and cranberry mayo on Texas toast. Guess I looked like I need to trim the fat from my diet because my sandwich was baconless. And, they ran out of sliders, buffalo wings and boneless wings BEFORE 7 p.m. What kind of bar runs out of bar food before the peak dinner crowd has even arrived???? The fries were pretty good and our table service was very friendly at least.   There are lots of TVs all tuned to the game and the Cardinals and Vikings fans all seemed to be getting along well. No pushing, shoving or name calling. So, the first impression was not great but I'm willing to give it another chance ... maybe.",

    "text": "Been here a couple of times before and was ambivalent about food, drinks, & service, everything was just ok. Most recent visit my food & drinks were again ok, but others in my party were dissatisfied. In addition, service was so abysmal that the manager took off 50% off the bill for our entire party of 15. Who can stay in business doing that? I don't understand why servers are not better trained. There is no excuse for not providing a better customer experience! Also, do something about the disgusting restrooms!",

    "text": "Place sucks bad. Bartenders are horrible except this one bald guy , he's polite and generous with the drinks. The staff thinks they wear tight shirts and they're atuomactially tough guys. There's seems to be like 20 managers there and still can't get a straight answer from any of them. VIP isn't that special there unless u get there right at 9. The hostess there are rude and you can tell they hate their job. My friends ask me to go back but I honestly rather spend my money else where. Horrible horrible.",

    "text": "Hit McFadden's last night at Westgate when there was no game at the arena.  The service was great but the food was horrible.  We got the tater tots.  When they came to the table I asked what was supposed to be so special about them.  I was told they are tater tots and that was what they were.  I will save my $10 and cook them at home next time.  We got the BBQ burger to split.  The hamburger was something I would expect from the school cafeteria and bacon on top was obviously cooked a couple days ago and kept in the warmer.  When we sent it back the waitress politely told us that she didn't think they would do anything since we had eated over half it.  I pointed out we each had 1 bite to confirm one of use wasn't being too picky. Sounds like they have a bunch of food sent back. They did end up removing it from the bill. The Onion rings were good but that is it.  It is too bad I bought a reward package to this restaurant before checking it out.  Going to check out the one in Scottsdale.  Hoping it is much better.",
