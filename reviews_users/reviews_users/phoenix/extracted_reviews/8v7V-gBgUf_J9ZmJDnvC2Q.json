    "text": "This place is lucky they have great wings. Their service is quick, but horrible! If you're one who cares about how staff treats you, you will walk out of this place stressed almost every time. I continue to order because they do have great sauces and are less than a mile from my home. I just try to speak to the staff as little as possible to avoid a stressful experience. My recommendation to the restaurant, teach your staff the value of great customer service. Sometimes great service is what makes a company superior than others...you already have AMAZING wings, think of how you can gain repeat customers/retain your customers by adding that little bit extra. A smile, an extra upbeat attitude can make the world of a difference, even for your employees! MAKE it fun for you & your guests. PLEASE!",

I live their music, and love to see a black business that encourages and supports their black youths! I love the wings (always get Spicy ATL), I love the fries (always get ATL seasoning on them), and the honey biscuits with powdered sugar is to die for! I am just waiting for 11am so I can get me some wings! The only objection I have is their customer service could use some attention. Nothing too bad to the point where I feel offended or will stop coming in, but there were a couple of conversations that probably shouldn't of been discussed in the front around customers...also sometimes they be cussing loud which is fine by me but some people could be offended. I love coming in the mornings when the owners there cooking and taking orders....everyone is in their place but things do get loose when he is not there. I am a manager so these are things I noticed. But again, I absolutely love this place!",

Regularly I would go to ATL for wings considering my previous experience but, the last visits were less than average; the fries I was served were \"soggy\" and lacked any seasoning this same issue has occurred on multiple occasions. Today I went to ATL again, expecting the service to be better but, yet again I was disappointed, I ordered boneless barbeque wings and instead was served bone-in wings yet, I was charged for the boneless wings. The cashier even repeated the order to me stating the wings a boneless.  Although my first experience was great, ATL's quality has slowly been waning and at this rate I may not return to this restaurant again.",

Not a huge wing fan but I like them on occasion. I looked on line and saw they had a salad on their menu. Who can say no to a green salad with tasty chicken chunks? The flavor I chose, with a little help from behind the counter, was citrus chipotle. Excellent choice, a little sweet, a little spicy. The staff was upbeat and joking with the customers. It was lunch time and a line to the door and they didn't skip a beat. Plenty of parking. The restaurant was clean. Even though it is highly visible, several restaurants have failed here.

I sent my husband to pick up the order and when he brought it home he said he was assured by the restaurant the order was complete. I called immediately after pulling everything out the bag and spoke with Jahlese who advised I needed to bring the order back to the restaurant in order to receive the missing wings. I explained to Jahlese by the time I bring the order back, I would not be taking the same order home she replied \"Oh well, this is our policy, they would not be making a fresh order\". although, this was their error! Needless to say my husband and I drove back to this restaurant and returned the order entirely. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!",

    "text": "So I saw the\"now open\" sign for this place last week and told myself the next time I had a taste for wings I would come here...well I had a taste earlier this week and forgot about them and went to my usual spot Wingstop, as usual my wings were just OK, not as good as they used to be years back when I practically lived at Wingstop.   So l made the decision that l would no longer waste my money with them and their mediocre wings and I continued my quest to find the perfect wings..and I've found them here at ATL Wings, upon entering everyone was very friendly and welcoming. The cashier asked if this was my first there when l began to inquire about the most popular wings, I told her it was and she suggested a spicy rub (atl spicy) which she offered me a sample of. The end result was me ordering the atl spicy, lemon pepper and I told her to surprise me with another flavor.  The Atl spicy is SPICY..that or I'm a wimp lol, they were good though, the lemon pepper was just right not to lemony with the right amount of salt, now the surprise was really good I just can't figure out what flavor it was, wasn't too sweet or spicy but it was good - the cashier told me she'd tell me what kind they were when I come back, so I will update my review then.  Now normally I have to tell Wingstop how to cook my wings, double check my order before I leave and sometimes have them remake them because they're not prepared as I asked. Not these wings, my wings were cooked to perfection, they were crispy, meaty and sauced just right. My only complaint would probably be that they're not open late but my greedy ass shouldn't be eating late anyway lol.  My search for the perfect wings is over and this considering this place is less than a mile from me, I couldn't be more pleased.",

Went back for the ATL spicy sauced wings and they were great. I have to get 10 more to go. The down side was the paper towel holders. Only 3 in the whole place and you have to pass them around. Get 1 per table please. Regular French fries were a good sized order but again just a little too much salt but had a sweet kick to them. If you like kool aid they have it, but was like a glass of instant diabetes. Gross just because you had it when you grew up doesn't mean you need it as an adult. Plus they gotta work on the drink prices. $2.50 for a 20 oz cup is a joke. tatted up counter girl was pleasant. Definitely my #1 wing spot for now and for sure in Glendale!",

She rolled her eyes at me and look down at the phone and hung it up. She had been sitting there looking disinterested taking orders and had me on hold over 10 minutes. I thought maybe they were really busy but they're were only two customers in front of me when I got there. After she took my order and I asked her how long the wait time for the to go food she replied with an huge attitude I really don't know and rolled her eyes. The wings are good but the rude customer service is starting to make it not worth it. Two stars for good food and the food coming out quickly.",

I have tried their mango habanero, extreme mango habanero and their spicy ATL signature dry rub(its not really dry though).  Their spicy ATL sauce is definitely the winner. It packs so much flavor that you keep dragging the wings in the aluminum tray to get more sauce. Lol  If its your fist time try them on Tuesday when they have their special. That way you can try different ones and at lower cost.",

Or maybe she truly just has an attitude problem but as soon as my husband and I arrived, she left to the back.   We would've ordered, got our food, and left however, we stood there long enough to hear 2 people yell \"We have customers!\" The first time it was yelled, we could hear people laughing. Then someone came and said they would be right with us. Then a second time it was yelled. Out walks Lynn. A very unhappy and borderline rude Lynn  who felt the need to make it clear our order was to go.   I ordered the traditional honey mustard wings and they were meaty and delicious.

The service was good, friendly, family business feel, even the kids work! The  sauce was amazing! Kool-Aid fountain drinks! Unfortunately the ATL fries didn't seem as good as the ones their other location. I got the boneless wings which was a mistake, they were literally the smallest Wings I've ever eatin, like small chicken nuggets. I probably won't go back to this location but I'm still a fan of ATL wings!",

I called in my order and (Saless/April) was eating while taking my order.  When I said I tell everything she advised that I would be found in the ditch.  I laughed however, poor poor customer service.  she had no clue if this was my first experience or what.  That was very unprofessional.  I work in customer service every day and this is unacceptable.  I try to support Black establishments however if this is the service I will receive then unfortunately I cannot on principle support this establishment.  We can and we must do better!!!",

The fries were good and the donuts, if that's what you call them, was just ok. The wings were not crunchy on the outside, but cooked. The sauce was just ok.   So, to give OUR community another chance, to redeem themselves we went back earlier this week and again and my opinion is the same...just ok. The cashier was cordial and accommodating, but NOT as friendly as the establishment appears to portray. She also seemed hurried when taking our order. I almost cancelled my order because she made me feel like I was bothering her when trying to decide on what flavors I wanted.   On the bright side, the place was clean, inviting, and welcoming and bright. I loved the music and instantly starting dancing like no one was watching.lol I'm a great dancer!  I would actually give them one more try, but go at the beginning of lunch and ask for the wings to be fried hard and maybe then the skin will have some crunch. I give them A for effort.",

They kept hanging up on me, and there was no way to order online, so since ATL had been recommended to me by my guy at LoLos, I thought I'd give them a try. I called the store on 51st and Northern and spoke to a nice female employee, who promptly told me she could take my 85 wing order with no problem, and have it ready at the time I requested it. She was very helpful in recommending different flavors and sides including the biscuits. When we picked them up, not only were they ready, but they gave us a jug of grape Koolaid. The wing flavors we tried were Lemon Pepper, Cajun Hot, Medium, ATL style and honey bbq AND they were all amazing!!! I will definitely be back to ATL !!",

    "text": "This place is great, however the last time I came to get food they took abnormally long to get the food out. It took 40 minutes for me to get my 12 piece BONELESS wings with fries. I would understand a little more if the wings were bone in, but even that is still not a good excuse for a 40 minute wait time. The restaurant was moderately full but it was not packed with people. So I could understand an extra 5 minute wait on top of the 15 minute average. This is also not the only time I was stuck waiting around 40 minutes, this has happened 3 other times all consecutively. Other than that the food itself is good, I just wish they would be faster with getting their food out.",

While your standing in line you catch yourself dancing, they always play the best music(r&b and love songs) you get up and you get to choose from the best flavors. My favorite is the chefs special, very flavorful with the right amount of kick. My fiance favorite flavor is the lucky sweet red, very flavorful(not an overwhelming taste of sweetness) with just a kiss of spice. Very happy this place can cater to your orders(they let you choose if you want a mixture of wings or flat or if you just want all flats or all wings) very affordable and very delicious  ohhhh and your worst mistake is NOT GETTING THERE FRENCH FRIES! ATL style! There delicious food and atmosphere is what keeps me coming back!",

ATL has many flavors to choose from but I've only tried the ATL rub,  the spicy ATL rub and the buffalo sauce which were all delicious and full of flavor.    A couple things to keep in mind: they have kool-aid on tap,  if you place an order over the phone you have to prepay,  and once you try their wings you might get addicted.",

The honey biscuits were one of the greatest things I've tasted on my trip here. And how can you go wrong with a place that has a Kool-Aid fountain?",

Some locations (SOUTHERN AVE) refuse to take your call in order unless you pay with your credit card or they will wait until you drive there to place your order. What's the purpose of having call in orders but you wont answer your phone to take the order? Other location (THOMAS AVE) will take your order but when you drive there you find out they RAN OUT OF CHICKEN and are waiting on the truck to deliver more...?? WTH this Happened 2 different times at THOMAS location. So TODAY I called in (NORTHERN AVE) to place 2 SEPARATE orders for 2 different people after holding 3 minutes to place order ( we dont want to WAIT FOREVER when we're on lunch especially when we're driving 20 minutes to this location) was told one of use has to pay .89 cents EXTRA for ranch even though their website says All wings served with a side of dressing and NEVER have I experienced this before! Lost a customer I've had it with them!!!",

Regardless, I walked up to the guy behind the counter, and he didn't acknowledge me AT ALL-he just picked up his shit with a pissy attitude and moved away from me and went back to whatever he was doing on the other side of the counter... ok? So I waited for the patron being helped by the girl at the next register. She looked at me like I was a piece of shit. Barely making eye contact  \"What do you want?\" with a really gross tone in her voice. I'm so confused! I ordered 2 large drinks to go.. she told me the amount before she handed me the cups(which I get. Can't risk someone stealing cups) I gave her my card, she swiped it and tossed it on the counter in front of me. Rude. WTF? So I paid $6.37 for 2 \"large\" drinks that were the size of a Jack-in-the-Box medium and got treated like I was a piece of shit. Now,  I'm a bit pissed because I don't treat people that way and I was nothing but kind and patient with a polite smile. I couldn't figure it out. so I went to the drink station and got the unsweetened tea, filled my cups and couldn't locate the straws.. I went to ask the girl behind the counter and she swiftly turned her back on me and ignored me... I know she heard me. I drop my arms in disbelief. At this point all I can think is \"Is this because I'm not brown? Is it because I'm not black?? What could I POSSIBLY have done to be treated this way??\"  Just then there was another employee coming out of the back and saw me looking lost, so she asked very kindly if I needed something. I told her I was looking for the straws, she pointed them out. She was the only one there that seemed to give a shit. I grabbed 2 straws and left. I go back to the car where my husband and son are waiting and they can tell I'm visibly shook. I tell my husband what I experienced as he is taking a drink of the tea and he pulls a face. I try my tea and IT TASTES LIKE A FUCKING FISH TANK!!  I was so pissed by this point and everything was just so beyond belief for me. I dumped that shit in their parking lot. I should have dumped it on their fucking floor.  TL;DR  Rude and prejudice staff, nasty smell, overpriced and dirty. Tea tasted like how a fish tank smells. All The Love, my ass.. rude and trashy.",

    "text": "To whom it may concern, I have had the worst experience at this establishment that I have ever encountered in any restaurant/ fast food facility. I was disrespected by employees, there was no one I could speak to on site in a position to assist me, and when I asked to speak to a manager they said no. I had bought dinner for my family and when I got home I realized that 1/4 of my order was missing. I called the store as soon as I realized and was asked to bring all of the food back in order to receive what was missing. I explained that I had already distributed the food out to my family and was unable to come back with the order. I was told that there wasn't any way to get the missing part of my order without doing so and was hung up on. So, I had to take all the plates away from my family and repackage the wings and drive another 20 minutes to go back to the store so i can get the additional part of my order. I get back to the store and ask to speak to a manager but there was not one on site. I spoke with the woman who packaged up my order and explained to her the situation and asked to have my order remade because now it was cold from having to drive home and back in order to pick up an order that i had already paid for but was missing. I was told that they could only replace the wings that were missing. I then proceeded to ask for my money for the entire order to be returned to me since i returned the cold wings and did not want to eat cold food. I feel that i spent 40 dollars at this establishment and it was not my fault that i was missing part of my order why should i have to eat cold food because of someone else's mistake? I understand mistakes happen and i expressed that but there was no reason why my order should not have been reimbursed or cooked fresh food for the huge inconvenience. Apparently the owner was called on site by the owners daughter and she laughed in my face when i asked to speak to the manager. They were very unprofessional and rude. I was forced to take the cold wings i no longer wanted because they wouldn't reimburse me. I have been a newly frequent customer because of great experiences I had at this establishment in the past. I have even promoted your business by word of mouth and brought other new customers to the store. This entire situation could have been avoided if any kind of good customer service was used. My only issue is that I did not want to serve cold food to my family and and there was nothing that was done to prevent that when it was not my fault that the order was not bagged correctly causing a huge inconvenience for me.  My friend just experienced this today and to think we were going to try this out this weekend with a party of 10......Not now!",

    "text": "I have been to ATL wings 4 times so far, and each time I feel that the cooks are very consistent with their recipe. I've had both their bone-in and boneless wings.   I am a fan of the bone-in ATL rub wings. Made crispy yet juicy, just the way i like them. I can not say the same for the boneless, to me they feel like chicken nuggets dipped in sauce, ad that is why I do not give it 5 stars :(   Their ATL season fries are pretty delish! especially while you dip in the hot sauce or the ranch, or in both!   The front lady is such a sweetheart, she's always so busy but manages to take care of the people ordering and also i seen her go in the back and help out the cooks.   Bottom line is ... You bet I recommend this place!!",

Every time I've been there the cashiers seem like they don't want to be there. This last weekend the two young girls working the front were complaining about the customers that came in after us. They were complaining that they better not be dine in because they have things to do. That they don't want to be stuck at work after 9pm. This was around 8pm. A young guy came out from the back cussing left and right in front of all the customers and complaining they  better have Easter off. This went on for several minutes before the manager came out to tell all 3 something. Very unprofessional staff that need to be retrained or let go.",

    "text": "This location has suffered with the hopes and dreams of other restaurants before but I'm thinking Atl (short for Atl Georgia!) Wings might be here to stay. If you like wings then you will not be disappointed with an eclectic variety of sauces and dry rubs to choose from. The chef in the back was on point using his clock to ensure he didn't burn our order. In addition the food comes out quick so you shouldn't be waiting more than 5-7 minutes to get your food once you've ordered. The staff was extremely friendly and they offered us samples (I had to take a rain check on those biscuits but I shall return like MacArthur) in addition they changed the channel from Shrek 6 to ESPN so I could watch a little Euro Cup. The highlight of my experience was trying all three varieties of Kool-Aid on tap including red, blue and purple. After my sugar coma was complete I definitely left with a mild case of diabetes. It's not health food being served so if you are preparing for swimming suit season then this is not the place for you. I think Atl wings might be the cure for that Saturday night hangover I will be nursing next weekend.",

They immediately recognized me and seemed genuinely excited I was back.  Now for the wings; their signature dry rub is the only dry rub I have ever enjoyed, it was on point and absolutely delicious.  The sweet red is perfect sweet and hot sauce, I like the fact that the sweet doesn't over power the hot like most \"Honey Hots\" do. The Hot Sauce is solid and the wings themselves are nice and plump not scrawny and sad like many places.   I think I may have found a new place for when I am in the mood for wings only.",

Stopped in to this location to pick up food for my birthday dinner with my family. As soon as I walk in there's clearly a back up in people getting their orders. By the time I got up to order the front cashier was clearly annoyed. I got halfway through my order and she decided to walk away to go fight with a chef. Both using explicit language. Both loud. After probably 3 or 4 minutes another girl came up to finish my order. Super sweet girl. I waited for about 25 minutes to get my food. Brought it back home, and of course, my order isn't correct. Boneless were made traditional style. Normally not a big deal but my dad has issues eating bone in wings. So his meal was fucked. Not to mention they made his \"spicy\" ATL wings so spicy he could barely eat them. Tried calling about 6 times now and it never goes through. How the heck do people even do phone orders in to this store?? Decided to message corporate through the website instead since apparently the store won't be hearing my issues.   Seriously annoyed. I will not be returning to this location. That corner spot rotates into a new small business every few years. Can't wait to see what comes in next. With fighting staff and incorrect orders I can't imagine it'll last much longer. What a joke.",

However, the wings were not fresh. They were quite tough. I don't think I should have to chew on my wings as if they are beef jerky.  The fries were also old but we thought the biscuits were a decent sweet treat.   Normally I would send food back if I'm dissatisfied with it but it was pretty busy and it took FOREVER to get our food to begin with. I wish I had timed the wait to give a better understanding.   I was disappointed in my overall experience.  The place was unkept. Especially the restroom which also didn't have any paper towels.   Most everyone was standing around waiting for food so my family randomly sitting and dining in was very uncomfortable. People were literally standing over us.   They need a waiting area or something idk but right now the situation is not efficient.   Also, employees can stand to behave in a more professional manner. Yelling across the establishment telling customer not to use the entrance as an exit is just not necessary.  I feel like the food has potential with the right cooks but I  will never return.",

Your staff on the other hand needs training in respect and manners as well as professionalism. Your organization has the ability to become one of the best but the lack of training in ethics is going to hold you back. One of your employees was turning the lights off and on (like why??) Who does that in a business. Some were talking to their friends others were talking crap in the kitchen however they were still working and getting the wings cooked. The person taking orders asked them to get me a side of sauce and not one person in the kitchen budged she had to go get it herself. They were putting the chairs up while customers were still coming in. There was a handicapped woman who had to try to get into the taller chairs because all of the seats were already put on tables. We did go to another store within the complex they also mentioned how problematic your staff is, they said they are the most disrespectful kids but they love your wings. You need to ensure your business remains successful and that might mean you need to face the fact that your are not throwing a party for teenagers you are running a business.",

Greeted loud and proud, with a Welcome to ATL, followed up by a perfect question of it was our first time. The employee was happy to hear it was our first time and immediately started asking what our likes and dislikes were about Wings then started to offer flavors in which she thought would best suit us. We received a sample of the ATL Style wing which I almost shed a tear from, so crispy and flavorful. I decided to go with the Cajun BBQ, my wife chose medium flavor, and my daughter was also impressed with the ATL Style wing she ordered them. We also placed an order of fries along with drinks of course.   Cajun BBQ was definitely Cajun and it kicks I highly recommend it! The ATL style is like a peppery rub with a hint of butter flavors, and medium was medium lol. Thing about these wings though is that they were crispy, juicy and big! The fries had the skins on em and they reminded of the fair!   I'm coming back to try some more flavors and you should too! See you there.",

We had Lemon Pepper, Cajon Hot, Honey BBQ and Chipotle BBQ with 2 orders of ATL fries. The order came out fairly fast, faster than wing stop that's for sure. Fries were fresh and wings were perfect. I like a good sauce coating with a good crunch in the wing. We loved the order. The drink selection is good and the serve kool-aide. Best part is I took the left overs to work for dinner the next night. I shared with a co-worker who also thought the wings were great. The next day and microwave the wing retains its crunch and flavor/freshness. The ladies that were working were very busy keeping the place clean and interacting with the guests. Great environment to eat and relax. I'm very impressed with ATL wings. I will definitely be back, the train for the 4 stars instead of 5 is I wish there was a west valley location.",

My job has allowed me to travel the world, so I know good food when I see and eat it.  OMG, first of all the service was exceptional.  The staff knew their sauces and their stuff.  The chicken was crispy and juicy.  I have never had wings were the rub was spicy, but the heat didn't keep you from eating more.  I couldn't put them down.  There were 4 of us in the party and we were all VERY pleased.

    "text": "Three flat screen monitors show the menu over the ordering counter (I love this!). They specialize in wings, so the menu is fairly limited. This is by design. The theory is rather than offer a ton of variety that is just 'okay,' they want to focus on one main item and do it really well! Therefore, the menu lists just chicken wings (bone-in or boneless), salads, fries, pancakes, biscuits and drinks. That is IT (apart from the ranch or blue cheese dressings/dipping sauces).  They have three different styles of wing - BBQ, HOT WING and DRY RUB. There are several flavor variations you can select under each style. We ordered 10 wings with the ATL dry rub and 10 wings medium. We also ordered two fountain drinks and an order of the biscuits. (Since this review they've added more flavors and we've tried their cheese fries which are AMAZING!!!)   We paid at the counter, they gave us our self-serve drink cups, wrote my name on the receipt, told us to sit anywhere we like and they would bring the food out to us shortly.  The fountain machine is Pepsi (its Coke at the 40th St location, so that's odd) and they also have tea (sweetened and un-sweetened)and three different flavors of Kool-Aid to choose from.  Just finishing filling our drinks and putting the lids and straws on our cups, when our order was being served! (Apparently, they pre-cook the wings about 3/4's of the way, then remove them. When you order, the wings go back in to cook for 3 more minutes, and then they're done! Don't worry, they don't let partially cooked wings sit out all day until you order them. Just like KFC, Popeye's, Church's Chicken and other fast-food chicken restaurants, pre-prepared menu items are 'under a clock.')   We don't like wet, soggy wings. Places that cook them in ovens or broilers often have this undesirable, gummy-like, chicken texture. I like my wings to be firm and a little dry. Let the sauce and my saliva draw out the texture and flavor of the chicken. I have to ask most places to make my wings crispy. But not here. That's the way come out by default and, I'm told, there are some customers who request they cook them even longer! God bless America! :)  I'm happy to report the wings were served piping hot from the fryer and the ATL dry rub tasted better and better the more I ate it. I can't figure out what's in it other than butter. Its a weird taste, but I kinda like it. The medium wings tasted really hot (spicy) but as I ate more them, I guess I started to become numb to it. I think next time mild will be my choice. Some places (native new yorker) consider mild to mean butter-sauce only. Yech. Mild is meant to refer to the HEAT. A butter-sauce does not define MILD-HEAT. A butter-sauce only defines NO HEAT! Anyway, the point is, the mild at ATL means MILD-HEAT (not just butter-sauce).  The biscuits are not what I would call biscuits. They are more like tiny Beignets or two-bite pastries. Just imagine a cinnamon-flavored donut hole, covered with powdered sugar, sitting in a shallow puddle of honey. Sounds good, right? SPOILER ALERT!!! It is!  I only have one minor complaint about this visit. The wings should have been served with celery to help cut the heat and refresh the palette between bites.  The total was $20, which is about right for a lunch for two and we certainly did not leave hungry!  On Tuesdays, you can get sixty-five cent wings if you sign up for their special offers by texting \"ATL\" to 60259.   ATL is not meant to refer to Atlanta (sorry, Atlanta airport!) ATL stands for All The Luv.",

The staff were super friendly and our to go order came out with just a 10 min wait. The wings were perfectly cooked, & all 6 of the sauces I tried were delicious,  even the extreme habanero & toxic, they were the perfect heat level for this spicy eating champion. I would just make one suggestion... to expand their menu, it's not very big. I had to stop somewhere else on my way home to pick up something to go with my wings. But I definitely will be back the next I'm in the mood for just wings.",

We ordered both boneless and bone-in wings.  2 of us loved the bone-in the other liked the boneless.  A little pricey but oh so worth it.  Their chef special sauce is unbelievably good.  The meat is crispy which to me is perfection.  I have eaten a lot of \"steamed\" wings and for me, that's just disgusting.  These will rock your world if you want fantastic wings.  We will be coming back again and again.",

When we walked in the place was slow and we thought what did we get ourself into.  As we approach the counter, we were greeted by a young lady with a smile on her face.  We told her that this was our first time there and what did she recommended.  I told her that I like flavor but not stuff that would come out burning.  She recommended  2 or 3 different flavors from each type (dry rub, bbq, and sauce) the wife asked if she was allowed to mix ranch dry rub and a sauce and they were more than happy to set it up that way.  I tried a sauce that was recommended.  The gal asked if I wanted frys. And I said what kind.  They have normal and seasond Fry's.  I ask if they could be cooked longer to get the chrisp and Bam she set it up that way.  When they came out they were hot and good to go.  At this time the place filled up so I'm guessing we got there just in time.   The wings were full of flavor and not skimpy on the meat on the bones.  The Fry's were awesome and did not need no dipping sauce and 1 order if Fry's is big.  Here is the big kicker.  We had coolaid as out drink right on tap.  All I'm all we are very impressed with the service and food here.  I will be back when I come back into the area.",

Here's how I describe them.  Cover a chicken in herbs and spices, roast it in a pan, then collect all the flavorful drippings in the pan.  Next, fry some wings until golden and crisp, and sauce them with those intense drippings.  I know, thats not how ATL Wings makes their ATL dry rub wings, but thats how they taste to me.  Excellent!!  Next I had the cajun BBQ sauced wings.  Watch out son!  These are vinegary, spicey, and bold.  Still nice and crispy, but covered in a sauce that'll make you slap your grandma. Superb.  You'll want some celery and ranch or bleu cheese as a counter punch.   This is a straight-forward, no frills joint.  They sell wings and thats about all.  If you like perfect wings, this is the place for you.  Cheers!",

That's how you know a place is great. 1st time there they gave me a sample and that's when I decided I'm going to try everything on the menu. Last time I got 1 order of biscuits and that was a mistake. I need like 10. 1st time was a couple months ago and I've been there several times since and just happen to be craving it now, so decided to write the review. The staff is fun and always excited to help you. The wings are the best in the valley, I especially like their ATL wings. Hands down favorite wing spot ever!",

Treat your customers bad and that's bad business. Simply \"treat others the way you'd like to be treated.\" I asked a simple question to the girl and she replied so rude. Then I picked up my food from the counter, I say thank you and she rudely says \"go out that door\" I just know there's no there's no reason for all the rudeness. I'm supporting a business that doesn't care about the people who keep it",

I requested an order of Hot Lemon Pepper wings and they were batched up with no problem. The staff is always smiling and to get 24 wings the price isn't bad. When I'm in for a craving from the tin of flavors on the menu, or just for a cup of sweet kool aid this will be my ultimate go to place!",

Hot, crispy, big and full of flavor made to order. The people from the counter to the cooks to the ones cleaning tables are friendly & nice even when busy. And they keep the place clean-no greasy tables here! We tried both lemon pepper and medium spiced wings. The first hot crispy bite brought me straight to my happy place, and every bite after confirmed it. They know what they're doing and they do it well. Ranch & blue cheese dips are fresh & homemade-a perfect compliment to the tang & the spice. I love you ATL Wings, you are my new happy place!!",

Just greasy potatoes they've left out for a while.   The cooks are pretty friendly, the cashiers are pretty friendly too - but the older black lady not sure what her name is always messes up my order . Literally every single time. And they have a bad habit of not answering phone calls on Sunday's for some reason ....overall good place ! I def go back like every other week haha.  Ask for the punch card!!!",

I felt welcomed from the minute I walked in the door and service was great. I ordered 6 wings and they were nice enough to let me try two sauces. I got 3 garlic Parmesan wings and 3 ATL rub wings. I then ordered a small fry ATL style. The food was so delicious. The wings were crispy and I absolutely loved both sauces (I'm so glad Yelpers steered me in the right direction). The fries with the ATL dry rub seasoning were tasty & def had a zing of spicyness. All and all- being from the East coast, these wings hit the spot. I felt like I was back in Philly. Will be back... a lot... ASAP",

The selection of flavors is awesome the fries even have different styles. The wings are crispy and juice have plenty of meat. The food is so good that it is usually busy but it doesn't take to long to get your order.   The ATL style fries are the best they are crispy and have so much flavor. If you ask for half ATL and spicy ATL style the two combined work great together (keep in mind its an extra $0.50).  The drink selection is kinda small but they have kool-aid on tap so it wasn't to much of a problem. The menu is well designed so that you can see how much prices are and what you are getting.  I am definitely going to eat here as long as its around. In the end i can recommend this place all the time if anyone wants wings this is the place to go for sure. I have yet to have a problem. Can't wait to go again soon...",

The staff was fast and efficient and the order came out quickly. Bottom line-the wings were great! Special shout out on the chef's special wings-the sauce had a good depth to it and you could see the herbs and spices in it which was unique. Very flavorful-I highly recommend. I also have to say that along with being efficient and friendly, the staff didn't stop moving the entire time we were there. When the two gals there weren't helping customers, they were cleaning the dining room area-why it was spotless. Good first visit-we'll definitely be back.",
