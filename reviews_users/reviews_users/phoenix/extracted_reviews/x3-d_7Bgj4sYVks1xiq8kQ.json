I walked up to the person who seemed in charge and had to get his attention as he was more involved with another (yawning) employee. I won't go into any further details but I see the common thread about poor service in all the reviews! I concur.",

    "text": "Indo-Chinese cuisine is pretty popular in India especially in the South India. I've been wondering why there are so few of them here in the US when the Indian diaspora is increasingly south India. If you are expecting the American chinese or real chinese cusine, you will be very disappointed.. but if you know what Indo-Chinese tastes like.. this place is pretty close to what it should be.  Went here with a big group and tried almost everything on the Menu... loved their appetizers, and all their fired rices tasted similar. Their spice level is pretty mild and the sauces that they put on the table are very tasty. I am sure it's not the food you should be eating all the time being deep-fried and all but it's a great guilty pleasure if done once in a while.  The service was good albeit a little slow. The restaurant get packed so, having a reservation definitely helps.",

    "text": "This review is specific to the Scottsdale, AZ location.  According to me, the 5 stars in the review stand for: 1. Ambiance 2. Quality of Food 3. Value of Costumer - Reception and Service 4. Price 5. Value of Time - Waiting and Serving  in whatever order.  The two stars are for Ambiance and Quality of Food. We were not very well treated. And I would like for the management to take a look at their staff's work. I agree, we were late, we reached there only by 9:32 PM and they close by 10:00 PM. We really wanted to have food here and that's the only reason we came all the way from 15 miles. But apparently, their kitchen closes by 9:45 PM. Understandably they didn't want to serve us there. But, they were ready to give us a to-go. Now, we didn't come all the way just to take-out, so we 'requested' them to serve us there. This female, who was talking to us exclaimed - \"Are you guys serious, do you want to do that to the kitchen?\"  I really don't see as to why someone has to react like that. You could have very well told us that it was not possible. When we decided to leave anyway, one of the waitresses came over and told us it was okay to dine in. We sat down. All this happened before 9:45 PM and we placed the order well before they 'claimed' their kitchen closed. After all this drama, we see a group of 4 walk in, no questions asked, they are shown the table. And sitting where we were, I see the lady who was rude to us, enact the whole scene to someone, supposedly the manager for the night. I mean, how uneducated are you? You treat us like we are causing inconvenience and in front of us, you welcome others even after your kitchen is closed. I don't want to play down their service after we placed the order, but the way we were welcomed almost killed our hunger. We are NEVER EVER going to go again. Thanks to all the treatment.   It's interesting how Indians can be mistreated in an Indian Restaurant. We don't want anybody's job to be affected. With that attitude, they are not going to go too far, anyway. May be it's time for some introspection. Believe me, there are many options and you are not the only restaurant. People might forget what you served them, but please remember that they will not forget how you made them feel.",

We had a few daiquiris and margaritas- nothing special there. For appetizer we had the fried chicken wantons. They were deep fried, as hard as rocks, i could taste nothing. We also tried the mixed fried rice, and scjezuan chicken. The rice was not too bad, it was un oily, which i appreciated. The chicken was  good too, reminded me of the Chinese fare i am used to from eastern India:) All in all, the food was ok, the place is a little un managed though. There were folks who were party of 4, seated at a 6 person table, thereby wasting two seats, those could have been pulled out to make a makeshift table,which would have reduced the wait times.",

Out of the two Inchin wins in the food quality and taste and the options. Also it stands out pretty well in terms of the ambience and service.   The pan fried chilli paneer and 'drums of heaven' are the shining stars of the big menu. Schezuan fried rice and cauliflower manchurian fares out pretty decent too.

    "text": "I drove to Inchins on their very first day and without a doubt it was very crowded. I had to leave the place without any dinner because I have a 7 month old son and he would not allow me to wait for a long time. No complains there.  I came back on the upcoming Wednesday and the place had mild traffic. The service was terrific and we were served our food quickly. Service was very good and I commend the place for that. Not too sure how efficiently they would function in extremely high traffic.   Moving on to the food:  1) Not too spicy as you get it in India (but I dont mind that part)  2) Generous portion sizes  3) Good menu choices (vegetarian and non vegetarian)  4) Prices: Not on the modest side. $10 for a starter is a little bit high for me.  5) Additional sauces on the side are a big plus and improve the taste of the food.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who would like to try out something new for a change. But if you expect spicy indianized chinese, this is not for you.  EDIT: Visited this location again. The staff was pleasant as usual, but the food is downright boring. The Chineese bhel was probably fried in used oil and the Chicken manchurian lacked any flavor. Not going back to this place. Boring...yawn!  EDIT 01/13/2017: Somehow I still keep thinking this place has improved, but it keeps getting worse by the day. Read the sauce bottles, as in, when they were manufactured. I had the chilli garlic sauce which was manufactured in Feb 2014 on the table (just a couple of days ago i.e.). Remember the funny Heinz ketchup ad's back in India..these sauces had the same consistency and would not flow in any direction. The point being, they were 200% expired and still were there. Had the honor of tasting Chilli Chicken main entree and guess what, there was no chilli in it. Not even a sliver of chilli hopes. Now I usually dont rant about a place this frequently, but paying 60 bucks for dinner (for 4 dishes) and not getting 1 thing right makes me really frustrated. If you are really craving for some fusion cuisine, try Panda express. They are lot better than this so called restaurant.",

I live in Tempe so it's a little far to go all the time, however, when I have money and I'm in the area that's a great place to go. One of the times was actually bringing my out of town parents there.   The cost is reasonable for what you get. The cooked Tofu is the best I've ever had. I was a strict vegetarian for three years and now are mostly vegetarian but also eat meat. This is a great location to bring a group of friends with different diets. There's plenty for vegetarians, non vegetarians, and there's some fish dishes as well!   I love there sauces that they always have ready on the table. The outdoor patio is great on a cool Arizona night. Totally a place to check out!",

Pan fried potstickers- again expensive($10 I think)  for 6 small rounds with no dipping sauce! They expect us to eat the sauces from the bottles on the tables!  Hakka noodles were good! Nothing spl about it.  Since we came half an hour before the closing time.. everything was wrapped up and the cheque was on the table while we were eating.

I am not an expert on Indian and Chinese cuisine, but this fusion was just very flavorful and tasteful. They have this paneer cheese appetizer and it tastes so savory and the texture is perfect. It's a bit spicy, but I love the heat.   The first time I went, it was a Sunday evening and it was Soo packed and it really affected the service. It was understandable, and it looked like it was taking a toll on our server. But the food really outshined.  The second time I went was the following Tuesday, believe it or not. It was Soo much better and calmer. It was such an enjoyable experience. There was this server who brought the food out and really took his time to set the plates of food down equidistant from all other plates. It was strange, but pleasantly appreciated. The server that took our order was very friendly too and offered really great recommendations. I cannot recall the names if the dishes, but one of my favorites was a fish in a chili cream sauce.   I'll be coming back!",

    "text": "What's today's lesson? Always give the ratings the benefit of the doubt.   Inchin Bamboo Garden has an average of three stars at the time of this review. After having lunch there, I say that's rather accurate.   I wish a raving review was deserving, because their menu looks wonderfully appetizing with the numerous vegetarian options. Five stars for the planning and thought that went into designing the menu. I wanted to order one of everything veggie. The descriptions were THAT good. Unfortunately the dishes were not as flavorful as their descriptions and a few of them were far too oily.   Usually my all time favorite appetizer is spring rolls. There's something about them that makes me want to snack on and on.   IBG's appetizer consisted of: 3 piece crispy spring rolls filled with mixed vegetables (no tofu) for $8. Side sauce wasn't served at first and when I requested some, a lightly sweet starchy gelatin looking sauce was brought out. Yuck! I ate the rolls plain.  There were several dirty bottled sauces on the table but I didn't dare try any of them for fear of lurking bacteria. Shouldn't restaurant workers know they're suppose to wipe down the table condiments??!  The best item: 6 piece vegetable tulips appetizer for $9.  Flaky crunchy shells filled with tangy and spicy mixed vegetables. What a knockout! They were like deconstructed spring rolls that moved on up to the east side into a deluxe apartment in the sky-high-yyy.  Also very delicious was the garnish that topped the   6 piece steamed dumplings for $10.  The hakka noodles were good, but not flavorful and I probably should have requested spicy. Hakka is a thin eggless noodle that tastes like lo mein. It came with shredded vegetables for $12.  Two items that could've been better: 1. Chili bean eggplant with onion and hot bean sauce for $12. Good, but not fantastic. Too bad they didn't drain off some of the oil. 2. Cauliflower manchurian with cilantro, onion, chili, and celery for $12. The seasonings fell flat in this dish and it relied on soy sauce for flavor. This was more oily than the eggplant and gave me a headache.   Two Disappointments: 1. Singing tangy vegetables mixed with tofu for $13. I don't know if they ran out of veggies or what because on the plate with the skewers were rice and fries. FRIES?! On the same platter as rice. Who does that? Also it sat in a pool of brown sauce. 2. Crispy chili potatoes for $9 were supposed to be tangy, spicy, potato strips with scallions. Crispy? Not. Tangy? Not. Spicy? Not.  So a firm 3 stars for IBG.",

    "text": "Gave this place two tries and the food is just not good.  I've had the Chili Chicken, Hakka Noodles, Eggplant, Lamb Momo's and Hot and Sour Soup.  Generally speaking, the food is oily and flavourless.  The noodles were actually better cold (and drenched in sriracha).  The momo's are disgusting.  They are clearly not homemade, even though it says so on their menu.  You can always tell from how waxy the wrappers are.  The filling is so overground it feels like you're eating cat food.  The lamb had an overpowering gamey flavor - usually a sign of bad quality meat.  Also, they were 6 for $10.  This is literally a disgrace to momo's.  The hot and sour soup had SO MUCH black pepper in it.  EW.  HSS is usually flavored with white pepper so you get the heat without that much of the sting.  Also, it's not sour; wtf! Unless you like torturing yourself, don't order this soup.  Honestly, I don't understand the positive reviews.  The food here is really bad.  It's unfortunate because we really don't have any fusion options around here BUT I'd rather eat regular Chinese/Indian than deal with this sad attempt.  Hard pass.",

The most ridiculous part is the money they charge. You'd almost end up paying twice the amount you'd pay in place like Pei-Wei for similar quantity of food.

    "text": "(This restaurant has multiple locations throughout the U.S. This review is specifically for the Inchin's location in Scottsdale, AZ).  I have to admit, I never knew that Indian-style Chinese food was a thing until we ran across Inchin's while searching for a vegetarian-friendly restaurant for our fourth and final night in Scottsdale during our annual Spring Training trip! I'm very pleased to have made its acquaintance, especially as it turns out there's an Inchin's location in Sunnyvale, CA, not too far from our home near Santa Cruz!  We were attracted by the on-line menu, which has clearly marked vegetarian and non-vegetarian listings for each section, from appetizers through entrees, to rice and noodle dishes. I was also attracted by the fact that the restaurant has a full bar, as I do love a drink before dinner, and that's an aspect of dining that a lot of vegetarian-oriented restaurants tend to neglect.  The location in Scottsdale is in a strip shopping center on the northern end of town. When we first arrived we were concerned the restaurant might be closed, as it looked rather dark, but were reassured by the savory smells wafting around the entrance (my husband's first comment was \"something sure smells good!\"). We were there around 7 p.m. on a Wednesday evening, so the restaurant wasn't very crowded, and we were seated right away.  The dining room is very attractive: sleek and modern, with an emphasis on darker colors (Which may be why the place looked dark from outside. It was well-lighted inside). I have a feeling it might get noisy when it's very crowded, but it was quiet enough on the night we were there.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable, and helped us make informed choices from the extensive and mostly unfamiliar menu. We decided on spring rolls for an appetizer, with Szechuan Fried Rice (fiery) and Manchurian Cauliflower (mild) for our main dishes. I got my cocktail -- a HUGE Black Russian that was served in a water glass (generous bartender!) -- and my husband got his usual iced tea (guess who drove home that night!)  Our food came out of the kitchen quickly (I don't think we waited more than 10 minutes after ordering, if that). The spring rolls were lovely, and we especially liked the slightly tangy sauce that came with them (a change from the usual plum sauce). This dish was perfectly sized as an appetizer for two (might suit for three people, if they have light appetites, but for four or more you'd definitely want multiple orders). The two entree dishes, however, were quite generously sized (in fact, we ended up taking some of both back to the hotel and eating them for breakfast before heading out for Flagstaff the next morning!). I especially loved the fried rice, which was enthusiastically spicy, and so flavorful I could barely stop eating it (\"just one more bite!\"). The cauliflower was delicious too...nicely caramelized, with a good, garlicky flavor, and served with fragrant basmati rice.  All in all, a truly excellent introduction to a new culinary genre for us! Can't wait to try the location in Sunnyvale (and we'll definitely be back to this location next time we're in Scottsdale!)",

We chalked it up to them being terribly understaffed but by the sounds of all of the reviews, that's their typical MO. We waited to be seated, we waited for drink order to be taken and received (and although they have a full bar they don't make any drinks - including a simple martini- that aren't on the menu!?)- and needless to say, we waited for our food. When the lettuce wrap appetizer finally arrived, so did my husband's main course. Mine came 15 minutes later. We actually liked the food - and the server was kind and so apologetic for all of the service 'misses' - but we won't be back. Nearly two hours for a simple Asian meal is crazy! And if all of that wasn't enough, we saw a 'Larry the cable guy' type of customer use his TEETH to unscrew a stubborn lid on a table sauce bottle!!! Another review said a family changed a diaper on a table? What's going on here?? Do customers check their common sense and manners at the door?? Ugh ...",

Love that they appeal to all types of diets.   Appetizer: Corn Soup and Chinese Behl Both were delicious, but I wish the behl was spicier. I was impressed how long the behl stayed crispy.   Dinner: Hakka Noodles and Manchurian The noodles were just as I expected, but were too bland for my taste. I was completely disappointed in the Manchurian. It was soggy and had no flavor.   TIP: If you like very flavorful and spicy food look for items on the menu that are \"tangy.\"  Overall, I'm sure there are hidden gems on their menu because the restaurant smelled phenomenal. I would give this restaurant a second change if I was in the area, but not go out of my way for.",

Perhaps it's bc it was take out or perhaps high expectations that this must be the best Chinese food I'm ever going to have because I've never heard of 7 Chinese dishes in small boxes enough for one European serving costing $187.  However, what I found offensive is that I asked if I had everything to complete my order and they verified but when I got home there wasn't any sauces and they gave me 4 fortune cookies. It's just odd that you can go to any other Chinese food establishment and you get two meals and they send you home with 12 fortune cookies & a fresh orange, yet this extravagant place is so cheap they give you 4 fortune cookies and no condiments, not even orange sauce for the spring rolls. Come on, that's what makes these tasteless cabbage fried sticks taste like anything haha. Definitely not recommended.",

Food was good! So why one star.... the service was horrible... so slow And it wasn't crowded.... alSo 4 drinks on happy hour turned out to cost 40 dollars!!!!!!!!  Apparently during happy hour a glass of wine is on sale for 10 bucks and if that's half off that means it's normally 20 bucks.... what a joke!!!  All in all this tasty meal cost 90 bucks!!!

The food was cold and barely had any flavor despite the menu describing the items as spicy. The appetizer was very expensive: it consisted of sauteed onions and hard dumplings. We were too hungry to complain after a long day of work. First time we came we experienced the same thing but we thought of giving them another chance. Clearly it was the worst choice for a Friday evening.  The table next to us complained about the food being cold as well, at least they had the patience to send the food back (the server gave them the worst look). NEVER coming back here again.  The only good thing about the meal was refresh wet towelette and the green sauce in the pic below.",

I came to my first YEE tonight, service was wonderful food was awesome, nice family sized traditional plates. Drinks are amazing the menu is definitely fantastic. The food is a mix of Indian, Asian - inspired dishes like thai, Chinese etc. definitely get the Thai and Indian spice vibes which I loved of course. Started off with the appetizers really good chicken, there a spicy shrimp and the vegan and vegetarian options as wells. Everything is moderately priced as if you are in a group so definitely don't come alone and if you do come with an appetite, or I mean you can always leave with a bag of delicious leftovers! The dessert was really different but it wasn't it was very and slightly sweet if that makes sense but I loved it topped it off to a great night! So definitely if you're in the area come check it out in North Scottsdale, but for me I'll if it's a special night or I want to take my date here for a rewarding dinner of that sort, but other than that it's a very nice spot in Scottsdale! Good job guys stay hungry Phoenix.",

There was no hostess. We waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Once we were seated, no one greeted us and just kept passing by us. Yeah, I mean no one took our drink order. Finally, we had to flag a waiter and yell at them that no one even approached our table. Only then did they stop to even take an order. The water at the tables is lukewarm. The bottle they are in appeared dirty. For as nice as the restaurant appeared in terms of decor, they really should invest in a hostess and about 3 more waiters and teach them basic service etiquette.  The food is decent in my opinion. It's good but nothing noteworthy. I've had better Indian Chinese in other parts of the Valley. If the service was better, I would have considered back here. But with the lousy service, I don't recommend dining here. If you are go to dine, I recommend a few things. Bring bottles of cold water. Based on my experience, I think there is a good chance your water and drinks will not be refilled. Our water was never refilled, not once!! Also any drink they bring you will be served lukewarm. Asking for ice was like asking for gold; it's a rare commodity here in my opinion and when they brought ice in drinks, there was hardly any in the glass. Dress lightly and bring some hand held fans. The restaurant was very warm and the ventilation was poor imho. This was winter, I hate to imagine what it's like in the summer here. Arrive here with the mentality that you are in Russia circa 1980's. Expect long waits! Maybe have a few alcoholic drinks prior to arriving here to mellow you out cuz you will be frustrated.",

Two of the sauces tasted identical.  Eggplant was good, but there were only few pieces and it was smothered in dark sauces.  Not sure why all are so soupy?    Reading from all the reviews here, I wonder if I went to the same Inchin's Bamboo Garden?  What's Indo-Chinese?  I went in with open mind to try new cuisine, may be Indo-Chinese isn't for me.  May try again, though.  Sunny Az",

We went in to order take out, there was two families sitting down other than that the restaurant was empty and it started getting busier after about 30 min. We had six people and did three separate orders.  It took over an hour to get one order. They offered one of the three orders free drinks to make up for the time but didnt care to offer to any of the other two.  When we finally got home to dig in and enjoy our food to find 10 plastic forks and four spoons, no fortune cookie or sauces in my order but the others had them.  Once we started eating we came to find our meals had no favor, sweet or spicy. Only the mongolian beef was eatable everything else we ended up throwing out.(ordered egg drop soup, mango chicken, mongolian beef, and chicken fried rice)",

We used to to try this place once a place around that time and it was ok back then.  Service: The person who takes order uses a 1x1 sticky note or note pad and write down the order eventually confusing himself and the ones who is placing order. We ended up getting wrong and missing dishes afterwards.   We asked if we can use the private area which was already vacant since we are a big party. They told the group need to have 10adults to use that. We were 14 with 8 adults and 6 kids. Good logic?!!  The guy who brings food is apparently very rude, he don't like us telling him where to keep the food on table and strike back with his arrogant comments. He is also busy flirting with the bar attendant, not that I am against it but when you do it during your service time in a very visible manner to the customers, it does matter.  The food!! Everything tasted same. Probably poured same sauce on all dishes we ordered. The schezwan fried rice is not even close to schezwan! Please check on what the chef is doing at kitchen.",

I can honestly see why some people have an issue with the service here, but I can also see that at least of the servers are trying.  They have a designated vegan menu, you just have to ask for it, if interested.   I enjoyed their noodle dishes, but they, alone, never seem to satisfy. I always end up adding something to the dish. For example, I added the curry to the Hakka noodles and the result was delicious.   I was disappointed in the Gobi Manchurian. Every Gobi Manchurian dish that I have ever had has been a red color and full of spice. Theirs is a brown gravy, soupy dish. I did not enjoy it.  The Garlic Green Beans and Crispy Chili Potatoes are both excellent! The green beans are cooked perfectly, not too raw, not overcooked. However, it is a small portion of beans for the charge of a whopping $12! This is a $6-$8 dish, tops! Shame on them.   There are no vegan dessert options. Boo.   I agree that service can be iffy. There is one employee in particular who appears to be really trying; she puts forth an effort and it shows. Another employee, not so much.  The restaurant is hidden behind the CPK off of N Scottsdale Rd, near Shea, and cannot really be seen from the road. This may be a hinderance in attracting customers. Inside is large, warm, and spacious. They sell their sauces buy the bottle, along with some natural fruit juices. They are closed from 2:30pm-5:30pm, M-F, so sometimes they miss out on my business when I don't want to wait an hour for them to re-open.",

Any One who has ever had Indian-Chinese in India can understand how wonderful it feels when you find the taste of Calcutta in a restaurant in Arizona.  I would like to congratulate the minds behind this concept.A restaurant that caters only to fusion Asian cuisine is truly a bold move. This place makes me a little less homesick and judging by how full it is on a Monday evening further validates the fact that Food truly transcends all boundaries. Me and my husband have been aching for some Indian-Chinese lately and it did satisfy our cravings. We got Fried Rice,Chili garlic noodles,Vegetable Manchurian,Pan fried chili paneer (cottage cheese) to-go. My order was ready in about 15 minutes.  The only thing i would say is that the place is a little pricey compared to other Indian restaurants as my total was $50.Any how i'm going to frequent this place and look forward to trying all the items on their menu.

    "text": "We were already heading pretty far north in Scottsdale so we thought we would make a venture out to Inchin Bamboo Garden for dinner. We received very attentive service when we arrived (there weren't too many people) and also throughout our meal as it started getting busier. They offer a happy hour special during the weekdays of buy one appetizer & one drink and get half off on both, so we started off with a Mango Mojito, a Pina Colada, Crispy Chili Baby Corn, and Chicken 65. My mom and I both enjoyed our drinks and preferred the Chicken 65 appetizer, however my fiance was a big fan of the Crispy Chili Baby Corn. While the Chinese Bhel was not part of their happy hour special, my mom wanted to try it out. It looked very tasty when it came to our table, however was lacking flavor. There were some sauces on the table which we added to the bhel that made it a little bit better, however we all agreed we could have passed on that.  My mom and I were actually very full after the appetizers but decided to get a main dish for the three of us to share. The Chicken Manchurian was my fiance's pick and we all had high expectations since the chicken appetizer was really good. We got the entree gravy based (versus getting the dry version), but it was underwhelming so we actually asked if they would make us the dry version instead. This one was a bit better however it was lacking salt. The manager was gracious enough to try to make things right by getting us another entree so we appreciated it.  They have a fairly large menu of non-vegetarian, vegetarian, and even vegan options (upon request). Overall, because the happy hour special was a good deal and the appetizers were the best part of our dinner, I'd be willing to go back.",

Over all, wouldn't order again, I actually could get something WAY better for 67 bucks lol.",

Even Kids French Fries took 40mins inspite asking for a hungry kid.  Food was also not good as it was before, the quality has been ON&OFF and this time it was way OFF. In past have suggested this restaurant to my friends and even today had a friend, felt really bad for wasting his time as well.  It was very clear the staff were not good to keep track of orders placed and what had been delivered! Literally every table complained and few if I am not wrong cancelled their orders.  Hope the management takes appropriate steps to get better staff in place for making the dining worth the money and time.",

I have loved my Scottsdale dining experience until now.. this was HORRIBLE.  I see a night or two hanging over the toilet in my neat future :( One last issue.  If your child prefers chicken nuggets for dinner.. go to McDonald's first because that's what they serve there... True story!",

At least there are some interesting choices and the food is pretty tasty.  A bit heavy handed on the salt or soy I think, but some good flavors.  I chose the hottest dished available, and they were still not very hot for me, but I could add some of the table sauces and that did it.  My hsb likes blander dishes like the stir fried beef.  The chicken and beef were good quality, not grisly like some places.  Our service was fine, we had a really pretty Indian-American girl who was on the ball.  The place was 1/2 full Saturday when we came in at 7:30 then really got busier.  Most of the patrons were ethnic which isalways a good sign.  But most appeared to be of Indian heritageor that neighborhood, not Asian.  Anyhow, we'll try it again.  There is really slim pickings wth this type of food here.",

American restaurants are very upfront about waiting time and solid about reservations, but Inchin on weekends? Not so much. I'm not sure if it is because they are brand new and trying to build a customer base or if it's a management problem. Either way, they should fix it soon because THEIR FOOD!  OMG! I think the Indo-Chinese food at Inchin might even be better than some that I have had in India. It was so good that we didn't even mind the can-be-better service. It was worth every minute of our wait. We got Veg Manchurian, Chili Chicken, Hakka Noodles and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, and LOVED IT! In fact, we went this past Friday and I'm already craving their food. We might go back this weekend.  The place is worth checking out. If you are not up for a wait on a weekend, go on a weekday, but do go. Also, do let them know about the spice levels, just in case. Our food was spicy but we were okay with that.",

Firstly, the ambiance is definitely worth mentioning. I wasn't dining in and so cannot comment on the service, but the lady who took my order was very courteous and welcoming. They even accepted my yelp coupon and gave me a 10% discount. The food (dinner order of a starter, rice and curry) was sufficient for 2 people easily. The starter (chicken 65) was excellent. The rice too was pretty spicy and good. The chicken curry (I guess it was chilly chicken) could have been better. The pricing was definitely not cheap, but again wasn't too expensive either. So, considering I have this place less than a mile away from home, I don't think I have any complaints.",

The ambience is very nice and the decor is classy and the place is kept very neat and tidy. The staff was very friendly and attended to our needs.   There sure was a faster response time when it was less crowded during the weekday lunch compared to the fully packed weekend evening. Nonetheless, we were blown away by the food when it came. My favourites were the Chicken 65 and the Paneer in the Appetizers section. There were enough quantities and the presentation and the taste were excellent. I would definitely eat from here again on my next visit.",

    "text": "I had a pretty bad experience here recently. This has been one of my favorite Chinese place till recently, but looks like the popularity and patronage from Asian clientele has gone to their head. Went there on a Sat afternoon, thinking that there would be less of a crowd to sit through,and was surprised at the level of mismanagement this place has. To start off, while the place was mostly unoccupied, i did book a table in advance just to be sure. As soon as i entered, i could figure out the place was not completely ready though it was already 130pm, a good couple of hrs from their opening time. Booking didnt seem to make any difference as the restaurant crew were not interested to know if i had one! The Air conditioning sucked like anything. With peak summer temp of 115F outside, the least you expect from an eating place is a breath of cool air. But probably the Bamboo garden folks were trying to save some $$ on their power bill. The food preparation tasted Ok but the presentation was bad. And for some reason, the staff seemed to be in a hurry to wrap up the table and make us move out. Dishes were being removed while some of us were still eating, tables were moved while we were still sitting. It felt as if the management would be happier if people paid upfront, boxed all stuff and went off quickly. To top it off, my bill included a 18% gratuity for a party of 6...which included 2 kids...1 being infant!!..Ridiculous!. This place is definitely avoidable now and out of my list of favorite places for food.",

    "text": "I absolutely hate writing negative reviews but I have to share my experience. If I would've read these reviews first, I would never have walked in. And if you scroll to the bottom of the review page, you can see \"Not recomended reviews\" which are not factored in to their overall low 3 star rating. The ones I saw were all 1 star reviews. Wouldn't be surprised if mine landed there as well.  Not good. I went for a quick lunch and they told me they only had buffet. Ok, I'll try it. First, food was either flavorless or spicy but nothing tasted \"right\". They offered two soups, a sweet corn and a hot & sour, the hot and sour was a little spicy but no flavor as you would expect based strictly on the name and what we all know as hot & sour. The corn soup looked like snot with canned corn in it and smelled similar as well. The offerings were veg fried rice, chicken fried rice, chili chicken, some other chicken, stir fried tofu a noodle dish and some sweets for desert. All dishes were basically the same - a protein with carrots, onion and bell peppers.  Not many options to choose from, everything tastes the same, temp was outside of food safety standards and on the cool side. Service was horrible. I guess I have to go up to the bartender to collect my bill...a server came up and didn't know how to use the POS to print my check, the bartender introduced himself \"hi I'm Steve\" he wasn't even looking at me so I didn't know he was talking to me. Himself and the other servers then began to laugh and speak Spanish to each other as if I wasn't even waiting for service so I can pay and hightail it out of there. There was ONE other person in there during lunch. I should've taken that as my sign to turn around and head back to my car. All in all, a horrible experience and terrible food.",

When quizzed about it after the long time,  they kept insisting it's coming in ten minutes though they totally forgot. They were forced to go home hungry with to go boxes and having eaten nothing. The waitresses brought incorrect items to our table and thought it's a joke or cute to barely not being able to pronounce names of order items and keep saying I don't know did you order this? Food tastes very bad except an appetizer or too. Chicken biriyani was a sorry  dry mess having brown mushed up rice.  dry as hell. and boiled chicken with no spices.  Another thing to watch out for is you'll have to wait endlessly for the food. They are not able to split transactions beyond 6,  forcing all of us to pay cash.",

Next $7 for 3 tasteless quarter sized potstickers that were deep fried rather than the expected quick pan frying and no dipping sauce.  The kicker was the vodka soda I ordered while I waited for my order, Costco Kirkland vodka rather than Tito's.

The server who finally took our order for starter did not bother  to inform us about soup portions, so we ended up ordering less than required.  Soup was hot water with salt and pepper, nothing more. Crispy corn starter was pasty and disgusting.  After an interminable wait our entree order was taken by a different  serve ( the first one never bothered  to come back). Diced chicken in black bean sauce was salty and disgusting.  Noodles were lumpy and soggy mess. Chilli chicken was tasteless..fried rice was semi cooked..  We have been regular customers at Inchin for more than 3 years. But the stark dip in quality only rivaled by increase in prices have made us lose our appetites for this establishment.

Mind you this place was dead and 3 other tables out of 50.   I waited another 5 minutes for him to take my order. I ordered the Szechuan Beef and I wanted noodles instead of rice. I just wanted to sub rice for noodles. And it was so difficult to order with this guy like I was asking for a bar of gold. So he takes the order. Then comes back and says do you want beef or chicken. I'm like bro, I just want noodles sub instead of rice. So I was so ticked and I just ordered rice and said screw it.   The meal was missing something. So me, myself had to go and get the sauces because the waiter didn't bother offer of get me any. He never checked on me once. The sauces made it better.   The service is garbage.

The service was excellent and our meals were very promptly served.  I recommend the chili crispy chicken honey dish.  It was delicious just as the excellent waitress promised.  The other dish we tried was the Szechuan beef.  It was good, but not great.  We will be back to this place for sure.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.  One suggestion that would help them is to change the menu so it is easier to read and understand.  Pictures would be a great addition to the menu.  Luckily, the waitress we had was thoroughly knowledgable with the menu and she gave us perfect understanding of the various dishes.  She should be commended for that.  I did tell the manager she was exceptional.  Marketing wise, they need to get their name out to local residents.  Coupons via direct mail and email specials should be added to their customer loyalty program, which we signed up for.",

We used to go here very often for last 3 years but today they were overwhelmed with guests full of restaurant and seems short staffed so quality of food and accuracy of food order got compromised. Previous manager Jay is also not there. I thought maybe this is a one time bad experience, but now couple of months later visited again  and it was not busy, later at night but food taste is still questionable especially Hot N Sour soup was watery, Hakka noodles were like a thick blob, Gobhi Manchurian was all watery, Devils Choice Vegetables was little better, too much vinegar in Chinese Behl, chili fried paneer and burnt garlic rice were good. We used to enjoy their tray of 6 different kind of Sauces but now they only have 2 diff kinds and that too they don't bring it to your table unless you ask for it. Also they brought out one item at a time to the table, even the plain rice came separate from the curries. The guest WiFi was again not working - I am sure they don't want to offer it but too shy to admit it. Female Mgr was trying to train a newer employee but had a horrible attitude. Kanabar Bhai - please do something. We do not have many Indian Chinese Choices in town.",

Last week I tried the Scottsdale location and was very disappointed. The pot stickers were nothing like the same menu item in Round Rock, these were rock hard dumplings that seemed to have been frozen and heated up. The drums of heaven were just pieces of fried chicken, not the stir-fry sauteed item I was used to from the other location. The two entrees were better but still seemed sort of overcooked and without texture. I was really disappointed after probably 20 visits to the Texas location I assumed this Arizona location would be the same.",

    "text": "Why, why, why do I always have \"bizarre-o\" experiences at restaurants?  I am beginning to think I am cursed! Is it so hard that I receive a balance of good customer service, good food and a nice atmosphere?  Is it too much to ask?  Really?  Read my other reviews and you will understand what I am talking about.  Dismal one and two star ratings, of otherwise highly rated restaurants!  Well, on to this story.............  I normally try to not frequent \"chain\" or \"franchised\" restaurants.  I don't like them.   When I go out and spend money, I want a chef preparing my food, not a cook.  If I want a cook to prepare my food, I will cook it myself - at home.  I am a cook, not a chef..............    I visited Inchin Bamboo Garden on 8/1/2013 with a group of co-workers celebrating a birthday lunch.  The birthday person chose the place.  It was noon and the place was completely empty when our party of 9 arrived.  We chatted a bit and then placed our order.  We all ordered off the lunch menu which included soup, a choice of rice and the entree.  One of my co-workers was worried about the spice level of the black bean sauce in one of the vegetarian dishes and asked if she could have the sauce on the side.  About 15 min after we had all placed our order, the waitress came back and said she could not get the sauce on the side.  Hmmmm, why?  It was just sauce?  So we asked to speak to the manager as we felt this was not an unreasonable request.  The manager, begrudgingly, came over and said they could not serve her black bean sauce on the side because they are a franchise restaurant and they use prepared powdered mixes and it reconstitutes as they cook the dish.  Oh yeah, that sounds yummy!  NOT!  Oh, BTW - That was the LAST time we saw the manager.  About 40 minutes into our wait, still no soup.  Nothing.  Then SOME entrees start coming out.   I got mine, and I said to the waitress, \"Shouldn't the soup come first?\"  She said, \"Yeah, usually\".  Usually?  OK, whatever.  Out of the 9 of us, 5 got entrees AND soup, the other 4 had nothing not even the soup!  One of my co-workers ordered the chicken curry and her teeny, tiny bowl was only a tad over half full.  I will attach a picture.  Yes it was so pathetic I took a picture, the picture time stamp was 12:41 PM - make note of this.  My portion was small, but at least I got my full portion.  I ordered the Sliced Lamb Hot Garlic.  It was ok.  The rice was terrible!  I ordered the fried rice; it was dry, cold and flavorless.  It was like it had been made the day before and thrown onto my plate.  The hot and sour soup was cold on top and smoking hot in the middle.  It was not very good either.  I wanted to eat, I was hungry, but as my 4 other co-workers sat soupless and foodless - I held off.  So we waited, and waited and waited about another 15 minutes.  Finally the waitress brought 3 of 4 soups but still no entrees, one \"lone\" co-worker still sat with nothing.  We all had meetings and had to get back - so we had no choice but to ignore etiquette and start eating.  Then magically, one more lunch was served from the kitchen-which ended up not being what she ordered, but she accepted it anyway.  And then there were three, one co-worker still with no soup OR entree!  We asked the waitress what the heck was going on? The waitress then told us that all our food WAS ready at the same time, but 4 of the 9 entrees were delivered to other tables.  What other tables?  There wasn't anyone else there when we ordered?  There was now ONE other table of people, but did they really have our food?  What was the coincidence of them ordering the same items?  Finally, at 1:03 PM, the last 3 entrees came out from the kitchen-sadly one had to be in a \"to-go\" bag because she had no time to eat because of her meeting and had to get back to work.  The other two co-workers just ate fast.  At the end of this horrible experience, they did comp the 4 missing meals and after asking they took 10 % off my bill - geez thanks.  The waitress made mention that the manager sent her out to us to apologize and to let us know that 4 servers quit that morning and they had to use kitchen staff to help run the food.  Well there were only 2 tables of people TOTAL, how many servers do you need to wait on 2 tables?  There were other people I saw working there doing nothing.  And what about the manager?  Where the heck was he?  Why wasn't he helping?  Never once did he come over to apologize, but instead sent the waitress out to do that for him?  Isn't that HIS job?  All he did was hide in the kitchen.  Truly terrible experience.  Ironically, the girl who had to get the \"to-go\" order and never got any soup, is from Seattle and she says that she used to frequent the franchise located there and said that it was wonderful!  Hard to believe that is True with the comedy of errors at this place!  This is a DO NOT RETURN - DNR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

And Oh I have waited for that in Phoenix for the last 6 years I have been here. I have finally been rewarded.  We had a good dining experience last Friday when we went for dinner. The sweet corn chicken soup, drums of heaven and salt and pepper shrimp were all quite comparable to what you get back home.  For entrees, we had the chicken manchurian, chilli chicken and chilli shrimp. Unfortunately, all of the gravy, while tasty, tasted alike. Would have probably given a 3.5 star due to this but am feeling generous. The burnt garlic fried rice and hakka noodles was very good. They also have their sauces on the table so you can customize as you want. Serving size is decent.  Service and decor is very nice.  TIP!!!  Please make reservations prior to going here, they either overbook on the reservations or are really busy. We walked in without a reservation and had to wait almost 40 minutes to be seated.  Will return whenever the craving hits again.",

And this has all the ingredients: food quality, taste and ambience. Though service could be further improved on, i am still rating it high because of the food taste. I went there once for dinner and was glad to see the mouth watering menu and topping over the cake was that it almost tasted like a good chinese restaurant in India, what else can one hope for! I just loved their spring rolls and chilli chicken. They could further work on their soups though as the hot n sour i ordered had a strong flavor of something that dominated my entire experience which was not that good. Overall, a great place for indo chinese cuisine, if thats what u r looking for. Would definitely want to go again.",

Upon arrival the waitress looked up our order then called over the manager, they whispered to each other then disappeared for about five more minutes. When the manager came back to the front we asked where our food was and he said he thought they had told us, but they had given our order to someone else but not to worry because the called the previous customer and asked him to drive back to the restaurant to return our order. As a customer I would not welcome a call like this and drive back because they made a mistake, they should have simply remade the order. Another 10 minutes goes by and the other customer returns with our food. The manager tells us that the food will be on the house and they will also throw in a soup as well. Through all the wait and lack of communication we would have chalked it up to a bad experience and possibly try it again, but upon arriving home they had given us the completely wrong order anyways. Instead of chicken entrees we had dumplings with \"kung pao chicken\" written on the box. Worst experience we have had at a Chinese restaurant and the food was not even very good.",

I mean all Indians loves the indo-chinese food, it is greasy, it is fried but still we love it. Inchin has a great variety for vegetarians, no problems with food at all. It is yummy. The soups and appetizers are great, the entrees are great too. I mean nobody else is serving this stuff, so of course Inchin has an edge over other Indian restaurants. The portions are big, so you would definitely pack some home for next day..   We have been here 2-3 times. One of which was the new year's eve, too many server girls moving around, we were taken to our seat as we had a reservation, the restaurant was not completely packed as yet, but this lady never returned to us with menus. The girls were just moving around in groups, just chatting away... not looking or going to customer's seats at all to ask them... whatever... I did not see any manager who would at least just tell them what was needed to be done... anyways we got our menus and ordered, the food took forever to come.

You get a full on culinary experience with their a la cart menu items however, they also offer a quick pick-up-and-go lunch buffet from 11:30-2:30 (M-F) and 12-3 (weekends).  From the beautifully fragrant and fresh mango salad to the warm and chocolaty lava cake a la mode, your senses are ignited.  Do NOT forget to try their date wontons, they are life changing!  They taste like chocolate and are dusted with powder sugar on a bed of Chocolate sauce.   They absolutely shine with their thought-out, detailed, and delicious mixed drinks.  Each craft cocktail delineating a very specific flavor profile, offering a beautiful assortment of libations full of personality, balance, and sophistication.  Try the last rose for a delicate and fruity refresher and the rowdy rouster for all the nostalgia of fall.    You. Must. Try their Burnt Garlic Chili fried rice, it's mind blowingly tasty - the perfect blend of spice and flavor!  Other must haves are Chicken 65, Mongolian beef, 5 Spice Lamb, Jalepeno fish, skewered shrimp, spring rolls, and hakka noodles.  They also handmake Szechwan dumplings, Momos dumplings, and potstickers in-house and they are epic!   Their passionate ownership and staff are incredibly attentive and courteous.  Dinning at Inchin Bamboo Garden is unlike anything in the valley.  All guests are in for a culinary treat.  A True hidden gem in Scottsdale and worth a drive from anywhere else in the valley.",

    "text": "I came here per recommendation from my Indian friend for dinner one night. I didn't even know the cuisine called indo Chinese prior to my visit.   Saturday night. If you come early, they weren't busy at all. They started getting busy around 8pm, by 8:30pm they were really packed.  I tried one of their exotic drink. They added smoke to a tea pot to bring out interesting smell and flavor. Drink was Japanese whisky base with earl grey tea. I slowly drunk this cocktail while enjoying the food.  They have extensive drink cocktail menu. Menu is so cute, it looks like a hand written with hand written picture.   I tried everything served. I don't know what we ordered, just let someone else do the ordering as I didn't know anything about the cuisine. I especially liked Indian Cheese dish with chili looking sauce. It wasn't as spicy as I originally thought especially when I ate with rice.  I should have took a picture of the menu so I can remember what I ate.  All the dishes served was quite delicious and portion size was big. I took some leftover home to enjoy them later.  Looking forward to coming back here again to try more different dishes.",

Many items didn't have labels so it was hard to differentiate. Everything was barely warm, not even somewhat hot and almost cold even! What they said was general tso tasted like manchurian. Service was terrible! Waiters didn't wait the tables and just sat in back. I had 3 plates sitting on my table from buffet (plates with food left) and no one picked them up while I ate. No water was poured and when I asked for ice they never brought it. I waited several minutes for someone to come give me my bill and finally got up to go to front desk and finally someone noticed. There were mosquitos and fruit flies all over the table area and bar. I got bitten by mosquitos couple times even. Get pest control! My change was to include some dollar bills and 23 cents but the guy just gave me the bills and no change - who does that? Give exact change and then take your tip. I had this place bookmarked but I removed it while I walked to my car. I can't think of 1 thing I liked from the entire buffet, that's really bad!",

    "text": "This is my first ever yelp review, so bear with me! With that said, please take note of the fact that I decided to finally take the plunge and write a review because of this restaurant!   It is worth mentioning that they are under new management as of about 4 months ago and from my understanding, have made many significant changes.   Let's start with the service. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful during my visit. They were attentive and very knowledgeable on all of the menu offerings. The way the staff speaks about their food and the dishes is actually inspiring. Explanations were heavily detail orientated and the passion they have for what they do truly shines through.  The space itself is beautifully done from the moment you walk in the door; The restaurant decor, artwork to the table setup. Everything in the restaurant was in great condition and very clean. We came for lunch, unknowingly, while their lunch buffet was occurring. Multiple times during my visit I watched as the employees checked on the buffet, ensuring it was clean, trays were full and food was hot!   And for the grand finale, the food!!! You guys, I was not just pleasantly surprised, I was blown away! As was everyone I came with. We opted for an array of a la cart menu items (some of which are offered at the buffet, as well). Again I'm going to talk about detail. The detail and care they put into the ingredients and dishes is incredible.   We were told the mango greens salad was a top seller so we opted for that. It was so fresh, perfectly dressed, and a wonderful combination of ingredients. The Szechwan dumplings (we had the chicken) were simple, yet so flavorful and made in house! The jalapeno fish was breaded to perfection and cooked just right.   As for entrees, the volcano shrimp was delicious!! It can be difficult to find good seafood in the valley, but rest assured, you won't have that issue here. The 5 spice lamb...wow! So tender and perfectly seasoned. The classic Mongolian beef dish did not disappoint.   We also ordered the burnt garlic chili rice and the Hakka noodles. The rice!! Oh the rice. It was beyond delicious and certainly packed a punch. The Hakka noodles were the perfect addition to balance out some of our more spicy dishes. We were also informed that the noodles for this dish are specially made in Vietnam, specifically for this dish. How cool is that? I can honestly say that I would happily order ever single dish I tried, again and again.   We ended our meal with the date wontons with ice cream. This is easily the most creative and interesting dessert I have ever had. The dates, to my surprise, paired so well in the fried wonton with the ice cream. The ice cream was served warm and was used for dipping. It was so good!! I am still in awe at how well this flavor combination worked together to create this dish. It is worth mentioning that the presentation and plating of each dish was so unique and beautifully done.   The overall experience at Inchin Bamboo Garden was incomparable and I cannot wait to go back to this hidden gem.",

But around 8:30 the place started filling up quickly. We ordered masala soda and masala mojito for drinks. Masala soda was really good and the mojito could have had more alcohol in it than just soda.   For food we ordered paratha, chilli chicken dry, cauliflower Manchurian dry, chilli lamb gravy and paneer schezwan. I was eagerly waiting to try cauliflower Manchurian but it was disappointing. There was too much oil and hardly any taste of Manchurian. In fact all the food had a lot of oil used. Chilli lamb gravy and paratha were the only saviors. Paratha was very fresh soft and tasty.   Overall an ok place and not so keen to return any time soon. The price is definitely on a higher side and not worth the value for money.",

Here is why to call it 5 stat restaurant.  1. Finding Indo Chinese is really difficult in US. Especially those who still have Indian street Chinese food taste on tongue crave to find one.  Here is one in Phoenix.  2. Taste? I thought to judge with basic Chinese items as only they can tell how satisfying the taste is. Started with Manchow soup and it the very first sip was Wah  because it was as much as Indian Chinese. I decided to hold my excitement trying American Choosuey. I requested my server if he can ask the chef for sample. The chef was convinced. Guese what!!!  It was damn soooo perfect. Tangy yet spicy and perfect taste of capsicum.  3. You will love the interior and atmosphere. Very romantic atmosphere, very calming and relaxing.  Just go ahead and trt it. Students especially coming from India recently. Here is place for you.",

Also got the Paneer 65, which tasted good overall. A bit on the drier side though. And the paneer tacos were by far the best thing we ordered that night but was dripping in oil! Would've felt a little better about it if it wasn't dripping in so much oil. The entree - schezwan vegetable coins was okay at best. One of the servers forgot to bring the rice with it. Towards the end, the servers rushed us out. Overall, would not recommend this place.",

It wasn't just bad service - it was comically bad service. The food was only alright, and it doesn't make up for the service.  The woman that waited on us was nice enough, but she seemed to have trouble following what was going on. I couldn't tell if it was a language barrier or an intellectual issue, but she didn't seem to understand a lot of what we asked. We ordered spring rolls, and after checking with the kitchen, she told us they were out. So I asked about another appetizer, and she just looked at me and then made this weird gesture with her head and made a sound. My husband and I took that to mean they did have them, and she wrote the item on her pad of paper. When our food arrived, I asked the different person who brought the food where the appetizer was, and she said that they didn't have any of those and she was sorry. It seemed like they were out of a lot of stuff, but we couldn't get anyone to clearly communicate what.   The food was not great either. My husband ordered a spicy dish, and the server with the communication issue kept telling him it was spicy. He told her that he wanted it medium-to-hot, and she replied, \"Mild? It's very spicy.\" He told her that he likes spice, but he didn't want something that was so spicy there was no flavor. Again, he said \"medium hot\" and she just did that thing where she bobbed her head. When the food came, his had absolutely NO spice at all. My dish, which was supposed to be mild, was much spicier than his. Luckily there are a bunch of hot sauces at the table, and he doctored it up, but what a mess. The server decided from the beginning he should not have spicy food and ran with it. She also had a confusing habit of running her pen down the menu and then pointing to the wrong item. We were somewhat impressed we got what we ordered.  Finally, we waited and waited for the check. I made eye contact numerous times, and another server asked me if I was waiting on something. I told her that we needed a box and the check. Nothing happened. Eventually the original server came over and I asked for the check, to which she replied, \"Is everything ok?\" I asked again for the check, and she stared at me for a second before wandering off. Another person brought us the check and box.   The whole experience was absolutely bizarre. I do not understand how they run a business with this staff.",

All dishes tasted good but American chopsoey is big no. It doesn't taste like chopsoey at all. Sauce is too sweet and tasted like a desert .  All the qualities are very small and tiny. For 3 people we ordered 4 entrees it was on point no leftovers. Request to management Please look into the portions you are serving small.",

The spice level was the right amount of heat.    The service was very poor.  Some of our items were forgotten.  We arrived about 930pm and they close at 10.  We got our food around 950pm and while we were mid meal we were asked to close the check.  This is understandable, but everyone seemed to be packed and ready to go while we were dining.  We felt rushed.  Wasn't the level of professional service one would expect.  Most of the points they lose in my review is based on their substandard service.",

    "text": "So freaking excited that we finally have an indian-chineese fusion place around here!  My wife and I love indo chineese... it's one of the fusions we look forward to on all our trips to india.  With these two countries neighboring each other it's not surprising the flavors are compatible and can cross pollinate so well.  The only real question is why hasn't it picked up more in the US.    That said, Inchin Bamboo Garden is a breath of fresh air in the relatively mediocre indian food options we have in the Phoenix area. Hallelujah!     That said, they're not quite into our regular rotation for a few key reasons.  1) The service needs some work.  Too often we found ourselves waiting for soda/water refills, etc.  This might be because the location was relatively new when we went there, so I'm willing to not slam them on this as much as I would a more established place.  Pick it up guys.  2) Some of the dishes seemed to err just a bit on salt/msg side common in some cheaper chineese restaurants. Again, they were new and were probably still dialing things in.    All that said, those draw backs weren't really bad enough to prevent us from going there again...   Because honestly the food is that much fun!  And vegetarians... EAT HERE!! LOTS OF NUMMY NUMMY GOODNESS for you :)   And protip:  Chili Paneer.   YUM YUM!! EAT IT!",

    "text": "Concur with the theme of the previous posts.    Pros: Indo-Chinese food that is more than passable.  Not as good as Mumbai (what is?) or NYC/SF, but still pretty darn good.  We like their fried rice and noodles more than their actual meat dishes.  I think their noodles/fried rice are 4-5 bit their actual meat dishes are 3-4.    Cons: service.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Did I mention that the service is horrible?  And this means all types of service, takeout and eating in.  In fact, we will not dine there anymore because the service is so bad.  So we stick with takeout.  But they have missed their promised time by more than an hour once before.  And that my friends, takes True effort.  If you get your food within 15 min of it being promised, consider yourself lucky.  These guys want to be so authentic, they are actually on IST (Indian Standard Time for the non-desis reading this).  That being said, it's something we put up with because we do like the food.  We order from here at least twice a month.  It would be more, and we'd also dine in, if there was any semblance of decent, timely service.    I hope the management can fix the service issue, because if they can't, they are going to frustrate otherwise loyal patrons.",

Gradually the service went from OK to bad. On our as last two visits even the food was bad.   We ordered cauliflower manchurian, veg coin manchurian, and burnt garlic friedrice. Both the manchurians were only warm, as opposed to being hot. I don't think they were made fresh. The Veg coins were not cooked properly. The burnt garlic fried rice was good.   We also ordered veg noodles, and they gave us a bowl of noodles without any vegetables at all.   Since this is the only Indo-Chinese restaurant in the valley, clearly the owners got complacent, and there is not enough supervision. I will not be going there any more.",

The veg coin in schezwan sauce was also lovely. Most dishes are priced $10 on an average and we got a bill of around $300 between the 13 of us which is slightly on the pricier side i guess. All in all, a great place if you are looking for some Indianized Chinese food (yes, its a thing).",

    "text": "I wish we had read the other yelp reviews before we went here, because it perfectly described our experience: over-priced, highly mediocre food and horrific service!  PROS: the interior is quite lovely. Very nice design and beautiful b&w photography in the hallway to the bathrooms.   CONS: everything else that goes into a restaurant. We went in at 6:30pm to have some drinks/apps on happy hour and order some entrees to go. The signs say that they open for dinner at 5:30pm and that happy hour is 5:30-7:30pm. No restrictions listed. When we came in, the restaurant was completely empty, we were the only people there. When we asked if we could order some food & drinks and order some entrees to go, we were told happy hour is only for dine in. I've never heard this before as I've done this at plenty of restaurants so only assumed that she didn't understand that we were planning to have the drinks and apps in the restaurant, just not the entrees we were ordering. It seemed pretty self-evident that we can't take cocktails to go. The server was clearly pissed at our stupid question so stormed off saying she would ask her manager, returned immediately saying her manager said no and went about setting up the bar and doing something on the pos system.  Just seems like hospitality 101 to me that if we are the only customers in your restaurant and planning to order lots of food, you would give us the few dollars discount on some cocktails, but fine. My mom ordered a cocktail and I ordered a wine. Angry server walked off again saying she was getting her manager. Turns out the manager, who was actually polite to us, is the only one there who knows how to make the cocktails on their menu. It took her about 10-15 to finally get our drinks (again, we are the only people in the restaurant) because she had to keep running to the back to stock the wine fridge, to get ice, to get clean glassware, etc.  So basically, this place was open for one hour (according to posted operations hours) and no one has prepped the bar or set anything up, and they are basically pushing out the only customers in the place! I guess it was somewhat comforting to see that the nasty server seemed to hate all customers, not just us. Some of her high moments: ignored everyone who walked in, people who went up to her to ask for a table were told \"hold on\" with an epic eye roll, sneered at us when we said \"thank you\" as we left.   Final takeaway: the food here is not good enough to justify going back after dealing with such awful attitude, complete affront to the concept of \"service industry\".",

    "text": "UPDATE: From the management:  but I would like to point out that our fried rice does not have peas or carrots either  Classic. My photos clearly indicate your restaurant is indeed using frozen peas and carrots.   Indian? The only thing Indian about the place is the Basmati rice and the clientiele. On a recent Saturday night, the place was packed with Indian folks (and Indian babies yelling), but this is not an Indian restaurant obviously. If you don't have any NAAN, then excuse me, you are nothing. If your telling me that the six sauces on the table will make my food taste Indian, then your wrong again. The entire menu is Chinese and they can't do that right either. Take a look at my disgusting, tiny frozen shrimp and that is one indication. The singapore noodles were not bad, but the shrimp and grease from whatever else went into the dish made it pretty poorish. The \"fried\" rice doesn't have soy sauce, so that's not authentic and they use frozen peas and carrots in the rice as well. I did not notice many Indian apps, except for fried cheese, but if you order the $8 veggie spring rolls and the place knows you are going to split them, please give us four, not three rolls. Most dipping sauces will tear your tongue off with hotness as well.   How about tandori chicken Chow mein or Naan Moo Shu? This turns out to be part of a big chain and corporate folks need to make changes and my email has been sent about that poor excuse for shrimp. About $11 per plate lost tonight.",

Very expensive for what you got ($14 and up/plate).  We each got a different dish - my husband got General Tso's chicken, my son got Szechuan beef and I got chicken with black bean sauce (which I ordered because it said it came with vegetables).  All dishes came with a small bowl of white rice.  Each order was quite large - all three dishes were huge portions of meat swimming in gelatinous sauces - with literally nary a vegetable in sight.  Nuttin', nada, rien, NONE.  So you got meat, sauce and rice, period.  And it was all pretty tasteless...if the waitress had not brought over a rack of Inchin's own house sauces, it would have been almost inedible.  Yuck.  Expensive, not as advertised, unappetizing, tasteless.  And to top it all off, the service was very slow and inattentive.  We won't be back.",

    "text": "Having had Chinese food in India while growing up, we went with a lot of anticipation. Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.  The Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.  We wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.  The service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.  Our receipt invited us to share our experience at a \"Talk2us\" link, which only produced a \"survey error.\"  Having had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.",

So are they not serving fresh food? Then we got our food extremely late. The food came out at different timings. The \"Diced Chicken\" and the \"Thai Curry\" took over an hour to come even after our first entree had come. They sent the chicken to the table next to us, and eventually the table next to us left before eating due to rude/inadequate service!! 5 different waiters served us throughout the night. Really disorganized. When we would ask a server something they would completely forget about it. The waiters for our table changed 5 times. The food was also below average. We spent almost 2 hours there and it was a huge waste of our time. Will not be coming back.",

In the overall review, the two negative stars above are for the customer service and portion size, specifically, when you try to cater an event.

If it says 10, it should suffice 10 at least, if not more.   He recommended that we order 2 appetizer 2 entree 1 rice 1 noodle for $320. Delivery charge is $75. We asked why we could not order exactly as per the catering menu, only to be told that \"he did not work that way\" and also asked to place the order right then and now, since he had a lot of orders.

I tried a few vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, and all were appetizing. My group particularly liked the Crispy Lamb Peking! The ambiance was very appealing, modern Asian decor, great for a date when you're tired of the same old food/restaurant choices.  The \"burnt garlic chili fried rice\" sounded like it would be amazing, but there wasn't really much substance to it - just lightly flavored rice with a hint of chili spice.  Also some of the entrees, though they were different sauce choices, tasted almost identical if not for the different meats selected.  However, the tables come equipped with a variety of sauces, so you can customize your meal to your taste.    Definitely give this place a try, you'll be happy you did!",

I ordered hot n sour soup, lat mai kai, chicken 65, egg Hakka chowmein, chicken Hakka noodle, sweet n sour chicken, chilli garlic chicken.  Pretty much huh!! When I came home I saw that the appetizers are really small in quantity and doesn't taste that good.i took these items before and I loved those.though I like the chowmein and sweet n sour chicken.n think It ll b better if I dine in here next time.:(",

Someone with food allergies should avoid this restaurant as they provide misleading information. Good ambience but Too much grease in the food.  Upon reading the review, The management was kind enough to enquire about what happened and accepted their mistake. They sent a gift card to be redeemed at next visit. Would give them another chance for sure.",

The food was great. $8.10 for soup, veggie egg roll and mixed veggies and brown rice.   Ladies working were super nice and I enjoyed their company while sitting at the bar.   I'll be back. Super spicy just the way I like it!!!",
