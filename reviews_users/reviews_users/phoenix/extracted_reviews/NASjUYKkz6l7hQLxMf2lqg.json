    "text": "I don't write many reviews anymore, but Chanpen Thai was so inspiring I just had to contribute!  South Phoenicians and Tempe residents rejoice, because this is seriously the best Thai food I've had in quite some time, possibly ever!  Anyone who knows anything about food understands that its the little hole-in-the-wall shops that are the best and this place is no different.  I'm honestly a little worried about when the word gets out because its such a small location, they will easily be packed.    We ordered some of our favorite standards: fresh veggie rolls with tofu, veggie pad thai and veggie panang curry.  Everything was seriously amazing.  Even the heat was just right...we ordered everything at a 3 on a 0-5 scale and it was perfect.  The curry flavor and creaminess plus the veggie selection and giant tofu chunks was the best panang I've ever had.  The pad thai was exceptional, again with the giant tofu chunks.  Serving sizes were great.  I was hoping to try dessert, but the food was so phenomenal I couldn't stop eating it!    They have a pretty extensive menu, and it sounds like they are pretty much willing to make anything the way you want it.  They asked us if we wanted to add tofu to the fresh rolls even though it wasn't on the menu, and made sure egg was ok in the pad thai.  Their lunch specials also look good for $6.    We were also told that on Friday and Saturdays they will be offering DELIVERY!  We are in trouble.",

Well, anyway, upon entering the restaurant, I was a little worried. This place is small... aaand not so squeaky clean.... aaand kind of on the old side, BUT do not be deterred. The food was legit. More legit than anywhere else I have had in Phoenix. The lunch special was a steal at 6.50$ and coming with soup, entree, spring roll, fried crispy wonton things, and rice (if you don't have noodles). The soup was delicious, a slightly spicy lemongrass flavored soup with fresh veg inside. For my entree, I had the drunken noodles and they were the most flavorful drunken noodles I have had in town. I often complain that my noodles are too dry, not so here. The noodles had tons of fresh veggies (broccoli, onion, carrots, basil, bell peppers, etc) that were cooked perfectly. I would go back for that dish, but I also would like to try their curry... it looks great. This place has serious five star potential. Will be making a return appearance soon!  PS Like others have mentioned, seating is limited, so we had to wait a bit for a table, but the wait was totally worth it.",

    "text": "VERY happy with this place.  My fiance and I consider ourselves kind of Thai food snobs.  And this is REAL AUTHENTIC Thai.  (I've been to the places that Phoenix magazine rated top Thai in Phoenix and went only to find a watered down mess).  There is a very sweet Thai woman in the back whipping up all of your food.  I didn't think we were going to find a Thai place we loved as much as Line Thai (in Sun City) when we moved to Scottsdale.  But we did!  While Line Thai is truly the number one, this comes in a VERY close second.  Everything we've had so far has been amazing.  And we go in about once a week now and order something different. Everything is fresh and steaming hot when it gets to you.  Be prepared: Now, when you say HOLE in the wall - this is it!  about 8 tables, if that, and it's no bigger than your living room.  The neighborhood is sparce, and a little less desirable, but I guess that's where you find all the good hole in the wall places!   The dining area isn't the cleanest either but that doesn't speak for the food or the kitchen.  What really won me over is a homeless man walked in from 110 degree heat, hot and confused and they gave him a bottle of cold water and some food and he left.  A True family business, willing to help.",

You can customize your level of spicy between 0-5 and we both had level 3 and that was perfect if not a little too hot so level 5 must be banana sandwich. Do not judge this place by the outside as it is small but there were a few people who stopped in while we were here. While we were here we got complimentary coconut ice cream.",

I typically get cashew chicken.  They offer 5 levels of spiciness for their dishes, and I absolutely LOVE spicy food, so I go for a 5 every time.  Let me tell you, it does not disappoint when it comes to flavor or spice.    My wife, on the other hand, typically gets royal curry chicken, with a spiciness level of 1 (she can't even handle the spice of black pepper).  The curry is wonderful by her account (she loves curry) and also by mine (I have never been fond of curry until trying Chanpen).  It's often the holes in the wall that house the greatest treasures when it comes to cuisine, and this is no exception.  If you like Thai food or even if you don't, you owe it to yourself to try Chanpen.  It's the best Phoenix has to offer.",

Boy am I sure glad I did. It's a small hole in the wall spot, maybe seating for 30 max. The lunch specials all hover around the $6.50 range and come with this awesome soup and an egg roll (that comes with your food, so don't be sily like me and order extra egg rolls..you won't be able to finish it all haha). The soup came out first. it was a semi spicy vegetable soup with some red curry and lemongrass. Just a killer way to start my meal. I went with the Pad Thai with chicken and Shrimp. Easily some of the best pad thai I've ever had. It had a very citrus-like quality to the sauce, which I liked. i ordered mine 2 on a scale of 1-5 for spiciness. I could have handled the 3 and I don't really like super spicy food. Another diner with me ordered the spicy noodles (drunken) with chicken. This is my fave dish from Thai Hit, and the one here at Chanpen is just as good, if not better. All in all, a great meal and a killer lunch spot in the area.",

    "text": "First time Yelp entry. Use Yelp extensively when traveling, but, this one deserves notice. Ordered take out Stir Frey Mixed Veggies w the Combo Meat Option (shrimp, chix, beef), at a level 2 spice level. Fabulous. Fresh veggies are hard to find. Wish I was staying a few more days so I could try other menu items. Really. This is the first time I've wanted to make a post,and this place deserves it so please patronize so they are still there on my next trip ! Its a tiny shop on a dark street (well lighted lot at night, and safe). Suggest take out as dining in only has a few small tables, but kitchen knows what they are doing. I seek out Thai throughout the country, and this place ranks in the top 10%. Enjoy and keep them in business please !!",

I had the panang curry with tofu which was good. My husband had the drunken noodles with beef which was also quite flavorful. This restaurant has moderately increased prices since opening but offers green tea ice cream with chocolate drizzle as a complementary dessert surprise. It was quite refreshing. The bench could use an upgrade as my guest and I played a game of tug-of-back. I lost. The staff really seems to enjoy themselves as loud bantering in another language dominated conversation throughout our meal.",

They cut a hole in the delivery container so the steam from the egg rolls could get out and avoid making the egg rolls soggy. I ordered the lunch portion of Pad Thai (medium/hot spice level) and it has some serious heat but not so that it's not enjoyable. The noodles are perfect, chicken is juicy and has a wonderful flavor! Delivery boy was very nice. I will be ordering from here again! :)",

The atmosphere needs a little work, so know you are going for the service and food if you visit.  They have great weekday specials, and brought me a free fried banana as a gift for visiting. I drank five glasses of water (I requested my food very spicy), and each time, the glass was promptly refilled. I will be back!",

    "text": "I just moved from Gilbert Az. to South Phoenix and unfortunately, there are not too many great restaurants here. Thai and Indian are my favorite, so I was delighted to notice this tiny hole-in-the-wall Thai place open up on Broadway just west of 28th St. You really need to pay attention not to pass this place up. They decor inside is very quaint. They can probably only fit about 15-20 people packed tight, but I love places like this and  I've been sad not to see more cars in front and I finally got to go last night and brought a friend and we both LOVED it! We were they only ones there (at 5:30p) but about 6 other patrons rolled in over the next 30 minutes or so. We pigged out too (hey, I wanted to support the business!). We had green curry with pork, drunken noodles, Tom Kha Gai (coconut/lemon-grass soup) and for desert, we ordered a sticky rice with mango (choices are mango or ice creme...no custard unfortunately), plus they brought us a free fried banana (looked like egg rolls) with chocolate sauce (I had to bring about half of all this home). Everything was incredibly good. I would give the top-most rating to the soup. The portion of mango on the sticky rice was massive. I'd guess 1/4 pound. I suspect that won't last long once they get established, but who knows. I'm sure they are trying extra hard to please and we were! The only complaint I have is their Thai coffee was too sweet. Still pretty good, but if I have that problem again, I will let them know. I will definitely go back and hope others will too to ensure they stay survive. A nice little oasis in this Thai-barren desert. One last note, Thai Basil is one of my favorites and as far as food quality and flavor goes, I would say these two are about the same.",

The service was great especially considering my wife and I first visit was on a Saturday. I ordered the thai egg rolls which were amazing I could have eating a dozen of them the outside layered crunch paired with a slightly soft interior and fresh vegetables was awesome. The shrimp spring rolls were really good as well and super fresh but I am a sucker for egg rolls done right so next time I will order more then I did as each order comes with 2 pieces. The pad thai was my entree which for me honestly ordering at a heat level of 3 was on the really sweet side however the hostess did offer to make it for me adding additional oyster sauce in order to settle the sweetness down. I declined and just asked for some on the side and she gladly provided me some just because of my own taste buds looking for that heat element with a little sweet. My wife had the combination rice which she loves heat so ordering the level 5, though I warned her she loved it. There thai tea was killer we ended up ordering 2 and also another to go because there truly addicting. Our meal was completed with a green tea ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce complementary plus a smile. Perfect way to end our lunch date and on to shopping not feeling heavy at all. I must say that we already plan to come back to this cute little spot again.",

There are only 4 or 5 tables inside and last time it was packed with a wait. Both the red and yellow curry shrimp are fabulous, nice size shrimp that are sweet and of high quality, and medium heat is the perfect amount of burn. Prices are so reasonable for the quantity of food you get. Highly recommend trying this place out.",

I think you can tell which is better. The service here is awesome-- everyone is so friendly and helpful. The food here is by far the best Thai food I've ever had. To be clear, I do not like Thai food at all but I crave the food here all the time. The last time we came here I got my grandpa the stir fried snow pea on rice (I have no idea what it's called) and it was so good and fresh. My grandma who is picky had the pad see ew and it was indescribably delicious. I do not like pad see ew and I could eat this pad see ew every day. I had the pa nang curry with level 4 spice and it was incredible. I wish I could be more descriptive but just believe me that it is incredible, as is the yellow curry. The portions are also huge. Our meal for 4 could've fed 7-8 easily.   The price for the food is great and our server gave us complimentary green tea ice cream. This place could not be better (okay unless there were less flies and it weren't so small and ghetto)",

I drove past the place 2 times because it turns out it's a beat up shack in a sort of run down area, so it blended in. I try to not judge a book by its cover, plus again there must have been a reason they were highly rated.  When I walked in it had 6 seats and it seemed very dirty inside, almost uncomfortably dirty. The service was polite but seemed pretty chaotic, I didn't know if I ordered at the counter, or to be seated or what to do.   When I took a seat a guy came and made a recommendation for the lunch special which actually saved me money so that was a plus.   Vegetarian Pad Thai noodles with veggies, and Tofu, an egg roll, and fried won tons.  I got the food in a timely manner which also was a plus because I was on a lunch break.  When I got my food the portion seemed a bit small. The Egg Roll was literally no joke the size of my pinky finger and it came with 3 Won Ton chips. The Pad Thai had WAY too much sauce, and the sauce was a too over bearing and too sweet. It had 2 pieces of Brocoli, 3 pieces of Tofu, and some Bean Sprouts. The pad Thai did not seem cooked through either it was too rubbery.   Maybe it's the taste of their Meat that has landed them a \"Best of Phoenix\" award but I couldn't back it. I was uncomfortable the entire time with how dirty it was and ultimately lost my appetite and didn't finish my food. Needless to say I won't be returning unfortunately.",

I ordered it a few times a month when I loved in CA. Decided to give this place a try hoping to find a thai restaurant here in phoenix. Ordered the soup for take home/pick up.  The soup was very disappointing to say the least. It didn't have lemon grass or chicken as it does elsewhere. It had a few mushrooms and there was a layer of oil on top which had separated from the base. It tasted awful and I threw it out. I hate to waste food and thus will eat things that aren't great as to not waste but I just couldn't stomach it. As for now I wait for my trips back to CA to order Thai food. Hope to find a good Thai place out here though. Here's hoping, fingers crossed lol. Hope I don't have to waste more food and money in the process.",

Well, well I know we found out go to spot for our Thai fix. We drove 30 minutes to get here so right there tells you that these foodies were on a definite mission, lol! Okay so as we walk into this TINY restaurant which has 2 booths that seat four & 4 tables we are immediately greeted by the wonderful smells of herbs & spices & everthing else that goes with the fresh cooking of Thai food in a tiny place!! Yes it was that good, now as far as the customer service which you could tell this was strictly family owned & run was beyond top notch, gosh I love hidden gems like this!! We placed our order of chicken satay, crispy crab wontons, fried pot stickers, chicken teriyaki & shrimp pad-see yew, I know we went a tad overboard but we chose all our faves!! As we were waiting they gave us a complimentary bottled water & some homemade coconut icecream for the three of us. As soon as we tasted the icecream we knew we were definitely in for a treat & we found our spot, thankfully!! As for the food which my hubby was literally being torchered by the 1/2 hour drive, smelling the food & unable to sample but when we got home & finally dug in OMG, OMG is all that can be said!! The chicken satay which is my hubby's choice always was so moist & perfectly cooked & he was in love with the sauce! The pot stickers which is also all hubby took him to heaven & back, those were completely inhaled by him!! The chicken teriyaki was perfectly cooked, not too sweet & not too salty & served with plenty of sauce unlike a lot of places. Now my crab wontons were some of the best I've had, you could tell that the wonton was freshly made because they were thin & crispy with just the right amount of sweetness!! The pad-see yew was beyond amazing, I had them make it on a level 3 & it was perfect with a nice kick of spice. It was made perfectly with just the right amount of egg, bean sprouts & brocoli & served with 6 large shrimp!! We will definitely without a doubt be back & hopefully sooner than later, maybe even this weekend, lol!!",

The setup is small, lots of lunch take out.   Service is always friendly here, they bring you a small cup of soup complimentary:   I stick to the yellow curry or pad tai with fresh rolls as an app. Both are top notch.   I will be here again for my neighborhood lunch spot from work.",

Today, 8/17 I went for lunch pick up and the regular young man was not there today that normally greets with a smile and a bottle of water was not there. The lady there today, no smile no water, I asked her how she is doing no response. The issue that caused me to write this and give  2 stars instead of 4 was how instead of giving me my change in my extended hand she put it down on the table. I let it slide and did not inform the lady that act is seen as disrespectful and some cases racist. I'll be back to Chanpen but if this continues you will be put on blast for real. This is your warning to remind you that disrespectful hosts and cashiers will not be tolerated... besides that lunch is great.  Update:8/31- the person in question apologized on yelp app and was thanked for taking time to do so. Explained the miscommunication. Not calling the person racist, but her action on that day were questionable.",

However, halfway through my pad Thai, I found a strand of short hair on my plate. I knew it was definitely not mine or my friend's. I was enjoying the pad Thai and was SO disappointed to find hair in my food... that's literally one of my pet peeves/worst nightmares. I know everyone makes mistakes, but it doesn't make the situation any less disappointing. I do however still think that the food in general was good, and the service was superb. I was in a rush when I went, but the server was very attentive to our needs.  This is kind of a loner small house/building along Broadway. There is a small parking lot right outside of it. It's small on the inside, and the food was delicious. But because of the hair, I probably won't come back here for a while.",

Regardless, the food is worth waiting for a seat or takin food home.  The staff is very nice, and they do feel bad when they can't seat everyone, but that's beyond their control. And quite frankly, I wouldn't want them to have a huge location only because I think it could change the quality of their food by doing so.",

My hubby is a particular eater, he got the pineapple fried rice and thoroughly enjoyed his dish. My hubby has a seafood allergy, they were able to accommodate with no issues.

Got the spicy chx fried rice, 3 out of 5 spice, added broccoli. Only 9 bucks, worth every penny. It's definitely so busy for a reason. I plan on being back very soon. Didnt have a great Thai place near my last residence, just moved to the area. For those who like kick but not on fire, 3 of 5 was a perfect medium, anything more is prolly gonna be too hot for you. Anyone who loves hotter should be satisfied with 4 or 5.",

When we drove up at night my husband said, \"I don't think this is it, I don't think you can eat here...\". We decided to give it a try anyways and we were not disappointed! It is a very small restaurant, but the workers were so nice and welcoming.   We tried the Panang curry and the chicken Pad Thai and both were heavenly. We tried their spring rolls and those were very good too, and reasonably priced. We got 3 spicy and that was about perfect, some good heat, but I wasn't dying. The curry was so smooth and had a good amount of meat and perfectly cooked vegetables. They didn't scrimp on rice either, which I hate. The Pad Thai was just amazing, spicy and peanuty, my mouth is watering as I write this. We ended with a small bowl of their green tea ice cream, which I normally don't love, but it was great!   Food = Amazing, Service = Friendly, Price = Very Reasonable. We were only in Phoenix for 3 days and I ate here twice, it's that good. I cannot wait to come back in the future!!",

I have to say that I am jealous that we in Cleveland don't have such a great Thai place. They would make a killer here as they apparently do in Phoenix. The restaurant is small yet easily to find on the main road of East Broadway Road. We walked into the tiny place only to be greeted with a warm and friendly service.   Based on other Yelper's reviews I new that I had to try their Drunken Noodles. My hubby got the Pad Thai. We took our meals with us and began eating them in the airport as we waited before boarding our flight. I have to say that both dishes were huge and delicious and normally I can't finish a whole meal in one sitting. However, it was different this time around. I literally could not stop eating my Drunken Noodles. Pure gluttony on my part. They were that good.   I still dream of this place and the next chance that I will be able to eat their food. Thank-You Chanpen Thai! You are that Good!",

Looks a little run down from the outside but do not let that fool you! The inside is small, warm and inviting. The customer service is outstanding! I ordered my meal to go and received a free water bottle. The gentlemen even helped me out since my hands were full. The food is delicious! I ordered the drunken noodles #2 on the spice scale and it is perfect. The lunch portion was easy on the wallet and just enough to satisfy. Thank you Chanpen for a wonderful experience I will definitely return!",

    "text": "In my opinion, this is the best Thai food in the Phoenix metro area, bar none, and maybe the best in Arizona. I've been coming to Chanpen since it opened back up several years ago and just realized (while writing a negative review of a different Thai place) that I'd never gotten around to reviewing it. I have brought, over the years, 20 or more people here, and each one of them has loved the food. Several of my New York friends said it was the best Thai food they've ever had (and they have access to a ton of excellent Thai restaurants). I almost always start off with a bowl of coconut soup to share with the table -- I highly recommend it! The curries are always on point, as are their noodle dishes. If you're not sold on pad thai, try it here -- it's flavorful and vibrant like so many other pad thais aren't. The specials they post are always delicious -- I've yet to order a bad dish from this place. Friends have gotten various salads, seafood dishes, soups, and dumplings, and always loved them.  Also, here, Thai spicy means Thai spicy. If you order a 5 on the spice scale, be prepared to sweat. The spiciness still leaves plenty of room to taste and savor the coconut flavor that makes Thai food so rewarding and decadent, and if spices are not your thing, the food still tastes good if ordered at a 0 or 1.  The service here is excellent. The waitstaff is super polite, and will give you bottled water if you're waiting for takeout, or complimentary green tea ice cream if you choose to dine in. They're great at answering questions, refilling water glasses, and splitting checks, and they never leave you feeling ignored. I also love that, despite the small number of tables inside the restaurant, they never make people dining in feel rushed. In fact, they've waited around well past closing time on several occasions so that my friends and I could enjoy our meals. Even knowing we were finishing up at 8:30 or so, they still brought us the complimentary ice cream, still helped us scoop leftovers into to-go boxes, and still gave us extra rice to take with us.  So, now let's address the elephant in the room -- location and atmosphere. This restaurant is not in a great part of town. In fact, it's one of the few things in an otherwise pretty barren part of Phoenix that tends to house towing lots and the like. You will easily drive past it if you're not looking carefully, and when you pull in (especially if it's at night), you'll go \"are you sure this is the place?\" You may even feel unsafe because of the poor lighting and somewhat dingy appearance. I urge you to put those feelings aside and venture in, because the food and service are easily worth it. Or order takeout.",

But when I did a \"best of Thai food in 85040\" search on yep it come up with over 400 great reviews. I don't usually take time to write reviews, but for Chanpen Thai Cuisine I will!!!  It is a small place, don't plan on eating there if you arrive after 11:15 AM. My favorite dish is the Pad Thai. Food is always fresh and large portions. They even have creative daily specials. Staff is friendly and I have always had great service. When you order take out, they give you a bottle of ice cold water no charge. A hidden gem that you must not over look.",

The place is very small and looks a bit dirty, but don't let that fool you. The food is excellent!   We ordered the chicken satay appetizer, the red curry with pork, the chicken and shrimp pad Thai, and the stir fried beef with garlic sauce. Everything was delicious. The food looks so colorful and bright. The pad Thai and curry were my favorites in particular. The noodles were moist and not rubbery at all with lots of flavor. The curry was simple but flavorful.   They give out complimentary dessert at the end. I heard it's normally ice cream, but this time it was the fried banana. My mom was especially happy about this since she was asking us if we could order some at the end. Maybe they heard us. Or maybe they just guessed. Either way, great move.   The service was quick. The waitress was courteous and prompt, and the food came out pretty quickly.   I will definitely try to find this place again when we're coming through the city. This restaurant is a must-go!",

If you're in your car reading this review and looking for a place to eat... Uhm... Go here.  I will be honest, I've not ventured into other options on their menu.  I've been stuck on the first thing that I tried here.  The garlic chicken is simply amazing.  A very spicy and flavorful dish that lights your taste buds up and sets your mouth aflame.    Don't be afraid to stop in here because it is very small.  There is an option to sit in the tiny dining room.  There may be 6 3-top tables in the dining room.    Whatever you do. Please be patient.",

I had the pineapple fried rice and it was massive and an excellent choice. The pineapple was not canned. I also got the mas-sa mun curry with chicken. I'd never had it but it was amazing and they give you a good portion of white rice with it. My friends had the Thai iced tea and they thought it was amazing too. They speak English in the kitchen though they have Thai blood. Despite that, it's still possibly the best Thai I've had.   The only thing to be aware of is this place is pretty small.

Last time I was there, they left their health department paperwork sitting plainly on the counter where you pay and pickup to go food. I could see clearly that they were cited for not washing hands or having hand washing areas in food prep spaces. The disregard for 1. Leaving those citations sitting out for anyone to see (this information does not need to be displayed by law, only the Letter rating does) and 2. Not washing hands which is a simple thing to do, both shock me and gross me out. It will be a little bit of time before I decide to visit here again.",

The curry came with a bowl of rice and the Pad Thai had bean sprouts, a lime wedge, and crushed peanuts on the side. All dishes were excellent.  Each plate's price ranges depending on the meat choice ordered. Chicken and vegetarian, for instance, is the cheapest. Seafood makes your order slightly pricier.  My friends ordered Thai iced tea and the tea to milk ratio was great. The cup was filled with tea and they added a splash of milk.   When you're done with your meal, they then bring out a small single scoop of what I believe was coconut-pineapple ice cream. That was a sweet surprise.  The downside from this place was how ghetto the building was. It is so inconspicuous and had a lot of flies inside. I didn't want to use the bottled hot sauce because we saw a fly dive in.",

First time I attempted to get here, I drove through lots of cones due to construction as though I was in a obstacle course. When I was almost there, the street was blocked off! We ended up taking residential side street. Needless to say, I drove thru crack or pot houses before I got here. All excited to check out what the fuss is all about .... The restaurant was full. With less than 10 tables at the restaurant, I finally gave up and ate somewhere else.   Second attempt: we were determined to get here by 11:30am to get a table. YES! There was one. I ordered a Drunken noodle dish that was highly recommended by my coworker and man.....IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! Every bite is seasoned and juicy. Not to mention it was hot as hell to my liking. When I look inside the kitchen, yes....the cooks are also Thai (can't get more authentic than that).   Regardless how crowded and how unpleasant the surrounding is, I will come back here again and again.   BEST THAI RESTAURANT EVER!!!!!",

And this is the only Thai place I went to in Arizona.  Without further to do....  I was very disappointed with the food. The green curry I had was very watery. We ordered 3 beef dishes and all tasted very similar, but had different vegetables that accompanied the beef. Pineapple fried rice could have used a little more flavor.   What was good:  Pad see ew was good, but nothing that stood out from other places. Tom yum soup was very flavorful and had good chunks of chicken and mushrooms. Thai ice tea was on point as well. They gave us big portions, which is always a plus.   This was a take out order so we can't comment on the service, but the people there were very nice when we checked out.",

When I went to pick up the only parking available was directly in front of the main door, ok cool. Went inside, closed the door behind me..no special aromas hit me. Secondly it's so tiny and mind you I am not a big person, but geeze this place is small.  People sitting at tables automatically stare at you while you stand in line at the counter to pay. I also got the Thai iced tea, it was ok, it had great big chunks of sticks at the very bottom that came up thru my straw, not cool. Haven't these people heard of a strainer..? Anyway on to the food.   The pad thai combo was nothing special, I asked for medium spice it came out mild.  The pineapple fried rice was ok, again asked for medium and got mild. eh. whatever. It did satisfy the thai craving I had, but was nothing wonderful..and for all this I paid 22 bucks, and got exactly 3 shrimp I believe, can't recall just remember feeling really underwhelmed by the whole experience. Yes I would eat here again, but no I would not give them 5 stars for quality and price.",

It's a tiny place inside, literally six tables. You may have to wait a couple minutes to be seated, but it's worth it. Why? Read on...  Atmosphere: tiny and not the cleanest, a True \"hole in the wall\", the kind of place for me. Why? The food:  it's excellent, high-quality, fresh, clearly made with care and from what seems like \"old world\" recipes. Spices are well-balanced and the tastes are clean. Prices are outstanding, well under $10 for a full lunch and you will get plenty of food. The service is always friendly, courteous and with a smile.  It's really hard to beat this little \"joint\". They seem to have the right combination. It's certainly not a Flemings or Nortons type of atmosphere. But, if you appreciate good food with excellent quality, good portions, great service and a genuine \"non-chain\", privately owned, local restaurant, don't miss this one.",

Be careful with the spice level. They give you a 1-5 option. I got a 3 the first time I ate here and it was much spicier than I anticipated (but didn't stop me from eating everyyyyything).   Price - amazing Customer service - amazing (such friendly staff!) Seating - very limited Parking - very limited  And my favorite - COMPLIMENTARY DESSERT that tastes even better than the price :)  I will be visiting again next time I am in the area. Highly recommend!",

We were the only ones in the place around 6pm on a Monday night so a relatively early dinner but by the time we left, the place was almost full and more than five people had come in to pick up their orders to go. We ordered the chicken potstickers, spicy sweet basil with chicken, and panang curry with chicken.  I like a good amount of spice so we ordered at a level 3 for both entrees and it was perfect! The servers were attentive to water refills, asking how the food was, if we needed anything else, etc. Upon receiving the check, we also received complimentary ice cream which was just as delicious as the main meal! The ONLY  thing that could make this fabulous find even better is a delivery service!",

I raced to this location at around 7:15 to make it before the closing time at 8pm. They quickly got our orders and brought it. It had a ton of flavor and everyone in the kitchen spoke Thai. The international vibe in this hole in the wall is definitely what drew my attention. I wanted mango sticky rice but the girl who took the order told us she only had sour mangos and she wouldn't offer us that because it would be rude. And I was very happy to hear her honesty and thanked her for that. Mangoes need to perfectly ripe and I am glad I didn't get screwed over. She did give us complimentary coconut icecream  with pineapple chunks and it was the icing on top!   I loved the spicy basil chicken and drunken noodles. Great flavors and great vibes.   Yelp definitely directs you correctly into the best places in town and it's always great to confirm their reviews by experiencing them firsthand.",

We ordered take-out and was pleasantly surprised by a free bottle of water when picking up the good. Our dinner consisted of the Beef Salad, Rad Nar, and Pad Thai.   The beef salad had good flavor with a hefty serving of veggies such as lettuce and cucumbers but I thought the beef was a bit dry. The Rad Nar had very good flavor but I was a bit disappointed that I got normal broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli. Also the sauce was a bit too thick. The Pad Thai was very good. One of the few Pad Thai I actually liked at Thai restaurants around the valley.   Took off a star for the Rad Nar sauce being a little too thick. Will definitely come back to dine again!!",

    "text": "I visited this place today on the recommendation of a friend that it was legit Thai food. I was also told it was a tiny place, but to my delight, both were spot on and I was not disappointed in the least.   They have basically two areas to sit in, one is a tucked away corner on the left of the entrance, where a few booths line wall, the other is the main dining area, which is basically what you walk into when you pass through the front door. There are (literally) a handful of tables there, but they each seat about four people. Definitely a small place, but not uncomfortably small. I would call it cozy, at least until the gets really full, at which point it probably borders on tight quarters for most folks. I can also see how it would be a bit annoying to sit near the door, which an unsettling number of patrons were too silly to close behind themselves when entering. My advice? Go early and try to grab a booth to put some distance between yourself and the hustle-n-bustle.   So on to the food, tried a variety of dishes today and they were all fantastic. First up, appetizers -both the crab puffs and the chicken satay were outstanding. Flavorful, perfectly cooked and, in the case of the crab puffs, not at all greasy or heavy. The crab puffs are a good deal, as you get eight of them, which is more than enough for one person and plenty if you're sharing with a the rest of your table. For the entree, I went with their fried rice and chicken, which was great. The portion size, both of the chicken pieces as well as the fried rice, were generous and I did not want for more. Being a lunch special, it also came with an egg roll, which was pretty decent, and some wontons. Between the appetizers and the entree, I left well and truly full, which is always a good thing.   In terms of service, while there isn't a lot of staff, it was definitely a controlled chaos when it came to getting everyone what they needed. Our appetizers came out relatively quickly, followed in short order by the entrees, and even the drink refills were fairly prompt. I was pleasantly surprised, given that the tail end of our visit fell squarely into the lunch rush.   I will caution would-be diners that parking is a bit of a chore, so carpooling is highly recommended if you are visiting with friends or colleagues. It helps if you go early, but by the time you leave, the lot will invariably be approaching capacity and you'll end up in tight quarters. The orientation essentially means you have to back out towards the entrance, unless you can find a way to turn around. Not a problem in a small car, or when the lot is sparsely filled, but at the peak, it's another story. More free advice? If you go early, spend the time to turn around and back into your parking spot. When you come out to a full lot, you'll be glad you did.   Definitely a solid entry in the \"hole in the wall\" category, but this place has a lot of character and authentic food, so I'd gladly go back if I was in the area.",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite Thai food in phoenix right now. Chanpen on Broadway and the sister location on Baseline are amazing.  The Broadway location is my favorite because there is just something special about the food that comes out of that little unassuming building on the side of the road. However once you walk in and smell all those great thai flavors (curry, lemongrass, coconut, basil).  I have tried a bunch of different dishes here but my favorites are the Coconut Soup and Panang Curry along with the spring rolls. The coconut soup is one of my go to's on cold nights or when I am not feeling good. It's go such great aromatics and the combo of the spice with the sweet coconut is just great. I prefer mine with chicken which comes apart easy but the beef is good too and adds a bit more chew. The panang is awesome with the nutty spicy flavor. The sauce is good over just some rice. The spring rolls are a great little warm up to the main meal. They are pretty large for spring rolls with the fresh veggies and some good sized shrimp, the dipping sauce I can't get enough of either. I like that with their spring rolls the shrimp never have that weird overly shrimpy taste and aren't over cooked.  I've also had some of the other curry's, the larb salad, pad thai (girlfriends favorite) and a bunch of others and nothing has been a let down. So feel free to explore the menu.  The other big thing is service, the people here a great. I have only ever done takeout because it's so small inside but everyone is always friendly and are quick to hand you a bottle of water every time. A couple times when my order wasn't quite ready they have given me some green tea ice cream while I wait, totally unnecessary but a nice gesture.   For takeout they do one thing that I think is key for a place of this size which does takeout a lot, they package it up well. Everything is well secured and even when I am ordering soup I am never really worried about spills and leaks.  Protip: Ask about the specials when you call in they have some great seasonal dishes.",

    "text": "So that's what all the fuss was about.  Admittedly I'm not a huge Thai food fan, but I know a good operation when I see (and taste) it.  Chanpen's rave Yelp reviews got me in the door, the service kept me from leaving on a busy day, and the food will keep me coming back for more.  Call this another one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" tales.  Today's tale goes a little something like this.  I decided to give Chanpen a try on a Friday at lunch.  Through Yelp I'd seen that they have some decent daily lunch specials.  Fair enough.  I had hopes of dining in, but when I saw the parking lot was full, I knew I'd missed my window for that type of lunch.  I grabbed parking spot next door right up against what I believe is an old church building.  The line of people went out the door about 10 deep with a mix of people ordering take out and waiting for a seat.  The restaurant seats maybe 18 people inside (and I think I'm being optimistic) so I knew right away the takeout route was my only option if I wanted to get fed relatively quickly.  After about 5 minutes in line the woman at the register kindly greeted me and took my order.  I decided to go for the Pad Thai lunch special, level 2 spice (I know, I'm a wimp).  The specs:  stir fried noodles, chicken, shrimp, egg, onion, bean sprouts and ground peanuts.  Also came with an egg roll and fried wontons.  Total cost?  $7.  The woman said it would be about ten minutes and gave me a free bottled water while I waited.  Nice gesture.  I waited outside alongside about a half dozen other folks since the inside was packed.  Ten minutes later, sure enough the food was brought out to me and I was ready to go.  When I got home to sample the goods, I was first and foremost very impressed that the food came in a partitioned take out box.  In one part of the container was the Pad Thai and the other was the egg roll and wontons.  Great move as I was worried the egg roll and wontons would be soggy had they been commingled in the take out box.  The taste?  Phenomenal.  In theory Pad Thai is pretty hard to screw up (though I've been to Thai joints that have), but this was spot on.  The noodles were super tender and moist, there was lots of chicken and shrimp and was surprisingly hearty for a lunch portion.  The wonton and egg rolls were also perfectly cooked and rounded out the meal perfectly.  Tremendous value for the price you pay.  I will say that if you're coming here to dine in, it would seem like lunch is their busiest.  Not sure about dinnertime, but maybe that's a better bet if you're looking to get seated quickly.  Even though I went the takeout route, I was very impressed with the service I received and the timeliness of my order.  But even if every trip going forward here turns out to be a takeout trip for me, today's delicious experience tells me it'll still be worth it.",

We went here on a weekday roughly one hour before closing. My first impression was that the parking lot was super dark. They didn't have very good lighting. The outside of the restaurant did not look too fancy, a little on the shabby side. As I walked into the restaurant, there were two booth and four regular tables. We were the only ones dining in at this hour, but there were a good number of people ordering togo.   The food made up for that superficial notion. We had the drunken noodles with chicken level 3, which is equivalent to medium spice. The noodles were absolutely delicious. I also enjoyed the pineapple red curry with tofu & veggies, level 3 spice.  I might bump up the spice level to 4 next time to get a stronger kick.  Overall, there were adequate food portions, and everything was reasonably priced. The best part was getting free complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of our meal, which brought a huge smile to my face.   The service was outstandingly fast, efficient, and friendly. My food came out in a timely manner. I will definitely be returning when I'm around the area.",

We were immediately treated by the nice cashier. We decided to take the food to go since they would be closing soon. They had options on how hot you wanted your food. On a scale of one to 10 which I thought was great. However, I did not like the drunken noodles. It may be because I have never had this food before. But other than that the wontons and everything else was really good!",

Thank you in advance for everyone reviewing the place, because if I didn't read the reviews and just went here... I would have reversed and drove to back to work.  I have NO idea how they are able to fit a kitchen in this facility, but they make it work.  The place is very small, the place is smaller than 600 sq. ft. but they make it work with 2 booths and 3-4 tables.  Food was amazing, I got the tofu drunken noodles, spice level 3,and that was enough heat for me. I had heartburn afterwards but that is my fault for not taking an acid reducer prior to eating spicy food.  Other than this place being small, there are no complaints. My lunch was 7 dollars and that is cheaper compared to the other Thai resturants right off broadway because they charge 9 dollars for the same food.  The food was good and I would come again for lunch!",

Frankly the fact that a Thai restaurant exists in South Phoenix is a great treat so I was not going to be judgmental on the decor.   We ordered spring rolls and they were excellent as well as Thai iced tea (which is pretty much delicious everywhere you get it). I got the vegetarian Pad Thai and I am kind of picky about it, I don't like how a lot of restaurants prepare it but this was quite good. Especially of note was the server who asked me if it was ok to make it with eggs. I find a lot of servers don't seem to care about your dietary  needs or consider that someone might be a vegetarian or vegan...so bonus points for that. Our server was all around excellent and quite attentive (but to be fair we were dining at an odd hour and the only ones there). My friend got the drunken noodles and thoroughly enjoyed them, I had a bite it was quite good. Unfortunately I was much too full to try dessert, but I will definitely be going back.  I encourage everyone to go here and keep this place open!",

Its a small restaurant in a questionable neighborhood (leave your crown jewels at home). Our server was welcoming, friendly, and very helpful.  She helped me choose my level of spicy for my vegetable stir friend noodles.  Picked level 3.  It was spicy enough to experience tingling burning sensation around the lips, but still able to appreciate the natural flavors and fragrance from the chili peppers.    The noodle soup had a nice flavoring. You could taste the fresh cilantro, anise, sweet cabbages, lemon grass, and whole other goodness. Its the REAL deal. No bouillon or MSG or Knorr seasoning.   Fried Toasts were made differently here.  No complaints from me.  Light n' Crispy panko coating.  Great alone or with the sauce.  Sliced mango over sticky rice drizzled with coconut milk.  YUMMY.  Just look at the pix!   The server and cook/owner treated us like family.  Felt like we were at home eating mom's cooking.    Generous portion and reasonable price.  Plus, they play movies during lunch time.   Great food at a reasonable price + cool movies on dvd (got to watch Sky Fall and Avengers) = What more could you ask for?

It's a tiny little building randomly placed on Broadway, so it's very easy to miss.  But the food is the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix!  We had the Coconut Soup (Tom Kha Gai), Garlic Chicken, Drunken Noodles and Royal Curry with Chicken.  Everything was absolutely delicious and very, very fresh!   Chanpen is a GREAT addition to South Phoenix, and I hope it lasts!  I'll definitely be supporting it again.",

I have never been inside, always had a co-worker go get it. Outside looks run down, not the type of Thai food restaurant you would in that part of Phoenix.  I cannot recall what I had my 1st time there, only remembering running to McDonald's  after trying it. The second time I ordered beef Pad Thai. This is your typical Thai dish, usually one of the most favored of all their dishes.  I had the misfortune of taking several bites before throwing it away. The beef was extremely dry, the noodles soaked in oil, and overcooked. My egg roll was nothing special. The Thai tea tasted like powder. I even tried a colleagues soup, which was pretty bad (I saw oil floating at the top).  Stay away from this place.",

The hot pot soup was fantastic, and the lemongrass flavor was nicely balanced in the fragrant, warm, happy bowl. This is the sort of soup that could inspire good haikus. Yum! The coconut curry was appropriately spicy with a good amount of sweetness, and I thoroughly appreciate they WILL make the dish spicy when you indicate your spice level desired.",

The tom yum was incredible, and easily enough for 2-3 people as an appetizer. I ordered it 5/5 hot, and it was indeed 5/5 hot. The red curry was delicious, and not too thin (which I've noticed time and time again at many Thai restaurants). It is served with a generous portion of white rice which was cooked well. Last, as an added treat, free of charge, they brought out a small portion of green tea iced cream (if you haven't tried it, HIGHLY recommended). The service was fast and friendly.

We called in to make sure it was open on the holiday and they were! We ordered 3 things and they were all delicious!  The chicken skewers, a little dry but love the peanut sauce!  Pad see ew was good, lots of seafood!  Fried rice was my favorite, well seasoned and great tasting.  They provided us with great service and great food, thank you!",

    "text": "I love Chanpen. Yes it's a tiny hole in the wall restaurant, yes it unfortunately closes early at 8pm, and yes the parking lot is rather difficult to navigate during peak hours, but I'd gladly brave all of that for their amazing quality of food.   Service is always welcoming and courteous. It really drives the feeling of coziness to a new degree, especially as the restaurant seems to be converted from a house. There are fewer than ten tables inside, but everything is kept clean and organized even when there's a line out the door and endless phone orders for takeout.  Chicken larb: I've had so many versions of this dish, but I'm always looking for that fragrant lemongrass kick. Chanpen's rendition is delicious, with potent lemongrass, tartness from the lime, and crisp vegetables. The portion is generous, and though it's listed as a salad, I rather think there's more protein than anything else (which I love). The ground chicken is wok-tossed nicely so that it's not dry but still has that smoky hint of wok-fire. When I'm in the mood for a lighter dish, this larb would definitely be my go-to. I have to remember to ask if they have a beef version next time since I think that it might become my favorite dish here.  Chicken and shrimp pad thai:  Though standard offerings at a Thai restaurant, this is hands down the best I've found in Arizona thus far. The noodles are chewy and cooked perfectly so that they're not mushy, the proteins are permeated with flavor without being dry, and the sauciness is perfect. I like my pad thais on the saucier side, and Chanpen's version does not disappoint. The sauce is a great balance of sweet, savory, and vinegary. A lot of Thai restaurant go heavy-handed with the sweetness with not enough tartness to balance it out, so the dishes get sticky and heavy really fast. Chanpen's does not, and I enjoyed the flavor so much that I polished off the entire generous portion and felt stuffed for the rest of the day (worth it).  Royal yellow curry: Wow the curry here is phenomenal. I'm not exactly sure what makes it so good, but the flavor makes it hard to stop eating. It's creamy, flavorful, and just the right balance of rich and not heavy. Each curry dish comes with a side of steamed rice, which I appreciate since many restaurants require a separate order of rice on the side.   Crab fried rice: This dish is on the specials board, so I'm not sure if it's always offered. The crab is understandably canned, but the fried rice itself is a testament to great skill with a wok. There are crunchy onions, fresh green onions, and nicely slivered eggs to culminate in a really satisfying plate of fried rice. I had almost half the portion left over, and it tasted just as good -- if not better -- the next day.  To polish off every meal, there is a scoop of complimentary ice cream with the bill. It's a little thing, but a kind gesture I really appreciate. I can't foresee a time when I won't want to come back to Chanpen, and I can't wait to update this review with more tasty dishes in the future.",

Now, I have a severely suppressed immune system from leukemia and had a bone marrow transplant so I have to be very careful where I eat. But his friend from out of town was with us so I decided to try it.  OH.MY.GOD! The food was so good. It is the best Thai food in town. It was like eating my mom's cooking again. She started Siamese Kitchen back in the '80s and won best in Phoenix several times, so I know good Thai food. I had the garlic chicken, hubby had the chicken curry with potatoes and the friend had Pad Thai. The garlic chicken was so good I wanted to lick the plate clean. I tried some of the curry and it was really good too. The friend said the Pad Thai was some of the best he'd ever had.   It is a super long drive for me since I am way out in NW Peoria, but anytime I am near that part of town I will be going. I might have to make excuses to be in that part of town now.",

No kick really, but very flavorful. I also tried a bit of level 3 pad Thai without peanuts and whooooaaaaa my mouth was on fire for a good 10 minutes. Luckily I had the Thai iced tea which was a nice sweet to the spice and definitely helped cool , I'd say try to go in an hour before close.",

Tonight I called to place a take out order (probably my 15th time doing so) I actually live right at the baseline location and when I went to pick up my order I discovered that I had accidentally called the wrong location. I felt awful for making the other restaurant (Broadway) make my food and called them to let them know that I wouldn't be able to pick it up and I wanted to apologize. The way I was treated on the phone (the woman was obviously annoyed and told me that \"this once\" I could \"get away with it\" but I better make sure to call the right restaurant next time) made me completely lost my appetite for both locations. She literally hung up on me. Hopefully this message reaches a manager because I wasn't given the option to speak to one. I really wanted to apologize but now I just feel like I never want to go back.",

The server suggested I only get a 3-4/5 and he was right. It was perfect. I will definitely eat there again, but more likely as takeout since it is an easy drive on the way home from work.",

I would always order the Rad Nar which is the big flat noodles mixed in with your choice of meat. Pretty good. I also even had some friends try this place. We tried the seafood combo hot pot, drunken noodles, yellow curry, broccoli beef, noodle soup and their mango w/sticky rice.   EVERYTHING was amazingly delicious. We even got complimentary desert. They gave us fried banana with green tea ice cream and topped it off with a chocolate drizzle. That alone just made my meal that much better, The staff is great. They are laid back and their customer service is above average.   So, this place is the best place for thai food in Arizona. Been there so many times and it has never been disappointing. Strongly suggest giving this place a try.",

    "text": "I work in South Phoenix and it's very much a food desert for the intrepid soul who seeks something other than Jack in the Box for lunch. I was happy to see that there was a Thai place on yelp and tried it right away.  I really like Chanpen a lot--for starters, the food is great. I've tried a lot of things off the lunch menu, the red curry, yellow curry, spicy sweet basil, drunken noodles, and spicy fried rice. I was not disappointed by any of these. I also love the fact that there are five levels of spice, and if I order level 5, it's actually spicy! It clears my sinuses. Finding food that I actually think it spicy is really hard for me, and at least one of my five stars is for this reason alone.  I do think it's probably better to get take out than dine in here since the place is small. They are great at take out--they are extremely accommodating. If you have a bunch of cash from your office staff they will do each order separately and give you change individually. They will put one or two on a card and the rest cash. Anything you want--plus an extremely convenient box for your mass order of food and free water bottles. They're also pros at taking phone orders, I swear sometimes I'll call a pizza or other takeout place and the person on the phone is clueless and doesn't understand what I say--but for one, the number system of the lunch specials and spice level makes ordering easy, and for two, the staff is just good at what they do.  If you DO dine in for lunch, the cabbage soup is very tasty.  The price for lunch is excellent. The portion size is perfect for lunch and they give you quality over a quantity which yields leftovers. The little spring roll that comes with your meal is crisp and tasty. I've had beef and chicken in the lunch specials and they've both been delicious.  I definitely recommend Chanpen to anyone who wants Thai in the South Phoenix area, and also the Tempe-but-close-to-south-phoenix area.",

Complementary ice cream at the end was a nice surprise as well. It was exactly what I was looking for. It's a great little treat in the middle of nowhere. Very unassuming from the outside. This hole in the wall comes furnished with a secrion of small tables and a couple booths. Decorated with Muay Thai and Thailand posters and little odds and ends.",

It took awhile to get someone to take our order. Once they have it almost took almost 45 minutes for our meals to arrive. I was trying to enjoy my lunch but the booth had beaten backrest which some portions were covered in duct tape. When someone on the opposite side of the booth sat back, it push you forward which felt the backrest would eventually break. The food was ok. Nothing to rave about. The fresh rolls looked brown and dingy which we didn't finish. I'm a huge fan of Thai Food but felt this place fell short of fresh ingredients.",

Definitely not fancy, but great food and instant service.",

They do spices right, unlike other Thai places. So, spicy level 4 or 5 is actually pretty spicy. I think spicy level 3 is close to a level 5 at most other places. They gave us free ice cream at the end to cool it all off!  The ambiance is bit hole-in-the-wall but it's very much like eateries in Thai land -- so I love it.",

Started off with fried won ton that was very good (served 12 pieces!). Then had drunken noodles with chicken that had great flavor, spice and heat but the chicken was very tough.  So what bothered me. A fried brown mysterious pellet attached to the exterior of the won ton. I am not suggesting it was a rat dropping but then again I don't know what it was and that made me uncomfortable given the rickety condition of the place. The second thing that bothered me was their cooler - that's where they kept ice to insert in our water. But I asked myself we are drinking tap water and the front of the house staff were drinking from bottled water so we're they trying to tell us something?",

It's a very small place and you shouldn't expect anything fancy. The family that runs the place is very friendly. I tried the chicken larb, pad thai, and panang curry. The meat in larb was a bit dry but the flavors of all the dishes were on point and done very well. They will authentically spice it up for you if that's what you want so be careful with the heat scale. Complimentary dessert (we got green tea ice cream) is always appreciated. Check Chanpen out if you haven't for Thai. I think the difference between their food and other popular spots in town is quite noticeable.",

Ample parking. Not gorgeous from an architectural standpoint but interesting.  Ambiance: very simple inside. Decor is pretty cute. Honestly I liked inside - you can create your own ambiance depending on who you go with.  Service: very good. Everyone is friendly and attentive and my water glass never went empty.  Food: awesome. So fresh, so much great flavor. The pad Thai was so tasty, chicken wasn't dry by any means. Red curry was oozing with coconut milk goodness and basil and tofu. Chicken satay skewers were lightly spiced and juicy. Sticky rice with green tea ice cream was the perfect size and a wonderful end to a wonderful meal. Also loved the small container of super super spicy chilis on each table.  Price: very reasonable.  I will be back!",

The chicken was tender and lean, while the coconut milk gave the dish a hearty, rich quality.  The Thai peppers slowly but surely ratcheted up the heat to a bold but satisfying level.  This dish comes with well cooked side of steamed white rice.  The portion of rice wasn't huge, but turned out to be the perfect amount when I finished.  This dish also comes with a small bowl of the soup of the day.  The soup I had was good, but did contain some cabbage which isn't my favorite.  The broth was piping hot and flavorful, leaving the impression that it was a quality soup.  The egg roll that accompanies dish is tasty, but so small that it made me chuckle.  Lastly,  the size of this restaurant is too small.  It was completely full at 1:30 pm in the afternoon.  A table became available after 10 minutes, but groups over 4 will find they need luck on their side.",

I'm a big fan of Thai food, but this chef really had a gift. The red curry had a stronger basil taste than I am used to, and it melded perfectly with the spiciness, nuttiness, and light sweetness and bitterness of the dish. I normally order a 4 on the spiciness scale when I get Thai food, but I had read other reviews that said this place is on the spicy side. I played it safe, and got a 3 for the red curry and a 2 for the pad Thai, and was very happy with what I got. The pad Thai is unlike other versions of the dish I have tried, in that this chef's version has more tartness, which was a very pleasant complement to the curry. And once I literally could eat no more, after being reduced to the \"just one more bite\" mentality multiple times, they brought out free, delicious, homemade ice cream. I'm going to be raving about this place for a while. If I ever visit Phoenix again, I will most certainly be back!",

After we parked, we went inside where there are very few tables.  Even at the odd hour (2PM lunch), the place had a decent amount of people.  There were a few empty tables so we grabbed one.  By the time we figured out what we wanted and ordered, the empty tables were gone.  People were constantly coming in to pick up their takeout orders.  My wife ordered the drunken noodles with chicken.  I ordered the pad thai with chicken and shrimp.  After tasting the pad thai (a little sweet for my taste, but maybe they added a little too much sweetness that day), I tried my wife's drunken noodles.  Have you ever tried your spouse's dish and you didn't want to give it back?  Yeah, this was one of those days.  The fresh basil in these noodles is so refreshing.  We finished our leftovers as a second meal later that day.  The best part about the drunken noodles is they taste really healthy.  In fact, so healthy we felt hungry after eating them (like having salad healthy).  The pad thai was more filling, but it was a little sweet for me.  We ordered some vegetarian egg roll appetizers which were okay too.    Next time, I think we're both ordering drunken noodles with chicken!",

    "text": "Sometimes you find a gem where you may not be looking. Chanpen Thai is just that gem. Trust me, this place isn't really the place you view as being the beautiful one and it may throw you off by its seedy location. But, it's a True find and it has some of THE best thai food and service in the valley of the sun! Chanpen is very small and has only a few tables; you are greeted warmly with complimentary green tea ice cream or coconut ice cream and offered a drink, even for take out while you wait! There are daily specials that seem seasonal and the service is always with a friendly smile and helpful explanation, if need be. I've had the Penang Green Curry here with Chicken, ( my personal favorite !) ; The Pineapple Fried Rice is a large portion and great for sharing ; Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp; the Coconut Soup is loaded with fresh ingredients and perfect when you are under the weather or on a chilly winter day! I've never had a mediocre meal here. Everything is amazing! There are always leftovers too.. which I love! Most items are $10 and under!! You can vary the spice level and I go with a 3-4 and find myself grabbing tissues for the basic in me. But the heat level is never overpowering of the flavors. If you choose to dine in, there are only about 3-4 tables and no alcohol is served , but you can seemingly BYOB.  This particular location, ( there is a nicer and larger one located on Baseline Road), is my favorite. It may leave little to be desired on 'looks' from the parking lot to the street,  but it's huge on .. it's personality and that's what counts , right ? A diamond in the rough awaits your Thai desires right here !",

I'm just going to get right to it... the quality is comparable to the Thai places I've tried in Thai town, West Hollywood in LA and the food itself in Thailand! I'm obsessed. Chanpen can take all my money and I won't mind.  Parking: very limited. Tiny lot with about 10-15 spots. I haven't had trouble finding parking just yet, but just keep this in mind if you want to come by during lunch rush hour.   Ambience: if you are looking for a spot for date night with beautiful decor and a hip vibe. You're reading the wrong yelp review. This place is all about the business: bomb dot com FOOD. There's nothing fancy, seating is very limited, but baby, their food will win your heart.  FOOD REVIEW: (I've only had their lunch specials so far, great deals btw)  PAD THAI: the noodles was the perfect consistency. The flavor was on point. There was plenty meat and a massive shrimp. MY FAVE! RED CURRY: It was a pretty small portion, but it was so delicious I couldn't get enough.  DRUNKEN NOODLES: The noodles were a little to broken up for my liking, BUT the flavor was out of this world. Just the right amount of kick with pepper and onion and a sprinkle of heaven. SPICY SWEET BASIL: okay... I thought it paired well with the rice but it seems like something I can make at home. My friends loved it though.  Spice level: their spice level is legit, none of that toned-down for the \"general population\" weak sauce. I was so tired of ordering \"spicy\" here in AZ and nothing ever come out spicy... Chanpen will please all you spice-thirsty beasts out there. A good burn was definitely something i've been missing since Thailand.  CHANPEN, don't go anywhere... I will be back real soon!!!!",

At times the seating may all be taken, but the servers work you in, don't forget you. you get a large mug of water with ice and a nice soup as soon as you are seated. Severs will explain the menu.  There is a condiment table to obtain extras and sauces. Good workers, and if the guys are cooking, you get the right taste! Am sure the food served is fresh, which is better than many other places.  Recently have been changing to Thai Red Curry. Never disappointed. Good portion and usually get a good dose of vegetables with the dish.  Truly one of the freshest and tasty Thai and will keep coming back.",

First off, if you can, try this place during the off hours as the restaurant is small with limited seating and limited parking. Think Mom-n-Pop. Even with the long lunch line (that should tell you something) and limited seating, it was well worth the wait.  All three dishes were visually appealing, and the shrimp was cooked correctly. The shredded vegetable in the egg rolls have the impression that the were made fresh and not overcooked (too many other places have mush in the center of their egg rolls).  My pineapple fried rice was tasty and authentic. My wife thought that her pad Thai was a little on the sweet side. Our friends pepper steak had the best flavor of the three.  Service was relatively quick given how busy they were. Staff was very attentive.",

I popped in here for lunch after landing at PHX last weekend and from the outside I never would've known I was at the right spot. It's definitely a hole in the wall type place but don't let that fool you. The food is amazing and tastes authentic!  I wish I had taken pics, but I had the pineapple red curry with rice and every bite tasted fresh and authentic. You can choose spice levels from 1-5. 2 was a good level that didn't feel spicy, but I'll probably go for a 3 next time. Their noodles and soup dishes also looked delicious and I'll be sure to try them next time.   The restaurant seems family run, and I love supporting local businesses! The food is priced so fairly. For under $15 I had a delicious meal in good company, with enough leftovers for another meal. Keep in mind that seating is limited so consider take out if you can't get a table!  Final cherry on top - they serve complimentary fried banana with green tea ice cream. For a restaurant this popular, they have absolutely no need to do that but I love how customer-oriented they are! Bonus points in my book.   I recommend this place to anyone who wants REAL Thai food in PHX cuz I haven't found any other places yet that even come close. Can't wait to try more of their dishes and their Tempe location too!",

People really like them. Also, super nice folks; very polite, great smiles. Plus, the guy gave me a free water bottle for no apparent reason other than kindness. Idk if that is custom here but I thought that was just such a nice gesture. We live in a desert. They get it. That's character right there.  In terms of the food, my pad thai was tasty. Very tasty. I ordered a level 4 out of 5 spicy and I definitely wish I went full spice (I am also kind of a psycho-spice-o-oo-yah-yah-type of guy). So, if you can handle heat, I would recommend believing in yourself and aiming high. And, though I may enjoy other Thai restaurants in the Valley more, I don't think any of them can beat the price at Chanpen.   Thus, much respect, guys. Thank you for a wonderful meal",

I called in a to go order and asked my usual \"do the currys contain any fish sauce or paste?\"  Well this time he replied \"yes, they all have some kind of fish sauce or paste in them.\" Needless to say I'm devasted after years of them saying \"O yes. It's vegetarian. No fish sauce. Don't worry.\"  I've been eating here for over 4 years at both locations. I have been lied too at lots of Thai places and I am sad the one I trusted the most let me down.   If you're vegetarian or vegan do NOT come here.   Again, vegan or vegetarians I would not step foot in here. I would also beware if you have ANY kind of allergy. They cannot accommodate it truthfully.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews I was expecting a bit more. This is a hole in the wall restaurant in a crappy part of town which typically equates to good food. Upon entering we were warmly greeted by a huge number of flies and a friendly staff member.   On to the food.. The Khao Soi I ordered had massively overdone noodles to the point where they were dissolving, but on the plus side the broth tasted good albeit massively thick and not typical of this dish. I also ordered the Pad Thai which in my opinion is a staple of any good Thai joint. However, this was by far the worst I have ever had in any Thai restaurant anywhere.. The first indicator the dish wasn't going to be good was that it was swimming in a very orange sauce that coated everything. The sauce was so so so sweet that I couldn't take more than a few bites, and my wife who is Thai couldn't eat it. Also I found a large piece of plastic in the noodles that must have fell in during cooking so that pretty much sealed the deal on this place.   Aside from this and the massive amount of flies that outnumbered patrons and wizzed past out table every few minutes this place was ok :).  How this place could have so many good reviews is beyond me. Maybe the demographic or area has something to do with it perhaps and explains why the food is overly sweet and Americanized.",

Chanpen Thai Cuisine looks like a hole in the wall,  in the middle of a random street, not around other businesses, however, the food is really very good. I guess the old saying is True you can't judge a book by its cover.  The restaurant is super small. There is only about four or five tables and this place gets crowded real quick. However, the staff are friendly, accommodating, and want you to enjoy your dining experience.  Everything we ordered was delicious and had a very authentic taste. The chicken satay, the Pad Thai,  spicy noodles and beef curry were all flavorful and delicious.   I stuffed myself to finish- some of the best Thai food I've had in a very long time.",

The filling flavor was there but the actually shell was over cooked and burnt. It was almost as if you were biting into Hardtack cracker. Not the most enjoyable thing to eat but it's there if your starving to death.   Overall, the experience was great and would recommend eating here. I giving this place 4 stars for less meat and burnt crab puffs.",

She then brought a bit of candy for my older daughters once they had finished their respective plates (first checking with me if that was okay).

If you also work around the Broadway and 32nd Street area and have been disappointed for years by the lack of quality restaurants in the area do yourself a favor and try Chanpen Thai.  The dining area is a bit small/limited in seating, so if going with a larger party for lunch try to get there early.  They also deliver.",

What we hoped would be a rare family dinner out (our son was even on his best behavior) ended up turning into a takeout experience. We were too hungry to wait behind another group for one of the very few tables. No biggie -- I just wish I had been better warned that it's tough to get a table here.  Our takeout order was ready in a little over ten minutes, maybe fifteen, and the server/cashier offered us a couple of complimentary bottled waters as we waited. So we were impressed with the friendly service and good communication from the kitchen. We ordered a couple of noodle dishes, including pad thai, as well as a curry entree. All were excellent, with subtle yet flavorful sauces and veggies cooked just right. We shall return soon and try the dine-in experience, maybe on a weeknight.",

We decided there was no better day than May Day and set out for our culinary adventure.  We agree with other reviewers that the neighborhood is questionable and that the restaurant is cozy, but don't let that stop you from experiencing some of the best, most affordable Thai food in the Valley!  He ordered Pad See Ew with beef, spice level two, and I had Red Curry with chicken, spice level three.  Both dishes were quickly prepared and were divine.    The service was professional, but what impressed us most was that the chef personally stepped out to check on how we enjoyed the meal.  For this, as well as for the delectable dishes, we'll definitely be back again ... and again ... and again!

They gave each member of our family a scoop of green tea ice cream while we waited for our food! Food was well packaged and came with everything we needed which was helpful since we were going back to our hotel to eat our dinner.   This place is a hidden gem that is kind of squeezed in between a residential neighborhood. Without Yelp, we probably would have never discovered this place.

Well, having lived most of y life in San Francisco AND lived in Bangkok for a while, I can say this is easily without doubt, as good as you can expect it to get for Thai in Phoenix.   Chanpen is the real deal, and while not the best Thai restaurant I have been to in my life, it is absolutely fantastic and offers the a genuine, authentic Thai experience for those who know their way around the block and know how to order authentic Thai.   Try the Kapow Gai and ask if they have Chinese broccoli ( hit and miss). It's great to add some veggies! And the Tom Yum is excellent and another MUST HAVE dish would be the Larb Gai, but be sure to ask they make it Thai style - with cabbage and NOT lettuce (YUK)! That's how the dish is intended to be eaten.   Nothing fancy here at all, and the place is small and unpretentious. But service is good and staff friendly. Come with friends and eat Thai style - family style and you won;t be dissapointed.",

I ordered fairly quickly and my vegetable Pad Thai arrived in about 10 minutes. It was still steaming profusely! I chose 4/5 spice level and it wasn't initially hot but the server brought me both crushed red pepper flakes as well as a bottle of chili paste.  This was a very well done dish, it was sweet but it actually worked with the heat that slowly built with each bite. Ooh it was a beautiful experience. The nice man asked if I was doing okay and said he wanted to bring me some green tea ice cream and even asked if dairy was okay (also asked if tofu and eggs were okay in my dish, so thoughtful.) He had such a great attitude, 10/10. That dessert was one of the best I've ever had, it was topped with chocolate syrup and peanuts and had a chunk of FRIED BANANA in it. And it was complimentary, so kind. Even the gentleman waiting for his takeout order received a bowl to enjoy.   If the Pad Thai was this fab, I can only imagine how the rest of the dishes are. I should come back with people and a bigger appetite!",

But you should give it a chance! It's DELICIOUS!!! We ordered shrimp fresh rolls with peanut sauce, chicken drunken noodles (spice level 2), a side of white rice, and the coconut mango sticky rice dessert. We also got a complimentary scoop of coconut ice cream with chocolate sauce and peanuts. It was the best coconut ice cream I've ever had! Our food came really fast and was SO flavorful and fresh. It literally couldn't have tasted better. The two spice level was perfect for us, with a little chili hot sauce on the side. If you like it pretty spicy I recommend a 3/5 spice level or higher. The people that work here are so nice and welcoming. I imagine they do a lot of take out orders. There's less than 10 tables inside. But the food is the BEST. You simply can't beat the price and quality.",

The panang curry is good but a bit sweet for me. If I can add a bit of fish sauce, that would be perfect. The complimentary ice cream at the end is lovely and I did not see any other restaurants did this anymore.",

With every feeling of your favorite greasy spoon--a greasy chopstick?--you will be immersed in the rich flavors and  homemade joy that only a place like this can cook up. Looking for a suggestion? Royal (yellow) curry with chicken. I was greeted with big smiles, served with efficiency and care, ate like it was my last meal--savoring it all, and my mouth is still tingling 15 minutes after I sadly parted with my empty plates. Honestly, I don't feel that I can give this place enough of a good review! I'm tongue-Thai'd (there I go again...). I know you're already on your way here after reading the first few words of this review, so enjoy!",

My company had pineapple fried rice and it was presented in a beautiful mound of yellow rice decorated in cashews and pineapple. Both of us were thrilled with our dishes. It was cooked perfectly, came out quickly and the staff were prompt and friendly. We got fried bananas and green tea ice cream for dessert. Does it get better? The healthy sized portions, I assumed would have to be taken in a to go box, but before I knew it I was slurping down the last noodle. Too good to postpone the next bite. It's not far from the airport so if you're local or you're just traveling in, it's worth the trip. Go sample some greatness.",

Don't worry though, if you can't handle spicy foods, you are in luck. Chanpen allows you to choose the level of heat in your dish from 0-5, and with that option, anyone can enjoy a meal at any level of heat they choose!   They say that some of the most wonderful gifts come in small packages and Chanpen is truly an unexpected and wonderful gift! Be prepared to squeeze yourself into a tiny parking lot off of Broadway Road, and into an even tinier restaurant at that. The accommodations may be minuscule, but trust me when I say that the flavors are huge!!! It may seem small and unassuming, but it will surely please your tastebuds as well as your pocket.  The curry is one of my favorites dishes to have here. I've tried the yellow and the green curry, and both were phenomenal. Packed with so much flavor and goodness too! You can try some for yourself for a great price, since their lunch specials allow you to enjoy a flavorful dish of curry, rice, won tons, and spring roll for about $8! Most recently, I tried the Thai Toast and chicken satay with peanut sauce and I was very happy I did. The mango sticky rice was great too, except it had waaaaay too much sauce for my liking; the next time I'll just request a light drizzle ahead of time. The complimentary green tea ice cream was the cherry on top of my most recent visit to Chanpen - so good!   Thank you Chanpen for always delivering delicious, quality, flavorful food! I am a big fan!",

The inside is not much and small. However, the food speaks to five stars of a rating. I ordered the Pad See Ew, it was delicious! I had the option of spice #2 and it was mild. The dish was not like other Thai restaurant that I've dined at that they make it very sweet by mixing palm sugar on the dishes. This restaurant is a dive. That's why there are many patrons dining at this restaurant because the food is good!",

    "text": "My fiance and I ate here last night.  We were incredibly surprised by how wonderful this place is and will for sure be our go to place for Thai food.  Meal:  Won ton soup, fried rice with chicken (little spiciness), fresh rolls, and red curry with tofu (extreme spiciness).  We also ordered two Thai ice teas.  Taste:  Each appetizer and entree was the best version of that dish out of every Thai restaurant my fiance and I have been to in Phoenix.  It was very evident the food was fresh.  The requested \"spicy level\" was dead on.  I have noticed that screwing up the \"spicy level\" is the easiest way to detract people from eating Thai food.  10 out of 10.  Value: The dish was prices were fair and reasonable.  The prices were commensurate with the portion sizes.  There was nothing jaw dropping about the value of the meal, but hey, quality always takes precedence over quantity, right?  3 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The waitress, who claimed to be the owner's daughter, was extremely friendly, polite, knowledgeable, and punctual.  She was attentive.  The service was just as good, if not better, than the food.  In terms of cleanliness, nothing indicated that it wasn't clean.  10 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  The place itself is very tiny.  There is maybe 5 or 6 tables in the entire joint.  Very little art work.  This place is for eating good Thai food and nothing more.  It is not in the best of neighborhoods, but that it is what it is.  3 out of 5.  Overall:  This place isn't for a date night.  Its not a place to celebrate a major accomplishment at work or school.  It is for eating excellent Thai food with a no thrills, relaxed atmosphere.  Because of the concise, but still excellent, menu, this is a great place for people new to Thai food to stick their big toe in the water, per se.  26 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars.",

When I got home and tasted it, I was blown away! Green curry chicken, Sweet basil chicken and Tom Yum soup. All had great flavor, cooked and seasoned perfectly.

    "text": "Thanks again to all the yelpers for finding me another great place to dine. That said, it may not be in the best area, but I would not say it's the ghetto. It is a pink house turned into a restaurant, next to an empty lot, on the south side of Broadway rd. Yes is it by low income housing for sure; but I was half expecting to be running to the entrance from my car, from some of the descriptions.    Okay now that's out of the way,  let's talk food. My party order several things, something we like to do when trying a new place. We started with the chicken satay and fried tofu, both good just not what I expecting.  Next we got chicken Pad Thai, Pad see-yaw (totally spelled wrong) and a Pan Ang curry dish. All were tasty. My only complaint was the Pad Thai serving seemed small for dinner time. The other food servings seemed like a fair value. One person in the party got Thai iced tea, now that was yummy and super sweet. At the end, the owners brought us some free fried bananas with chocolate sauce drizzled on it,  also good. I would go back again.   On another side note,  though it was small, we went on Saturday night at 630pm and we were their only customers, so I am guessing they get busy at lunch (on the weekdays), based off most of the previous reviews saying that it is super busy.  Also, thank you to the yelper that suggested level three spicy, it was just right.",

OMG, the food and the service were out of this world. We ordered the Panang curry and Pineapple curry. Some of the best curry we've ever had!!! The place is very small (only two booths and four tables). My only complain is their bathroom is in need of some serious remodeling (it was a bit gross). But the food was so good that I would absolutely come back when I visit Phoenix again.",

The green curry with chicken was delicious, just the right consistency of curry broth, super fresh veggies and tender flakes of chicken served over yummy rice.  I had the Mango juice with it, and they treated me to a scoop of Green Tea ice cream afterwards because it was so hot outside.",

We orded 3 dishes, the drunken noodle, the pai thai, and the beef salad. The waiter, aka 1 man does all, he's the cashier, the bust boy, the order man. Omg, it take forever for him to come to our table & take the order, the next worst part is the food take about 40minutes to come. Omg, & the worst part is the food is so horrible, the noodle in the pai & the drunken noodle was all mushy/over cooked. The meat in all the dishes are not fresh & tasted weird. The beef salad was sooo salty. It's very pricey & it is the worst Thai food I have ever eat. Omg, what a wasted of money & time.  I will never never stop by here ever again when I'm in the area. They need to improve the food or shame on them for calling those horrible dishes Thai food.",

To start with, the place is a whole in the wall with almost no parking, so the stress and annoyance of getting jammed in to a parking during lunch is not worth it. I went there at 11:25 PM on a Wednesday and it was packed. I ordered egg rolls and chicken pad thai. The place is so small, you're running in to every human being, every purse, every chair- it's a circus. There's no place to stand and order or to wait- unless you want to wait outside in the heat. I waited 50 minutes. This might have been worth it if the food was good but it was the worst  Thai food I'd ever tasted. The pad thai was bland- didn't have any flavor and was missing essential ingredients- no peanuts, green onions, bean sprouts, etc. The rolls were even worse- they were basically empty but even the pastry part wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend coming here ever. There are tons of other good Thai restaurants.",

Everything tasted great and plenty of water and even complimentary green tea ice cream to finish.",

I've had pad thai throughout Phoenix and Tucson probably 8 times in the past 3 months and found myself consistently disappointed. I just landed at Phoenix Airport and was starving. It just so happened that Chanpen Thai Cuisine was the closest Thai restaurant- thank goodness. Because I was there on a Monday during lunch hours, I got a free soup, egg roll, and wonton chips, all very delicious. There were probably 4 other parties aside from me yet my food came out within 6-8 minutes- impressive. On a scale of 1-5 for spiciness, I got a 3 and was very pleased. I always feel like I'm playing Goldilocks and the three bears when it comes to my heat, but this was absolutely perfect. The best part of the pad thai had to be the chewiness. I just can't say enough about it. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is craving authentic Thai food!",

I have been harassing my hubby to high heavens to get Thai with me since I've never eaten it and I finally found a place with very good reviews. The waiters explained the food to me and were very pleasant and welcoming. They gave me pointers on what to order so we went with something new and something familiar.   So. We ordered Pad Thai and Sweet and Sour chicken. Pad Thai was delicious- and the lime just raised the flavors higher and seriously made my mouth hum with happiness. And I love me some peanuts in food so this was great. Sweet and sour chicken was sweet and I loved loved the cucumber and tomatoes in it- seriously awesome sauce. The food came out fresh and was flavorful and felt like I was tasting authentic flavors. To me, the worst thing you can do with food is leave it bland and there was nothing bland here. Totally will return- maybe even try their new location in Tempe.",

As for the food, Pad Woon Sen, yuck, they put that canned sliced bamboo in it. Bamboo is not food for humans. Only for panda bears. The rest of the dish was lacking in all flavor and, considering I got the veggies only version of the dish, there were very few veggies in it.   But on the plus side, there was a lot of noodles and the portion overall was big.  Based on the flavor profile, I would not go back here. Smile Lao Thai is much, much better for the same $10.70 noodle dish.",

Oh and we got free ice cream! How cool is that!?!",

When I picked up, I was charged $2 extra because they gave me tofu and extra shrimp instead of chicken. The server was apologetic about charging it. Ok, fine although I would appreciate being informed when I placed the order. When I opened it, there was no tofu, 4 shrimps in it, and not spicy at all. My friend also asked for medium spicy on her pad thai and it was not spicy at all. So why bother asking how spicy we wanted? The noodle is a bit soggy but pretty good overall. Since it's nearby my office and there's no other Thai place nearby, I will give it another try. Please do not disappoint me the second time.",

I chose chicken as my meat, which was  juicy breast meat.  The wonton soup is fresh tasting, with pork dumplings, chunky vegetables, and savory broth.. I will be getting that to go each time I visit, which will be often.  My friend ordered the yellow curry, which I tasted, and that was amazing!  They give you the choice of heat from 1-5, and it is consistent time after time, unlike other Thai restaurants whose heat factor varies, depending on the chef that is working that particular day.  The egg rolls are crispy and full of flavor.  Now that I have tried them, they are a must.  When we went, going only due to the Yelp reviews, we noticed there was only one car in the parking lot, joking as we walked in, that It was the cook's car.  We were wrong....it was the cooks and the owners and the server's!  This mom and daughter team do it right.  They comped us a desert...phyllo wrapped condensed milk...I know, I know sounds awful..but get ready for a party in your mouth!  You must try it!  The owners are from Thailand, which makes for authenticity, and I must say, are some of the  most gracious, appreciative business owners I have come across.  Don't let the location and modest appearance of this treasure fool you or keep you away.  Go....you won't be sorry.",

I also had the Thai vegetables spring rolls they were outstanding try them you will not make a mistake.

I ordered the chicken pad Thai level 4 spicy and chicken spicy fried rice level 4 spicy. Now, I like spicy and this was f-ing spicy!!!! My mouth was a little bit on fire but I didn't mind one bit. There was plenty of chicken and so much flavor in both dishes. You know how some Thai places are bland and there is hardly any meat?? Well, not this place I will be back for sure!",

    "text": "I'm typically the one finding the places to eat with friends - it's no different with colleagues. A bunch of us were on a business trip in Phoenix and needed a place to lunch.   I pulled out my trusty Yelp iPhone app and saw that there was a 4.5 star rated Thai place less than a mile away - how had we missed it until now?  As we drove towards it, the surroundings shifted - a sensation I've experienced many times growing up in LA. Yes my friends, we were entering the ghetto. Key indicators included:  * disproportionally high number of check cashing/liquor stores per capita * excessively sagging guy at bus stop * slow moving angry looking guy on bicycle  We passed Chanpen on the first go-around - it was tiny and rickety. We u-turned and parked. Looking at the place, I couldn't imagine fitting a full sized commercial kitchen inside, let alone places to sit and eat.  I started to second guess myself - where had I brought my colleagues? I looked up, thinking of the 4.5 star rating, and the 5-star elite member reviews - I walked confidently towards the door with Yelpy resolve.   When we got inside, it became clear that large parties didn't frequent Chanpen (I think they do a large volume of their business by delivery). It took tetris like skill for the waitress to get some tables arranged so all 7 of us could sit together.   I ordered the red curry lunch special, with fried tofu and brown rice ($6.50).   While I waited, I had a hot tea - it came in the largest tea mug in history, and tasted like warm Thai tea nix the sugar and condensed milk. I henceforth dubbed it the \"skinny thai tea.\" It was awesome.   When the food came, we were all impressed, it looked very fresh and well presented. But man oh man, when I tasted my first bite of red curry tofu and brown rice, I nearly traveled to another world. The food was so light it almost floated, but somehow the flavors were so rich and balanced I could get lost in them. Everything was so fresh I swore they grew it out back.   I was shocked, but it all started to come together - 4.5 stars on yelp for a slanty shanty mid-ghetto? Yes... yes absolutely. I've eaten at a lot of Thai places - this may be the best yet.  The service was also superb - super warm and friendly.   I will come here every chance I get.",

If you get the level 5 spicy, it'll really make you sweet. I love how they have their sauces in bottles on the table so you can put as much or little as you want. They had sweet and sour, soy, their spicy house sauce (so I think), pepper seeds, and maybe something else. Also appreciated their super temperature hot and ready wonton soup as you look over the menu. All their lunch specials were around $7 to $8.  Service was quick, courteous, and personal. Their English was very easy to understand if you have trouble understanding different accents.  The only reason why I knock off a star is the size of the dining space and the general appearance of the outside. It's a very small seating space with tables for 4 at the greatest. The outside looks very run down (banners faded and not quite secured, just a general old look to it). If it wasn't for Yelp reviews, I would have driven right by this place since I don't associate good food with dunky looking places. But I'm glad I came and will stop by the next time I'm in the Phoenix area.",

Or is the universe out to get them?   Whatever their misfortune, I can say that my first experience with Chanpen was quite fortunate indeed. I was stuck at home all day with a cold and wanted Thai food desperately. I've literally lived in South Phoenix for 4 years and have never tried this place! I called to order take out and it was ready in 15-20 min.   It was easy to locate and the place was quaint and cute inside. The woman who answered the phone was the same person at the counter and she was quite nice. She gave me a complimentary bottle of water with my order.   I got green curry, because it's my favorite Thai dish and I am very picky about it. The only other place in town I like is Thai Basil on University. But, the green curry at Chanpen was delicious! It was thick and creamy, just as I like it. And the vegetables were cooked to perfection. I ordered a mild spiciness and it came just perfectly for me. Great first impression. Will definitely be back for more.",

I have never had Green Pineapple Curry, but the person I spoke to on the phone described what I was going to experience, flavor-wise, perfectly. I ordered it with Mussels, and I got SO MANY. For Seafood eaters out there: You know it's a total bummer when you get like 5 total pieces of seafood because the restaurant wants to skimp.  Also, no issues with time here.

Not just any thai food, but down and dirty, authentic thai food somewhere that looks like you stepped into someone's million year old thai grandma's kitchen. This place took the cake!! It is off the beaten path and the neighborhood looks like you want to park near a window so you can watch your car. We pulled up to the building and it was essentially a shack, which is exactly what I wanted! We were seated straight away along with anther table or two.  Their menu was tattered and indescriptive and I got excited in only the way a tiny, dive thai restaurant can do to me. I got a red curry with tofu and veggies at 4/5 spicy. My hubby got pad thai with shrimp and chicken at 5/5 (he is brave!). We waited almost no time when our food came out. Generous portions and gorgeous presentation greeted us. C dived into his food and was astounded by the melody of flavors of a perfect pad thai. The coconutty, curried broth was delicious and the tofu and veggies swimming in it were tender and moist. We shoveled in our food and even had a bit to take home. Next time I am in the Phoenix area, I am going all the way to this place even if it is across town! Possibly the #1 thai food I have ever had!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Hate to be the 5-star Debbie Downer, but I can't justify giving this place 5 stars, or even 4.5.  Based upon our experience I'm even a little leery with a full 4 stars but I'll keep it there, based upon great, friendly service and complimentary ice cream to finish.  A nice touch.  So why not 5 stars?  I can't say this place comes even close to the best Thai I've ever had in the country and arguably, not even in the Valley.  (See Yupha's Thai Kitchen.)  My wife and I ordered the papaya salad (2 spiciness), pad thai and massaman curry (3 spiciness).  The papaya salad was quite good and despite the 2, pretty spicy.  Not the best (that was in Vegas), but good.  The massaman curry was also tasty, but given the 3 spiciness, was hoping for a little more heat.  But the curry was well balanced, nice and rich, plenty of meat.  The pad thai was what fell so short.  Overpoweringly sweet, not enough tamarind or heat to balance it out.  Had the meal been based on the pad thai alone, this would have been a 2.5 to 3-star rating.  But everything else we had was tasty and out in a flash.  Bonus points for portions - they are generous here, so the value is excellent.  I suspect, though, that the mass of 5-star reviews comes from the effect of a skewed population sample, a lowering of expectations.  This hole-in-the-wall looks terrible, in one of the worse neighborhoods of Phoenix.  With the very above-average food coming out of here, I think it gets the bump of beaten expectation.  Again, this place is good and we'll be back, but it is not the best Thai in the State, and lags far behind the best Thai in the country.",

Do not let the outside appearance scare you off  - as they say, you cannot judge a book by its cover and it is so True about this restaurant!!!  I was here with 3 of my friends for lunch on a Saturday, two of them had never eaten Thai food before.  We all loved it! Unfortunately for us we live in Tucson but we have all said we will be back!  I love love love spicy food so I was happy to see at the top of their menu they had a 0-5 spice level when ordering.  I told the waitress that I wanted my food to be a 10 if possible.  :-)  She said no problem and then came back to me after bringing our order to the kitchen and asked if I wanted my food \"Thai style with Thai chilis\"  - YES PLEASE!  Wow, I was so happy when I got my food!  The drunken noodles were amazing!  I can hardly wait to go back and take my husband this time.  This is a hidden gem for sure!",

Ordered the Pad see ew which came within minutes.  The flavor was just off the mark.  Not sure if they forgot a few ingredients is the sauce, or didn't let the sauce caramelize properly.  That didn't bother me until I started to look into the kitchen.  The ceiling around the vent had grease-cicles hanging from it and the rest of the ceiling looked like it hadn't been cleaned for years.  So I started to watch the staff in the kitchen, definitely some serious basic food handing training was need for all.  Eat at your own risk.",

I've had plenty of Thai food but this is by far the best I've had in Phoenix. There is a great vegetarian option for almost all the dishes according to my very helpful and attentive waiter. Also they have an amazing lemongrass soup.   The actual place is super small and intimate. This is not a fine dining establishment. It's total \"hole in the wall\" which I find are the best restaurants.   Basically EAT HERE IF YOU WANT ONE OF THE BEST THAI MEALS IN PHOENIX! :)",

We ordered pot stickers for the kid, and they brought him out an egg roll too. He decided soy sauce was his be favorite flavor and so he ate a ton of their rice too. The rice was the best too, just sticky enough and not dry. The pot stickers came with an incredible sauce I couldn't get enough of! And I ate half the egg roll and it was the best I've ever had.  We ordered curry and pad Thai. The pad Thai I ate was flavorful and sweet, definitely my favorite pad Thai I've ever had. The spice really caught up to be though which surprised me because it was only level 2. And my husband devoured his curry and loved it.",

I went with a friend last week and we got a yellow curry, red curry, and their pad thai (sorry can't remember the dish numbers). Though the red curry was good and the pad thai was great, what blew me away was their yellow curry. Definitely one of the best Asian dishes I've had in AZ for a long time.

    "text": "Best Thai food I've ever had.    I'm more of a fan of various regional Chinese cooking, but I found out that the reason for that is I had not gotten to Chanpen Thai Cuisine until recently!  Once I had THEIR food, I realized what I had been missing.  We go to the Broadway, Phoenix location, and that is what this review references.  Our three favorite dishes are the Lemon Grass Soup (otherwise known as Tom Yum Soup), the Crispy Chicken (from the chalkboard specials on the wall near the cash register) and the Spicy Sweet Basil Stir Fry.    You have a choice of meats in the soup and the stir-fry, so choose your favorite -it really doesn't matter.  They're all good.  The Lemon Grass Soup has a rich, homemade broth and a wonderful and aromatic lemon grass kick.  I LOVE Tom Yum, and this is easily the best I've ever had.  Truly tastes like your Thai Grandma would've made!  Crispy Chicken is fried crisp and tossed with a sauce that'll make you a believer with the very first bite.  How can I say this?  It tastes EXACTLY like you want it to.  Spot on.  Tangy.  Hot.  Savory.  Sweet.  You know that aroma that's in the air outside a good Asian restaurant?  The smell that tells you they're 'doing it right'?  Well, that's what this dish TASTES LIKE!  Woo hoo!  The Spicy Sweet Basil stir-fry has plenty of the key ingredient and it gets right down to business on your palate.  Spicy sweet it is, yes, but the depth of flavor is excellent.  Can't miss with this one.  We've also eaten their curries, which are served in deep bowls and are quite good.  There is one that is super rich and creamy with coconut milk.  I believe it is the Pa-Nang Curry.  Luxuriously rich, and almost too heavy, but very, very good.  The red, green or yellow curries are not as thick and rich, but are good nonetheless.  I could go on, but... if you like Thai food, I'm sure you get the idea.  Plus, the location and facilities are sketchy as they come. (It's a \"plus\" because I love 'sketchy' places.)  If you're skittish, go during mid-to-late afternoon.   Daylight.  Don't do lunch at peak hours.  Crowded, and they only have a half-dozen tables.",

The lunch rush is always busy, which is I why I almost always do takeout, but the service is always great, everybody is very polite and extremely accommodating to any special requests, and the pad Thai is like somebody took a rainbow and put it through a pasta maker and then added in the most authentic Thai seasonings, and then topped with sprinkles of heaven. Be careful with the heat though- I LOVE spicey, but if I go to 5 on the spice, I end up with a runny nose and turning red haha. It's SO GOOD!

The staff was really sweet, I got a Thai iced tea.... and at the end of the meal he asked me if I wanted more (which of course I said yes), but I asked if he could place it in a to go cup and he said of course!

I'm not sure if that's just what comes with meals, but that ice cream was awesome. Pretty sure it was coconut.  I ordered the chicken pad thai (level 4 spice) and egg rolls. The pad thai was great - level 4 wasn't that spicy for any spicy food lovers. I'll have to go 5 next time. Egg rolls were okay, not the best.

I was able to add more chili to get it to the spice level I wanted. My friend and I also ordered fried tofu and fried wontons. Both were super delicious. The wontons came with a sweet sauce and the tofu had a sweet and spicy sauce. At the end of our meal our waitress gave us some complimentary coconut ice cream. I'm personally not a fan of coconut, but this ice cream was super delicious. I definitely will be coming back.",

    "text": "This is a ghost update. My last visit to this location was for certain some time in April2015.  I am writing this updated review based on all of my frequent and many times dinning at Chanpen Thai Cusine. You may be asking what's prompting this sudden desire to update my review for a place that I haven't visited in over 2 years. The reason is I no longer live in Arizona. I never thought that I wouldn't find a Thai restaurant as good as Chanpen. But that is precisely what has happened. I searched and I have not encountered any Thai food as good as Chanpen.  It took me a certain period of time trying different Thai restaurants. To come to the conclusion. The best I left behind in PHx;  Was Chanpen and I have yet to find one that is as good. The reason for this is. The owner Chanpen is a Lady that cares what Go's on each plate and won't let any food leave her kitchen if it does not meet her high standards This is very evident from the fact that whenever we would eat at Chanpen she would almost always come out of the kitchen and asks us how was the food. Also we would all always asks for less salt and veggies crispy( less cooked) and every time Chanpen Thai Cusine would come thru perfectly. Vegetables were always in abundance portions were ample and the taste was delicious. One time and only one time we got our food and it was different we all noticed rite away. Frist the portion was very small and veggies were not in abundance. We asked the waiter and he told us that they had hired a new cook. We politely made a few comments about how; the food is not the same. Expressing that we were hoping that this was not how it was going to be.  Four days later we were there for dinner and, Chanpen came out of the kitchen and apologized for the the prior meal at our last visit......and she went on to explain that she had hired a cook to help her, and that the new cook was not making the food up to her standards after giving them  a week or so on the job. She ended up just doing all the cooking by her self. She said that they kept sending plates out with small portions and that she kept having to remake them or stop them before they left the kitchen. Chanpen checks every thing before it leaves her kitchen. She's not leaving it up to hired help.  Chanpen is the best.  Delicious food Ample portions And an owner that cares about her customers and wants to make them happy.",

It is a small family owned place so I suggest ordering take out since there aren't many places to sit. Very good Thai food and I will be back again.

Parking is fairly limited and there's only about 6 or 7 tables inside. I ordered the Pad Thai and my dad had the beef Chow Mein, both of which were excellent. My dad enjoyed the Chow Mein. The Pad Thai that I had (at a heat level of 3 out 5) was perfectly seasoned, with a fairly generous portion of food overall, although it wasn't nearly as much shrimp as I thought there would be. They have a great variety of hot chilies on the table if you'd like to up the heat mid meal. At the end we were offered what I thought was pistachio ice cream, which was great as well.",

This is a very TINY place that isn't fancy and only has a few tables but also serves very above average Thai Food.  We tried the Chicken Pot Stickers. They were packed full of tasty seasoned moist Chicken and were fried crispy in clean tasting oil.  My husband had the Sweet Basil Duck and ordered it at a 4 level heat out of 5. The Moist Rich Duck was Roasted and then added into the flavorful Fiery Sauce and with Crunchy Colorful Vegetables. This dish was excellent and was a bargain at the (I think) $10.99 Price.  I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken also at a heat level of 4 out of 5. I received a very Velvety Well Balanced Aromatic Sauce also with crunchy fresh vegetables but with not bad but slightly dry chicken. It didn't come out as spicy as I wanted it because it was close to being mild but I thought it was still delicious and I would still order it again.   They surprised us with complimentary ice cream.   The Owner/Chef Personally Thanked Every Single Person for Coming In.  A really Good Place for Thai Food.... Shame it's not an area I normally can go to or I'd go more often.  A True 4.5",

The Drunken Noodles were the only spicy dish I ordered and it had great flavor and texture. The Pad Thai also tasted great and the noodles were cooked wonderfully. The Yellow Curry had a great consistency and flavor, something that I would liken to making a great coconut curry without using too much coconut milk.  The Thai Tea was excellent and given the price was a good serving size (unlike other places I have been to where I literally have paid $3.00 for a cup of ice).  Would definitely come back for Thai food, only issue is it's so far away from where I live haha.",

The staff was so friendly and the cooks were efficient. While we waited for our carry out order, they offered us bottled water and ice cream. When we finally dug into our food, the flavors were delicious.  We ordered the lemongrass soup, papaya salad, and house pad Thai noodles. The soup was very flavorful and one of the best I have had so far. The papaya salad was a bit bland but with some doctoring with the included chili vinegar, we ate it up... that being said, I wouldn't order it again.  The pad Thai noodles were tasty and included both chicken and shrimp... good go-to order for sure.",

The food tasted great - I got a pad Thai, my parents got a vegetable dish with duck and a cashew dish with all the different meats. We decided to get something to go for my husband, we got him masaman beef curry, since the food was good. We saw flies flying around when we were about to leave, we just shrugged it off (bad idea)!!!  Fast forward to that night was probably the worst night in my house. My husband and my mom was vomiting all night long, while me and my dad just had to use the bathroom a lot. My mom also had a fever the following day. We can't even talk about eating any thai food to this day. Never again!",

Service  was Wonderful even gave my children and I am complimentary coconut ice-cream.  All food was delish, the chicken tasted freshly cooked not pre boiled like other places I've tried.

Finally, as you look around, you see the Asian network on TV, the sweet servers behind the front desk, and think to yourself, \"This might be some authentic Thai food?\" Well, to answer your question. You betcha bottom dolla it is!  I believe most of the local crowd has it right. They get TO GO. They order ahead, and the food is piping hot ready to take home. The servers or owners know most of the take out crew. They converse, make them feel welcomed, and deliver such delicious Thai food.  The highlight is correct. Get the Coconut Soup. It's fresh, sweet, and definitely savory. The food itself comes out straight from the pan. It is smoking hot. After some tumultuous experiences with the number of heat in Thai food. The wife and I went with only a 2. We will definitely up the ante next time. Although the flavor is amazing. This is quality food.  What a humbling experience in this hole in the wall limited seating Thai restaurant. However, welcome to Reno. The biggest little Thai Restaurant in AZ!",

There are only 5 tables in the entire restaurant so it is SMALL.  The bathroom is strange and dingy but the food and the service makes up for it.  Maybe I should back up.  We ordered the egg rolls and the spring rolls.  They were not good.  The veggie spring rolls were actually not good at all.  Was like a cheap wilting bag of lettuce/carrot mix from the grocery store rolled up.  I only ate half of one.  Then came out the food.  My girls were sharing a tofu pad thai.  It smelled DISGUSTING.  I think maybe I am just not a fan of pad thai?  My husband got the chicken sweet basil heat #5 and was in heaven.  My son got the red pineapple curry with beef heat #3 and very much enjoyed it.  I had the eggplant with tofu heat #1 and it was seriously AMAZING.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  Then for dessert we were brought out complimentary green tea iced cream and fried bananas.  They are so good!  I could never eat here again and not order them.  I keep thinking about them 2 days later!!",

The place is a bit small and a little tight which can get really crowded too. But the food was delicious. They definitely were not stingy on the seasoning. The tom ka kai soup(coconut soup) only had mushroom as a vegetable and maybe a little thicker base but had flavor. The regular chicken fried rice also did not come with any veggies, just eggs and a choice of meat but it was still good. Our favorite was the drunken noodles it was delicious, you can taste different flavors and basil but where it's not too strong. Definitely recommend this place, and hopefully come back soon.",

Big portions for a great price.  Beware the levels of spiciness - it goes 0 to 5 and 3 was almost too spicy for most of us. 4 and 5 are probably best saved for folks who have grown up with True levels of Thai spiciness.  Service was really good. I'm the type of person who gets fussy when my water glass isn't refilled almost constantly and here the refills were constant and unobtrusive.",

    "text": "First of all, I really really loved this place!! It is extremely small, with like six or seven tables, but had great service.  They were helpful and polite. First we ordered the fresh rolls as an appetizer, and it was so good!! The fresh lettuce and mint with the sweet peanut sauce was to die for.  I also ordered the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and absolutely enjoyed it. The sauce had really good flavor. I ordered it mild, and it came exactly that way. When we were finished they brought us complimentary green tea ice cream. I generally don't like the taste of green tea, but it was delicious.",

    "text": "Some of the best Thai food we've had in the states. It's comparable to the food we had in Thailand. It's authentic, delicious, the portions are generous, and it won't break the bank. We had the coconut soup w/chicken, green curry with veggies, and chick panang curry, all level 3 heat. We could have gone higher, but 3 gives some good heat without distracting from the flavor.  Lots of veggies and lots of leftovers. It's a charming little place and I'd highly recommend it to anyone",

    "text": "After reading the reviews on Yelp we decided to give this restaurant a try and were very excited. However, we were let down. Certain dishes were excellent while others were sub par. On the other hand, the customer service was extremely disappointing. We requested to have sort of an appetizer sampler because we wanted to try several appetizers but the answer was no even though the ring up process is extremely manual... Ok fine. Then we ordered the chicken/shrimp pat Thai dish and it came with one shrimp. When I asked if that was a mistake I was told no. Then when I requested more they said there would be a charge.... $1 per shrimp! And then they told me that it costs them $20/lbs (why are you telling your customers this? Very unprofessional). If you look through the pictures on yelp that dish OBVIOUSLY comes with more shrimp. So that was misleading. The fried toast was just that... And I wasn't impressed. The crab puffs were the best part about this place, so if you must try it, then try those. Also, both of our drinks were down to ice with no offer of a refill. In fact, our server never returned to check up on us once the food was delivered. I feel this place is more concerned about the money than pleasing customers. I was looking forward to taking my husband but will not be returning.",

What a foolish mistake that was... the food is here is A+. I have always been a big fan of Yuphas in Tempe but Chanpen has finally brought competition. I am excited to have a great Thai food place close to work. The staff was very friendly and I felt right at home. I will definitely be back.  Thanks Chanpen",

The food is really good and fresh.  They always start with some delicious soup--spicy and tasty.  My daughters eat the noodles and I love their sweet and sour pork which are outrageously good.  This is an inexpensive, casual place but you won't be disappointed.  Our meal at lunch for 3 costs around $22.",
