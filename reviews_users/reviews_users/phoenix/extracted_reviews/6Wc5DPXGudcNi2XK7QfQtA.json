The lunch portion was perfectly presented, portioned and prepared. Jennifer did and outstanding job of serving and I was very happy I found you for lunch.   Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "A couple friends and I went here after searching for a dinner place around 9pm on a weeknight. Much of downtown Phoenix closes up shop early during weekdays so it was good to find a place that was open with some life to it.  We were quickly seated and ordered some margaritas. They brought out chips and salsa that were actually very tasty. The chips are brushed with some sort of chipotle spice and served with chipotle salsa as well.  For my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas which were decent, but nothing to write home about. All of the portions were pretty large, but I still felt that the prices were a bit high considering the quality of food.  The service was friendly and relatively speedy and they even gave us a little palette cleansing dessert to complete the meal.  Overall, this place is a good place to get your fix for margaritas and Mexican food in Phoenix, but just be prepared to pay a little higher price than you are probably used to.",

We ordered margaritas which were delicious. They bring the entire mixer, so you get about 1.5 - 2 glasses once you're finished drinking it.  We had the fish tacos and Avodo chicken pasta. Both tasted good and were cooked just right. Portions were fairly sizable.   Dining space is fairly large and is good for groups.",

We all had soup and salads. It was a good lunch with  nice variety of flavors.  The chicken pablano chowder was really nice.  End of the meal comes with a little treat of white chocolate pecan in a tamale husk.  Yelp check in gets you a free dessert with entree. I didn't think the soup and salad would classify but our waitress was awesome and said she surely could do one dessert for our table of three.   Great place for lunch. Plenty of seating.

    "text": "I have nothing bad but nothing spectacular to say about Canyon Cafe.   My meal started with chips and salsa, but not normal chips Tortola chips, sopapilla chips and tiny sweet potato chips... all covered with Chile spice. Seemed like a good idea but the portions aren't right and the chili space conflicts with the salsa (which was good) but did not create a synergy.  I had two tacos and made it a meal with beans and rice. The Bison taco was slightly over spiced and being that the ground bison was very light in texture it took in too much other characters and was hard to differentiate from other beef. my chili Relleno  taco had mushrooms and an overabundance of tomato paste making it almost like lasagna.  Overall I have to say it's like they are trying too hard and creating these fusion recipes that miss the mark. Although things were palatable, the concepts employed were okay, and the service was good I have to give it a 3. I did see many good dishes I wish I had tried instead so I'm not completely averse to trying those items, but the tacos were certainly lackluster.",

The combination was an upgrade from the bland chips and tomato juice most Mexican restaurants serve. I followed that up with some chicken enchiladas covered in hatch chile sauce, which came with a side salad and corn salsa in an edible tortilla cup. I noted the great attention to detail and beautiful presentation.  Topped everything off with a white chocolate tamale \"on the chef\" which was just sweet enough to satisfy that dessert craving. Will stop in again next time I'm in the area!",

    "text": "We chose Canyon Cafe for our dinner after walking through the Arizona Center and it looked appealing. We asked to sit outside since it was a beautiful, balmy December evening.  We told our server, Ryan that we needed to be in and out in an hour and he assured us he'd make that happen since the kitchen wasn't terribly busy. Waters all around and then drinks were ordered. A had a beer so there's not much to report there. M choice a Mai-Tai and it was VERY strong. We all choked back a swig to verify and then asked Ryan to add something to tone it down, which he did rather quickly. K & I were intrigued by the \"Limit 2\" Margaritas so we each ordered the Top Shelf ConMemorativo which I have to say was just average. Pricey ($11.95) for average.  Dinner selections included the carnitas platter, a spinach/portabella quesadilla, and some kind of stew with jalapenos and all kinds of tasty things...beef? pork? Can you tell this wasn't my dish? I did however, get to taste it and all of us had wished we'd ordered it. It was that good. The report on the quesadilla was that it was good and just enough food. The carnitas were a little dry but the plate arranged beautifully. Canyon serves an odd chips & salsa combo too - puffy fried flour tortillas (my guess on the flour) and then sprinkled with a sweet, BBQ flavoring. Interesting. They were good but we could only eat a couple each.  The best part about Canyon for us was Ryan! He was super friendly, super attentive without annoying us and accommodated all our requests...even one for a picture!",

We were seated quickly and served drinks and our food in a timely manner. Prior to ordering I checked out other Yelp reviews just as you are now and the things that stood out to me we're the chips and salsa and the margaritas. Well, everyone said it and I'm gonna say it too! You must try the chips and salsa (my favorite chip is the wonton chip, a little sweet heat! Yum!) and of course to go with it get the top shelf conmemorativo margarita...so, so, so good! I also got the spinach and portobello mushroom quesadilla and it was good.   It was so Delish that I brought a different large group of friends back to this place. Unfortunately, the restaurant was much busier and I'm not sure they handled the large crowds very well. We were told 1 hour wait, but after 20 minutes our buzzer went off. When we gathered our group to be seated the hostess told us it was a mistake and asked us to wait off to the side in the dining area. This wait was another hour before we approached the hostess. She was very rude and told us it would be 'awhile' but wouldn't give us a time frame. When we asked if it would be 10? 30? 1 and a half hours? She said it would be at least that! Unacceptable when we were told an hour wait. I asked to speak to a manager and Tony was extremely responsive! He worked it so that we were seated right away! The server  was fantastic as she stepped in to take our large party and we were seated outside her section. The chips and salsa came out quickly and she was great with getting us drinks (of course I had another round of the margarita) and the food was great. This time around I had the salmon. So delish! And the desserts were covered by the server as an apology for our wait.   The manager Tony was great, responsive and helped me to overcome my disappointment in the rude hostess encounter and he brought me back to a 4 star rating for the great service and food once we were seated. I would definitely recommend this place and the margarita!",

Everything except the salad had far more salt than necessary or even reasonable.  Music was too loud for the few other diners and was some terrible mix that had nothing to do with the Tex/Mex theme that was so carefully planned everywhere throughout the entire restaurant.  And final problem was probably just bad luck, but the chili rubbed sirloin, while fantastically yummy to taste, was the most gristly piece of meat I've ever been served anywhere (including the IHOP).  Also managed to deliver an almost well-done dish when I had asked for medium-rare.  Would have given 3-4 stars if more appropriate music and volume, less salt, and properly prepared steak.",

From were we were sitting we saw the manager her name Caitlin Brooks she was looking at us and talking to a co-worker we saw when they took the cups of juice she did not come to our table to apologize about what they had given us . Needless to say I wanted to get up and leave what stopped me was that I am not that kind of person to just get up and leave after i had already order my food . The whole experience at this restaurant was bad I will never go back I would have thought that the manager would come and said something but it looked like they just wanted us to leave as the waiter brought the check before we were even done that really made me feel like we were not wanted I think that no one should feel like that at a place were they wanted to go and relax and have a good time with there family ... But all in all I will never ever go back to his place.",

Not sure if the solar flares, the full moon, or the fact that it's Friday the 13th had anything to do with it,  but the fact that it was my first time there, the roaches made it my last time there! And the fact that the booth seating with the huge square pillars makes for an uncomfortable setting. And the energy is not good,  very off! Also, the roaches were small, meaning there are more, probably a nest! Roaches don't come out during the day unless there's an infestation! Wouldn't recommend eating here!",

The Guac itself was decent, the presentation of it was really good.  I was a big fan of this place and would go back in a hurry.  One thing to be aware of is the fact that the advertisements for drink specials on the sidewalk are a little misleading, as they are only valid in the really small bar area.  Next time, I will be sure to grab my drink first in the bar area for the discounted price before I sit down.  Enjoy!",

There were mostly business types and tourists dining around us.  We chatted over drinks while taking in the water fountains @ the AZ Center and soaking up comfortably warm sun rays.  While waiting for our food, we grazed on chips that resembled a mix of real tortilla chips and some potato puffs that reminded me of Munchos.  Except the things that looked & crunched like Munchos had a slightly sweet taste.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos.  My plate came with the double shelled tacos with a zesty sauce and a choice of toppings for you to spoon yourself--black beans, spicy coleslaw mix & Spanish rice.  AT the end of the meal, they brought out white chocolate that had been chilled & wrapped in a corn husk.  It was just enough to satisfy a dessert craving without making you feel like crap, if you'd decided to order dessert after a deliciously filling meal.  The only drawback is that the prices are a lil high--$10.95 for my Orange Beso margarita, which was poured @ the table.  (The server left the remainder in the shaker for me to imbibe).  And my taco plate was around $10 too.",

The service was spot on, and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared (their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker), our entrees did not disappoint. Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon - I'd definitely come back if this were in my city!!",

Once you have one - you will understand its name!   Service is excellent - never an empty water or ice tea glass! The tea is fresh brewed. We ordered all over the menu - several favorites - Fish Tacos and Crispy Shrimp Tacos were outstanding. Both cooked perfectly - the slaw is off the charts.   The pork dishes are incredible. Location is a little challenging to find - in the middle of a small corner shopping plaza - across the street from the Sheraton. Two blocks from the Convention Center.   Salsa is so fresh the tomatoes are still ripening in the bowl! Nice smoky flavor to salsa - also the chips are seasoned - really different and delish!",

    "text": "We stumbled upon Canyon Cafe because it was extremely convenient- located across from my hotel in the Arizona Center.  Because of that, and the fact that they have a wonderful large outdoor patio (perfect in March), we wound up here two nights in a row, even though we found the food, drinks, and service mediocre.  Group decision, not a personal preference to return.  First thing, both nights, the service was Extremely Slow.  It's annoying when multiple servers/bussers walk by without even a 'someone will be right with you'.  On our second visit, the hostess actually stopped to ask us if anyone had been over after 15 minutes sitting at our table without any wait staff talking to us.  We must have looked irked.  Secondly, they limit you to 2 margaritas, so they should be fantastic, but we all found them to be incredibly inconsistent in taste and alcohol strength.  Out of the 4 margaritas I personally had over two nights; 1 was Fantastic, one was overly strong, 1 tasted like a virgin, and 1 was just okay.  As for the actual food, the chips they serve with the chips and salsa were an interesting and cool mix of yellow and blue corn tortilla, sweet potato (my fav), wonton (second fav), and flour tortillas with a dry seasoning (next fav).  The salsa was meh, but the untraditional chips didn't even need it.  This was the best part of the meal.  I had the chicken fajitas night 1.  The chicken was really dry and had an abundance of unnecessary seasoning on it.  The accouterments were just standard.  I ordered the steak/shrimp fajitas night 2.  The steak was very good but the shrimp was tasteless.  All in all, I cannot see why I would ever return to this restaurant.",

Unfortunately the place didn't live up to expectations but complimentary food you get with every visit softens the blow.   I ordered the enchiladas and carnitas platter with a cup of the chicken chowder as an appetizer. The soup was pretty average, thick and creamy with big pieces of chicken and even bigger pieces of carrots. Not bad but not really worth ordering again. The platter on the other hand was a disaster. The enchiladas were nothing more than poorly rolled taquitos completely lacking in enchilada sauce sitting on a bed of rice covered in some watered down cheese sauce. Meh! The carnitas were even worse: dry, tough and flavorless, I took two bites and couldn't finish the rest. I really don't know how this plate left the kitchen.  There are some upsides however. The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. They brought over two big bowls of chips (assortment of sweet potatoes, corn, and plantains) and some home made salsa. Canyon Cafe also brings over some white chocolate/nut desert wrapped in corn husks. A welcome distraction before you see how much $$ they are charging you. Lastly, don't forget the Yelp! check in for a free dessert. We got the cheesecake and it was a massive strawberry coated piece of deliciousness, probably the best part of the dinner. Service friendly and on point.  Overall an ok experience. Worth a second chance.",

It still took an hour and 15min and all I ordered was a salad.  Don't get the Calamari Salad if it is on special.  I should have known better than to get that at a TexMex restaurant, but lesson learned.  The dressing was very good, but the calamari was over-fried and the cucumbers were mushy and disgusting.    Long story short, for lunch I had lettuce with good dressing and amazing chips and salsa for $15.  I saw plates of tacos go by that looked and smelled much better than what I was mulling through.  The waitress felt bad though, she could tell I was not enjoying my meal.  As a consolation prize I was hooked up with a delicious white chocolate tamale when I got my bill.  I will be back, I will choose more wisely, and hopefully things will be better!",

    "text": "Enjoyed a Sunday afternoon Happy Hour here this weekend before catching a flight back to the Bay Area. I was with two friends who live nearby and enjoyed their company as much as I enjoyed the pretty view from the outdoor patio of Canyon Cafe.   I was in Arizona for the Ragnar Relay so most of the places I saw were on foot or looking out the window of a minvan. This was really the only afternoon of my vacation that I had to rest and relax and see the town.   Service was terrific. Saul (I think that's what he said) was very attentive and brought us some delicious chips to start and even a wonderful white chocolate tomale dessert at the end. We had $4 margaritas and one iced tea as we sat by the unlit firepit. Everything was perfect! I would definitely return here next time I visit friends or run another out-of-state race.",

    "text": "Let's say you're in Phoenix for a conference. You want to unwind at the end of the day with your colleagues, have a leisurely discussion of what you've been conferencing about, and enjoy regional cuisine without wallet-breaking prices or concerns that \"authentic\" might verge into \"scary.\" GO HERE.  1. It is within walking distance of your hotel, with a lovely view of a garden.  2. The chips are amazing. Think \"professional chef reimagines Doritos\" for portions of them, but there are also normal tortilla chips and blue corn tortilla chips.  3. The drinks are exceedingly drink-like, with none of that pesky margarita-mix taste. Order something with prickly pear juice in it.  4. In sporadic meals during my years in Arizona, I've never had service that was other than charming. It's possible YMMV if you hit a huge rush, but if they're not jammed, you should feel very happy and pampered.  5. The white-chocolate tamale at the end of the meal is perfect if you want a little something sweet but weren't up for dessert.  Order lots of plates to share among your group because... the food ranges from amazing to meh, and I'd swear sometimes the same dish has been both amazing and meh on different trips. (I'm certain I had the Pablo's enchiladas with a totally exciting salad and very subtle flavors on a past trip, when it was more \"well, that's an enchilada, can't argue with that\" the most recent time.) The good news is that I've never had a dish be worse than meh, and even the meh-est experience was pretty good for the first two or three bites... so if you have a bunch of dishes and are taking a couple bites of each, the odds are strongly in your favor that you'll generally be very happy.  If that method doesn't work for you, I've had good experience with the carnitas so far. There was also a very pleasant Easter brunch. You're paying about normal street prices, maybe a couple bucks above Macayo's, for enchilada-type meals (and the quality is way better, even on meh days) and $17-$20 for serious entrees.  In any case, you're really here to converse and drink and nibble chips as evening falls across the artificial pond, which experience they do exceedingly well here.  ETA: if you visit on a really cold, sunless day, bundle up! Like many Arizona establishments, this place expects sun through the windows to contribute to a pleasing indoor winter temperature.",

I had been in once before for a quick happy hour with co-workers, and that was fine - they have a pretty good margarita happy hour deal.  This is the first time I had gone in for a meal. It was a Monday at noon, and the place was slammed. This isn't atypical for AZ Center restaurants when there is a conference in town. However, they had a table for 8 ready to go quickly, which was pleasantly surprising. Despite being slammed and dealing with a table of 8 going Dutch, the service was swift, accurate, and pleasant.   I had a combo fajita platter - steak and grilled veggies. It was $17, but felt like $30 worth of food. I can eat a lot. I had three enormous fajitas - each stuffed to the gills with steak, veggies, rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, and tomato. I only ate about half or maybe two-thirds of this platter. It was impressive. It was also pretty tasty for this kind of more-casual Mexican eatery. Not mind blowing, but will do for large groups of co-workers or clients. As Yelp says, it's A-OK.  Even with 8 folks on separate checks, we were all seated, fed, and out of there in 45 minutes. I was delighted and impressed. Canyon Cafe will be on my list of potential client spots/business meals from now on.",

Came with a large group for a convention (15 of us). -slow service and the restaurant was not packed it was a tue night 730 pm. Maybe they understaff during the week? We still tipped our gal nicely... -table side guac saved it for me fresh, not too much heat or salt  Apps: (Calamari too much breading and way too salty. Chicken quesadilla tons of make your tummy hurt cheese)  -had the steak fajitas... Beef was not good quality. Under seasons and veggies over cooked. My rice/beans looked dry and sad like they were waiting under a heat lamp for 30 min.  -my colleague had the shrimp fajitas looked like old defrosted baby shrimp.. Just a sad lookin plate (not worth any pix)  Id come back for drinks and apps but not dinner. The patio at night is pretty",

The pasta was good and delicious, I just wish I couldn't have taken it home with me and the chocolate pie was to die for. Delicious heaven in your mouth, it was so creamy and good. I shared it with everyone at my table and they fell in love. And for only having one margarita it packed a nice punch and got me pretty tipsy.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and people around. The server was very kind and explained anything we asked of her.  The only downside was the floor was sticky. From the moment I walked in the door and started walking back to the table, I could feel this unusually stickiness under my feet.  Not a big deal once you hit your seat or once you walk out the door.  As long as you're not walking around the place all night then it shouldn't bother you much.  I'm also sure that the sticky floor was a onetime fluke and will probably never happen again should I ever return.  In the end I'd recommend it, it was good food and good service at reasonable prices.",

At the end of the meal they give you a corn husk filled with white chocolate(not a tamale, like everyone keeps saying) which was very quite delightful. Also the setting was so beautiful.  I have never been to a place that gorgeous before and to top it off my parents hate sitting outside but this place they rather of sat outside then inside! lol.  P.S.

I'm not sure but I think the taxi driver took the long way there, 20 bucks from the airport seemed a bit much considering how close it was.  But as for Sam's cafe, we really enjoyed it. The chips and salsa was a good start, I like how the basket was an assortment of chips. They prepared the guacamole fresh in front of you too which was pretty cool. We both enjoyed the food. I had this skillet lasagna dish and my girl had a carnitas and something combo plate. The carnitas were a little dry for my liking though. They were a few items on the menu that looked really good too so if I'm ever in the area again I'll hopefully try them.  Oh, we took light rail back to the airport for $1.75 each and took us less time to get there. Just in case you're traveling like us.",

When she seated us she did not tell us when our server would be around and she didn't check the cleanliness of the table. There was fresh bird poop in multiple places on our outside table. We moved OURSELVES  inside and the hostess never came to check what the problem was or why we moved.The restaurant was pretty much empty so she should've been able to do that.  All but two plates at our table were dirty. We waited about 15 minutes before we actually saw our server. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. We waited another 10 minutes for those. We waited 20-30 minutes for our food and when we needed any kind of wait staff there was no one around. On top of that they don't validate parking and if they do they didn't offer that. When we finally got our food our meters for our car had ran out and we had to go out to refill them. The food tasted good but I've had better and for the amount of food you get I think this place is overpriced. I definitely will think twice before dining here again.",

Jon had the corn crusted calamari. I don't have a calamari palate so I can't rank it against anything, but he said it was just average. The drinks however were BOMB (margarita with cranberry, lime, and prickly pear juice), both frozen and iced. Our server was super sweet and chatted it up with us which was nice.

    "text": "Dave and I were exploring to new places around our new home and came across this lovely cafe in the middle of the Arizona Center. We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.    We started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking.  For dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing.   Over all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help. I would and will definite visit this place again, especially since it is only 0.2 miles away.",

Sitting outside on the patio under the gorgeous sparkling lights on the palm trees, with the sound of the running water in the fountains nearby, in the heart of Central Phoenix.  It didn't even matter at that point if the food was good!     I've been back several times since and this place doesn't disappoint.  However, I would rank ambiance #1, alcohol #2 and food #3.  Drink choices are widely ranging so everyone will find something.   From your traditional margarita to a cocktail, the drinks are strong and well made.  As for the food, I've had a few dishes I liked - the black and bleu quesadilla and the fajitas tend to be my go-to.  I love the salsa too - it's a chipotle, smoky flavor - my favorite kind!   Best little treat is a white chocolate dessert served in a corn husk at the end of the meal.   Great little inclusion!     This is located in the Arizona Center by the AMC movie theater, so makes it easy for a great dinner and movie night.   Then grab your date's arm and take a stroll through the courtyard, enjoy the twinkling lights and fountains.   There's no way you'll be able to resist the romance!  =)",

Not to mention the chocolate chip and pecan complimentary tamale was totally different than the traditional tamales we're accustomed to yet scrumptious! I would have gave this restaurant, formerly Sam's cafe, 5 stars but the guacamole was too lemony and our service was pretty slow at the beginning despite seeing tons of staff pass us on by, but once the manager took notice everything changed!

Compared to any Tex-Mex restaurant in Texas, however, this was pretty bleh. So, for travelers that know good Mexican or Tex-Mex food, you may be disappointed with the flavors here--but given your few eating options in Phoenix, I'd definitely recommend it.  Primary food gripes: the salsa was smoky tasting and so dark as to almost look black. The carnitas in my chimichanga were dry and burnt. Little spice or flavor to the overall dish.  Positives: Their top shelf margarita was excellent. Just excellent. Also, one of my fellow diners loved the stuffed chicken dish.   Service-related: Attentive, friendly service, if a little overly so. Weak or no A/C on in the restaurant while we ate. In June. Not awesome.",

    "text": "How good is Sam's? Well, I just got back from eating dinner here, and I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more than write this review -- that's how good it is.   I'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did!   Let me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.  Once we were seated, we were tempted to order the \"Limit-2\" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.  Let me stop right here.  I knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!  Once we overcame the confusion of what the \"Super Salad\" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.  For the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the \"Sam-Mex\" section of the menu. According to the menu, \"Sam-Mex\" was created by their executive chef with \"the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures.\" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.  Words cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.  I'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!   At the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as \"white chocolate tamales,\" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal.   While I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little \"cafe\" called, Sam's.",

The complimentary chips and salsa were addictive.  The variety of chips was incredible, sweet potato, multicolored corn chips, and some other unidentifiable but delicious vegetable based chips.  Amazing.  I had a stuffed chicken dish and my date had the carnitas plate.  I tried them both and they were really delicious, but the carnitas was definitely the better of the two.  It was moist and tender, but with delicious crispy caramelized edges.   I didn't hear a single complaint about the food and drink from anyone at the table!  The only complaints I could possibly voice are about the atmosphere.  It was very crowded on a Friday after work and so it was pretty loud.  The sun beating through the floor to ceiling window was a little much, I was blinded for the first third of our meal and it was a little warm.  Once the sun went down, it was pretty great though.  I would go back!",

You live downtown in one of those overpriced lofts, within walking distance from the Arizona Center.   Here's my recommendation.  Walk to Sam's. It's a few more steps than the mailbox, but at least you won't find any unwanted surprises.  Carb loading? You bet.  Order the Desert Fire Pasta, Pancho's Carnitas, or the Chicken Quesadilla.

Although I live in California now, I still come to AZ for my dentist (see my other review below) and every time that I am in town I make sure to stop by this restaurant. Their service is impeccable and the food is even better. They have the best chips and salsa EVER. They throw about 5 different types of chips into their mix (e.g., blue corn, sweet potato chips, tortilla chips, fried tortilla chips), and they are out of this world. The blackened fish tacos (I order soft shell) are my favorite entree on the menu, but I also love the blackened chicken ceasar salad. Pretty much everything on the menu that I have tried has been delicious. In addition, the atmosphere is awesome. It has a very relaxed vibe on the inside and the outside patio has a great view of the beautiful landscape (water fountains, palm trees, plants) at the Arizona Center. This is my happy place, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! :)",

I had the Naked Chile Relleno which was amazing and different from the typical breaded one.  The mango margaritas were amazing as well.  What really amazed me is the staff service all around.  The bartender was attentive. I inadvertently left my iPhone by the bar and didn't realize it was missing until an hour after I left the cafe.  I called the cafe and sure enough they found an iPhone which I went back for it and once there the manager verified that I was the rightful owner and got my iPhone back.  Today I needed a copy of my receipt for my business expenses, which I forgot to take with me, and I called for it. The staff person who answered and general manager located the receipt and e-mailed me a copy of it.  Again, I cannot be any more happier with the customer service all around.  Pleasant experience!",

I'm from California so maybe I'm a little spoiled when it comes to good Mexican, but regardless this place fell way short.  oh!  and I asked for no onions and the plate was covered in them!  poor form.",

Obviously with time there are tweaks to the menu and such and let me just tell you this place is even better than it was before. I had the Grand Canyon margarita, made with prickly pear cactus juice and it was amazing. I had the combo enchilada plate and it too was to die for. Both styles of enchiladas were amazing and the rice and beans were sumptuous and I just wish I could've eaten it all! I WILL be back! The central Phoenix location in the Arizona Center is absolutely beautiful and you just must eat here!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner with a big group of people, probably over 30 people, and I have to say I was very impressed with the hospitality and great service from this restaurant.   First off, my group made reservations at the wrong restaurant and we were staying at the Hyatt about 5 min away and we had no idea where a group as large as us could eat last minute. However, our concierge directed us to Canyon Cafe and upon calling, they were very willing to accommodate for our party. Luckily, it was a weekday evening and there were not too many people there. When we arrived we were welcomed by a very beautiful patio area with palm trees, string lights, and a pond, perfect for a group picture. The restaurant was charming too with a Tex-Mex influence. I also must compliment on their hospitality when one of our group members changed from eating outside to inside last minute and the restaurant had to accommodate very quickly.   I tried their Orange Besos alcoholic beverage and it was delicious. The price seemed like a lot at first but you get enough for two servings so you can easily share with a friend, or be selfish like me and down it all. They serve salsa and chips as you are waiting, but that was honestly the best chips and salsa I've ever had. The chips had really great seasoning and the salsa was the perfect spice. I also ordered chicken quesadilla for my meal, and I strongly encourage you to share unless you're a fatty like me! It was really good too, they have chipotle sauce on it that tasted great, along with guacamole on the side. I enjoyed it for breakfast the next morning as well.  I have no complaints against the restaurant considering we threw a lot on them last minute. Getting our checks took a while, but what can you do when you have a group this large. All in all, I enjoyed this restaurant and give huge props for their service.",

Also one of the helpful people in the Orange outfits had recommended it.    I went there twice for Happy Hour and also I had lunch there.  Their Happy Hour prices are 1/2 the price of the drinks at the Sheraton.    For lunch I had their chips and salsa.  The chips are homemade and have a very unique delicious taste to them.  Their salsa is also good, but just a little too spicy for me at lunch.  I also couldn't decide which soup I wanted.  So the waitress was kind enough to bring me out both soups:  Tortilla Soup and the Poblano Chicken Chowder.  I liked them both, so I ordered them both.  Actually the Tortilla Soup was a little bit spicy.  They were both good though.  I also ordered the Southwest Caesar Salad.  It was good and fresh.    The waitress also brought me out a piece of white chocolate wrapped in a corn husk. (I think that's what it was wrapped in)  It was very good.    The service can be a little bit slow.  Especially at the bar area.  Take that into consideration if you're on a time crunch.",

Sadly, Canyon Cafe just doesn't cut it. I ordered the carnitas plate which came with meat, fajita veggies, rice, beans and tortillas. The meat was tender but bland, the fajita veggies were not cooked thoroughly (I expect fajitas veggies to be crispy and fresh off the grill), the rice was mediocre. The beans and tortillas were the best part of the plate. My coworker got the ahi tuna southwestern salad and he rated it 4/5 stars.  The best part of my meal was the white chocolate nut dessert that comes with your check. It's wrapped up in a corn husk and looks as good as it tastes!  One highlight: free dessert if you check in on Yelp! I got the chocolate cake to go. It was super rich and basically a huge block of fudge. The crust was tasty but I hardly ate any of the cake itself.  4 stars for service and convenience, 2 stars for food, 2 stars for dessert (even though it was free). I probably won't be back.",

They offer a really nice patio, complimentary assortment of interesting chips and salsa and complimentary white chocolate pecan tamales with the check.  I had the Blacken Salmon Caesar. The salmon was ok on a bed of warm wilted greens and garnished with unripe tomatoes. The dressing lacked flavors of anchovy, Worcestershire and black pepper maybe they were busy and the kitchen ran out of those things....? The dressing tasted like mayonnaise thinned down with lots of water and lemon juice.   My husband had the Chile Relleno stuffed with fajita steak. I tasted a small piece of steak and it was tender and flavorful. I didn't try the ranchero sauce but my husband said it tasted just like the salsa and over powered the fajita steak. (the salsa was very strong with lime)  My husband insisted that I try the Paella Rice. It tasted like boxed seasoned rice infused with enough smoke to season all of Arizona and maybe a neighboring state. I'd say someone slipped with the smoke flavoring.  On the way out we saw table tents on the specials that nobody told us about.  The positives were the atmosphere of the patio, The interesting and massive assortment of chips (some vegetable chips, tortillas that were savory, sweet, plain and different textures and colors) the complimentary white chocolate, pecan tamale.",

We had a a decent sized group, around 10, and all of us were pleased with our meals!  I wish there had been a few more vegetarian options but was pleased with my selection of SPINACH & PORTABELLA MUSHROOM QUESADILLA. It had a perfect smoky taste. Not too cheesy or vegetably. A perfect balance in my opinion.  I would say the winners of our trips there were:  #1 The chips and salsa. The free chip basket seemed never ending and there were three different kinds of homemade  tortilla chips in each basket. The salsa had a nice chipotle kick and I filled up more than I intended to with the chips and salsa!  #2 Their infamous, \"limit 2\" margaritas. While I didn't have them myself, several people in my group did. They said they were strong and delicious and definitely did the job of getting the fiesta started!  If I'm ever in the downtown Phoenix area again, I'd stop by Canyon Cafe next time when they are having their Queso Bar. Sounds delicious.",

Be careful of the chips & salsa appetizer- they're bound to get you hooked before the actual meal comes out! I got the salmon flautas which had a fruit salsa topping.  It was greasy and not too flavorful, but the salsa balanced out the greasiness.  My friend had the bbq burger and the black fish tacos, and they enjoyed their dishes as well.  It's not outstanding, but a nice place to eat at with a nice view.  They also gave a peppermint white chocolate tamale dessert for free at the end of my meal! Only thing I didn't like were the birds outside sitting on the tables and pecking at crumbs on the floor!",

Drinks were wrong after ordering- they were however corrected.  Food orders were messed up, arrived nearly 45 minutes later, all were cold, some were not even cooked all the way through.  We even had to return the chicken salad twice as it was made wrong, nothing special about it just didn't want dressing.  No one ever came to check on us, no one apologized, nothing was comp'ed.  The young ladies at the hostess stand were not very helpful either to our waitress who was clearly trying her best but over her head.  Not a good experience - go somewhere else.",

Really? That first round was really weak, by the way. After bringing this to the waiter's attention, he \"checked\" with his manager and gave us the happy hour price. Needless to say, we didn't order any more drinks from him and he made himself scarce. Would have ordered food, if he came back and checked on us. Ever. Gave two stars because he bumped down the price (as he should) and the chips and salsa were good.",

    "text": "After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.  Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.  They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?  We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.  I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill.   Overall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.",

When we ordered our drinks, we got the typical \"you're not ordering anything else tonight?/Well, I guess I'd better go work some other tables for a bigger tip\" vibe from our waitress.  So what? Serve ALL of your customers the same and you'll be compensated.  Silly.  Yummy margaritas, though.  Chips and salsa don't QUITE compare to Aunt Chilada's, but they were better than most (ahem...chain restaurants...).",

    "text": "I have been to this place a couple of times once for dinner and a couple of times for happy hour. And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.  The food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better  The best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place.   Another good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two.   I would highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "This restaurant closes their doors at 10pm SHARP!! My mom and I arrived at the restaurant at 10pm. The hostess planned to close the restaurant. Thank you Manager of the restaurant for letting us stay!!  We basically had 5 minutes to look at the menu. Our waitress wanted us out ASAP. I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section.   Anyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!! Our basket of chips had three varieties: corn tortilla, blue corn tortilla, and a sweet and spicy chip. I really liked the sweet and spicy chip since it tasted like a slightly spicy churro. Yum!  The salsa had a black bean flavor and chunks of tomatoes. Also yummy.  The food came out so quickly!! It took like 10 minutes for the food to come out. Haha.  I had the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast. mMmMM.. the stuffing was so good!! I loved the herb-goat cheese mixed with the red pepper cream sauce and the cilantro pesto. The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!  My mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!  It was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY! I only eat white chocolate so I was so excited to eat this. Loved the nuts and the sweetness.   Again, our waitress was not very nice to us. So I'm taking off a point for the service.  We were out the door by 10:40pm.",

The meal started out with the chips and salsa which were pretty amazing.  The salsa had more bite to it than normal salsa you'd get at Macayo's or Arriba's.  The chips were a wide variety that included everything from sweet potato to blue corn to a white corn with a sugar coating.  I got the carnitas platter and my boyfriend got the enchiladas and carnitas dish.  The carnitas were mouthwatering.  The combination of the meat with the guacamole and rice made the tacos to die for.  The cheese used in the enchiladas was rich and mouthwatering.  Different than just the typical cheddar cheese.  For dessert, I had the banana burrito which was okay.  I much prefer the banana tempura at Benihana.  Besides the fact that the food was so good, I give Sam's Cafe 4 stars because I lost a piece of jewelry while dining and the staff helped me find it :)  Definitely would return here.",

I typically go here every time I come to Phoenix, and it's pretty great. the outdoor seating with the Grotto view is really really gorgeous.   The chips and salsa are FANTASTIC!!!! You get an assortment of chips and they are the best I've ever had.   The blackened fish tacos set my mouth on FIRE. I had no idea they would be COVERED in chili powder. too extreme for me.   Typically you get, white chocolate wrapped in a tamale leaf to cleanse your pallet after you are finish with your meal, which is one of my favorite parts of dinner ... but our waitress forgot :( ... definitely ask!   I would say this is your typical \"mexican/southwest\" restaurant, where the entire menu is basically variations of taco salad, 10 different variations of quesadillas, and tacos of some sort, and 3 pages of different margaritas and drinks with \"loco\" in the name.   Not too bad, not great either. I personally prefer the Greek place next door :)",

It was a nice mix of torilla chips and sweet potato chips. The service overall was really friendly and prompt and I didn't have a whole lot of complaints on that end.  My one complaint? The portions served. I got a chimichanga that looks like a fried burrito from chipotle with a side salad. It was a pretty good chimichanga, but i didn't feel that great after eating the body weight of a newborn with a side salad to boot. As you can tell, I'm not big on leaving anything on my plate.   Lastly, the cherry on the frosting for me was the white chocolate pecan dessert thing they give you at the end. It's their version of the chocolate mints that they give you with the bill.

    "text": "Canyon Cafe has the potential to be an idyllic restaurant, but falls short on nearly all aspects one desires in a dining experience. I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.  Canyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.  My first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect!   My fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.  In the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.  This particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old.   I'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,  \"Oh, you're not finished?\"     No. \"Just enjoying the weather?\"     ..........  I think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch to mix up the usual subway/corner cafe I usually go to throughout the work week.  To start, I must say their chips were absolutely amazing! What a pleasant departure from the normal tortilla chips that are served at every other Mexican place. The complimentary basket includes several different kinds of chips with a salty seasoning that is out of this world! It reminded me a bit of Steak n Shake seasoning or Lowrys - delicious! I also enjoyed the salsa, tasted very fresh and made in-house.  I went with the blue cheese and steak quesadilla per the servers suggestion (I couldn't decid between the enchiladas and quesadillas). It was pretty yummy and about what I expected. Paired with the dips that it came with (some sort of cilantro/avocado spread and a smokey chipotle) it was gobbled up in no time!  My only drawback is the lack of lunch pricing. I'd love to come back but ~$17 for a quesadilla and soda at lunchtime? I can't be doing that super often.   Will return again in another couple weeks to explore more of the menu!",

    "text": "I was semi-hungry and was wandering around downtown Phoenix and found this Southwestern themed restaurant here in the mall. I figured since I'm here for a few days, that it would be nice to try something that is \"Southwestern\".  Came here for lunch and it was relatively empty and I sat at the bar. Nice clean area, with a couple of tv's for the sports fanatics. The servers were pretty friendly too. Although some of the servers were super bored since there were not a lot of customers.  Again, I wanted something Southwestern so I went with their Desert Fire Pasta. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=AykZwJA1xSgxLOBaWbWHOg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5...</a> It's basically shrimp and fresh mushrooms over angel-hair pasta in a jalapeno cream sauce. Topped with Parmesan cheese and pico de gallo. This pasta was pretty much soaked with butter. Is that a typical Southwestern thing? Because if so, I would feel light headed all the time if I lived here.  And for dessert, I got their fried banana burrito with ice cream <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=PpE4HMvbpTU7mJdb19VlZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5...</a>. Nice presentation actually. It's a great theme for a Southwestern style dessert.  Tip: Use your yelp check in to get a free dessert.  Overall, a decent experience, though just a bit fattening to me with all that cream and butter.   Went to downtown a couple of times, and this place was desolate. I mean everywhere else as well. Not sure why, but it can be a good thing but you must also wonder why...oh well.",

The margaritas get four stars because the price was right during happy hour but I have to admit it I really didn't taste any tequila.

    "text": "Great find thanks to Yelp! My family and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem popped up.  It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains.   I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll.   Our server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world.   We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous. You can tell everything was prepared fresh, so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit.   Next time we go back I'll definitely try the table-side guacamole...that looked really good and probably tastes really fresh.",

The construction really threw me off.   This place boasts a Sonoran style of food. Not quite TexMex, not quite Mexican - something for the American taste buds in between.  I got the fish tacos, which were spicy and flavorful. I didn't care for the side salad - it was bitter. But I liked adding the side salsa for extra texture.   The chips and salsa were fun, though I prefer traditional corn chips and these tasted too much like an off-brand of Doritos.   The table salsa didn't feel worth the price tag for me, but it was okay.  This seems like a fun place to go for happy hour, or with a large group to sit on the beautiful patio. Give it a shot, don't expect anything to taste \"authentic\", and check in for a free dessert while it lasts! Definitely recommend the tres leches.",

Even though it ended up getting extremely busy in there, she was always smiling and helpful and made sure we got our food fast and our drinks filled. I was just very impressed with how she kept her cool under what might have been a stressful situation. It definitely made the dinning experience great!",

In hindsight we probably could split one entree. We had fajitas (Steak) and chicken tacos. Started with table made guacamole. Nice job and they ask if there are any of the ingredients you don't want in your personally prepared version.   The white chocolate pecan tamales were a nice treat with the check. We actually had checked in on yelp and had a free desert but just were too full to take advantage.",

I really enjoyed the complimentary assorted seasoned chips. It had flavorful corn, flour, blue and sweet potato chips! The salsa was just average though, which is a bummer.   I ordered the special of the day which was green pork stew. The pork wasn't very tender but I liked the flavor. It had hominy an the rest was soup-like. It came with flour tortillas and black beans. I wish it had rice too.  Husband ordered grilled chicken tacos. He didn't really enjoy it because it wasn't like a traditional taco, but I thought it was okay. It had pieces of grilled chicken with shredded cabbage, picked onion and something like a Chipotle sauce. The rice was underwhelming which was disappointing.   I would probably return if I was really hungry and I had no where else to go. The decor is nice but the food and service was average only.",

The wings were ok, pretty greasy & nothing spectacular. The margarita was good. When you arrive they give you complimentary chips and salsa. Don't get excited about it, because the chips were covered in heavy seasoning and salsa was very thick, smoky & heavy with adobo.

Our drinks arrived with a basket of chips with salsa.  These chips were incredible.  First, you notice a variety of colors and shapes, second you notice they are warm, almost hot, third the fantastic flavor.  They have a dusting of some sort of mild spice.  There were regular corn chips, blue corn chips, flour chips, squash (?) chips, sweet potato chips..lightly salted and the chipotle salsa complemented the combination.  We ordered our meals and knocked off the chips waiting for our food to arrive.  We ordered more chips, (still hot when they arrived from the kitchen) and our meals arrived. My wife had an enchilada something and I had the southwest chicken salad.  Those chips really enhanced the meal.  The flour chips were lighter and softer, yet crispy and not oily.  The sweet potato chips were slightly chewy and were indeed \"sweet\" and were great.  I had iced tea, my wife had a couple of blue margaritas and said they were very good.  We finished our meals and the chips.  Our waitress brought us a nice white chocolate \"tamale\" with our check.  If you are looking for a full meal or just want a nice place for a beer or cocktail this is the place.  Try the chips and salsa.",

Our server Frederica was so great! We told her about how we were going to drive all over the state and site see in the days to come, we pulled out a map and she gave us the best routes to drive, best scenic views, she said if we needed more information she'd call her dad and we could ask him questions. I'm glad we had her as a server and we're so glad we listened to her advice!",

I was on a quick lunch break so I ordered off the light lunch menu and had a chicken quesadilla, which had carmalized onions and gave it a sweet taste. I will definitely be back! Yum!  4 Stars due to the fact that we requested 2 bowls of the salsa, but additional chips were never brought to the table. Maybe a good thing as I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl :)",

I also had the street tacos which were delicious. The service on the other hand was a different story. Our waitress Denise M was so rude. I had to ask multiple times to get my water refilled and she was rushing us with ordering and the check. Very disappointed in the service but the food was delicious. If you decide to try this restaurant out hopefully you get a different server because the food was delicious.",

Loved the house-made chips they bring as soon as you're seated - not just your average tortilla chips but also wontons and sweet potato chips, and all with a nice sized bowl of a really flavorful smoky chipotle-style salsa - delish!  It's a good thing the kitchen is quick because my Cobb salad that came out a short time later was gigantic.  I would probably say this is one of the top Cobbs I have ever had - every item on it tasted fresh and crisp and good quality, and there were a lot of unique items included - oh so much more than your average Cobb. I planned all week to go back at night for dinner and margaritas but never did make it - boo!",

The weather outside was awesome and we wanted to sit outside but the noise from the fountains/waterfalls up against the patio was really loud to talk over so we sat inside.    The chips and salsa they brought out was amazing.  The bowl had 4 different types and flavors of chips and the salsa had a good taste and spice without being too hot.  For a meal i picked the Meatloaf and it was a ton of food.  2 huge pieces meatloaf that was seared on a grill after it was cooked came out with corn & mashed potatoes and a roasted tomato BBQ sauce.  I ate the whole thing (even though it was more food that i should have eaten) and i didn't feel bad!.  The meeting was a little hard to pay attention to though since the windows faced the pathway and the women from ASU downtown and all of the businesses kept walking by!!!",

I ordered a house special margarita, that they will only sell two of to you.  The drink was made out of fresh juices and a healthy pour of tequila. Wow it was delicious.   A unique basket of chips was dropped off at out table.  Different kinds of chips with a great spice on them and what appeared to be a restaurant made salsa.  Absolutely delicious.  Really, fantastic flavors in a great combination.   Had a chimichangas for my meal.  It was really good as well.  Crunchy outside with a real intense flavored chicken inside.  I will without a doubt return next time I am in Phoenix.",

So, we got our drinks and we order the Queso dip to start our meal off and then we ordered our food.   Then the Queso dip came out.  It was really good, but it was also a little runny.    Now for our food, when they were handing us the food.  The lady was passing the fajitas across me to my coworker and the juice from the fajitas spilled all over me and my meal.  Luckily I had my napkin in my lap, but it still got on my jeans.  You would think that a manager would come over and apologize for what happen or at least comp my food.  Instead they told me that they would pay for my dry cleaning bill, if I wanted to get my jeans dry cleaned.      Other than the spill the meal was great. I ordered the basin Meatloaf. I totally recommend the meatloaf.  It was one the best meatloaf I have had in a long time.  Last but not least our waiter was really nice and did a great job taking care of us.",

It eventually became apparent she was training, but no one ever told us this before we asked her.  We ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which we had to remind her what we ordered and it took an excessive amount of time to arrive.  We had ordered guacamole as well, and had to ask about it after not receiving it, her response was \"oh yeah.\"  I didn't see her waiting on any other tables, so I'm not sure what was so difficult. The food was okay, not spectacular.   I might come back, but better supervision of a training server would be nice.",

I had the carnitas plate and it was very moist and portions were plenty. The flavor was very good. We also took advantage of a yelp check in free desert and the banana burrito was great with banana wrapped in a crispy sweet tortilla topped with ice cream.  The food was great and vibe was really nice on a nice breezy, summer day. The waitress was very helpful, good service and the chef actually brought out samples of desert that I can not remember the name but it was a nice touch.

Lots of outdoor seating right there by the palm trees and water fountains at Arizona Center. There are usually a few birds squawking and chirping in the background as well. No charge for this entertainment.   Tried several dishes (NOT all in one sitting!), including tacos and enchiladas. All excellent.   Full bar and indoor seating as well if desired. Friendly staff each visit.   And here's a nice touch: they give out these corn husk-wrapped white chocolates as complimentary dessert. Make sure you unwrap those husks or you'll be in for a nasty surprise.   The goods are on the inside. Not the outside.   But on the inside? Savory, cool white chocolate. It tastes a bit like butter pecan ice cream (if anyone can even remember that flavor, which seems to have gone the way of vinyl albums and phone booths).   Check out the Canyon Cafe.

    "text": "Good Lord, it's so annoying when a business has an ineffective social media presence.   I've been trying to write a favorable review for Canyon Cafe for ages, and every time I go to answer a question for myself, I stumble into their social media circle of death.  Their Website: Outdated.  Facebook: More like an online journal than a business website. 579 Likes. No recent posts. Mostly my photos from previous visits.  Press: Two old propaganda \"articles;\" one from New Times and one from DTPHX; and one random blogger piped in several years ago to say they liked their multicolored chips.  Twitter/Instagram: ??  But why is their website and social media important to your Yelp restaurant review? Why? W H Y??  I'll tell you why: The owners don't care enough to invest in their own company's public image; they're not on top of their game; something's amiss, but what?  According to their website, \"at the end of 2002, Bruce Lazarus and Doug Czufin led a small group of dedicated managers and chefs from the large public company and began operating a small private company...\"  Ugh, what?!? What large public company? What small private company? Which chefs? What are you talking about?  Well, I'll tell you. Canyon Cafe Acquisition Company LLC, is a former subsidiary of Avado Brands Inc. It seems that the website is suggesting that Canyon Cafe is somehow better because it's now held by smaller company than it was previously held by, yet it's held by a company dedicated to acquisitions. And, as a side note, plenty of great restaurants are held by big corporations, but whatever, you do you, Canyon Cafe.  It goes on to say, \"...that's what the Southwest is all about...\"  But according to their website, they have locations in Missouri. Is Missouri the Southwest?  Then it randomly says, \"visit our sister restaurant 1130 The Restaurant at the AZ Center,\" with no links nor explanation.  Ok, but HOW'S the restaurant? How's their food?  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  My friends and I have been going to the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center for years, and depending on what food/restaurant they want to try, that's what we do.   And one of those times, they picked Canyon Cafe.  Canyon Cafe is in a SUPER pretty location. The courtyard, with the mature palms and water fountains, are delightful. Also, the architecture is lovely. They also have a very cozy patio setup.  We sat at the bar, and although it wasn't packed, the service wasn't fast.  The chips were indeed multicolored, and the salsa seemed scratch-made. I preferred the fresh guacamole.  I'm all about the frozen mango margaritas. They were very good, albeit a tad watery.  We also tried their chicken quesadilla, which I liked very much. I'm a sucker for cheese melted on a tortilla, and folded over.  The server/bartender was pleasant, not fast, and not memorable in general: Break even.  CONCLUSION  I can't see how this business stays alive, other than from the weekday downtown crowd and the Phoenix Convention Center traffic.  The atmosphere is the best part.  Canyon Cafe is good, but not specifically seek it out good.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Locations: San Antonio, Texas, St. Louis, Missouri, and Phoenix, Arizona.  *Parking is dreadful. Good luck.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcanyoncafe.com&s=50cf460d53d35632d72b2d0f1eb42668350f449f9a37009621a5c7e48a348d9e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">canyoncafe.com</a>",

    "text": "I remember the first time we had a White Chocolate wrapped tamale.  It was here, about ten years ago.   Canyon Cafe is a fun, southwest culinary stop - that your taste buds will thank me for later. Whenever, we're near the AZ Center, we try to make a stop here (boy, do we still miss their Biltmore location).  So in Yelp lingo... yes, we are a Fan.   Mind you, don't get me wrong, they're not perfect - which is why this isn't a Five Star review.  But Canyon Cafe has so many things going for it, it's an easy Four Stars.  A no brainer.   First, let me start with the chips and salsa. Their pita chips are made in three different styles, Chinese Puff Wonton, Sweet Potato and a Sweet & Spicy combo (photo).    I could write a few hundred words on each.  Their complex flavors, the spices used and yet, the star here is their smokey chipotle mole Salsa. Wow, what an incredible layer of flavors. It's chocolate base comes through ever so gently, with a hint of heat that doesn't overwhelm. Nice.   Second, what to drink. Every Mexican inspired restaurant has a bunch of margaritas on their menu. And somewhere in that predictable and pedantic, sirupy mess is some tequila. Yawn. Boring.   Canyon Cafe's drinks are a must. Names like Grand Canyon, (which is a Prickly Pear Catcus nectar type), Blue Moon (made from Blue Curacao), and Mango Rita are all delicious. Really outstanding. But our favorite, is their Raspberry Chambord flavored Coyote mix. It's a must.   Okay, what's for dinner?  Everything here is good and their fish tacos are the best.  But tonight, we went with the \"Naked\" Chile Relleno and the Panchos Enchiladas roasted chicken, both were $13.   Their charred poblano pepper Chili Relleno, reminds me of some of the best we've had in Santa Fe (photo). It's a fajita marinated steak, with adovo mushrooms, beans, light melted cheese, and a level 4/10 heat index ranchero sauce, served on a bed of rice. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth. The rice itself is outstanding.  I even took a photo of it, so you could see how complex and interesting it is.   The Enchiladas comes with chucks of chicken, Jack cheese and a three pepper cream sauce (photo). It's fresh tomato salsa is nothing like the mole serviced with the chips, it's light and tasty. It also comes with its own southwest rice and greens.   For dessert, we used our free Yelp Coupon and went with the flourless chocolate cake. It was thick, rich and chewy. Nice!  Our server Kristen presented us with our white chocolate wrapped tamale (no mas!), and the bill which came to $58.74, including taxes but before gratuities. Kristen was always nearby and very friendly & pleasant; so ask to sit in her section.   Enjoy,",

    "text": "As soon as the waitress brought out the chips and homemade salsa I knew this place was going to be great!  They use a combination of corn, flour, and sweet potato chips, not just the standard corn tortillas.  The salsa is so complex in flavors it is hard to describe in words except, OMG! was it great.  I wanted to try something which was a sample of their menu so I chose the enchilada and carnitas combination.  For the enchilada option I chose the green chili chicken.  Everything promptly arrived and was a very nice size portion.  From the first bite of chicken enchilada to the flavorful pork carnitas, everything was fabulous!  The service was top notch and the waitress never failed to impress.  She was attentive and very polite.  The location is in the center of a kinda \"defunct\" retail shopping center called the Arizona Center located in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  The shopping center has apparently been there since 1990.  I am not from Phoenix so I have no idea why what appears to be a great concept urban shopping and dining has seemed to fail.  However do not let the failing shopping center around the restaurant scare you, the Canyon Grill's outdoor seating could not be better with a nice park like setting complete with man made running water falls, streams, etc.  Very clean and perfectly manicured.  If you are looking for a great \"southwestern\" style Mexican grill this is a great option.  Btw, I hear their margaritas are the bomb!  I was not able to sample this trip but the descriptions on the their menu sounded yummy!  I will definitely return the next time I am in Phoenix.",

I realize that the 100+ degree weather is a downer, but I've seen maybe 100 people in my whole day. Most of them working.  So needless to say, the Cactus Cafe was not busy. In the over an hour I was there no more than 10 people came through the door. The atmosphere was great. The chips and salsa was very good, the chips were seasoned with chili and were of different varieties which is different from the chips I expect at a normal place.  I was recommended the Chicken Tamales which were delicious. They were served with a normal salad, and I think they could be more creative for a side dish than just a plain romaine lettuce salad. By checking in on Yelp I received a free dessert which was a great bonus. The server recommended the Banana Burrito, which I will recommend to everyone. Who doesn't love deep fried tortilla filled with bananas served with ice cream covered in chocolate and caramel. It was delicious. The price was bearable for a downtown atmosphere, basically what I expected, but the desert as a bonus really made it worth it.",

I asked my host about the other place and he told me I was close by and pointed out the correct area. I asked him which establishment was better, he replied, \"our food is fresh\". The gentleman was very much correct. The food was very fresh. I'll start by saying if you have to have your Mexican food as usual and you aren't option to new or require huge portions, you may not like this place. Ordered a quesadilla which came with a margarita slaw item that I just knew I would throw out. Joke was on me after tasting it. The stuff was so good but I'll be honest and say I love fresh produce and I'm a salad eater. Chips and salsa were uniquely different since no chip looked the same and there was a bowl of seasoned tortilla chips and kettle chips. My group and I liked the food, price not so much since I was starving within 2 hours.",

Went here on a Sunday afternoon and seating was immediate. The server was really great! She was personable, knowledgeable about the menu, and pretty darn cute to boot! We got the table side guacamole to start which went over very well. Tacos were had by everyone including a special request that the kitchen had no problem filling. I got the grilled chicken tacos and they were pretty good. I put a fair amount of hot sauce on them but the flavors were very good. A nice place to stop in downtown Phoenix.",

Our waitress \"Topeka\" was excellent, and she was a one person show making the homemade table side guacomole, along with being a top notch wait staff person too.

The first trip there provided a waitress who never brought the cheese dip we ordered. When I asked her to take it off our check, she said, \"ok\".  Never an apology or \"oh my gosh! I forgot!\"  Nothing. She came by a couple of times to refill the empty water glasses them disappeared until the food and check were brought out.   Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we went back the next day. Again, beautiful atmosphere from the patio. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS!!!! The food and service were mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which sounded somewhat healthy but came out greasy.   So my advice: go!! Get the chips and salsa. Although I didn't have one, I hear the margaritas are good, too. Enjoy the patio and beautiful Phoenix weather. Just don't expect too much from the rest of the food or service.",

The premium margarita is excellent and the chips are a nice mix of fresh spicy styles. This is my third visit and I enjoyed the carnitas and enchilda platter. The enchiladas were great and had an unusual white sauce that really made the meal. The carnitas was well prepared, but a little fatty for my taste.    As others have said, uneven service remains a challenge. The staff works hard, is friendly and trys to be attentive, but somehow come up just a bit short. Remembering details like split checks or dessert requests seem too much. If you have time to linger and people watch, none of this will be a problem. They seem to cater to conference visitors and folks coming downtown for the day. This may be your best option in the area.   A final thought. While the desserts are not spectacular, they are good. The banana burrito stands our from the rest. It is tasty, a bit like bananas foster in a fried tortilla, but the use of Hershey's syrup leaves the experience falling short. And that summarizes the entire experience. Good for an area where you wouldn't expect good, but still short of what it might be.",

She could have said \"unfortunately we aren't seating right now but once I know more I will let you know!\"  Anyway, we went to the bar to see if we could at least get a drink while we waited. We're sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting.... No acknowledgement or greeting from the bartenders. The only time we are acknowledged is when he says \"chips?\" We said no, we'd like some drinks, but he never got back to us. And the bar wasn't even busy!! While waiting there, I see the hostess seat two tables so I go up to her to see if they're seating now. She says, \"well they're find with sitting and snacking on chips - are you? Because I don't have a server for you.\" Wow. How nice. No, we have a movie to catch and don't want to sit around and wait when you can get a server.  Basically, it was one of the worst experiences I've had - no table after we made a reservation, no acknowledgement at the bar, and no servers able to take us. Very impressed... not!",

    "text": "Yummy Margarita, interesting fried calamari, and fabulous blackened fish tacos!  We decided we wanted Mexican Thursday night and found out within a walking distance of the Convention center you have about 3 choices for dinner. The one closest was indicated as herendous, so we immediately skipped it. One of the \"ambassadors\" suggested this place and said the carnitas were fabulous.  We arrived right about 6pm and had no trouble getting seated outside. Our waitress was really friendly and happy. I started with a house margarita (rocks, salt of course) and it came in a shaker that help pretty much the equivalent of 2!!  Hence the limit to 2 to a person!  Very tasty! I didn't think it was very strong till i got up and started to walk around!  The chips and salsa were interesting. There were 2 different type of chips - some puffy with a bit of sweetness, some regular. Definitely tasty. And the salsa was good!  We started with corn encrusted calamari - very interesting and yummy! I did the blackened fish tacos, hubby went with the steak and blue cheese quesadilla. The fish was amazing! Make sure you get extra salsa! The quesadilla was weird - not something we would get again.",

    "text": "Pleasant spot for a margarita-filled lunch or dinner. 3.5 stars  Highlights: - Margaritas: I loved the fruity grand canyon one (lime, prickly pear, etc.) and the hub got an adult version of a milkshake canister with his 2-limit margarita (got 4 glasses out of that thing!) - Outside/inside seating: outside was nice on a patio especially at night overlooking some blue lit up trees and misters for the heat, but inside was a nice A/C haven for the height of the sunny day. - Chips: combo of sweet wontony, yellow corn, orange spiced, and blue corn as well as sweet potato chips. It's rare to find such variety. - Salsa: great roasted flavor - Pork: carnitas was a large portion of meat--quite juicy and tasty - Menu: pure mex and southwestern mex as well as pastas and salads - Dessert: creative presentation with white chocolate pecans enveloped in a tamale wrapper. Complementary item which was a nice touch. - Staff: super duper friendly which I appreciated  Lowlights: - Crabcake: too dense cornmealy for me--couldn't taste much flavor or crab - Fish: didn't taste too fresh and advertised that veggies would be in the mix, but only limited slivers to were found.  Decent spot. I'd come again for chips and margaritas.",

    "text": "This was one person's favorite spot in our margarita tour.   We had great service. It was however dead in the middle of the day on a Monday at the bar so made sense. We were there for over an hour and the waitress gave us our space and yet checked in regularly from the kitchen which was great.  They offer both on the rocks and frozen varieties of a margaritas which was great for us. Good lime flavor, good proportions of booze and very fruity. The chips and salsa were interesting. The chips were sweet and extra crispy like wontons. The salsa was a chipotle deep red style. It went together well and we liked it.   I also ordered a taco al a-carte. They don't usually do that but it was quite that they could accommodate my request. I got a whole piece of fish (seriously a whole fillet) in a double shell taco (corn and blue corn). The salsa and blackened seasoning was good- not amazing but it was huge and helped me with my margarita. Thank you!",

The chips they start you off with are to-die-for!  You could just eat them and be happy :)  Comes with roasted salsa which is some of the best I've had.  I normally don't drink, but couldn't resist one of their blended margaritas, which was delicious and so refreshing! (cranberry and pear flavors).  Hubby looooved his mango margarita and had a second.    Waiter was attentive and friendly.  Ordered one of the salads with chicken and enjoyed every bite.  Also don't forget to get your free dessert (2 with two entrees!) on Yelp.  We picked the chocolate flour less cake and all I can say is YUMMMMM!  If I lived nearby, this restaurant would be my go-to for sure!!",

Yes, we planned on going somewhere else BUT they were closed! HOWEVER we did stumble upon a diamond in the rough!!   OKAY, review time: Diamond in the rough!!  We stopped to look at the menu before walking in and committing. Everything I read sounded so good! I wanted to try everything!   Thomas greeted us as soon as we walked in the door. He had the biggest smile on his face and was very polite. He walked us to our table and was joking around with us. One of the best hostess I've had! He sat us down at a large table near the back of the restaurant. Took our drink order and brought us chips and salsa.   Pricilla our waitress was very friendly as well. She took great care of us! Stayed on top of keeping our drinks full. We had to know all the different types of chips used in their mix and she knew them all! I loved the salsa, and had to know what they did different and she was so quick to answer! She knows the menu very well and was very knowledgeable. Great service the entire time very happy we came across this place!  The chips were all amazing in their own way. The salsa which was my favorite because the roast their chilies. YUM, we had to keep asking for more because I love to load my chips up! (Thanks Pricilla for refilling them so many times!) I had the side salad and a cup of the Poblano chicken soup. So good and creamy, I wanted to go back and get some when we had all that rain and snowy weather! I tried my moms \"naked\" chile relleno, it was my second choice to get. It was very tasty and tons of flavor!! I defiantly have to bring my husband back to try out something!! Eventually ill have to try one of everything!   Towards the end of the meal we had gotten a slice of cheesecake for dessert, to share. (sorry not pictured) Because we ate it all before I even had a chance!   Compliments to the chef that night who I had to find out their name, Chef Jamie. Amazing team you have in the back the food was outstanding! Thank you for the special treat (it was white chocolate I believe) at the end of the dessert. We all enjoyed that, it came in a corn husk! YUM!  Can not wait to come back from more chips and salsa and to try out something new!",

Seasoned perfectly and the flour were my favorite!  Salsa was really good to and I couldn't stop eating them.    Southwest cooking influenced by Mexican, Spanish, Native American and Western US cultures.  Their service was excellent, our waiter was up beat, took the time to explain the menu or any questions we had.  I ordered the blackened Fish Tacos and they were really good with a chipotle sauce and slaw.  I would definitely order it again.  The meal felt light and just good.  There were a few things I wanted to order from the menu and I would recommend you give this place a try!    They kept the drinks coming and our waiter was attentive.  They offer nice patio seating.  And to top it off, we were presented with white chocolate wrapped tamale to finish our meal.  YUM!",

Talk about some good flavors.  First of all, if the dish includes goat cheese, it probably has already won me over.  You add creamy red pepper sauce (not spicy), a little pico de gallo, some asparagus and put it all on a bed of rice pilaf and I'm one happy camper!  Our waitress was nice.  Not the most attentive (considering we were the only ones in the dining room at first), but she was pleasant.  I wouldn't go back here based on just the service in other words.  The chips and salsa was a bit of a miss for me.  They seemed like they were fresh chips, but they were a strange mixture of sweet and salty that was a bit confusing.  Plus, we had a ton of broken chips so it was hard to enjoy the salsa.  Will I be back?  Probably.  I don't know if I'll want to try something else since I enjoyed the chicken so much.",

I thought it has an interesting taste. Honestly, I prefer queso blanco and this was yellow.  They have a gluten free menu which is great!  They didn't have many gluten free options on the kids menu however they were great about accommodating us. My daughter and I split the fajitas. They were good except for the corn tortillas. They tore so easily that we couldn't really use them to put all do the fajita goodies into.  My husband ordered the blackened salmon salad but the waitress came back and informed us that they were out of salmon so he went with chicken. In all reality, she should've known that and told us as soon as we ordered.   The food was pretty good. The service, not so great!  Our cups were empty more than full and we had to ask for everything.  The waitress was nice although she never did introduce herself. She just walked over and told us about the specials.   At the end of the meal she did bring over complimentary white chocolate tamales. That was a nice finishing touch.   All in all it was decent. If they fix the corn tortillas and have better service they really could be great. If we had better service for sure I would've given more stars.",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix for a work conference and stayed at the Sheraton, right across this restaurant. Last night, we decided to dine at this place. We were a group of 18 people, and were split up in two tables.   Our server, Pricill (got her name from the bill), seemed a bit tired and annoyed. For example, if I repeated to her that I want salsa, her answer would be, \"I heard you the first time. I'll get.\" There were many instances where her responses were very curt and impolite. And she was very slow. The restaurant was not very crowded, but it took her a while to take our orders. So the service was below average for me.   Now to the food: - The chips and salsa were delicious. Their chips are different from the normal tortilla chips. Loved it. - Guacamole: this was a bit too salty and lacked lemon juice. The server made it in front of us, but I've definitely had better guacamole.  - Grilled Vegetable Tacos: this dish was very disappointing. The veggies were raw and not seasoned or sauteed. I had one bite and couldn't eat anymore. I removed the veggies and had the taco with rice and beans. The veggies also has a burnt flavor to it. Imagine raw burnt veggies in your taco.   Overall, a thumbs down for me. If you are looking for Mexican food, just look for other options in the area.",

    "text": "We ate here for the first time on May 18th. What a great find! We received tickets to see Diary of Anne Frank so stopped here first.  The chips and salsa were brought to the table initially upon sitting along with getting our drink order. We loved the smokey deep taste of the salsa but the chips not so much, although we ate them. They were a combination of flour and corn and had seasoning on them. I asked about getting some without seasoning and was told that was how they were served. Would have liked them better without seasoning. Ordered the table side guacamole and it was so delicious! Chunky and flavorful!  I ordered the tortilla soup, which was so good.  Rich broth, big chunks of chicken along with tortilla strips.  Partner had the carnitas, which we will definitely be back for!  Tortillas wrapped in corn husks, along with rice and beans.  Neither of cared for the black beans...found them too salty.  The rice was ok as well, full of taste and flavor (cumin I believe).  But the pork...so juicy and flavorful. Also comes with onions and peppers...the whole dish was so good.  Took advantage of the check in deal for dessert and we ordered the Tres Leches cake.  So good, rich, and yummy and was served with a strawberry sauce that just added to the entire experience.   Service was great and we really enjoyed sitting on the outside patio!  We will be back and will recommend.  Why the four stars?  Beans too salty and not having the ability to get the chips without seasoning on them.",

The food is so good, but the wait staff was inattentive and didn't even seem to care that we were there. It was also pretty empty on a Friday night. I think it's time for management to step up and get some motivation moving with the servers and staff.",

A ton of great menu options and good drink menu. The margaritas are strong and made with quality ingredients so they limit you to 2.  They start with fresh made chips and salsa. Salsa is homemade with a roasted flavor. It's not Spicy but very flavorful. The chips were amazing!! They are actually a assortment of flour tortilla chips, corn chips, sweet potato chips, and wonton chips. It was fun and creative to try all the different flavors. The sweet potato chips were like candy, so good!   I got the Southwest Cobb salad and it was amazing. Large with a ton of toppings. Everything tasted so fresh and packed with flavor. The blackened chicken was very tasty. My friend got the sante fe stuffed chicken breast and she loved it, it looked delicious too.   They serve these white chocolate and pecan wrapped in a corn husk for free with your bill. Tasty treat at the end of the meal.   The service was okay but the food was amazing and you could taste the quality ingredients. I would definitely recommend and love to come back. Thank you!",

I was hoping that being closer to the border than my hometown of Chicago would mean some solid taco action.  I was wrong.  The food was mediocre...edible but very gringo tacos.  I opted for the shrimp tacos, which were flavorful but far from authentic.  Colleagues went for the fajitas and said the same thing.  The service was good and they have a lovely outdoor patio on nights when it's not too hot.  I had a raspberry margarita. It was good, but again, nothing to write home about.  In sum, it was a convenient option near our hotel but far from the best tacos/Tex-Mex I've ever had.",

The hostess and manager ( assuming) seemed annoyed by the fact that we asked why we couldn't sit at the plethora of empty tables, to clean the tables around the bar and explanation as to why no one wanted to help. Visiting with a convention and being treated the way we were makes me EXTREMELY unhappy and wouldn't recommend anyone visit this establishment.  The only saving grace is Sal. He was super helpful.",

My end of the table demolished our bowl in minutes and then grabbed the one from the other end.   The entrees left a bit to be desired, however. Lots of seafood - which just doesn't seem right in the desert. I would have liked more traditionally tex-mex dishes to choose from as I eventually settled on the enchilada and carnitas platter, which was OK.   All things considered, it was a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back next time business brings me to Phoenix.",

    "text": "Yep still a fan. Mostly of the Grand Canyon Margaritas, they soothe away the pains of the day.  They have what I have now seen to be a rotating list of Happy Hour food options which are usually not bad and range from $2-$6. I usually fill up on chips and salsa. I have not changed my mind on the seasoning they use on the chips (sweet...spicy...meeh) I find myself picking through the basket to avoid the highly seasoned chips. The salsa is good but the large tomato chunks make it tough to get on a chip, or when you do it is hard to get from that point to your mouth without it falling off (usually on my chest or lap). I have yet to order from the regular/full menu. Maybe one day!",

I like the ahi salad a lot, which is a spicy seared ahi with their raspberry vinagrette, and the chimichanga is awesome. Dine on the patio or the bar for the best service, as sometimes inside it can be terrible. The patio is also great in the evening when the place is lit up with christmas lights and you get the view of the beautiful water features and scuptures. Keep in mind the Arizona Center, being the lush green place it is, has somewhat of a cockroach problem in the summer when it is warm, and them suckers are HUGE. Never seen one near the restaurants though. The menu has something for everyone, and everything is decent. If not for the proximity to my home, and the patio, this would be a sub-par bet, however.",

We finally went and as I was less than hungry skipped the steak I had been eying. We split a Meatloaf and switched the mashed potatoes out for the mashed sweet potatoes. The two split plates were more than enough food for a regular meal. I can't imagine eating a whole one and I am a hearty eater. We also each ordered a Rico Rita. Yummy and again large portions. The service was good too. I used to go to the Camelback location and the quality and service is the same here. We will be back.",

There's really nice outdoor seating with some misters to cool you down on a hot summer day.   They always provide you with chips and salsa which are AH-MAY-ZING.  It's not your typical tortilla chips and salsa there's something extra special about these chips.    It's your standard tex-mex cuisine.  I really like their shrimp taco's.  The carnitas platter was pretty good but the pork was a bit too salty for me.  Their fajitas are always good.  The salmon is also pretty good.  Those are the typical dishes I get when I go.    When you end the meal they always give you white chocolate tamales to clean/cool your palate.  Always delish. ...  The place hasn't really disappointed me except for this past week when we purchased two pitchers of the Grand Canyon margaritas and there was more juice than there was tequila.  :-\\  but other than that it's pretty good.",

We skipped the appetizer only because we had tickets to a show but not to worry because the complementary chips and salsa are outstanding! You don't even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned, fresh and uniquely delicious. Husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before I could try it but he loved it. I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. We didn't have time for dessert but again, not to worry as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot. Next time we come to Sam's we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert. I also need to commend the attentive wait staff and pleasant atmosphere especially when the weather allows you to sit outside",

I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)! We were so pleased with our meal & service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky & tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD!  I will return on any visit to Phoenix!!",

The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent.",

She was very knowledgable about the city and the restaurant which I was surprised to find has a sister cafe in my town (St. Louis). I thought the food was good but not amazing.

Most of the group was about 10 mins late (I know I know...sad when most of us have GPS capable mobile phones).  We found it due to the friendly local police and Downtown Phoenix greeters (?).    The restaurant did not have a private room (we had a group of 15) but we were there really early.  The chip basket is AMAZING!  It has a bunch of different chips from tortilla, to different types of potates and even these fried pieces of goodness (that reminded me of wontons).  The salsa was really good too.  The waitstaff was great....they provided lots of these chip baskets during our 3 hour meeting.  When the meeting concluded...it was straight to the top shelf margaritas which we've been dying for since we sat down.  It's a great deal for top shelf tequila and the quantity.  You get about 2-4 drinks as they even give you some reserve in the cocktail shaker.    Food was good.  I had the sirloin which was cooked perfect at medium.  My friend sitting next to me ordered the same thing at medium rare but got it well done.  She sent it back and after a few minutes got a new one closer to the rare side but she was happy.  If I lived in the area and was able to visit again I could consider becoming a fan of this place.  Definitely check it out.  Another plus - they have a patio too!",

My co-workers and I walked up on the wrong side of the cafe and came through the patio area.  Normally, I don't think this would have been a problem, however this night they had the majority of the patio roped off for a private function and we looked like we were trying to crash it.  Oops.  No harm done, they still let us into the restaurant.  While waiting for everyone in the group to arrive, the two girls at the hostess stand were watching us with little to no expression on their face.  I felt a little uncomfortable, they were not friendly and welcoming by any means, but they eventually sat us none the less and our service was great from there out.  We decided to sit inside as it was a little warm outside.  The server was nice and even joked around with us a bit.  I ordered the Orange Beso margarita.  It was good, since it was made with vodka instead of tequila, it wasn't quite a margarita for me, but hey, it tasted good.  Since they drop off the shaker so you can refill your own, it was the margarita that seemed to never end.  That made me happy!  Plenty of other people have mentioned the cool assortment of chips and the great salsa so I won't get into details.  I just leave it that I loved both!  For my meal I ordered the Black & Blue quesadilla.  It sure was yummy!  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly and as I've mentioned in many other reviews, the right amount of blue cheese is always a winner in my book.  This quesadilla was right on the money, not overpowering with the blue cheese.  I ended up taking half of it home.  As plenty of other reviewers have mentioned, the white chocolate tamale was great finish for the meal.  I'm not so big on desserts, but I usually crave a bite or two of sweet to finish lunch or dinner and this did the trick!  I can't wait to go back on the weekend to relax on the patio, drink some margaritas, and try more food.  I think next time I'd like to try some tacos . . .",

That was because I wanted to sit outside and there was a big crowd at the time, sort of a convention that must have all gone to eat at once.  Okay, that was fine. I waited at the bar and ordered iced tea, with no offer of sweetener.  Waited and was seated about 1/2 hour later.  Sat, and the menu looked good.  Ordered enchiladas.  When they came out so quickly I was surprised.  When I saw them, I couldn't help but think they had been sitting in a warming dish and that is why they were prepared so quickly.  Taste was lackluster.  \"Salad\" served with it was more like some chopped lettuce, that I couldn't tell if dressing had been put on it or not.  If there was I couldn't taste it.  Cheese on top was a sort of creamy cheese sauce, nothing to write home about.  Served on rice, it was sort of dry and not really hot...thus my thinking that they were sort of held warm until served.  No cheddar cheese, no guacamole, no beans.  This dish needed help!!!  Started to check in on YELP to rate while I was sitting there and noticed that I got a free dessert with my meal by checking in.  Had the cheesecake which was thick...if that is the word.  Bill was $14, which I thought was fair.  Had better.  If you are really desperate for good TexMex, and don't mind a drive, the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel in Scottsdale, yes hotel food, is amazing and a view to die for.  Yes, it's about 1/2 hour away by car, but I think next time I'll make the drive.",

I've been underwhelmed by an entree or two (note: don't bother with the steak), but in general, the food is good. The margaritas are large and potent. They have a small but good selection of beers on tap. The chips and salsa are good. I enjoy their quesadillas and burgers. The patio is a great place to have a lazy Saturday afternoon drink with friends.  While I like Sam's Cafe well enough, I know some people who absolutely love it, so I can confidently say it is worth a visit.",

It's really not that hard to please me with food, especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night.   I ordered one of their specials, which was the pork enchiladas. When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry.   I am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate, pecan thing they gave at the end. Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time.",

    "text": "I like the food at Sam's and I like the happy hour. I don't know if they've changed management or service since they changed their name to Canyon Cafe but the service here frustrated me so badly I had to give it 2 stars for \"I've experienced better.\"  The wait for food is rather long most times of the day, which, at lunch time especially, can suffice as a reason NOT to go here. You definitely won't make it back to work within an hour.    But here's the main reason I started boycotting Sam's. I went here with a friend who is allergic to cilantro once. She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one.   THEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute. How difficult was that? The lack of problem-solving skills among the staff here really astounded me, and for this reason, despite the fact that this place is super convenient to my job and home, I haven't been back since.",

I came here for lunch with a couple of buddies and from the very beginning I was impressed. We got seated right away and our chips and salsa came within seconds of sitting down! And let me just say, this is the BEST ASSORTMENT of chips I've ever had at a restaurant. There were typical white/yellow corn chips, along with blue chips and sweet potato chips and other stuff. Very tasty. The salsa tasted a little \"pre-made\" to me but it was still decent.   I ordered the carnitas and enchiladas platter. It was pretty good. The carnitas had good flavor (but there was only one tortilla) and the enchiladas had a good creamy sauce on top. I also liked the fact that they offered us a carafe of water so they didn't have to keep coming around to refill it for us. I know for some that seems a little lazy and cheesy, but I think it's AWESOME!  The best part was the little mini White-Chocolate/Pecan tamale at the end. It was REALLLLLLY good and wanted about 10 more. Bill was pretty cheap and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. Definitely going back.",

Our server told my date the specials while I was in the restroom, I got to hear the last one before he walked away. Nice. He returns to take our drink order, repeats it. Walks away. Returns with chips/salsa and my dates beer. No margarita for mama, I think maybe the bartender can't keep up with to 10 people here. Nope. Server forgot. Cuz he's so slammed, right?  We ask for more salsa, which finally comes with my drink. The chips are stale and the salsa is just blah, but we are starving.  After what seems like forever server comes back around offers to get my date another beer. Ignores my empty glass and tells us that our order should be next. 10 minutes later the food arrives. We can immediately tell it's been sitting for a long time. Plate is extremely hot and the food has a thick hard outside, cold in the middle. My meatloaf was dry, hard and flavorless. Potatoes might have been good had they been served within 20 minutes of being ready. My date's meal was also overcooked and bland.  I checked in via yelp and there was a free dessert offer, which I decided against since the rest of the meal sucked. No need to waste my daily calories on more sub par and disappointing food.  Slow/inattentive server+bad food= no return visit for me. Ever.  I think most of the reviews praising the cuisine and service have to be after several of  their \"limit 2\" margaritas have been consumed.",

I ended up getting the chile-rubbed sirloin with the double mash. The steam itself seemed a little dry, but it was still delicious. The mash potatoes had a similar seasoning as the chips, but seemed to be mixed with sweet potatoes too. I wasn't a fan, this took me by surprise.  The flavors are good, but definitely a little bit different!  Our server, Jennifer, was amazing. She was kind, attentive, and friendly!",

Chips&Salsa, table side guac, margaritas, white chocolate pecan \"tamales\" and superb service made our last meal here in Phoenix a memorable one!   SERVICE was excellent from everyone here. The hostess, server, and manager were great. In general, we felt everyone in AZ was friendly and this place was no exception. I had a few questions after seeing their menu and they were happy to answer them. My first two questions came after reading their sign at the front door: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#5bkxBk1xbLz1lfpCt1slkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5...</a>  WHAT?!? LIMIT 2 MARGARITAS?! I never heard of this!! Our server explained that each margarita order is actually 2 glasses full, each glass has 2oz of alcohol so they limit you to 2 orders = 4 glasses = 8oz of tequila. I guess it's True, 1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, floor. Recommend! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#9CoBAf2lHDm-VuDInPyyqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#0EvNrLfD3apsqZt0tNaaBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5...</a>  CHIPS and SALSA! This is not your ordinary chips and salsa! Like everyone else says, these are great! The salsa is awesome by itself and the 4 different types of chips - wonton, sweet potato,  blue&white corn tortilla (some of which were dusted with some magic sweet/salty/spicy rub) just hit the spot. Awesomely recommend.  TABLESIDE GUACAMOLE! Holy guacamole! They explain all the ingredients that go into their guacamole to make sure everyone is ok with them and then proceed to make the freshest and best guac...take notes because this stuff is good!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#iye-PBk09GNJJhpwsGFq5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5...</a>  The dinner entrees were just okay. Nothing special going on there. But by this time you are wasted from the the two margaritas so it doesn't really matter.   CHECK-IN on YELP, get free dessert! The white chocolate pecan tamales that arrived at our table were great, and this banana burrito was the free check-in offer!!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#APw9-23ZffmGQj9u4lAv6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5...</a>  I'm not gonna argue whether this place is authentic or not. I'm no expert. However, this place has stood the test of time, as we've visited this place multiple times over the past 10+yrs whenever we are in Phoenix because we like it.",

Anyone in the Downtown area for any reason should make it a point to visit this place. The fire pits in the evening are an amazing site as well. This place is 5 plus stars",

    "text": "Well where do I begin...we came in during happy hour and we sat at the bar, the bartender was nice and greeted us and whatnot. They have this free queso bar but totally not worth it, the melted cheese sucked, clumped together and too salty, also flies flying around. Now on to the main event, the bartender asked us what we wanted to eat, I ordered the wings, my wife ordered the mini pork chimis, and about 15 mins after ordering, the bartender comes back and says they only have enough wings for four wings and that I can order something else...I mean how do you run out of wings at like 6pm on a Tuesday? Now the nail on the head was that just as we were getting our food, my wife and I see a mouse running around on the floor and get caught in a mouse trap. The crazy thing was that the bartender just ran away when we pointed this out but didn't do anything. No one came and got the mouse for ten mins!! Now does anyone really expect us to eat the food?? I mean if the bar has a mouse, just imagine the kitchen!! No manager came and apologized to us, no one offered to comp our meal. It's ridiculous how bad that night was. So be warned before you go here, you are probably dining with rodents. I wish I could give this place no stars.",

The service was attentive but not annoying. Two of us had the naked relleno, one had flautas,  one had carnitas and another the corn chowder.  Everyone loved their meals that came out hot and nicely seasoned. Being from Colorado were really picky about our Mexican food so this was quite a treat.",

The only part of my meal that I can say was good was the chips and salsa - that is the only thing they have down. The staff was okay.  But there are so many other restaurants near here that it is going to hard to come back.  They have a great outdoor patio and location so they have the ability to thrive. My coworkers and I all felt the same way, our main entrees were awful.  All I had was a salad and soup, and I'm not sure how that can be messed up but it was.  There was not enough flavor and overall zest.  Canyon was kind supplying us with white peppermint chocolate tamales for dessert, which were quite tasty. But that is not going to be enough to win back the meal.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the food, vibe, and had the best waitress ever!  The meal starts off with a free basket of chips+salsa. The salsa was different than you would expect to get normally. It wasn't spicy, but was actually super dark red, and it was served cold, which was great! Pair it with the assortment of chips they provide, and you could easily fill yourself up! You could tell they were homemade chips--a blue tortilla, normal corn tortilla with seasoning, and then a thicker sweeter churro-esque chip (which was my favorite).  The margaritas were delicious and were pretty strong without the taste of alcohol (major plus). Maybe it's because my alcohol tolerance has decreased significantly in the past few years, but after drinking 1/3 of it, I was hit with a surprising, pleasant buzz. I got the frozen mango margarita and my friend got the frozen raspberry one.   We also ordered the table-made guac (where they have all the ingredients ready and bring it to your table side to mash it up in front of your eyes). It tasted good, just very ordinary as you would make it yourself at home. Nothing too special--wouldn't order it again.  I ordered the blackened tilapia with crawfish since it was something different than eating the normal Cajun crawfish. It had great flavors..unfortunately I was already full from the chips+salsa and guac.  All in all, the delicious food combo'd with the amazing service would have me definitely coming back on any future trip to Phoenix.",

    "text": "Was pretty impressed with the food and service during a  very large private group dinner here in January 2015. Some logistical issues are also pointed out but I'll start with the positive:  We had a set menu that included their delicious variety of chips; a generic salad starter;  a choice from 4 entrees heir seared tuna, vegetable pasta, chicken pasta or sirloin steak (not sure what the exact names are); and dessert. As a bonus they also gave us some corn husk wrapped white chocolate with nuts.  I chose the seared tuna and was floored at how good it was. Two generous tuna steaks/filets came served on top of a blend of fresh grilled bell peppers, zucchini and other seasonal veggies. The tuna was dressed in a delicious dry rub and zesty sauce, like zesty mayo or something.   Everyone else seemed happy with their food. We were quite a diverse crowd with different backgrounds and tastes so it was quite impressive to hear overall satisfaction.   A couple logistical things that were annoying was that there was some miscommunication between the kitchen and wait staff so quite a few of our guests who ordered steaks had to wait quite a while until they finally came out. I mean a long wile... like to the point of wondering if they had to go lasso, haul, and slaughter the cow. They were also out of dos equis. Also, this reservation had been made for a month or at least weeks in advance...how do you know you have a group of 45 people coming with a beer & wine allowance and not have a fully stocked selection of your beer? Or, how do you not inform your staff that it's not available so don't suggest it? Anyway, just some logistical problems that could've been better.",

For some reason they don't carry Clamato and I usually order it with a bloody mix instead which is my that great but will do.

The food is really good, especially the salsa, which is smoky and complex, and salads, which are imaginative and delicious.  The white chocolate tamales, which always arrive for free with the check, never cease to delight my guests.  Something that needs work is the chicken breast on the salads. It's usually overcooked and dry. If this were corrected I'd give them a 5.",

I ordered it rare. The peppers and zucchini were good as well. Though nothing was added to them, I guess they figured the spices of the tuna and chipotle sauce would suffice. Ripe avocados are always lovely and a good balance of the spice. The rice was good, mostly enjoyed it for the coloring...was looking forward to the \"paella\" but was rather unimpressed with the rice, it's nothing like the paella of Spain and likely came from a box.   Loved the chips!!! Yummy spice added to them and there was a great variety.",

Do this before your waitress comes.  They serve you great chips and salsa but hold off for the guacamole to come if you can as it is fantastic!  The street tacos are the hit here.  My favorite was the carnitas.  There is an option for Rice and Beans but would pass.  It's a tiny plate with a tortilla bowl in the middle with black beans. Richard surrounds it.  Looks cute but the portion is kid size.  Great location and outdoor seating is a must.  Super friendly staff but the only knock is the slow service.",

The Tex~Mex Decor was sorta fun with a small bar area near the front and a huge patio along the park side of the restaurant.     The service was a bit slow but they were very busy for lunch.  I think everyone at our table had salads, all were A~OK.  Their Cobb salad was rated the best at our table.  The Blacken steak taco salads were lacking steak and and other veggies would have been nice too in addition to just lettuce, cheese and diced pieces of steak.  The Cobb was full of everything your would expect with a good Cobb salad and was very tasty.  The Chicken taco salad was better than the steak.  The chips and salsa at first appeared to be very impressive as many other Yelpers have mentioned however your either a fan or not a fan.  I'm not a fan unfortunately...  The chips were too greasy with way too much of their seasoning!  I especially did not like their salsa.  It had no heat and HUGE chunks of tomato's! YYYEEAA~UCK.  Way too much work to get to the little bits of salsa that were actually kind of good.  I asked for a different salsa, my server just brought us some hot sauce to add to the salsa. Some of folks at our table did like their chips and salsa though. The Grand Canyon Margaritas were very good and a recommend from me to you.    Suggestion: seek out the \"Info-dude\" that walks around the Mall area to show people where to go and ask him for some coupons. We were able to get 20% off our meal coupons from him.  Based on their margaritas and a few other Yelp reviews I'm looking forward to my next visit but will order something different.",

This used to be a good restaurant, but is completely run down and the food is mediocre, at best. The chicken on the Caesar was terribly dry. The \"remoulade\" for the crab cake tasted like tartar sauce mixed with French dressing.  The mojito was made with a mix, too sweet to drink.  And the server came to our table of eight with our drinks and called each one out for us to raise our hands. Then she came out with our food and called out our dishes for us to raise our hands.  Really?  As for the atmosphere, the carpet has holes worn in it. The women's bathroom had moldy wood molding and a 3' x 3' hole in the wall covered by a black plastic trash bag taped over it.  As for the awful, old fake plants throughout the restaurant, I don't know what they are thinking.   I give the extra star for the salsa, everything else was gross.  Owners of this restaurant have no shame and no pride.  I was embarrassed to be the one who recommended my seven friends eat there.",

First, the chips & salsa that showed up as we sat down - Almost impossible to describe how good this combination of sweet, spicy, flavorful and tangy this kickoff to dinner was.  You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!  Then, dinner.  And it was fast and delicioso!  I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing.  Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!  Then we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner.  She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix.  Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special.  And then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout.  Seriously...just shoot me!  I'd give Sam's a 10 star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place.  PLUS, there's a Canyon Cafe' restaurant (parent company of Sam's) about 10 minutes from my house in St. Louis so as soon as I get back home, I'd headed there for more fun and food.  Thanks Sam's...WOW!",

I was completely unaware that he had already taken my cousins order until he brings out his meal, then he looked at me and said \"oh would you like something\" REALLY!  At this point, I was fuming inside, first of all, why didn't you ask for my order at the same time you took my cousins order this is your job and why at this point would I place an order, generally, most people go to restaurants to eat together and not separate, go figure.

As it turned our, I should have listened to my stomach. The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.  We started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.   I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.  All in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips. I may go back for drinks but will think twice, and probably even three times before I eat there again.",

I've been served by Amanda about 100 times over the last few years, and never once has she shown me poor customer service or a bad attitude.  She's about the best bartended in Phoenix, so go check her out some time!  As for the restaurant itself, the food is pretty tasty.  Pancho's enchilada's are my staple, but you can't really go wrong with anything there.  Happy Hour is also great - several good food and drink specials.  My favorite drinking place at the AZ Center by far!",

    "text": "One of our favorites.  I love that you can walk right in on a Friday or Saturday night without waiting for a table - I don't know why that is, maybe the location?  But the food has always been phenomenal.  The seared tuna and fresh veggies is so good and the portion is twice the size I've ever gotten elsewhere - so it's a great lunch the next day.  Chips and salsa are the best of anywhere.  The chips basket is a mix of white and blue corn, PLUS fried wonton wrappers with a sweet/spicy spice blend AND sweet potato chips.  Sooo good.  And it's a great, roasted salsa too.  I've had dinners, salads, quesadillas there and everything has always been good.  I'd always take my assistant there for secretaries day or for their birthdays and they always love it.  We've had out of town visitors and they always love it too.  If you love calamari, there's is great.  IT's cornmeal dusted with a spicy sauce... but there's TONS... so bring friends.  Really.  Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl.  Delish.  I LOVE that they bring you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner.  Just the perfect little two bites of sweet to finish your meal.  Consistently good food.",

    "text": "Eating outside at Sam's while birds are awake is a bad idea if you a) have sensitive ears, b) are distracted easily or c) don't like feeling like you're in the middle of a rainforest.  The birds in the trees surrounding the patio are RIDICULOUS.   Excuse me birds, I'm trying to eat.  I don't need your incessant chatter, and I also don't need you perching on nearby chairs giving me those \"look how cute I am, don't you want to give me a chip?\" moony eyes.  And since you're shouting so loud to hear each other over the water feature, it just means the paying human diners have to yell to each other even louder to be heard above everything else.  Soothing, it is not.  But if you're a mellow sort and you can let the cacophany fade into the background, you'll be stoked you found anywhere downtown that is serving food on a Sunday evening, and hey, it's early March and you're sitting outside for dinner because the temperature is in the mid 70s!  Gotta love the desert! The margaritas are glorified lemonade; I had to have 17 of them before I even started to feel a tiny bit buzzed, and even then it may have been just from wishing so hard. I had the carne asada and it was pretty good.  Flavorwise, it was quite good, although I couldn't get past the feeling that it was flavored with beef bouillon or something, to up the beef flavor.  Texturewise, if you told me I was eating mountain goat I would not have argued with you.  Note to management: sharp knives would be nice to cut through the stringy cut of meat. My server was fast and friendly, and didn't even call the Federales when I had to confess that I did not have my wallet.  Good thing online shopping has taught me to memorize my credit card number!!! Oh, and score on the chips & salsa concept: a mix of blue corn, corn, flour and. . . . sweet potato!  Hell yeah!  Only drawback was that some of the sweet potato chips weren't crunchy and had that awful chewy, oily texture of fried food gone wrong.  Who knew sweet potato chips would be good with salsa?!  Prices were great - my slab of some type of animal and onions (don't believe their promises of \"onions and peppers\" - it's mostly just onions) with black beans and rice, and a margarita all for less than $30, including tax and tip.  Not too shabby. Oh, and don't forget the white chocolate/pecan \"tamale\" they give you gratis.  It tasted just like a Jordan almond if you ask me, and even though you didn't, I just told you anyway.  Better than average mall food.",

    "text": "My two-star rating for Sam's Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour.   We went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe.   The next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out.   The third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples.   The final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more).",
