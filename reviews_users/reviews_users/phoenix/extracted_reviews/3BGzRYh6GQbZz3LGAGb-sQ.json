Those terrible ones consist of waiting for what seems like 20 minutes for your drink order to come, then another 30 for your food, all the while they're off doing who knows what. The manager is probably the most customer-friendly food service manager I've seen. If he catches wind that you're not having the best service he's there to make up for it.  Aside from that its your typical sports bar.  I was here in May 2014. You used to be able to sit yourself wherever you wanted but now they have it set up where they seat you. I guess that works for them because they're regular dining area is kind of cut off from their bar area so servers may not realize people are back there.  Food is alright. Some things aren't worth the money but it is what it is. I think its Wednesdays in which they have 50 cent wings if that's something you're interested in.",

    "text": "Great beer and decent service. That's the end of it. If you're going for happy hour I'm sure you'll be pleased. If you want food, RUN!   Gallagher's has been the only decent bar/restaurant in the area (besides Amano's, which is excellent but a bit pricey). They used to have good (not great) bar food, but apparently being the only game in the Baseline corridor has softened them. Their burgers were - were - above average. I'm very picky, if you won't serve it medium rare or less I won't bother. But they've gone waaaaay downhill. Now if I order a burger, it will either be well well done or blue rare. Horrible. So I switched to chicken since that's usually...chicken. This evening, I went for takeout, a buffalo salad (quite tasty) and a bourbon swiss chicken burger. They brought me a guacamole burger (though at least it was chicken). Can't eat tomatoes so I returned it. Thank goodness I checked it! Re-ordered the bourbon Swiss burger, received it promptly (good), took it home, sliced it in half, and beheld the pink hue before me (BAD!). It's hilarious that I can't get a medium rare burger, but I can get medium rare chicken! Of course now I'm at home so I guess my dinner is fries. Thanks, Gallagher's. Thanks.  ** I wrote that review 3 weeks ago on my phone, but reviews don't upload until you log in on an actual computer (BTW Yelp, I wish you'd change that). Anyway, tonight I was out of options, being in South Phoenix. Well, to be fair I did have fast food options (which I should have exercised, stupid me). Since I had nowhere to go but Gallagher's, I decided I would just get something deep fried and hope for the best, since it's pretty easy to make deep fried food. Silly me.   I asked for the Monterrey chicken sandwich. Again, I will note that back in the day, this used to be delicious. Now it's an overcooked (ironic, considering my issue a few weeks ago) slab of chicken on a bun. It's supposed to come with cheese, black olves, and ranch dressing. Personally, I think warm ranch dressing is really gross (as is warm mayonnaise, eww) so I asked for ranch on the side. Lo and behold, the sandwich doesn't just have ranch. the bun is literally drenched, it's soggy and disintegrating in the ranch. I'm so diappointed and angry with Gallagher's. It's my own fault for ordering food to go instead of waiting there and sending it back 10 times. Live and learn.   BTW, yes, my dinner is fries again. I hate you Gallaghers. I hate you. HATE YOU.",

I am not a picky guy or a big complainer but I need this place to improve for my own selfish reasons.    They nicely put the #1 UA bball Wildcats on one of the many flat screens, good marks there for having the PAC12 network....BUT...they wouldn't turn on the audio because a couple of other patrons sat down and we had to listen to elevator music the entire time.  I guess their policy is to only put the audio in for the NFL games but they weren't gonna start for another hour.    Burger- good Seasoned waffle fries-really good Wings-disappointing..they weren't crispy Kids menu -a lot of options but the chicken fingers were dry..the sliders were ok Service-ok...could of use more refills otherwise fine.",

I have been there for lunch, dinner, done take out and had company celebrations at this location.   The food is usually pretty good, although the last few times I've had some issues with quality.  However the service is always on point for the most part so I continue to return.  Recently I went with a friend to dinner to catch up and there was a shift change while we were there. The waitress brought one receipt when we had asked to have 2 separate receipts.  She came back and we were so engrossed in our conversation I just gave the waitress my card without looking at the receipt.  My friend paid in cash.  The next morning I saw on my account that I had paid way more than I should have.  I pulled out my receipt and saw that it had both our meals on there.  I called and talked to Mike an afternoon manager and he was very helpful and courteous.  He listened to me and took all my info including the receipt info and looked into for me.  Called me back the same afternoon and told me it would be hard putting the money back on my card, so I asked if I could just get a free salad next time I came in,  he said no problem!  Wrote my name down and I put all the info on the back of my receipt as well as proof of our conversation.  Fast forward about a week or so later, I decided I would order my salad.  I went to pick it up and the person I talked to got the manager on duty right away which I figured would be a normal procedure, no big deal.  A man introduced himself to me as Jake and I told him what happened and showed him the receipt with all the info Mike had previously given me. He made a face and said the other manager didn't know (know what?  I have no idea) He said that two people couldn't pay for the same thing because their registers would catch that (huh?) And he needed to go check the information out. I was a little annoyed at this point because I felt like he was calling me a liar and I was standing in the middle of the bar area with customers looking at me. He came back with a copy of a receipt that looked like mine but with a different waitresses name and time stamp and said my friend didn't pay for hers and I paid for both meals (how would he know that without her receipt) and that it's OK he'll pay for mine now.  Um,  I saw my friend pay her bill in cash and leave a tip. Whatever I didn't even argue. This experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  I stood there feeling like I was stealing or lying to get a $10 salad.  I won't be going back or recommending any longer.",

We had to send back the fish as it was cold, so this told us it was either frozen fish or they just don't know how to cook authentic fish and chips. We received a new order and it was okay but ate it. Offered an apology but no indication they would consider paying for the meal. Wouldn't order this again, and we also heard from some other people in the establishment someone had told them they just can't seem to figure out how to use the fryer to make fish. So if that's the case, maybe they should take it off of their menu until they figure out to use the fryer and make good fish and chips. Thank you for listening.",

We've lived nearby for about two years and find ourselves in here about once a week, sometimes more! Trivia night is so much fun (rapid fire questions during commercial breaks of whatever is on so be aware, it's not the usual question then a song or two to answer ... also it gets BUSY so be patient with the staff, they're moving as fast as they can!), karaoke night is way fun (I don't sing but the people that do are really good!!), and the drink specials are great!! The beers on tap are always fresh and cold. The food is delicious too!! I love their boneless wings when with a few people and the g mini sliders and waffle fries or Caesar wrap for dinner!!",

Unfortunately there were not enough staff to take care of the customers that did show up. After waiting far too long, had to go to the bar multiple times to order and deliver our own drinks. This was a problem a year ago and it seemed management got the message and service became very good. Don't know if this is going to continue but it does will be returning very often.",

The lights were incredibly bright there so we asked if they could be turned down like the rest of the restaurant. But they said they could not do it. I figured it was because of the betting  going on. We ordered wings and they were pretty good but for some reason when we ordered steamed vegetables we ended up with two baggies full of steamed vegetables stuffed into a small jar. Definitely not a way to serve steamed vegetables. It was borderline disgusting. Also I ordered Guinness which is typical to order on St. Patrick's Day. I got a plastic cup with my Guinness in it.",

Gallaghers was donating 20% of all food purchases to the rescue. My friends and I had a very positive experience, and will gladly go back if given another reason. That being said, there were a couple of things I feel compelled to point out. When serving drinks, small bar napkins would be nice. I squeezed the lime into my drink, and then had nowhere to wipe my fingers. Putting side vegetables in a little cup reminds people of middle school cafeteria food. Bar nachos should never have convenience store cheese sauce on them. If you're a bar, check on drink status please? When charging extra for celery, either mention it beforehand, or at least give more than a stalk and a half.  The positives? The Tilapia was cooked PERFECTLY. Their margaritas aren't from a gross mix! The mozzarella sticks were shockingly good. My Bloody Mary was delicious. And, did I mention that the staff was very nice?",

This is the typical neighborhood watering hole, complete with a mediocre beer selection and uninspiring menu.  The food is OK, but what I don't like about this place is that when I ordered a salad they brought out a very small ramekin of dressing.  Then they had the audacity to charge for more.  The manager even had the gall to suggest they made their own dressing.  I'm calling BS!  I've worked in kitchens, including fine dining, and this was your typical Sysco product.  The ONLY reason I'd go back to this restaurant is if a large group I was part of wanted to go despite my objections.",

The only reason why I did not give this place a 5 star is because when ordering drinks, they were completely out of what I normally drink, which would have made Happy Hour greater. Since they did not have my drink, I ended up having to order something much more expensive.  I believe that you should never run out of a beverage that you have on the happy list.  Nevertheless, I love the fact that you can sit inside or outside.  I can't wait to try the other food on the menu, but I may have to stick with the draft beer during happy hour instead of ordering my normal alcohol drink.",

Was a bit surprised when ordered 2 beers at the bar when we arrived- $6/ea for a Modelo, and they charged tax on the beers too - so 2 beers were $13.00 - just seems like more than average cost we are used to paying. I guess those tvs above the urinals need to get paid for somehow.  Had fun, will return, a cheap ride with Uber helps.",

We had someone come right away for drinks but then can never really tell who our server is and it takes a bit to order.   Last time we ordered an app and 2 entrees and got the app after the entrees - which sucked because we ended up having too much food. Large portions, food is good for bar food. Didn't like the chicken tenders, but had good wings and a wrap. Have a large menu and seem to have decent specials.   Sadly we live in south Phoenix and thus will probably continue to come because it's the close sports bar with the best draft list. Lots of Four Peaks and other crafts.",

I asked what of three sandwiches would be best today, Philly, Reuben, or french dip. It was suggested that the Reuben. Only half good. The meat was bland as it was held in a water bath to keep warm and its texture was weak. The bread was so so and french fries average. I won't be back.

We were afraid it wouldn't be enough food, but the servings we decent sized, and we STILL couldn't finish them. No reason to eat more than to have something in your belly, because the food isn't good enough to finish. Reminds me of the pre-packaged stuff you get warmed up at event venues, or amusement parks. Fatty, over-salted, and with wilted veggies.   I also question how clean everything is...the appetizer plates and tortilla warmers were covered in greasy smears and fingerprints. And the plates were recently \"washed\".  I would come back for a happy-hour beer, but nothing more...",

She had a Swiss cheese burger with mushrooms - I had the beef sandwich with onions and peppers - as we tried to eat she said she needed ketchup - I needed something to ease it down - they were both very dry. She got ketchup and I got the French dip sauce. The Mgr came buy so i let him know the food was quite dry - he said he appreciated it because no one likes dry meat ( his words). I got the bill and saw that the dipping sauce was added to the bill and the marg was still on. I asked about the drink and the polite waitress came back with that removed.

On our first night, we wanted to watch the Sharks game but they don't have the channel on their dish. Oh well. For dinner, I had the sesame chicken salad and a Loaded Baker, which is a baked potato with sour cream, butter, diced bacon, cheddar cheese and diced green onions. Both were satisfying. I forgot what my friends got, but both liked what they had. Since we came during happy hour, you pay $2.50 for large domestic drafts, so the Coors Lights came to our table in waves. Then we found out that it was Trivia Night, which we were excited about. AND WE WON! We beat another table by 1 question (What president preceded Andrew Johnson?) and the answer was just guess (Abe Lincoln). LOL The prize was a $50 gift certificate which we used for our bill.  We came here again the next day and got the $2.50 large Coors Lights and the $2.95 boneless wings. My friend and I split an order of twelve because he likes his wings spicy and I don't. I wanted mine with honey bbq. They messed up the order (all 12 were spicy) and gave me six with no extra charge. We did have dinner here again and once again, I thought the food (Southwestern burger) was great. If you stay long again, you can catch reverse happy hour.  Also if you like horse or dog track racing, you can place your bets here. They have dedicated tv screens for that. Those dogs look so sad though.",

The queso dip was very runny and the chicken was dry on the sliders.  Our waitress barley checked on us, but as soon as she dropped off the check she was back at our table within minutes to cash us out.  I am actually surprised I came back after the owner yelled at me the last time when I asked to watch the Tigers baseball game, he yelled in front of everyone \"what is her problem\"  um is that anyway to treat your customers?  I think the owners just need to sell it to someone that is going to care about the quality of food they serve.

As a manager of commercial real estate, we encourage all businesses to have employees park in spaces of least desire to the patrons.  Here in AZ, we all seek parking spaces that are shaded during these summer months.  We located a few behind the building and there were NO PARKING RESTRICTIONS posted.  It happened that this day about 3:00 pm, we were asked not to park in these spaces as they were reserved for employees.  When we asked where the signs were, he admitted there weren't any but, insisted we park elsewhere.  We did, at another venue.  My only point is that when the self proclaimed GM feels customers are not as important as the employees, we all felt it was not the place we wanted to visit.  Instead another venue received our couple of hundred dollars.",

When she did come back to take our order ( waived her down to come take it) I asked again about HH- oh yeah, let me get you a HH menu. OMG- another 10 mins for her to come back. Service throughout the night was bad- OH, we ordered an appetizer and after 20 mins nothing so I waved her down AGAIN, she sat \"you haven't gotten it yet?\"  When she came back she claimed the cooks burned the first one and had to make another. The new one was barely warm- my guess, it sat back there under the heating lamp.  We will NOT be back- will drive the miles into chandler for better service.",

If you're looking for innovative, local, trendy restaurants, look elsewhere. If you live close and want a no frills bite to eat and a beer, go here. The wine selection sucks but it's cheap. The service is also not terrible. It's a busy bar and they do a good job to check on everyone every once in a while. There's also a side of the restaurant that is booths if you don't want to sit in the bar area.   My husband loves wings, and they were happy to accommodate him with four wings of each type of wing sauce so he could sample the ones that sounded the best to him.   I have no complaints about Gallaghers. It's not nearly as bad as all of the reviews below. It's just a neighborhood bar with food and tvs. Good for either hanging out with friends or takeout. Give this place a break people!",

I like to frequent the local restaurants because I want to do my part to keep them in business.   That being said, I'm moving on.    The new menu for dinner is a complete disappointment.    Gone are the best food items they had, and everything has been replaced with basic bar food.  We decided to truly the pulled pork sandwich and a Cubano, and I can honestly say they are no longer even competition for Applebee's.     I can only hope that a new restaurant comes into the neighborhood so I don't have to travel to Tempe for a decent meal.",

    "text": "Mid August I hosted by husband's birthday happy hour at Gallagher's. Things we great in the beginning. Our reserved table was ready and waiting for us and we had two wait staff moving throughout our group. I was very pleased with my decision to hold it there. As the evening wore on we rarely had service and our guests were ordering from both the happy hour menu and the regular menu; they would have earned quite a nice tip if the service hadn't fallen off. For about our last hour and a half we had to beg for service. We'd flag a waiter down to order then have to beg 30 minutes later to get what we ordered. It was embarrassing for my guests to be treated like this.  When we were ready to go we had go find a waitress to ask for the bill (even though most of the party had departed because they were tired of waiting); that took a while to get. Once we had the bill my father-in-law pointed out to me a gratuity was included in the bill because the size of the party and that was fine. I wasn't please with the service but I still would have left a tip. We put the cash in the bill folder that had been left by departed guests, my father-in-law and I added our credit cards, and then asked the waitress (when she eventually came by again) to deduct the cash and split the bill in two.   When we got our slips to sign my father-in-law told me not to add a gratuity because he would add more even though there was an included gratuity. I wrote 0 in the tip and wrote the total on the total line.  Fast forward to me doing bills... someone at Gallagher's decided to add their own additional $15 tip on my receipt. This is NOT okay! I realize a big party is tough but the service was terrible and they had already included and included gratuity and my father-in-law added more.   Even though it is a convenient location with decent bar food I WILL NOT GO BACK!",

It had been a few months since we came in and the menus have changed. We started with the chips and guacamole. Guacamole is pretty hard to screw up, but they managed to do it. Completely bland. Just avocado and tomato. No cilantro. No onion. No Serrano peppers. No garlic. No lime juice. No salt and pepper. So disappointing.   I ordered the green Chile Mac and cheese. Again - completely bland. Cheese sauce bland and not enough green chiles. Had to salt and pepper the crap out of it.   My husband got the Philly Cheesesteak. Again, completely bland. He didn't even finish  his plate.   It was pretty dead for a Saturday night and our waiter was terrible. We waited over 15 min to order our food and it only happened when I walked up to the bartender and complained that we hadn't seen our waiter. When he finally showed up, it seemed like we were an inconvenience and interrupting his night. All I can think is that they got a new cook and management has no taste buds or eyes to see what's going on.   We'll probably give it one more shot but if things aren't better I can't imagine we'll be back.",

The wait staff is generally pretty attentive, although I have been in there where the wait time is excessive and it is hard to get service in a timely manner.  Perhaps the evening hours provide a more lively atmosphere, but for lunchtime content, it gets an average score.",

We sat at the bar and I immediately got a whiff of the tuna sandwich special. Eww nasty. We were helped right away by the bartender and were happy to see that the HH lasted from 11am to 7pm so we ordered a beer. Four Peaks IPA for me and Blue Moon for my man...ice cold and good. The beer exceeded my expectations...I love IPA. Ordered a burger, the blue cheese and bacon one, substituted turkey burger and got a side of veggies...my bf got the regular burger with cheese. It didn't take long but once the food came out that's when the disappointment sent in. The bun...the most important part of a burger aside from the actual meat was awful. It was dry and came apart immediately. Not just mine, but also his...tried to put mayo to tack it back together but it didn't help and the steamed veggies (my attempt to be slightly healthy) were cold and not completely cooked. I would think it would be hard to mess those up but they did and they were. All in all, the beer was good. Probably not going to go back, I can get a good IPA at Four Peaks instead.",

I don't like sports, and 2. they aren't usually very veggie friendly, unless you like salad, which I don't. Gallagher's though, serves up a pretty good veggie burger. You've got a couple of options when ordering - you can either build your own Gallaburger (B.Y.O.G.), or order one of the other burger options and just substitute the veggie patty. There are quite a few to choose from, some better than others, some actually pretty fucking good, like the Baja Burger with jalapeno jack cheese, sliced avocado and fresh salsa (I think this one comes with bacon by default, but from my experience, they're very receptive to mixing and matching, which is nice). Or the Maui Burger with swiss cheese, teriyaki sauce and pineapple salsa.",

All accomodations have been made, when I have special requests like extra cheese or extra pickles on my veggie burger.  The service has always been prompt and wonderful in my visits.  It's always busy here, it seems, but that never seems to slow down the food making its way to our table.  It takes long enough for me to know it's being cooked to order, but it's fast enough to make it to my mouth before any complaints have made it out.  ;o)",

    "text": "I haven't been here in a while and tonight decided to drop in as I was craving a burger and a beer. The indoor bar area was full so I went and sat at the outdoor bar. I sat for 15 minutes and a server or bar tender never came outside. There were other patrons out there that had food and drinks so I wasn't alone. I got tired of waiting and went and sat in the off track betting area. The sign at the front had read 'seat yourself' so I didn't feel the need to go inform a hostess where I was sitting. Once again the section was totally ignored for around 15 minutes. At this point I was pissed off and didn't want to give them my service this evening. For that I can't rate any higher than 1 star since I wasn't even acknowledged. It'll probably be a while before I go back again. South Phoenix is in desperate need of another sports bar to compete with this place.",

Everything is processed, as are most food establishments, but the chicken seems like it was taken out of a bag, microwaved and served. My coworkers seem to like the fish 'n chips, which I have yet to try. The fries are alright, nothing spectacular. I guess it would be a fun place though just to relax at lunch or after work - it's a sports grill, but the food just isn't up there with me.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch and ordered a salad with steak on it.  The steak was blah and there was hardley any of it on the salad.  I took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  So I ordered the chicken cesear salad...that was the most bland salad I've ever had. You know how there's supposed to be that slight twang of lemon there was none.  The chicken was so bland and chewy it was very difficult to eat.  There was no seasoning on the chicken whatsoever.  I'm thinking it was some left over chicken from somewhere.  Needless to say I left there hungry.    My lesson learned...when you go to a bar, order bar food.  You should have better luck with the wings.",

    "text": "After reading some dicey reviews on various sites, I was a little hesitant to try this place.  I was very happy I did.  The first, not so surprising, find was the extensive beer list.  Gallagher's has more than 20 micro brews plus a host of major labels.  I quickly found a nice dark that was to my liking and then started looking for a dinner entree. I quickly found a smoked meat plate that sounded excellent.  The two meats that I chose were turkey and corned beef.  I'd never had smoked corned beef before, but I love it and it sounded delicious.  Since it was a busy friday night, I was curious to see how quick the order would show up.  I was pleasantly surprised to get my meal quite quick, even though the ample number of televisions and NTN trivia were keeping entertained.  The smoked meats were all deli sliced thin like sandwich meat, which had me skeptical. However, that's where the doubts ended.  The meats were juicy and wonderfully smokey in flavor.  The smoked corned beef was divine and the turkey wasn't a bit dry despite being thin sliced.  The mixed vegetables were a surprising al dente, delicious and fresh tasting, which is something you don't typically find in your neighborhood pub.  All in all, a very satisfying meal at a decent price.  Even with a lot of possible reasons for things to go wrong, I was pleasantly surprised that Gallagher's delivered much more so than I would expect from your average neighborhood pub.  Good food that went well beyond your average pub fare with quick service and a friendly atmosphere.",

My biggest problem with this bar is that despite the karaoke bringing an interesting crowd, there was a huge brawl out front and we had to be locked inside the restaurant until the police came and made an arrest.  The male in the fight had beaten a female so bad that she was immediately taken to the hospital by an ambulance.    Lesson learned--even though this bar is in a decent area, females...do NOT go there alone! (the female apparently did not know the guy)",

    "text": "In our six months living in South Phoenix, my husband and I avoided this place, thinking that it would just be another Applebee's, Chili's, Native New Yorker - you know, a chain with typical, bland American food. We finally decided to check it out last Wednesday night (our night for a mid-week outing) and were pleasantly surprised.   We sat out on the covered patio, which is really nice. It's really spacious, has two sections (one with low tables and one with high tables), features three huge flat screens, and has plenty of misters. You can also smoke on the patio, since the entrance to the restaurant is around the other side.   Our server greeted us promptly and was very friendly. To drink, we ordered vodka sodas, which were priced very well at $2.75 a pop! We noticed that on the menu they feature tons of different burger preparations/styles and let you choose your patty type (between an Angus patty, Kobe patty (for $3 more), a chicken breast, turkey burger, and a veggie patty) and your bread type (ciabatta, sesame bun, multigrain bun, sourdough, multigrain bread, rye, and bed of lettuce, which is nice for those watching their carb intake!). We had heard good things about their veggie burger, so we got the Southwestern style burger with the veggie patty. We also got the seasoned fries and a dozen hot honey BBQ wings (which are $.40 each on Wednesdays).   All in all, we were really impressed with the food. The veggie burger was among the best I've had, the fries were crispy and not too greasy, and the wings were flavorful with a nice kick of spice. We also only spent $30 or so for all of the food and three drinks.   This is a great spot for some mid-week relaxation, cheap drinks, and solid food. With the weather as nice as it is right now, the patio is also a great feature. We will most definitely return.",

The meat plate sounded good, we ordered chicken breast in bourbon sauce and pulled pork. The chicken was good, tender, juicy and had great flavor. The pulled pork was served dry and had a weird taste to it, like rubber.. Even with tons of BBQ sauce it was still dry. The corn on the cob was mushy and the salad was wilted. Bad meal overall, but good service and icy cold blue moon.",

    "text": "Visited for lunch today, my first time at G's.  Since I already checked out the menus online, I was ready with the first of many questions regarding my numerous food allergies to ask my server as soon as he walked up to my table- Yes, I'll have iced water, please.  Oh, and could you find out if your bbq sauce contains ...?  (Some don't, you know.)  Next thing I knew, Liz the manager was at my side.  After mentally jotting down which of the \"major\" allergens I was most worried about, she disappeared into the kitchen to do some research: are the sauces safe?  is the cod fresh or frozen, and is the batter *-free?  the fish is def. not frozen, but she'll check re * ingredients... are the breads made in-house?  (home-made reduces the chance of * usage.)    and the verdicts?  lay off all the sauces, just to be sure; not sure on the batter, so stay away.  breads are made locally, and she didn't have any ingredients info.  and with all of that data, i pretty much had most of the menu items crossed off (sandwiches/burgers that contained buns and sauces, entrees that used sauces (award-winning ribs, entrees adorned with sauces,  marinated meats, etc.), fried fish, anything battered.  this left the wraps (well, those that did not use *, sauces, etc.) and the sweet potato fries.  Ah, the SPF!  What was I thinking, laying off of the raspberry mayo for the first half?  This sauce brought the greatness of the fries to a new crescendo.  I REALLY love crispy/crunchy textures (probably due to my compulsion to be healthy and stay away from deep-fried anything most of the time.  Plus, grease-flavored foods really don't rock my boat.  Oh, but these SPF's with the razz mayo were really good.    The meat wrap, $7.95.  With beef tenderloin, $8.95.  Comes with choice of side.  Other sides not listed may require an upcharge- most likely with my SPF.  My beef wrap looked quite appetizing- thin slices of beef tenderloin with SW rice and shredded cheese wrapped in a chipotle tortilla, with shredded salad mix and salsa with sour cream drizzle on the side.  Took a bite.  Mmm... very tasty, but wha?  Is that * in the SW rice?!?!  For the rest of the meal, I was picking * off.  What I really should've done was return the wrap and get one sans rice, since the * juice would be all over the rice.  But the first one took so long to reach my table- I had eaten all but five sticks of the fries- that the option didn't even enter my thoughts.  The fries cost an extra $3 bec. I was served the app portion.  Whatever.  I'm also thinking that the chipotle wrap had * in it.  (I was in pain for the rest of the day, and still am, twelve hours later.)  Yes, I was disappointed, but I can't say all of those minutes chatting with the manager were for naught.  I just wished she and especially the staff were more knowledgeable of all of their dishes and sides.  I'll return for the sweet potato fries and razz mayo.  And maybe a delectable icy beverage.  Anyone know how the margaritas, pina coladas (haven't had one of those in years!), and daquiris are here??    Inside atmosphere (standard booths and rectangular bar tables and chairs with TVs everywhere you look up- like a cafeteria) is a striking contrast to the lazy Sunday, who-knows-who's-coming-to-dinner vibe (bossa nova music was playing in the background) I felt outside as I walked past to get indoors.  One problem- I just can't stand inhaling cigarette smoke while I'm eating.  I can't stand inhaling tobacco smoke anywhere, anytime, actually.  I hope I didn't offend anyone just now... For some people it may be flatus or body odor that offends them; for me, it's smoke.  Unless it's a clove.  Love that spicy scent.  (Body odor offends me, too.  But I digress...)  Anyhoo, for all you sweet potato fry lovers out there, try them here.  You'll thank me later.",

The food was decent.  I had the chicken, potatoes, fries, and garlic bread.  The bread was different and pretty good (compared to anything on the east coast).  The fries were run-of-the-mill seasoned curly fries, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The best part about this place was, in my mind, the waitresses. Whoever the hiring manager is must have been a former manager for Hooter's, if you know what I mean.   With that said, i'd go here for the plethora of flat-screens and atmosphere, not really the food.",

We might as well have been invisible. No one even acknowledged us for the first 10 minutes. When the server finally came to our table, she hardly knew anything about the drink menu or the food menu. It said 'taco Tuesday' on one of the lists at our table, with no explanation as to what that meant. Turns out you get 3 tacos for some reduced rate. Can you have one of each kind?\" The server didn't know. We ordered drinks while waiting for her to find out. Fully 10 minutes later she brought water to my mom, but no drinks to us. We had just about decided to have our drinks and just go without dinner when she finally brought our drinks and took our food order. The drinks were expensive and definitely nothing special. Twenty minutes later our food came. The only reason I've given two stars is the food was really good. My sister and I split the broiled fish which was delicious. We also split the sweet potato fries which were crispy on the outside and still creamy on the inside. Mom really liked her Rueben sandwich too and took 1/2 of it home.  We all agreed we won't be wasting our time going to this place again.",

Green Bay for a year and understand I won't get that kind of goodness here. These curds however were the least tasty I have had in the valley. I also ordered a desert dog. Wrapped in bacon, cheese, peppers, jalapenos and more. Their version of the classic Sonora dog. I'll try that. At first glance, I was suspicious. The dog wasn't wrapped in bacon. The bacon was laid along side the dog. I also wasn't a fan of the bun. More like a roll used for Italian beef sandwiches. The flavor of the dog was really pretty tasty though. I would have been perfectly happy with a plain dog.  Next time, if I want more than a beer, I'll stick to the wings.",

    "text": "I'd really like to give this Gallagher's a 3.5  since things were as expected and a bit more.   I met friends here for an after work drink and a lite meal. Based on mixed reviews by other Yelpers, I was a bit skeptical about how this place would be in both service and food.  Parking was easy as there is a lot in front with other businesses. When I arrived a bit after 4:30, there were a few customers and it wasn't busy at all. I grabbed a seat and was quickly asked what I wanted to drink. The server brought my water quickly and was friendly.  My friends arrived within a few minutes and they too were asked for their drink order right away.  It took us a bit to get through the menu as we were chatting, but our server didn't seem to mind. We didn't feel rushed at all. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad with the fried chicken (medium sauce) and ranch dressing on the side. Right now I wish I would have ordered the wings since the chicken in the salad was so, so yummy. The salad was fresh and pretty good. Our orders were perfect with no mistakes or issues. Our server checked on us several times but wasn't intrusive to our conversation at all.   There are two things that bugged me a little. One, the server split our check in three without asking us. My friend's dish was not as expensive as ours so I didn't think that was \"fair.\" We split it in thirds anyway since my friend is classy that way. Second, every once in a while smoke wafted into the restaurant from the patio. Be careful when you select your seat or ask to be moved if smoke really bothers you.   Bathrooms are clean as is the establishment overall.   Overall, a solid rating. I noticed lots of TVs so this would be a good place to watch sporting events. I would definitely go back if in the area.",

The best meal was their chicken taco salad...really delicious.   The atmosphere is OK; they have a lot of TVs all about even the outdoor patio. I think it would be difficult to watch NFL Sunday games there; the place is not large enough to have the sound going for each game without it' simply being noisy and can't hear your game.

We would have stayed longer, and probably doubled our bill, except for a very loud, annoying table behind us that kept yelling and clapping. (sunday football games were on the multiple TVs)  I understand fan's excitement, we were there to watch football , just like most of the other customers, but this particular table could be heard all through the place.  They made the experience so bad that we left and went to another establishment to watch the rest of the game and have a few drinks. Service was OK at best.

The menu has tons of different options, there are plenty of tv's, & the patio is cool with the art & waterfall. The service has never been good, but today was exceptionally poor.   We arrived as the same time as a bicycling group after completing a race & grabbed a patio table. We were the only people on the patio not from the race. We waited 5 minutes & didn't even SEE a server. I went inside to get a drink & waited another 5 minutes to even be acknowledged by bartender (even though there was only 1 other person at the bar). I asked for 2 beers & she refused to serve me without seeing IDs & my boyfriend was still outside. Ok fine- I understand & comply with the law- but when I expressed frustration that there were no servers outside, she was curt back to me saying there were 3 & I had to be patient. No. You knew this group was coming & failed to adequately staff your restaurant. Your problem, not mine. As a paying return customer I did not appreciate her attitude. It still took 12 minutes to get our drinks & service continued to be poor. I never received the water or toast I asked for- and the manager was beyond annoying when I ordered the toast so maybe it's a good thing I never received it.  Read the reviews & visit at your own risk.",

    "text": "In a couple dozen visits, I have had acceptable service only twice at this place and the employee that provided it both times doesn't work there anymore.  I go because it's a sportsbar with lots of tvs that's close to my house.  The food would be good if served quickly, but that rarely happens.  In fact, this place would probably get four stars for the food, beer selection & tvs, except that the service is just so rediculously bad, it ruins everything.  EVERYTHING.  Maybe someone from Gallaghers will read this, fire everyone on the wait staff, and then start over.   I hate people that tell isolated stories about their one experience with shitty service at a restaurant and make it all one sided like they are not ass holes, but I have this great story I gotta tell about this place and yes I hate myself for it so fuck off.    I got a table with a buddy once outside (we were seated by the hostess) and got passed up by a server for 20 minutes of staring them in the face as they walked by, and then i tried waving my arms around when it appeared one of them was looking in my general direction (which did not work), then my buddy actually got up and snagged one of them, who promised she would be right back.  10 minutes after that I went to the bar & ordered a couple of beers for us.  The bartender acknowledges my beer order and, at that moment, a waitress comes in from outside and tells the bartender that she just doesn't have time for table #xx outside and if he could go get their order that would be great.  So I watch him forget about me and walk out to MY TABLE, talk to my buddy, then walk back in and pour us a couple of beers.    I decided not to say anything because I was actually laughing at this point. Bartender tries to flag down the waitress to give her the beers to take out to the table, but she kept ignoring HIM!   Yes the bartender was unable to get the waitress' attention after he did her a favor.  So, finally she's in the little computer area behind the bar (I'm still just standing there being entertained), and shes keying in some order from somebody, and the bartender walks over to her and says \"I have your two beers for that outside table\".  She says \"what outside table?\"  Bartender: \"The one you asked me to get the order from\"  Waitress:  \"Well take the fucking beers out to the table then\"  Bartender:  \"But that's your table.  I have other customers at the bar\"  Waitress:  \"Then fucking give the beers to somebody at the bar.  Or drink them yourself.  I don't care, I just don't have time for this shit\"  This is so great right!   So the bartender just stands there and looks at the waitress, who has her back to him and then, resigned, he walks back behind the bar, picks up the beers and takes them out to our table.  He comes back in, and asks me again what I wanted (because he forgot all about me), and I order a couple more beers because I know that I probably won't get served for the rest of the night.  So now we've got four beers.   Bartender agrees to \"put them on my tab\".  Over the course of the next 30 minutes with zero visits from the waitress, we work our way through those while shooting the shit.   As we're about finished, the waitress actually has the gonads to come up to our table all sweet and nice, and ask us if we'd like anything else.  No.  She puts the tab (for four beers, so she knows or should know that I went in to the bar to get beers at some point) on our table with a little heart on it and then goes into this whole story about how sorry she is and that the bar has just been sooooo busy and it's somebody elses fault bla bla bla bla.  Thank you.  No tip.  In fact I would take money away from you if I could lady.    Wow that was long and the finish wasn't as good as I remembered.  Oh well.   Go to Native New Yorker instead.",

Place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like I did on a previous visit. In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail. Great service on a saturday afternoon and reasonable prices ($8.99) for a filling lunch.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, and I will continue to go (due to lack of other sports bar options in the area), but this place just is not that great though it has the potential.    The few times I have been there, there have always been problems with the food - and I mean service issues, not quality issues - which leads me to believe the management could use a little makeover.  I have had cold wings served (I mean cold, not just not hot).  Wings take over 30 minutes (at which point they were canceled).  The food is fairly decent though, for bar food.  Nothing I crave, but something that will get me by during a big game.  Last night I went in to watch the ASU/UA football game and they had the sound on for the Cleveland/Heat game.  Really??  Do you know what state your bar is in?  Did you happen to notice that half the people there were wearing ASU or UA gear?  Apparently the manager wanted to hear the starting lineup.  I can kind of get that - I had curiosity around the game too - but if you want to see that, then tune into Sportscenter AFTER the ASU/UA game.  After the starting lineup was announced, and about 15 minutes in the football game, they changed the sound which was greeted by loud applause in the bar.  Little things like that make me believe the management is not in tune with the wants of their patrons.  They do have PLENTY of TV's to watch games and accommodate requests for game changes.",

The manager basically lectured me on how they 'smoke' their wings. I was irritated by his approach, i told the manager i always dine at this location and never had a problem. The manager just seemed like he wanted to just argue and justify my order.  It was definitely my last visit here.",

I have been coming to this place for over four years and have never encountered raw food or  baby roaches.  The waitress immediately took the food back and had to cooks put them back in the oven and called the manager, who by the way was not on the premises at all.  When she was finally about to get in touch with him, he did show up.  He shows up in shorts and a t-shirt like he doesn't have a care on the world.  Now I'm willing to accept that it may be his day off so maybe he just came in to resolve the issue.  What I don't like is when anyone tries to undermine my intelligence like he did.  I cook and smoke various meats all the time and I know what raw or undercooked chicken looks like.  When they brought the wings back out after putting them back in the oven, they still were not cooked fully.  To tell me that they cook the wings for three hours before they are served and then they cooked them again to order before they give them to customers is ABSOLUTELY crap.  To not even address the the fact that there was a baby roach on one of the plates was even worse.  Then you has the audacity to charge us for them.  I am so disappointed in the fact that this is the type of manager that apparently  thinks that this is ok.  I would like to say that the other food was great but I will never go here again.  I never have had this type of service from this site before and best believe I will not ever again, can you say food inspectors and board of health need to drop by soon!!!",

Mind you, there is hardly anyone in this place.  She disappeared in the back and I didn't get my drink until about 12 minutes later. I saw it, my drink had been sitting there waiting to get served for quite a while. Pretty pathetic. That drink done, it just sat there empty for quite a while in plain view.  She went by to other tables but didn't even bother to ask if I needed something else, much less to take my order for food.    After quite a while a manager comes up.  You need anything? Looked him square in the eye and told him you have terrible service here. I didn't ask for a manager, don't know why he came to my table, but he took responsibility for it right off and he went to bat.  Was there every 5 minutes.  I'll give him kudos for that and it made the experience not too shabby.  Still, that waitress........",

It is more busy in the evening and has a laid back feel.  The dining room is big and much more quiet. It is much darker than the bar area. It is usually pretty empty in there. Wait staff is a little less attentive since they seem pretty busy in the other seating areas.  They do karaoke one night a week in the bar area. Honestly, the crowd doesn't seem very interested. The hostess sang more than anyone else and the songs are dated.  Overall, I like the place. It is a good place to hang out.",

I've been coming here for a while and have never had any problems. Lindsay has always real and gives me great service, definitely recommend this spot!",

No big deal.  But when 2 people in the party are forgotten completely and no effort is made to make them happy, that is a big deal. The manager even came out and asked if everything was fine, and when we pointed out 2 people were missing their meals, the manager said \"I'll go check on that\" and was not seen again for the rest of the evening.  The food itself was fine, but there's no much the kitchen can do when they don't receive the order.  The next day one of the party checked her statement and found she had been charged for 2 different bills. When she called to get it corrected, the manager told her \"oh, they rang you up wrong but I told the waiter to let you know we reversed the charge.\" No responsibility taken.   Next time the office has a reason to celebrate, we know this is not the place.",

    "text": "I've stopped in Gallagher's a time or two in the past year.  What a nice sports bar.  Tons of TVs all around.  The outside patio is always packed and a lot of TVs out there too.  I absolutely think this is a fantastic place to go watch a game.    I wouldn't go here if you're looking for anything that resembles fine dining.  This is strictly bar food.  There's nothing exciting to mention about the food at all and I've pretty much stopped eating there and will only have a drink when I go there with the occasional order of fries.  I like their martini menu.  They have these cute sweet martini's for 6 bucks.  They also have 4 Peaks Kiltlifter on tap and some other local beers.  What makes me come back from time to time on Saturday nights?  The karaoke.  There is a little lady that comes on Saturdays who wears her cowboy hat and sings her country music.  Then, there's me.  The country loving black girl with the big curly afro who gets up and murders a Gretchen Wilson song!  Oh, just murder the song.  Poor song has died a million deaths at my hand, I'm sure.  If you are on that side of town, perhaps staying at the Legacy down the street, you will find that this place is AWESOME for catching a game while you're in town on vacation.  50% of the times I've gone here was a game night and the place was packed with people, particularly that patio and the bar.  Great for a late night drink too.",

It is tough to have a conversation with a friend. The building is not acoustically sound. They have plenty of televisions but the sound is never on. They're always playing rock music when I've been there",

When I come, I sit in the dinning area (located on the other side of the bar) service is wonderful (Thank you, Jennifer) food is nice and hot and even looks freshly cooked and sent right out. Maybe tips are better LOL. Will I be back? Yes, where would I be seating myself? Take a guess ;)",
