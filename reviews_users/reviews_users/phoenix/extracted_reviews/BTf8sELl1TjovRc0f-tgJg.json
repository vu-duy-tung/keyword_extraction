    "text": "I have come here for football games on Sunday and my problem is that they don't have enough or for that matter any football specials on food. They have what they always have on Sunday which is all you can eat lousy pizza for $8. They need to have a football menu and another beef is that 3/4 of their appetizers are more expensive than some entrees and sandwiches. The pizza bread junk that we ordered was a dollar more than a turkey sandwich with fries. Oh and that forementioned pizza bread was horrible, literally the chef just cut up one of their junky thin crust pizza's and served it on a plate with marinara sauce. Nothing like the menu description - would have returned it, but shift change left the place devoid of servers right after 1pm football games ended. THey do have a good selection of beers, but the only sunday special is flat glasses of lite beer for $2 which was returned. Also, on this day a tree company (on sunday) was cutting trees on property producing a loud buzzing sound for about an hour. Who cuts trees on Sunday? Service is great though, but be creative with your menu because there are like 100 places that show football around here and most have specials that make the joint worth going to at least.",

    "text": "Q: The best selection of beers on tap? A: Boulder's.              I resisted this place for as long as I could, pedaling past it furiously, thinking \"God, that place looks like it SUCKS\", always opting for PV. But then... like one day I finally noticed the giant stencil of a bicycle painted near the door. I could hear the chords from \"The Neverending Story\" everytime they showed the serpent symbol. I was curious. Then one night I noticed some skinny guys in flannel shirts, black frames laughing and casually pulling their bicycles INSIDE of Boulders.          My roommates were meeting up some friends at Boulder's and I just had to join them. I walked in to see a gigantic space, really pretty overwhelming. They recently added a beam to the bicycle space so you can hang your bike up (I have a heavy old vintage frame so I park poor Charley against the wall), and you get overwhelmed by the space: 1) There are roomes located down the stairs to your left. Unless it is very busy and a lot of servers, you will be not noticed down there-tons of booths and lights, like an old western Pizza Hut 2) Up the stairs is kind of a low roof-ceilinged room with long tables perfect for big groups of friends eating pizza, drinking beer (once again, clear it with the wait staff) and on the other side a pool table you can overlook the bar crowd like a lil patio 3) the main room down the stairs where the bar is with rows of high tables that spill out down another pair of stairs to another pool table and more booths.  We usually just pick a table right behind the bar if possible so you get fast service-but we love the wait staff here and they are always willing to give a sample, talk about the beer, discuss the specials in details, etc.  Now, regarding the decor-it is weird. It is like a ski lodge/pizza hut/old cabin sports bar, etc. It is just a fish out of water here in Tempe. But don't hold the decor against it (think about how many people ever go inside of Casey Moore's and how dank and ground round-ish and kinda gross it is inside), since for all you supposed beer snobs, it really is more about the beer.  The beer. OMG. I was stunned when I first came here-you mean you specialize in DogFishHead seasonal drafts? Great White? Shark Attack? Fat Tire and Sam Adams seasonals? I mean, I can't even begin to tell you about the beers b/c there are too many to talk about! And that isn't including bottles and cans they have and rotate frequently. Come here once a week and you are guaranteed a new beer on tap to try. In fact, coming here made me less of a fan of Casey's! I realized how much that bar is coasting by on reputation and smokers on the patio b/c their mixed drinks are weak, their food is pricey for what it is, and they never have any good specials on their boring beer on tap! Here, they have happy hour and reverse happy hour specials, and a different meal deal every night of the week!  Plus, I can never have that much bar food anyway, but I do like their Bar Stuff platter w/fried zucchini, onion rings, mozz stix, etc. And their pizza really is good! Like they have this one with avocado, bacon and french onion rings, omg it is the bomb-and their plan pizza is good too. The guys like the sandwiches, but I never really come here for dinner, more like a late weekday night beer and snack, relax with friends, and pedal back home.  On weekends it is becoming packed, but stop by here a late Tuesday and check it out.  Oh, and yes, sometimes people play terrible music on the jukebox-but that is b/c this is a real person bar, not a hipster bar (yet), and they like some shitty music, okay? And it is an internet jukebox, not a cool one like at Shady's-but sometimes someone plays Snoop's \"Sensual Seduction\" and it just feels right, okay?  \"Gonna take my time, tyyyyyiiimmee\"",

The big freaking nacho is very interesting and good. The spinach artichoke dip is delicious. California carver pizza has grill onion ring toppings, very unique! I definitely recommend this place.",

Average bar food is what is being served. Gone are the plans for a beer dinner with pairings and quality dining. It has been replaced with quick foods of pizzas, strombolis and nachos. Not particularly sparkling but gets the job done when your main attraction is beer and Boulders does do beer well.  The staff has slipped into an easy, we serve those we know best and well, the rest of you, not so much. The bar has an easy 20 something feel, and its' patronage reflects it.",

It is dark, and oh Lawdy those bathrooms are atrocious. Worse than any I have ever encountered, not exaggerating. I want to love this place even more since it's so close, but I'm just not feelin it yet. It is fun to go out there, but the place itself is just okay to me. I am not a big fan of beer, but my husband is constantly ordering different beers and it makes him happy so I guess I'm happy too. Except for that one time he bought an $18 bottle of beer and nobody warned him it would cost that much. That was no fun and I feel like somebody should have mentioned that it was so costly since they recommended it. For shame. But yeah, I like it here and I will continue to come back on a fairly regular basis for sure.",

Instead of using the free offer from the kind owner, I went back to the restaurant and ordered BOTH of the suggestions that he had: The Asian Bob burger, and the California Carver pizza.  The burger was incredibly juicy and had a nice balance of sweet and savory. Two thumbs up.  The pizza was a crazy amalgamation of all that is yummy: Pepperjack cheese, onion strings, pico de gallo, turkey breast. The serving size was more than adequate for a single person and the taste was great!

Boulders really cares about their beer, and it shows. Not only are they constantly changing what's on tap (though not as unique these days, they've been doing it longer than most), but they keep track of their updated list through their own smartphone app. Its a simple app, but I thought it was a nice, extra step toward creating a positive experience.  Boulders has both good bar food and a very reasonable happy hour. If I still lived nearby this would be my ideal place to drop in for happy hour, try a few new beers, and get something to munch on. Though its been awhile since I've ordered a real meal here, I remember them being very good, especially the pizza/calzones.   This bar also doubles as a restaurant. The bar is separate enough from the restaurant seating area that I think you could reasonably take a family here without cause for concern. They also have a decent patio if you prefer to sit outside.  I highly recommend Boulder's to anyone who enjoys reasonably priced and constantly rotating craft beers.",

It shows was pleasant, polite, suggested a really good bet, and want over bearing. Overall i plan to come back here again, and would recommend this place any day.",

    "text": "This place is the epitome of your neighborhood bar.  Great place to get drunk at.  I would venture to say that this was one of the highlights of this neighborhood.  I started going here long before they even had the outdoor patio.  Yeah I knew about this place before it was cool.  Suck on that, hipsters.    Their food has improved by leaps and bounds.  I can happily eat their pizza now.  The California carver is especially good.  I wouldn't say its 5 star good but its worthy of bar food.  The 5 stars is for the atmosphere.    If you ever want some sage advice on a brew, ask the resident employee Chris Shinn.  His suggestions will not disappoint.    They are packed every Tuesday for trivia.  Be wary of the cheating redditors that play upstairs.  They don't leave their parents basement that often, therefore they don't understand that looking up the answer on your cell phone is frowned upon.    All in all this is a solid place to get a brew and some food.",

    "text": "If you love amazing music, come out to Boulders On Broadway.  They love their music so loud, they'll crank the speakers to ELEVEN!  Why I loved Boulders On Broadway before Upstairs Comedy: -Delicious hamburgers -Plenty of different beers on tap -A fine selection of games -Cool atmosphere -Friendly bartenders  You can finish reading if you don't care to read about how Boulders missed out on a big opportunity to be a great place for stand-up comedy.  When I was here back in May, this was a cool place to hang out with friends.  We played Jenga, drank, ate food, drank, watched sports, drank, and did some more drinking.  I had a good time.  Later that month, I started doing stand-up comedy on May 28th.  Two months later, comedy consumed me.  I caught the comedy bug and I wanted to get better, but there weren't enough True open-mic nights to work out new material where you can just go sign up and get on stage.  When I first heard Boulders was going to let us riff upstairs, I thought it was a dream come True.  To perform at Boulders, you didn't have to book yourself to get on the show, nor did you have to sacrifice your time to be one of the first ten people to show up or you didn't get to do comedy.  It was an open mic at its purest form.  And it was worth the thirty minute drive to get there too.  When we first started this, we were welcomed with arms wide opened.  The staff were very nice to us for providing waters for everyone and were very accommodating.  There are a few degenerates in our social circle, but that goes with any group of people.  That's no reason to treat us with less hospitality...like blaring music to accommodate only three people hanging out downstairs on a Sunday night, when there are more people trying to get better at comedy upstairs.  By drowning us out with your music and making our show less enjoyable, the show in general drew fewer audience members.  It was progressively getting less and less of a credible open mic night and more of a colossal waste of time.    I understand you don't like it when broke comedians are thrifty in withhold from spending money on your food and beverages, but most of us were at least trying to scrape out our piggy bank savings for food and alcohol to keep you fire-breathing dragons happy for us giving back to Boulders.  But that just wasn't enough to keep you from playing music on full-blast with your passive aggression towards our craft.  This is like writing a letter to an unrequited love and it is bringing tears to my eyes writing this.  We really wanted this to work, but this was a failed experiment on both ends.  I hope one day we can do a comedy show here again for old times sake, and I hope I can forget about this so I can return to the good old days at Boulders.  Thank you for the good times and I can't recommend this place enough to music lovers.",

Their too old said Scottsdale.  All they need is a hot tub time machine and this place would be packed!    Wings were out of this world delicious by the way.  Brews were good too but you can find so many other great brewery restaurants nearby that this would be a waste of your time.  If you want to get away from the ASU scene this is the place to do it.  If you want a good brewery keep looking.    Cheers",

The pizza recipes are solid, the California Carver is the go-to pie, but the signature hotdog selection will always hold a special place in my heart. \"Hungover Man's Best Friend\" lives up to the name.

I suppose it's fitting since I was there twice yesterday - for the Spain/France soccer game, and later for trivia.  Beverage Selection - 1 Star / 1 Star Excellent selection of craft and import brews. Extensive bottle list and over 20 draft beers. The Konig is a great summer hefe.  Food - Vegan - .75 Star / 1 Star So, there's only three vegan items on the menu - guacamole, hummus (I order with veggies not pita), and a side salad. Normally, this would get a restaurant .25 stars. However, yesterday they made me a really delicious dish of sauteed veggies with balsamic dressing, which was allowed because the kitchen was slow. Thanks to Lauren, our server, and Matt the GM for making this happen. I really appreciate it!  It would be really great if there was a hot, vegan entree. I'd be happy to pay $8-$12 for something with sauteed veggies, a sauce/dressing, and two-three different proteins (beans, nuts, avocado, rice, pasta, hummus, etc.) I love the guacamole, but its not a proper dinner.  Service - 1 Star / 1 Star Again, thanks to Lauren, and Matt for the great dinner! Also, our server earlier in the day (shaved head, wears a hat) was really good. Thanks for the Konig recommendation. The service here is usually pretty good, even when its really busy for trivia. Be a considerate patron (if they're packed, and you've been there for two hours getting wasted, don't get mad when it takes a few minutes for the server to split up your check and run your card,) and you'll get great service.  Ambience - 1Star / 1 Star A bit farther from campus than Mill Ave, the bro/bro-ho ratio is pretty low. Trivia is awesome, happy hour is relaxing, and there's a really fun atmosphere during Suns games.  Also, this place is really bike friendly with racks inside and out, and a tire pump. There are two larger rooms for big parties and seating upstairs.  There's also a patio, which is great in the winter because it faces west.  Cleanliness - 1 Star / 1 Star The bathrooms are clean and always have tp/ paper towels. There was some pretty awesome bathroom graffiti, but I noticed its been painted over. Tables never sit dirty for too long.   4.75 stars overall",

From Addya to Dave to Poopsie to Amy, we just keep gettin it good and keep comin back. Your food runner is top notch and a great idea! The mgr (I think) comes out to show us baby pics as if we were part of the Boulders fam even if we dont climb or ride. The patrons have become less, erm, gangstah and more neighborhood. I am so pleased this neighborhood cove found its way to realizing the fortune this hood can provide, given the right prices, decent food, a chill patio and good service. I could see Boulders expanding that patio and raking it in, should the city be as kind as to let them. One thing- chilly months? Do away with the cool, fancy looking heaters that dont work and do more with the other version. The fire pit is a great touch but it runs out often. Other than that, I hope you appreciate how amazing your core staff is. They are largely why we keep coming back!",

Their selections of beer are listed on the wall, so don't try looking for a beer menu.   I had a small pizza, which was pretty decent for the price. Ranger IPA was great, and only $2 for their big one (can't remember the exact size) during happy hour. They were pretty busy, but had a lot of servers working so we were being helped every few minutes. The pub itself is a dive, so if you like dives you'll like this joint.",

Despite being packed, the service was really good. That's all of the positives I have. It was hotter than heck and there was some serious price gouging going on. We've been to so many tap take overs I've lost count. I can't recall ever paying more than $9 for most of the beers. Boulders took full advantage of having some semi h beers and just marked it up to a deplorable price. $8 for 6.5oz of CBS is significantly higher than I've ever paid. $9 for  less than a full pint of KBS and Big Luscious...... SHAME ON YOU BOULDERS! Take some of your massive profits from last night and pay your a/c bill.",

Excellent weekly specials. Prime location with plenty of parking.  And, of course, there's...The Big Freakin' Nacho.   The BFN is truly the most unusual, potentially frightening and ultimately satisfying nacho-type dish I have ever utterly failed to finish, even with the assistance of multiple friends. It is served on a pizza platter.  A LARGE pizza platter. Enough calories to support a small Eurasian village through a long winter. And, oddly but pleasantly, the chips are made from fried pizza dough, and marinara has been subbed in for salsa.    An experience worth having.",

    "text": "This is one of those places I can see why people really like it, but I just didn't really like it (it was A-OK, though).   I really do like the place itself. The rock-climbing/bicycle theme is cool. There's two stories of seating with a large wrap around bar and a large patio (that's dog friendly, I believe). There's a very unpretentious vibe. I don't come to this area often, but it seems very post-ASU (and beyond), and that seems to be reflected in the crowd that comes here.   Here's the thing though...food, service, and beer selection (although this is debatable depending on what you like) isn't all that great. Admittedly, I'm basing this on one visit. Service was particularly questionable. Me & a friend were sitting at a table right by the bar and basically it seemed to be server by committee. A couple of bartenders would occasionally check on us &  I think a waitress who was actually working the floor came by twice. They were all friendly though (just not very attentive).  As for food, we ordered two HH items and I think that may have been the issue. There's like 7-8 items that are $3.99. That's a really good deal, but the portions are pretty small & you get what you pay for. We ordered the nachos and afterwards I heard a waitress tell the table next to us they were better off ordering the \"regular\" nachos instead of the HH ones if they were hungry. I wish I had heard this beforehand. The nachos tasted fine, but the HH portion comes in large soup bowl. Minutes later the table next to us got a ginormous, beautiful looking platter. I would have happily paid the $4-5 extra dollars for that and would have been set, instead of ordering another okay-ish HH item (tater tots in our case).   I'm not really beer expert (by any means), but I didn't think the selection here was that great (I say this because that seems to be a huge emphasis for this place). They didn't seem to have many beers you wouldn't normally find at a place that has a large tap selection.  I'd come back here if someone suggested it, but I wouldn't be the one doing the suggesting.",

I recommend sitting near the bar, to get the quickest service possible.  The seating is a little crowded here, especially on busy trivia nights. I can't be upset that the place is doing good business though.  My biggest gripe, is specifically in regards to my last visit. Without getting too specific, a drunk guy sitting behind me started shouting and swearing at me. When he saw it didn't phase me, he started with the threats. I kept my cool the whole time, thinking the staff at the bar, would take care of the guy who had too much to drink. I was wrong. They didn't kick him out, they even continued serving him alcohol. It was absolutely mind boggling to me that several bartenders witnessed the whole event, as well as all the customers in the vicinity, and yet none of them addressed the issue at all. I don't know if it's because of a lack of training on how to deal with such a situation, or if it was just a lack of caring. Either way, it left a real sour impression.",

It is a hipster place with TONS of seating and great burgers and wings. This is what I know of it so far. They have private room for parties, LOTS of craft brews of every sort.  Bike and car parking (unlike Four Peaks).   This is not \"upscale\" it is very relaxed, calming and the food is the same, nothing hugely complicated but lots to choose from. Wings are standard buffalo, (see pic), we ordered some of differing heat and none were beyond medium for my taste. I like them hotter but the meat was cooked properly and they were crispy.   You can also sit outside with the out of control misters.  It's good for your lungs, like a humidifier in the outdoors. I will highly recommend this place for happy hour, which is every hour.",

Without question, beer selection is the star of Boulders. The tap selection is wide & consistently rotates with fresh & diverse offerings. The food is mediocre & average for a bar & grill. It's kind of a jack of all trades, master of none approach to the menu with burgers, tacos, pizza, pasta.   Coming here to watch some sports might be seem to be a good idea, but the seat & screen placement creates some challenges for enjoying a sporting event.   Lastly, turn down the lighting in this place. It's awkwardly bright, bars shouldnt have lighting that makes you feel like you're at target or walmart. Pints, friends, & dim lighting make for a fantastic combination.",

    "text": "Boulders is heavily involved in a lot of community events and for that, they have my appreciation.  Their beer selection is excellent, and their food is reasonably good.  However they perpetually under-staff table servers, making for very slow service.  It is not uncommon to wait for 20 minutes for a simple drink order.  I can't speak to bar service, but eating at a table Boulders is an all-evening affair.  It doesn't do a lot of loud music, but it gets crowded at times and the noise level makes it a bit excessive.  Sitting in the upper level is usually quieter.  That said, it is not a bad place.  You could certainly do a good deal worse for bars in Tempe.  They have a good community of cyclists and climbers, and you can often meet interesting people.",

    "text": "I can't believe it has taken us 5 months to find this place since we moved here in November.  Given how much we miss our home back in Denver, Colorado, Boulders was like a little taste of home; laid back people, friendly staff, bikes and rock climbing gear scattered about, veggie friendly menu and more.  I have a few things that bumped this down from a 5 to a 4:  a) They have Fat Tire all over the place; fat tire coasters, fat tire decoration on their specials board, bikes here and there, etc.  But when my partner was so delighted to be able to get her favorite brew, Fat Tire, and tried to order it, they explained that they didn't *actually* have Fat Tire. She wound up getting an Odell's (another CO microbrewery), which was good....but was very disappointed.  b) The menu had some intense mis-spellings, things that if they'd ran a spell check, they would have fixed. Like vegitarian. As a marketing person, errors like that always annoy me. Nit-picky? Yes. But that's how I am.  c) Our first waiter made this whole deal about how he was going off shift to drink with his friends, and would have someone else take care of us, and bid us farewell. And then came back not, once, but twice. A little odd.  d) The bathrooms were a bit gross, and the ads expired in 2008?  However, the food was delicious. Our server Lindsay was new, so she had to check on a few things, but was friendly, timely, and made us feel very welcome.  While the people who came with us weren't impressed with their wings, the dip we got was delicious, and our other friend was super happy with their pizza.  We felt like we were at home. What a nice feeling.  Yes, I'm a bit picky about little things, but over all, we loved the atmosphere, the food, the microbrews, and the friendliness. I think we've found out local bar until we moved back to CO.",

I had the Kaiser calzone, and my wife had the Moose Drool Burger (jalapeno cream cheese and fried jalapenos). As always, the food was delicious, the restaurant is fun and clean, and the atmosphere was great. Our server Marrissa is the best though, she was our first server and our preferred person ever since. She knows the menu and can help select what to eat, she is always watching for and filling low drinks, and she is kind and helpful. The food and service are outstanding. The best part about Saturday is the special on burgers and sandwiches, $6 including a side (you must sign up for their free loyalty card). We are definitely regulars and always ask for Marrissa whenever possible. We just had another fun and delicious evening!",

They have an impressive beer selection and the prices are decent too.   We sat on the patio with nobody else around and our dog was allowed to sit with us, so that is a bonus. Our server even brought out some water for the little guy. The downside is that we were approached a couple of times by people asking for money or food. The last thing I want to do is sit and try to enjoy myself as people repeatedly come up and ask me for handouts, so I knocked a star off for that.   All of the food we had was good but there wasn't anything that I would go out of my way to get. I will probably be back for a drinking lunch someday since I work nearby or to grab a beer that you can't find anywhere else nearby. Bottom line is that I'm neutral on this place - won't avoid it or go out of the way for it.",

    "text": "If I was voting on beer selection this place would be a 5. They have a large selection of reasonably priced drafts and they change weekly brining in new and different beers to try.   I can also say most of the servers are very good. I come every week for trivia on tuesdays and the service is always good, nobody has any problem with splitting tabs for the 6 or so people we have every week. I never go long with out a drink or waiting to order. It is a very well run crew.  Now for the bad the food is very hit or miss and even the hits aren't that exciting. Since I am here on tuesdays I often get appetizers as they are half off. Some like the southwestern or apple/pear quesadillas are good and a solid amount of food. Others like the pizza wheels are barely edible. I have had some of the regular menu items and they often suffer from being bland or over salted. Some recommendations of mine on stuff to get include the california carver burger or pizza, the hummus appetizer, and the tatonka burger.   Also costing them points is bad AC and that the bathroom may be one of the worst I have seen in an otherwise decent place. They have a horrible hand dryer that isn't high flow or hot and they don't have paper towels as an option. The door to the toilet doesn't have any lock and swings open on it's own.  If you want a place to have fun drinking and playing trivia you can do worse than here. Just be careful with the food selections and don't get your hopes up.",

    "text": "I have not had beer here, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. It's beer. It comes from a tap or a bottle or a can. If you think that is an amazing feat worth writing about, come by and check out this killer lint I found in my navel. It's totally sweet. Bro.   The food was awful. I don't know how else to describe it. The group I came with ordered an assortment of things and we each tried a bit of the others food to confirm it was cold, bland and stale. I ordered a burger, medium-rare. It came overcooked and tasted like rubber. The bun was soggy. All the veggies on the burger were past their prime. It had no flavor. None. I tried adding ketchup and mustard and it did not help at all. I also ordered some Pepperoni Wheels. They were okay, but the marinara was off. It was chunky. Like salsa. Sort of. Large chunks of unidentifiable food stuffs floating in a vaguely red tomato-ish sauce. I ate two Wheels and that was enough. The ketchup was off too. It looked and tasted more like cocktail sauce. I don't know, maybe the staff was running on a lean mixture this day and muddled up the sauces. Who knows? I sure don't.   One of my friends ordered some wings. Those were not bad in my book, but she didn't like them at all. When you can still taste the vinegar over the hot sauce, I can see how it can be a turnoff.   I can't recommend this place. Never have I been in and out of a restaurant so fast before. We all got to-go boxes, which we promptly deposited into the outside trashcan by the parking lot.",

    "text": "When I left Arizona six years ago, the craft beer scene consisted of Papago Brewery and Four Peaks. I would never complain about either, but there just wasn't much going on. After a recent visit, however, I found that there are not only a ton of new breweries but pretty awesome beer bars as well. Bravo, Arizona.    My visit just happened to coincide with AZ Beer Week (seriously) and Boulders on Broadway had an impressive lineup of drafts for the occasion.The day prior, they had tapped Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, something that beer bars in San Diego only dream about. They also had a bunch of seasonals and local beers that I would never be able to get back home.  After a few beers, I wanted pizza, my significant other did not... but this caused no problem at all due to their \"personal\" sized pizzas.  Genius!  Why don't more bars do this? Life is great when you're not arguing with friends about topping choices.   I only wish this place was around when I was in college. No offense to Devil House (RIP), but chugging penny beers until someone broke the seal (literally, tape covering the bathroom door) just doesn't seem to measure up.",

There are usually craft beer related events going on a couple of times a month that are truly epic. Recently I have been there for a tap takeover and a Beer for Brains event that were top notch.  Thursday night is my favorite...1/2 price bottles of beer. You can really do some damage for not a lot of money on some awesome craft beer. If you live in the area, this is a perfect place to ride your bike to for some brews.  There is some pretty fierce competition for team trivia on Saturday nights, but I secretly think that there are some cheating teams upstairs. No one is checking them. Maybe I'm just bitter for coming in second place, but still.",

I have been looking for a place with plenty of beer choices, good food, and a good environment. This place had all three, and i will be going back. I didn't take any pictures of what i ordered, because they are already on Yelp. Before going, i looked them up on Facebook and saw that they were doing half price pizza all day. Needless to say, i ordered pizza. I got the Chuck Norris, which was basically a meat lovers. Very tasty and cooked very well. For thin crust (also available in deep dish if not getting a small), none of it was burned. I was impressed. The house red sauce is extremely tasty but on some bites thats all i could taste. Again, not a bad thing. What i really enjoyed was the side of Jalepeno Tots that i ordered. Those things...were freaking amazing. Cooked very well and not overdone in the fryer. Perfectly soft and DELICIOUS. I would go back just for those alone. As for the beer, i don't explore much, i typically stick with light beer. But they had dozens of available beers on tap that i have never heard of. This should satisfy any beer lovers taste buds. Finally, the environment was laid back and not loud. This is what i prefer. There was a mix of all ages, and it definitely was different than the overly young crowd which overpopulates Mill ave. I will be back very soon.",

They have an extensive food menu and we've had the only two veggie options over and over....the black bean burger and the tree huggin veg head. The black bean burger is ok. Tastes like a frozen patty burger. The handcut chips make up for the burger. The tree huggin veg head is full of artichokes and makes for tasty alternative. I've had the spinach artichoke calzone and it was huge and delicious, and I felt way too guilty for eating the whole thing. The vegetarian Kaiser pizza is a decent pizza...it tasted a little \"manufactured\" but I still ate the whole thing.

    "text": "We ordered two sodas, an order of cheese curds and one 14\" thin crust pizza.  The bill was $32.06 plus tip.  Almost $40 for pizza that had what tasted like Hunt's Tomato Sauce directly out of the can on it.  I tasted no garlic, no oregano, no spice at all.  Just plain Jane canned tomato sauce.  I honestly would have enjoyed Litte Ceasars Pizza more.  I will say the cheese curds were amazing and the staff was very friendly.  We have had sandwiches there before that were pretty good, but were terribly disappointed in the pizza.  It was also incredibly stuffy in there.  No air movement at all.  Very musty smelling and warm.",

After getting a beer we never saw the waitress again for 30 minutes.  At that point she took food orders for about 1/2 of the folks at my table, missing me and probably 5 others.  She disappeared again, returning 30 minutes later.  About this time I went to the bar to get another beer and the first bartender (and they weren't busy) basically turned his back on me.  The second one did serve me.  Another 30 minutes later, now tired of this, tracked down the waitress, settled my tab and walked out.  Bottom line the servers were overwhelmed.  I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "On the night of a show at The Clubhouse, I went to a record store to pick up the tickets. I had researched restaurants close to the venue on Yelp before I left and decided on Boulders. I asked one of the record  store clerks whether he had been there, and he said he had. I asked if he liked it, and he said he didn't. When I asked why, he said \"It's just not really my scene.\" He then followed up with, \"Are you into like, craft beers, and like indie rock, mountain biking, that kind of thing?\" Umm, yeah, pretty much. \"Then you'll like it.\"  This is my new place. Although I feel a bit typecast, I guess they nailed it for a dude like me. Cider for the gf, Bell's Two Hearted Ale draft for me (that alone is worth about 3 or 4 stars in my world), and we split a \"build your own\" pizza. It was thin crust, which reminded me of Rosati's, although it could have used some more sauce (maybe I'll ask for extra next time).   The beer selection is awesome - just about every awesome IPA (I prefer hoppy stuff) that I could think of. If I remember right, there were like 20 or 30 on draft. Such a relief when the fanciest beer I can get at a lot of restaurants I go to is Sam Adams, Fat Tire, or Guinness. We were talked into a skillet cookie to top it off - not something I'd do every time, but well worth it.  I love this place, and I will surely be coming back.",

I went on Halloween this year, and everyone was dressed up, it was quite amusing. The building appears to be built into the side of a hill, so there aren't any windows, this kinda gives the place a darker- shadier feel. However, their alcohol and beer selection is pretty amazing. The person I was with was pretty impressed, and I've had friends talk about this place often.   We had hamburgers stuffed with pepperoni, cheese, mushroom, and other pizza toppings. They were a bit dry, but still delicious, I recommend trying one of the burgers, for sure. The burchetta was by far the best appetizer I've had in a long time. The guy taking our order disappeared a few times, so it took us a long time to get our check and food, but if you're having drinks that won't be noticeable.",

The food that we get there are usually the burgers and fries which are great.  The pizza isn't too bad and recommend the thin crust over any of the thicker pizzas.    I recommend the SW Chicken Quesadilla and it is somewhat spicy.  The steak sandwhich is literally the best sandwhich I've ever had and my wife agrees.   The salads are hit or miss; I've had one good salad and two pretty horrible iceberg lettuce based ones so avoid the salads as they always seemed a little wilted.    Go there if you have a party of about 5 max as its kinda hard to find seating during Trivia nights.  I hosted my birthday there sometime ago and rented out the upstairs.    To sum up: great location; great people and great bar.  It would get a 5th star if their upstairs was more developed and they hosted real, live music instead of the brutal jukebox.",

Jake is a great server, and we have been served by the manager a handful of times - and he gave great service.   Now for the cons...  One server at the establishment, by the name of Izaak, was our server again tonight at Boulders. We all were within ear shot of each of his horrible comments he continued to make throughout the night. Directly behind our table he called us \"shitty tippers\" and as we were leaving he sneered at us and stated a derogatory comment wherein he said \"fuck\". As he picked up our tabs he had an angry affect and made a sarcastic \"wow\" statement while taking the bills away. Has it ever occurred to this person that they possibly do not get stellar tips (as we always make sure to tip even if we get awful service) because their service at times is rather mediocre? Talking shit about patrons in front of their faces is pretty damn unprofessional. If your service is mediocre, then your tip will be the minimum and you shouldn't be shocked about that.   This last night was honestly the last straw in regard to this poor service, and me and my friends will not be returning again. I am writing this review to give possible future patrons a heads up and let them know what might be in store for them.",

I love that they have indoor bike racks viewable from the bar; a perfect feature for people like me who always forget my lock.   They have pretty fantastic drink specials and a solid craft beer list. All September they're doing $3 Oskar Blues cans. They also do all day happy hour on Saturday's, half price pizza on Monday's, and Trivia Night on Tuesday's & Sunday's.   I can't say the food is anything worth writing home about, but for what they offer they do it well & the service has always been great. All around a good place!",

For a place known for having revolving craft beer, I'd expect not to repeatedly get flat drinks, we mentioned the problem to the manager a few different occasions and kept getting told it must just be the end of the keg; if I end up here I only get bottled beverages now.   We kept trying the menu items and after eating most of them among us on our visits I can only recommend the wings and the fried zucchini.

Met a friend for drinks on a Thursday night at 8 o'clock, took half an hour for them to come get our order. Took another 20 minutes to get my drink which was supposed to be a strawberry margarita. I cannot be for sure if there was even alcohol in it they don't own a blender so it wasn't blended and it tasted bitter as if it was old alcohol. In the two and a half hours my friend and I SAT there chatting the guy came back only once to ask my friend if he wanted another beer. Then it took almost an hour for us to get the check so we could leave. Definitely not a place I will be going back to. I kinda feel sorry for my friend who is in town on business who definitely didn't get to enjoy himself.   The table was sticky upon sitting down, the place is very dated. It is most definitely not wheelchair friendly as there  are steps everywhere and I didn't see a wheelchair ramp anywhere. I ordered the cookie with ice cream on top it was so over cooked it was crispy and not very fresh.  The only good thing was that they took my margarita off the bill since the waiter saw that I had barely drank any of it.",

    "text": "Boulders on Broadway has been one of my infrequent go-to's ever since moving to the Tempe area about two years ago. It's a very consistent experience, albeit a somewhat expected one.  The beer menu is pretty good - not great, but better than other bars in the area. The menu is also pretty good - plenty of yummy options, nothing necessarily earth-shattering.  My typical order is the California Carver Burger, which is always really tasty, and my FAVORITE thing about the place is that they serve DELICIOUS waffle fries. can't get enough go those!  Service is always also \"just ok\". Nothing to write home about in all the times I've been there, although certainly acceptable. Everyone's typically pretty busy, to be honest.  The ambiance is nice for a bite to eat or to grab a drink with a friend, but I never bother bringing my laptop or anything - there are better bars (and coffee shops!) for that.  The one minor complaint I have about Boulders is that waiter service can sometimes be outrageously slow. Getting your food: can also sometimes be unbelievably slow.  The only reason I make mention of this is so that you don't expect to squeeze a \"quick lunch\" in if you're on the clock. You'll likely go over (been there, done that, I'm afraid...).  Overall, I'd give Boulders on Broadway 3 stars. BUT... Because they serve those tantalizing waffles fries that keep me coming back... I'm happy to give them 4 stars instead.  :)",

They're constantly rotating through only the best beers and always have plenty to offer in the high-hopped varieties, which tend to be my favorites -- from Dogfish IPA to Stone to Bell's Two Hearted Ale.  The service here is also excellent, both at the bar and at the tables. For a college town, the scene is pretty diverse. There are plenty of early twenties hipsters and hipsterettes but I've never felt like I was the only person over 30 here.  The thin crust pizza is also quite excellent. I always order it extra crispy and it's consistently done right. I'm not too sure about the other menu items yet.   If you like a relaxed atmosphere, really good beer, and tasty pizza, give Boulders on Broadway a try!",

Let me say first that I have always wanted to come here just to have a sit down with friends and drinks, but it so happens my son and I walked in one day after a busy day of errands.  I did not want to cook and it was on our way home.  I was disappointed right off the bat because we sat down and I don't know what, because it was just me and my son, but no one wanted the table, (I know how it is, i used to wait tables) but we waited patiently and after about 10 minutes server came over and said he did not see us and apologized.  More than likely taking a smoke break due to he smelled like smoke.  We ordered nachos and cheese sticks, (weren't very hungy) and they were fine.  My complaint to this place would be that I went to ask if they had SunBru from Four Peaks and in Tempe you should be carrying FourPeaks anything at all times, in my opinion!  The server I asked said yes they had it and then my server came back to get my drink order. I asked and he said he would check and came back and said infact no they did not have it.  I settled for an FP 8th street Ale.  The server seemed nervous checking on us, not sure was that was about but he rarely came by, my son was never offered a refill on his drink and I was not offered another beer... seemed weird for a bar... anyway we waited about 10 minutes for the check and when we walked out after completing the transaction, no one said a word to us.  Very strange place.  I can see the neighborhood bar attraction and I wish it was different but I will not set foot in this place again.  Will stick with the ol standby, Four Peaks and never stray again!",

The odd thing is I have never heard about this place till I started working down in Tempe, but once I tried it I will drive across town on the weekends even when I am not working to go here. I suggest trying the Pizza and the Pizza Nachos, they are my absolute favorites. This place gets PACKED in the evenings and on weekends but it is a casual environment and is highly recommended.",

Currently the staff has been better then they were in the past, this place does have a niche crowd, and a lot of their regulars know each other and converse and it can be cool at times and other times the regulars can make people feel very unwanted . they make the place their own which is cool but it can be a bit daunting and un welcoming for people who havent been here before . the beer choices are always on point . the food is hit and miss the pizza is decent . the wings are not suggested . over priced small and dry. The sandwiches are okay their other apps are all pretty decent .",

It serves it's purpose and usually what I've ordered is tasty. They have amazing fried pickles!  The beer list is also good. They rotate the taps a lot so there is usually something new for me to try.  \"So, Andi. What's the problem?\"  The service here SUCKS. Like really, really bad. I've been here on busy nights (Trivia, Tap Takeover, other events) and I've been here in the middle of the day when it was a ghost town. Same result: bad service.  I've had beers sit empty while I try to spot where my waitress is. I've waited to get my check for 45 minutes. I've even had to go ask a different waitress what's up to find out mine dipped without saying anything.  Overall, I think Boulders has the potential to be a cool spot. It just needs a MAJOR service-adjustment.",

I had the cheesy beef sandwich & it was very yummy. The star for me was the bread, it was fresh & tasted baked in house. The aus jus was also very good.

We also ordered nachos that came out wrong...they comped us and brought out a second order of nachos...those were burnt to hell.

The reason for the Four Stars is because I feel they were under staffed and that the waiting staff felt rushed. Our waitress did what she could for us but sadly we felt almost ignored. I know this wasn't her fault. I saw her running around non-stop. Then the big cookie for dessert was okay. It tasted more like a pancake then a cookie.

    "text": "Boulders has been my go-to neighborhood bar for a while (BEER LIST), but really exceeded my expectations this week, and merited a review.   I recently coordinated a professional development event for the graduate students in my department. We wanted a place with good beer and food, but also that had a private room that was quiet enough that we could talk. This doesn't seem like a tall order, but Boulders was the only place we knew that had a private, quiet room. I've seen a chess club meet in there a few times.  We had a large party of 15, and we were seated in the \"lounge,\" a room off the main dining area with a booth, a large table, and a door! The room was perfect, and everyone was able to hear the professor that came to speak to us. Our server Jake took excellent care of our group, and was really respectful and deft at delivering orders, refilling waters, and getting additional rounds of beer without interrupting our speaker. He even closed the door quietly as he came and went. I felt like the staff really went above and beyond to accommodate us, and the meeting went off without a hitch thanks to their help.  Thank you, Boulders! I don't think we'll ever meet on campus again. :)",

Breakfast was good - the sweet potato tots were crispy crunchy delicious, bacon was well... bacon. Egg dishes were cooked to perfection. Aside from the rude Bears fan near us, it was a great morning at Boulders on Broadway. Love the bike rack too!",

They need to get it up on their website and highlight it!  I'll be back to try the others . . . the Chuck Norris looks good, and I've heard evangelical things about something involving a hot dog . . .  but I've had the Arizona French Toast. Longboards of french toast baugette with candied jalepenos, powdered sugar.  Comes with AZ honey, but I got syrup instead, and added a side of bacon.  Add Four Peaks Brewery's Hop Knot IPA in a frozen glass. Fantastic. The candied jalepenos . . . sweet with plenty of heat, seems wrong but it was SO right . . .

The reason I'm giving this two stars is that when you place an online order on LivingSocial, expect to wait an additional 30 minutes before your order is ready, as they don't start preparing it until you arrive.  I had an order scheduled for pickup at 5:30PM on a weekday, and waited literally 30 minutes for it. I even placed the order a few hours earlier to give them extra time in case they were busy. They claimed that they receive orders via fax, and nobody is in the office. Moral of the story, if you place an online order, you need to call them before you arrive, otherwise, expect to wait a while for it.",

Great food, great staff, a crowd that is a nice mix of students and other folks. A real neighborhood bar with just enough college vibe but not so much that anyone over 30 feels painfully out-of-place. Came in recently with a big group, we sat upstairs and the service was a tad tardy but I completely understood, we didn't realize how big our group would be. They shanghai'd extra wait staff to keep us all happy and I gotta say we WERE happy. Love the big-ass nachos and hell, pretty much everything there.  The only complaint I would ever have about their food, is that recently I had some kind of stuffed burger and the meat just was not cooked thoroughly enough, and it took so long to get my order that I really wasn't about to send it back and wait even longer.  But, hey, shit happens sometimes. This is by far the exception there. I will keep coming back, love ya Boulder's! If only you could open up one by my area of Phoenix!",

As far as the interior of Boulders, there was much to like: a bar area, a restaurant area, a second floor with pool table, a Christmas tree with beer can ornaments, and a outside patio.  The menu was normal bar far with an emphasis on their pizzas.  So I went for a pizza.  I chose the California Clutter or something like that.  It had onion rings, avocado, lots of cheese, and was supposed to have turkey.  Instead I got peppers in place of meat.  The deep dish was quite weaksauce in terms of the thickness of its crust.  It was more like a pyramid of crackers.  Though in the end, the pizza was decent.  My friend and I split an order of garlic cheese bread (what I had been craving at Four Peaks) and it was decent though the marinara sauce that came as a side looked like it came from a can.  Then there was the service.  We never got napkins or silverware until I finally asked for a fork towards the end of my meal.  There's no host stand, so you have to seat yourself (a sign would have been nice to indicate that this was the case).  We were supposed to get plates for our garlic bread, but those never materialized.  I guess if you look it as a bar and lower your standards for the food and the service, then you could be content.  However, I have enjoyed delicious food and had great service at bars in the Valley, so I can't.",

So to break out of the norm, I was in search of a place with excellent beer and good food and somewhat close to home. So onto Yelp I go and came upon Boulders, and the reviews were pretty good and definitely worth checking out. So we all pack into the car and head over to Boulders. The parking is great, plenty of spaces to go around. You walk through the patio, not bad with all the misters, felt like I was in a rainforest, but very refreshing. So you walk a little further, watch the steps, and there's your bar. Very open, plenty of hightop tables and lots of TV's. The beer menu was plentiful. It should make everyone from the microbrewer to the coors drinker happy. I was pleased because they had plenty of vegetarian meals, or dishes you can substitute meat for veggies... and for you meat eaters out there, I was told the burgers were delicious and the waffle fries were soooo tasty. The staff was helpful and attentive as well. I would definitely add this into our Friday night rotation. If you're looking for microbrews, this is a place to check out. The atmostphere is kicking and just an all around good place to kick back.",

I love Boulders and  have been going there almost every week since the 1st time a year ago..  The staff is friendly and always welcoming and very accommodating.  Most of the waiters remember what I drink each time and have it on the table before I even sit down (no lie!).   I have tried many of the menu items but my favorite is the pine nut bleu cheese salad.  The appetizers are half price on Tuesdays and the portion sizes are huge so you get a really good value for the price. My son usually gets the pizza nuggets and his friends usually get the nachos which are yummy. I have to agree with the other reviewers, pertaining to their comments on the air conditioning or lack there of.  I am usually so involved in discussion or trivia brainstorming that I can forget about the heat (after all we do live in Arizona and I am somewhat used to it by now), but more ceiling fans might be nice.  I recommend Boulders to anyone who is looking for a fun, casual, entertaining time.  Tuesday nights have been packed lately so you would want to get there early if you have a big group.  On second thought, maybe you would want to go on a night other than Tuesday, so my group will be sure to have a place to sit together.   Enjoy!",

The definite pro of this place was the service. They were very accommodating to our large party, even gave us our own party room without a reservation or anything. Our waiter for the party had an incredible memory and handled about 30 different orders and bills... pretty impressive. The drinks here were fine, nothing to write home about, but not bad. I got to try a few different food items, the artichoke dip, a couple of the quesadillas, and pepperoni wheel. None of the food was anything I would go back for. The best thing was the hot sauce with the southwest quesadilla. As impressed as I was with the service, I wouldn't rush back here any time soon.",

It was seriously the best service we have had in a very long time including any other restaurant that we frequent! She was friendly, fast, and made the experience the best we've had at this establishment! Thank you Kristin!",

As briefly as possible, I ordered food for delivery. 90 minutes later it wasn't here so I finally called (should have earlier). The employee told me she didn't take my order so she couldn't help me, and she then hung up...seriously?! I then called back, and asked for the manager, and the same employee said she was the manager and couldn't help me, then she hung up again.  So I called a 3rd time and demanded to speak with the real manager.  Surprisingly, or not, the manager then treated me the same way. My food finally showed up as I was on the phone with the manager, 100 minutes after I ordered. Because it got there, the manager refused to refund me, and refused to acknowledge that her superbly sub-par employee was out of line.  No person should ever, ever hang up on a customer, period.  Oh, and the food was also sub-par.  Avoid at all costs. I wish this experience on no one, even the orange haired guy.",

Our waiter smelled like booze and messed up again and again and again: forgetting our drink order, bringing the wrong drinks TWICE, forgetting one drink altogether (our daughter I s too young to speak up so we didn't realize it till after we left), etc. The cheeseburger arrived without cheese on it, one order was delivered with stuff missing, and another person's order never got put in at all. (Waiter blamed the kitchen and claimed it got burned but we didn't buy it.) We did get comped the forgotten order, which finally arrived maybe half an hour later. Every single person of the five at our table had our orders messed up in some way at least once.   We've had mediocre service there a few times before, but this was too much. Food was ok and the manager is cool, but the waiter was obviously wasted.",

The first time was on a Saturday night. The place was packed for trivia and emptied out quickly after the game.  I shared the honey chicken sandwich with a friend and it was quite good. The waffle fries were delish too.  The second time was a Sunday afternoon for the all you can eat one topping pizzas for $7 per person. I got green chilies as my topping and loved it. It the pizza gourmet? No. Is it a great pizza for the price? Yes! I powered my way through 1 1/2 pizzas and took home the leftovers.  Make sure you bring your appetite!",

They took away their best burger, the Tatonka, their best appetizer, the Buffalo Chicken Dip, and one of their best sandwiches, the Ro' Diddy. They also changed all-day happy hour from Saturday to Sunday. Before this, they took away my favorite breakfast item from weekend brunch, which was this great twist on scrambled eggs on a hot dog with bacon, green peppers and jalapeno cream. It was called the Hangover Man's Best Friend that went really well with sweet potato tots. Then we never saw Izaak after all these changes took place. The new servers didn't take the time to get to know us like Izaak did. It's unfortunate. I took away a star for every item they took off, +1 for being awesome before all these changes, and +1 because Izaak was/is the best. Our last hope was the sister restaurant on Southern, Boulders on Southern, but alas, to no avail. They had the same changes. Our tradition must now change, and we are seeking a new local spot.",

I always had a good time due to the company, but it's just your average hang out restaurant. I came here for trivia night on Sat and the host at the door kindly informed us that we could seat ourselves at the bar or be seated somewhere in the GIANT restaurant. There are so many nooks it's crazy. We decided to sit at the bar and quickly found a table. It was busy, lots of people there for late dinners and trivia as we found out. Our server was nice and we indulged mostly in beers, and ended the night with two HH apps as we were starting to get hungry. A funny exchange I had while wanting to order food:  Me to bus boy: Hi! What's the difference between the mexican nachos and boulder nachos? (we didn't have a dinner menu) Bus boy: The chips (walks away)  Me and my bf just had to laugh. Later when our server came by we found out that there is a lot more different than just the chips.   I can't speak to the quality of their entrees, as we only had mozz sticks and mexican nachos, but we'll be back for trivia and beer.",

Will order again.  3.5 - I did and it wasn't that great. The bbq mahi mani salad had what they called bbq sauce but was more like a too tangy catalina dressing. The salad had water in it probably from not draining the black beans correctly. Pretty tasteless and now I have a stomach ache.",

One of the best parts about this place is their employees. There are several amazing individuals that work here and provide a wonderful customer service experience. Being a regular has its perks.   You can never go wrong with a burger, hungover mans best friend, or one of the phenomenal quesadillas. I love that their menu is diverse and most everything is thoroughly enjoyable. They have great specials every day of the week and trivia night is always a blast.   Do yourself a favor and stop in here for an evening beer and burger or even better, a weekend breakfast and a famous Doubleday Bloody Mary.",

We were in Tempe on vacation so we're looking around. Looking on Yelp we settled on Boulders On Broadway. It ended up being a real good choice. Plenty of parking and easy to find. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome. It's a simple gesture but other places seem to forget to do it. Good nachos and deep dish pizza. We spent a good four hours drinking and eating, watching NCAA tournament basketball and playing darts. No pool table here but fun was had by all.  Even played some songs on the jukebox. The jukebox was hooked up to the TouchTones phone app. So we could pick songs from our phone without getting up. You just pay for credits and pick songs on your phone. It was easy. Overall, a great bar to relax with friends. Not too rowdy and lots of booths for some privacy if needed. Great customer service. The crew working there are very patron friendly. Support local business especially the good ones. In Tempe is Boulders On Broadway. A gem of a bar/ pizza joint. Eat and drink here.",

I love the outdoor staff and have had a good time inside as well, but feel more \"at home\" on the patio due to the sheer number of hours I've spent there! We regularly have Ashley help us, who is an amazing server.  I always feel very welcome at Boulders and it is one of my favorite restaurants. I have celiac disease and have never become ill after eating their gluten free pizza, which is very rare for me when I order gluten free crust. Typically I just assume cross contamination can occur, but Boulders seems to do a stellar job at preventing it.   Since I can't have beer, I often feel a bit out of place ordering a cocktail. I wish they had more ciders on draft, but I'm happy with the ace joker!   The food is amazing. I've brought both my parents to Boulders and they may be skeptical initially, but both leave very happy!  I love this place and am so happy they are so close to me.",

I had to walk all the wY to the back of the restaurant and ask for help to pick up the order. No one seemed that interested in taking care of me.

The emcee reads a question and gives you a few minutes to write down and turn in an answer - plenty of time to chat with your party and continue conversation while participating in the trivia activity simultaneously. A mix of challenging and easier questions - overall, really well-run!   Nice selection of beers, and they were cheap - $4.50 for 14oz. beers and $4 for well drinks - not bad! The only food we tried were the pepperoni pizza rolls - they were okay, but didn't have a ton of flavor, and it didn't seem like the five 1\" rolls were really worth $10.   The service is why I'm giving it three stars - we had to waive down our server every time we needed something (even when 5+ members of our party had empty water glasses!). It's nice to be left alone to enjoy the trivia, but we were also there to enjoy drinks and food, which was hard to do when our server was nowhere to be found. The trivia was enough fun that I'll definitely be back, though!",

After finishing my beer (and I took my time with it) I still had no wings and the server had not come by. So I moved to the bar and again was ignored until I called out to her and asked her to check on the wings. When I finally got them and looked in the box I had two small pieces of celery. Then when I got home and tried the wings I can say they were the worst I've ever had. Thick breading, dry as a bone. My opinion is don't go there. Period.",

Seriously hard to explain, its got chips (that are more like a fried wonton/pizza crust) and all the best pizza toppings like cheese, pepperoni, sausage (and more) with a side of marinara. I swear this order is HUGE (probably on a Large pizza dish) and could potentially feed a large group but I could probably eat the whole thing by myself due to its tastiness.

Not a big fan. Kinda doughy.  -Ordered the California Carver Burger which was really good.  -I chose a house salad for my side with the burger, which was on the list of options along with the waffle fries and caesar salad.  However, when my bill came I was charged $3.50 for the salad, which is the full price for the house salad. I didn't receive any other side with my burger and, after double checking the menu, no where did it say anything about an extra charge for a salad. I'm not someone who makes a fuss, especially over $3.50, but when I asked the waiter about it his response didn't make any sense. All he said were things like \"the manager makes us do that\" and \"it's so stupid\" and that \"the caesar salad doesn't come with an extra charge, but the house does.\" He did end up taking it off, but the fact he made up a bunch of excuses that didn't make sense left us all confused.  Enjoy the good food, but be sure to review your check carefully!!",

Follow by wings with yummy sauce and finished with the apple cobbler. (Mmmhhhmm) Even though we were camping at a table and it was a bit busy we receive great service for hours.

Also I got the Broadway flub and if you want cheese it's extra. It was delicious. My brother got the southwest turkey, it was okay. My sister built her own burger.   The service wasn't great.

Our server was plenty attentive and called us by our names which was cool. I only had a water, but I was able to get it refilled. We were in a separate room which was nice to have some privacy, and there was a large window at the front to see people walking by. The bathrooms had a smell but whatever.

Food is average at best, very generic, not sure where they get their food from, tastes frozen and reheated.  I've had the battered fish and chips, personal pizza (which came with a salad that was fresh and good!) and cheesy beef sandwich which is REALLY small, but it's lunch menu, haven't ever tried the dinner menu.  Fish and Chips is a good portion, way too much breading, fish is meh and more chips than anything, definitely a gift from the Greasy Carb fairy.  Pizza is cracker thin, crispy, tasted like a Totino's frozen made in a toaster oven. Side salad comes with pizza thank god, good size and was fresh. Cheesy beef sandwich was small, no cheese to be found, beef seemed like Steakum and Au Jus was brown tasteless water with a hue of grease floating on top.  Servers are friendly and attentive, HOWEVER, I personally can't go here for lunch anymore as it takes FOREVER to get your food.  I literally have waited over 30 min once order was placed to get your food. Pretty sure I have 3rd degree burns on my tongue from having to woof down the fish and chips in the few minutes I had remaining for lunch. Overall, it's typical bar food, nothing more nothing less, didn't expect much and that's what I got, but the wait for the food that's being served is excessive.  If you're willing to go into Tempe, there's much better fare being served and you'll get it alot faster if time is a concern.",

The Mexican nachos, chicken quesadilla, Jamaican jerk wings, and club sandwich are among my favs that I rotate through.   Can't go wrong with BOB!",

If you like beer and excellent bar food, this is your spot.    The building is interesting and the people watching is even more so.  This is definitely a hippie/hipster/college kid hangout but everyone was so friendly, and I'm talking staff and patrons alike.  You can tell a lot about a place by the friendliness of the people who spend their money there.

The menu has great variety, whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian, or looking for lighter fare. And yes, they do have french fries.  The greatest thing about this place, though, is how they make it a playground for the community. It's a climbers' bar, so the decor speaks to that, but they also have ample bike parking and regular community events. Also, trivia. So much trivia. On Wednesdays and Saturdays!   Long story short, it's basically the Cheers of Tempe. I wouldn't bring out-of-towners in to admire its glory, but I'd freak out of someone from the area told me they'd never been there. As a downtown-Phoenix loyalist, I still make my way to TempeTown about once a month to enjoy this space with good company. Cheers!",

So all nine of us went searching for a place for dinner. Our first choice, who I am not going to disclosed. Is closed on Sundays, and it wasn't Chick fil A! So we ended up coming here. Now when we first walked in, we where told to sit any where we wanted. I had some doubts at first, the music they had on was some kind of meditation type. And the first item I seen on the menu was the Tree huggin Veg head! I was like, NO! Lets go! But my professional beer drink-en cousin seen the list of beers, so we decided to stay! And I was glad that we did! Food: I had their Ro Diddy Steak Sandwich, it is basically a steak sandwich with red peppers and cheese. I really enjoyed it. Meals comes with a choice of sides, I had their fries. Their fries are actually cross cut fries, just like the ones at Arby's. Meal was very good.  The rest of the crew had many different items, seems like everyone enjoyed dinner. Service:  As soon we walked in, they were on top of us right away. We sat, they took our drink order, and we got our food very quickly. Our waitress did seem to forget about us at the end. But no big deal, place really got busy during the evening. But throughout our meal, she took very good care of us.  Yes I judged this place by their cover, and glad I was proven wrong. Since we live in the west valley, our visits will be limited. But I will make it a point, when we visit the area to come here.",

There are misters out there for when it's hot. They have a great selection of beer and I've liked every food item I've ordered. The staff is also great.    I recently started going to team trivia. It's a lot of fun. They start promptly at 630. Punctuality is not our strong suit so our group ends up trickling in during the first few questions but still a fun time. We do not win.   Couple things though I cannot forget to bring up but will not effect my rating.  1) Get that beer menu back on the chalkboard. Like seriously, it was amazingly useful. We all agree that it is a tragedy it is not there.  2) They don't have cherries.This practically made my friend cry. I do not support this.  **shout out to our awesome server last week Lauren.

I'm just not a fan of making that app replace lists at the tables.   other than that, solid atmosphere, decent bar food. I can sincerely say that the quality of service there varies GREATLY from server to server. it seems like some really want their customers to be happy and others just sort of want to make it through the day.   the bartender who i think is named Chris takes his job seriously and always has good recommendations. Also, can't say enough nice things about their waitress Stefanie. I typically try to sit in her section if I can look around and see if she's working. Everyone there is nice and pleasant, I just feel like I get better service from these two in particular.   Tuesday trivia still as fun as ever. Their hot wings are also delicious, though I wish there were a little bit crispier.",

But what happens when you don't have a smartphone? You can ask your server for their phone, but obviously you would feel bad for taking a long time to decide since they're literally \"waiting\" on you.  They do have their drink list on a TV downstairs, but the print is so small that you have to get into another table's grill just to read it.   After circumscribing through the drink menu issue, you then realize that there are no PRICES on the menu. So I hope you know which beers are expensive...since I did get a little bit of a sticker shock when the bill came.  It was a busy night, and they honored 'seating yourself' at the bar. I usually don't mind this option, but I'm not sure if they had assigned servers either. We had multiple servers that came to take our orders and it was a lot more confusing than need be.   All that said, love their Saturday all-day happy hour & trivia night and we'll probably be back.",

    "text": "Recap: the food was pretty decent, they have a good craft beer list, but unfortunately the service was awful.  Let me get this out of the way at the beginning regarding the service. The waiter was very friendly and knowledgable about both the menu and craft beer selection. I wish I got his name because he deserves credit for how hard he was busting his ass. Unfortunately he was the only waiter in the dining room area and no single man could handle that many tables and the device definitely suffered. I put this in the management for not having proper coverage.   We picked this place based on yelp reviews and the \"all day happy hour\".  All day happy hour on a Saturday afternoon? Sold.   The atmosphere is pretty good for a bar and grill. They have the typical beer memorabilia hanging from the walls. It was seat yourself when we arrived and we chose to sit in the dining room. The bar area looked pretty large and had several high table tops to sit at.   The waiter provided us the beer list and we were happy to see so many different craft beers. We all ordered to our likings. Unfortunately the service was slow and the beers were empty and sat empty on our tables prior to getting refilled. I would have drank a few more but time didn't allow.   The food was typical American bar and grill grub. I had a calzone that was surprisingly good. The marinara sauce here is something special. Highly recommend the sauce. I ordered a pepperoni gravy to go with it and it just seemed a weird combination mixed with calzone.   The wings were delish. We had basic buffalo sauce and a firehouse wings. They were well cooked and sauced properly. Appetizers were jalapeno tots and spicy fried pickles. The tots had a pleasant kick of spice but not too much to be unenjoyable. I hate pickles but was told they were mediocre and lacked spice for spicy pickles.   Overall the food was good and the beers were good. I would like to go back again when they have proper staffing levels and would expect my rating to jump up another star ranking.",

The selection of taps is wonderful and ever-changing - in addition they have an iPhone app so you can keep up to date on what's available.  Sweet potato tots are a rare and delicious menu item. The food is a few steps above the standard bar grub. Weirdest thing - the ketchup comes out absurdly cold and sometimes chunky. Are they freezing it??  DO NOT COME HERE ON TRIVIA NIGHTS. It gets surprisingly packed and the staff becomes overwhelmed. Our waitress was incredibly rude about advising someone in our group to watch out for food runners, disappeared for half the night, my group had to pay its bill with one of the bar keeps though I waited for her so I could tip her -- when she returned she had the gull to try to keep my change and ask about the group's payment. Needless to say, SHE WORKED to receive no tip that night.  I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt on this one -- It's too difficult to resist a good reverse happy hour and Boulders sure has a good one.",

    "text": "The food is great, but the service is lousy. Don't go here unless you have a few hours to kill waiting to be seated...or for your order to be taken...or for your check. We are locals, not college students, and this place is within walking distance from our house. We would really love to make this our regular haunt, but after several frustrating attempts to eat & drink here, we've had to find somewhere else to hang out for game night.  Boulders is actually a really nice restaurant and bar with a friendly atmosphere and a fantastic craft beer selection, and the food is inexpensive and fresh and delicious, but we have had service problems soooo many times. We have been there to eat and drink and have waited for a half an hour to be greeted, and several times we have been there and our meal from beginning to end has taken 2-3 hours to complete. Twice we have been denied a table altogether because of Trivia night, and we were turned away.  The wait staff seem to not use the \"section system\", and I surmise that the \"team effort\" system is that everyone is supposed to watch everyone's tables. This may work in some places, but it definitely doesn't work here. Sometimes you seat yourself, sometimes you don't. Sometimes it's marked \"Seat Yourself\", but sometimes it's not. So, you may find yourself standing there for a while wondering what to do while the servers walk past, especially when it's busy. You have to kinda wander around and hope you find a table somewhere. It's a bit awkward, even if you've been there a few times. On one visit, we stood at the host stand for 30 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge us. No one did. I left a note that we had waited, but we were hungry so we were going up the street to a competing establishment. I had hoped that might alert the management that there had been a problem. It didn't...  On another visit, a hostess greeted us, and we were told that it was trivia night and that we couldn't be given a table because people could pretty much stay there all night if they wanted. Instead of having a non-trivia section for regular diners, we were turned away. This happened once in the fall and again in the spring.  On our next visit, the same 30 minute seating wait occurred at the host stand. The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"Are you being helped?\" until finally one of the bartenders was walking past and asked if we were picking up an take-out order. It was then that we found out we were supposed to just go sit down. It was very busy, and we got lucky that we found one table open. However, once we did, we sat at the table for another 30 minutes while no one greeted us or even took a drink order. There were tables with guests all around us, and servers were actively waiting them, but no one ever came to our table. On our way out, someone asked how everything was. We said we didn't know because we'd been there for an hour and had never even been given a menu.   If you DO manage to get a table and get an order placed, make sure that you ask for everything you might need right up front when they bring your food, including anymore drinks. Table check-backs are few and far between, and if you ask for something, chances are your meal will be over before you even get it. We often have to flag someone down to bring us our check, and this is sometimes a half hour to 45 minutes after we've finished eating. This is apparently normal and occurs more often then not. We had some friends meet us there for dinner once. It was somewhat embarrassing to have to ask for a box for his wife just as her meal came because the service had been so slow that she missed her dinner opportunity before she had to leave for work.  The wait staff are very friendly, the owners are great people, and the food and atmosphere is very nice, but it's kind of a pain to eat there, especially if you're hungry or have other things you want to do that night. We really wish we could eat there all the time, which is why we keep going back and trying again and again. We would be in there all the time, at least once a week, but the service continues to be too unpredictable to be able to enjoy the evening. The place does, however, have take-out, which is something that we do when we're in the mood for the food and you want to go get it and bring it back before the game starts. If you get take-out, you may not get beer and hang out, but at least you'll get food and service, plus, it's good for your wallet, since you're not spending nearly as much as you would if you dined in.",

    "text": "I was visiting Tempe for the first time on business, and jumped at the chance of my work colleague, Vince, going out to lunch (just so that I could try the local hangouts); we kind of looked at him funny when he non-chalantly said something 'bout \"boulders\" ...  ...and it's no wonder that not all of us knew what he was talkin' bout, cuz it's pretty discreet-looking, and located in a building that came right out of the 80's. You wouldn't know right off-the-bat if this was a restaurant/bar, and with the interesting name and all, that makes it all the more intriguing.  Being a cyclist myself, I knew it was a good sign when I noticed the interior bike parking! It looks like a pretty cool, laid-back, and non-pretentious atmosphere with younger-gen worker bees and clientele mixed with wood-trim decor, a bar, and TVs in the background.  It wasn't at all deserted, and though not necessarily packed, was fairly full with people, and looked to be a well-known neighborhood hangout, and I thought that this was a good sign.   The menu was fairly descriptive, and made me want to order everything on the menu. It consists of your typical bar-food, but all changed-up with their own special twist.  They had something called the \"Big Freakin' Nacho\" (lightly fried chips topped with mozarella, sausage, olives, and peppers) and upon advice from my colleague, went with the half order (at $7.49) since I heard that they mean business when they say, \"big.\" I ordered this with EXTRA cheese.  I also went with the Costa Rican Cesar. My colleagues ordered other items such as the wings, pizza nuggets, the burger, etc.  The service -   Our waitress was pleasant, took our drink and food order, and all-in-all, the service was relatively quick considering the decent size of our party of 8. She was pretty attentive the whole entire time!  On to the food -   The salad was fairly good, and was a good portion. People can screw up salad, yet what I got was what I'd expect from a place of this genre.  I ordered my nachos with extra cheese, yet they were pretty far from cheesy. In fact, I kind of think that it's the cheese that is the GLUE that holds it together in nachos, so with every bite, I either had nothing but \"chip\", or I had stuff rolling off of it.   Note that I didn NOT complain or send it back because even for a \"half\" portion, it still came out on a pizza tray full of chips, and I pretty much felt like (if I complained), all they were gonna do was just add the cheese and heat up the platter of chips again, which would've made them stale...  Other than this one thing though, the taste formula is pretty right-on, the chips tasted like they were fried in-house, and as the menu described, they tasted light. They could've been so much better though with that extra cheese it needed.  I tried the Pizza Nuggets, and they were good - tasted like pizza sauce and cheese slathered on soft bread. The wings were just so-so (good, but not quite good enough to give me that wow factor).  If I could I'd give this place 3.5 stars; they'd be a 4-star if they somehow stepped up the quality just a tad-bit -   ...they seem to have the right formula going, and their food is unique enough; good enough taste-wise, and large enough portion-wise, yet, in my humble opinion, they need to step it up to make that difference between the thought of \"food just being thrown together\" vs. really going for that wow factor.  ...I'd most-definitely come here agian, though.",

We ordered some late night food - sandwiches, burgers, nachos, sweet potato tots. We all felt like the food was fine, but just fine. Everything could have been a little better. Our friend's burger was ordered med-rare and wasn't really pink at all. The breakfast menu looks pretty promising. I guess we'll have to try some food here during regular meal hours.

    "text": "Boulders sits in an old Old Chicago franchise with some reworking done to make it somewhat bike-oriented. It's in a weird area, on Broadway between Priest and Mill, and a little difficult to find because the sign on Broadway is fairly small. We came for the $5 sandwiches and $3 beer that were advertised on their web site for their all-day Saturday happy hour. When we finally stumbled upon the place, the entrance was fairly hard to find. It's in the back. Upon entering, you find a cavernous, two-story, multi-leveled, dimly lit restaurant with tons of big booths and various separated rooms. Kind of strange. Almost completely empty. I got a look at the menu and immediately realized that the special was actually $6 sandwiches and $3.50 beers on tap. Whatever. The draft selection is a little bit better than you'd find at an Old Chicago location, with some Dogfish Heads, a Rogue and a Ska. They also had a Deschutes red on tap, which I had never had, that wasn't on the menu because it was so new. A lot of the beers are not available for the happy hour prices, such as the aforementioned Dogfish Heads and Ska. So I opted for the Rogue Dead Guy Ale and started looking at the menu. They have quite a bottles selection too, leaving off a lot of the American crap (Bud, Coors, etc.), which I really admire in places, and sticking to the more well-known micros, with a few Four Peaks and that Papago orange stuff to round out the locals. They even had a couple of Nimbuses (Tucson). The bottles were not on special, but I prefer draft beer anyway. The sandwiches and burgers list was a bit more than I had expected. Chicken, turkey, a sirloin (not available as the $6 special) and a couple of veggie options. For sides, they had salads, fries (waffle) and their new, housemade potato chips. I had the southwest turkey with the chips. Those chips are basically thick pieces of potato, lightly fried with a bit of seasoning. They were very good, and I was glad that I got them. The sandwich was nice: deli turkey, cheese and a bit of chipotle sauce for a little kick. My girlfriend got the burger, and I was a bit jealous. It was a rectangular patty on what looked like a ciabatta bun. She said it was one of the best burgers she had in a while and actually finished the thing off, which is really rare for her. Service was good. I felt bad that there were so few people in there, but the guy was really, really nice and attentive. Two beers and the sandwich ended up $13 just for me, which is a pretty good deal when you think about it. Downside is that it's a little dingy inside. They should probably work a bit on cleaning the place up. Maybe get some sort of interior design consultant to come in and revamp the place a bit. Also, the location is just so weird. I've stayed at that Motel 6 across the street years ago, and I never thought I'd opt to spend any additional time in that neighborhood. But I would definitely go back, and would recommend it to those who like their beer. Maybe a good alternative to Four Peaks since they're perpetually packed, although some people may be scared off by the atmosphere here. Give it a chance!",

This is not a college bar, you could run into anyone here, young or old. The food is good, but it is bar food, this is not a gourmet spot, but I love their big freaking nachos and fish n chips. My only particular gripe is the jukebox... the music is either really good or it makes you want to leave... but with the best happy hours in town and friendly atmosphere, it's a very minor complaint. I am here at least every Thursday night with some pals and I don't see that changing any time soon.",

Food is good, bar food....lets get this straight....this isn't a luxury restaurant folks.....If you go frequently, get diner reward card. Honestly...awesome. I love supporting local businesses and I'm so glad they support their local breweries. I get intense cravings for this place frequently. Will certainly be back, again and again!",

Started by avid rock climbers who used to be employed at the restaurant that formerly occupied the business space, this place is a Tempe gem.   Delicious food, a large drink selection, great happy hour prices, daily specials, and one of my favorite things to do while the night is young on Saturdays--Trivia.  Grab a group of friends, pick a horribly offensive team name, and get ready to play TRIVIA with some of Tempe's... smartest? Er-- People with as much useless random knowledge as you.  My only gripe is that this place can get HOT during the summertime depending on what area of the bar you're in. But hey, this is Arizona, you should expect this anywhere you go.",

    "text": "I would've never stepped foot into this place if I were to judge it by its exterior alone. It looks like it could serve as the location shot for a post-apocalyptic prison planet sci-fi film. Just a big ol' concrete box sitting on a patch of asphalt, with no indication of life inside. But maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic.  Upon entering I was greeted with all the coziness of a comfortable college beer bar. You can tell they take beer here seriously from all of the bric-a-brac on the walls and the selection of tap handles. My inaugural visit to this fine watering hole was incited by a meetup with fellow beer lovers, the occasion being a beer tasting and learn-in conducted by a visiting beer scholar from Odell Brewing Company. I was late so I didn't join in the beer class, so I plunked down my happy ass with my fellow beer fans, and resolved to do my studying by osmosis. I ordered a delicious Odell Myrcenary Double IPA which satisfied my inner beer baby.  All this quaffing, and joking, and jostling, and elbowing of the ribs (and things of this nature) made me hungry for the local fare. I decided I would sample the wings here. I was not disappointed! The wings they served me were more of a dry variety. This makes for a very crispy wing, which is KEY, so they definitely get points for that. As for the Jamaican Jerk wings, there was no sauce, but a generous dusting of spices that were both elusive and delicious (I'm almost certain I detected ginger and allspice). I also ordered their Smokin' Jalapeno Firehouse wings... which I thought at first would be too spicy. The cornerstone of this slightly wetter spice treatment is a rub made of red jalapeno peppers. Despite my fear, I dove in, ignoring the flames of Hell engulfing me, and got down-and-dirty with those tasty winglets. These wings are good!! And since they're drier than most, they are perfectly suited for generous dipping in ranch or blue cheese. There's also something suspiciously crack-like about the blue cheese dressing here... it is otherworldly!  This place is the perfect escape from the drudgery of the wage slave work week.  Throw off the shackles, ignore both moons that are glowing purple, and hunker down here with your fellow inmates for some great beer and some amazing wings.",

Came to watch football playoffs and there was barely any volume so I was able to hear the table behind me chew their food. Seemed like a lot of regulars. Good beers on tap was the only redeeming factor I could find. I ordered the \"Tangy Buffalo\" style of their \"Best Wings\" it came out and I had to send them back because I didn't think there was anything on them except for a pool of grease under them. When they came back they were just a little more doused in greased \"sauce\" than the last but just as flavorless. The waitress did not not seem to care in the least. These were worse than Hooters mild sauce. They need to shape up but because of the good draft lineup I may give them a second chance.",

Good beer selection, but no listing of brews on tap and too many for our waitress to remember. She recommended a seasonal brew that sounded good, and was, but 10% ABV! Print out a beer list that at least shows alcohol content, brewery, and style of beer! Ordered a pizza. Ugh mistake, $17 for a 12 inch with doughy crust and what looked and tasted like a cut up hot dog as sausage. The happy hour burger deal was excellent however and the burgers were quite good. Just having a listing of their beers would get them another star.",

I would say Thursdays at Boulders are the best... 1/2 off almost all bottles of beer!  *But make sure you look at your tab because the bartender forgot to take of the 50% at first*  It is quite packed with a college crowd but falls into the lines of a 'Casey Moores' more than Mill Ave etc.    Have really great Trivia there on Tuesdays! Its a big place with ample seating and cheap drinks but the best part is that you can bring dogs on the outside patio.  I don't know any other bar that allows dogs on their patio! Its fantastic!

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo. Good choice on our behalf!   We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.  I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a \"Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter\" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up!   Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.   Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone.   If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out! I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their \"team trivia nights\" soon - sounds like a blast.",

Over that time, my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there, who always remembered our names, our favorite dishes, and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive, ever changing list.  In the past year or so, however, this place has gone downhill fast.  The online beer list never matches the beers on the chalkboard, so it's hard to order without checking with your server about what's ACTUALLY going to be on tap.  They also no longer have prices posted, so more than once I have been surprised by ordering a \"premium\" beer when no indication of this was given on the menu.  Unfortunately, in our past 3 visits, we've sat for 15-20 minutes before actually being visited by a server.  On one occasion this summer, I found a fly in my salad.  Their employee turnover has also been unreasonably high as of late...gone are those friendly servers who remembered our names and made us feel welcome.  In the past year, we've had a different server on every visit, and every time they seemed brand new (didn't know the beer list, forgetting our order, etc.).  The final straw was that in our last two visits, the servers have been not only incompetent but downright rude, even insulting people at our table to our faces.  Sorry Boulders...based on our history, I've given you too many chances.  No more.",

We have driven by this rather ho-hum restaurant countless times, but never thought to venture in (driving by you really would have no idea what kind of restaurant/bar/pub this might be!). Came across a Groupon and decided to give it a shot. Good decision!  We went at about 5:30pm on a Saturday and the place was about half-way full (more so in the bar compared to the \"dining room\").  Walk in, the sign says to seat yourself so we opted for a booth near a wall/window. Here's some advice:  Don't just plunk down in the booth, the seats could use a little TLC- they were rather hard!    Super chill and knowledgable staff; our waiter had great suggestions (we took his advice).  Started with a bruschetta appetizer (pesto, diced chicken, Gouda, basil, fresh tomatoes), which was hella tasty!  Margaritas were perfect blend of flavor and tequila, one is plenty for dinner unless you want to get tossed at 6pm. Followed up with the Moose Drool burger (did I mention that Saturdays are $6 burger or sandwich days, and includes one side?!?) which is a beef burger with provolone, fried onion strings, fried jalapenos and a jalapeno cream cheese.  Yum!    Still had some money to spend so we got their version of a pazookie, which was basically a very greasy, yet somehow still tasty, 9\" freshly-baked cookie.   Bill came to $30, cheap!  Great place, REALLY great value on Saturdays!  Definitely recommend this place.",

It was a quiet morning, but probably just because it was the first game. It has definitely picked up since then.  Justin, the Manager, was kind enough to lure us back with an offer to try the California Carver pizza. Hooked! ! Comes with a spicy southwest sauce, turkey, pepper jack & mozzarella, then topped with pico, avocado & crisp onion strings. You won't be sorry you tried it. We went back the following week and ordered the same thing!  We've gone back a couple times now and it feels like we're visiting with old friends when we come in. Justin, the bartender, is a riot and knows how to keep his customers smiling even when he's got a full bar - plus it helps he's also rooting for DaBears!   The service really has been excellent, everyone is on top of things and makes sure we have everything we need. They probably don't remember this, but I also hosted a dinner for my Meetup group in the private room upstairs a few months ago, and we had great service then too. I was just so busy entertaining, that I didn't get a chance to really talk to the staff that night...but we'll probably host another event here soon!

I came here with a group for Trivia Night and had a fun time playing with them while enjoying Happy Hour beers and sharing appetizers. I'm a huge fan of stouts, so I was glad to see more than just 1 or 2 stouts on tap; I opted for the Boulders Chocolate Shake stout and was very pleased!   We got a plate of nachos, french fries, jalapeno poppers, and something called Italian Nachos. Essentially, they were pita-like chips served with pizza toppings and red sauce. They were interesting and tasted good, but I can't say that I would get them again. To each their own!   Overall, it was a nice and laid-back environment for catching up with friends.",

The half off appetizers were great but the wings I got were just so-so. The selection of craft beers was latger than Iwas expecting.  Since I am new to the region I was unfamiliar with most of them. Unfortunately it was a work night so I couldn't really experiment. The brombere I had was worth a try if you like sour beers.   I would be willing to come back with friends to hang out and grab a beer if we're in the area.  Most likely wouldn't go out of my way to swing by though.",

    "text": "Okay, I love this place. And it's not just because it's where I met my fiance 3 years ago lol  This place is sorcery. A melting pot of so many different concepts that you wouldn't think work together, but strangely, just do.  Boulders is awesome for people of all ages, and that's a really delicate and impossible to maintain balance you won't see elsewhere. Young people, middle aged people, some seniors, the occasional child... It may sound like a mess but it truly just works. And when you're here, youre so busy enjoying yourself you forget the people around you. What I'm saying is unless you're looking for a clubby scene, this place is for anyone and everyone, and is a great place to meet new people, make interesting conversations with strangers, and leave with new friends.  Boulders has Atmosphere with a capital A. Not quite divey, kind of like a lodge sort of feel, like something you would find up in flagstaff. It's also somewhere you can go in jeans and a t-shirt and feel fine about that, or if you wanna dress swanky chic with a full face, it just works.. They also cater alot to outdoorsy vocations like biking, climbing, etc. For example, there's a bike bar inside. Evenings and weekends are great! They have trivia night, which is always well-attended and a great time. Friday's and weekends have a nice comfortably busy volume, and weeknights still have a comfortable amount of people.  They have private \"party\" rooms, all kinds of different types of sections and seating, and a huge private loft great for get togethers and casual events and parties.  They do events which are super cool and fun, the bartenders and servers dress up for Halloween, tour de fat, and other occasions.  They also have tons of games behind the bar, which is a fun an whimsical touch. Things like jenga, monopoly, battleship, etc. Heck yeah, fun hahahaha Their patio is great for just hanging out with friends, talking and relaxing over some great drinks and food. It has an art Deco fire pit, bags, misters, mood lighting, and plenty of seating with umbrellas and space heaters in the winter. Patio is smoker AND dog friendly!  The drinks are great, the constantly changing beer selection is expansive, impressive, and well priced. I guarantee, Boulders has something for every taste, from the cider fanatic like me, to the beer snob. Mixed drinks are great, too! Cheap, strong, and delicious.  The food is sooooooo stinkin good. Pizzas are huge, full of toppings, and delicious. (can I recommend the Chuck Norris double deckered with the California carver?!) Oh man, and their waffle fries and bar foods? So. Good.  They also have tvs all over with various games on, and movie nights, yet somehow that doesn't detract from the \"Lodge feel\" sorcery!  They have a special brunch menu on weekends, with, get ready, phenomenal house recipe bloody Mary's from scratch, no cheap mix here, friend! Don't be thrown off by the dated looking brunch menu, it's looks that way for a reason: the breakfast foods are delicious and have lasted the years.  Last thing, the STAFF IS AMAAAAAAZING. When you come here more than a few times, you feel like family. They see you, know you, remember you. They will shoot the moo poo with you, and it's not unusual to make friends with them outside of Boulders, because they're just cool people. And let me ask you, how many bars do you know of with an ever changing beer list that see you walk in, and based off your past selections and knowing what you like, will have your beer waiting for you when you get to the bar? And even more, it's something you haven't tried before but LOVE? That is Boulders service. Like the aforementioned cider aficionado? That's me. I'm also a wierdo and drink anything carbonated through a straw, beer and cider included. I walk up to the bar and if they arent already filling my glass before popping in my requisite straw, it's there waiting with straw dancing in the bubbles. When I bring new people and we sit inside, I don't have to even say my order they always smile and say whatever the current cider best suited to me is. I know I've waxed eternal on anticipated orders and ciders with straws, but you just don't find that anywhere. A few months ago, I came in one night after receiving 2 extractions, 7 fillings, and, same day, got braces. Yes I'm insane. Deal with it lol moving along, I was ravenous, but in a hell of a lot of pain and couldn't eat. My server (shout out to you Addya!) brought me soup and an amazing assortment of things she thought I could eat. Things like pineapple, olives, cooled soft cooked chicken, various pizza toppings, etc. Not gonna lie, I cried. But that's just how the staff here is. They're awesome.   This place is life, and I will be a patron til this business ceases to exist.",

Service was friendly, although our waitress wasn't overly knowledgable about their beer selection.   You MUST get the nachos. OMG - so delicious. The chips must be deep fried so they're almost like wantons. SO good!! The pizza wasn't that great, doughy, so I'd try something different next time/wouldn't recommend that. They have waffle fries and tots to choose from! Burgers looked good, same with the sandwiches. LOTS of menu choices so you won't go hungry :-)",

Food is mediocre at best. Service is awful.   My first time there was for a beer event that was very busy and service was lousy. I chalked it up to the event stretching everyone thin.   Came back on a normal night where it wasn't nearly as packed and watched servers stand around neglecting tables all night. Food was cold, but the beer was too.  Came back a few times for rare beers and had the same experience. Today was the last time I think I'll come in even for the special tapings. The manager or owner (don't know which but he is always there) was extremely rude to me when filling my beer and I can only assume it was because I was purchasing a full beer instead of taking part in the beer festival event they had going on at the time. I guess my money for the beer wasn't enough compared to the other patrons.",

It's happened twice in the past two years and I hoped it was just a one off, but I am convinced they do not know how to cater to large groups.  We went in on a Saturday around noon.  Both times we had around 12 people.  The issue is that it takes so long for the food to come, and it comes spaced apart for everyone.  The times between food coming out should not be greater than a half hour!  We are trying to dine as a group.  Also, it should not take over two hours for any lunch.  Also, there was a problem with a sandwich having coleslaw on it so it was sent back.  We had to ask the waitress where the order was because I think they just forgot to bring it back.  When it came back it was obvious they just scraped off the coleslaw!  The their benefit, they did remove that item from the bill.  I normally love this place for food and great beer but don't think I will ever attempt to bring my large group again.",

Came in late evening on a Sunday, was able to seat ourselves in a spacious booth in a more quite corner of the pud, and was promptly greeted by our server.   The place was clean, well-lit (but not oppressively so), and the atmosphere was positive and upbeat. I loved how happy everyone was, and it was clearly a place for having a good time.   Our server was hilarious (almost crying at a couple of points) and he definitely made the night extra memorable. He was quick to top off our water, and made sure we were taken care of without being obnoxious. Kudos.  The food was excellent, making this my new favorite late-night stop for good ol' fashioned bar food. My wife and I split their Nachos Grande and it was amazing. Generous portion size, with all of the favorite toppings. They were baked in the oven to perfection and we scarfed them down with the help of our friend without even looking up.   I ordered the Elvis Calzone and was impressed. Cooked to a perfect golden brown, and stuffed with mozzerella, red bell peppers, and capers (normally comes with canadian bacon but I took the vegetarian route). Came with a huge side of house marina and it was hands down one of the best calzones I have ever had. Must try for calzone lovers.   Their beer list was staggeringly large, with every name you can imagine on it, and I was told that it changes daily. I wasn't drinking, so I didn't get to try any of the great selections, but it is definitely the place to be for those looking to try a new brew!!  Over all this place has great food, great service, and a killer atmosphere that makes a five star stop for anyone looking for an exceptional pub experience.",

We got sat right next to the kitchen and waited ten minutes for a server, it didn't seem that busy even though there were some tables playing trivia, it wasn't overwhelming. We ordered and it was just bar food, not awful but nothing great. It took probably 25-30 minutes to get our food though. We only ordered three appetizers, that probably don't take that long to make. The trivia was fun, but I saw people using their cellphones answers and that was kind of lame. I don't know if I'll be back here, it just wasn't as fun as I thought it would be.",

They overdress the hell out of their salads to the point that it's soupy.   The service is generally good in the bar area; but that's what happens when you become a barfly I guess...they're nice to the regulars.  They have a largish outdoor seating area where you can smoke.   They have a great happy hour.  There is always an eclectic group of customers.  I've met some good peeps here.

    "text": "I don't have much bad to say about Boulder's but since there isn't an ability to give a fractional star this place gets 5.  Honestly the beer selection on it's own would be enough to get 5 stars for me.  Between the rotating draft beer selection and the bottle/can list there's pretty much something for every taste.  The bar staff is knowledgeable when it comes to what they have, especially Justin, Dave, and Alex, so if you want a recommendation they won't point you in the wrong direction.  The bar is fairly laid back most of the time but can get rowdy during ASU games.  It's more of a neighborhood bar than a sports bar so there aren't a ton of tv's, but they do open early on the weekends (9 or 10am) so people do come in for early morning soccer some times.  They run different specials pretty much every day of the week.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from their food menu.  Usually I'll go with a burger and while they are all good, for my preference I usually go for the Asian Bob with a Ceasar Salad instead of the waffle fries.  The Bombay Street Dog was at one point a summer only item which has found a permant place on the menu after appearing in Phoenix New Times article \"Our 10 Favorite Spicy Dishes in Metro Phoenix\" last year.  If you are there for breakfast, everything I've had is good.  My recommendation would be the Chuck Norris Scramble and a Bloody Mary (it has bacon in it).",

    "text": "Given that my friends and I come here on a near weekly basis to play Team Trivia, I figured it was about time to write a review.  While I have some tiny issues with the place, they never matter much since I always end up having a blast here.    There are TONS of different varieties of beer available in bottles, cans, or on draft.  Perfect for beer snobs and craft beer noobs alike.  Even if you're like me and pretty much get the same thing (Ranger IPA!) every time, there are still lots of options if you decide you want to mix it up.  Plus, the happy hour prices rock.  Food is your typical bar fare.  Fried appetizers, burgers, and pizza.  I haven't tried the pizza yet, but I've enjoyed the burgers I've had.  On Saturdays, the burgers are $6 which is a smokin' deal, considering that one burger could probably feed two people, plus you also get a side salad or fries.  The guacamole appetizer is fantastic as well.  Great for sharing.  Now for the main draw, trivia!!!  Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, Boulders has Team Trivia games, which are fantastically fun.  If people don't cheat, that is.  My friends and I have won twice so far (winners get a $20 gift certificate for their next visit.)  Never fear if you're not the ultimate champions- second place and third place get $15 and $10 giftcards respectively.  It's always amusing to hear other team names with pop culture references and profanity peppered in.  The teensy negatives:  What's up with the A/C??  The last few times I've visited, it's been just stiflingly hot inside.  It hasn't been enough to ruin the fun, but it's definitely a bit irksome to sweat inside in the summer.  Service can also be slow at times but this is mainly when there are 30 trivia playing teams, so I understand the delay.  Generally, even when it's busy, the servers are awesome and do their best to get your orders to you quickly.",

The first item - Pine Nut Blue Cheese Salad - mix of organic spinach and green leaf lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, pine nuts, blue cheese crumbles and freshly tossed with pear vinaigrette. This salad included very few vegetables other than the lettuce, the blue cheese was sparse and the vinaigrette was bottled and bland. My main course - Build Your Own 'Zone - Choose three toppings plus melted mozzarella and ricotta cheeses. I ordered a vegetarian (mushroom, artichoke, spinach) Calzone but when I went to take my first bite I got CHICKEN. I called Boulders on Broadway and they apologized and said they would send a new item. I got a call back about 15 minutes later letting me know it would be 2 hours before they could deliver my new order. It was already late so I just asked for a refund to my credit card. I was told this would take at least a month. After asking to talk to a manager I finally got a refund to my credit card the next day. Lots of $$ for an average salad that cost a delivery charge, delivery tip and fees.",

A quick Yelp search put this place at the top of our list.    Parking was packed.  I had to park in the lot next door.  There were several folks on the patio. As we walked in we were greeted by a large indoor bike rack.  Pretty neat! We claimed 2 empty seats at the bar and the server let us know that they had Happy Hour all day during the weekend, the beers with the * were $1 off and sandwiches were $6.  Ohhh nice deal!   As we looked through the menu we also noticed they offer all you can eat 1-topping pizza for $7 on Sundays. We agreed we needed to come back on a Sunday to check this place out.  Once we realized they also do Pub Trivia nights we also agreed we needed to come back for that too.  In fact much of the crowd on this night was here for the Pub Trivia so much so that within an hour after it was over this place emptied by more than half.   The food and service were quality.  We decided to split the honey chicken sandwich with waffle fries.  A little cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. The chicken breast was grilled and was thick and moist.  The 2 of us with 2 good beers each and sharing a sandwich came out to about $30 including tip.",

    "text": "Beer. Bicycles. Food. The three essentials to Boulders on Broadway:  Ride a bike and have no worry about it being stolen as you can bring it inside to their spacious bike racks. Most of the employees ride bikes as well, so feel free to strike up conversation about cycling. On that note, all of the employees are friendly and (usually) prompt on drinks/ordering/etc, when it's busy sometimes there is a delay but that's standard for most businesses. Especially neighborhood places.  Lots of tap beers (12+) and even more bottles/cans in the cooler. Fans of Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head and other distributed craft brewing brands will be pleased to see their selection. The taps and stock changed semi-frequently but not enough that you won't have something to like week to week.  There are a few bland selections on the menu and other things that are very good. I can attest to anything \"Southwest\" on the menu being delicious, I usually go for the Southwest Quesadilla (which you can get veggie). Their pizzas are above average, we're not talking LGO, Cibo or Bianco quality, but they are worth a shot if that's your craving. My friend likes the Pepperoni Wheels, I find them a bit oily while still being good. One item I found lacking was the \"Turkey Sandwich\" and the regular nacho plate didn't impress either. They were both below average but not the worst I've ever had.  They have good specials throughout the week, with my favorites being Monday (1/2 price pizza), Tuesday (1/2 price apps) and Thursday (1/2 price select bottles, one each, as to get people to drink different beers).",

    "text": "I give Bonnie G full credit for me reviewing this place, for there'd be no way in hell I'd have seen it or known about it otherwise. I'm trying to remember why we went. Somehow I was in Tempe. Bonnie was in Tempe. Why were we both in Tempe? Who knows. You don't care either way.  The point is, walking into Boulders was a little bizarre. It's completely out of place for the area. More like an old college institution you'd find in Chico or Corvallis. Or maybe even Flag. Big, huge, bike-friendly wooden ski lodge. Upstairs loft with pool-table overlooking the bar/restaurant below. It is pretty much the quintessential neighborhood hangout. No scene. No pretense. No slathering your fake-n-bake and hair gel to mack on Landon and Tiffany. Extremely casual and everyone's friendly - from the owner to all the other patrons.   And did I mention the beer? An impressive selection of microbrews on tap, many of which I'd never heard of. But the owner took the time to describe each one, and I ended up with a few pints of a really great stout (Bonnie was quite taken with her brew as well). The beers regularly rotate, so there's always something new to try.  And sure, there is mostly noise coming out of the jukebox, but I didn't really care. It's not like I was expecting to hear some European DJ who has at least one umlaut in his name and wears wraparound shades even while he's spinning in a pitch black nightclub. You're here for the conversation (unless you're a Woo Girl).  So all in all, I really dug this Boulders, in all its sheer normalness. We all need a place like this: a super-casual neighborhood bar which requires the least amount of effort from you. Sitting on your living room couch and feel like having a beer with a friend without needing to put on \"going out\" attire and \"going out\" attitude? This is it. Your shoulders are down. You're chilled out. And you're probably discovering a new favorite beer in the process.  4 stars.",

    "text": "\"White chocolate-flavored beer?\"  Those were the last words I said before falling in love.  The thing is, I don't even like white chocolate.  But, as a beer, my tastebuds and my stomach were transported to the closest thing on Earth that could be referred to as Heaven.  I'm exaggerating, but not very much.  It's like saying, \"A gajillion!\" when the actual number is 753 quadrillion.  Their other beers are great, too.  You can always ask, \"Hey, what's new here?\" and they'll go through an exhaustive list.  Ask them what their new favorite is and you'll get something amazing.  The food is not only nothing special, I don't even recommend going there with food in mind.  It's not terrible but it's really just not that good.  They have a chicken pesto sandwich that's alright, but generally, I would say, come here after you already ate and stick to beer.  The service is great.  They're always, always as nice as can be without being Ned Flanders about it.  If I ever saw someone being a dick to one of the help, I'd probably lose my shit and go Tony Soprano on 'em.  I saw Barack Obama's acceptance speech here, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Palin and the first half of the Super Bowl.  This is sort of like my second home, only maybe a little bit better because there's more than one toilet.",

I guess this place is a decent place to go once to check it out, I can't say I would bother going again. I guess between the extremely bright lights, and eclectic ski lodgian decor, it just doesn't tickle my fancy.  (if I even had a fancy)   My date and I relived some moments of our past and played a challenging game of pool, similar to when we first met. We had some drinks, and played reindeer games, and chatted and joked. No doubt it was a great time. I guess atmosphere has become even more important for me lately, even if the beer selection is wide ranging and the prices are excellent. This place definitely screams \" I make great pizza, I swear!\" It seems like you could potential get a good pizza pie here, even if it looks as if Vale Colorado vomited inside this place.  Colorado is not known for it's pizza, so I am not sure if I can trust it.   Overall Boulders gets a 3 because of the beer selection, that aside it is a low 2 rating.",

    "text": "A ski-lodgey pizzeria. This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit \"weird\" and \"puzzling,\" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.  Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?  DINNER:  Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered \"All Day Happy Hour,\" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their \"Half and Half.\" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time.   My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that.   Overall, the food is average \"bar style\" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options.   JUST DRINKS:  Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)  As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap!   Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle.   SO WHY GO?  Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)  If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!",

Tap selections good though, and the craft beer enthusiast will be happy here.  It's always great to see Dogfish Head on tap (90 minute).  It has a dive feel to it inside, as it is often rather dark and gloomy in feel.  Seems to have a few regular alcoholics too, but what local bar doesn't?",
