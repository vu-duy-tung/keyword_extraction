    "text": "I never am one to complain openly about an experience at a restaurant but felt compelled to share ours.  We were a group of 7 on a Tuesday night. Waited maybe 15 minutes for our table...no big deal.   The service was by far the worst part of our dining experience. Sever brought water, but failed to ask for additional drinks. Appetizers came out rather quickly and we're delicious (fried mozzarella), but the server took our orders and seemed to disappear. I had to ask a different server for another beer.   When the food finally came everyone received their food except for me. Also, our salads arrived with the pizzas instead of being brought out prior, maybe this is a standard for the restaurant, but odd nonetheless.   My food arrived just about the time everyone was finished.  Pizza (montanerro) was good, I wouldn't say worth the wait.   Finally, when it was time to pay the bill it took over 45 minutes once the server took our cards (7 different checks). The server ended up losing one of our cards in the 10ft walk between our table the POS. The card hasn't been found and ended up had to be canceled through the bank.   Food was good, but not worth the terrible service.",

    "text": "Downtown Phoenix. Saturday. Comicon was on. We needed good food within a few blocks of the convention center.   I have eaten at La Piazza al Forno in downtown Glendale so I knew these people could make good pizza. We arrived at Locale soon after they opened at 2pm, and the place was hoppin'. I was part of a party of three, which ended up perfect: a pizza bianca split three ways, plus different side salads for each of us.  I had the rucola salad; I was impressed with the size of the salad, and the dressing and arugula were delicious together.  Now, to the pizza. Imagine a vat of divine cheese. Fling your tastebuds into that. That's the bianca. Their crust isn't my favorite, I confess, but it's still yummy, and that fresh cheese is soooo good.   Plus, delightful air conditioning (me wearing a steampunk costume in 110-degree heat was not the smartest of ideas) and a server who was willing to constantly refill our water glasses... coming here was the perfect choice. Plus, I got to show some out-of-town friends that Phoenix has some darn delicious pizza.",

The ingredients seemed fresh and the makings of a good pizza are there, but the execution by the kitchen staff was abysmal and sloppy. The ratio of ingredients was off with too little cheese and too much sauce on a soggy crust (that wasn't at all crusty). It was like eating bread and pizza sauce. The kitchen staff were also very unprofessional. He didn't wash his hand before making food after hanging out talking on the phone and filling out paperwork in the dining area. There was a stray meatball on my non-meat pizza further showing the sloppiness of the kitchen staff. Will not return.",

If I had to choose my favorite pizza it would be Locale.  Why you ask?  Their crust.  It has the perfect texture smooth and chewy inside with a crisp exterior specked with just the right amount of char to add a smokey flavor.  The dough is not tough and overworked like a few places plus it has the right balance of salt and sweetness.  My second favorite thing is the red sauce.  The tomato flavor in the sauce is simple perfection.  My mom grows and home cans her own San Marzano tomatoes so I can be a bit particular about the flavor when someone says they are using these in their sauce.    I can not speak to the sit down service as I have only ever ordered carry out which is super quick and too easy when the last thing I want to do is cook after work.",

I couldn't believe I could be surprised by pizza, an item I've had millions of times, but not like this one.  The dough, incredible. It tastes fresh, like my grandmother hand rolled it in the back there. The sauce, amazing. You could taste each ingredient in it and it was as fresh as picking a tomato and taking a bite right out of it.  I don't know what else to say, other than the food is phenomenal.

Both were freshly made and brought out. Very good meats, the ham was thin and not overpowering.  The cheeses were perfectly blended and worked well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because our server seemed a bit off and gave us a strange vibe. Otherwise very good pizza. I wouldn't recommend for huge groups. The pizzas are just enough for 2 people.",

Without the side of tangy marinara sauce that I asked for, the pie would have been bland and not worthy.  Desserts looked okay. If you like italian sweets, order a cannoli. It's large (about 6\") for five bucks. The tiramisu is rather expensive. A small portion will set you back $8.",

Finally, we approached someone and he said he will get a table ready for us in the back (despite the open tables in the front that were ready). He then comes back and says, \"just to let you know we are no longer making pizzas.\" Uhhh. Okay?  You close in one hour.  You have a restaurant FULL of people.  It takes 15 mins tops to make a pizza.   I call bullshit. I call racism. Your staff is disgusting as is your service.   **UPDATE**  Someone from the restaurant messaged me regarding the review and stated that they were out of pizza dough and that's why they couldn't accommodate us. If that were the case, why didn't that guy just say that instead of \"we are no longer making pizzas\"? Those are two completely different statements. I rest my case.",

    "text": "Authentic, FANTASTIC pizza.  Brick oven - feels like I'm in Italy, including the menu terms/items, which I think could be updated to allow guests to more readily understand what's being offered. The descriptions certainly suffice but at first glance wer couldn't figure out what exactly it is we were looking at. It was well worth the trouble and I wouldn't go anywhere else in town after trying this. The only other notable is that the decor is a little bit below the quality level of the food. Meaning, it's a very high level of freshness and taste, complete with olive oil and the like, but the atmosphere is a little bit relaxed, which is fine for most but somewhat deceiving at first.  Big portions on the personal Pizza, enough to satisfy my teenage son, which is a feat in an of itself. Highly recommend this place!",

Pizza was absolutely delicious and perfectly sized for sharing (also could have easily eaten one to myself). Flavors were simple & delicious. The only thing I would have changed was the crust, which seemed a tiny bit underdone towards the middle--still tasted excellent!     Service: was quick & friendly! Our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful when we were trying to decide!     Ambiance: I loved that the restaurant was not too dark and didn't play the music too loudly, it allowed for easy conversation without shouting over the background.         Would absolutely return to try some more dishes!",

Unfortunately, it was nothing to write home about; it was just okay. The sauce lacked flavor and was surprisingly thin...best way I can describe my initial thoughts after tasting it is that it was similar to the flavor and consistency you'd remember from the canned Chef Boyarde spaghetti-O's you ate when you were 5.  The pizza dough however was tasty and I liked the fresh garlic and basil on top. It couldn't mask the disappointing sauce, but it helped. Would I recommend this place based on what I had? Probably not. Although other items on the menu may be good, this one just did not hit the spot.",

From what I understand the wood fire pizza oven is imported from Italy by way of New York.  It was formerly used in one of Mario Batali's restaurants.  The sauce, meets and cheeses are fantastic and if you love authentic Italian pizza as much as I do you need to check this place out.  The service is good.  Of course at lunch it can be busy but the service is good.  They do not want you to wait but know the food is good so you should. Chef-Owner, Justin Piazza, assured us he would secure a table for us quickly despite the heavy Friday lunch crowd.  Thank goodness my friends faces are regulars, he came out of the kitchen to greet us. I had the Montanara, and it was so good. My friend had the Italian Stallion and it was also fantastic, great for meat lovers.  I would like to go back and seriously, try one of everything on the menu.   They intend to add outdoor seating with a railed patio that runs the store front which will be nice.",

    "text": "Ingredients. La Piazza PHX has the best ingredients over any other competitor. First we started off with Angioletti Fritti and the Foccacia. Both were delicious. For the main course we ordered Lasagne Ah' Pizz. The tomatoes really stood out. Ricotta is my favorite ingredient to add to a pizza, but even the tomatoes stood out over the ricotta. They were definitely imported tomatoes. We are talking DOP standards here. Nothing but the best.  The restaurant is small so you might miss it. You will not want to attempt to park in a parking garage like we did. Instead they have parking right in front of the restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and made some good food suggestions.  I am not a big fan of soda in a glass bottle at restaurants because 99% of the time it is and has been expired for a while which makes it tasteless. I would definitely go back and would strongly suggest over Pizzeria Bianco. It is much easier to get into, tastes better and isn't cramped inside like PB.",

    "text": "Their food here is really good. Pizza is the best I have had in Phoenix. However, this restaurant couldn't care less regarding the comfort of their customers in here. There was a large gangster group of people dining here tonight. Walking in loudly and not once simmering down until their food came. The chattiness of the group wasn't the issue tho, as many places have that loud table. The large group found the restaurant's choice of music playing not their taste and proceeded to blast (yes blast on a fucking speaker they brought in) their ghetto rap music for the whole restaurant to hear. There were two couples and a few single diners there with me, who looked with disgust to this group's lack of manners. This by no means was an offense to the restaurant. But how the waitress working tonight handled the situation I was utterly befuddled! The music blasted for a good 10 mins before I proceeded out of the restaurant. How long it continued I do not know. But the whole duration I was there I witnessed the waitress apologizing to each table she went to and then sing along with two of the songs being blasted over the music that was already playing in the background! Not only did she not ask them to at least turn it down, but she was joining in on the party. It sounded like a fucking nightclub in there. An older man walked up and then out during this time, I'm assuming because of the loud gangster rap. I don't know... Maybe the waitress was friends with these people. As she proceeded to take several pictures for the group and did not once acknowledge the fact that 1) the music was completely inappropriate for a public restaurant and 2) was so loud no conversation could have been had. I dine out a lot and I can honestly say that I have never been in a restaurant setting where a situation like this could have been handled more poorly. I will be taking my business to the Glendale location instead until they hire a staff that has more respect and manners for their customers.",

    "text": "I've been to the old Glendale location a few times and have now been here now 3 times, and this place just keeps getting better every time I visit. There's one waiter I get every time, and he always gives me great recommendations on new things to try or old favorites I might have missed. My favorite pizza with toppings (possibly of all time, competing with the similar \"Zoli\" at Il Cane Rosso in Dallas) is the Italian Stallion, and the last time I went he also suggested the Montanara which is effectively a margherita pizza but they take the dough and flash fry it before putting on the toppings and then tossing it in the brick oven to finish. Now I have to order both or I feel like I'm missing out! Their calamari is great as well as the burratta for appetizers (ask for focaccia to go with the burratta), and they usually have some sort of delicious dessert that involves Nutella to finish it all off. Since it's not their fault, I can't take anything away from them for this, but since it's downtown Phoenix parking can be a little challenging. For some places I wouldn't bother, but La Piazza PHX is always well worth the trip.   P.S. It's also deservedly the New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" Best Gourmet Pizza 2014: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phoenixnewtimes.com%2Fbestof%2F2014%2Faward%2Fbest-gourmet-pizza-4454001%2F&s=b4e5b1ab20689685205dbff76484c76a98fd6ec20854a05f076e168a2aecc5b3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phoenixnewtimes.com/best...</a>",

Spinach, bacon, goat cheese, and dressing. I dunno...cranberries or differing would have been nice.  Also if you're going to serve \"Italian soda\" it should probably be pointed out on the menu or at least when ordering that it is in fact a can of soda from an Italy and not a traditional Italian soda with cream and such. And $2.50 for a can of misleading soda? Please. Our whole group was disappointed and sent them back.   There most irritating thing though was the broken speaker. They had loud music playing over an extremely staticy speaker which kept jumping the volume up and down and annoying everyone there. I'm curious how long that problem has been going on.  The 7 year old seating tables was a nice touch though. That was cute.  But still. Grumble grumble.",

We had been waffling between going here and going to Pomo, but decided to go here because it was closer and we figured they would be about the same. When we got here, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The service was prompt and friendly. We decided to just get two items here and cut out the last place on our crawl. We ordered the arancini and the fried pizza. The arancini sounded really good..... but it was really bad. It was not cooked enough, the cheese in the middle wasn't melted at all...still cubes. The meat was in one clump, not mixed into the risotto as I would have thought. The frying oil may not have been hot enough because the arancini tasted like it was just full of oil.... pretty gross. We did eat it anyway as we spent 8$ on it, but I would not recommend it to anyone. Then our pizza came. Again, wasn't cooked long enough. Really? The cheese wasn't melted. Did they not see that? The sauce was cold and tasted like the can. The fried dough was, again, way too oily, probably because the oil wasn't hot enough. It was like a bland greasy doughnut with unmelted cheese and can tasting tomatoes on top. So gross. I took most of it to go and gave it to a homeless person. That plus a couple of beers was like 45- 50$....what a huge waste of money. Will not be back.",

We got the fried mozzarella appetizer, and it was SO GOOD. We were expecting mozzarella sticks but it was more like mozzarella squares. The cheese was great. My pasta was good, but I tried one of my coworkers pieces of pizza and the pizza was EXCELLENT. So much better, and I would definitely order pizza instead if I ever go back.

    "text": "La Piazza is another pizza gem in Phoenix.   We started with the Palle Di Riso, which was delicious. The coating was crunchy, light, and not greasy. The risotto inside had great texture and flavor as well.   Sampled both the the Dolce Diavolo and Rocco pizzas. The Dolce Diavolo was the stand-out between the two. Sopressata, Calabrian chiles, and honey form the perfect combination: sweet, savory, and a bit of heat (pretty genius, right?). The Rocco was delicious as well, but not quite as good. The crust (made using an 18 year old starter) was fantastic. Nice service and unpretentious atmosphere.",

We walked over the La Piazza because of the great ratings and....well, it's pizza! Pizza is wood fired and the oven can be seen right inside the dining area. Dining area is small, but definitely warm and intimate. My hubs had the pizza (his usual pepperoni). Totally delicious. The crust was thick and the bread dough added amazing flavor. Fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce was the highlight. We will definitely be back again. Overall, great place to try whether it's a casual or date night.",

I usually come for dinner and have been here more than 5 times (Physically and uber eats) and every time it's been consistently good. My bf and I will start with the meat and cheese platter which is a great quality board with warm pita bread. If we're not too hungry we'll share a pizza but more often we're pretty hungry for this place. My bf will get a pizza and I'll get the carbonara pasta and we'll pick at each other's food. I can't think of the name, but the pizza is a spicy honey drizzled type that never disappoints and it's what we split if we're not that hungry. The pasta though .... it's magical. It just tastes like an authentic Italian grandma made it with love. Can't be beat. The prices are fair and I always enjoy supporting local businesses. Stop by and give this place a try!!! Their cocktails are good too!!",

My buddy had been here once before and recommended the pizza.   The restaurant has a very 'urban' vibe. The server was very friendly but the service felt a little abrupt.   I started out with a craft beer in a bottle. No taps here. And spent some time looking over the menu. All the pizzas looked unique and different. After going back and forth between two, I took the recommendation of the server and ordered the Dolce Diavolo. I was a little worried about the honey, but the slight sweetness balanced out the spice of the Calabrian Chilis.   The toppings were used sparingly and allowed for a different flavor profile with each bite. The basil was the perfect note to finish off the slightly charred flavor of the crust.   I ended up getting the 'Sour Elder' as a cocktail and loved it!  I was expecting it to be sweeter than it was, but was pleasantly surprised at the sour notes that shone through.",

No only was the vibe quaint and cozy but the food and service was excellent.   The menu has a variety of excellent choices for every palette!  I had the house red for starters. Very nice touch and a superb compliment to the meal.   When my friends came in we ordered the focaccia bread. Its a meal pretending to be a starter! I got the calzone. They normally fry (Fritte) their calzone but I asked to have it baked in the pizza oven. Not their typical way but I was very happy they were able to do it!  I'm a bit of a freak for a good calzone and this one did not disappoint!    The ingredients were as fresh as can be and the ricotta was soooo fresh and flavorful! My friends had one if the classic signature pies.  No complaints from anyone. One really cool thing was lots of people from downtown coming by! Like a neighborhood inside a ginormous metro area!    Love that, don't you. Take the time to get downtown and stop in for great food and service! Oh, the wine was good too!",

We were not greeted but instead had to go get an employee to seat us.  2. Never received drinks but were charged for them  3. Had to get our own silverware  4. Did not have anyone check on our table even once 5. We waited for about 20 minutes after finishing before asking for our check and they made it seem like an inconvenience  I've been using yelp for years and leave both great and negative reviews. In the restaurant business you need to be consistently great.   I will also mention I was at this place with other people who use yelp and will leave similar reviews shortly. If you have any questions feel free to contact me through yelp.   Every restaurant has a bad night, but you can't rock 4.5 stars and perform like you did today.   - Paul",

Cibo is my favorite but there is also Pomo and nook.  Service- waiter hovered and repeatedly came over to ask for food and drink orders when we weren't ready. Which is fine, he was nice about it when we weren't ready. But after we ordered, the guy was nowhere to be seen. Needed napkins, a straw, chili flakes, more wine. None of that was attended to.  Food- we ordered the \"lasagna\" pizza which was good. Not great but good. And we also tried to order the carbonara pasta but they were out of peas (on a Friday in season) so we went with the pesto pasta. My husband makes homemade pasta and I make a decent pesto. We also eat out, a lot. To our disappointment this pesto pasta was the worst we'd ever had. So so so oily!!! See photo and that's after I mopped up half the oil. It was like they made the pesto earlier and then reheated it. And when we told our server, see above. He tried to tell us all pesto was oily and acted like we didn't know what pesto was. From that point forward he was attitude City. I understand if management doesn't allow comped dishes that suck but no need to be rude. We weren't expecting a comped meal but we were expecting at a minimum, acknowledgement.  Finally- their wine pours suck. For $10-12 a glass I'd expect more than five sips.",

We were seated immediately and looked over the drink menu. They are mainly a beer and wine place but they do have a few cocktails on draft. None of the cocktails looked that appealing so I stuck with wine.  We started with the Mozzarella in Carrozza, and the Palle di Riso. The 2nd dish was really special, I had never tried anything like it before, it's a risotto ball stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella. It's a must try.  We ordered quite a few pizzas for the table, my two favorites were the Italian Stallion and the Lasagne Ah' Pizza, both had delicious San Marzan and Schreiner's Sausage.   Our server was attentive and the food was above average, however with there being so many other pizza joints in the valley this once just gets 3 stars A-ok.

More than my pizza actually! The salad was delicious and perfect to start. Ha! As far as drinks, nothing stood out, not even the wine. No worries, sometimes I love enjoying dinner without a drink and going somewhere after instead! We sat at the bar, our waitress was sweet who always made sure we were taken care of. Occasionally, another waiter would come over and he would double check on us too, which was really nice. It seems like they all work very hard and independently - which I personally love! Sometimes I hate when it's TOO friendly and work ends up slacking because of its looseness that usually follows with that, but not here! For as much as I've gone to Hanny's (across the street) I'm surprised it took me so long to come here! Will definitely come back and I look forward to trying the cannoli next time!",

We had the barrata appetizer, a green salad (balsamic dressing excellent) pizza; crust fresh, buttery, like I would expect at a really good quality pizzeria, pasta was absolutely fresh & delicious, and we topped it off with a dessert of freshly cooked dough with drizzles of Nutella, this needed much more Nutella but otherwise delicious. Very reasonably priced!!!",

    "text": "Wow, wow and wow. As I walked into this dope little spot that was jamming out to Jay-Z I just knew....it may be True love. I was greeted promptly and happily by Matteo, who was also my server. I sat at the little bar area and ordered a beer and hung out while browsing over the menu. I was going stag that night, and everyone was super friendly! Not in the manner of \"wow this chick probably has no friends, what a loser\" type fake friendly....but genuinely super cool, including the owner who was manning the oven.   It finally came time to order some food, so I decided to go with the Pizza Special, the Tricolore. It was perfect because I couldn't decide on just one pizza, and this pizza was split into three different sections. I added some anchovies to one part and wow. Took the first bite and wanted to punch someone in the face because of how good it was. The cheese, you could tell was fresh and made in house. The crust was the perfect amount of crispy and soft and all the ingredients were great. I also saved room for a cannoli and couldn't be happier with how good THAT was. Just the right amount of sweet, perfect crunch of the shell, none of the extra added BS like chocolate shit drizzled for no apparent reason.   I'll definitely be coming back and bringing more people. Thanks La Piazza.",

    "text": "I was pressed for time today so I ordered the Calzone (Pizza Fritti) to go.  From the moment I opened the box, I could tell this calzone, was different from any other one that I have had in the past.  Unlike other calzones that you get in other \"pizza\" restaurants, these are fried, instead of baked, using the same \"certified authentic\" dough used to make their wonderful pizzas.  The result is a soft and chewy dough that holds the fillings in check, and is a delicacy all on it's own.  The calzone comes filled with salami, ricotta cheese, house-made mozzarella, and San Marzano tomatoes, all playing together in harmony as they dance across your palate.   And although not listed on the menu, mine contained a few ripe olives which at first surprised me, but added a whole new complexity to the experience.  La Piazza Locale continues to impress me, and if YOU only remember one part of my review during YOUR visit, it is this:  \"Experience as written!\"   A lot of thought went into the items on the menu and they are beautifully crafted with flavors in perfect balance...Do not mess with perfection.",

First, after seeing two very different pictures for the regular Margherita pizza and the Regina Margherita DOC, I was told the only difference was that one had buffalo cheese.  We also got the pesto pasta, which tasted more of pine nuts than pesto.  And finally, we had a cannoli for desert and it was dreadful.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to be blown away, or even moderately impressed.",

Server seemed very friendly, but the attention was lacking.  We had to ask multiple times for parts of our order.  Ordered the calamari for appetizer- it was average.  Ordered the Italian Stallion Pizza. Serving portion was pretty large.  It was pretty descent but not as good as expected. The best part of the meal in my opinion was the dark green salad, which was very fresh and the dressing was excellent.  For the price, I would expect more. The waitress was very very nice but did not pay enough attention to our order or detail.",

Our group was segregated into three subgroups.  Servers could not (or did not want to) make out separate checks for each family, so we had to figure out the bill per subgroup.  But all the somewhat frustrating stuff aside, the food was excellent, the service was excellent, and we all enjoyed a great meal together.  It was a fun night for our team and we would definitely come back again next year should we choose to play in the Volleyball Festival.",

Wow, was this simple dish full of flavor! The sauce was simply amazing and should be their 'go to' dish. I liked it so much I came back June 29 and ordered the same thing...same result...amazing flavor.  Their tiramisu is outstanding as well.  This is a good family restaurant that has their ingredients and pizza oven imported from Italy. You can taste the difference in these authentic ingredients.  I will always return to this place and eventually try their awesome looking pizza.  Cheers!",

    "text": "If you are in the downtown area and looking for some delicious pizza this is an excellent choice. La Piazza is right across the street from Cityscape next to Cartel Coffee and is certified by Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana so you know this is legit Neapolitan style pizza.   In addition to pizzas they have salad, paninis, pasta, and a few appetizers. We started out with the arancini appetizer (AKA Palle di Riso) and shared the Napoletana pizza. The arancini was superb. It had a perfect crispy fried outer coating with perfectly cooked risotto, small chunks of prosciutto, rapini, and mozzarella. It was topped with arugula and covered in a delightful tomato sauce. The flavors and textures complimented each other well. I'd definitely get this again!  I wasn't a fan of the flavors in my pizza. The toppings for the Napoletana are anchovies, olives, parmesan, capers, mozzarella, fresh basil, and tomato sauce. I should have known that this would be a super salty pizza based on the ingredients alone. I had never had anchovies on a pizza before, and the ones on my slices were so salty I had to take them off and eat them without the fish. It wouldn't look as nice but for me if they were chopped into smaller pieces that would disperse the flavors out more. The olives, parmesan, and capers additionally added to the salt level so in general I felt like it was a very unbalanced tasting pizza. I did enjoy the sauce, fresh mozzarella and lovely crust though. The crust was crisp with a slight outer char on the outside with a tender chewiness on the inside.   As for drinks, you should definitely get the iced tea. It's made by Infusion Coffee and Tea in Tempe, and the desert blossom tea I tried was so flavorful and refreshing.   Service was not the friendliest but got the job done. Drinks were refilled as needed and we were checked up on adequately.  Overall it was a good experience. I'll be back to try a different pizza and to get that delicious arancini!",

    "text": "We went last night for the first time, and will never return.  I have never before seen such a badly run restaurant.  Extremely unprofessional staff.  It was busy when we went, and we were told there would be at least a half hour wait.  Fine, we were willing to wait and put our name on the list.  While we were standing there, one of the waitresses was asked by another customer how long the wait would be.  Her response was \"I don't know, I just know I'm really stressed right now.\"  Other customers waiting heard this.  Okaaaay...that was not a good sign, but we stayed. Then a couple of tables outside finished and left.  The tables remained uncleared for over half an hour.  The waitress disappeared for a very long time.  Nobody else stepped up to clear the tables so the waiting customers could be seated.    Then...a bit later we hear a commotion behind us. One of the other customers who was waiting alerted the rest of us to the fact that this waitress was back and just letting anybody who walked by on the sidewalk take those tables.  When the other customer pointed out that there was a waiting list and just letting anybody walking down the street claim a table was unfair to the rest of us who had been standing there for a long while and put our names on the list, the waitress didn't care and was very dismissive to the woman who complained.    Then we were called and almost seated...until somebody else who wasn't there when called showed up again and the hostess said we now had to wait...again.  Finally another table left...but it remained uncleared for quite a while.  We were the next people on the list at this point...had been for a while...but we were fed up.  We left. We wasted about an hour at this place and didn't even get to eat.  Busy is one thing, but unprofessional is another.   I don't care if this is the best pizza on the face of the earth (though I highly doubt it is considering how badly run it is.)  A place this unprofessional and this disrespectful to customers will not get my business.    Pizarria Bianco is excellent and well run...go there instead.  You will thank me.",

Our benchmark for these wood fired Neapolitan places is the original Pomodoro on Scottsdale Road before they moved.    As the photo shows, they've earned the Verace Neapoletana Certificate and we can attest to its yummy goodness.   We've tried most things on the menu, from the pastas, to almost all the pizzas(photo) and desserts.  We really haven't found anything that we would give less than Four Stars to. They're just solid.   About a year and a half ago Guy Fieri came through town and liked what he saw. On your way out you'll notice the DDD poster and his signature attached.   Now we've learned, that this isn't always a good housekeeping seal of approval, since he also likes Dives. But the food at la Piazza is good and we always come back whenever we're in downtown PHX.

My favorite part of the pizza was the spicy bite the Calabrian Chiles had. I am definitely coming back to try the other variety of pizzas they serve.  This place is highly recommended!!!!",

    "text": "Out of all of my favorite pizzerias in Phoenix, it has taken me awhile to get around to reviewing La Piazza Phx (formerly Locale). For those of you unfamiliar, this is the sister-restaurant of La Piazza al Forno. The menu has similarities, with the addition of some unique items that are excluded from their Glendale restaurant.  Make no mistake, the pizza served here is identical to Al Forno in regards to taste, but that has both its pros and cons.   The Regina Marghertia D.O.C. (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), which is just a fancy way of saying that it adheres to strict VPN guidelines, is a textbook example of how simplicity and tradition always win. No BBQ chicken/sauce to be found here thank goodness!  Additionally, they also serve another personal favorite, the Dolce Diavolo. I've had various versions of this style of pizza at many places, but the addition of honey gives this creation what I'd refer to as a power-up! I've often said that if I opened up my own pizzeria, this would be one of the pizzas that I'd shamelessly rip-off and rename for my own menu. Additionally, the Pizza Fritte, which is a fried calzone, appears to be unique to this location and comes highly recommended.  All the ingredients they use are top notch, but I've often found that their dough is very dense, heavy, and often times, just way too damned salty. This makes the dough far more filling that you would expect from this kind of pizza.  They don't offer regular bread as a starter, so you're stuck getting a focaccia, which is basically like eating a bare-bones pizza before eating an actual pizza. If you order the Angioletti for dessert, you end up coming to the realization 95% of what you've consumed for dinner was essentially just a bunch of dough.  Their pastas are okay, but nothing I'd really go out of my way to obtain. I previously vouched for the carbonara, but found it to be unusually salty on our most recent visit.  Sadly, I've never been a big fan of Al Forno's desserts. Finding a cheesecake or cannoli in Phoenix is as easy as locating a QuickTrip. We usually opt for the Angioletti con Nutella, but I find myself preferring the more liberally prepared Nutella calzones, crepes, and pizzas served at other joints.  Overall, I like and respect what they're doing here in terms of adhering to tradition. And while I'll admit that their pizza is usually decent, I do feel there are better places to go if you're familiar with the surrounding area's pizza scene.",

The wait staff were my favorite part, as they were much friendlier (hunkier) and more helpful than most.   Waiter helped me to choose a great table wine that was delicious but light so we could polish it off quickly. We had tickets for a show, so the kitchen rushed our pizzas out of the wood-fired oven in record time. The pizza on special was the Valentino, with mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, prosciutto and  the best crust ever. This was honestly the best crust, no kidding.   I wish I could have stayed and savored longer. There are plenty of appetizers and small dishes to mix-and-match, including the house antipasti platter, which was also incredible. I had to take my cannoli to-go, because I was so stuffed. It made a scrumptious post-Valentine's breakfast.",

Parking was a little dicey and although there is parking available on the street and a small lot across the street we still found the parking a little challenging. It is certainly not a deal breaker.    We started out with the Palle di Riso.  I thought they were light on seasoning and had one small piece of rapini and mozzarella.  They also left a bitter after taste that I attributed to oil that was dirty.  The tomato sauce was also lacking flavor and was very flat.   We next shared the Rucola salad.  We added the prosciutto which was a $2 up charge.  The salad was lovely.  The prosciutto was very good and very good tasting.  The arugula was sweet and nutty.    We chose the napoletana because of the more unusual ingredients.   It was good and salty which you would expect with capers, olives and anchovies.  I would have like to have seen more basil on the pie.  The basil did a good job balancing out the saltiness.  Again I thought the pie sauce was a little tasteless and the cheese in the pie was a tad light.  The dough was Excellent.  Some of the best I have ever tasted and I hail from the east coast.  It was really the best thing about the pie.  The wine list is mostly Italian and we found a Malbec that was nice to drink.  Would I come back?   Probably not.  There are other pizza joints I have enjoyed a lot more.  I usually agree with howard on his reviews.  Unfortunately, this one didn't meet the mark.",

The sauce tasted like mouth watering vine ripe tomatoes with fresh herbs and spices. Fresh is so incredibly important when going out to eat and this place did it just right! The service was OUTSTANDING! Our server John even had such a wonderful Italian accent when pronouncing the True to Italian specials :) the cook came by more than once to ask how we liked our pizza! The atmosphere was comfortable, neatly decorated and not to big. I highly recommend brick oven pizza from this place if you are in downtown. Hands down the best pizza I have had in a long time! A+++ for the service and fresh ingredients!",

With that being said, I have never been to Italy.       But the food was really amazing for the price. I Spent 35 bucks and had an 3 course meal of high quality tasty food.         However, I am a stickler for service. Even though I did not see anyone wait very long to get seated (self included), It took 5 minutes to get acknowledged for a drink - and I sat at the bar. Followed by me flagging servers down to take my order plus asking the owners wife for a utensils and my napkin.        Bless the owner and his wife. He is busting his butt cooking for quality and trying to keeps things moving and his wife was very nice and tried to do the same.        Rare is it that I would consider going somewhere again with bad service. But - I under stood the issue, not the food, location, price, quality of restaurant - but staff. I will come again. lol.",

Meat and cheese plate was good, pizza ok, but kind of soggy.  Service was terrible.  Apparently having hair in your food is not a big deal to this place.

We split two pizzas, the Italian Stallion and the Dolce Diavolo (which comes with Sopressata, Calabrian Chiles, Fresh Basil and Honey) crazy combo but totally works!  I equally loved both pizzas so much and killed almost two whole ones by myself (the other couple that came with us couldn't finish all their and I gladly helped.) Like other reviewers, the crust was perfectly charred and the only thing I could compare it to was a marshmallow. When you roast marshmallows and make that perfect one that has that golden brown char on the outside and it's cooked just enough on the inside to where it's creamy and tender... Thats what this crust is like! Best pizza I've ever had!",

I inquired about an item on the menu and she didn't really sell the pizza. I was never offered any water until after my meal. Soft drink was brought out to me in a large soda bottle. No glass or ice. I had to ask for that too. After I paid my check I was brought only one copy (store copy) of the receipt. I asked for my copy and she told me it was a new system, so no copy for me. Really? That goes against every customer rule I've ever heard of. So I took a picture of my receipt instead. I should follow up with the owner but didn't have time this evening. The pizza was good and tasty but this place needs to close the loop on their customer skills. I can't recommend this place due to mediocre bordering bad customer service.",

    "text": "Have you ever eaten at Pomo? Cibo? Bianco?  If yes, then you know what to expect of this neapolitan-style pizza.  It's delicious, super thin, and yes, a little soupy (as it's supposed to be).   In my own humble opinion, the two winners for this type of pizza in Phoenix are Piazza and Pomo.  They are very similar, and even have a similar ambiance.  Piazza is located more downtown, whereas Pomo is in the Roosevelt district.    My boyfriend and I ate there on a Friday night.  We went in around 7:30, and were seated immediately.  We started off with two of their signature cocktails. By the end of the night I had tasted three out of four, and let me tell you....FANTASTIC!!!!! Especially the bourbon-based drink, nice and tangy.   We ordered the calamari and mozzarella appetizers. The calamari was very lightly breaded, and cooked perfectly.  I find that many restaurants tend to over-cook, and the calamari ends up chewy and rubbery.  This was absolutely perfect.  The mozzarella was great, although I'm not a huge fan of fried mozzarella,  but for what it was, it was yum.  Both appetizers were served with their tomato pizza sauce for dipping.  It's a traditional pizza sauce, best described as watery and runny (again, that's how it's supposed to be).  SO GOOD.    We ordered the margarita pizza, because I like to judge restaurants based on how well they do the simple stuff, before getting all fancy. The pizza came out perfectly, nice and hot, with chewy crust and melty cheese. Seriously, this pizza is amazing.  The staff is awesome, very attentive and friendly, with great suggestions.  We chatted with the owner, who liked us enough to send over a complementary slice of their ricotta cheesecake.  Now, I usually hate cheesecake.  It's too rich and dense for me.  This cheesecake couldn't be more different from the usually Cheesecake Factory heart attack on a plate that you usually see.  It was very light and fluffy, with a hint of lemon and drizzled with honey, perfect complements to the tang of the cheese.   In all, fabulous pizza, fabulous people.  Definitely going to be going back there.  The nice part about it is...They are closed on Sunday, whereas Pomo is closed on Monday.  Now we can get great pizza seven days a week!",

What a mistake! There were six of us and most of us ordered the pizza. The dough was undercooked or should I say chewy and almost raw, The tomato sauce was a poor imitation of Italian tomato sauce, watery and awful, and the little bitty pieces of mozzarella on the pizza were pitiful! What a disappointment! To add insult to injury the water they served had a metallic taste that made it undrinkable.Overall I wish I could give a -2 review. It was that bad!",

    "text": "Having opened just a few weeks ago, La Piazza Locale brings the 2nd VPN-certified Neapolitan pizza to downtown Phoenix.  The first thing I thought when I found this place was, \"What, don't we have enough excellent pies downtown?\"  But we had to try it anyways.  My friend went with Rocco, and I went with the special of the day Don Matteo (smoked butternut squash puree as the sauce, with speck and mozarella).  My first observation was that the crust had the soupiness that a real Napoletana pizza should have.  The crust was perfect.  This is knife-and-fork pizza, and if you think their crust is too soggy, you're wrong.  The smoked butternut was phenomenal.  I'm not sure that's a real authentic ingredient for Neapolitan pizza, but it was probably one of the top three pies I have ever eaten.  My friend's Rocco was pretty good, too, but the Don Matteo was definitely at a whole different level.  My only real complaint about this place was that the music was a little too loud and too trendy.  When dining, I don't like it when the music is too noticeable.  I usually prefer restaurants not to be too trendy, but everything else about the restaurant was great, so I can let this pass.  Locale is now on my short list of best pies in the Valley.  It's not as good as Bianco, but it's top tier.",

If I'm not throwing away your crust, your restaurant is doing something right.  The different cheeses used were delicious, but I have to say it wasn't as flavorful as other white pizzas I've had.  Maybe add a little more garlic or some sort of drizzle (think pesto or balsamic).  They serve Coke in a glass bottle (my favorite kind with real cane sugar).  The service was average at best.  I love going places that have exceptional service, so this fact might stop me from being a regular here.  It's not a very big place, so I was disappointed in the limited interaction we had with our server.  I'll most likely go back again and hope the next dish I try is out of this world and that my server is more friendly.",

They don't seem too keen on substitutions for ingredients, regardless of the patrons' preferences - particularly when it comes to cheese - and they're very strict on specific dining policies. It's understandable to want a more turnkey approach to food prep, without getting too far in the weeds with accommodations (I'm assuming unless it's an allergy). However, more flexibility with the menu would make the whole experience more enjoyable.   Having brought someone there for the first time and after being awkwardly told that we couldn't have precisely what we wanted, prepared the way we wanted, with no real explanation except basically, \"that's just how we do it,\" I'm less inclined to go back - which is a shame, because I'd rather spend money on a small local business staffed with good people than spend money elsewhere.",

Well after trying this Margherita from La Piazza it was not even second, third or fourth for that matter. The lack of taste on the crust and tomato sauce was very noticeable. Plus the crust was just not crispy enough to hold the sauce from making it soggy after just a few minutes. It was prepared in a very quick time but that was only because there were 3 people there. I do have to admit the Mexican half liter coke was pretty cold and tasty. I will probably go and try something else with other ingredients but knowing the crust is just lack of taste it's will be hard for me to go back.",

Everyone's pizza looked good and we all placed an order. I wasn't impressed at all. The sauce had a funky taste to it that I couldn't really get into and I love pizza. I got the Montanara, where they flash the crust then they cook it. The crust was really delish. But I ended up unable to finish the one slice.   Our service was kinda slow which made no sense because they weren't that busy. The tap water is horrid. Don't get it. Lol. All the drinks come in a bottle...a very large one I might add.   The price per pizza was a bit pricey for the size $10-$16. And the bottle drinks were almost $4.   Overall, it's safe to say that I did not like the food and even though the service was slow, the people were nice.",

We started dinner with the risotto rice balls. These were definitely the best part of the meal:  crispy and crunchy on the outside but soft, tender, and chewy on the inside.  We split the carbonara for the main course.  It was also tasty -- some might find the pasta too soft but I personally thought it was cooked perfectly.  My one complaint would be I thought it a smidge too salty, likely because of the copious amounts of pork mixed in.  The peas cut the saltiness a little bit, but I was still draining glasses of water.  The dessert was weak, in my eyes.  We had the Nutella and fried dough strips.  The dough itself was oily and there was not enough Nutella or powdered sugar to combat it.  The bathrooms were also a little dirty.  On the whole, though, the restaurant offers a lovely, authentic Italian experience at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "My fiance and I were staying across the way at the Renaissance downtown Phoenix hotel. I checked in with Yelp to see if there were any great restaurants nearby, and in walking distance. We were definitely in the mood for pizza and wine. It was a Friday night so we figured they would be super busy. We called ahead and we were able to make a reservation easily. In the reviews, it mentioned that they do their pizza brick oven style so I was looking forward to enjoying that. A little different than your average pizza in a box experience. I don't indulge in pizza often, So when I do I want it to be good and worth the calories! When we arrived, I was surprised to see it not very busy. There were a few larger tables in the back that were full of people, otherwise we could take or pick where we wanted to be seated. We were seated right by the window so we could properly enjoy people watching while we eat. I ordered a glass of red and my fiance ordered a beer. We ordered a salad and a pizza to split. The server was giving us kind of bizarre vibes. I don't know if it was a cultural barrier, or what but every time he asked us for something He kind of lingered there, this happened a few different times. That was the only odd experience that we left with. You can walk over and watch them make a pizza in the brick oven. It's quite cool. The pizza and salad were good. We were in and out of there in under an hour. It was very quick. I thought it was going to be a little bit more fine dining that was. I ended up being a little overdressed. It's much more casual than you would think! Enjoy.",

They were more so simply enjoying their night out as a group, which seemed to be mainly about discussing music anyways, and calmed down after a mere 5 minutes or so and then continued on with general conversation prior to their meals arriving. The waitress still attended everyone else in the restaurant including myself and the large group with the music in the upmost perfect and respectful manner as should always be presented. The food was spectacular and service was quick and spunky just as I enjoy. I will DEFINITELY be coming back again!",

It is a perfect spot to grab a bite to eat before a game or a show. It has a great atmosphere and very nice and informative staff. We have had the margharita and Italian Stallion, both were amazing and cooked perfectly in their brick oven. One of my absolute favorite things here are their desserts. I have heard that their house made tirimisu is amazing, but we tend to eat late and it has been sold out. So we have had their house made cheesecake each time and it is the best cheesecake I have ever had. I highly recommend everything about this place. A must hit in downtown Phoenix!",

    "text": "O mio Dio!! My friends know I don't like pizza, so believe me when I say this place is phenomenal. (My friends are also probably sick of this word.)  I was introduced to this place while looking for a place to dine while working Phoenix Comicon this year. My friend wanted pizza and I was too tired to argue with him. I'm so grateful I didn't. We were seated immediately and the server was very friendly and attentive.  My friend introduced me to burrata. It was a little ball of heaven. It melted in your mouth and was creamy. It came with speck (prosciutto) and Rob said it was delectable and perfect. I don't eat pork, so I'll take his word for it.  Following this was the quattro formaggio pizza. Oh sweet baby Jesus.... I loved it.  Then came the tiramisu. The owner's wife makes it daily from scratch. I've had my share of \"good\" tiramisu desserts that people raved about, but I could never fathom ever eating a second time. Hers was amazing. It is rich and the lady fingers are perfectly soaked with just enough of the coffee liqueur. The marscapone is creamy, smooth and layered equally. This is the only place I will eat this dessert now. Just delicious and a dance for my taste buds!  Since then, I've brought my sister, niece, son, mother, co-workers and friends to this place. They all love it. I've tried their burrata pizza, their regina margherita pizza and also the bianca. All of these are fantastic!!  I was finally brave enough to try calamari when one of my friends ordered it. Both my friend and my mother are extremely picky about calamari since it can be quite rubbery when not cooked right. Their calamari came out perfect. Not one bit was bad and the garlic and Italian chilies are very good with it. We were stabbing each others' hands with forks to get at the garlic.  Here's one thing that I found to set them apart from other restaurants. When I ordered the burrata and speck the last few times I was there, the server remembered that I do not eat pork, so he substituted artichokes and tomatoes so I could enjoy the entire appetizer. They didn't up-charge for the substitution like most places would.  For those with a nut allergy - Their pesto is made with almonds. It is not on the menu, so if you don't ask, you won't know.",

    "text": "My husband and I returned this evening and had the Burratta e Speck appetizer, Margherita DOC pizza and Cannoli.  We love this place, which is VPN certified so you know you are getting True Napoletan style pizza.  Honestly, I can't  seem to get excited about anything other than this style of pizza ever again, so simple and flavorful that my eyes roll back into my head every time I eat there.  I can't wait to try their pastas.  The Cannoli was amazing.  The texture was beautiful and the serving was probably twice as large as what I expected.  I had it was a double shot of espresso; the perfect thing.  The only thing that we would have changed was the music, which was sort of rap influenced, American Idol style mainstream stuff that I'd expect to hear in a gym, or some run of the mill college pizza pub. But this is not college pizza pub pizza but pizza designed for a more sophisticated palette so homogenized pop/rap just doesn't suit.  I'm not saying they need to play Mario Lanza recordings or anything but something that connects a little more with the food and Italian culture would be sort of unique and special.  We've been in a couple of times this summer and the music just doesn't make any sense.  Maybe if they streamed in an Italian radio station, with contemporary Italian artists it would be an even more stimulating sensory experience.  Of course, if they wanted to have Puccini and Verdi playing some of the time, I'd just bring my cribbage board and never leave.  We arrived on our bicycles by the way and it was nice to find bike parking right out front, by the way.",

Four days before the birthday dinner, I called to let them know our party had now increased to 20 and to ask if this would be a problem, as I would change our dinner venue.  They informed me they should be fine to accommodate and took my contact details.  The birthday evening, we arrive ahead of time only to be told that another party of 15 was expected and whichever group got there first would get to be seated.  I was annoyed, but thankfully, our party arrived soon and they offered to seat us 10 inside and 10 outside. ??? Not exactly the birthday celebration set up I wanted, nor was this ever mentioned as a logistics challenge.  We reluctantly agreed to be seated only to continue to be treated rudely by the wait staff multiple additional times.  Enough was enough and we left.  Not once during our visit did we hear a polite, welcoming or grateful phrase from the staff.  Give this one a miss.

    "text": "Not sure I'll be back. Had a very unfortunate experience at the restaurant today and despite me loving their food, I was appalled at the treatment of the staff and customers (owner's response on a separate review) today.   We were the third table sat in the restaurant when we arrived for lunch. Soon thereafter a large lunch rush ensued and it was evident that they were very understaffed. Understanding that this was of no fault of my server, I expressed that we received our appetizer late and cold and we would like a warm appetizer to go along with our pizza order to go. During this time I watched my server be reprimanded on the restaurant floor twice by a woman who had previously been working behind the bar.   That same woman brought a new, heated, appetizer to our table and proceeded to insinuate that the reason our appetizer was late and cold was because the server did not indicate that it should be brought out before the pizza.   I question why then we received the cold appetizer ahead of our pizza anyway, despite her explanation to the contrary. It just came across as lacking accountability and looking for someone to blame. The server's fault or not, according to the policies that run the restaurant, reprimanding staff in front of customers is degrading and humiliating. Not owning the issue to your paying customer and blaming a member of the staff  is perplexing, because your staff is your restaurant, the blame still rests on the restaurant. Even though this woman who was later identified as the owner, acknowledged the issue, she never once provided an apology for the poor experience; our server however did.   Everyone makes mistakes and it can't be a swing it out of the ballpark experience every time, but being accountable and apologizing when mistakes are made, regardless of who made them on the staff, is how loyal staff and customers are kept. Instead, some simple feedback provided to the restaurant turned into the blame game.",

If you want to hear a manager belittle their employees, post your receipt with name and last 4 of credit card, and then call you an Ahole then La Piazza is the place to go  I usually never have a bad experience at La Piazza Phx but today was a different story. Let me be clear and state that the 1 star review has everything to do with the owner Rachelle and how she handled a difficult situation. We ordered our calamari & pizza, once 40 minutes passed & we noticed that a group of people who arrived after us received their calamari order before us, we stayed patient and then received our cold calamari. We explained this to the waiter and he was very sweet and apologetic, it was Rachelle the owner who overheard this and then grabs the calamari to what I assume she goes and re heats it. When she comes back she doesn't apologize at any point but asks us if the waiter asked us if we wanted the appetizer before the pizza which we assumed was a given since it is an appetizer. Still not quite sure why that mattered since the cold calamari came to our table 45 min after ordering but still before our pizza was even close to being done. It appeared that she wasn't being accountable of the situation like a professional owner would. Our table heard her multiple times scold her employees in front of everyone there, how anyone can work under those conditions is beyond me. We then ask for our food to go since at this point we are there well over an hour in and all we had received was cold calamari. We finally received all of our food and proceeded to pay full price, I honestly still tipped the waiter because I felt bad on how he was treated. If Rachelle is truly the owner I feel that there will be a lot more negative reviews on the way, as this location is understaffed and poorly managed. I suggest they keep up to date with downtown events to know when they will be having more of a rush. I also suggest Rachelle attends some type of management training for the hope of the employees.",

Nearly every open table was left unbussed and the cooks looked a little lost. They did say that someone would seat me soon. When they came around, I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar - the only clean area to sit. I preferred a table which had to be cleaned up. I thought they'd at least clean up the surrounding tables near by, but they were left untouched. Ok then. Service was a bit slow, I had a dirty drink glass, but at least the server was nice when I asked for things.   I had a salad, which was sparsely dressed. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. It was comparable to a trough of hay. The pizza was ok and got soggy after a while. Maybe it was an off night, maybe not? I'll never know since I'm just visiting. I got to stare at a lonely spinach leaf and chunk of feta on another table the whole time. I should have gone with my first estimation on this place.

The calamari and Italian stallion pizza were spot on. The spinach salad was super fresh and the Tiramisu desert was the best we experienced. Friendly staff, modern equipment, clean environment, and a gorgeous pizza oven.  We will definitely go there again, and recommend this to all the friends in town. We are from Ontario Canada and would love to see a restaurant like this in our neck of the woods in Toronto.",

You say I was whispering, ma'am I speak in a low register, as to not come across loud. And I also didn't think it was the table behind us business to hear the complaint against their waitress. As you mentioned, I'm not welcomed in your restaurant. And the over 5000 people my mother will be a tour guide for in August will not visit your establishment either. I RAVED about how awesome your place was based on my prior visits. You act as if I was asking for something for free. I asked about a discount. I never demand anything from an establishment except for good service as a customer. Now, as you said I'm not welcomed, and I'll never be back. Thank you.",

Background: there is some Italian Certification for Napoletana pizza that a restaurant can receive and La Piazza has done just this. All fresh ingredients and you can tell. We decided to get 2 separate meals so we could try multiple things. I got the Burrata pizza and my boyfriend got the Pizza Fritte- which is a pizza that they pull over to make a calzone. The pizza comes out looking lovely but a little thick for my like. I am a thin crust freak. But wait for it...it was delicious! I loved the crust and the simple sauce and fresh mozzarella on top were to die for! Same input for the calzone.. loved it!   It looks more like an order at the counter place so don't expect high end ambiance but the pizza is worth everything!   When in PHX search La Piazza out for a great pizza!",

The pizza is priced moderately for the taste. Having been to Italy I would highly suggest this place as an American equivalent. You have to try at least once! It's a set restaurant so I would get a table ahead of time especially on weekends and busy rush times. Great service!",

I've never been a huge fan of Phoenix but this place has changed my heart. I went with 3 coworkers and we were all in awe about how delicious the pizza was. We got 3 pizzas to share because according to us we weren't really all that hungry. We devoured all of them. We got 2 of the meat lover ones and 1 with the honey (sorry I don't recall the names) and they were both equally delicious. The honey one however is what I'm drooling and dreaming about. All the ingredients go so well together and it makes for an out of this world experience. If you haven't been here do yourself the favor and come. Order a beer or a glass of wine and brace yourself for some of the best pizza everrrrrr. Service was also amazing and I'm glad he suggest the honey one!",

I got the Italian  stallion. The dough and crust were prefect and cooked to perfection. The amount of toppings was very proper. Though it was a tad high on the salty scale. Ingredients were all super fresh. Only slight disappointment was the sauce was very light.   I also had the arancini which really showcases the wonderful sauce they have there.   Wait wasn't long and friendly service. Pro-tip carbonara is not served at lunch time (only reason I came here) and some prices were around 1-2$ more than the website.",

    "text": "La Piazza PHX satisfied my craving for good pizza while visiting this city. I was in town for a conference and luckily La Piazza was walking distance of the Phoenix Convention Center. I came here with a group and we all enjoyed what we ordered.   Their menu has pretty traditional/standard pizza options. I noticed that on their menu it said that La Piazza is VPN certified Neapolitan pizzeria, meaning that they adhere to a set of guidelines for this type of pizza. I got the Quattro Formaggio ($14) pizza and added sausage to it (+$2). I thought this pizza was pretty good but I wish I had gotten a pizza with red sauce instead. The brick-oven pizzas are about 12 inches so if you have a light appetite you could split the pizza with another person and be fine. Everyone who I ate with got their own pizza but only a couple people finished it. I ate about half of my pizza and boxed the other half which I ate later on in the afternoon, which kept just fine.   Both the service and the ambiance was just okay. We got seated in the corner near the restrooms and where the servers kept walking by. It was a bit uncomfortable of a spot and I felt like I was just staring at a wall. I was not a fan of the layout because I also could not see them making the brick oven pizza.  I think this was a cool spot and I did like the pizza. I would probably go back if I am ever in Phoenix again.",

Hungry for pizza and interested in trying this place that I'd never been to before, we walked in to be greeted by the kind and welcoming hostess... along with an off-putting (possibly cleaning fluid?) smell.  We were seated and eventually our server ambled over. I honestly don't know if he smiled once. We ordered the fried mozzarella and a Margherita pizza. I had to ask for water refills several times. We got new cups and the empty cups stayed on our tiny table. My date again commented on the smell that I was trying to ignore.  The food came out and it was.... alright. I'll be honest in that I think maybe the environment might have sullied my experience too much to really enjoy the meal. We were starved, so we finished everything and would have hustled out of there if our server ever wanted to bring us the check. I tried to get his attention several times, until the hostess noticed and finally blessed us with the promise of our bill.   Little things can be overlooked when the overall experience is good or the food is fantastic. But when everything starts to pile up, I'm not about it.",

The restaurant had the UFC fight on with the volume turned up and nothing else on, which set a weird ambiance seeing as how it's not a sports bar. Service was okay. We ordered an appetizer, salad, and pizza to share between two of us.   The fried mozzarella was okay - I was expecting something novel from the menu description (house made mozzarella) but what came out looked and tasted like normal fried mozzarella sticks from the freezer. My arugula salad was fine, it came out dressed though I ordered it dressing on the side which took some time to get someone's attention to fix. No big deal though. The Margherita pizza was pretty good, a little burnt on some parts but the sauce and cheese were quite good. It was a fine meal, but not very memorable or one of my favorite pizzas in Phoenix.",

    "text": "This place was great!  We came in on a Friday evening and were able to sit down right away.  Mateo was our server.  He knew the menu well and seemed to like everything on it.  After some deliberation, my wife and I ordered.  She had the pizza burrata and a grapefruit cocktail that was really good.  I had the Ragu Nepoletano.  The pizza crust was PERFECT!  Seriously, it had just the right consistency and the smell and flavor were spot-on.  The combination of fresh tomato sauce and cheese was excellent.  My Ragu could not have been better.  It had a combination of beef, pork and sausage.  The meats were tender but not over cooked.  The pasta was al dente and it was baked with mozzarella on top.  Very tasty.   Mateo, our server was attentive but laid back and ambiance was comfortable.  I recommend this place for anyone staying downtown in Phoenix.  I will be here for two more days and I plan to go again.",

    "text": "A fan of La Piazza in Glendale and being in Phoenix, I decided to dine at the \"sister\" restaurant.  Nice location, nice atmosphere.  Simple, clean decor.  The first thing I noted was that the menu is much smaller than the Glendale location.  No chicken marsala.. etc.  Ok, we accept that.  Decided to order Pizza margarita with prosciuito (extra charge).  Hubby ordered pasta puttanesca which was to include anchovies.  My pizza came out with very, very thin and scant prosciuitto.  I ordered this at the Glendale location and it was much more generous on the prosciutto.  I also recall seeing more basil on it.  It was good, but not the greatest.  The puttanesca was the star of the two dishes.  Garlicky red sauce with NOT an anchovy in sight.  The portion was small.  It was like being back in France where restaurants serve you like you are on a diet whether you want to be or not.  Flavorwise, I thought the sauce was good.  My husband's take was that the sauce was almost as good as mine (Thank you, darling).  Puttanesca sauce requires anchovies end of story and they were not there.   Although it was happy hour, our server did not offer any happy hour drinks.  We had to ask and after we did, he put a menu on the table which looked like their regular drinks list.  When we asked, he said everything was on there.  Don't most restaurants highlight what is part of the happy hour and how much it is?   I think if we were prompted, we would have imbibed some of the offerings.  Management:  you may want to let people know what the happy hour offers.  Why  don't you try offering an appetizer of the day with a signature cocktail, wine and beer of the day.  MAKE US WANT IT is what I am saying l!!!    Remember most of your customers are weak and waiting for an excuse to have a drink.   Well,  all in all, this place does NOT compare to the Glendale location.  Those of you who are giving this place rave reviews, go to the Glendale location first and then we'll talk.",

We were really disappointed.  Where Pomo is both classy and warm, this place was low rent.  The waiter was not particularly knowledgeable about the food and didn't seem to care that we were in the restaurant.  The pizza was not all that great.  I realize that this type of pizza is not the same as what people are used to, but we have some other examples in the downtown area of what it can and should be (Bianco, Pomo, CIbo) and these pies were just too thin and soggy in the middle, most of the dough was devoted to the edges and a bit too charred.  I had the unfortunately named Italian Stallion and was not impressed.  When we had some left over we had to flag down the water and ask for a box, after which a styrofoam clamshell - too small for what was left - was dumped on our table.  There were none of the little desert-ish extras that make Pomo so special.  I had hoped, particularly due to its location, that this would be a great place for dinner before a Diamondbacks game, but we are not likely to go back.",

They advertise San Marzano tomatoes, but we saw cans of Nina's tomatoes in the hallway.  You can purchase these tomatoes at Sam's club for $2.75 for #10 can.  The pizza was raw and inedible.   No one approached us to ask what was wrong.  We ate one slice a piece, then asked for the check.  The waitress packed the pizza, but we left it behind.  I will never eat there again.  I would highly discourage anyone from eating at this establishment.  I am embarrassed that they would call themselves Italian. Carmela R.",

Excellent, friendly service. The only negative was a family sitting nearby with a 2 year old. The parents thought she was Shirley Temple as they let her roam around the restaurant yelling at the top of her lungs. Nothing the management could do.",

Our party of four split a lettuce house salad and a spinach salad and two pizzas, a Margherita with  Pepporoni and one with home made mozzarella and sausage.  The crusts were crispy outside and very light inside and arrived at our table piping hot despite how busy the place was!  Our server and even other servers who checked on us were very friendly and efficient!  We will return whenever we are downtown for an event!  Very close to the U S Airway Center?",

    "text": "So........my mom is in town and I have been telling her about all the amazing pizza joints that I have been to since moving to Phoenix.  She is always down for some pizza so we decided to get some tonight.  We were going to go to the OG one in Glendale but its \"Christmas Light Season\" so I heard that they are always slammed and waits can be a bitch.  I figured that this one wouldn't be crowded so we drove downtown to try it out.  We found parking right out in front.  You are supposed to pay at the little kiosk thing but my mom is an old, hobbled soul who can't walk...aka, handicapped plates!  Score!   The place was easy enough to find.  It's not in a super duper obvious spot but it's right in the heart of downtown about a block or so from the stadiums etc.  We walked in and were seated by a table at the window. We placed our order for 2 Cokes ($3.00, liter of Mexican Coke in a bottle), a Pizza Fritte aka Calzone and a Salciccia e Friarielle pizza.  About 5 minutes later our food was out.  Here is how it tasted.....................  Salciccia e Friarielle ($15.00)-  My mom really likes sausage on pizza.  There were a few pizza options that had sausage and this one sounded unique and delicious, so we tried it.  This pizza came with smoked mozzarella di Bufala, Schreiners (Local sausage place) sausage, rapini (kale...looked like broccoli rabe kind of) and olive oil.  I should have probably read the description better because I swear that this one came with red sauce.  Nope...it was a white pie (olive oil based sauce).  First bite in, I noticed a few different things.  1.  The smoked mozzarella di Bufala is incredibly smoky!  It had a super strong flavor profile which was just a tad overpowering.  It was good, but not pizza good...that cheese would be better with crackers or wine or something on its own..not melted on pizza.  2.  This pizza was really \"wet\".  When I removed my first slice, I noticed that the plate that it was on was real wet on the bottom.  The crust was more soggy than normal and it was hard to pick up, fold and eat.  Almost a knife and fork job.  The non soggy crust was fantastic though and the rapini put a unique spin on the pizza.  The Schreiners sausage was the best part of the thing.  They cubed up this sausage and it was spread out evenly.  It was delicious.  A plain margherita pizza with sausage as a topping may be the way to go if you are a sausage lover.  We ate the whole thing, it was pretty tasty and unique but I would never order it again. Not bad by any means, just different and every other pizza I have had from this pizza family has been way better.  Pizza Fritte (Calzone) ($10.00)-  Wow!  Just WOW!  You want to talk about massive!  This thing is the size of a football!  This calzone is unique in the fact that they fry this bitch instead of bake it.  I cut this thing open and saw the fantastic ingredients of mozzarella, ricotta, salami and tomatoes just begging to be shoved in my mouth.  It comes topped with basil strips and served with a side of marinara sauce.  I took a bite of the dough and was hooked.  Its like eating Indian fry bread in pizza dough form.  It was very unique and very tasty.  This thing was so big that I had to take half of it home.  Good morning breakfast!  Can't wait!  I will definitely get this thing again.  For sheer value ($10.00), its the best thing on the menu.    Service was great!   Our waitress was on top of things and checked in with us a few times during our meal.   4 stars for now because of a few things.  First, it's way far away from my house in Surprise.  Second, the Glendale one is closer, tastes better and has more of a \"homey\" feel to it.  If I am ever downtown though watching a Suns/Dbacks game and want some pizza, I will definitely head over here again.",

I love the spaghetti very much because every ingredient inside matched quite well with each other. However, I am a little bit disappointed about the service. It was getting busy at that time and we waited for over half an hour for the pizza because they mixed us with the table next to ours. The two ladies sat down later than us but got their pizza more quickly than we did. This made us a bit annoyed but the flavor of food could make it up.",

This was one pizza place near us that we had not tried so on a Friday we found ourselves here. I was surprised that they were not very busy and the hostess gave us a slight attitude when we asked to be seated at a small table against the wall rather than near the door. Our waiter however was completely on his game. He was helpful and super patient as we generally take a good twenty minutes drinking our drinks and catching up and barely looking at the menu in front of us.. YES. We are that annoying couple who works a lot and meals out are for catching up sometimes. We were served waters and our drinks, bubbly Prosecco for me and an Italian beer for my husband, almost immediately. For you cocktail types, there are a few on the menu, but mainly you will find beer and wines here. Some great ones, I might add! Next door is the Kettle Black though, when you are done with your meal, if you are feeling like you need more libation! We love great calamari and we just had a feeling based on Yelp reviews that La Piazza would not disappoint us with their version.. They did not. This is the best calamari I have had in all of the desert. The calamari is crisp and spicy with calabrian chiles and and garlic and the chile sauce is to die for. I could have made this my entire meal! BUT fear not, Kimberly will get her pizza pie! We ordered the Italian Stallion.. Oh my. This Italian Stallion comes laden with lots of amazing-ness: The local Schreiners Sausage; Pepperoni; Prosciutto (cotto) and Sopresatta, and then San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella to perfect this stallion of a pie. Your mouth thanks you when you take your first bite. We also ordered The Blanca and added Sopresatta too. So tasty .. i loved this white pizza and the ricotta combined with EVOO and mozzarella.The crust is crisp from the wood fired oven and you know that VPN seal has been earned for a reason! There are many things on the menu at La Piazza that look so tasty that deciding on what pizza to get was a challenge. A good one! There are fresh salads , calzone, paninis, lots of antipasti, and desserts. Our dessert on this particular night was a house made Limoncello. It was not the best I have had and unlike the 'other' amazing VPN certified pizza place in PHX, you will pay for it as its not gratis. But it was still sweet and nice to try! La Piazza is a perfect location for finishing dinner and having a night cap somewhere in the vicinity of CityScape or again, Kettle Black next door. Another great wood fired pizza place in PHX to add to my list of pie greatness!",

    "text": "Came back here on a night where the owner Justin Piazza was putting part of their profits to work for their upcoming re-branding.  They are changing their name from La Piazza Locale to La Piazza PHX effective 9/1/2014.  Apparently Chipotle (yes, that Chipotle) is opening a chain of pizzerias called Pizzeria Locale nationwide and sued Justin to change his restaurant's name.  Not wanting to go broke fighting a corporate titan, they instead opted to re-brand.  While La Piazza isn't my favorite of the Downtown Phoenix pizzerias, its still great and more than worthy of support.  The place was much busier than my last visit.  This despite the fact that there were no sporting events or concerts this night.  Justin himself was manning the pizza oven and the restaurant was pretty close to full when I arrived.  I just came by myself this time.  They have a tiny bar area near the oven, but I opted for a small corner table instead.  This time I went with arguably their best and most popular pie, the Italian Stallion.  Four meats (sausage, pepperoni, cotto, and sopressata) on top of house-made mozzarella and San Marzano tomato sauce.  Its a pretty manly dish.  I've had this pizza before at their location in Glendale, but tonight it was especially awesome.  The meats were cooked perfectly and the crust was spot on.  This is the first time Justin himself has made me a pie so I'm guessing that made the difference.  Looking around the restaurant its pretty clear there are quite a few regulars as Justin and his wife were hugging and shaking hands with a lot of the patrons.  The wait staff is super friendly and laid back just as they were last time I was here.  The setup here is still a little bit quirky (particularly the bar area), but it seems like they're coming into their own.  I would still rank this 4th on my list of Downtown Phoenix Pizzerias (behind Pomo, Cibo, and Bianco), but the product and the pace of business is definitely improving.  Their name may change, but as long as Justin is making the pies, my enthusiasm for his pizzerias will remain the same.",

We showed up to find a mostly empty restaurant which led to great attentiveness by the wait staff. We ordered 3 margherita pizzas and between the 5 of us it was a perfect amount of food. The pizza was fresh out the brick oven and looked/tasted as much -- 10/10!  So why the -1 star, you ask? Well, the chalkboard when you walk in invites you to ask them about their \"New Craft Beers!\" When we asked the waitress, she advised that they do not have any craft beer yet. Soooo...why put that already on a sign? It was a bit disappointing but the pizza definitely provided a rebound to the experience. I will be coming back and recommend the pizza for sure.",

We mentioned the promised discount when the check arrived, but our young waitress had great difficulty figuring it out.  We reminded her that the check would also need spit two ways and when that happened the discount disappeared. She told us that we just couldn't see the discount... sure lady we couldn't see it because it was no longer there.

There were a handful of other diners in the place but several tables open.  When the hostess offered to seat us at a two-top, Jared kindly asked if it would be okay for us to take a four-top instead.  She hesitated but allowed us to do so, however told us that if a party of three or more came in, she would have to move us.  Understandable but kind of weird how she communicated it - with a bit of an attitude.    I did like the casual atmosphere and noticed that the have Coke and Coca Cola Light (not Diet Coke) bottles in a cute refrigerator.  I asked about them and learned that they are imported from Mexico.  Matteo was our server and he was knowledgeable on the menu and very friendly.  We ended up ordering a mixed green salad, a meat pizza (the Italian Stallion), and a pesto pasta to share.  Read: we haven't started our new year diet just yet ;)  The salad was chilled - it almost tasted like it was in the freezer prior to arriving to our table though.  The pizza was good and so was the pasta... although it was super creamy.  We skipped dessert as we were both pretty full.  The meal was fine but nothing to rush back for.  I also learned the hard way that carbing up on pizza and pasta is probably not the best pre-show meal.  I felt like I was in a food coma and Jared had to knudge me during the show to keep me awake!",

The pizza is incredible. Pure tomato flavor in the sauce. Speck. Speck is good. There is the promise of anchovies on other pies. Interesting flavor combos, crusts to crawl over broken glass for, wine recommendations that actually work, and staff who are helpful and attentive in a soothing way.

I've read a few write-ups about this restaurant, and decided to give it a shot. Our go-to Neapolitan pizza restaurant is usually Pomo, but after eating here La Piazza Locale has stolen that prize.  After being seated our server explained to us that they have draft cocktails. He described the cocktails in detail, and then offered samples if we would like. I sampled the Italian Margarita and the Lost Leaf. They Lost Leaf was quite good, and I liked it much better than the other one, so that was my drink of choice. For our entrees we chose the burrata pizza and the carbonara pasta.  The pizza came out super fast, as typical neopolitan pizza is cooked quickly. The pizza was parallel with the pizza we've had in Florence. The sauce was perfect, just the right amount of sweetness, but not overly sweet. The burrata was smooth and creamy, the basil was fresh, and the crust was cooked perfectly. Our carbonara came out a little later, it also was quite good. It had a rich cream sauce with egg, guanciale, peas, and pecorino. The crushed black pepper added a nice bite. We were offered dessert of tiramisu which was made that day. This was also fantastic, with rich layers of mascarpone and liquor soaked lady fingers. After a great experience here, we can't wait to return and try more of the menu.",

Host, waiter, and Matteo (from Italy within the past two years) were so genuine and warm.     We had the Rocco and it was amazing.    The Nutella dessert was incredible.",

I have often said there are 3 cities in which you can purchase an amazing pizza - Naples, Manhattan and Chicago.  I stand corrected - time to add Phoenix to the list.  This gem of a place imports everything from their tomatoes (San Marzano) to their cocktail ingredients (Campari, etc.).  The resulting pies are as good as anything you'll find in Naples, maybe even better because you don't have to deal with the autoestrada to get it.  If you are in Phoenix, go here - I will every time I'm in town.",

I had the Caprese followed by the \"Italian Stallion.\"  The Caprese needed more seasoning and the tomatoes could be more zesty and more fresh basil would've been nice.  The pizza was very satisfying. I'd come back again.",

I came here before a comedy show and was just driving around aimlessly looking on yelp at random places with good reviews. I sat right at the bar in front of the wood burning pizza oven, ordered the Italian stallion (don't forget to ask for basil and oregano!!) and a glass of wine. The pizza was incredible!!!! The sauce tastes just like my Italian grandfather taught me to make. The crust was devoured and even ate all the little meat crumbles off the plate. The servers were all very nice even with it being so busy on a Saturday night. Will definitely come back!",

Only thing I was kind of missing, and it's not a big deal was the lack of beer on tap, preferably a local craft brew type. Would love to see some local breweries represented. Other than the lack of beer on tap this place is the shizz!! Will be back for sure.",

Service was more interested in Whatever drama was happening amongst employees that night and was outside on front sidewalk most of the night.  Plus, they don't have a full bar and was out of just about every beer on their menu. Pizza was good, however is comparable elsewhere with fresher ingredients and better service and more selection Overall, there is better places to go, but edible.",

    "text": "O...M...G...So AMAZING! First, I admit I don't write reviews, I read them, BUT, I had to for La Piazza Locale.  This place is the real deal. Like you are IN Italy.  I have been raving about their pizza for a few years (seriously, super authentic), and I always crave their calzone (pizza fritte) which is like heaven in your mouth (get extra sauce to dip the amazing crust.) BUT...then I ventured to the pasta, and I was blown away.  I am a back east girl, grew up eating authentic Italian food and Sunday gravy, and I am telling you their Ragu Nepoletano (with cheese--a must) was absolutely unbelievable. Each bite I could not believe this was from my little unassuming downtown joint. The pasta was delicate and perfectly cooked (tasted homemade to me), and the gravy, mmm mmm mmm the gravy (pasta sauce) was heaven: savory and rich-but-light and perfectly seasoned, the meat was super tender and melted in your mouth with the pasta, and the imported cheese topping it off; I am telling you it is the BEST Italian food I have had in 25 years (and that includes when I go back home I admit!)  Plus, the portion is so generous, there is enough for two. I am obsessed and you will be too.  As I mentioned, the pizza is amazing, the flavors just burst in your mouth, whether a simple Margherita or a more complex choice - everything is amazing, fresh and satisfying.  They use products that are certified Italian (D.O.C.) and you can taste it.  I haven't tried everything because I am prone to cave to my obsessions, but I cannot imagine there is disappointment on the menu.  The restaurant is unassuming and simple, but it belies the amazing food within. Delicious.",
